Well any enemy besides bosses should always be about ammo conservation over DPS because you just don’t need it.
---

---
As for bosses, I have a vamp limb damage minigun that shreds so
---
---
---
You can get them once fore initiate, once for Paladin, and once for elder.  If you do elder you roll all three at once and can get up to 3.
---
Same tbh.
---
But, the boss also has to die in those eight minutes..
---
i dunno about that. i use the old guards smg and I'm still rising in ammo, with the dps to boot
---
🤣
---
Hmm, don't think so. My 1* quad DB still gets 'magic' damage with my blocker armor.
---
It's amazing how well the system works when you understand it, right? Imagine if people spent more time researching then coming on here and complaining.
---
This. Theres no player difficulty to choose on an MMO like FO76.  The PVE is established and you just have to deal with it.  There’s some games I might put on easy mode so I can just cruise the story line and there’s others I want to invest into the hard mode challenge.  This game isn’t FO5 where individuals can set the difficulty even for First members.  In fact when I play alone it almost feels harder because everything has adapted to me at high levels.  It feels like when I just started the game.  The new struggle makes it all novel again.  And that’s what so many veteran players needed. I’m willing to bet that most players have been here awhile.  So now the game has adapted to that.  So brand new players will have a different experience than players a year ago had.  NPCs, new stories, rebalances, etc.  To me that’s what makes it exciting to be a part of it.
---
Sounds like someone has found the root, now quick pull it!
---
I usually just drop all my 1\* stuff in front of the machine at the purveyor so others can use what they need to hit daily scrip limit.
---
You expected more tho. The game was what it was advertised minus the bugs.
---
Well of course you will probably always rise, the question is how fast
---
The pipe is life...
---
Everywhere was the beginner area.
---
Mole miner in an excavator suit would be rad as heck
---
And you think fallout is the onky game that has problems with items dissapearing, bugs and stuff like that?
---
Man even those extra special points you get. I mean 6 slots (I didn’t add all 6 as special) but that’s an extra 24 special points for your build. That’s nearly an extra 50% of available perk card slots.
---
Only time ot drops random ammo for me is when I kill with a knife
---
Yes. Its funny how all of a sudden every critique gets dismissed as BETHESDA BAD, I WANT FREE STUFF! 
---
Where are those posts? I just see desperate newbies and mid range players who want to actually play the game, but they get shot down with oh so witty "sarcastic" posts with 1500 up votes, that are seething with hate and vitriol.
---
Holy fuck people. Please be decent. They dont want to play another game and they dont want free shit - they just dont know what to do.
---
Come on, I almost dont recognise the polite, helpful community came to love anymore... at least in this sub. We can find a solution to this, Bethesda said so itself.
---
We are better than this.
---
Yea takes 1-2 shots to kill anything on ops and ammo return is great get about 200+ ammo back at the end of mission rewards
---
Thanks, I thought it might be that
---
~~2mm EC doesn't benefit from Batteries Included, maybe they nerfed it, what a bummer 😒~~
---
Ignore, I was looking at the wrong number, time for bed 🙄
---
I was impressed by this little detail. Is good!
---
Thanks, will do
---
G R I N D!!
---
In the last two days I’m one set of galleria plans from four attempts. 3 no rewards. RNG amirite
---
Thanks for the reply, will update and try again
---
Oh
---
Nope. I’ll keep playing and providing critique all I want. If I feel like moving on I will. Many times I play other games and still come back to 76 to see what’s changed. I’ll stay as long as I feel like it. 
---
Here’s a PSA for you: if you don’t like the complaints on the subreddit, maybe find a different one.
---
Rare ones; jumps Suits etc or new ops stuff
---
Dude, you hit the jackpot right there!
---
Pa is still good but you can always go for uny Secret service armour. High defense
---
Don’t feel bad, at least you don’t get kicked off teams for being too low level. It’s happened to me multiple times now, also on pc. I can’t kill anything but at least I can help the timer move quicker.
---
If you have a 300+ main, then make a brand new alt, you get six Legendary Perk slots and all of the cards are unlocked for that brand new character. That’s more than fair. 
---
You also get 50 free perk coins at level 50 on each character. And if you plan pour your build, you’ll have a lot of potentially scrappable perk cards by the time you hit level 50. 
---
In my opinion, that’s a very significant benefit.
---
Ugh it does for me
---
I don’t know if it still does but berserkers used to show all your damages lowered. Nearly drove me insane one day when I accidentally equipped one and happened to look in my pip 🤣
---
Right, they aren't great effects, I'll agree. I've just had a lot of trouble finding legendary handmades so this is a big step up for me from my suppressor's handmade, thus I've got the nouveau riche mindset at the moment even though they're not that great.
---
It's precisely your last paragraph which has me torn. I don't know what is more practical; being always prepared for high-health, potentially tanky enemies with Furious, or being able to dispatch lower-health enemies that might overwhelm me with Executioner. With the weight of handmades it's almost out of the question to carry both. I'm leaning towards the idea that if an enemy has a small enough health pool to reach the 50% health point sooner, then the benefit of dispatching them  much faster might be smaller than just finishing the remaining 50% with a smaller bonus and being generally stronger against all health. I'll definitely run your number sequences against different health pool sizes and see how much I like each one. Thank you so much!
---
Just like trying to pick up your teammates in NW. Very frustrating.
---
Hate and love are not the same as complaining because you care. People bitch and moan about hints for the sake of it all the time, not because they care.
---
I made 2k last night and I have 13 fusion cores and 49 ult plasma cores and I never moved a bit
---
Some super mutants are female. Both sexes look alike. So not all have bootable nads.
---
Secret Service and Scout armor are the two best, imo.
---
Isn’t it thirty? Last rank is two points on the specials.
---
You're wasting you time trying to convey logic here. I've been trying to explain this exact same thing for 2 days and I've gotten nothing but heat. I've even gone as far as to volunteer my time to go over their build on my private server and got nothing but pushback.
---
Some players feel it's their right to ignore the perk system all together and love tap enemies to death. No consideration that the rest of us were stuck playing the lower right side of the map before the update.
---
You tell people to stop complaining while complaining because YOU don't want to see the posts? People do it because they care about the game and want change. You need to have both sides in here, one that only praises the game and other that complains about valid points (Like every single one listed), it's balance. Seriously though, why are you in this subreddit if the "complaining" bothers you so much? (Legit stop giving this guy gold)
---
As they said, sadly no.
---
Ohh I feel you. All my unarmed weapons are now script lol 😂
---
When did I say this? This is a conversation about fallout, not other games.
---
I dont have fixer.  6-8 shots each mob yes plus I did a few earls with a group without magic weapons
---
A bit easier now with daily ops give ammo and that ammo perk
---
I use a BE 50 cal. I dont use a ridiculous amount but I do use enough where getting back 4-16 bullets a body seems insanely low.
---
Unyielding takes grinding. Collecting a full set is time consuming compared to getting a set of t51b. I believe they should just allow the chassis give 50 carry weight instead of a str bonus increase instead
---
It shall be the Blackreach of Fallout 76!
---
I use q prime gauss minigun
---
I love how we have to work around Bethesda's problems smfh
---
Omg if it is 🤤. I’ll believe you I spent so long staring at them all trynna decide and not sober at the time it would have easily been missable
---
Patch 22 ruins the game and devalues all charakter developments and gear. Level scaling is cheap and dirt, the game needs to be fixed. No one wants max mobs everywhere.
---
Well your point made no sense. "I wasnt promised losing my weapon". Well duh, bugs and mistakes happen. Too many times for the case of fo76 but still
---
Bummer!
---
Wait, it stacks with the stew?
---
Nope lol, still does not work. Tried everything. The bethesda site where you can report bugs did not work. So yeah, not getting the atoms i think hahah
---
Also sneak attacks just outright don't work since the patch, meaning I may as well run and gun  because I'm doing just as much damage!
---
Thanks, this is definitely up my alley! I've been comparing the two for a few minutes now and the only thing that I wish it had was tank killer to see how DR negation plays out with different damage bonuses, but I'm probably overthinking it. Appreciate it!
---
So many games notoriously fail to mix new additions to games with their older content, even when it seems so easy. I kinda get it if the various content is dependent to specific dlcs, but when it's just content added to the game via updates....missed opportunities all around
---
I role Vangaurd SS armour set, with vamp club with swing speed when it comes to tanking, then switch off to quad tesla commando when crowd control is needed
---
Based on the Dev play thru I actually thought that daily ops would be challenging considering how many times they died.
---
Dang! I was wondering why they added so much rust to the existing AR skin, I thought it’s an incentive for us to earn this skin.
---
My point exactly, too many. The fact that bugs happen doesn’t mean people shouldn’t criticize them for releasing an unfinished product.
---
Take my up vote, they already fixed a problems I had with the game over the course of the last 12 months
---
I wish there was 2nd and really spicy insult after he kills the player
---
10 weeks from the 15th. So....according to the calendar on my phone and my fingers, November 24th if I did that right.
---
My two shot auto grenade launcher,even without searching for bodies and just grab on the go, ends up with a surplus at the end. Think it’s working out well as is.
---
Though I’m sad there’s no mini nuke drops. I’d bring the instigating mirv fatman for fun.
---
Shotguns are better
---
But you're acting like this is the first time it ever happened. Look at all the garbage games we have. Literally a dead market
---
Same, between that and the ammo from daily ops its the game has become way more enjoyable in terms of resource management
---
I wish it also cured Addictions
---
I just want them to come through on their promises. Such as FO1st get a discount in the store. Or at least just say why they choose not to. Thats just one of a few.
---
And Ninja also does next to nothing despite advertising 2-3x damage multiplier.
---
I would like a B/FFR Gauss mini, but Im trying to work my magic on getting the Unyielding SS gears I want, not working out so far.
---
I got two caged bulbs and a vault 94 stash.
---
I’m not against a respec option and with the introduction of legendary perks the current system is stupid but to say certain builds are now worse than before is just wrong . The same pecking order still exists , it just closed the gap a little bit between optimized builds and food builds
---
I trashed my old camera and made a new one, and it worked.
---
Was about to say the same, instead of autocomplete, we have this. For now, anyway.
---
I don't think 17 bucks a month is an overpriced subscription, I thinks there's not enough stuff included with fallout 1st to be worth the purchase
---
Had one say they just wanted to run around the forest and kill things with a commie whacker and now they can't anymore and it basically ruined the game for them. One saying they would hang out in the forest and just use guns that didn't work anywhere else.
---
Bunch of high levels with shit builds just running through the forest one tapping level 5 enemies because it's the only thing they could kill. Shit blows my mind. 
---
Instead of actually playing the game, they just stay in one area and kill the same weak enemies, and cry when Bethesda adds something to nerf the OP meta builds and rolls over them in the process. Yet if they would just make an actual build or at least some adjustments, they wouldn't have this issue.
---
But why fix it when you can complain about it, amirite?
---
just join/start a daily ops group. If you start one and wait people generally join
---
[removed]
---
More like 1/10th of my inventory with the weight perk. I have hundreds of chems, and I'm barely over 100 units of weight.
---
Thanks, I'll have to keep that in mind! That makes me feel like things might be more clear-cut towards Furious when I get Ground Pounder, because at the moment I am often forced to hip-fire at all the enemies that like to rush me and it's easier to hit another enemy or environmental object with a health pool with hip-firing's low accuracy and lose the Furious stack.
---
The ash heap has the imposter already, so there’s that.
---
That leaves the forest, valley and mire.
---
Of those, we have project paradise in the forest (ends in a level 100 prime creature), which is technically a boss, though a more formal boss event would be nice as well. Perhaps if we nuke deathclaw island, we cave in it’s surface to reveal a deathclaw echidna in an Enclave lab down there?
---
The mire has the Heart of the Swamp event, which honestly is a boss all on its own. The problem is that it isn’t set up for end game players, so my view would be to add a static vine heart somewhere in the world, and once nuked, the vines begin to spread like mad thanks to the rads. The fight would be a dps test, since the main target would be stationary, but it could be defend by hordes of enemies covered in strangler vines akin to puppet strings, and defeating larger and larger groups of enemies connected to the heart lowers its resistance to attacks.
---
As for the toxic valley... I think your mirelurk emperor is honestly fine. I can’t come up with anything there, because honestly, it’s the region I spend the least time in. The events are child’s play, the locations are not densely packed and there are only a couple quests up there. Not a single one of Beckett’s quests take you there, and the one Daguerre has goes slightly to the side of it at Clancy manner. Seriously, the toxic valley needs some love and something to make it more than fake snow land.
---
Yeah, woulda been nice to at least unlock the skin if the weapon isn't that exciting.
---
Someone made a video about it and called it haunted foosball table.
---
Daily caps are a malignant tumor on this game
---
Some of my stash is now useless. Ugh.
---
I joined 3 daily ops teams today and they all just stood around. People need a autoboot if they create the ops team and don't do anything for 10 minutes. I mean if you're getting your gear do all that before..
---
I thought the nerf was gonna be bad, but in all honesty.... 
---
Not being able to one hit kill everything with an axe makes the game a lot less brain dead.
---
Fallout music was supposed to be stuck in the 30's through 50's originally.  Beach boys was mid 60's but I can't help murdering things in game every time it comes on. 
---
That and In the hall of the mountain king on the classical station are the jams though.
---
Couldn't agree more. Especially now that xp is so easy to get thanks to the update. But of course people can't be satisfied with current rewards so they put their hands out and ask for more
---
Yeah, makes sense
---
I like to look at people's junk.
---
This isn't unique to this game or even to video games. In today's world any criticism is almost impossible to exist. The same could be said for critical thinking and common sense.
---
Sleep when yer dead. 😁
---
I'll try that with Super Duper because it has not worked once since the update. Thanks.
---
what's the legendary effects? I was hoping to level up a bow focused character with one wasteland and explosive bow sounds like a lot of fun.
---
We don't.......
---
I just pack really light or run around excavator with calibrated shocks
---
😂👏
---
Nope . That’s why you need to
---
1. Learn where the spawns are: each event has 2 spawns. Let the cows slowly come to a stop while you wait for the enemies and slaughter them
---
2. Using the crook: when you first use it use the sidearm button to switch back to your main gun so you can switch back and forth fast 
---
3. Let the 3rd cow wonder off: there aren’t any spawns on his route . Once you can’t move the other 2 cows any further , go get the 3rd cow. The other 2 cows are safe to just chill 
---
If I didn’t want all the plans from it then I probably wouldn’t do it either though
---
If only the Firestarter used an incinerator and that weapon was a reward from the event...
---
I just did an elder run where I got two war glaive plans. I can’t imagine the odds of that happening were very high.
---
Bandolier + High Capacity Backpack helps a lil
---
Well depends what you carry man. Personally I only carry my gun, ammo and I run survival shortcut that way i don't use room for chems and meds .
---
What level are you?
---
Carry weight bonus and weight reduction on armor, perks, and inventory management
---
Yes but I'm not changing one of my favorites to the staff. Itxs the main reason its a slog and I just never play it. You want them to go fast but they just won't. I just avoid this event now, it's just boring and the update didn't help much. I only played for plans but I feek I have all of them.
---
Hey are you using an auto rifle? I just tested with my 10mm modded semi auto vs a lvl 75 super mutant.
---
121 damage for a sneak headshot aiming down sights and 121 damage sneaky vats head shot.
---
Yup https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iupqbw/psa_this_is_how_daily_ops_rewards_work/
---
My suicider at westek just completely disappeared after I dropped him. No nukes.
---
Exactly!
---
I literally have all the strength perks that reduce weights. And batteries included for carrying around 50 fusion cores.
---
It's only two star, but it's Vampires +50% Limb Damage. Had it as a backup for funsies but it's actually pretty awesome. Don't even have any archer perks in there. Now I'm on the lookout for better rolls. Also, mind you, I'm only firing it in VATS. No manual aiming. Might be magical.
---
I use a backpack with chem mod to reduce chem weights.
---
Various armor pieces that reduce things like chems, ammo etc.
---
Certain perk cards can reduce weight like Traveling pharmacy or add weight capacity like Strong Back.
---
Get rid of anything you don't need. I drop a lot of ammo I don't need. You can convert it in the ammo converter if you have one.
---
I hear that. I know I’m gonna get shit for it...but I bought all 100 levels on day one...so now the game can still be fun to play for me instead of a chore or in my case a 3rd job...
---
Many of the plans are actively posted in the market page.
---
You missed the part where he was complaining that they were re-using the same game assets?
---
You don’t have to put it in your favorites . There is a side arm button that switches to your last weapon used
---
Vampire's power fist, puncturing mod.  Against Lvl 75 Super Mutant, no adrenaline or food/chem boosts.  Body shot.  Hidden.
---
With Ninja level 3:     496
---
Without:                      431
---
13% increase in damage output using Ninja3.  I tested this about 10 times and all were +/- 4 damage from the numbers listed above.
---
I have two modes when playing. Stocking and Slaying. 
---
If I’m stocking, I’m suited up in Excavator with shocks and have all my weight beneficiary perk cards. (Not to mention bobblehead, caps, and magazine cards.) 
---
If I’m slaying, I’m suited up in T-60 that’s not really well outfitted just yet but provides more defense than the excavator. And have all my perk cards towards damage.
---
I'm not buying your shitty game Todd.
---
I had someone join my daily ops team about 2 minutes after I finished on elder. I just ran it again.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think in general though, once the team has 2 or 3 people, just fire it up. If you're comfortable with soloing, go with just 2 and they can join if they want. If no one joins within a minute, back out and make your own team. Repeat as needed. Realistically tho, no one is going to be sitting doing NOTHING while they wait for partners, and people are going to want a second to clear the last mob, loot the box, stash junk, whatever.
---
Plus, the first minute or so isn't really sped up much by extra people, since the bonus for extra participants doesn't kick in until the 2nd repair is done.
---
Are you on PC? I am and have never seen that button before
---
I mean tbh, I'd find it challenging if I didn't have my high level gear. I can't consistently get solo elder on my level 34 alt, who only has a non-legendary semi auto handmade and combat shotgun. I think that means it's challenging?
---
If it isn't broken, don't fix it.  If you think you're doing fine, roll with it.
---
I use a level 50 backpack, plus all 4 levels of Strong back with bear arms, portable power, batteries included, bandolier, thru hiker, traveling pharmacy, and sturdy frame. I can carry around 380lbs outside of armor and 280lbs in PA. It also helps that I have a scrap box I regularly deposit building materials into. That said, I'm usually on the verge of overencumberance and my stash is usually close to max as well.
---
Well yea when I was a kid I could go weeks on 3 hours a night, but man I dunno if it’s that I’m in my 30s now or that ive got kids but I’m just tired all the time.
---
Agreed then.  Skinny puppy, Ministry and Led Zeppelin have been added to the game and I am gonna murder things.
---
Armor with wwr. Grocer's backpack. Traveling pharmacy. Bandolier. Sturdy Frame. That covers about everything I need to carry around.
---
If you're trying for them I'm sure you'll get em done faster than that, daily op, event, level up are the only ones that take actual time.  Good 15 minutes.  5 minutes for the crafting/eating/slay challenges.
---
I don't recommend playing like that though.. just play if you want, if you don't want to play then what are the rewards for anyway
---
Pa is even better now because of electric absorption
---
  Its been like that for awhile now especially on the XBOX, So I usually Shoot a couple &gt; Wait &gt; Shoot a couple &gt; Wait &gt; Shoot a couple &gt; Wait &gt; Dies..
---
I think in the end I need spring cleaning. To many unnecessary guns and armor that “might be useful if...” I carry way to many stimpaks (force of habit from other fallouts) . But these are all great ideas and suggestions. Just really need to delve deep into what is essential
---
I mean, im going to complain about the monetization of private servers until I die. That wasn't cool, Todd.
---
When I first saw the complaints pouring in I took my low level non-bloodies/junkie gunslinger with a WESTERN f***ing REVOLVER out for a spin and he was still popping heads off of level 50 Super Mutants in Grafton Steel. Keep in mind I haven't settled on that build so it's still work in progress. By no means am I a Bethesda fanboy as they seem to suggest by enjoying the update but I'm enjoying the fact that I can finally revisit content such as Leader of the Pack, Uranium Fever and not feel like I'm wasting my time.
---
dang, those effects don't even modify the damage. I can imagine an instigating one hitting super hard.
---
The BOS outfit from daily ops? I got it on my third run vs blood eagles. Right after I got the super conductor plan.
---
I am a bloodied melee build I see the nerf and know I get killed even faster
---
Yes! This happened to me several times already. I thought it was just me. 😂
---
If the team gets full an I’m not currently doing ops or gunna be able to join I’ll leave to make room for more that might. If I leave cause I don’t like someone I thumb down usually then leave 😆😆
---
That's what I'm assuming. This patch may have made shooting sticks at things viable with the right loadout.
---
Xbox here too.
---
I'm a 34 year old dad of three daughters, each spaced around 4 years apart. I haven't had good sleep in 12 years, and back then I was gaming for 12-18 hours straight on the regular. I play till I fall asleep and drop the controller on my nuts. 🤣

Literally I'm just trying to chill and play a game so I can forget the god awful week I had and I'm so excited to come home and play the new update just to die to a god forsaken mole rat, a fuckin mole rat I used to be able to one shot them and now I fucking die to them
---
You are in the city limits of watoga but we do not grant you the rank of citizen.
---
Glad that not everyone is getting this. I had one crash in the last six months and 4 in the the last three days. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
I want the camp rewards from the season. I love camp building but I’m cheap, so freebies are the best. If it weren’t for wanting those I wouldn’t put much effort in again. Once I get that prefab bunker I’ll sit back and relax.
---
Will there be another way to earn the jack o lantern plans? I was unable to participate in very many events last year so I only got one or two and was hoping to play catch up.
---
It should drop from one of the named enemies. He’s the one that’s at the top of the structure. Above where Lev is locked in.
---
I had a problem where he was exploding and his body was falling in the water not allowing me to loot him.
---
In one wasteland cockroach owns you
---
Yeah I had one crash the last six months and four the last three days so hopefully they get it fixed soon.
---
Lev will be in his room in the middle of the cooling tower, the doors locked by Lev's hideout key, which can be looted by killing Surge. &lt;--- wiki 👀
---
I'll be on later, with headset.  Gamertag: PSILENSER
---
Picked up the bowie knife on the table in the burrows a couple times too, bag if dicks.
---
Doesn't matter compared to pa's innate damage reduction
---
Glad the low level grind is working for you. It isn't for me. I can't take on a supermutant settlement anymore. I'm lvl 34, with a lvl 30 weapon it takes 6 headshots to kill one. With all available maxed damage perks.  
---
This game is unplayable for me. I have less than 100 ammo for my usable guns. My springs and screws are so I'm stuck with a broken gun. Shits broke yo.
---
I mean if we're honest with ourselves it would be about 5 hours of the event then another week before it came back because something critical broke again.
---
I’d probably hurt myself real bad at work if I were to put in those hours.
---
Yes. Last season I finished it with so much time to spare I was bored. Definitely not going to take it as seriously this time and NO buying of stages!
---
  So how did you get 7 levels in an hr at 390 because that equates to me getting 100 levels in the same time frame at my level 56...
---
thousands each ammo run
---
Yea and 400 stash limit back in the sweet ol days
---
Think about all those special points you could add with legendary perks too. You could run all those weight reduction cards you might have stayed away from in favour of damage and still have a fully optimized damage build.
---
Totally agree! I really wished they showed NW some love
---
Yo Bethesda, i think enuff is said. We should b able to wear underarmour under the PA... no fucking warriors in the real world will go into a PA without underarmour.
---
Make sense ya. I wont be surprise that u should also b able to wear our full set of body armour into a PA.
---
I appreciate you bringing light to this OP. I just got back on today after a long time of being gone (pre wastelanders). At level 38 I had what I thought to be an "ok"build before the patch, which focused mainly on V.A.T.S and guns, and now it takes forever for me to kill things that I used to be able to manage. This on top of the gun hit registering, which is delayed currently, my experiences have been dreadful to say the least. I don't mind harder difficulties but when I'm clearing a building for loot or quests and my weapons are breaking due to TTK it isn't to fun. Obviously you know I am not referencing the smaller enemies, yes they take more hits and that's fine by me, but super mutants took a lot of .50 cal before meeting their maker. 
---
My question is for someone trying to return within those levels though, is it better to restart all over even though I have been doing the questline or will it even make the experience better? I am mainly a solo player as well.
---
Edit: after reading most of the comments it would seem if your having trouble it's your build choice or weapons and armor being low level. Perhaps this is my current issue. Will have to do more research on my end but I'm guessing since I didn't do much looting and the old wasteland was never that dangerous this would be my culprit. 
---
Still would like input on if starting fresh for wastelanders is a good idea since I haven't played since release.
---
Iron maiden, Judas Priest, the list goes on
---
Awesome. Mine is ojShack inv me when your on
---
This is shameful
---
I hit elder for yesterdays daliy and todays daily and didnt get any rare rewards.
---
As a level 34 player with available damage perks maxed should I look into doing the daily ops. I don't want to try and hold the others back because I'm dead weight.
---
I can't believe Bethesda hasn't added this to the game.  2 years and this hasn't been addressed.
---
And yes, you can do this in a private server but I've had the world crash and lose what I'm moving.
---
Armor reduces ammo weight, backpack reduces chems. My 1 strength point is in strong back. Don’t really have issues.
---
Best ammo farm ever, was down to a couple of hundred ultracite 5.56, ran it a few times, now have over 999 lol.
---
I got a TSE/15 Vats faster fill. And yeah, it's really a good weapon, deal nice damage and saves ammo. Better than my previous FEminigun that wasted a lot of ammo.
---
I have the posters for the mascot. But no, never seen that outfit.
---
If you hit Elder on the first run, then that’s three rolls (5%/10%/80%) to get a rare reward. That’s character specific, so you could do it five times per account.
---
If you don’t hit Elder, you can keep running it until you do.  But once a reward roll has occurred, it can’t be rolled again that day for that character. 
---
Technically, you *could* get 15 rare rewards each day, per account. But that’s insanely unlikely.
---
I just noticed this also, on the suicider at Wes Tek.  
---
What's odd is, if I kill him with something explosive, he'll blow up, but if I kill him sneaky, there is no nuke on his body.
---
Executioners would be my recommendation if you're planning to pvp. 
---
You don't always get the chance to focus fire single enemies while ignoring their team. It's likely a mate of whoever you're targeting will want to capitalize on you being distracted. 
---
After landing a few hits on enemy#2 you've got him under cover but you reset your damage boost and #1 has healed. 
---
Executioners just seems to deliver sharper spike damage if you lead fights with a headshot or two then go for center mass to be sure you're boosted damage is hitting before they can heal or at a faster rate than they can heal. 
---
Furious isn't terrible for pve ime before patch 22. I used a 2* F10 HM for a long time after level 45. It kept me happy. Definitely prefer my BE15 or ExFFRFR HMs over it though.
---
This is why you want multiple characters. I go for Elder on each of my characters (4 characters ).
---
I found I had to add back all my sneak armor - shadowed leather, "harder to detect" pieces, shielded raider underarmor etc to restore my stealth.
---
Damn that would be sick. Honestly I'd even prefer if the water didn't get drained, but instead created pockets of land/islands so that it created like a style of game play where you might need to move between the islands to fight it because you can't use weapons while in the water and the boss was aquatic moving around the water, with only its back showing which is heavily armoured, so you have to.wait for it to stand up to shoot its belly. Damn, I want this event now
---
I like how their witty comeback is always about how your build just isn’t good enough like having to have an optimized build so that trash mobs aren’t bullet sponges isn’t a sign of terrible balance
---
I only have that issue with the Gauss... 🤔
---
My only real complaints now are that the game is incredibly hard now unless you use exploits in the system with "magic" weapons. And then the complaint I've had since Beta...NO TEXT CHAT. Seriously name one other MMORPG or hell any online game that doesn't have a text chat. It's fucking bullshit and Bethesda's dragging their god damn feet on this!
---
Confirmed. Use Shielded Raider Under armor too for +3 AGI.
---
I popped in for the first time in awhile today and my sneak build felt better than before
---
If Bethesda never gets negative feedback about what they're doing, the game will never get pushed in the direction the players want it to go.
---
Don't worry, you will have the chance to say Try Another World five or six times as it keeps loading you back on the same world.
---
Well, there's something about the Vault boy smile. I guess I'm gonna keep the smiling ones.
---
Dodge is the most recent NPC
---
Just looked this up. 100% down with that, I want it right now. It's like a giant fishy deathclaw
---
Nah , it’s left on the d-pad on Xbox . Check your settings for hot keys and you should find it
---
Vernon Dodge
---
Next update they limit how many levels you can gain a day
---
It’s got to be days.  I missed 8 or 10 days on the first season (missed all of the double score weekends) and still finished without doing any NW stuff. This season has more offerings for score even.
---
The first daily ops team I joined was led by a level 4. I'm respeccing my build to solo the ops.....
---
Nope. I went straight at it. If they change things and I have to earn more coins to respec, then I have to play a really fun game some more. No big deal.
---
&gt;think again before using that gnasher grenade!
---
*Always* think again before using the Floater Grenades.  That blast radius is so ridiculously small.
---
So if Maram and Dodge are both living in Watoga and the sign says 2. I don't understand the problem
---
Pain
---
They r accumulating quite a number of bugs on this game... wonder how can they solve it all...
---
I'd say that it is mixed bag from what I've seen. I've had level 200+ that run off just to farm kills and consistently went down outside of the uplink. I also had a run with a level 12 that played back and only pushed up when we moved to loot ammo and stayed in the uplink the entire time. As long as your playing to the objective and contributing I would say go for it! Also a small tip: If you go down inside the uplink area don't immediately go for a respawn, most people will give you a revive and you still contribute to the unlink progressing!
---
Do the melee legendary perks with melee buffs (hack and slash) work with unarmed weapons(deathclaw gauntlet)
---
Man the Legendary run was so stressful, because they kept auto completing regardless of what time I played!
---
Did you read it before playing? It had all the info you needed.
---
What part do you need help understanding?
---
I absolutely love Halloween...however last years event was kinda garbage. It just wasn't very good or fun but it was something to do...
---
I think it's a little silly to not have it this year...given as you pointed out...THEY HAD A WHOLE GOD DAMN YEAR TO FIX IT.
---
Seriously Bethesda...what's your fucking excuse? You guys don't have one do you?
---
I'm fed up with Bethesda...this last patch sucked any fun and joy I was having right out of the game and they continue to just do stupid shit.
---
Forest  urban can't mix
---
Is it supposed to change based on irl characters?
---
It read one when I walked in, it should've said two. 
---
With two players and two NPCs it should've said four.
---
It used to.
---
Wait, so the perk itself auto-unlocks items if you simply look at it? Or do you still need to press a button when prompted?
---
Not really man, I’m not even the one complaining about the game. I mentioned that. I’m saying I understand why someone who spent $60 would be angry. It’s not that it’s the first time, it’s that it happened
---
And NV is literally Fallout 3 in the game data with all the bugs from Fallout 3 in it. I really don't get your point.  
---
76 is a good game as well.  You can't say bugs are bad because NV is arguably one of the buggiest Fallout Games and had arguably one of the buggiest launch.  If you strip away the server issues that were unique to 76 I would argue they are on par with absolutely shitty launch in a game that didn't function at all.  NV was infamous for deleting people's saves as they tried to leave Goodsprins on launch. They actually had to remove a lot of non essential NPCs from the game until they could stabilize it.
---
You don't live in Watoga. 2 people live there. The sign changing was likely an indicator to show that the population has increased with the arrival of Dodge. It doesn't change for players because you reside somewhere else. If the sign is updating everytime you arrive at Watoga it is likely a bug
---
?? The entrance hole has nothing to do with whether or not you can actually get in
---
sometimes pops up with combat shotguns too now
---
It looks terrible
---
Nah you just need to know where to look. The wooden I'd blocks are litters everywhere there is an unmarked settler camp out in the mirror close to the world border the is a blanket on the ground with 60 of those blocks, that and paint cans and pencils are also everywhere lead is very plentiful you just need to actually look.
---
Backpack mods help. Special rolls on Armor and Weapons that reduce weight on certain things, and all around, i don't carry stuff i wont use. I'm a Junkie so I only carry what I need, dont need weapons for everything, just what I require.
---
Should you be considered part of Watoga’s “population”?
---
Level 154 here. I shouldn't have to abuse exploits in the game by using a "magic" weapon to kill things so I can play the game. I mean it fucking works but I shouldn't have to do it. My gear is crap since RNG hates me and I never get good drops. My perk loadout is a fucking mess (though with some help from people on here I did pick some perks that seem to be helping a bit more). I was never a killing machine even before the patch...I'm still not but at least I can sort of kill things faster. But again...by using a "magic" weapon.
---
It's not perfect...and it's not fun.
---
It's changed when a player walks into town since beta.
---
i found this happening if i switch characters but not sure what causes it. i am reasonably certain that you can prevent it by looking at the scoreboard when you first load into a world (its worked for me so far)
---
5.56 isn't terribly hard to create a lot of. I usually make around 2k per farming round.   
---
I've personally not found challenges really any more difficult save I actually have to use a stimpack or 2 which is fine because I have like 200+ normal and super ones.
---
Lets form a riot and burn down whitesprings
---
Farming ammo is the easiest grind in the game. You can't exactly complain about weight with that kinda ammo too.
---
ACP whenever up for acid. A run through LHM for a few hundred lead, then Uranium Fever/Monongah/Grafton Steel for weapons to scrap for steal. Making Ultracite you get thousands for maybe 20min of work.
---
You wanna know what ammo is actually deserving of being annoying? .308 when you're using an MG42. 1 craft isn't even enough for a single mag.
---
Yeah I noticed that stuff would die while I was reloading...the hits are taking awhile to go through.
---
It's been doing that since beta, if it's not a bug it's a very odd change.
---
Anyone know how to use the health kits, I don't see them in inventory
---
i had that happen and i still got the SCORE for it - maybe it thinks each reward level is a separate op?
---
I run a fun 2shot AGL that’s a blast to play. As long as you don’t mind never finding half the bodies to loot lol
---
Gotta keep repeating this line while scrapping. Lol
---
Ah did not know each level got you a chance at a rare...though it each level had different loot pools. Well I'm extremely unlucky I guess...I've only gotten 1 rare out of the 5 days.
---
Idk man, Master Infiltrator? I’m really happy to have those two wasted points out of perception and into intelligence now. And Auto Unlock on most things is a huuuge time saver for me.
---
Batteries included lets me hold my 100+ 25% fusion cores for my ultracite gatling laser. And I only use about 150 carry weight for armor and weapons. Chems is tied to my backpack and thru hiker for my food and water.
---
I've found my power armor losing absolutely no durability during ops.
---
actually, it might be because i have... power patcher(? i can't remember which one, the INT power armor perks all have basically the same name) which reduces durability loss. maybe it's stacking with the reduction from ops?
---
The other players had a blue knot and bar. I completed it 3 x and did not get that.
---
I was excited the first time it happened. Had visions of completing the run on day one.
---
I dont know about others but my expectation with the daily ops group is that we'll start the event not long after we get a full team. Its the one team I dont really hang around in after the task is completed.
---
I was able to get my oil changed while waiting for the second shot to pop off.
---
I have +fire rate on my gatling and I really liked how it was with Speedy Receiver, but man, that damage from the Prime is nice.
---
Don't think I'd be able to go back to a gatling without that legendary effect.
---
My gf got the BOS outfit on her first try.
---
Also it doesn't count anyone in Watoga underground... and there's a lot of people there!
---
Yeah didn’t work with the sq weapon mods either
---
I was able to get lucky and got a 2 really good gatling guns from the purveyor during the sale.
---
I've been saying this for months!
---
The Forrest has the Alpha from Project: Paradise.
---
The Savage Divide now has Earl Williams from Colossal Problem.
---
The Cranberry Bog still has the Queen from Scorched Earth.
---
The Ash Head still has the Imposter Sheepsquatch from Encrypted.
---
The Mire should have the Interloper with Mothman mobs. 
---
The Toxic Valley should have Mad Dog the Behemoth.
---
We either need need Raid Bosses to replace old ones of a new region.
---
i got kicked from an op group while fighting the last boss yesterday, it was super annoying. just suddenly teleported outside for no reward.
---
Back then I was an HVAC mechanic. 🤣 On roofs half asleep. Good ol' days.
---
That would have been, just wow.
---
Honestly the only thing I really want from the Season Two board is the Greenhouse C.A.M.P. Building Set, but seeing that it's the Level 99/100 reward, it's not worth it. 
---
I'm otherwise largely taking a hiatus from the game until Perk Loadouts and the new BoS story content comes in the Season Three/Winter update. Hopefully Bethesda will make the Greenhouse Set one of the items you can purchase with gold bullion then, like they've done with some of the Season One S.C.O.R.E. rewards in Update 22, but even if they don't, I can live without it.
---
I spent 80 on this game and yes it was a let down and i left it after a month, i just came back and it is so much better than what it was, so fuck all people crying all the time
---
They can justify that by saying it's a maintenance area and therefore doesn't feed the population signs.  We know it's because they added human NPCs.
---
Cool cool cool. So I stopped playing just after the first “season”. I needed a break, besides I have a huge 360/XB1 library. Also all my old N64 stuff. I logged in for an hour yesterday and decided to play less now with the one wasteland.
---
If I still had FO 1st I could do farming runs. I loved legendary perks, it gave me a chance to clear out old cards and use the 13+ levels I had saved up. 
---
One wasteland is just not for me. I’m not salty about it I just choose not to play it
---
System?
---
This is why I always have, and always will help new players. Now more than ever. Free armour, weapons and stims. AND I’ll help ya make a good build like myself.
---
In a public team that bar and knot shows a bond has formed with the other players in the team. For daily ops public teams you gain and additional 25% exp for completing a daily op, per player, for a maximum of 100%
---
I have hundreds of disease cures and idk where I got them but I can't find 1 god damn addictahol so unless this machine can cure me of that I literally have no room for it
---
&gt; I can't take on a supermutant settlement anymore.
---
I have noticed some enemies being entirely too tanky. Just earlier I read a post about how enemy health is scaling faster than our weapon damage. A developer commented that there will be adjustments coming down the road.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iuc6yy/health_scaling_and_the_biggest_problem_with_one/
---
&gt; My springs and screws are so I'm stuck with a broken gun.
---
I'm playing in a private world so I have no competition when it comes to the junk available. I can very easily imagine there being little to no gears, screws, and springs available if you happen to join a server that has been active for a while since I only recently started using Fallout 1st.
---
I never left the game, even with the bugs I enjoyed it with friends and solo.
---
That isn’t unique to Special Ops. That’s displayed for any Public Team. 
---
That’s your bond rating with them. For each bond you get one more rank in the Public Team’s bonus effect. 
---
Like, for Casual, you get +1 Intelligence just for being on that team, even if you’re by yourself. For each bond you gain (max of three), you get another +1 Intelligence.   Get all three bonds, that’s +4.
---
Same thing for Spec Ops teams. Each bond you get +25% XP from Special Ops. Get bonds with the other three players and that’s boosted to +100% XP.
---
so im prolly gonna get down voted here, but I play a meta build heavy explosive PA, and I have to say, post update, the scorchbeast queen fight was actually easier, and regular enemies are harder, that is balance that this game needed, I used to one shot every mirleurk king with one round of a 2 shot explosive getting gun, now they actual are decent to fight. I see this as a good thing, slowly the game is becoming better. ANYONE who has to complain that this game is pay to play/win should try ESO for a month lol.
---
On a side note, anyone notice how slow the submachine gun shoots? For a gun based off a lead sprayer like the Thompson, it sure is underwhelming
---
I ditched the bloodied build with the new update and went back to my old high health build. But I use a two-handed melee weapon, so I don't have to worry about heavy guns or ammo. I have the grocer's backpack mod so I can carry enough food and water, and I only carry like 40 stims and radaways, so chems aren't overburdening me. Stims are easy to get, so I'm not worried about needing too many or ever running out.
---
I'm flying my responders flag at half mast for you!
---
You see, though, as someone who has never played NV it is completely irrelevant to me. It's whataboutism, just because some past game was buggy doesn't give Bethesda a free pass on releasing some other buggy game.
---
   
---
The point I'm making is that 76 was made with as little effort as possible in order to make as much profit as possible with zero regard for the players. Every step of the way it has cut corners and often makes the situation worse when trying to fix things. The game is designed to milk the fan base while they 'develop' a MTX  strategy and always-online format for future games. They should paying US to beta test.
---
Messaged you about them.
---
Exactly...
---
Depending on your weapon choices, I use a chemist backpack, bandolier, thru hiker, sometimes bear arms, and at least two armor pieces with weight reduction. I personally pick heavier weapons with a 90% weight modifier
---
Low level builds should spec for suppressor/crippling and dr/er/rr/health. Any perks that debuff enemies. Straight DPS is not aa effective at lower levels when it is harder to survive. As you level up add more damage perks. At higher levels and better gear, you can balance between tankiness and damage.
---
Aye thanks lad
---
well no house is built on those thatched walls... those are literally for porches? use the concrete foundation to better match.
---
Replace evasive with life giver
---
True or False: If I make a new Daily Ops Team its OK to wait 5 mins before starting the Op so that everyone's public team bonds sync up.
---
I always take a maxed Blocker on every toon.. ignoring 45% of incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
😂😂😂
---
Oh Bethesda.
---
I disagree. First come, first serve.
---
You have 7 unused points...
---
[Edit:]
---
▪ No matter your build, go for these 8 perk cards as soon as possible ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;w=lm2au2at1ik0if2ii0iq2p10 ).
---
They are quality of life improovement and they are extremly necessary to make your endgame experience as smooth (pleasant) as possible. Content in the endgame (+lvl50) require you to be as self-sufficient as possible. Enemies are tougher, hit harder and activities can put you against real bulletsponges !
---
At this stage of the game, you really need to be ready. You must know how to mass craft ammo and repair your stuff efficiently. Because if once lvl 50 you focus only on polishing your build while you have none of these perk cards, trust me you will cry ! Everything will be too expencive to craft or repair, it will just be a messy grinding endgame experience for you ! 
---
You really want these perk cards before hitting lvl 50.
---
Focus on maxing these perk cards and your main weapon perk cards. They must be your priorities.
---
Also, go as soon as possible get the "Excavator" power armor plans ( a quick google research should get you on the good path ). 
---
Once lvl 45 you need to focus on building this baby so you can start farming some lead ore in the "Lucky hole Mine" ( another quick google research should get you on the good path )
---
And to finish, install your camp next an Acid deposit so you can place an Acid extractor on it ( once again, a quick google research on "resource deposits locations" should get you on the good path ). You'll need Acid to turn your lead ore into useable lead. 
---
Here the perk card "Super duper" will really be helpful...same when you'll be crafting ammo. The "Scrapper" perk card will allow you to take full advantage of weapon dismentling. You will never be out of steel for your ammo.
---
If you do it right, once lvl 50, polishing your build will be...smooth and easy. You'll have a pretty decent dps, no ammo issue and enough resource to fix your guns &amp; your armors ( as long as you don't stop scavanging and grabbing your loots ).
---
It was a copied/pasted text. This question is often asked, so i saved this text in a file. 
---
✌
---
There was a grafton monster outfit??
---
Makes sense with the double score week ending on 23rd. Thanks!
---
Ouch, I dont want to picture that!  lol
---
also.. [I run a Full Health Non-Addicted Sneaky Vats-Crit Commando similar to this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2p00pg2ph2pi2e82e00c72cu0i11ic2a72ar0an0a02a31ao0lb0lv1lt2lr2l71sb0s00lk2po0&amp;w=c52i30ii0ij2ia0if2ik0i50iq2at1lm2pa0p10p70p30p90p80&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=13-16-1h-10-1d&amp;wp=w6w6w6&amp;wm=17-17-1j)
---
One Wasteland got it wrong imo. I sink a fair bit of disposable income to the game. But I've just cancelled my Fallout 1st Sub and am uninstalling the game. There, I'm doing what you've advised.
---
One question though. If everyone with an issue uninstalls and finds another game, how long do you think thy game will last? The people you're telling to bog off are the very same keeping the game afloat. You jackass.
---
I preferred the old way. Where I could chill in lower level areas and farm. Or head to the bog for a real fight. One Wasteland has made everything a chore. Fun is gone so goodbye and thanks for all the fish (until its tweaked).
---
Lmao.  No doubt and honestly I think we can all see that happening....lol
---
I like how y’all can stay involved after update I came back but nothing seemed to interest me am I that bored of it ??
---
I had the same thing, I thought it might have been because I jumped in twice with no one, didn’t finish then joined a full group and finished it
---
Because they’re straight up fascists. All the apologizing, indignant defensive babbling and downvotes won’t change that.
---
Cool outfit, though.
---
PS4! I knew I forgot something lmao
---
Level 408  I was able to scrap a lot of cards and didn't open any cards pack and level ups over the last 6 months.
---
I'm so jealous... What does she want for it? Caps? Guns? Armor? My first born?
---
GO play the lotto! haha
---
It's not as bad as needing to do the rep dailies, I gotta say.  
---
It's also so much nicer that the enemies scale so the repeatable exp challenge gets done a lot without trying, I usually need to go out of my way to do 1 challenge per day just to hit the bonus of doing 5 challenges and it doesn't exactly take long, I'm already rank 20.
---
Bummer my toons learned the plans, I figured I’ll probably keep getting more lol
---
What if I can only play like 3 days out of the week? Do you think I could have a chance
---
I have this too.  It's infuriating.  Fastest way to get it to stop is to do a quick daily, like Pumpkin House.
---
and share useful perk cards you lazy bums
---
Yep they could even be awesomer if they have a chance to spawn as legendary
---
Change servers
---
Preach
---
My hubby plays every day and so far I am 2 spots behind him.. I love the game but not nearly  as committed. If I keep this up, am sure to finish. Had to spend a few atoms to finish last season but with the 500 at the end, it was a good 400 atom investment I think.
---
No worries was just a thought hehe
---
Someone bought a Liquid Courage recipe from my vendor for 15,000 caps lol. Probably could have gotten even more if I wanted to bother with trading... Now's the time to dump all this stuff while people are too impatient to wait.
---
I bought the new BOS recon gas mask from a vendor for 5k caps and don't regret it though. It looks very... adult alternative... when worn with my clean Chally outfit.
---
my health is relatively high for a non STR build @ 6
---
I try to have armor pieces with weight reductions which helps as well
---
I proposed a giant deathclaw, giant mothman and giant behemoth. Godzilla vs mothra vs king kong ftw! One for each nuclear power plant. If you nuke all three, they fight each other at white springs!
---
Ya finish how you want!
---
I feel your issue, but with ultracite plasma and fusion cores. They aren't rewarded out till the very end
---
My tent is placed where I need it. Your camp means nothing to me.
---
She’s rocking it because she’s also a fan of the bos. She was originally rocking the BOS jumpsuit. The blue jumpsuit with the BOS logo on the back. But now she’s rocking that tactical BOS suit.
---
Man I wish the vault girl and boy mascot heads would return soon 🙏🏼
---
That's fair- the healing thing is the one thing I'm concerned about though. I don't do much pvp but legendary enemies mutating faster than I can do damage with executioner worries me. As for the specific variations you mentioned, the FFRFR definitely seems like it'd push the Ex above, but seeing as mine have no secondary effects worth mentioning (Furious one has extra vat crit damage but I don't use vats much), would Furious be similar, worse, or better than only Ex?
---
It isn't unreasonable to expect a game to actually function.
---
As a non-PA, full health build I usually have around 170 lbs. of free carry weight out of around 310. I don't do anything special to make it better. I'm sure I could optimize that, but I rarely have carry weight issues. Just stop back at my CAMP or a vendor periodically.
---
What sort of damage from wendigos or Yao Guai do you guys take? I’ve been running BOS sturdy combat armor for about 200 levels without power armor and can take 2-3 hits with the ironclad perk equip. I do run full health but none of my armor matches in terms of main legendary perks. I just try to make sure I had life saving and the auto stimpack one.
---
True, but its functioning just well right now
---
I assume it's a daily op reward. Which means the longer the game goes, the more of these outfits will go in circulation and the demand will decrease as well as the price. It's rare at the minute but in a few weeks most people who do the ops daily will have it.
---
By being selective about what I carry. My berserker has a backpack and that’s it. You have to be real careful.
---
15 years of Warcraft, never had a problem. They even have a website where I can go to restore items if I accidentally deleted them. Takes a minute to use.
---
it was unplayable at launch incurring me cost to buy and play a different game.  your analogy doesn't work.
---
But that is why they eventually offered refunds as they should have.
---
“Maybe find a different game” A lot of people already have. Go to Twitch any time of day and see how far down the list Fallout 76 is (if you can even find it).
---
I don't think the enemies drop them because the ultracite ones have to be crafted. Normal plasma/fusion cores do drop, I think.
---
And then spawns you a couple of miles from your camp. Or is that just me?
---
Just got it from today's daily ops how do you craft it? I checked the chemistry work bench and couldn't find it.
---
Especially if it allowed items like the giant mr fuzzies or the power armor helmets. I got two of the "Old Man Winter" PA helmets. Simultaneously the worst &amp; best luck I've had in this game.
---
You had a year to fix it though.
---
We've seen them all, but they can still be randomized, so invisible super mutants in the burning mine, or freezing blood eagles in the Burrows, the combinations are what can make each experience different. Plus as of right now the only daily op we've done is Up Link, where the piercing gaze in a guaranteed mutations, outside of up link, we can have many different combos.
---
How much ammo do you get from other events?
---
Another machine gunner here, and totally agree.  Feels a bit shitty to complain since we actually get some .50 rounds back now, but yeah, I get back maybe 10-15% of the rounds I burn through, while those using any other ammo are leaving with well more rounds than they came with!  An adjustment for this would be great, but either way, I’m still loving the daily ops.
---
Ok and they are 2 completely different games coded completely differently. Bethesda needs a new engine tho
---
Yes
---
Depends on the criticism.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
---
I did experience this today, but only once. However with my current set up I can make 9 mini nukes per craft so my two shot fat man is getting plenty of use, even if it is underpowered. Bombs away!
---
I've had two great runs with three and four people from ops teams just going to the ops. They don't need coordination just people who know how to fight.
---
100% agree when I saw the half sentry bot half assultron boss in day one from the burrows I was like WTF IS THAT!? Looked like a robot mashup from automatron DLC in fallout 4.
---
Don’t give them ideas lol
---
Yea.. they were a nightmare before.. now the enemies are way worse.. especially those...
---
I’m a machinist, nothing like rotating equipment while drowsy
---
No I’m not not I’m running 15 str 12 int 14 agi and 9 luck
---
It could also use the green border like the camp build menu so people will stay in the radius
---
This is my exact perk setup as well.
---
You explained it perfectly thanks, i had this 100% of time.
---
Still interested?
---
Also ultra light on all armor.
---
If that’s the only issue you’re focusing on, you’re just as bad as the cry babies
---
A great deal of idiocy on Reddit is just due to everyone posting and making 2 primary mistakes:
---
1.  Not including myriad information about what/why/when, what platform, level, etc. in addition to the issues they are experiencing.
---
2. Too many gamers ignore the information (see number 1) that could be a problem and are dismissive or antagonistic because \*they\* don't have an issue.
---
Information and consideration of an absence of information causes the majority of issues that plagues most humans.
---
Who is doing daily ops teams but not doing them? That makes no sense what's the point then they just want other people to finish it so they get the elder reward?
---
I don't know, actually, but I burned through a ton more in the op than I usually do so I don't think it's an apples to apples comparison.
---
I got it too on Xbox yesterday when I logged in, only happened once but it ranked me up through the levels I'd already gotten, really annoying for a couple minutes. But fortunately disappeared, even when hopping servers
---
The math in those old posts weren't correct. It was 100% doable without doing every daily or buying any.
---
I'm level 22 and, fuck I enjoyed this game when I was playing it last month.  
---
I stopped playing because I heard they were gonna add level scaling, so, being lvl 22 and seeing people that are lvl 221 around I thought "Oh well, this'll make the game a bit easier to get into"
---
I finally logged in today after redownloading the game over 3 days and shit, after around 2 sessions of 2 hours I have lost all my bullets. All of them. I run out of lead to craft more. I was running to a quest marker and I lost my shit because there were 3 Rat pups in my path, they were too damn fast to hit without VATS (shitty internet) And they took 10 shots each! I tried doing my regular event in the agricultural center to get my 10 robots for the daily and every damn Mr Handy took well over 15 shots of my only legendary rifle! Look I don't want to bitch but I think the level scaling may just be a Biiiit overtuned for the early game.   
---
I still enjoy the game but I'm gonna stay away until it the level scaling gets tuned a bit because I have no idea what I'm gonna do about ammo.
---
It has the "search ring".... i just stand right next to the beacon.
---
Its not as good as 2shot anymore considering the nerf
---
theres also a dead mole miner with loot in the wall
---
I just feel like my time on my alt was wasted, I should have been grinding my main to level 300 to unlock those perk card slots. Loving the system though otherwise.
---
Still not sure why this is a thing,
---
that would be so cool. They gotta pull it off right tho and have it be comedic with the translator or I would be disappointed
---
I’d like to see separate stashes ,one for weapons ,one for armour and so on :D it’s how I set up my camp in fallout 4.  The weight capacity could vary differently as the armour one wouldn’t need to be a full 800 ,but weapons for sure need 800.
---
The Sheepsquatch Imposter: "Am I a joke to you?"
---
(People with Electric Absorption: "Yes.")
---
Well, I killed them with my vffr flamer, just burn them all. They will show themselves when they on fire.
---
I’m sorry. It if my teammates want to run dailies 9826267283777474 times ..... and I don’t....... I won’t.
---
I still haven't managed to get the BOS jumpsuit myself. Been trying to grind for it but I'm just not lucky
---
:shrug: lots of people. At least that is my experience in most servers on PS4
---
Not just you; same thing happens to me on occasion.
---
With those two choices I’d lean for furious. However, I personally prefer to just stick with antiarmor. Since the handmade is way heavier than it should be, to me it makes more sense to have a well rounded, lower effort version. For me that means nothing that I’ll have to switch to just for a little bit more damage, I’d rather just hold down the trigger.
---
I started about a month ago. I made 2 characters. One to figure things out, understand the game, spent about 110 hours on that and then after I knew the available perks, understood the game dynamics, what exists, what's what.
---
Before the patch my struggle was walking into a place at level 20 and facing lv68 enemies or whatever it was. it was absurd. 
---
The mid game was horrid before one wasteland, the moment you move into savage divide the game was shit for me, the enemies ranged from 5 to 68 and I found that absurd. I was afraid of exploring because I didn't know what to expect, now I know.
---
I enjoyed leveling so much after one wasteland and it was so much faster that I can't even begin to compare, I knew exactly what level enemies I'd be finding. my level. I never struggled and I didn't have a lv500 character funding me, I was working with what I had, which wasn't much. I don't even have friends to help me transfer. 
---
At the moment, my new character is level 64 and I am using pretty basic gear, I spent about 10k caps to get some gear, a 1 star legendary weapon and I'm doing absolutely fine. 
---
I understand some people may be struggling... I just don't see how it can be enough to warrant all this complaining.
---
That some glitch? I've never seen a scortchbeast inside valley galleria plus it's a separate cell so not sure how that would inside ( glass caverns should be the only in game instanced with scortchbeast ).
---
You have saved me an exorbitant amount of plastic, thank you :)
---
I have been researching and I like the system. I was merely sad that it now feels like I got punished for making a new character halfway through; I have a level 170 and a level 136, and now I wish I had just spent the time on 1 character and gotten to level 300 on that character instead.
---
I come out with more shotgun shells than I started with.
---
Shock pad gauntlets?
---
Huh weird, I'm on PC so I have not seen that once yet and daily ops is all I have been doing since I level up so much every time even at 140.
---
Burst fire with the .50 and minigun is a must to reduce wasteful ammo consumption
---
So you mean you didn't want to mill a 64th of an inch off your finger? You're no fun.
---
Is there a note? I checked the other day but I must be blind lol
---
this sub downvotes everything that isnt circlejerk, they downvote fuckin bug reports.
---
the problem is that this "community" or rather this subreddit, has gotten to the point where every critical piece of feedback, every bug report, every opinion that isnt fallout 76 good, gets labeled "bitching"
---
some people are just insecure about the fact they like a game thats not well regarded and to this day has a litany of inexcusable issues, so they over-correct or take these shitty "it doesnt happen to me so it doesnt matter" positions.
---
I got a 2 shot explosive gatling gun from the purveyor, and it's my main weapon for normal battles
---
39. 2 daughters, 4 &amp; 16m. Going to bed now at 2am on the couch. Getting up in 5 hours to watch Frozen again.
---
Do the daily ops, guaranteed legendary every time
---
At full health I have 400, with deep pocketed Ss armor, bear arms, marsupial, class freak, and 14 STr. Hardly carrying any chems or food, and stims, Rad away, and radx are kept at 15 per. I used to carry hundreds of each but thats useless. Especially with a vampires weapon. 
---
The ss armor keeps protected from attacks and rads, survival sryanige keep me feed and quenched. The best part is I can actually use the Chinese stealth armor and pa without being overweight. If I want I can't take rads with this and have even more carry weight. But ehhh
---
it's all RNG, just gotta grind my dude
---
Yup noticed this as well, good tip
---
Does anyone know if other variants can be obtained through the purveyor?
---
When I start up the game, I look at the scoreboard and this doesn't happen to me anymore.
---
Halloween didn't fit into their current 'season' and therefore won't bother.
---
Brthesda hasn't even come close to breaking even on FO76 and until they do, dont expect anything but money making tactics in their 'new content' drops.  
---
Then, once they break even or feel they are getting no more mileage out of the current game, will abandon it with excuses like, 'but we want ES6 and Starfield to be amazing!' and pretend they haven't had over a decade on both games and still not much is known beyond the fact they are being made.
---
This reminds me of the internet.  Before companies knew how to market and monopolize it, there was a brief time where, if lucky enough to be my age (37) you recall that day where Google ACTUALLY worked and wasn't just really well hidden ad re-directs and scripts made so unrelated, but well marketed shit hits higher than relevant matches.
---
Now games are 3 generations in and while indie devs will always have gems and create tomorrow's next Activision or Capcom, the people at the helm of most game companies are more into maximizing profit rather than making good games.  Sadly experiments like FO76 only further push this outcome as i think it was a great idea, poor execution, but its commercial underperformance will likely fuel more BS plans like 'what if we made Skyrim again, but with better water effects and a special edition sword if they pay the extra 10 bucks?'
---
Lol
---
Wow that's awesome! These camps are amazing I love randomly seeing them it just make me laugh. I never would make one myself since that isn't my style but good for the people who make these! 
---
A few months back on PC I ran into a small shack in white springs with a massive sign saying " Dick cheney made money off the iraq war" I was on the floor since that was the last thing I expected to run into after a queen fight.
---
Today’s challenge was super easy, got elder with one other player
---
God no. so many people would just bitch about having to play NW for rewards like they already do on the normal NW dailies. And yes I do actually play NW.
---
A Bloodied Gauss?
---
There are a few locations that seem to spawn the most legendary enemies: West Tek, Whitespring Golf Club and cottages, Huntersville being the first that come to mind. 
---
Here are some other ways to get them:
---
- Daily Ops as you mentioned 
---
- The Ally in your camp gives a daily which frequently gives a legendary reward
---
- Do the SBQ event. You will get one as a reward for participating and if you get enough damage on the queen you get another
---
- Look for Horde events around the map. Always one legendary and if you search this sub you will see some guides from people who have nuanced many more out of one event
---
- Do One Violent Night, always a legendary at the end and sometimes 2-4 others
---
- I’m sure you’ve done Uranium Fever.
---
Yep it does almost double the damage of a bloodied gauss now
---
anything robotic, resilient, and in the burrows.
---
this, people on this subreddit take the "if it doesnt happen to me, it doesnt matter" position all the time. they only think about their build or experience, they want everyone to play how they deem acceptable, and if you dont like it, you arent allowed to give feedback, because thats complaining and thats not allowed in candyland76
---
For me, if I join one and the players are already in I take a look at the progress.
---
If they are at 9 minutes and not done the first uplink, I leave until they finish and then rejoin.
---
I’m here for elder rewards not ammo farming
---
this is why reddit is the ultimate circlejerk place and 4chan called it ages ago
---
I played daily ops earlier today and finished at 8:01 so I figured that I'd try again and still didnt finish in time cause the op glitched and wouldnt spawn the last group of enemies for a few seconds but at the end screen it said I had already unlocked elder rank. I didnt receive any rare rewards though. So am I just out of luck today?
---
Will do, thanks for your help!
---
Spot on.  The irony is that the mere making of this article/post type makes the person a defacto hypocrite.
---
Yeah I was unsure if I should use that. Now that ive rejigged some stuff I came out with 3 strength so I went for that instead of bandolier. Thanks for your help!
---
You’re missing a negative attitude. XD jk. Seriously though, I love the new update. Idk why people are so upset. Honestly I don’t agree with many posts about how awful the update is but I don’t pick fights. Opinions are opinions. I’m glad you’re not hating it! And I hope it stays that way :)
---
The way they handle the caps economy is actually one of the more solid parts of the game. Caps still have value, that’s hard to pull off. If you raise cap limits you are just pricing out the market for artificial inflation that’s harder to grind for
---
Good.
---
I wish making a daily ops team would instantly grant the bond with other players. Most teams I make, people join right away and we start the daily op immediately
---
Fuck I’m in the same boat, reset it 5 times and surge never has they key, I’m on ps4
---
settler rep unarmed weapon
---
The first time you've been back to the Nukashine in a year. 
---
"I'm so glad you're here"
---
I have those serums in my vendor. My psn is TracerBullet53
---
So the event would be held near the mountainous lake region of the Savage Divide, where an abandoned mine would be found. This mine however, is now home to a hive of honeybeasts. Unlike normal honeybeasts, some of them would simply look like giant bees since they are not the ones burdening a hive on their back. You can explore some parts of the mine, but you can’t enter the hive itself. In order to make enter the hive, you must make the colony try and evacuate the hive due to them believing it’s under attack.
---
The first way I imagine it could go is that the Queen Honeybeast in an attempt to flee the hive, will get in a fight with the players since there appears to be no threat other than them. Her flying is more restricted, but new variants of honeybeasts will be flying around, including: 
---
The Honeybeast Gaurd, which is will be appearing as a honeybeast with chitin on it.
---
The Workers, which is a smaller than normal honeybeast but can fly at a low height and dive to sting.
---
The Excavator Honeybeast, using its strong jaws to stagger players.
---
The Royal Gaurds, which come in at the second phase of the battle, being similar to the Guard but this time having more chitin and being slightly bigger. 
---
These enemies will act as cannon fodder for the Queen. The Queen will also spawn larvae which will explode upon being stepped on. She does something similar to the Scorchbeast Queen, which will be the crop dusting when she flies. However, she will instead crop dust in circles making it more concentrated and slightly more deadly. 
---
Once she is slain, you can then enter the hive and loot it for materials such as honey, royal honey, larvae, and other misc. junk. Perhaps a new weapon that can potentially drop is a stinger gauntlet, which will be a honeybeast stinger attached to a gauntlet, being able to inflict poison damaged to enemies.
---
What do you guys think.
---
yeah there was review bombing, but there was also counter jerk too.
---
but for the most part, user reviews on places like steam are worth about fuckall because of shit like bombing and counter bombing.
---
I agree, and I did.
---
How is AA or Vampire on a Gauss mini?
---
I havent noticed too much of a dropoff with my BE 50 cal. I was worried, but I have no complaints so far. And Ive fought in Scorched Earth, Colossal Problem, Radiation Rumble and a few other bullet soakers as well with no complaints from me.
---
Dont get me wrong, the nerf is noticeable but its not bad to the point where I have to scrap my build like I had to with my TSE Shotgun when TSE was nerfed.
---
That works too, I’m more of a deep pocketed, whatever-the-armor-weight-perk is kind of guy though
---
Yeah I think the link messed up for some reason but ive posted a new one, with some of the suggested changes and using all my points. Your edits super helpful, Ill make sure to keep that stuff in mind. I take it those perks should be swapped in and out whenever needed like lockpick? Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it.
---
Yeah but a lot of people don’t pay attention to that, or the other 3 players spamming the follow me emote
---
Their very own ESO where they copied the concept (and the name) of this patch has this but of course they didn't copy that with it.
---
I support the gays and their right to kill you without mercy.
---
Whatever you do, don't blink!
---
I kept a lot of mine too, it’s a nice decoration if nothing else
---
wasnt calling you out, specifically.
---
I’m still 39 and can’t even get anywhere without getting my ammo drained on the most pathetic things (I got this game to keep my cousin company and play with him when he gets off work but he ditched me🙃)
---
That's fuckin awful, did anyone report that stupidass?
---
My SS has weapon, junk and ammo weight reduction, chemist backpack with Bandolier and Packrat perks. I'm only 260 weight however I can stash and stash and am rarely over encumbered as all junk, ammo and chems are 90% lighter.
---
If they implement mole miners into the mix, I want to see a mole miner that's as tall as us and wields a fatman
---
Mannequins are just one of the random encounters, I'm guessing your camp is on top of an area in which these things spawn
---
Nice! Gotta say I am a bit jealous--the more comments I see, the more I think it might just be a PS4-centric thing.
---
Keep kicking butt out there!
---
what is AA again?
---
Might be worth **telling** the rest of the team that's what you're doing, in that case.  :)
---
What the fuck
---
Anti Armor
---
This was the first one
---
Yes exactly.
---
there should be a thing on the page for it that says how long ago it was started and how many ppl are in it like every other event 
---
and fix the no progress bug ofc
---
Its fun and janky and needs new maps
---
I agree there is too much complaining, but it is kinda a shit game (I still love it though, not as much as NV, 3 or even 4, but I love it)
---
Maybe. Depends on how much you can get done in those 3 days.
---
So you can stay with your friends in that particular session, maybe. Absolutely annoying when playing solo, though.
---
Also, if you decide to stay, your camp will be there safe and sound upon finding a proper server.
---
You didn’t need to go online to tell anyone you were quitting the game. That’s just negative attention-seeking behavior. Just quit. You don’t have to dump your problems on everyone else in the process.
---
I think it’s the order of how their program works, it connects and loads the character... they would need to check availability of camp sight, which is deeper in the code base operations of loading..  like the camp location doesn’t load until After the load screen.  It would be difficult to load the camp first without already assigning a player a world and that would take longer to load the game initially.  Possibly could cause server problems for each time the game opened...
---
I just finished the daily op and wanted to add this. If you are the leader and get a full team, start the daily op soon. I was in a team that had two leaders that dropped after 5 minutes each,  leaving me as leader. After we were stuck at 3, I went into the op and only had one join me and one stayed out. 
---
Also remember if your team does finish and you're the leader you can change the team to another type.
---
I think it's just people arent in a rush to complete the dailies now, like logging in right as the change happens(which from my understanding is how the glitch happened)
---
jesus loves you, but everyone else thinks you're an asshole. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS1AiVM1ks8
---
You can also just use the Perk Loadout Manager mod from Nexusmods.com
---
Cause you know, social distancing it’s corona time
---
Not currently. Perhaps in the future.
---
nope.
---
For what it's worth, the event's been significantly improved w better odds for everything, lower prices for pails, and no regional exclusivity.
---
The scorched event is in the calendar.
---
OMG!!! Same thing happened to me a couple nights ago. I’m used to using v.a.t.s manually....Couldn’t figure out why I kept aiming at their legs. I was cycling through the limbs when I thought I was cycling targets. I hate gun fu...Really fucks you up if you’re not used to it
---
I totally feel this as I am upset with learning about this :( Hoped that each weapon was able to specifically roll different prefixes and effects well shux better pray to RNG for the Warglaive because that sounds like the best thing to get
---
Yup, I took Gun Fu out because of this.
---
Turn Pacifist on. 
---
And there’s no need for homophobic slurs.
---
Lead isn't my issue, its the steel. I am constantly scrapping anything steel I can find. :/
---
3rd person is just janky in general. Like trying to use a sniper scope and it doesnt zoom in where your reticle was aimed at. Which can be annoying in nuclear Winter since switching back to 1st person doesn't always work when you press the button.
---
Ya RUDE
---
I know
---
Yeah I started playing destiny 2 more and more once I completed season 1.
---
AND
---
  
---
If there are two Daily Ops groups with 1-2 people each, someone disband and join the other to get 3-4 people in ONE group FFS.
---
There's nothing to say that anywhere in the ESM, or in their communications.
---
My hands are already a patchwork of scars and warped finger nails thank you very much.
---
You need a Colossus Sac
---
Share Mysterious Stranger and watch your team mates run up to get a good look at him while acting all confused.
---
On PC I have ran into the timer not moving if someone jumps in after the first point is pressed. So I will rarely join an "in progress" OP unless I can communicate via mic with the team to confirm the OP is starting. When no one but me has a mic I personally prefer to wait untill I can see the team and we all go in together. An OP takes me 6 to 7 minutes solo anyway.
---
This. I like this.
---
instigating or bloodied, maybe anti armor.
---
I run my level 285 beserkers junkies hybrid build through the daily ops with the rest of my team and she doesn't die, I wouldn't try it solo using her though. I do agree that having your build and gear sorted does make it alot easier, i was able to solo it myself on my tank melee build just under 8 mins.
---
Awesome, I can definitely agree with that! I'll hold out for an antiarmor for when the RNG is in my favor again, and I'll stick with the furious for now.
---
I've honestly only ever used Ex weapons with faster fire, a handmade and a Tesla. The FFR definitely makes or breaks those weapons in pvp. Before the Ex damage bonus kicks in that extra dps provides enough constant damage that most people can't heal through it completely and it just eats through people after the boost. Idk if it's working as intended or if it's just spikes of "magic". I've never looked into the numbers really but I've surprised multiple people with it so it's got definite niche uses. 
---
That's the only time I use either of those guns though unfortunately. I don't even pull em out unless I'm grabbing pvp gear.
---
Furious I've rolled lots of over time with lots of different affects. I don't mind it compared to other possible rolls but unless your conciously focus firing one enemy at a time then you're basically using a non legendary weapons until the buff stacks enough to be useful. You're also using a non legendary until the Executioner affect procs. 
---
Out of your choices though.... I'd probably use the Furious for solo pve but if you play with a group and really don't use VATS the Executioners affect might be more useful with it's larger buff and the time until buff reduced by teammates damaging enemies.
---
I recomend farming xp. Its more fun and you will still get all season rewards
---
If you're spending more ammo on ops than public events, you aren't playing efficient. Use prime weapons, adrenaline, and concentrated fire and you should be fine
---
Idk maybe op against the queen since apparently crippling the queen is back
---
Lol uggh could you image 4 useless strangers appearing at once?
---
This more due to One Wasteland, not the nerf
---
I prefer ultra light because it reduces the weight when not equipped so I can have a couple sets that I swap between.
---
Yep!
---
That’s just the power of foosball, the game haunts you, stays with you.
---
If Season 1 taught me anything, it's that I don't actually need to do any grinding. My normal gameplay will get me to the end with plenty of time to spare. 😋 Fuck those NW challenges though, they can rot.
---
*laughs in levitating trashcan*
---
Yeah! It’s an awesome outfit.
---
haha
---
I didn’t think I had OCD until I read that and was like “man, gotta roll for that last 3 star”.   :)
---
4 at once might actually kill something lol.
---
I like that feature. Because when I jump servers I also stay where I can't place my camp if the map is "good" or if I'm just shopping.
---
But yeah, there could be an option like "only join camp available maps" or something.
---
Better than my 4 days, 1 reward, all 4 elder... I got a stash box
---
Thanks, I guess I'll max out ammo next. Level 3 of rads, I take no damage. It's awesome.
---
So majestic
---
Wait until you get the bloatflies and huge piles of bat guano in the middle of your camp.
---
Well, you take damage but no longer need radaway.
---
How long is this season? I don't see anyone like Zorbo to race against.
---
I play like 20-30 minutes and I always get every single score thing done. I find them easier now.
---
That is the core issue people complain about. Builds aren't "ruined" they just take a few more shots then before.  Enemies aren't harder you just can't one shot them as easily.
---
Bloodied and AA have been my thing. I always wanted to try Vampire but could never get anything good thats Vampire.
---
Except the glaive ( and it’s plan) are character bound! And you can’t even craft legendary versions of it! It’s basically random chance from Mmurgh’s mystery picks, or reward quests that pull from that list... but basically it seems like the rareness of a Fixer, except without the inherent legendary bonuses, and character bound. It’s terrible.
---
Don't trust the maths here. They don't usually do it well.
---
Fair, certainly a good idea to have a troubleshooter set
---
I don't have FO1st and have no problem doing farm runs. I really don't get that part of your reply.
---
Simply wanting to play other games I understand.
---
Did that a few times, still wouldnt work :(
---
yes, however like all mutations they can be removed by using radaway or a decontamination shower. if you want to protect them you need starched genes. but they will last forever until you remove them.
---
Im pretty sure you still need starched genes or they will go away
---
Because people are lazy
---
You need starched genes.
---
Lmao I change oil for a living
---
Yes I cant stand gun fu , I can manually change targets a 100x faster than this perks lets you all it does is make me accidentally change body part targets.
---
I haven’t seen any recently. But if you kill them before they explode. They always dropped one for me.
---
I’ve had this issue for months, even after not doing retirement plan for days it still would show as completed in the pip boy
---
Eso doesn’t have a global trade market so that a no , I like eso guild store system and I like fo76 barter economy system lol
---
Guarantee Gearset from daily op and area drop , public events and make the legendary effect the RNG . Shit even 8+ player  world bosses
---
Vamp makes you immortal as long as you have ammo
---
Yeah, but, I'm not really leaning as heavily on it as I was before.
---
I think it's pretty clear from Season 1 that there's a lot more wiggle room than we expected there would be when it started.  We already know about the planned Double SCORE and Bonus Dailies in advance now.  As long as you do the Dailies/Weeklies, you're going to make it with two weeks to spare.  Any Repeatable XP Weeklies are kind of a bonus, and XP is generally more plentiful, from a wider array of sources, so you're not condemned to run West Tek over and over again.
---
My only thing is that it really bugs me that the Greenhouse stuff, which is something that's been asked for from practically day 1, is not only a one-time season reward, but stuck at the very end of the board.  And it sucks that, compared to Captain Cosmos, this board is exceptionally weak when it comes to stuff I actually want leading up to it.  Not that the Ghillie stuff was that great, but it did have some versatility to it.  The Commie stuff has no appeal to me, and the Armor Ace stuff is wasted on being Power Armor exclusives.  Spaces awarding 5 RadAway/Rad-X?  Nuka-Shine?  Stimpaks?  A half-dozen low-res icons?  Are they for real about this?
---
Truly. God's creations are endless and magnificent! OH, mean Mothman's creations!
---
Yeah it seems really off compared to 5mm, my heavy machine gun is sad
---
My hypothesis is that it's something related to how hunting rifles can be modded to use .50 ammo, so it's using the same drop amount as .308 because of that 
---
I can't think of any other guns besides heavies and hunting rifles that even use the ammo, maybe pipe guns? I have no clue
---
Same. When ops dropped I was hovering around 1900 shells, with 1500 spare in stash. I'm currently carrying 3500+ and there's no way in hell my stash can take anymore without sacrificing junk space I keep for excess resources. Might have to start dumping a few 1000 rounds every now and again.
---
Don’t worry too much about it. It’s all good. Be safe dude!
---
This is so true. I can solo any without issue but I come in at 8 min and about 30 sec every time. I just need a body to cover the 2x multiple times
---
Sound good
---
Do you have a link to that CDPR post? I’m curious to see what people are saying about the company and what finally burnt up the god status they held among the community
---
Jak se mas!
---
A water and mutated reptile filled bunker sounds like fun.
---
I have one piece of armor with different weight reductions for each. Weapons, armor, ammo and have the chem backpack
---
I find the perk kinda helps keep track of enemies instead of randomly just shutting vats off if you lose direct line of sight for literally half a second 
---
Do you guys not have that same problem or am I doing something wrong lol? 
---
I thought the perk was pretty good cuz of that
---
You can glitch through any door or fence or wall including the one on the basement with the power armour glitch
---
I had this same problem check the other named enemy the guy with power armor. For some reason he had the key when I did it and his body disappeared. I had to keep loading back in till his body showed up.
---
They updated their [roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4kRrC6daJSw0g4s5KpHdAS/48e7143814678898dcbd77dfdfbd389e/Fallout76_Season2_CommunityCalendar-EN-05.jpg) Thursday. No mention of any future NW updates  👎
---
I agree.....but I am a little tired of the bugs that are still present and really shouldn't be.  
---
Why does my gun still automatically reload when I still have ammo in the clip/chamber?
---
They already have it. Robots in the burrows.
---
builds are an essential part of the game though. i don’t use a legendary weapon just my normal short gatling that they finally fixed so i can get mods lol. i wear x-01 without any mods cause i play solo and hate launching nukes. there’s still a lot of fun to be had in the game with a solid build. hopefully bethesda makes a patch to find a middle ground for casual players without doing too much to the new update cause i love it. it’s much easier getting xp now which allows for faster build changes
---
Tested with a friend, once I press join, my camp will appeared in the world. Much earlier than my character enters the world. The server should have detected whether the camp could be placed...
---
It’s a perfectly fine perk of you are accustomed to playing with it. Not my style personally so being forced to use it= rude
---
God. You're simping so hard for Todd Howard and it's really quite pathetic. Bethesda has sickening issues. They lie. They seem to not really give a shit at all about this dumpster fire of a game. Get over yourself.
---
You liked Fallout 3/2/1/nv/4/ES and just can't give up on the franchise I get it. But flopping around like this is really quite sad.
---
Fuck your PSA and your shilling for Bethesda. We pay their salaries.
---
Sorry buddie i didnt want to hurt anyones feelings sorry again wrong word i used
---
The power armor guy is behind the locked door.
---
Yes it is at first when I got my explosive ammo one I love it
---
I am pretty sure that " leader of the pack" will give you a legendary when you kill the alpha. I say pretty sure, because I don't know if the update changed it.
---
I recommand you to use Tenderizer rank 1 instead of 3. 
---
For one perk point, you can get a dmg bonus of 5% ( Tenderizer Rank 1 ). But after...each perk point add a dmg bonus of only 1% ( Tenderizer Rank 2 and 3 ).
---
Add "Silencer" rank 2 instead.
---
Tenderizer Rank1 and Silencer Rank 2.
---
But honestly you may wanna watch some Commando build videos on Youtube. It will at least show you the importance of some perk cards you may not really think about.
---
The Shock Pads are a mod for the Gauntlet.  The Gauntlet is the actual weapon.
---
The best Gauntlet rolls are similar to any other melee weapon, really.  You probably want Bloodied/Instigating/Junkies/Anti-Armor with Swing Speed, or the combo of 40% Power Attack Damage/40% Damage Reduction While Power Attacking.
---
I am
---
I still don’t get people who use reddit before even attempting google
---
You are indeed not forced to pay :)
---
That's right near where my camp is and those mannequins have always been there. If you don't know about it, go up that hill toward the Blood Eagle camp and right before you get to the camp there's a hole in the cliff to explore. Bring a gun.
---
Hit elder every day since it started all I got was v94 stash, solar panel,v94 stadh,stash, stash. The rng is brutal
---
Really?  I've never seen it in vending machines if its that cheap.  But other stuff like Grognak's Axes and Standing Gorillas are common.
---
Solid points. I'm pretty sure thats different people complaining about different things, though. Not a group of people alltogether complaining about everything you listed.
---
The perk makes 2mm not a chore to craft.
---
Doesn't seem to heal the unamed NPCs since I see the health bar decrease when it use it with Friendly Fire.
---
I have no idea what that demand for 200 extra weight has to do with the current situation, only if it's actually happening, that is
---
Damn, did you even try approaching the overseers house woth your camera equipped and out?
---
This isn’t a glitch its a feature of the One Wasteland For All Update, Enemies now scale to each individual persons level (up to a limit depending on area difficulty) so a level 200 player would see the same scorched as you but it would be level 50 for them
---
A lot is hight level players, I would think its something your friends are doing or not doing as im only level 36 and I find it a bit more challenging but not to the stage that its unplayable like a lot of people are saying. I dont seem to be taking much more damage and jt not taking that much longer to kill things. In fact I struggled more before the update when I didn't have a set build and just used whatever, now I've start making a build everything has become easier.
---
Stop skipping leg day
---
Its just the build jocks moaning
---
I think they mean 200 separate weight for vendor items I guess
---
Speak for yourself. Bethesda has fallen
---
Do berry mentats work for the cloaked enemies?
---
&gt;You see, though, as someone who has never played NV it is completely irrelevant to me. 
---
I mean you are literally complaining about a buggy game, buggy launch and the game being nothing but an asset rip off. There is precedent for that and if you have played it or not is irrelevant. 76 doesn't tread any new ground in this subject and yet if you ask random people on the internet and even more so with certain subreddits people will do nothing but praise the game. Not giving  a shit about the buggy as fuck launch or the fact it is mostly assets ripped right from FO3. 
---
This isn't a whataboutism this is literally pointing out a previous example that you even defended as acceptable. And this entire complaint is like claiming that Mc Donalds inferior to Burger King because of how they wrap their hamburgers. It is a weak petty argument that doesn't actually mean anything and is just pointless fucking nitpicking that has all the bite force of a dead parrot.
---
&gt; The point I'm making is that 76 was made with as little effort as  possible in order to make as much profit as possible with zero regard  for the players.  
---
Vague arguments like this could apply to every game that is ever been created. 
---
&gt; Every step of the way it has cut corners and often makes the situation worse when trying to fix things. 
---
Can you prove corners were cut? Or are you just assuming because issues came up that they must be cutting corners? Because I have fucked up many a meal while following the instructions as close as I can while still making mistakes and ruining the food.
---
&gt; The game is designed to milk the fan base while they 'develop' a MTX  strategy and always-online format for future games. 
---
Then they are doing a terrible job because I haven't really paid into the game more then the purchase price. I did one time pay 10 dollars in but that is about it beyond the initial price I bought it 2 years ago.  Rather ironically PLAYERS not Bethesda has convinced each other they need useless shit.  I've seen a lot of people acting like the junk stash is some how necessary which it isn't. That survival camps are needed for teleporting which they aren't.  That the only way to repair items with with repair kits which just isn't true.  
---
And the most amusing thing is when I point this stuff out I get told I'm wrong and down voted for it. 
---
Can you prove future games will have this same set up? Or is this the usual bullshit were people just pull shit out of their ass and present it as fact because it is Bethesda. But then get upset when I use that same line of logic to say they have sexual relationship with animals and all sorts of other purposefully insulting things that I have no proof of but I just pull out of my ass to prove a point?
---
It's absolute s*** that it was not clearly spelled out that the Legendary Charisma does not allow perk sharing. Since the legendary coins are not refundable, I'm stuck with a leveled up charisma card that does not meet the need. Bethesda, your support sucks on this.
---
Never used Gun Fu. VATS with Concentrated Fire is great though. Headshots and more importantly combat inhibitors.
---
No problem, just was curious 
---
I usually share tenderizer or blocker lately anyway, occasionally cannibal if I wanna go for the subtle troll haha
---
Things to not share; gun fu, rad sponge, born survivor
---
Just hit lv 31. Use shotguns and melee, scrap all the weapons you can for mods/steel, fully auto pipes can be used as backups as well. Kill scorched for shotgun shells, run morgantown high school for plastic, run weight rooms at flatwoods/charleston for lead, super mutants for gunpowder. Gunpowder is also really easy to craft from abundant cloth resources found everywhere(mainly pre-war money), just keep an eye out for acid(insect parts/cryptids/abraxo/batteries etc) or put your base on the acid seep in the far north area of the forest. Turn on component view too, lead and acid are in stuff you might not expect. Most toys contain lead in addition to plastic, for example.
---
Usually tho, if you get close (95%) and vats with a shotgun, you will kill them with 2 shots or less, and they will drop 5 or 6 shells(mole miners and scorched use shotguns a lot). 1 if you can find a 3 star armour piece with the reduce dmg while blocking tag. Use that piece of armour until you find a better one. 
---
My character only has 1 shotgun dmg perk card, but has 1 reduced blocking piece of armour and a 1star quad pump shotgun(woo campfire tales). It would still work without the legendary equipment however, I ran a stock double barrel/pump shotgun initially, but the eq does make me more efficient.
---
I think I need a game mentor like you lol. For context, I'm a casual player since school started up again, so maybe once a week depending on homework. I played fairly often over break and I'm only level 32. I've played a couple times since the update and it just isn't fun for me anymore. Honestly I'm just waiting for the new Watchdogs to come out now.
---
I’m level 83 and am having no troubles, yeah enemies are slightly harder but the game is more enjoyable now, more interesting.
---
Every hour, on the hour.
---
Actually, that sounds like a plan...
---
You are not really being efficient. Find a better 50 cal and adjust your build. 
---
Also, remember: you don't need to kill everyone. 
---
I am not a heavy gunner, but I tried the Ops with a Vampire 50 cal, plus three levels of heavy gunner and antiarmor benefits + bloody mess. 
---
I took 500 rounds to go in and exited with 700.
---
PS4?
---
yes.
---
&gt; Now I dont mean any disrespect by this, but what is it about Halloween that makes you Americans go so crazy?
---
In the US it's super fun, and many people just like it thematically.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
I honestly didn't even know this could be a thing
---
I never thought of Daily Ops as the same thing as those instanced group interiors, but in hindsight I guess that makes sense
---
Well by global trade system, I more so meant like a hub. Basically, it would be a place where a player could go, to place their item up for trade. For example, I put up my max level J/E/90/ Combat rifle, and in exchange I would trade it for B/SS/S/ Pole hook. I would leave my weapon at the hub, until a players shows up that’s willing to trade the item that I want. The game alerts me when the trade is complete and I pick up my new weapon. It would give other players options. Especially those who don’t like third party trading hubs. 
---
World bosses would be awesome in this game!
---
Oh that's sounds pretty handy but I'm sadly a heavy build
---
3000 rounds?!? I'm starting to understand that legendary ammo smith perk.
---
I didn’t know if this was a bug or a “feature”.
---
I can never tell anymore haha.
---
Man I might just have to run it 24/7 then
---
I want my best friend Biv in my camp.
---
A huge robot with a magnetic pulse that draws everyone in and does an AOE melee saw blade spin attack. 
---
Multiple types of gun damage. Missiles, mini nukes, flame throwers, laser, etc. Each weapon individually targeting people at random. Weapons can be targeted in VATS to be temporarily disabled.
---
The mutation has a problem firing. There's even a dev note on the effect script talking snout how it's set to keep refiring because it fails so much
---
Being bloodied I can only take about 1-2
---
Weight isn't an issue.  
---
Also, depending on which version of the bug is going on now, items in your vendor are still vulnerable to being bought for next to nothing.  Items in your vendors, stash, displays, and even on your person have been 'stolen' if you believe every report that's come in the last few days.
---
You think better than PA with the perks you get for using it?
---
Probably not higher level but most likely more stars. That would be awesome to have another minor effect.
---
I enter the ops with 300 shells. I sell everything else. And I am usually walking out with 750-800 if the events ends quickly, twice that amount if I farm it longer. 
---
But it all started with Earl and his wendigos. It's raining shells, aleluya.
---
What a hypocritical mess this was to read
---
Just leave the group if you're done, or if you're leader then change the group goal
---
If you leave, then the new players get ownership of the group, and players that join them will be able to help them in the middle of their daily op
---
1 player joining after the 5 minute mark is what made the difference in me getting elder status yesterday
---
K thx
---
Yea unfortunately you may get assholes doing this now
---
And the extra perks for using heavies with PA. I suppose im bout to 24/7 us PA
---
3 runs for me....and 3 burrows sign sets.
---
Spam run them using a different weapon. At the very last boss swap to your .50 cal and you will get around 200 rounds for it without using any. Do this a few times and you'll be set for awhile.
---
434
---
:(
---
Guess if you wanna be safe you gotta start your own group 
---
I usually get people joining pretty quickly after making a public ops group since it's the new thing and all, so for the moment that's nice
---
We want these rare items. The easier you make it to get, the less exciting all these rewards are, and the less value they have. Being able to have something very few have makes it rare. There will always be a tier of items that are rare. The reason you don’t want common items is because they aren’t rare. If everyone could get everything this game would be so fucking boring
---
Put it him in a body bag, Jhonny! Yeah!
---
Bloodied builds still have high enough DPS not to be bothered. Rifleman struggles a lot if not bloody.
---
Now the question is was there always a random encounter spawn there or did this new patch move some around
---
Hope not. Most of us are not even halfway through farming for their build even with all those dupes. Having to start from scratch is gonna be a nightmare. Maybe they can come up with a module or something that you can apply onto your gears to make it 4 star. It would have to be real grindy tho
---
Hahaha so it looks like 90% of the food builds need to start looking for another game
---
Yeah 4 star weapons would be cool.  With all the nerfing going on they have room for higher powered weapons.
---
As a long time lover of my firing speed vampire laser gatling, that sounds like one tasty weapon roll
---
I'm sorry for your loss
---
Probably thought you get better rewards if you win "solo". News flash - you don't.
---
What a dumbass
---
The bitching wouldn't be as much of a pain if people could actually listen to the counter arguments and learn something instead of just dismissing them.  I wish there was a thread like the current list of banned "Bethesda Plz" topics that actually explained the shit that people complain about over and over and over.
---
I've lost track of how many times someone complains about stash space and I've tried to explain the limitations on the servers sending inventory data, or that camp budgets are due to processing limitations, or that Bethesda didn't invent daily caps and they're a staple in the live service games market in order to maintain player retention, or that people can't just expect to buy everything they want with free atoms because live service games need to make money and buying cosmetics with cash was one of the first things they announced about this game and so on and so on and so on with the same crap.
---
That and when people decide to make a mountain out of every fucking molehill, there must have been at least a dozen threads yesterday about how Bethesda is going to ruin Halloween by not planning another Mischief Night rerun.
---
I could swear someone asked about the ammo the Perfect Storm used on the datamining Discord very recently.  This was probably why.  This weapon might be bugged.
---
I run Excavator PA with Calibrated shocks and +STR Torso mod + my mutations and Strong Back I have 511 CW while in a public team with at least 1 person
---
This is correct. I can solo the event and keep you alive. But I need your emotional support. If you can cast a shadow over the uplink, we are good.
---
Not everyone has the same experience as you. I've gotten 3 new friends into the game since the update, and they are having no issue whatsoever. They're having a blast, building their camps, exploring, and no one is having any issues defeating any enemies.  
---
I'm definitely not dismissive of critcism, in fact I've criticized the daily ops quite a bit as I think they were far too short of a thing to keep people interested for any decent amount of time daily.  
---
However thinking people are dismissing something because they had the same issues and are ignoring them is also wrong.
---
But is it all done through the vending machine, or do displays need to be stored as well?
---
Do you ever just sell any? That is kind of crazy.
---
Using Semi Rifles currently, love my Rifleman character a lot
---
I almost never use PA. I think all PAs are really weak in this game.
---
I've gotten nothing twice. All I really wanted was the symptomatic and I got it day two so I'm not really stressing the rewards anymore.
---
So once you reach the top tier the first time on a character for the day, is that it as far as rare rewards go for that character? Or does replaying after that still give a chance for rare rewards?
---
That sounds really sexy.
---
Indeed. As a PA Heavy tabling, I’m super happy with maxed Ammo Factory, Ammosmith, and Super Duper.
---
People were saying the same thing about the mask from ACP. 
---
Still don’t have a mask.
---
I definitely think there needs to be more boss enemies. I also think they need to be tougher, despite the changes, we did SBQ yesterday and she literally came out of the ground, then died before she even got to fly anywhere with 5-6 people there.
---
r/PKOA for all those who are struggling with the new patch. For all you new players who want to play, but can’t seem to make it. We are here to help. I’m not sure about all of the platforms, but the PS4 community is strong and willing to help.
---
You'll have every reward in about 2 weeks. This would be so redundant because there are very few rewards.
---
To be honest, they're way too easy to get. They will all be worthless and sold in bulk in vendors by the end of the month.
---
It’s not a temporary event, it’s been 4 days. What online rpg game in the world just hands you the loot?
---
And what effects does this have on the rifle? Any bugs, or properly functioning?
---
I don't know how you'd access anything through a display, but I don't know if displays act differently when only partially loaded so...maybe?  I didn't see any point in taking the chance, so I pulled everything.
---
Noted. Thank you
---
50 is the max player level but the enemies that are over 50 are still scaled to be able to be taken out by level 50 players 
---
The enemy levels just help gauge how much more of a threat some enemies are than others
---
Any levels over 50 are meant to help collect any missing perks you need, or perhaps re-allocate your stats if you want to try a different build 
---
Lately, levels have another purpose, they grant perk cards which can be scrapped for the new legendary perks 
---
If players continued to gain stats after 50, then it would be even more of a grind until you can begin to refine your build to your playstyle
---
Oh yeah. I can now reserve my resources and still make enough ammo to supply an army.
---
Nice luck, too bad you can trade the planXP
---
I am using the same vampire Tesla I used against the Gutsies, and it is overpowered. 
---
But I saw someone throwing molotovs all over the place while shooting a minigun to the burning victims. Quite effective. And cool as fuck.
---
This is actually a good idea. A dedicated super sniper would be epic.
---
Personally I'd rather grind for higher level weapons to make my rifle build work again, then drastically change my build and play style. I see your point though.
---
Still not fixed as of today.  Thanks Ra-Ra.  This is why I'm not having kids.
---
To each their own though. If you like PA and you feel it does well for you, use it. Not liking them is just my opinion.
---
Seems to only heal named npcs that are part of the events.
---
I agree with you that it's pulling hunting rifle numbers rather than heavy gun for the loot. 
---
I thought it was weird all these posts about coming out with more ammo until I used a gatling gun. 5mm drops at a rate for the minigun but gatling consumes a lot slower. 
---
It's the inverse for Gauss. Using my Gauss minigun I get a lot less ammo than I use but if you're a rifle or shotgun user you probably get the right amount. 
---
My guess is the code doesn't take into account the specific weapon rather just the type of ammo and then chooses a loot amount from that. Easier to code but ends up in these weird situations.
---
They were definately visible while firing for me today, sometimes they were visible while just standing still lol
---
So yeah there must be some bugs for sure
---
My b2525 isn't the same and there is no denying this but  I have just completed a daily op tonight by myself and while it wasn't easy I did complete it with my b2525 and I was glad. 
---
Anywho, I feel better now. Lol
---
Forest Urban cant mix. Matching means matching armour name. Combat forest urban leather trapper marine etc it has to be all one type.
---
All I gotta say is God. Bless. Jetpacks. Power armor or secret service. Used to be just a 'fun' but useless mod. Now. Oh now. Now BSRTBSRBTSBRTing up and out of a mob is a freaking lifesaver! Don't count that jetpack off anymore. It WILL save your bacon now!
---
Melee exists. I used unarmed weapons from level 0-360. Switched to ranged with the update, just for bosses...
---
I have done the event 20 times and so far, received four plans. Big reactor, Whistle, signs and jumpsuit. 
---
Not bad, but, you could sell them.
---
Right? I’m taking a bit more shots per kill, but it’s not even a dent in the new surplus of cores. Bit of carry weight issues, currently trying to move some points around for Batteries Included, but that’s an overall very minor complaint.
---
I think all the non-cononical, time line breaking stuff fits well into the 'cutting corners' category. How about that lever action reload problem from the last few games. Or, again, they didn't even bother removing the Prydwen from the stuff they copy pasted.    
---
I can prove all of this as well as you can disprove it.
---
Gun fu actually still works multiplicatively. Guess you like doing slap damage.
---
[Danse liked that]
---
Yea I have had that also happen
---
Sorry yes I forgot to add I do have rank 2 concentrated fire as well. It's nice for upping the hit chance and for target selection for sure but when AP runs out before the thing is dead it's only "ok".  You lose that "95%" to hit and any bonus damage. I'm not saying VATS is completely useless i'd just like to see some changes made to AP or AP usage calculations to factor in the increased hit requirements. Gun Fu was nice for the auto next target selection and 10, 20, and 30% damage bonuses for next 1, 2, and 3 targets.
---
No one says weight is the issue. It's bethesda not separating the vendor stock from your stash. Because they're not willing to part ways with 200 more weight.
---
There was 4 of us and we had good time before I got kicked
---
That's so frustrating. The least they can do is locate another world - even if it causes a longer loading screen.
---
I just make my own. There are always 1-2 peeps who join immediately , just wait unside the DO entrance for them to hop in
---
Yea thats what I did after and me and another guy did it in under 8 minutes easy
---
I've had to learn to do this when using the Fixer recently. Otherwise I end up burning through by ammo despite killings an enemy on the fifth bullet.
---
I think higher level players that don't like it will love it once they tune their builds. For the lower level players, Bethesda is going to have to figure that one out because when I was leveling back in July it was plenty hard. It takes time to figure out the perk system to a point where you feel comfortable with what you have and are able to at least keep up. Now being murdered by mole rats in your own CAMP is an issue.
---
Thanks. I think they should have a system to make claims where if you provide video proof you should be able to get either compensation(not atoms) or get the drop if you show proof
---
Bloodied Swing Speed Strength.
---
This is the best roll on every single melee weapon.
---
One work around I've found is try modding your gun to use ultracite ammo, I've noticed for the guns I've tried, I get alot more ammo than usual, especially at end screen
---
Obviously the problem is you won't be able to use the normal ammo anymore with that gun, so you could get in a bad situation if you don't check your remaining ammo before heading out again on non-daily ops content 
---
But hey, it's easy ammo, and typically a nice little damage boost to your gun if you do go for the daily ops ammo grind 
---
I uh haven't tried ultracite .50 yet though, it worked for my 2mm ultracite gauss gatling tho
---
I'm all for being a dick and doing dick moves in the unforgiving wasteland....but that's a dick move that Bethesda should condemn and prevent.
---
You are correct: sometimes they were shooting but not visible, but also, sometimes they were visible and not really attacking. Maybe it is lag, who knows. Like the extra second between the VATS headshot and the kill.
---
Lots of trips to the scrapper.
---
And he should send one every time you miss one of his dailies. So if you take a break from the game for two months, your mailbox will be filled with his emails...
---
At the very least maybe some scrip haha I agree
---
Not once have you explained your issue so idk what to listen to. But I'd love to hear it. I'm still trying to adjust too
---
Works fine for me, just like every gun i use during daily ops, once finished i use most of the 3 mins before being kicked out as a chance to run around collecting all ammo from enemy’s.
---
Have you tried any other weapons? My 10mm has been pretty consistent. Im not getting a sneak notification in vats, but it does the same damage in and out of vats.
---
Theres gotta be something screwy going on .
---
It's bugged. It's been reported. They probably won't fix it.
---
So if they lower your stash by 200 and give you 200 for vendors, you'd be OK with that?
---
Keep in mind, you have no idea at all what causes this bug, and having separate locations for your stuff may have no influence on things.
---
Anyway, you're the one suggesting 'give us the extra 200 weight', so you're making it part of the issue, when it's got nothing to do with it.
---
It’s because the rewards this season are better, they’re giving us minigames and a literal house
---
Forgot about it.  It’s easily the best underarmor for stealth characters.
---
I think its only after your first daily op or the first daily op after getting this quest.
---
Okay, I found a thread talking about this from awhile ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fgrqlc/bug_involving_losing_perk_cards_when_leveling_up/
---
Someone in the comments posted their interaction with customer support, which says in part:
---
"If you get a pack that contains a duplicate of a perk card you already have **and can not be ranked up (1 star)**, the duplicate will be automatically removed from your deck."
---
What this means is you'll lose cards from perk packs if you already have them and they are a perk that can't be upgraded, like Fortune Finder, Aquaboy, Picklock/Hacking, etc. What it may also mean is you may lose a card if it can be upgraded, but you already have every iteration of it, for example if you already Revenant 2 (max) and Revenant 1, you might lose it if you get another Revenant 1. But I know for a fact that you can have multiple of the same rank 1 cards, I just don't know if having every upgraded version of it effects whether the level 1 versions would stack anymore. Theroretically it wouldn't, but I can't go back in time and test it pre-update.
---
I counted 29 perks that only had 1 rank and couldn't be upgraded. According to the wiki, there are 205 unique perks total (likely not counting the bow perks but w/e), meaning 14% of the cards in the game were single rank cards that would be lost if you drew them but you already had them. So, on average, and if you round up, you should have lost about one in every six cards you got from the packs, and there's a curve with the odds also being a lot lower in the beginning and only increasing to 14% once you acquire a copy of all of those cards.
---
If you're losing 14% of the cards you get from packs (ignoring the initial curve for the sake of simplicity), that wouldn't account for near the discrepancy that you have, since you only have enough for 4 max legendary perks, which is 1200 perk coins. But there was a lot of fuckery in the early days of the game regarding missing and disappearing perks, and it also depends on how many perk cards you've kept for yourself to use.
---
Did you know that every npc has them now?
---
The weapons you stash in the vendor are taken directly from the stash box. This is why this bug keeps coming up.
---
Lol. There is no 'big issue' with commando, its probably the strongest all around build in the game and leaves you every defensive perk available. Commando has to drop maybe one or two decent offensive perk slots in perception, but they can literally take ALL of the other dmg boosting perks as well. 
---
Try playing a pistol build, and fucking every single relevant perk is agility or luck based. Not only do they not get a Ground Pounder equivalent perk(Crack Shot should be changed to this, its literally useless)but if they have modern renegade and max dmg perks that only leaves 3 points left in agility. Screwing you out of gun fu and adrenaline which are desperately needed to augment lower DPS. Proper pistol builds can only use 3 x Lv1 gunslinger/guerilla perks, costing them 30% base dmg. Also, not being able to utilize dodgy undermines the entire point of having a low AP build. Giving pistols access to a single perception perk this patch literally nearly doubled their viability, which is still probably the worst after bows.
---
Shotties are ok only because of the broken magic effects atm, if you use shotguns outside of vats, they are next to useless, that really seems like a bug. Even point blank headshots don't register as much dmg as a vats torso shot. Shotties and bows need some sort of love or rework imo. Lots of stuff that just doesn't work the way it should. 
---
Pistols really need to have their base dmg perks moved to perception, to make them relevant imo. Left in their current state, but able to go 15p15a15l  they would be pretty good, being able to run more ap regen/dmg perks.
---
Anyone thinking their build is weak should get a bow or a revolver and go run a daily ops.
---
Lol yea definitely a lil much for my taste
---
They can't fix a fun event but were able to give us this trash update
---
Agreed.  I kicked multiple people out of teams today who never joined in any Op. You don't need to run it every time, especially once we hit Elder rank, but you need to be active at least once.
---
Maybe I'm crazy, but I was pretty sure that health is only related to endurance and not level, and AP is only related to agility and not level. Level shouldn't have any impact, other than getting more perk cards/SPECIAL points.
---
I've still only seen the gorilla plans for over 10k caps. However at a SBQ event the other day, someone dropped a bunch of stuff and one was a standing gorilla plan, made me happy because I don't really care to buy it
---
Tried everything, still fail
---
I bet he did.

---
This is my current build after the patch melee as an end game build is quite useless compared to other PA heavy gun builds however if you still want to play melee here's my build.
---
 I now use unarmed instead of 2H because it deals the most damage, for the weapon you optimally want a power fist  with instigating or bloodied and +40 % swing speed since you won't be one hitting enemies. 
---
Now for the armour i don't know if grinding a secret service set would be worth it now but do as you wish, the most important effect will be obviously unyielding but also as a third or secondary effect better AP regeneration as the dodgy perk will drain your ap fast (more on that later). For the arms mods, i didn't test it yet but i think brawling (better unarmed damage ) deals more damage than weighted (better armor penetration) when the power fist has the punctuating mod (better armor penetration). For the torso mod i took dense as it reduce explosion damage and coupled it with dense to be explosion proof (for instance the blood eagle boss in the daily op with the grenade launcher doesn't deal any damage to me none), but as secret service is time consuming to get i cannot test all mods so other torso mods i'd suggest would be pneumatic that reduces stagger or the one that increases the duration of chems. For the legs i take the mod that reduces the ap consumption but you can choose whatever suits you.
---
Now for the skills, some of those skills can be change to your liking however some are fundamental. 
---
Those ones are fundamental:
---
Strenght:
---
-Incisor (melee ignores 75% or target's armor) 
---
-Blocker (reduce incoming melee damage by 45%) useful against ghouls groups or wendigos in the earl event
---
-Barbarian ( increase damage resistance by 80 points)
---
Perception:
---
Nothing useful for melee i suggest maybe glow sight (+20% damage against glowing enemies) or exterminator (ignore 25 % armor)
---
Endurance:
---
-Radicool +5 Strenght at high rads (more on that later about rads and optimal health level) 
---
-adamentium skeleton (important in my opinion as a broken arm/leg causes a huge stagger and slows you down and forces you to use a stimpack making you a easy target)
---
~Fireproof down to preference but this coupled with dense makes you explosion proof, look out though in the earl event the fire particles falling from the roof will obliterate you
---
Charisma:
---
-Strange in numbers (positive mutations +25% if team mates mutated too)  must have + easy perk to share in a team 
---
-Field surgeon  MUST HAVE (stimpack works much more quickly) i dicovered this one recently and oh god how did i missed it this is the best perk for a bloodied build it saves you from poison damage or if you're quick enough the environmental damage in the earl event can't praise it enough 
---
Intelligence: 
---
-Nerd rage (MUST HAVE while under 20 % hp +15 % ap regen +20 damage +40 damage resistance) after the patch this peek still increase multiplicatively the damage output apparently
---
!!!IMPORTANT!!! Nerd rage is the only skill needed for this build but i use a two shot fat man sometimes and grenades to clear groups of enemies this is optional but you need 5 ppints in intelligence to use cards to fully mod/craft  weapons and armors
---
Agility:
---
-Dodgy (avoid 30% of incoming damage at the cost of 30 ap ) very important perk i used to not use it but now that i use it i cannot go back to ignore it now this perk drains ap really fast and you don't want to be immobilized in front of multiple target so that's where in my build i use Action Boy because i don't have the legendary effect that increase the Ap regen
---
-Evasive same as barbarian but 45 instead of 80 
---
Luck:
---
-Serendipity (MUST HAVE gives you 45 % chance to avoid any damage even fall damage)
---
-Starch genes and Class freak (both MUST HAVE  they make mutations viable) 
---
All skill from my build not here means that after the patch they're not that important like damage increase because they stack additionally instead of multiplicatively and that means you're free to customize this build as you see fit 
---
For the gameplay here are some tips on how to deal with enemies
---
Ghouls: agaisnt ghouls you want to deal with them 1 by 1 optimally, if they do the MW2 commando attack it's inconsistent to try to kill them during the charge so i'd advice to block and and hit them while they stagger, if there's multple ghouls block until they attack and retaliate try going around corners as they can't attack by clipping through walls and the ai stand like an idiot giving you some time to regen ap nor use stimpack
---
Robots: do not attack groups of robots you'll die the only way to deal with a group of robots was to use a stimpack while you get close and one hit every enemies while healing barely surviving, this used to work because of your damage output now you can't one hit consistently so don't try except in one situation and it's when you know that mr.gutsys don't have that gun that shoot in a quick succesion of two shot burst else i'd strongly advice to avoid them or maybe if you have a good corner you can use do the same as with the group of ghouls
---
Humans/super mutant : both are like robots except they have a 75% ranged weapons 25% melee distribution and deal significantly less damage, they can still be deadly if you're unfortunate and everyone has a full auto rifle they'll act like robots but you can manage to kill them, focus the ranged enemies first then the melee ones.
---
Insect/Deathclaws/Bears and other melee mutated animals: insect are the ones you want to avoid attacking if they're in group because of the poison damage although thanks to the fast healing stimpack you can barely survive it, if they mostly attack with melee damage blocker comes in handy. For deathclaws bears and other similar types of mobs you want to block their charge, which is often their first attack in a duel then retaliate or if you get poisoned stimpack then retaliate also it might be late for this but blocking nullify enemies physical damage not the poisoning or radiation attack ones !! 
---
If you're looking to deal the maximal damage in chems you want fury(+30 %melee damage, damage resist +25) coupled with overdrive (+15% damage +15% critical damage)  coupled with grognak the barbarian 1 (+15%damage), with a melee or unarmed bobblehead (+20 % damage) and stack up any food that increase melee damage pre patch a youtuber killed earl in a second (+100 k damage) and now i don't know but my bet would be 1000-1300 damage with all buffs. 
---
If you have any questions feel free to reply to this
---
Edit forgot to talk about legendary perks if you have a high level character i'd advice adding to my current build the agility perk maxed to use adrenaline and poison resistance maxed out too for other perks i'd take the chem ones as it's free and maybe the team output and oh yeah  the mutations forgot that too adrenal reaction is a must have with bloodied, scaly skin, grounded, talons, twisted muscles too, carnivore helps with the food buffs, herd mentality is cool and empath is tested in a video and is good even if you create a public team alone don't know about herd mentality though.
---
yeah theyre cussing mostly haha
---
With my shotgunner, gun fu slows me down big time. Someone sharing it while I was doing encrypted. It made getting consistent quick shots off nearly impossible because with gun fu active vats lags on dead enemies before it switches to the next target.
---
Was that the exploding blood eagles op where you did that? Because yes with that specific combo I did get some extra ammo by the end, but for the other ones it's not even close 
---
Plus still, you don't get anywhere near the amount of ammo back using .50 as you would using 5mm or fuel, that seems off to me 
---
I'm not angry about it or anything, just feels like an oversight is all
---
Why are you so dumb and condescending? Is it really that hard for you to understand what I am saying?
---
Dressing up and being spooky is fun, and we love all excuse to drink holidays.
---
super stim packs :)
---
Sometimes the markers don't appear so I had no idea where I was supposed to go.
---
Yeah, it happened to me twice on my low lvl characters. You can't emote to high lvl characters, they feel immediatly insulted. 
---
It's like " They are emotes, like relaxe, i'm not screaming through a mic here ! How old are you kid !?"
---
Man i know there's good ppl in this game, alot of adults (+30 years old ) are playing this game. But the younger side of this community has alot of toxic players. They jump on every opportunity they get to use or test their advantage on other players.
---
I contacted the dude the first time i got kicked out from a Daily Ops group. I just thought it was a bug or something. I didn't even throw emotes on that run. I was doing well, I was on an alt character with hope to get more plans.
---
- " Did you really just kicked me out ? "
---
- " Oh are you gonna cry me a river ? Do you want me to call an ambulance ? "
---
I really hope Bethesda manages to implement a group finder (matchmacking) for this activity or at least a votekick feature.
---
That scorchbeast in the glassed cavern couldve been that if they executed it better
---
[deleted]
---
Oh man I've never had it make vats lag for me, that sucks 
---
I do get really bad lag when I open the weapon wheel most of the time though, not sure what's up with that
---
I just miss easy lvl 5 mobs... Easy to clear workshops for dailies.
---
I'm a chainsaw fan. I second this. It needs love.
---
Yeah throw in the drill too I'd play with one for fun
---
Ohhh thats so cool, they could literally double the map size just by adding more mole miner locations
---
Haha laser go zap
---
I'm nor your hermano, ياخويي.
---
I have a B2525 Plasma Flamer Rifle as well. I got it during the purveyor sale. Primed it and with the Legendary ammo perk, I make 424 ammo per craft plus whatever I get from Super Duper. The second 25 is almost a waste. You don't use vats, you wave it like a magic wand and everything dies. Net loss on anmo in ops though, so easy to hold down the button too long. 300 round ammo capacity is amazing!
---
Yup, do it.  Don't forget electric absorption
---
Bloody mess under luck and Adrenaline under agility help a lot
---
Lvl 150 full health heavy/commando/stealth. Not fully specialized. Slowly (last 50 levels or so) I've been weaning off the QOL perks and moving to more damage &amp; survivability.
---
Instigating explosive 10mm Submachine gun (is that magic?) &amp; Two-shot LMG with faster reload and +33% vats. Buttressed Secret Service armor.
---
Some enemies seem a bit harder, but not much change. Mirelurk Kings were always tough and they seem a somewhat tougher. Yau Gais...  harder. My 10mm takes out most enemies in one burst. If they see me coming make take two. I bring out the LMG for the big boys, SBQ, etc. and it does solid damage.

---
So far the patch has been a plus for me. Haven't tried going back to one of my weaker alt builds yet though!
---
so a melee build is just big dumb now? what are good builds then?
---
Hack and Slash has been pretty kewl.
---
I prefer doing it with my group and I always change off Daily Ops when we've done it (casual) so people can join for the bonus xp (intelligence gives extra xp)
---
Do it dude.
---
No, you're dumb.
---
Now, I have a pudding cup to get back to, stop it before I tell on you.
---
Yes I popped one before I started and had no problem finding enemies.
---
This would be handy. Seems doable as well, since they have other indicators like "in conversation" and such.
---
Ya, to be honest, at this point I've just given up on Bethesda. I loved Elder Scrolls too but I just don't care anymore. Luckily I have The Outer Worlds and soon Avowed if I want those types of experiences but without all of the bullshit Bethesda does in their games anymore.
---
The dress and fixer were probably duped if that makes you feel a little better about it
---
&gt;but for the other ones it's not even close
---
It's not supposed to be an ammo farm. I think it should consume resources, and that's why you get some of the ammo back. 
---
And also, crafting 50 is one of the most profitable things you can do at a workbench, so, there is some kind of balance there.
---
I played everyday and finished season one 3 or 4 weeks early.
---
You gain 100 for every 10,000 xp so that gains you some levels to.
---
The daily tasks are fairly easy to do.
---
The nw ones I only due if simple like survive 10 minutes, gain a level or build a camp.
---
I'll just join and do something else and repeat .
---
I wanted the greenhouse level 99 but then I saw the m16 skin for the handmade so I have incentive to play
---
I've had mine on for a few days no issues.
---

I just assumed thats why we can only gain the benefit of one bobblehead at a time, I wouldn't be able to walk with two of these things shoved up my ass.
---
He's saying the check with the - camp is occupied, join or not dialogue - should be immediately after you click join server, instead of having to load the map, then doing the check. 
---
The back-end already has your characters camp location so it could do a point-radius check against the camp locations of the current players in the server, the server itself doesn't even really need to be involved.
---
And the second issue is it doesn't even greylist the server if you choose find new server so you can repeatedly keep joining the same server even though you've indicated you want another damn server.
---
Same problem for me
---
Yeah whenever gun fu has been a shared perk while on a team, for me (dunno about anyone else), vats seems to wait for the enemies to hit the ground before moving to the next target. Also as a shotgunner, my range is medium to close, so sometimes it’ll switch to the next target in line of sight which will be out of range instead of the closest target. For a longer ranged weapon like rifles or pistols I’m sure it’s great, but shotguns not so much.
---
Good to know! Thank you
---
Sneak sniper is perfect for this game. Im the same and its nuts how much experience u can get now. Its all the ppl who wanted to not do true builds into a specific role that are all crying. Its an RPG but they just want a PG
---
Perhaps the absorption is what turns the energy to electricity?
---
Big brain
---
I run batteries included, ballistic ammo, travelling pharmacy and the grocers mod for my backpack. I maxed out the legendary perception perk and moved 2 per to strength and now i am a good commando/heavy mix. 
---
I tried to be a pack horse at the start of the game but its a waste of time, food is abundant and easy to get/cook, that and water can be an issue at the start but after breaking through that wall, maintaining ammo and picking a preferred weapon is vital.
---
Yes the plan
---
I used more ammo that’s about it
---
And leave, when you are done with daily ops, so the rotation of players to fill in all 4 spots continues
---
I use it on mine and haven’t had any problems
---
Poison infused rad rats.
---
Fireproof perk...in the Endurance special.
---
jet pack glitch, yes. 
---
also, get fireproof. makes explosions feel like nothing
---
I have unpleasant news for you the Plasma Rifle flamer barrel's damage is affected by rifleman, not commando. I was testing perks last night and confirmed this.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
I bought it. It’s cool looking. Sorta lights up a small area in blue. It was cheap. So i just got it.
---
Not if you boot them hard enough.
---
Same problem here on PC. Kill Surge on top of cooling tower, but no Hideout key on body. Filed ticket with Bethesda and they recommended deleting some config files, but it didn't help. I have tried about 6 times now on both Public and Private servers with no luck getting the key to drop. I also noticed Fisher is not in the room, which according to many walkthroughs, he should be.
---
Those “minigames” arent anything beyond a cosmetic. You literally just watch your character fiddle with them.
---
Can you make some recommendations?
---
You'll want two shotguns... Your gauss shotty for longer range (use Skeet Shooter as well) and a non-explosive shotty for close quarters. And yeah, you'll have to unequip/ reequip your chest every log in if you want to see your jetpack.
---
When is it?
---
It's not super easy, but you can solo daily ops IF you know where the endpoints are before hand. Cuts enough time that having to boost the signal yourself won't kill your run. So sadly its just a matter of memorizing the maps. Good times.
---
Using it to farm xp only works sometimes.
---
The melee robots no way
---
Exploding blood eagles yes please.
---
Freezing mutants sure
---
Invisible blood eagles fuck no
---
Yup
---
I agree, people need to lighten up.  I waited and bought a used copy of FO76 for $15 from my local game store, but even if I'd paid full price I'd still feel like I got my money's worth.  I have played every game... Yes even Fallout 1 and Fallout 2... So even though I'm not big on multiplayer games, and I don't often do game content with other players, I still have fun running around the wasteland, exploring and doing the quests and building up my camp.  There's some stuff I can't do on my own, but that's ok. I don't get salty over it. 
---
I do wish a lot of what was in the atom shop was available to find in the game as well, like super rare drops, so you could either choose to grind for it or buy it with Atoms. Or I wish there was more free stuff in the atom shop.  But I understand that Bethesda has to make money! 
---
I'm glad they don't charge for DLC since I wouldn't be able to keep up all the time. Had that problem back when I played wow!
---
Well I'm level 295 so its not like I wasn't carrying my weight.  Also its one wasteland now so almost everyone can help.  Yea I noticed its usually the young kids that are toxic and a lil cocky.  I have had to talk to my son about being toxic a few times.  A vote kick option would be better.
---
Oh I've been there lol. These mannequins have not always been there, otherwise I would not have been able to place my weight bench inside one.
---
Don't know, i optimized this build and it took me way to long to change it now but my guess would be a big gun PA Build, i think power armor somehow take less damage even when DR is about the same, also two shot is better than bloodied now apparently, look for good build post patch in other posts
---
This is correct.  Health and ap never scaled with lvl in the first place.
---
Can you still get plans or outfits after getting elder in a day?
---
Sorry man, I'd help but I'm PC. It's a bummer there haven't been takers yet. Good luck!
---
Yeah I do hear your point, again I don't expect there to be an easy "ammo farm" in the game
---
But again my point is I don't see the point in treating the ammo amount drops for .50 different than 5mm
---
Hell, you mention crafting, you craft both those ammo types in the same amounts I believe, for similar if not identical resources (I'm pretty sure, haven't checked)
---
So it just seems weird the drops in daily ops are different between those 2 ammo types
---
Complaining actually helped to improve the game. But you wouldn’t know when everyone else does the job and you sit back saying “haha dumb people” and then enjoy the benefit other people complained for.
---
Are you sure he didn’t say “wambulance?”
---
Yeah, hum, i play on multiple builds. Non-automatic rifles are definitely the most hit by that dmg nerf. We will definitly need to re-learn how to play this gun type for sure !
---
I used a bffr auto grenade launcher. Been saving it just for this.
---
Yes, yes Ammo Factory is very useful.

Any pics or info?

No. And workshops are PvP zones.
---
They saw an opportunity for free junk and took it.
---
I haven't used Ammo Factory yet. I'm loading up on lead a few more times than I'm hooking up Ammosmith and Super Duper and seeing what kind of 50 cal magic I can make.
---
If the person who owns the provate server leaves and no one else in the server has fallout first after a short time the server will close
---
Get a mule as well, it'll help a lot
---
Public not private
---
I mean killing someone after the sbq because they accidentally tagged you dealing with the spawns after the fight would be a dick move
---
I have an RX 580 and 2600 as well.  I haven't really had a problem with NW, but I don't play it much.
---
Yes...i'm not english, so i just thought he was just trying to act like a lil kid or something
---
Ready to farm and chill broseph
---
Totally agree and I’ve been thinking about a Mirelurk Emperor/Imperator for a while.
---
I propose (and have thrown this idea at BethDevs) to have a “Gone Fishin’” -&gt; “One That Got Away” -&gt; “The Deadliest Catch” sort of quest progression like the Imposter Sheepsquatch arc, teasing and finally culminating in a battle with a giant mutated catfish that must be cleared from the lake next to Thunder Mountain power plant before its offspring hatch and take over the Potomac. 
---
IRL Catfish are a bit of a fight to catch, extremely resilient, and, though native to the Ohio River watershed most of West Virginia drains into, are an invasive species in the Chesapeake Bay watershed that the Harpers Ferry region drains into.
---
Currently the lore of Mirelurks is a bit less murky than I’d like, to be honest. I say this from an evolutionary biology, ecology, and habitat/distribution standpoint. I’m totally cool with the apparent diversity of Mirelurks and the design of them, but the in-game explanations we have regarding them really bother me. Regular Mirelurks are supposedly a hybrid between a crab and a Horseshoe Crab that is then mutated beyond measure. Okay, crazy, but I can roll with that. Mirelurk Hunters are mutated lobsters. Great! Love that for FO4, especially being set in Boston. For FO76 it isn’t explained, but can be handwaved as being local crawdads instead. Mirelurk Queens are not really explained but seem to be amphipods, which is cool to have represented. Mirelurk KINGS, however... are supposed to be mutated snapping turtles?! WTF?! Not okay. Maybe the FO3/NV ones can have a bit more of that kind of body plan, but even those are so clearly humanoid fish. I love the design of the FO4/76 Mirelurk Kings as mutated fish, but am not okay with the in-game explanation of them being turtles. A mutant snapping turtle deserves something with far more gravitas and absurd damage resistance the likes of the giant hermit crabs. I say retcon Kings as mutated fish and build up snapping turtles as a bigger boss.
---
A giant catfish with DR + healing factor in the water it retreats to as a Mirelurk Emperor/Devastator. 
---
Powerful hit, slash, bite and a tail lash that can send you flying, but harpoon projectiles and explosives flush it from the water onto the shore, where energy/fire damage can really hurt it though it tanks ballistic damage.
---
Giant mutant snapping turtle with near-complete DR along shell and still-powerful armor along everything but the mouth and neck as a Mirelurk Imperator/Swamp Guardian. Hard to kill unless you are in its strike zone, where it can stomp for knock back and a seriously powerful armor-piercing bite with slow, telegraphed wind up but fast strike.
---
No, the REAL question is 'When you leave the bug zapper out, do you return to camp to find a pile of dead Mothmen bodies surrounding it'.....
---
I'm still waithing for flamers to work as shown on the actual perk card. I want to heal my teammates with flamer ranged attacks!
---
x450 .50 cal per craft, my dude. It's amazing. If you prime your .50 cal then you're golden. That makes x900 Ultracite 50. cal for that.
---
So I did the op solo and with a team, but didn’t get any rare awards for the day. Just a question many of you may be asking yourselves as well. If you complete the op on elder the first time, but didn’t receive a rare award in the process, is it possible to still gain a rare reward if I try again. I know you can only gain one rare reward per day but didn’t receive anything the first time. Just wondering if it’s with grinding to get the daily rare reward. Otherwise I don’t see much point.
---
Full disclosure: played one toon since release. No idea how mules even work.
---
Seriously, the greenhouse stuff at 2nd to last slot is just mean. I guess I'm going to try to finish this one at least.
---
Negatory.
---
Nope, workshops are PVP area's.  Why didn't you store your junk? I personally hate PVPing but I accept the risk when I have to claim a workshop for a daily challenge, and you better believe I make sure to store my junk.
---
You're right.
---
Sorry. It’s an old way for kids to tease each other, calling the waaaaaambulance
---
Do people really not hit the gyms for lead?
---
That's happened to me. 
---
Now whenever I get a really good drop, I drop an aid item on the ground. It saves your progress when you do that.
---
Keep it in mind.
---
Sweet baby Jesus, that is so smexy
---
I agree, its not the leveling thats the issue. Its the fact that my guns don't go up to lvl 90, my guns now feel like pee shooters against level 90 scorched.
---
Thunder Mountain Catfish boss!
---
So...that was a kid !? lol
---
Tank killer as well if you don’t have it
---
Because I'm level 250 and that's not even considered  high.  I've seen level 1000's.  That would mean essentially infinite health and infinite AP.
---
Is it faster to heal with shishkebab or the chainsaw? 
---
I use my faster swing legendary shishkebab and it's pretty fast. Given the chainsaw RoF it has a potential to do a better job.
---
(ducking) I think it \*should\* count as griefing, but you'll get no agreement on that here.
---
Yeah. I think I'm about to prime my Gatling Laser, but I'm debating on looking in the marker for a new one.
---
What platform do you use?
---
Oh I know thats why I called it "feature" :)
---
XB1
---
I thought they provided something like the weight bench does
---
I like team medic personally! Even 1 rank shared means everyone gets half the healing the team uses, and that leaves more time for shooting enemies.
---
Do you have any friends that you play with, that you can trust?
---
It did not. The alpha is harder now, but still drops a legendary.
---
Yeah maxed out ammo factory + ammosmith + super duper, i got 10k .50 rounds in just 20 enters
---
Nope they are useless
---
To Argentina
---
Sounds great. Thanks for the idea.
---
Now trying to load into my private leads to my game crashing and normal games do a time out before I can even find a world.
---
I'd have thought the character data already would be in a separate database anyway since it's persistent and passed on to any server you join. The only data needed is the camp position and placement limit radius for distance checks. So all of that could be done by the back-end without even involving the server.
---
Tldr; complaining about complaining is still complaining, nothing has changed.
---
Sorry if I framed my question incorrectly. What I was trying to say is all players in fo76 starts with base amount of health and AP which can be enhanced by how you allocate your perk points, it would be great if that base amount rose incrementally with out regards to perk point allocation as you leveled up.
---
Good luck, that place never works out for me.
---
Add the dense mod to your chest piece.  Marsupial mutation in place of the jet pack, 1 rank in fireproof
---
I don't need steal or gunpowder for plasma cores, but close enough
---
Admit it. The reason for this post is to show off your new brotherhood outfit and the glaive weap :D
---
This is 100% true
---
Ive been going over my cards and freed up many perks like armor weight.  And thru hiker.
---
I found the survival syringe is enough and can ditch my food.  And then gaining 10 pounds of armor weight is fine.
---
This frees up points to use in cards that increase damage
---
TL:DR When you hit level 50, Play Skyrim until you develop a proper build for the type of gun you want to use.
---
December
---
There's a lot of various perks in INT that help a lot of different builds out. Not to mention all the extra XP you get from having higher INT.
---
yes but part of them fixing this is people giving them info about what needs to be fixed/buffed/nerfed
---
It's a bit of a dick move but it certainly is not griefing. If the same person does it to you every time you try to take a workshop, that would be griefing.
---
Not sure, I think someone said the The Gutter wasn't added to the pool so I'd assume the same for this. At least until proven otherwise.
---
Even with fireproof, you'll still cripple your own limbs and damage your armor from splash damage. They really need to fix that. No damage should mean no damage.
---
Some people are really stupid.
---
Then again some people just get really upset by people who lock or block off parts of their camp.
---
I know both kinds and you just got to pat them on the head and let them figure it out if you don't want to get on the mic and hold their hands through the learning process.
---
They're probably fine.
---
Well that sucks. Totally skips over season 2.
---
And we get more experience, so now I’m leveling up way faster and I actually enjoy doing challenges.
---
And don't be a dick and kick people out at the end
---
No. If you complete elder on your first run you’re done receiving rewards for the day (except radaway and floater grenades and ammo). Even if you complete elder on your first run and get no rewards your SOL til tomorrow (which is dumb).
---
Turn on pacifist, it prevents this.
---
Reduced weapon weight armor. Its the only way
---
I think the key factor that we need to push is how important anti armour capabilities are to the game post patch. Enemy HP has indeed increased but the real culprit to this new perception of everything being a bullet sponge is the relative increases to enemy defences. AA legendary weapons are going to see a real uplift in use once people in the community realise how efficient they now are in removing high HP enemies from the engagement.
---
Maybe the game wants you to use a 50 cal hunting rifle.
---
You mean [Concentrated Fire](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Concentrated_Fire)? [Gun Fu](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gun_Fu) just swaps targets on kills—it has nothing to do with targeting limbs.
---
I played at launch... and it was exactly what was advertised...
---
Yeah I love it. Best perk ever as of right now
---
Got a vault 94 jumpsuit &amp; caged lights in my Elder run today...the 3 previous runs this week were all caged lights...ugh.
---
The scorchbeast must have had aggro on you before you entered the galleria. Enemies can follow you inside instances. Even inside quest locations like Overseer's home.
---
Its only difficult if you don't have a good setup im level 36 and struggled more before the update than I do now.
---
I think the perk is called Gunsmith in Intelligence. Fully maxed it takes a while for guns to break.
---
It’s also pretty easy to avoid removing them and swapping starched genes in and out to clear rads, was useful for my low luck builds
---
Based on your explanation, I think you were low enough lv that you didn't have a ton of multiplicative effects which made you exponentially stronger than you are now, all in the next 20 or so levels this would have been the case, prepatch.
---
But I think once you get to lv 100+, you will need an optmized build to keep up.
---
Thats the problem with loot-heavy events like these. They're great incentive and all, but when its over you have the same game now with less payout and reward. The mental drive to achieve just isn't as fun during the event down times.
---
I've had this happen once or twice.. you just have to watch your back, dump your junk before going to workshops... also, I'll often claim one, then run to the border and keep looking at the map to see if anyone warped in...
---
How do you join a team? I always play solo, am level 63, no particular "build", more of a casual player... I thought I'd check it out since it was new, I kept checking the Op details cos I thought it might tell how many people have joined the event but never saw anyone doing it. So I just joined by myself and got instantly caned, I died so many times before admitting defeat, lol.
---
That's a dick move by Bethesda.
---
If you have your weapon favorited, there should still be a button to inspect it. From there, you should be able to use a repair kit or improved repair kit without having to open up your pip-boy.
---
I couldn't believe this so I ended up testing it myself. Went to the toxic valley golf course, killed the grafton monster, lined up all the roaches. No damage. They all died after a few hits because I had thorn armor on. Took ALL my armor off (53 dr because underarmor and scaly skin), went over to more max level roaches...fucking nothing, like 10 damage a hit with blood worms. And they have ~40 hp
---
Robots are very target specific. Assaultrons and protections are weak in the arms and legs. Very tanky to headshots. Cripple one leg on an assaultron and it becomes a pushover. 
---
Mr. Gutsy are also weak in the limbs. They're really weak in the thruster, but that's a hard target. I go for the rear leg on a sentry bot and head on robotrons.
---
I maxed two special ones
---
And have 1 star sneak attack one and survival syringe.
---
I'm debating if the sneak attack one is useful as I'm a vats sniper and I kill everything in 1 or 2 shots anyways without it still.
---
Can't decide if I should get rad removing one or more special points.
---
Then I want the ammo one to dang it
---
That’s weird, I unequipt a couple that I had up to 3 stars and they are still 3 stars for me. Did it only happen because they were maxed out do you think?
---
They kinda have an old-school Borderlands feel to them, especially the Blood Eagle ones.
---
didn't realize that having high INT give you more EXP in this game.
---
Funny shit!
---
Bethesda didn't want you to get a magic weapon
---
Great thank you
---
I was level 714 and was still 250 points shy of maxing out the 6th legendary slot.
---
Yea I see it here and there not everywhere but it's common enough to see a few times a day. I play on PC so it's more saturated.
---
It doesn't mean I'm going to use them though.
---
That bug was reportedly patched, but apparently resurfaced after patch 22. I haven’t ran into any problems myself though.
---
They shouldn't, but this is fallout 76. I once had a scorchbeast come into the glassed cavern with me. Not the one you meet at the end, a normal one. It was flying through the ground/ceiling and aggroing the mirelurk kings near the end. The one you meet in the end is not able to fly, this was just a random scorchbeast spawn
---
I help people hit elder all day hit me up.
---
Berry Mentats
---
It is *immensely* disappointing. I finally got my partner into 76 and was telling them all about mischief night (we both love halloween &amp; holiday game events) and then I saw the news. That event was honestly some of the most fun I've had with this game and it was pretty crushing to see that it's not coming back.
---
Yea but I mean what bench do you craft it with chemistry, or is it the brewing station I have yet to unlock those.
---
 And while you are at it, the log cabin could use some stairs too
---
Welcome to reddit lol
---
tell them to get good then
---
I don't think it is repeatable. He tells you to come back after you are done with your daily op, just like the first time, but it triggers no quests.
---
You really feel like huntin afk bush wookiees?
---
Could you imagine if it was another major effect instead.  Bloodied two shot explosive 15% faster reload?
---
It must just be some conflicting coding I’d imagine, since I’ve seen incidences of different varieties and some lucky folk aren’t even having the issue. 
---
It’s honestly strange, like I’m doing more damage whilst not sneaking, and just running and gunning.
---
Like I shit you not, yesterday I was getting 600-800 damage headshots in VATS, Running and Gunning and not utilising sneak, using my Ultracite Laser Rifle consecutively which is the damage I should be doing whilst in sneak mode with the Fallow Through perk. 
---
It’s a tad wonky in the aspect that it’s bug effect is completely randomised. Sometimes it’ll be that ADS sneak is working fine but VATS is doing half the damage, other times it seems like I’m Rambo just doing magic damage for no good reason at all.
---
To be fair I've crashed plenty of times, and I have a pretty decent PC. It was definitely a problem a lot of us were facing.
---
Crys in level 37.
---
Nothing is there that would be nostalgic right now. I’d rather avoid previous areas that have been visited before and go to new areas.
---
Thanks for taking the time to post.
---
Personally I haven’t had any problems, but I did hear some youtubers discuss the bug was back as of patch 22
---
I just relogged and it turned out to be a UI glitch. Still reported to BGS but deleted post to keep people from rioting
---
I use the Plasma Rifle Flamer/Sniper 
---
Ultracite Laser Rifle 
---
Handmade 
---
Lever action 
---
And Black Powder Rifle
---
Lasers create an ionization path that becomes fairly conductive.

---
I have no idea. But the xp new is kind of ridiculous.  Doubling it will be insane.
---
ammo types are a random range based on the type of ammo. Not any basis on enemy kills. But of course if you're ammo efficient, the more enemies you kill, the more you can loot from their bodies. As a bloodied build I always gain ammo from kills.
---
One of them has raiders outside of it now, who killed the existing Mole Miners and boarded the tunnels up! Which is sad, but it means they're doing *something* with them.
---
I suggested this before and got nothing but negative responses lol. I thought it would be cool for trap door spiders in the savage divide and toxic valley regions. Then for mire area spiders that dropped down from the trees the size of a honey beast
---
Sorry, no, but isn't it apples and oranges? They behave so differently.
---
I want a daily ops emote. That way I can throw up the emote and it’ll show in the team list on screen I’m about ready to go do the daily ops.
---
Bloodied but I don't use Unyielding.  Max weight is 240 lbs (Str is listed as 2,) usually carry between 170 and 190 on at all times.  I have one piece of gear with 20% weapon weight reduction.  Only weight perk I use is Bandolier.  I have the level 50 Chemist backpack.  
---
Armour weight is about 44 which includes equipped, CSS and one PA.  Weapon weight is about 66, this is 6 guns and some grenades.  Ammo, chems and other aid make up the rest, leaving me a bit of room for whatever I pick up.
---
You wasted gold bullion on the jet pack before having all pieces and the mods?
---
That’s why [Loads of Ammo](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9057) is my favorite Fallout 4 mod. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see if modding is ever supported for this game because I don’t see Bethesda doing this.
---
Ur in my NW lobby 🥰❤️❤️❤️
---
Very true
---
I'm on that mission now and it just seems like an open ended waypoint? Like does walking along, following it eventually lead me to the Flatwoods monster? Bc I can't seem to find waypoint destination on the big map so as to fast travel closer or have any idea of the general area it's supposed to be. Am I just supposed to kind of wander the map in that direction till I find him?
---
Mmmm nah, it’s a pvp zone, he is, however, a dick.
---
Yeah and it’s minions would be a no-brainer - just have the entire family of mirelurk variants accompany it.
---
I hope you didn't miss the Triple XP event during April's Fools week or however long it was. That shit was insane. So many friggen nuke drops.
---
Max level bandolier, batteries included, ordnance express, travelling pharmacy (if possible), thru hiker (if possible) and a backpack with either chemist‘s or grocer‘s mod to offset whatever is missing from travelling pharmacy and thru hiker. And weapon reduction perks for whatever weapon category you’re using. 
---
PA heavy is kind of tricky though - no backpacks and I need all my perks for damage, bear arms and bandolier. Travelling pharmacy is only at rank 1 there, so I try to not carry more than 40 stims at once. And the PA is an excavator with calibrated shocks.
---
Most important is to stop hoarding crap tho.
---
I got a bloodied 50blocl 90rw tenderizer.. I’m very happy people are inpatient. Plus , the bos are knobs so why look like one .
---
Hey bro! Happy to help. My brother and I play quite a bit. No need for mics either. We’ve been running through the daily ops pretty easy. I’ll be on later in the afternoon tomorrow if you have trouble getting it done. Shoot me a PM and I’ll give you my gamertag.
---
Which is tricky while controlling your character. The smart move is to find a good pile of corpses to stare at.
---
Same here. It looks bombastic, though.
---
easy for you to say, sneak builds will always be good regardless of any nerfs, My bloodied build got fucked
---
Exactly anyone complaining is for the most part just lazy, hate change, and/or hate a challenge. If it’s too hard, it’s so easy to find people to help you out get you better gear etc.
---
You can still pick up mutations you don't want though.
---
That a funny way to spell Mr. New Vegas
---
I immediately leave the group when I'm done with my run of daily ops. I think it's a clear indication of my intentions and also I make room for new people to join the group. If someone doesn't want to do daily ops within a few minutes, they shouldn't be in such a group.
---
Mine is blank too but if you click on it it gives you some more info. Very boring looking PA paint, another stein that almost no one will care about, the game board decoration and 500 atoms. Very lackluster imo but at least there are some other cool items along the way. The Captain Cosmos paint at least looked unique.
---
Hit me up. BalboaTheRock
---
Yeh more creepy creatures sounds good
---
I suspect they haven't changed from whatever was published on the wiki. The tables that determine spawn stats aren't typically messed with. I could be wrong however.
---
The recent balance changes would imply that isn't the case haha
---
but yeah, that's most likely the reason, just seems dumb cuz no one uses those
---
Yes... it's also a good reason to join the casual public teams, once you get linked, you get more INT per person in the team = even MORE xp on top of whatever XP boosts you already have.
---
Angry Turtle did some testing on the best legendary effects recently, hopefully it helps. AA is a lot better than before
---
https://youtu.be/9EeNcV7OxZU
---
That low of a level, I would consider using a melee build. Save all your ammo until you have a good amount and then go ham.
---
Nope, once per day is all you can try for. There's a 17.1% chance each day not to get any rare rewards. Which, honestly, is better than almost every other event in the game. A Colossal Problem is a definite outlier as all the 'rare' rewards have about the same drop rate and you're guaranteed to get at least 1 per run.
---
F click X T click...Not bad! Thank you!
---
Overall this update killed my 2 years grind, i use a bloodied unyielding melee build and in my opinion the pre patch fallout 76 damage was 10 times better because right now the only viable build are ranged weapon build (bloodied or PA) and melee builds were already rare before the patch (by rare i mean in the earl event i'm always the melee guy and last week was the first time i saw a melee build) , and pre patch the majority of builds revolved around stealth vats / commando or heavy PA build because it's safer and deals more damage at longer range (meaning a ranged build will one hit a mob before you have the time to get to it which hasn't really changed to be honest) except on bosses where melee hits 1400 or 2400 with headshot making it relevant in the game (if you forget magic weapons) to explain my build i'll simply paste a comment made on another post to explain my build to, it's detailed, explains most important perks, mutation, the weapon, armors and general enemy encounters and how to deal with them i'm open to critism and open to debate:
---
About legendary perks if you have a high level character i'd advice adding to my current build the agility perk maxed to use adrenaline and poison resistance maxed out too for other perks i'd take the chem ones as it's free op chems every hours and maybe the team output and oh yeah  the mutations forgot that too adrenal reaction is a must have with bloodied, scaly skin, grounded, talons, twisted muscles too, carnivore helps with the food buffs, herd mentality is cool and empath is tested in a video and is good even if you create a public team alone don't know about herd mentality though.
---
Seems like fewer vendors at the moment so I suspect lots of players are being cautious and closing up shop for now.
---
I basically live on berry mentats since INT is king with all that seasonal stuff and I also noticed one other bug: it tends to lose its glowing effect completely sometimes. Never happened before the patch but right now playing the game I started to look more often in my pipboy to see if the effect is still there. And most of the time it is, but the graphical part vanishes from time to time until the next one is popped.
---
**points** There's the door. You can mosey on along with that nonsense.
---
I am all in on new things to kill, especially if they add new and interesting mechanics to the game. Spiders would also add to the utility of Funky duds if they have poison damage.  Do it Todd!
---
Challenges, and gathering resources.
---
So its still worth it for rifleman builds then?
---
I am level 90 or so now, but I have been using a perk combo to solve that:
---
  -&gt; Gunsmith level 5 (under intelligence. You can use legendary perk Infiltrator to replace all lock pick and hack cards; as to not take up all your INT). Keep active tho as it slows weapon degradation.
---
  -&gt;To repair my weapons I swap off gunsmith and use the gun repair perk (forgot name) also under INT maxed to 200% repair. Then swap the perks back.
---
  -&gt;Bingo Bango
---
Level 25 sniper. A day of hell. Then adapted and am doing ok.
---
I could see not wanting gun fu either.
---
I did noticed that today, damn, maybe I should close up 😩
---
I would say AA. With the new update, I’m not sure how much of a damage increase AA gives, but it used to be around 28%. The current number shouldn’t be too far off either, as AA wasn’t nerfed too hard. I’d rather have the consistent AA damage bonus than only a bonus when the enemy is below a certain health percentage.
---
It apparently does not in certain situations, had a friend killed by it with pacifist on.
---
I’ve been playing since pre-alpha and have multiple characters. One thing I noticed is that with one wasteland the scaling seems correct for the level and overall experience with the game. I can see how people who play the game without any rpg experience can struggle.
---
- On my top tier 200+ character that I’ve been playing since release with a god weapon that if I look at an enemy that’d die. Well I can’t just look at them and they die anymore but I can still two shot. The shotgun works more like it’s intended purpose. 
---
- On my mid grade 100 or so that I only use for instagram stuff and haven’t taken the time to go through and work on perks I easily get overwhelmed by enemies.
---
- Any new one I made to play with my gf on her level recently hit level 43. All the guns I picked up are solid and act like the gun I using. It’s satisfying to see that the damage I’m dealing is significant even when I’m weak af.
---
Overall: Get a good gun and build before you reach level 100.
---
Building, scavenging &amp; exploring. 
---
Also just ignoring content while doing that &amp; getting around to it latet
---
Ummmm.... So just WENDIGOS with more legs?
---
While we're on this topic, don't share aquaboy or anything that gets rid of rads.
---
The hilarious thing is, everything is still floating 😂😂
---
How is aquaboy bad?  I’ve never done bloody
---
I like to make a new team so I'm the leader and can switch the group to Casual after we're done.
---
And the other radiation perk that slowly makes you lose radiation during the day, as well as aquaboy.
---
We don't, I got to lvl 200, got bored and stopped playing, also because I have noone to play with
---
Is that with vats targeting? If so, what perl level is needed to make an interesting difference?
---
What is the sympto matic?
---
Commies don’t get nice things
---
I know everyone is enthusiastic and all, but is there any real reason to make an NPC that can’t attack you hostile? Why assume that it would be an entrance to a friendly mole miner city when instead it could just be more tunnels and potentially be a tunnel into some Vault or whatever. If players could kill it what would be the point of having it there? 
---
It alludes to something, no doubt about that, but assuming they are friendly is kind of a leap because making it hostile and killable makes no sense.
---
Well right now i'd say try to avoid playing with non-automatic rifles ( especially Bolt action rifles ). Bethesda will definitly need to re-work this weapon type...
---
I wasn't seing issue with the dmg nerf until i play on my Bloodied sniper build lvl 110. Bethesda destroyed this weapon type ! 
---
I moved from a Bloodied Lever Action rifle build to a simple Bloodied non-automatic rifle build on this character, yes it's a lil better but honestly i can put GunFu and Adrenaline to the trash. It takes me near an whole clip to kill something. This is terrible !
---
There's something called toxic goo that bloodied builds use and aquaboy disables its effect.
---
High capacity backpack, every weight reduction perk I can get, weight reduction armor. Usually have 410 capacity, Excavator PA if I need a few more pounds.
---
I have a few QOL perks , thru hiker , batters not included. Everything else is dmg or damage mitigation . Also lvl 400 , used my legendary effects to buff out a few of my specials. The legendary perk system is definitely amazing for veteran players .
---
CANT WAIT
---
I’m very frustrated by this to the point of not wanting to play them. All my friends are heavy automatic builds and I can’t hardly get a shot in between getting shredded and having to reload my guns. I don’t care if this is just for the uplink variety of daily ops. It’s all we have right now and I end up getting stuck doing other things by myself because my friends are all getting crazy experience from the ops and want to keep spamming it.
---
Do you play on PS4?
---
With tank Killer, concentrated fire 1 and three levels of rifleman + an Instigating 50 cal I was able to solo the event yesterday, against the mutants. 
---
It's about trying and checking.
---
It’s the disease cure machine located in Misc while building, rare chance to receive the plan from daily ops
---
We as the players, pay their wages through the sale of the game. They have not listened to the community properly when it comes to valid changes that will improve the game for ALL to play but instead make irrelevant changes to suit their needs and line their pockets. Truth hurts, but its reality. This is one game Bethesda has lost more than they can afford too.
---
I'm so much happier since I started doing the "New character" strat for leveling up. So much relaxing getting done within 30-60 minutes and logging off for the day rather than grinding like hell for 2-4 hours to level
---
Yes, I know you can skip challenges.... but if I ignored "level up" every day, that is a LOT of score for something I can do in 5 minutes  
---
I'm skipping "Kill/Revive" in NW this time, too much work for 250 points.
---
So one choice...the door or the light?
---
It was the first time for me also. I had every gun I ever wanted so I tried my luck with armor. Never again.
---
Or dodgy for those of us who have vats builds.
---
Yeah, pacifist will prevent this. Just figured I'd warn other people of the bug.
---
I tried joining/creating teams. Nobody joins the Op. Thankfully I have soloed all of them in elder, but goddamn is the clock is not tight. 1 mistake can push u over 8 minutes if ur by urself.
---
Cuz you say its true it must be true. Dont worey bro i believe you
---
A disease cure machine. Fuck me, I need that thing.
---
Everytime I die my rad's are healed some. Fucking annoying as a bloody build. So I eat spoiled meats to bring it back. I always get a disease that gives me that skitters that I have to cure
---
Yes, but I have no idea where my game is, I stopped playing once they added the first battle pass or whatever the hell its called
---
I did, but at 7.59. 
---
Total thrill.
---
With the xp challenge and grinding xp/higher xp from enemies now, I'm at 21 and absolutely shooting up the board just from that.
---
My new character is lvl 18 at the moment, I’m having the most luck with a hunting rifle for sneak kills (2x damage will generally kill regular enemies) and a shotgun for up close. Pistols and pipe weapons are useless. It’s definitely harder than it was three months ago when I started playing the game with my first character (now lvl 130 or so, not having trouble with the update).
---
But don't you want to take less damage? /s
---
Yeah I know how to get it, it's not dropping on him.
---
It sucks that they chose to sneak you. I typically throw on the ol' stealth suit to be safe lmao
---
If your lucky enough to find someone with it, they can plan it at your camp. been going from camp to camp placing it down for others
---
Yikes, if someone legit does this, they deserve the worst.
---
NO SPIDERS
---
That’s great and all, but it shuts out those of us who do rely on stealth from this one. How long is the uplink going to last? Am I going to get over-frustrated every day for months because my friends want to keep doing the ops constantly? I don’t want to just sit in one place and try to solo the event, but I would like to be able to contribute. 
---
All of my damage buffs are stealth based. 
---
I use vats constantly because I’m not good at aiming - but everyone is one-shot killing everything before I can get a shot in at all, so I’m barely getting any experience. It’s shitty, and we’re basically the only build that’s been rendered useless for this.
---
Strange in numbers too
---
Don't you need to learn the plan to use it?
---
That means no bloodied though, which is bad news.
---
I use Luck of the Draw perk card. Works pretty well if you have an automatic weapon. There's another one for armor that does the same thing. My guns usually repair themselves.
---
I've managed to knock Fisher down by throwing nades through a hole in the windows but you can't kill him, so you can't even brute force your way through it. Hopefully Bethesda can fix this.
---
lol?  look I love the game but it's no secret that it wasn't what it was advertised at launch. Did you miss all the memes?  It's why they allowed for mass refunds.
---
SS+1S for DPS, PA+1S for Damage, and whatever initial prefix you prefer. I like SS90 because I can always keep it on me and switch to it whenever I feel like running melee. PA40 is also great for spongy enemies.
---
would think so, people can enter it same as me. usually forget about diseases so can’t say i use it
---
Light
---
I'd say the light. Personally, I'm gonna save my atoms for cooler stuff (maybe) or for the final SCORE levels if I dont have time/they're too grindy.
---
I agree people are over reacting
---
The wiki does not list lvl 100 super mutants at all.
---
One of my friends has been playing this game from the beginning but is a huge arachnophobe, this would literally make the game unplayable for her. I don’t think they need to actively drive away players with this kind of enemy design...
---
alrighty, thank you!
---
Lucky. I either get Parasites or Dysentery so I have to get rid of them.
---
I agree! The update has just made leveling easier. I will say this, go easy on the trigger, damage registers slower than fire rate so a lot of people are over spending.
---
Most of the enemies you could one shot before are two shotted now, just wait out the slight delay
---
B-but I want nice things, Brotherhood-senpi.
---
ALL of my armor is constantly broken now ALL the time.
---
Because to repair all of it, I need about 20 ballistic fiber.
---
I used to be able to run around a few forts and areas around the starting zone and in 15 minutes I'd have enough to fully repair my armor.
---
Now, every place I go, Im being hit and shot at by lvl 50 EVERYTHING and it takes me forever to gather what I need, and my armor ends up in WORSE shape than when I started.
---
I am NOT enjoying the game any more. It feels like work now.
---
Yea before you know it the next trend is gonna be bitching about people bitching! 
---
Slow down with all the bitching already peeps, gosh!
---
The notification is not really clear. I have to get used to read it immediately or it disappears fast.
---
Was kicked out of the team, though, on the third time (edit: after the boss). Probably was doing something wrong. I can guess when you do rounds after you got elder the agenda is different.
---
Yeah but we're not getting any Double XP weekends this season.
---
I can agree to those things but 9 times out of 10 I blantly use a cure because it’s second nature to keep going
---
Yea those are the only two I cure. Everything I just let them run their course.
---
I was this person today and I felt awful. Had a full team of four, max bond, and then they joined an Op as soon as an emergency popped up and I had to promptly step away. I left the party as soon as I could, but yeah. I was a monster today inadvertently.
---
That all said, 100% agree otherwise.
---
I hereby nominate you as the Worlds. Greatest. Fallout. Fan.
---
Wow!
---
Though, I will jump in if it's not a full team.
---
Make sure your sneaking
---
There are only 3 factions.  Robots, blood eagles, and super mutants.  Robots are a non problem.  Blood eagles and super mutants are slightly worse, but not too bad.
---
None of the areas really concern me.
---
Freezing was annoying but ultimately not detrimental.  Resilient... well I guess I'll just tank the damage and move on.  
---
Nothing about the ops really concerns me.
---
Doesn’t really matter if your already doing a lot of damage with bloodied build. too bad that patch hit us pretty hard
---
I have 4. Take one for the team, legendary Charisma, legendary agility and master infiltrator. All at the same time.
---
I love Gun Fu. I wouldn’t recommend 3* in it, but 1-2 is still a great choice for any stealth build.
---
Increase AP with a high base agility, the bird bones mutation, ultra-light armor pieces, and certain mods for your rifles (aligned barrel, forceful stock, reflex sight and, though I’d rather go with armor pen, quick magazine). Automatic receivers also cut AP cost in half.
---
Is it in the workshop area? Could you take over the workshop and then build stairs up?
---
I havent really noticed that much of a dropoff. Granted, the nerf is noticeable. But it also doesnt feel any different than before. My BE 50 cal is still my primary.
---
Daily ops
---
Scorpions are arachnids
---
Armor still works. I just added a piece to my set and my pump action damage went crazy.
---
Demolition Perk increases Launcher Explosives.
---
Heavy Gunner affects all Heavy Guns, except Explosive Launchers. This includes weapons like Explosive Gatling Guns getting extra damage from Heavy Gunner Perks.
---
Get another chest piece and put dense on it, fireproof, and adamantite skeleton
---
Man, that sucks, but RL definitely comes first 👍
---
Just don't think your situations is common to what I am seeing though. 
---
Hope your day/night got better. Stay safe out there, fam
---
It'd be cool if I could see it before my team shreds it to pieces.
---
Ah, haven’t seen much from my BFFR but once i noticed my shotgun lost 500 damage I was upset. Then I realized that i’m still 1 shoting stuff
---
No thanks. I already spend enough time going back and forth with gear and weapons. Different characters different weapons different ammo.
---
Just make the Glaive base plan purchasable with bullion like the mods are, problem solved.
---
Make the price max bullion if you have to, idc.
---
Bruh you are wasting your perk points. Get hack and slash
---
100% has happened to me. So lame
---
Dude I lived it! It was exactly as advertised. A fallout game... online... in Appalachia... buggy (that last one’s just implicit because Bethesda).
---
Nah when it says “non-explosive” it means weapons that when under normal conditions eg. Not legendary are not inherently explosive weapons. An example of an explosive weapon in this case would be a Missile launcher, Fatman etc. A non explosive heavy gun would be stuff like mini guns 50. Cals and the LMG
---
Well you have the endendendgamegear so it shouldn't be hard anyway because otherwise it would be impossible for people that like more choices or roleplaying.
---
Most video games address this by giving you a difficulty level. Obviously harder to to with a multiplayer game. Bethesda tried to approximate that with different leveled regions and spawns based on player level. Among other things, this made it hard for teams with mixed-level players. (Hard for everyone to have fun, anyway.) 
---
I always thought 1W was another attempt at resolving that problem (hence the "one). I see a level 50 scorched, you see the same enemy as level 20. Sounds great on paper, and perhaps it works well in practice. I have no first hand experience. 
---
But, they up-leveled the regions where most of the casual players were hanging out without up-leveling the players or their damage. It seems to me they could address much of the furor by dropping the difficulty for mid-level players a bit. I could still see a lvl 50 rad roach but now you see level 10 instead of 20. 
---
Dunno, maybe that's how it all works. And maybe they really do want to ditch the casual players. It seems unlikely, but a company struggling to find it's audience will do crazy stuff to see what sticks.
---
PA + Emergency Protocols active + a Vamp heavy with a high rate of fire makes you practically immortal. I highly recommend.
---
Modding being supported would be impossible outside of private servers. There is literally no fathomable way to do it.
---
It should be like the Assaultron Helmet. Holstering your weapon opens it, entering combat closes it.
---
My phone can run this game better than your pc
---
Yea, I was in the 300 or 400s, cant remember, with the 50 cal. Last I looked I think my damage is something like 165 or something. Im still running through enemies, although I can tell it takes a bit longer now but its not too bad.
---
I like the idea of having to pick locks using only audio like a true safecracker
---
People may keep downvoting here, but this is the crux of it. You have an online "game as a service" thing, you're gonna have caps on endgame currencies, for the simple reason that it's the easiest way to pad out the bunch of rewards made for those: ensuring not only a minimum longevity they will last, but also forcing players into starting up the game on a daily basis. (Need those stats to keep the service alive, after all.) And it's exactly because of people like OP, who grind so much they would eat stuff up planned for &lt;randomnumber&gt; months in two or three weeks, and then complain about not having new shinies to obtain, because there's no way any team could keep churning shit out fast enough. Can't make stats for the shareholders on empty platitudes like "things are fun, i promise i'll keep playing every day anyway". 
---
It sucks on several levels from our perspective, but this is where the industry is atm.
---
Do love the update, the daily ops are fun and a bit challenging. the nerf was need to get bloodied out of the meta
---
&gt; You'll have every reward in about 2 weeks.
---
Considering I have more than 500 hours in the game, played since Wastelanders, and have grinded Radiation Rumble every time it pops, and STILL don't have the rad barrel plan... yeahhh I don't believe you, sorry.
---
Your list of complaints are written as if it's one type of player complaining, showing you fail to understand why people are saying contradictory things.
---
There's very likely some engine-related restriction as to why. The engine itself was never meant to be multiplayer so they cobbled it together while developing FO76.
---
People are definitely overreacting. But I will say that non-auto pistols are in a bad place right now. I had 3-4 pistols that I considered to be viable on my newest character before the update and now it’s more like 1-2. I haven’t got tank killer on him yet so maybe that will make the difference.
---
Yeah? Never even realized that and i have both
---
Im lovin the update so far. Two I dont like about it though.
---
1. Resilient enemies suck. They arent fun, theyre just annoying.
---
2. Everytime I complete a challenge or gain a SCORE level, all my completed SCORE levels complete again and I have to listen to that ding constantly and its driving me up a wall.
---
Hey man. If you can't stand shooting an enemy for more than 5 times to kill, this game ain't for you. Absolutely unplayable. People are quitting rn this game so disgusting. Btw, they disabled two wall something exploit. I mean they patched an exploit! how could they do this? Do they not think of the playerbase? Patching an exploit is not acceptable! We must riot!
---
There are plenty of critiques, but alright. Low level players face enemies that level up with them, meaning the difficulty level goes with them. There's no going back and farming for resources against easier enemies, because they don't exist. This impacts ammo and the ability to fix their breaking weapons and armor. Farming simply does not exist for them. If you run out of ammo, have few caps, and broken armor, you're done with the game. There's no way forward.
---
There are many reports, if you'd care to listen, to players hitting an absolute wall around level 20, where they cannot advance. 
---
This is an enormous barrier for new players. I don't know why more players aren't seeing it. I don't know why you don't see it. But there's a lot of selfishness and blindness involved in this game. Most players just don't care about the future health of the game, which depends on expanding the user base. Most high-level players respond to these players with stuff like, "Just make a better build." Which is some of the stupidest, most clueless shit I can imagine.
---
4k fuel to 8k playing as close range damage nuke and friendly fire support. Takes maybe 8-12 fuel to kill something. Highest drop I've seen for fuel is 32.
---
I think he was just farming exp and ammo in there and didn't want it to end. Nothing to do about it but to start your own Daily Ops team.
---
Sorry but youre analysis is flawed and a knee jerk reactive post undermining numerical based criticism isnt doing anything to address the majority of the issues. As gatling guns were among the least affected.
---
The biggest issue is HP scaling for enemies vastly outpaces the curve on weapons. Midgame is a disaster.
---
Unarmed recently joined rifles and pistols in the “why would you main this” catergory
---
Besides that. If youre bloodied normally get your hands on a bloodied gatling laser look at the damage and ask yourself if it makes sense. The new damage model is incredibly sloppy with numerous inconsistencies.
---
Amen, brother!  They creepy.   
---
Regards, Arachnophobe
---
Where do you get the mods for the glaive anyway? I just unlocked the glaive but it didn't show any mods in the weapon workbench menu, not even the 0/3 mods learned or whatever
---
5mm can drop close to 100 on a body, and for my build takes about 5-7 shots per person. The return is insane!
---
That’s fine. I don’t mind it. I’m really just looking for a new game to play with my friends. Do you think they’ll fix it?
---
No
---
Thank you
---
Ah, gotcha. It's a double-edged sword though. For PvP purposes, higher leveled players would have the advantage every time. It would be nice for PvE though.
---
Maybe the gun type. I've used medics shotgun +33 vats  and limb damage for months now including today. Working great but maybe cause its one of the magic bugged ones.
---
I haven't played melee for a long time. When I did I used sneak making good use of the Unyeilding buff to agility. Not sure how that would go with One Wasteland.
---
I mostly use a power fist and a gatling gun for ranged combat. 5 mm ammo weighs very little. I only keep on myself the weapons and eqipuipment I actively use. I have the chems backpack mod, so carrying 100 stimpaks is not an issue. I often scrap my carried junk. I don't have any weight reduction perks equipped. With all the above my usual carry weight is around 150 lbs (my max. is around 370).
---
I've definitely experienced this, it's taught me to fire in bursts rather than just laying waste. The only time I can full auto and not see some damage issues is bummer sponges like Earle
---
A MothMan boss or the interloper would be sick
---
Oh i hate that new SCORE bug but the resilient enemies are a nice challenge, so long as it’s not using a bs unarmed bugged damage
---
Yeah most of the time, it's just people sitting in parties. It feels like half the time people are just waiting for someone else to pull the trigger.
---
My build is far from optimized but as a melee build I’m definitely doing half or less the damage I used to do and taking a lot more damage
---
ill say a prayer for you tonight
---
Yup which screwed me up because I didnt read enough into it. So have been tempted to remove it,  but figured I had to play with my build anyways since the patch so grabbed a vampire's gun and started using that for a while, just using more ammo. Will play both mannerisms, just giving it a week as a full health, then will try a little junkies in the mix too and see what I like and make the call. Would be nice to offload the shit ton of rad away and diluted I'm carrying around, hoarders gotta hoard.... amiright?!
---
First time I saw them behind windows or stacking  sideways it took me few seconds to figure it out. I love it when the machines are incorporated cleverly into a camp. Kudos.
---
I feel your pain Comrade. I had to remove all my stuff and move my benches to an outbuilding with my generator.
---
So if I were to get let's say a furious explosive .50 cal then it would still get the damage boost from the Heavy Gunner perk?
---
Seems like this pops up everytime a camp budget exploit is patched
---
Yeah, it has some missing data for sure. I wish I could help you, sorry.
---
Yes it would :)
---
There's these big guns thats bullets blow up.  Always no matter what perk the gun has. These ones aren't made better by heavy gunner perks. 
---
 There's other big guns that sometimes can have bullets that blow up, but normally don't. Thats the guns that the heavy gunner perks make better.
---
They should just introduce the "incinerator barrel" to change it from spray to projectiles.
---
So did I. Maybe it was you?
---
Ugh, they're annoying. I dont mind the enemies that blow up, I quite literally forget they do that with every enemy and Im constantly getting hit a bunch. And I actually really like the camo'd enemies because you cant lock on with VATS when they're in camo. But Resilient can get out.
---
What rads is OP
---
Traveling pharmacy is your friend.  Personally I like vampire's at low health, you still get a 70%+ damage increase and essentially can't die.
---
There’s people afraid of clowns but there’s a clown costume. Phobias are irrational fears, so can be anything. Any game will touch on some phobia. So it’s pointless to try and avoid them. 
---
I do hear you can get counseling for phobias,to make it manageable.
---
Jump server, it will be in a different area of the map. If you already have two let's say, that will stay with you when you jump the server. You'll still only need that one more. By the way  if you have the broken tube you can repair it. That will complete the mission without the other. 🥳
---
Yeah!!!!  This is Awesome!!
---
You MUST find a reliable melee weapon when grinding below 50. I had such a hard time crafting/finding ammo. 
---
I would recommend a deathclaw hand. That's what I used. If you're on PC I can look into crafting you one.
---
Given that it has a lower drop rate than the red asylum dress, and cannot be infinity farmed by server-hopping like the asylum can, I'd say that's actually a good trade.
---
No freakin way. Are you really willng to shoot an enemy more than 5 times to kill? I mean, you have no idea what you are talking about. You will waste all your ammo you will die over and over. I warned you.
---
The game is okay. Not as bad as some youtubers say. It's just that it's a buggy/unbalanced mess and what makes it worse is that people riot when Bethesda try to fix it. A real disaster of a game and community but I recommend you give it a try
---
Another thing is don't kick people in the middle of an op
---
If it has a little lightning bolt, it's energy, if it has a little bullet, it's ballistic.
---
All signs point to no.
---
I’m glad I got on before the Gutsy’s.  I can’t imagine if scorched get that buff, but I guess that’s why you always carry a melee
---
That's exactly how it works, but it's only really noticeable with level 3
---
Server hop. He'll have it in his inventory sooner or later.
---
I was thinking more like a style almost like a paint job in a different “visor” slot, cool idea though!
---
Very true, I do always have my Unstoppable Monster at the ready.
---
Fair enough. I’m still gonna pick it up but i’ll take your advice and if i’m not into it i’ll drop it. Thank you for advising me about this yonggo.
---
"true builds"? I thought the point of the entire system was to play the game however we want to, not the few specific ways some number crunchers somewhere worked out we should. Not to downplay their work ofc, but if so-called "true builds" exist, they should be presets right there in the game so everyone can pick and choose from those, and just do away with free customisation if it's gonna be - well, maybe not completely neutered (yet?), but certainly actively discouraged, anyway. Then we could avoid all this "crying".
---
If no one can give you a hand before tomorrow, I can build one in your camp for you. Just give me a shout if you still need one.
---
Bloodied Unyielding Stealth Commando/Rifleman, VATS mostly. Level 325.
---
   Damage per head shot with Commando on BFFR250 Handmade went from 1200 to 250. Enemies feel like they have less hp despite the higher level. 3 shots takes out a level 100 scorched. Q/50LD/25V Fixer took less of a hit. It takes 4 headshots on the same mob. Ammo use is higher, but only boss type mobs or packs are dangerous. Ammo use is offset with legendary ammo perk.
---
Rifleman side. B/50DR/15R Railway Rifle. This thing is the one shot king on non boss enemies. Using prime receiver. 2-3 headshots kills enemies in Daily Ops. In ops, you can farm spikes. Each kill drops as many as 20. I really wish it nailed body parts to walls like FO3. B2525 Plasma Rifle, Flamer Barrel with prime receiver. Didn't have it before the patch, i got it on the last day of the purveyor sale, but it feels like a huge buff over other flaming plasma I've tried pre patch. I'm guessing the fix for tank killer on energy weapons is responsible. You can see the rubberbanding of the enemy health bar people have been complaining about, but it's so overpowering, it doesn't matter. Huge ammo hog, but legendary ammo perk gives 424 ultracite cells per craft. Magazine capacity is 300.
---
I'm a little squishier. This isn't a bad thing. It gives a use for PA. I have a set of T65 with Emergency Protocols. The 50% straight damage reduction at 25% health gives solid survivability and bloodied damage output. This was my armor for ops with exploding mobs. Did not need fireproof.
---
My overall impression is good. I feel for low levels though. Your high level buddy can't pass on low level legendary equipment to you anymore because he can't get any. The struggle for ammo is real. I loaded into a level 5 alt and promptly got murdered by a scorched after shooting him 3x in the head with a bolt pipe rifle. While leveling this way will probably make you a better player, it will likely put off some new players.
---
I got a little wordy. I blame caffeine.
---
Legendary modules that I'm stockpiling because I'm so sick of being disappointed by SS armor rolls.
---
If you have zero imagination and don't understand how spiders work.
---
Better than the things I do to myself
---
I feel the same way. I have to repair my Chinese stealth suit at least once a day now
---
I had this happen like twice, but I was the one not joining daily ops. The first time I was pinned down by floaters and the second time I was overencumbered.
---
My point is, people who join daily ops teams are also still playing the game and don't necessarily have to drop what they're doing, especially if the daily ops are an hour or more apart.
---
And you activated it twice, right?
---
The assaultron with sentrybot minigun arms was a nice finisher in the first one - didn’t see that coming!
---
I only have one character. He's Level 312. Heavy Gunner/Rifleman build. Honestly, my playstyle has not changed with the update. I run around in power armor (The model depends on what I feel like running. Lately it's been T-60 with Jetpack. Normally I run T-51 or T-65 with med pump.)

---
Weapon 1: Anti Armor/Explosive Handmade. (My "Alright. Look here you little..." weapon. I'll normally pull it out if the laser rifle needs to reload, and I've got several bad guys in front of me I need to kill quickly.)
---
Weapon 2: Vampires Ultracite Laser Rifle (Uses ultracite fusion cells since there's not hardened receiver for laser guns in 76. Plus it made in batches of \~200 per flux before the update. I'll generally have this gun out when exploring or traveling the wasteland. The trick is to not fire as fast as you can; but to pace your shots, and land head hits for extra damage.)
---
Weapon 3: Vampires Laser Gat (This thing is amazing. No need for stims with it due to the number of rounds per minute. Power user gives me 1000 shots per full core. This has been my one of my primary weapons since a couple days before the update. I use it for West-Tek runs, Daily Ops.)
---
If I have a boss fight to deal with (ie Scorch Beast Queen or Colossal Wendigo), I'll pull out the level 50 Final Word .50 Cal. I have yet to try it since the update though.
---
1 - Build partial content.
---
2 - Ignore partial content and make more partial content.
---
3 - ???
---
4 - Bethesda!
---
I started playing the game in June, my main is lvl 130 or so, stealth commando (no bloodied or junkies or AA), I haven't had issues with the update. However my new lvl 18 has been struggling a bit. Especially below lvl 15 when you have no perks and your guns are just random junk you've picked up, you get wreaked by mole rats and scorched swarming you easily. The only easy part has actually been in the mine you go to for Crane's treasure, the enemies aren't as hard in there for some reason... I've transferred over a crafted shotgun, recon rifle, and raider PA, so it's much less difficult now.
---
But yeah, the game has definitely moved from "casual fun playground" to "survival game lite". It's not Dark Souls, but the early game isn't friendly as it was three months ago at least. I anticipate that the mid game (30-50 or so) will actually be better since you won't randomly be encountering high level enemies. (eg when I went to get the excavator power armor on my original character at lvl 36, the area was filled with lvl 52 Colonel Gutsys... for a lvl 25+ quest...)
---
When Todd throws you invisible bugged head laser bugged Gutsy. you just start swinging and hope it goes away
---
That’s the stuff that makes you a better player learn and become better
---
Oh FFS, if you remove every phobia from the game we would only play some Dora the explorer kind of shit. GTFO.
---
I have 410 carry weight, no bloodied perks. Its simple if you only carry the bare minimums
---
In general the timing is really off. Lots of half second freezing.
---
Appreciate it. I’ll be on for about another hour. Then I won’t be back until Monday since I’ll be working a double this weekend :)
---
Hahahahaha, yes indeed. I fell victim to doing that several times.
---
There's a difference between being dismissive and not agreeing with you.
---
Besides, the top few comment a right now are generally agreeing with you, albeit with caveats.
---
I can concur. It’s true. Every damned word of it. The game became a gane again. Not a romo around in god mode. And it’s far better for it
---
time to break out the wallet, my dude.
---
Ether your crying because you want it dead or your crying because laughing like a manic is normal
---
Sometimes people are ridiculous but many of the examples you have provided are valid criticisms of the game that should be complained about
---
I tried that, it isn't.
---
on the rooftop? there's access, but it's tricky to locate.
---
Not Likely
---
Yea I miss wearing outfits ever since I got the full ss set that's all I wear.
---
Bummer I can't get online sooner. If no one is able to come through, I will absolutely build ya one on Monday. :) Hope your double doesn't treat ya too rough, buddy.
---
Yea I was in first person an a team member kept walking in between me an the uplink stopping the activation like 3 times today
---
I tried sneak pre patch a little last week i was able to sneak attack some ghouls but it's inconsistent so for it to be consistent i reckon i'd need the sneak skill and ninja for damage perhaps but i heard sneak was inconsistent even with those skills, so i won't bother to use 6 skill perk points to try this. Honestly melee is a lost cause with the new addition damage system bloodied doesn't do anything and i tried the bench stack untill i had 80 strenght with +80 % buff with food stacked up +fury and overdrive and whiskey with party girl (+6 strenght) my damage went from 450 to 750 and against earl i dealt 70 on normal hits  or 300 in the headshot.
---
Yeah, I love vats with Commando or Rifleman. One perk in Concentrated Fire will allow you to target limbs. More increase accuracy. With shotguns, Enforcer under agility is king. An additional chance to cripple limbs.
---
Crippling legs is a good tactic for ghouls too.
---
I have like 100+ blood packs and like 1000+ stims on a mule. I just can’t bring myself to drop them or sell them. I also spam the shit out of them in fights. Plus apparently 117 disease cures. I stock pile the shit out of chems even if I never use them.
---
Thank you man. Have a good night!
---
Just... how?
---
'I run bloodied build'
---
so you're chock full if mutations
---
' hunter's explosive gatling gun '
---
cause everyone's got one of these layin around and the ammo to burn
---
' Piece of cake. Just needs more ammo '
---
yeah cause you used a heavy stagge gun that auto fires and has a stagger aoe affect a well
---
some peoples complaints are they don't have decent weapons or mutations cause their gameplay beforehand was millin about as a casual .. look at a lot of the posts .. one person even mentioned using a non-legendary 1 handed melee weapon .. but they liked the look
---
also most other guns/melee weapon don't provide such a high stagger rate
---
minigun is already a nice stagger mixed with explosive which is also a stagger and aoe
---
2h melee requires a heavy attack for a stagger which eats ap and isn't even a cleave .. and they need dodgy more than ranged ppl do also the legendary melee perk requires the use of vats to actually be of use (cleave)
---
ap expenses combined with low stagger weapons and low damage allows enemies to mindlessly run at them and chew em up .. if they are casual and use already non legendaries or even some legendaries didn't build for damage they sure as shit didn't build for defense, they're just a run of the mill casual which this game has a high frequency of
---
they couldn't kill stuff quick before the patch .. both due to the way they play and due to the fact they don't build a spec for anything specific and now they're in even worse trouble
---
tldr: the dilemna I think on most of these peoples minds is they either have to change their gameplay and be forced more into paying attention to meta and offense/defense than to play how they want .. socializing, building, scavenging, running around aimlessly not caring about legendaries etc
---
Does anyone have video proof of this or are people just speculating?
---
It's basically the equivalent of bloody mess in the old games. Fun but useless
---
I’m sorry man, almost happened to me once, but the nuke was poorly placed so I was in Chinese stealth armor and managed to run away
---
Yay, I had the broken one, repaired it and it didn't require me to get the third!
---
What would be cool is to see those bosses out in the wasteland. Wanna take over a workshop? Defeat one of those bosses with his crew guarding it.👍
---
Right now, I login, do a FT lap of the map to certain locations checking for rare spawns i'm after, also checking player vendors, do the daily op, get my caps/scrip/gold daily limits, do any daily challenges not completed when doing the previous tasks, quick cleanup of inventory at camp + replenishing vendors, log off.
---
Takes about 1-2 hours depending if any nukes/interesting events happen during that time.
---
Then I go play another game.
---
Yawp. I get the "laughing like a maniac" a lot since what Im laughing about and swinging wildly at has been dead for a while, lol
---
Do please explain the thing with uplink. I don't have notifications except repair/turn_on the device (forgot the action) that happens usually quite fast (or it's not so fast in the team mode? I've never do devices myself) and clean the area. What the idea with staying near uplink?
---
Too many tacticool people in the fallout community. I started in 3 and outfits like Naughty Nightwear and Blast off Pajamas were what I associated these games with. Nexus mods disagrees.
---
Good point!
---
What's the high tech bench???
---
I play on pc &amp; tbh the game is pretty much identical on every platform maybe try getting an HDR capable screen or consider getting one of the higher end consoles (or a gaming pc) it should get a next gen update so theres that too
---
Which system?
---
Also rank 16, I’m loving the new season. It’s way less stressful. I was constantly worried about it, now I just play because the exp is so easy to come by.
---
Wow, just had to brag about your high tier shit tho didnt you?
---
The legendary run challenges (non nw) generally take me about 90 minutes, if I play more than that I’m usually just exploring and enjoying/hating that all events take some effort now. (Mostly enjoying)
---
I do that sometimes but I recently switched to bloodied for a bit
---
There's some bullshittery from the olden days, and people would often lose their perks or not be awarded perks they picked, according to numerous threads from ~ a year ago. I imagine you may have been a victim of that. It also depends on how many different perks you're keeping for yourself. 
---
I'm at level 303. After scrapping all the cards I didn't need, I came to 636 perk coins (450 of which I used on getting the Legendary Strength, Perception, and Charisma perks to level 3). All of the perks I have equipped plus all of the perks I have saved equal 380 perk coins in value, with 65 perk ranks currently equipped and 125 perk ranks sitting in backup. So after 303 levels, I've collected 1,016 perk coins in value, and I'd estimate I've spent ~30 level-ups on moving stats around. To get the remaining 1,164 points I need, I need about 324 levels, which would put me at level 627 by the time I'm done. So, for me, the math works out almost perfectly. You should check to see how many spare perks you're holding onto. My estimate of level 650-700 was based on my own playstyle, so it may vary for you depending on how many perks you want to keep.
---
It helps that I've installed the auto-lube function in my armor...I come out smooth and supple as a baby's bottom.
---
I just want to see the progression.   If lvl 68 super mutants have 700 hp, why do lvl 100 have over 2300?
---
Correct, and I have been unable to find it twice now, and have spent hours looking.  I did finish the quest with advice on just repairing the broken one, but damn I'm frustrated.
---
There's one sitting unused in the game files. "Cut throat" I think? Lev wears the outfit that goes along with it.
---
Good to hear you're adapting. Nukes and Dragons  build planner is a invaluable tool. Sneak and agility are key. Just know its gonna be tough as the sniper builds were hit hard by the changes. Learn all you can about your perk card choices and don't be afraid to ask questions.
---
Feels better if it’s one of those “totally legit non wall hack 100% working dupe glitch” enemies
---
Yes sir it dose effect it
---
I don't have any experience with South Korea, you only asked about my knowledge of systems outside of my experience. And I know for a fact that in South Korea at least their standard past middle school goes through the roof as they fight to attend college. While that's the extreme case, the incentive comes from mostly the poor parents working hard to put their kids through a 14 hour school day.  Yes Korean students spend almost 14 hours a day in school. Contrary to the belief people have that all they do is play league of legends all day.
---
I can go and write an essay about how a Korean high schooler's life compares to that of an American student's life. The learning, and viewpoint on academia is greatly different in where Korea cares too much, and America cares way too little.
---
Xbox
---
Imagine having a communist sanctum at your CAMP.
---
The report on youtube I saw was quoting reddit posts. Now I am quoting the youtuber, and the circle is complete.
---
Melee should be allowed to use concentrated fire, and also the groin should be a valid target area so you can go around punching mutants in the nuts
---
I would like more Raider outfits and helmets, like the welder's mask. Vault outfits too, not just a skin that turns something else blue and yellow. Something like the Vault Utility outfit from 3, or lightly armored vault outfit (or heavily armored too), the Vault Security outfit/armor, Vault Outfit with Tunnel Snake jacket, and so on and so on.
---
Yes! I agree!
---
It’s worth just for faring ultracite rounds.
---
However, if I am in casual and you start a daily op you are probably on your own
---
Can’t wait to cause a bloodied mess to the next one I see
---
Its a role playing game. Role is in the description. If someone wants to the the role of the idiot caravan and not have any damage perks and only spec the weight carrying perks they should be allowed to, and are allowed to. If someone wants to play the gardener then they can. But they shouldnt complain that its too hard for them when they chose that role, its and rpg for a reason, people just want to take the role out of it
---
It was a no-brainer for me as I have a porch on my 2nd floor. Put it right outside the door and provides a great ambience.
---
I can add you in 5-10 to do it
---
I’m unoptimizable and other than needing a few more bullets I’m not having any issues.
---
And,  thanks to the ammo match the bullets I use are basically replenished.
---
It’s a good example of a microcosm of the world today ... at least as far as the US goes.
---
This is interesting and seems to be possibly true! I took off the suppressor perk  and my damage was increased. Maybe its just me (or op) but it does seem true.
---
Haha, make sure to have that bad larry of a perk equipped.
---
That's how I would want all helmets with visors should be
---
I know it’s concentrated fire, I use that for v.a.t.s. What I’m saying is after I kill an enemy, gun fu Targets the next enemy. Sometimes I don’t want the next to me so I’ll swivel around and see what’s closer or what’s going on and then target them...but if gun fu swaps targets for me...me manually pressing the D pad changes where I’m targeting on the enemy
---
Me be is jss125
---
I think I was wearing the steel dawn fatigues SS backpack and Marine armor helmet
---
100%
---
I'm trying to get my buddy into the game, we're he's 23 and I'm 25, and we're getting our asses handed to us. Every encounter now is a major battle- I had to put PA on to fight the dogs near the Wayward, and it kinda makes a certain quest nearly impossible. 🙄
---
I think headshots matter more than builds/gears now. A headshot from a shitty weapon and a shitty build absolutely outperform bodyshots from some min/max builds. So you have to shoot better now. That's how you should play
---
Can’t forget Enforcer so you can break their legs while your at it!
---
Just got the Symptomatic schematic tonight from Daily Ops!
---
Staying with the uplink makes the uplinking go faster.  
---
Since it's a timed event, it helps to get it done in under 8 minutes. (best time)
---
Wordy posts are a good thing. Seeing posts from users that are doing ok with the changes will help those struggling.
---
It applies to framerates too btw.
---
60fps is a frame every 16 (and change) milliseconds.
---
30fps is a frame every 32 (and change) milliseconds.
---
These figures directly relate to input latency.  (delay between pushing a key and the results being reflected on the screen).
---
so frequency often has direct impact on latency.
---
The same occurs with server tickrates, a 20hz tickrate would have the appearance, of an average of approx 25ms of additional network latency.  (the average of the experienced latency is approximately half the refresh frequency).
---
I was wearing mountain scout and space helmet
---
That's for a shotty. I used One Gun Army with the 50 cal. The stopping power that gun has with that perk is on is nutty.
---
I run AAE combat with 3 commando perks and have not problem at all.
---
On XBox so maybe the dupes are different.
---
Ok, thanks for the info! I tested it with rank 3 and it worked!
---
It feels unbalanced ... especially with something like the defend your workshop event. Had one that was a single wave of rad rats ... super easy. Another was three waves of ghouls ... slightly harder than it used to be. 
---
The last was three large waves of Mirelurks ... it was brutal, went from 40 stimpacks to 10. Used my heaviest weapons and it was still taking longer to kill the mirelurks, kings and whatever the crawfish looking ones are than it takes to down a scorchbeast. It was ridiculously resource intensive to hold on to the workshop ... it wasn’t hard per say, but just felt like a waste of time on an enemy that shouldn’t be brutally difficult.
---
Ah I think the guy I was with had the captain cosmos PA if I remember correctly
---
Oh ok
---
Not everyone is looking for that kind of experience. Now that's the only way to play. Calm exploration and reclaiming of the forest is no longer an option, because you can round the corner and get mauled by dogs.
---
I don’t know where I got this idea but I read somewhere that the animated perk cards would give more perk coins when scrapped but they don’t seem to
---
Hey little guy, there's some real assholes out there, go play minecraft and dun worry about fallout just yet, ya hear
---
Yea on PC most players have a little of everything because of the duping. I remember a while back a vender was selling a few trillion large handmade presents for 1 cap each like it's just ridiculous. That guy was thankfully banned long ago but there still are many others just as ruthless as him.
---
Underrated truth. Mutant slayer went from pretty much a bad joke since all I ever wanted it for was west tek, into a prefix that I am actively interested in keeping
---
Deathclaws are what does it for me, but getting them to pose is the hard part.
---
Don’t listen to that guy .. I bet he sucks butt lol but I do recommend you search the different builds so you have an idea of which perk cards you should be getting early on . The game has had soo much content dropped in since its release and is definitely worth picking up now
---
You need to rework your perks to fit specific enhancements on damage output of specific weapons. And it makes sense to play this way because it's more engaging on working your strategy game. No more autopilot and that makes the game much more alive.
---
For instance get the three tiers of rifleman maxed out and you'll see that damage scale return on all non automatic rifles.
---
Welcome to classic fallout.
---
Part of the appeal of FO76 was the mini game of working perk cards for extra benefits.  We spent hours and hours building up an arsenal of perk cards and even more hours learning how to use them.  Those that learned it best became very powerful, and rightfully so.  You gotta pay to play.  Now, many perk cards that were once powerful are just routine, or even worse.  The beloved quest for power through perks is nearly worthless.  Even worse, at least IMO, is the fact that this new additive mumbo jumbo has made it very hard or impossible to predict exactly what these perks even do anymore.  Ninja for example says "2.xx damage while sneaking" yet it only adds 13% at level 3.  Hardly even worth the 3 perk slots.  Many others are neutered in the same fashion.  
---
It is reasonable that many people who devoted such time and effort into obtaining and learning about these perk cards and how to use them are a bit depressed and disappointed.  It was a big nerf, not in terms of being able to kill as much as being able to use perks to greatly improve damage.  There is a big difference in the feel of annihilation versus the present norm of barely getting the job done.  There is a certain amount of fun factor that has just vanished.  Melee in particular feels weak and unsatisfying.  Considering the grind many people endured to get to a point where they felt a certain satisfaction in having an edge through hard work and study, it is reasonable that some are not happy with the new changes.  As for me, the changes feel poorly implemented and not thought through and I hope Bethesda will soon refine the damage system and restore some perks that are clearly not working as advertised.   I'm not jumping on the whole "Cancel my FO1 and uninstall" bandwagon just yet, but some things do need attention and soon.
---
There's always tomorrow
---
Personally, I think it would be really cool. But spiders seem to be a hill a lot of developers just don’t want to die on. They know it will upset people. 
---
That said, they could do what Obsidian did with Grounded and put them in but also add an accessibility setting that makes them look like blobs for the people who can’t deal with seeing them. If One Wasteland can recognize your level and show you different stats, stands to reason it could recognize an accessibility toggle and show you a different design too.
---
I run X-01 PA with medic pump and the only issue I have is Poison damage. Medic pump keeps me from dying though, Earle has tried many times.
---
Awesome! Killer-Soldier1
---
ok thank you for the advice!
---
Maybe we’ll get lucky and it’ll be in the bullion shop. Wish they’d tell us that before the seasons over though
---
Regs sells all 4 of them for 200 gold bullion each. There's Fire, Cryo, Plasma and Electric mods.
---
Resilient crickets. Trying to melee those bastards would make me quit for the day.
---
Added!
---
I want it to drive the Rockhound with drills like in A Colossal Problem.  Then walk out in Excavator Armor with the Fatman.
---
Scorched bloated glowing diseased tarantulas. Hell yeah.
---
Exactly! It would be so awesome to run around in my power armor with a chainsaw lol
---
Non pvp players complaining have ruined pvp as well, simply because they get destroyed by other players who have characters built around pvp. Please don't ask for changes to pvp unless your an actuall pvp player.
---
Lasers are light, light is electromagnetic radiation, and so lasers are electric.
---
Not only the antiarmor effect, but perks like tank killer too. 
---
Armor penetration is more important than raw damage, at least today.
---
Functionally it makes no difference.
---
If your client doesn't receive the intermediate data, then for you, the "apparent" tick rate is your perceived tickrate.
---
I guess it could be argued that there is a benefit to asymetrical tickrates, however I suspect if you calculate it out; and compare the results, the "apparent" tick rate, would be the average between server and network tickrate.  (at best).
---
So if you have a 20hz update rate, and a server running at 60hz, then your perceived tickrate would probably be *at best* 40hz.  It would in reality feel like something between 20 and 40.
---
For me, the only complaint I have, is that the obvious balance issues created by level 75-100 mobs and level max 45-50 weapons and armor with nullified perk multipliers will INEVITABLY be solved by increasing the MAX level of.the Weapons and Armor to levels 70-75, and have all the players grind out NEW top level gear.
---
So get on with it ..... up the MAX level on the weapons and armor and let US, the players, get on with earning legitimate rewards for killing the harder mobs and bullet sponges in front of us with NEW gear that actually has some value.
---
An optimized build would mean getting rid of all the weight perks and that’s basically impossible
---
I just want my 10mm to be able to kill things with less than 35 bullets again.
---
I noticed the enemy buff and damage nerf for sure even with my perfect gear. I'm not really having any trouble with it and I wouldn't complain, but I see how others are going to struggle and that sucks.
---
Tank Killer is a rifle perk.
---
It's a package deal.
---
Actually - was he using a flamer? I swear I saw him using some assault rifle...
---
And a big vault tec logo on his forehead that you can stab with a sword
---
Vaporizing a human beings head into a bloody mist is fine but they can't deal with spiders? Some people really have issues and the fact another game turns spiders into a blob is pathetic. Some people are afraid of clowns but you don't see anyone crying about that freaky clown painting in 76.
---
That’s probably it. I run it at all times, and I can’t remember the last time I had to repair it. Of course, I do spend a solid amount of time in my solar armor, so that probably helps.
---
Low blood sugar levels gets you into [places](https://imgur.com/wjjcpfT)
---
Uh I had guns that felt more than 60 damage at level 17 how do you not
---
Thanks dude and it comes from all types of things. Psychological issues. He probably hates himself, that’s why I don’t even dwell on it.
---
You're right, it was some variety of rifleman Weapon, probably the base assault rifle skin, but the projectiles behaved like the old new vegas incinerator
---
And while youre at it please stop making stairs only attach to the middle of a floor or foundation.
---
Early game go melee if you have problems with ammo, until you get to level 50ish then respec into whatever you want.
---
Was finally able to get the key off of Caleb Fishers body but it took a bit of out glitching the glitched mission. For some reason every enemy but Surge was loading into the dungeon inside of Levs locked door. I noticed their weapons sticking out if the door and walls and was able to kill them. All it took after that was exit the dungeon and enter again immediately for Calebs body to respawn up agains the wall again with his weapon hand sticking out and allowing me to loot the key. 
---
I hope this helps you find the key cause I know how shitty it feels to not be able to progress the story.
---
With the latest update, it was supposed to apply to pistols.
---
Yeah no Bethesda can suck on my empty wallet
---
I mean if you want I can do a level 20 west tek run just give me a couple days to make a new character and get them level twenty and I’ll happily oblige
---
It affects all of the gauss weapons.
---
It doesn't stack for me
---
I can get usually all the dailies for those days and then finish most of the weeklies
---
Gotta love high strength. Shotgun to Heavy gun to Carrying you, your friends and the rest of the games trash
---
Alright. If i were to choose a melee weapon what would be your recommendation
---
There is a way to glitch in there with the mole miner, just like I glitched into the room the purveyor is in
---
Nope. Used to be 1 - 2 shot kills now 3-4 shot kills. Commando build is all the same. I use Improved a Repair kits from SBQ, so I don’t see the difference.
---
Haven’t gotten a request yet
---
Fuck me to tears same thing happened to me, and the worst part? If you kill Surge and then Fisher the key still does not spawn on Surge.
---
Thanks, that is news to me.
---
You know, I thought I saw that, but I figured I was just hallucinating. Thanks for confirming that I am not insane.
---
Yep, you’re screwed.
---
so basically you just bitched and moaned about people bitching and moaning. you played yourself
---
I’ve gotten it as even reward but I can’t remember which one or what region...:/
---
Well, I mean, due to covid-19 there's not going to be Halloween IRL either, so I guess they're just making FO76 relevant to real life.
---
Me too. Cool CAMPs are one of the reasons I like playing. Seeing what people come up with.
---
I started out with just a few benches in my camp, to a 2 story house with a porch and a man cave. I never thought I would be into it either but I was inspired by other camps as I was grinding.
---
It's up to you, no one would judge/shame you for a small camp. Some of the smallest camps I've been too have had the best stuff.
---
Honestly whatever you can get your hands on.  Imo don't worry much about much until you get to 50, you'll have access to all the perks* and will be able to figure out what to do.
---
lol fair enough.
---
Thanks for asking this.  I always assumed explosive meant explosive.
---
Time to get some new cards...
---
Thanks this will help a lot!
---
What's ur commando build? If you don't mind me asking haha
---
No, the mental drive to progress is the same.
---
What is gone is the *fear of missing out* by not participating for a day.
---
I still haven't played since completing the score track.  I have absolutely NO desire to even start the next SCORE track, since the previous one made me feel so awful.
---
Still haven't gotten the magic drop. RNGesus still hates me.
---
The chainsaw should be one of the strongest melee weapons in the game
---
I got you...give me ur gt and I'll invite to my world
---
I don't think there are that many. The only other ones I can think of are the Nuka Cola paints, shielded operative under armor, artillery and shrouded wood armor. Maybe there's some others I'm forgetting.
---
That’s what I share. I love flying through the air and floating with all my mutations. It’s a simple enjoyment of grinding in the game. Marsupial makes it even better
---
Hey, are you going to buy it on pc?
---
You’re awesome! Thanks
---
@WestRider85
---
I will pay attention to the uplink part of the event, because I don't think I remember it takes more than several seconds even in the team of the four or three we were able to do it under 8 minutes.
---
Nah, i’m gonna pick it up on PS4
---
The lever is still viable. You need an instigating one, stealth and tank killer. 
---
I am still oneshooting almost everything. But, again, you need the instigating one. My bloodied was causing very little Damage.
---
Question - is it better than cryo arrows?
---
The red asylum dress has a spawn rate of 0.01% or a chance of 1/3000. The outfit has a 5% chance to drop. Incorrect sir.
---
Yea. Killer-Soldier1
---
Today I started a new team and had 3 others immediately join me. I waited a few minutes... started an op.
---
Start to finish all by myself. Why join the team if you have no interest?
---
I left the team and left the server after that - what's the point?
---
Okay, I would help you, but I play on pc
---
Yup...pretty much killed the sneak rifleman build. Nerfthesda wants everyone to go commando or heavy gunner.
---
TBH I liked it how it was.  Sure, it had problems but it was still quite useful.  Now all my stuff is stuck in the walls and I have less space.  I can't be bothered to fix it so it just looks stupid for now.
---
How about no
---
Meet at 76
---
oh allg!
---
On my way!
---
I wouldn't say more difficult, but rather the One Wasteland aspect of the new patch made it to where it takes less bullets to kill enemies.
---
If you need me to build it for you I can.
---
Criticisms regularly get thousands of updates. I don't know what subreddit you're reading, but it ain't this one.
---
+karma glad to help out
---
Marsupial changed my gameplay, i dont think im able to play without it now
---
I think some of what people are missing here, are the posts swearing that they’ll quit because of this update. I still see people who are around this sub but haven’t logged in for days, so they’re not going anywhere.
---
&gt; I truly wonder if that is actually legal to change the item I have bought...
---
You didn't buy an "item". It's a live service game, the rules are different for those.
---
It's fun to chase ppl in workshops with it
---
Tried again
---
I love melee and have or had an optimized high level bloodied unarmed build. I could devastate almost anything. Now, I am doing about 1/6th of the pre patch damage. Seeing low double digit numbers against Earle was almost my breaking point. I have reduced my play time as I just don't have the energy to grind a new build and gear.  If they don't adjust unarmed base damage, I fear it may be time to move on to another game.
---
I asked my magic 8-ball and it said "You're serious?" then it laughed at me. 
---
Now the 8-ball is one with the drywall.
---
What is this high tech bench.
---
I have found even using my TS Lever to be troublesome. It gets the job done, but I miss the one shot capability. 
---
I have been using the Cursed Harpoon with fletchette mod. One shots in VATS and can loot the ammo off corpses. Slow reload though.
---
I'm sorry friend.  I'm level 500 but I think you have a very valid point.  The game got a lot harder for low levels.  Not sure that is a wise decision by Bethesda.
---
I’ll add you. What’s your psn
---
I was gonna say PornHub but you pretty much summed it up.
---
But I need a bunch of weight reduction perks at all times just to exist
---
anyone here can tell you its clear the devs dont actually play the game
---
Halloween in the real world is gone this year now I won’t have a chance to get the items I missed on the last events. Great. Thanks again Bethesda!
---
They always reminded me of the Ghost People from Dead Money, would be cool if there is a lore connection we could learn.
---
As good as the adventure mode XP is that'll be my time to hit up NW. Less time required in that mode while unlocking the next Inferno power armor paint.
---
The Scoreboard. As you advance in rank you get Atoms. You can get up to 2000 Atoms over the next 9 1/2 weeks. 
---
Also the other challenges can still provide Atoms, like missing weapons, claiming workshops, etc. Check those to see what’s available.
---
This is why I enjoy the fact I can solo that shit on my toons
---
Miscreated had some giant spiders that were pretty fun to fight.  They would spawn little spiders that would run over to you and blow up.  Kinda like the Mirelurk Spawn.  
---
I'd be down.
---
The communist collectron in Revolutionary harvesting mode produces lots of blood packs.
---
(Also, hi! I was replying anyways because I had something useful to say, and as I started to, I recognized your name from playing with you today! I’m Glitter, we did a daily op in 9:10 or so. I know it sounds like such an implausible coincidence, I promise I’m not stalking you or something!) But yeah, communist collectron is my main source of stimpack crafting; I get maybe 3-5 blood packs every time I check it if it’s reasonably full.
---
Do you actually get a day off work for it like is it an actual holiday?
---
Same i’m level 25 and not really fallout skilled so now this is extremely difficult and takes the fun out of the game. I just want a casual play
---
Probably not because "earning atoms for just playing the game!" is becoming less and less of a reality as time goes on. I wonder how long until "all dlc will be free!" will be next on the chopping block.
---
My favourite is loading into a world and it saying someone is already in your spot when there's no camp around for miles.
---
You forgot Master Legendary Infiltrator Scorched Bloated Glowing Diseased Tarantulas.
---
 was using my explosive tesla, worked good
---
Yeah, pretty much the only things in reviews i look for are when they say stuff like "hasnt been uodated in months, devs have given up" to all the early access games which is a notorious problem on steam with early access
---
Full ss uny, you level up faster and can get More coins, nothing changue
---
I didn’t play for most of the summer , came back the last week that was x2 points and got halfway across the board
---
Yeah maybe, might be worth having a nose through some of the complainers post history to see if it is the same people or not
---
I'll have to snag it. Thanks!
---
Also, lovely to be able to converse through words rather than emotes! Thank you so much for visiting my C.A.M.P., I'm glad you liked it!
---
I've been doing this for ultracite cores 2 to 4 per run works great lol
---
This is most annoying with the minigun that have to spin up. I'm constantly letting off the trigger and the mob still has a sliver of health left.
---
Got the plan and unlocked but when I try to build in my camp, still shows locked. Why man, why.
---
Haven't messed with those.
---
Oh cool, thanks
---
Yea, I have a TSE combat Shotty. That gun used to be good.
---
I bloody love dogs, where we live (in a flat)with our lifestyles (I'm a nurse) it would be cruel. So we just have the cats.... and a good drink is great way to relax on a weekend :)
---
16x the detail.  *crys in fallout 4 engine
---
Exactly.  The opposite is just as annoying. Apologists who get angry at the slightest hint of criticism. Someone can have a critique and still enjoy the game.  It's not like this game is perfect. While a lot of bugs have been fixed,  a lot have gone on way too long ( like the nuclear winter cheaters) 
---
All in all.. neither extreme is good.  Enjoy the game,  but don't glorify it.  Likewise,  criticism is good, but unconstructive attacks are unproductive.
---
Survival Shortcut negates so many QoL perk picks. Two points in it at most and you’ll never need food, water or nuke quantum ever again.
---
Todd didn't even make me a coffee this morning!
---
-1000/10 Game D R O P P E D
---
I haven't died losing it yet. I think it leaves you at 1hp no matter what, cause the same happens to my friend who is a low hp melee.
---
Same about carrying alcohol. I try to keep one of each for his quests.
---
It's also fun for meat week. Chasing the critters, making a mess splattering blood, and running around like Leatherface.
---
&gt;robots are a non problem
---
&gt;blood eagles and super mutants are slightly worse
---
you what now
---
errr, you could have gotten the chinese armor and side with raiders...
---
What I think would be better would be a button to hide player icons on the map. It's a pain to travel to a popular event. No, i don't want to be friends with J2445433e!
---
Especially assaultrons.  Those are the easiest
---
😂😂 but imagine pet spiders at your camp, that would be adorable!
---
Last double xp was mid July.
---
We really gotta wait until December?
---
Seems like we got them more often in the past
---
I have a BE gatling and I seemed to get 700-800 rounds on completion in addition to what I picked up off enemies. I was coming out with more ammo than I went in...
---
oh. the electric charged perk. right.
---
You are my fucking hero!
---
Wireshark.
---
Because Bethesda doesn't give a shit about you
---
Ding ding ding, we have a winner
---
That seems more reasonable!
---
I think it just needs serious tuning. I havent gotten past 38 with this game and I was excited that I could finish quests in the more difficult areas, but im dismayed that everywhere I go even in the lower places enemies are 38 and ghouls are taking 4 headshots to bring down.
---
No. Fuck no. The cave crickets and ticks are close enough, I was just telling my friend how grateful I am that of all the things to make into big irradiated monsters fallout left out spiders. 
---
Unless they make them not very realistic, like the spiders in WoW never bothered me to much but the ones in bloodborne was the first (and so far only) time a game made me actually shriek in fear for a moment. Leave spiders the fuck out
---
Go into the parking garage and then up the stairs at the edge. IIRC, that will take you to the roof.
---
They're in Vault 79
---
About the same
---
**stomps foot adamantly and points again** RIGHT NOW, BUSTER! You will NOT speak to me with those words from your mouth like that again!
---
I believe you can get any ammo back on kill except for cores, missiles, and mini-nukes(you just have to be near them and have the weapon equipped but yes, including ultracite, grenades, and even AB rounds). Though, I think it's possible to get cores back on completion of the op. I haven't tested it out but I heard it's possible. It depends on the ammo type of the weapon you're holding when the boss dies. It's usually about 200 rounds on completion.
---
It happens sometimes. You can actually delete the floating wires themselves. Just aim at them, you should be able to highlight them. And just scrap them.
---
Had all these before the patch. some are hilarious.
---
Yessssss I love that idea! The honeybeast is one of my favorite creatures in fallout 76 hands down. I like the trap door idea though, they could be more deadly radscorpions? The mire ones would even freak me out but it would make it a whole lot more scary than just having pure atmosphere to freak people out.
---
You need a brewing table from doing Biv's quest, but yeah, it takes the usual stuff + Earle's sack.
---
Bad rng, I got two rare rewards today
---
Yeah but they don’t really trigger the same response for some reason
---
/thread 
---
10/10
---
Wait, firecracker whiskey wasn't actually implemented? I've been getting increasingly pissed each time I complete his dailies because I never get the recipe.
---
Brewing for all alcohols. Quest takes maybe 30 min.
---
They have to be warlords and alpha too!
---
Wasn’t too sure I tried to look into things to see if anyone had seen this issue before but couldn’t find anything so I figured I’d post it to see if I could get answers. That makes sense.
---
i loved the yellow super mutants. makes me wish that all super mutants were yellow
---
The SCORE bug  where the meter goes through every freaking rank needs to go away fast. Super-annoying.
---
Sounds like an easy ass way to stock up more rounds for my gauss once I finally get a roll I like. Good shit
---
Telling you, that jetpack can be a lifesaver now!
---
I'm like 90+ but made all events and side stories except nuke and colossal. I like stuffing the blue suitcase at the WSS with different stuff like */** legendaries, low level guns and armor (though, it's hard to get).
---
maybe a mecha mole miner at the ash heap?
---
That’s... not very good then. I never noticed the slow down when using my bows.
---
yeah, i LOVE the garage, it's just hard to get it level with the ground. So yeah i'd love this.
---
Very upset about the weapon (NURFING AGAIN).
---
My 2 sons and I quit the game when this was done in the beginning. I'm the only one playing again from my family and wasted money in the atomic shop for this to happen again. Very Angry.
---
I understand your frustration. But you aren’t being forced to wear PA. Believe me. I was an unarmed build since beta. Eventually became bloodied. And then I also swapped out some perks here and there whenever I got bored of punching stuff and decided to rock shotguns or heavy guns. 
---
Now that enemies have been buffed, and we do less damage, I still run around with my unyielding armor. Sure I die here and there, but not as often as you think. Take a good look at your perks. Make sure you have blocker to reduce melee attacks. I don’t know what your build is, but put on some damage reduction perks, make sure you have a good set of armor. And make sure you are not wearing the high capacity book bag, since that makes you weaker.  
---
The ONLY time I get in power armor is when I play around with heavy guns. Because one of the perks only works while in power armor. Other than that, I run around punching things.
---
level 25, walking into a building with 10 feral ghouls all level 25 and I have a pump shotgun that does \~10% of their health per shot.
---
I die probably once or twice an hour of play and thats mostly from avoiding engagements
---
New players will never experience again being level 20 and trying to do a main story mission in the Savage Divide, and max level enemies are in the area because a higher level player looked at the zone. The was a little more difficult, meaning you'd need to server hop to even have a chance of closer level enemies.
---
I thought that maybe the criticism of lower levels was true, but seeing Angry Turtle kill max level enemies with a non-legendary auto pipe rifle in 1 second, I'm not thinking the criticism for the game being harder is so true.
---
Getting same here on pc.  When I get on it crashes on fast travel.  I lost 2000 lead and 8000 steel trying to transfer to another toon.  Fucking weeks worth of ammo gone.  Soooo frustrated right now.
---
2nd day I have done daily ops with randoms and finished just over 6 minutes. Is nice !
---
Pvp
---
I went in with 26,472 shotgun shells. And after I looted all the enemies and got my rewards , I ended up with 26,936.
---
I'm with ya, I saw some youtuber for a build that said not to use if you had a dedicated crafting character but saw that he equipped master infiltrator max rank.
---
So basically just another QoL perk replacing a QoL perk no ty.
---
I'm on a semi-new character who's level 44, no legendary gear. i'm doing just fine. its great in fact.
---
Part of me wants to restart again to do the early bits with the great new damage model.
---
honestly for casusals they shouldnt have to change tbh. for the build community someone who spend 90% of their time working on there house who has no real interest in endgame why do they need an optimised build to gather resources?
---
Screwed by your mom heyyyyy.
---
Thank you. I had to scrap the wire then re login to get it to actually disappear
---
Stimpaks have never been a problem for me. I always used them the second I was crippled even though I run healing factor. I'd rather not wait for my limbs to regen. I'm more angry that speed demon has been inconsistent. Randomly seems to do way less for me even when I know I have mutated team mates.
---
its because you come off brash and are kind of dickish about it
---
Are you wanted?
---
Yeah it definitely can be done even if one person isn't in the uplink zone.
---
I noticed I was having trouble solo fighting until I managed my new perk cards it helped a lot I don’t die anymore unless I’m not paying attention and kill myself with my explosive guns
---
I’m assuming you meant to say their “camps” instead of calls. 
---
Do you happen to have a bounty on you by any chance? That’s the only explanation I can think of. 
---
When you have a bounty you can’t see any other players on the map or their camp. Unless they are your teammates.
---
Stimpaks aren't a problem for me anymore but then I first started this game they were gold to me.
---
&gt;I use 2x maybe 3x the ammo, everything degrades quicker.
---
Huh. I was farming Supermutants for XP today, and I'm still one-shotting everything with my ancient Bloodied/+10% Gauss rifle. Actually, even my "old faithful" Instigating hunting rifle one-shots everything that's weaker then lvl 100 mutants. I'm not seeing the increased ammo consumption, but that's because my build is laser-focused on killing things with as few shots as possible. I can imagine that less optimized builds would struggle.
---
That, is a fantastic idea.
---
This drives me absolutely fucking nuts. I sat in a team today for 15 minutes waiting for someone to start an op. Then I start it hoping they’d jump in, no such luck. I switch servers and it’s the same story.
---
Why in the actual hell would you just sit in an ops team and not play? I finish my op and I get out ASAP. Otherwise it’s just rude.
---
4chan is just the edgier version of reddit
---
When I originally heard about these grenades, and was excited because I thought I could throw these grenades, and the floater creatures would spawn from the blast, or it would attract floaters to that area. 
---
I was so disappointed.
---
I'm getting utracite cores back at completion of level - usually 4.
---
I should make some utracite 5mm &amp; see if I get that back from killed enemies
---
Sometimes I don’t bother picking up the ammo because I’ve done the event a couple of times and I’m over flowing lol
---
what does it even look like?
---
Really!! I got 3 stim packs!!
---
right so just accept everything so nothing ever gets changed.  got it.
---
That's because it's the only language and tone unreasonable complainers seem to understand. They don't want advice but instead a platform to bitch.
---
I just got chased around the Savage divide by a level 75 wolf! 😂
---
It's not always that they don't care, some bugs are just extremely difficult to fix since the engine is so rough lol.
---
I think i have to disagree about this would be bethesda actively trying to drive people away. They don't have to make it jump scary or anything like that, it could even be a good way to help conquer a fear of spiders seeing them in the wasteland!
---
The challenges aren’t really that bad. I’m a casual player playing only a few hours a week and still find myself completing the dailies and most of the weeklies. You can knock out the dailies (non NW) in about 5-10 minutes then focus on what you wanna do.
---
They are for pvp and the green ones work best from what I saw before the patch
---
That's for sure. Yesterday, a friend and I went into farm ammo and he walked out with over 1k 40mm grenades(usually 2-6 a kill). Shotguns seem to get a lot of ammo but for some reason, a lot of the drops I got for the ballistic rounds I tested(like .308 and .50) were barely anything. Most of the time, they would only average to around 9 rounds whereas shotguns averaged more around 16 rounds.
---
Like I had mentioned, since everyone is on a team, you only need to be near the enemy when it dies. If you're having trouble farming a specific ammo type, just equipped them weapon, camp in a room by the entrance, and let a friend kill everything(how I managed to get over 1k AB rounds).
---
Ah, that's why I've been hitting 0 or 1 HP lately. Big F.
---
They early game with no knowledge is such a different game from end game min max builds. The early game, mid game, and end game are all so different from each other. I honestly love all three experiences warts and all.
---
For Earl fights I recommend EMT to share.
---
Grinding I recommend Inspiration
---
Join a Charisma team for when you want to shop NPCs and share Magnetic Personality rank 2.
---
Strange in Numbers is a must, but if another teammate has it just share something else.
---
Other useful perks to share are Team Medic so that everyone has Stim's healing each other.
---
I don't share anything combat related because if the character wanted it they'd already have it, unless they're lower level or something.
---
The only two things I have to do is pay taxes and die.
---
&gt;we don't
---
don't we?
---
ps- 200 isnt that high
---
Yeah I feel like it would be nice to have heavy weapons revved up and ready to fire sometimes
---
play the new character as if you just bought the account
---
Yeah but that doesn't give as many atoms as doing the standard pre score challenges, before I could get enough to buy whatever I wanted from that weeks atomic shop but now it'd take till the end of this season to get enough and I think that's bullshit
---
F76 is a great community but my guy this is reddit.you just never know what you'll get. ..have an upvote
---
I dont think that's true of the Fallout community. Plenty of people love helping out lower level players.
---
Very free states of you. I like it
---
And breathe... don't forget to breathe, sir.
---
Bloodied stealth commando with uny ss armor and instigating explosive handmade. Update lowered damage but not to any great effect. Legendary perks added more damage which has offset it.
---
It's high on my standards, someone really shouldn't play the same game long enough to become a god
---
The only thing I do with grenades is lob them from my camp on top of Seneca Rocks.
---
Stopping breathing would be part of the dying I mentioned. 
---
Totally optional.
---
Rank gunsmith to level 5
---
This is very true..this is the only thing we cant avoid
---
Yes. I enjoyed my time running the four area looking for the plans for stimpaks and randomly getting healing factor. It was like becoming deadpool in fallout 😂😅
---
I agree. I played so much during season 1 to get to 100 and looking back, some of the stuff was nice but didn't feel like it was worth the mental stress to log in daily and do the same tasks everyday.
---
Ya know, it really is a good community.  That's why I hate to see a line being drawn between two sides.  The fact that there are many different opinions is a good thing, it opens up debate.  Too often I see others who are dismissive of the other side without good cause.
---
I laughed so hard at warped body glitch.
---
I'd expect so. There is really isn't much available in regards to poison damage/resistance so I can see it killing pretty easily. The blast radius of the grenades seem rather poor(visually at least).
---
The game is fun. Specially if you make some friends, or already have friends that play it. 
---
If you’re familiar with fallout 4, (the only fallout I ever played besides this one) then controls are pretty much the same. You’ll be able to customize your character, unlock different perks under each S.P.E.C.I.A.L skill tree. 
---
There are perks that benefit certain types of weapons. Increase your damage resistance. The damage you do. Your speed. Your sneak ability. Etc. 
---
A lot of different weapons to fit your fighting style. The game itself is fun. It can feel slow at first because You’re a low level. The quests and “story” is a little slow and easy to lose track off. But overall a good game. 
---
I won’t lie to you and say it’s the greatest game ever made. But it’s definitely worth playing. And if you don’t like it, it’s cool man. It’s not for everybody. 
---
You can customize your camp (your mobile home) you can place it down in many areas throughout the map. In order for you to build new stuff or unlock certain things, you can buy them with caps, complete events and have a chance to unlock rewards, or buy them from other players. 
---
The community here on reddit is pretty helpful with advice. And most questions are usually answers quickly. 
---
I must warn you, that the game recently got updated. And basically we do less damage, and enemies do a little more damage. Nothing crazy, it doesn’t make the game impossible to play. But figured you should know a lot of people will tell you to avoid this game because it’s ruined. It’s not. 
---
My tip is, go for bloodied weapons/ and unyielding armor. That means the lower your health, the more damage you do. The lower your health, the more bonuses you’ll get to your skills as long as you’re wearing unyielding armor. Don’t worry or stress too much about memorizing everything. If you’re a new player, you’re expected to die and fail and try stuff here and there. It’s part of the experience. 
---
You can always join a team with other people. They don’t have to be your friends. They can be temporary teammates.
---
you must be real fun at parties. if people dont warm up to you right off the bat you just become a huge asshole.
---
Ok, well cremation or burial is also mandatory.  So you've at least gotta make one more choice.
---
Grounded reduces the damage you deal with energy weapons. In return you get more energy protection. 
---
So yes, if you’re using any weapon that does energy damage. You’ll be doing less than other players who don’t have that mutation. 
---
Gatling gun. Tesla rifle. Laser rifles. Gauss weapons. Etc.
---
Thank you fabreeze1989!! This was very helpful!
---
I'm still on that strugglebus, kinda sucks, kinda used to it by now.
---
I haven't been able to upload a pic same bug but the guy is holding a giant gatling plasma and off to the side u cant see his head but you can see the white fedora.
---
I'll be dead. How am I gonna choose?
---
I suppose I could write a will and make a decision before my death. But I don't have to.
---
Im pretty sure I'm taking less damage aswell. As a level 230 Unarmed bloodied build normally I'd die often due to my aggressive playstyle and now im basically a tank
---
No, I prefer to be an asshole in response to moronic Reddit replies such as this.
---
I think I might have one and They aren't worth much
---
Build: Tanky stealth shotgun.
---
Level: 380.
---
Critical gear: Chinese Stealth Suit / Instigating combat shotgun / Vampiric combat shotgun
---
Observations: the legendary perks have pushed what was already a reasonably well-optimised full health build into something really quite formidable, and shotguns seem to perform exceptionally well against all enemy types so long as I’m in VATS and planting headshots. The weakening of certain damage effects -most noticeably sneak attacks- has led me to a much more aggressive, run and fun play style. This has suited the introduction of Daily Ops perfectly and whilst certain enemies are definitely tougher my damage output feels far more more consistent and fair. I’m honestly enjoying 76 quite a bit since patch drop, but I can sympathise with mid-level players who haven’t quite hit the perks and gear that are now a definite requirement to progress through the game.
---
Also wanted to add I am going to be sharing Mysterious Savior soon and put that up for share. Everyone having a good chance to revive stacked with everyone having EMT and that's some nice synergy.
---
On the load screen it says the complete opposite. False advertising perhaps but it says that even the frame alone will give you some armor resistance
---
Hahahahaaha, no. I'm poor, I work Christmas day if I'm scheduled.
---
I use stealth and all the right rifleman perks, still on the lookout for an instigating lever
---
If you want to increase the damage of a Gatling gun. And LMG. A 50 Cal machine gun. A 5mm minigun. A Gauss minigun. A plasma Gatling gun. Etc. 
---
You need heavy gun perks. Basically if your character is holding the gun like it’s big and heavy. Then it’s a heavy gun. When you equip those perk cards, you’re increasing the damage it does. 
---
HOWEVER. If one of those guns, has a legendary effect called “explosive” those perks will not boost the explosive damage AT ALL. It will boost the regular damage. But the explosive will stay the same. 
---
If you want to increase your explosive damage, then you need to pick a card under intelligence called “demolition expert”. 
---
And yes you can have heavy gunner perks, and the demolition expert perk at the same time. 
---
So now you’ll be increasing the heavy gun damage. And also the explosive damage.
---
Fuck... you're right, you don't have to.  You gotta shit though, right?  I mean, sure you can neglect food if you want, and that feeds into the whole death thing, but you at least gotta get rid of what you have in you at some point, right?
---
see proved my point i didnt warm up to you, you became an asshole.
---
Define not much? For the the outfit and head gear. Im just looking to wear it, not to resell. I am on Xbox
---
I didn't start having an easy time until I hit 100, and even now I struggle to do things w/o a team
---
Yes I remember the radius used to be bigger even when you use an explosive weapon but use the last laugh perk card with the poison Grenades and I’m from 617
---
Technically the minigun or most of them have a switch in real life to do this and when you actually want to start firing there is a separate switch/trigger. Or you can just use the trigger to get the barrels to speed and wait for it to load up. It’s a very complicating machine and has a lot of stuff that goes into it.
---
Chemist backpack.
---
Yeah I just love the situational versatility of the lever gun. I can snipe with it, win a fire fight, or clear a building all with the same gun.
---
Not struggle a bit.  You're being facetious.  You fail.
---
You’re welcome. See you out there.
---
I believe he was moved to the Berkeley springs station. Try checking there
---
Fuck. That.
---
Thank you!
---
No, this would just look like call of duty.
---
That's an involuntary bodily function. The decision isn't "to shit or not to shit", it's where to shit.
---
My main is unstoppable but my level 35 is going through 5.56 like crazy.just need to make it to 50
---
If you're using VATs, know that VATs for PvP broke after Wastelanders dropped and it won't do shit for ya.
---
Google "assassin's sentinel armor Fallout 76" because I have a feeling your opponent was wearing a full set.
---
If you want it I have a set
---
Another person who misunderstands the point. It happens every hundred upvotes you get one who gets whoooshed.
---
Haha yeah first time I got marsupial made me feel like a super hero.
---
It's a defense mechanism. I apologise. I'll do better and try to allow idiots to warm up before rejecting their idiotic replies.
---
No problem. I rarely go to Harper's Ferry but I've seen the question posted up a few times since the update. I don't believe it was in the patch notes though.
---
I was able to kill him through the wall by using vats. Also one of the boarded up windows has a gap in the upper right corner just big enough to shoot through. It took awhile but I was able to kill the raiders in the room this way and then leave and immediately run back into the dungeon so that the bodies respawn which caused the power armored raiser to stick out of the wall just enough for me to loot the key off of his corpse.
---
cheers!
---
Not sure on an exact  price but it's pretty common so I would pay much more than 2 k caps. And nvm chief I'm on ps4 can't do the trade
---
My issue is that when you have a shitload of meat piles in an event like Radiation Rumble, it crashes the everliving hell out of the game. I had this tonight even though my FPS was okay.
---
Busy?.. 
---
Log in...
---
Dailys...

Daily Ops...
---
Log off...

Get ready for work...

Carry extra weight for low lvls
---
Cheers!

I was just able to get the key off of Caleb Fishers body but it took a bit of out glitching the glitched mission. For some reason every enemy but Surge was loading into the dungeon inside of Levs locked door. I noticed their weapons sticking out if the door and walls and was able to kill them. All it took after that was exit the dungeon and enter again immediately for Calebs body to respawn up agains the wall again with his weapon hand sticking out and allowing me to loot the key.
---
I noticed today the hounds at west tek no longer drop glowing meat. Weird
---
Weird. I tried this with taking one for the team and a friend, it didn't trigger pvp
---
Don't think they are that delusional....
---
I played 76 since launch and never went back to farm against easier enemies... Because you get less exp and less resources/rewards. I needed help progressing a few times and found people to do so. It's on online game, that's how it works and it's easy. Now with public teams, it's even easier to find help. Since I had my shit figured out, my end game has been helping new players. I struggled to adjust for a few days after last patch and have gone back to the same MO.
---
I'd love to listen to these reports of level 20s unable to advance, if you would direct me to them. Many among us would be happy to help as well. And if you need help, I'd be happy to assist as well.
---
And no, critiquing builds is not stupid or clueless. If you can succeed in a game without working on a build to fit your style, what would the point of the game be? Why keep playing with no progression?
---
I'd like to know what you're really upset about, because there's so much grief here it must be something specific. And I would genuinely like to assist you with whatever it is.
---
Damn invisible blood eagles.
---
It’s true it was supposed to change it with this patch but can’t say it did being I don’t use pistols
---
Nah, ash piles weren't an issue that I recall, I was just happy they fixed them. The issues I'm having don't seem to have any relation to my weapons as I've tried a few.
---
There's a Luck perk, Luck of the Draw I think? It gives a chance every shot for your gun to repair itself
---
For anyone stuck trying to find Levs Hideout key I was able to kill Caleb Fisher through the wall by using vats. Also one of the boarded up windows has a gap in the upper right corner just big enough to shoot through. It took awhile but I was able to kill the raiders in the room this way and then leave and immediately run back into the dungeon so that the bodies respawn which caused the power armored raiser to stick out of the wall just enough for me to loot the key off of his corpse.
---
It’s exciting how it is right now, I legit never know what I’m going to get. I get so much junk when something good rolls around it makes it that much sweeter
---
Don’t have it and it too late now
---
You son of a.... alright, fine.  Technically breathing is an involuntary function.  You can't just not breath, it's not something you can choose not to do.  Even if under water for the maximum amount of time you can hold your breath, you still cannot choose to not breath, your body will breath for you whether you want to or not.
---
My favorite thing is that I don't have to worry about Zorbo constantly snatching at my tail.
---
I would love to see 4 star legendary but they need to increase the daily script limit.
---
I just literally told you the problem many players are facing. Are you dense?
---
I took it before I'd updated my build and regret it. It sounded good but doesn't synergize well with semi-auto sniper rifles, since the whole point is to kill in one shot. It seems to also take a few seconds to take effect which makes it worthless for something like a hardened handmade or fixer (I tried it with a radium rifle and wasn't noticing a damage boost, then saw someone's post that there's a lag.) The only use I have for it now is to try to drop back into stealth during Earl fights every time I reload final word (I'm a stealth rifleman/heavy hybrid.)
---
I run them in a casual team to avoid the stress from everyone who thinks the ops should be run the way \*they\* think is meta, when \*they\* think it's best, using the method \*they\* think should be used.  Those people can go circle jerk together or make someone else's life miserable.
---
you must be new to reddit
---
So then it's out of my decision making capabilities in the first place.
---
It doesn't make the cut as a stand alone game.
---
This engine is holding it (and survival) back from really going places.
---
fixer is the best commando weapon in the game. a F2590 is a nice roll, too.
---
bolt and semi rifles got hit pretty hard by the nerf. may want to consider switching. although the fixer works as a semi, too.
---
I've blown this game off for red dead and cod when this happens 2-3 times in a row
---
Im Xbox, how much are you offering for it?
---
I haven't found a chainsaw since 180 levels ago lol
---
The legendary perks made my characters pretty tanky. Can take both adamantium skeleton and fireproof now with asbestos chest on solar. Rad perk and 5 in adrenaline can do some decent damage. You can still get the 4k xp cap with lunchboxes but it's hard to match unyielding. The great thing about full health is you're not really trying or flopping around, it just works! 
---
My alt is almost there but he hasn't maxed take one for the team. Follow through isn't worth it imo. Stealth works but takes so many cards and the multi's not great as before.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu3vdJB9L7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu3vdJB9L7I)
---
I appreciate this but strongly disagree.
---
I was level 35 or so with my second character when upgrade hit.  I’ve been blitz rushing the main quests trying to level her up for the update.  
---
Completely out of ammo with the paltry decent weapons I had.  0 stimpacks.  0 screws, 0 springs 0 ballistic fiber.  Doing anything other than level 1-6 noob zones with a pipe .38 was virtually impossible, and the former very slow and unrewarding.  
---
Then came the update,  1 daily op completed and I suddenly have ammo for days and a stimpack.  Then the gods dropped a vamp explosive combat shotgun (building a heavy gunner, but got some shout gun perks to make the trip to 40+ easier). I haven’t used many swims since the shotgun.  Using a vanilla Gatling gun.  After a few more daily ops I have 50 Stims, 1000 shells, 3k 5mm.  I hold my own In dailys big time.  
---
If people are struggling post update... they kinda gotta be either pretty bad at the game, or unfamiliar with min/maxing.  I only have a little over 100 total hours between my two characters, but this update has been nothing but great for my solo speed leveling.  I have no problem with ammo, food, stims, dmg... I level way faster not fighting trash level 5 mobs that were previously a waste of ammo.  
---
I really don’t see what the problem is.  Unless they are playing a pistol build, or a bow build or something... but that would have been painful before...
---
They are too lazy to do that. They barely update the damn game mode and even then I barely touch NW at all too, other than to get the xp and atoms and then once I’m finished I dip out of  wave and it was the saddest attempt I’ve ever seen. 
---
Don’t get me wrong I loveeeeeee fo76 and this community!!! 
---
But NW is just sad and it makes me sad. I want to love this game mode and have it give me a nice break to do in between game seshs to break up the mood but it’s just a dumpster fire steeped in fortnites sewage run off.
---
Whatever you want really
---
....I like you.  I mean, I fucking hate you... but I also like you.
---
They’re surprisingly super fun!! Has me hyped to play and I’m loving it so far!
---
I third the motion.
---
Right back at ya. 
---
Solid discussion though. I enjoyed it.
---
500 caps for the outfit and headgear sound good?
---
Good for you then.
---
But again. The only real people to suffer from this nerf are the casual players and especially low level players.
---
As is evident by the posts on this sub.
---
As many said before the nerf. It’s only making METAs the only viable way to play. Which neither what the meta players or the casual players want...
---
Lol, explosive gatling with a bloodied build.
---
Sounds unoptimized....
---
Do other people like office workers and stuff get it off or is it just another day?
---
I’ll do 300 gamer tag is Dylanasaur
---
If they do, i might start using a flamer 😂 no spiders! NOPE
---
Gamertag is Courier07, im at camp
---
If he was it makes sense with the entrance to the burrows near where he was
---
It is a very decent weapon for a Commando build. Furious is pretty good, 25% fire rate is one of the best 2nd stars and reduced weight is solid.  If it doesn't fit your build you should be able to use it to trade for something decent in your class.
---
Radicool + bloodied build helps.
---
Do daily ops.  Get tons of ammo.  Repeat a few times.  After an hour, you should be good for a week.
---
That's almost as as bad when I had my first dragon spawn in Blackreach during the main quest for Skyrim.
---
I never beat fallout 4, I'd just keep restarting with new mods. So you're right in that regard
---
The patch made the game not for you.
---
Wait a month or two for a patch or go meta.
---
The game isn't for casual play anymore
---
Do daily ops for ammo.  It gives an insane amount
---
"Hey, guys instead of fixing an event that people have already played an improving on it we're going to make an entirely new one that could be worse than the last" like Bethesda constantly pulling a head empty, no think....
---
I get distracted because I have been collecting all the alcohol and nuka cola I can find so I can sell it lol, been trying to figure out how to get a nuka cola machine to no avail
---
Don't go semi auto.
---
You chose wrong and should convert to commando
---
Too lazy to make the small part of the game free in order to scrape more money off the same kinds of people who somehow have ranks above 200?
---
I'd have thought laziness is what would made the biggest argument for this
---
Thank you kindly, very much. &lt;3
---
Np
---
He usually hates me too, we’ll see how long it takes me to get the BoS special ops suit/mask now lol
---
At least items don't float anymore. Well there is a very tiny gap but its way better than it was
---
The first time I experienced this, it was at the crater, and one of the raiders killed the radstag when I was trying to follow it.
---
Casual players don't adapt. They leave.
---
Especially with new consoles on the horizon and new games.
---
Not being rude, but the confusion between *compliment* and *complement* really rubs me backwards.
---
Level 137.
---
I don't have a "build". My perks focus on strength, carry capacity, survival and scavenging. (Perks like Strong Back, Batteries included, Mysterious Savior, Quack Surgeon for saving stimpaks, Butcher's Bounty, Green Thumb and Can Do, etc.)
---
I picked up Mater Infiltrator, What Rads, and Ammo Factory for my legendary perks. 
---
I primarily use Resolute Veteran (a ballistic gatling gun), Ultracite and regular Gatling Laser, Plasma Gatling, and a legendary 10mm Pistol for smaller enemies. I've got my Blade of Bastet for melee.
---
With the update I've had an easier time with enemies that used to be more difficult. (Level 60 Ghouls take more damage when I hit them.) Specifically, ner Monongah Mine there's a place where three Super Mutants and one Hound spawn. Pre-patch, I died 5 times when trying to take them out with my ballistic gatling. Today I took them on and never hit half health. Bigger enemies feel easier, but Bloodbugs during the Campfire Tales event absolutely *wrecked* my shit today when they swarmed me. Smaller enemies hit *much* harder.
---
SBQ feels more challenging but also more enjoyable. Earle was an absolute mess today with 3 of us, so I won't be doing that again for a while. 
---
All in all, I like it. But I understand that as someone with a *hefty* scrap pile, I'm at an advantage that most newer players aren't. These changes are difficult on them, and we shouldn't push that aside for fear that Beth will try to improve their lot and accidentally fuck ours. We need to consider all sides. 
---
Also, "builds" aren't everything.
---
Someone stepped in front of my fov once and instead of the beacon starting up it tried to get me to trade with them
---
I like spiders. But what about mutated raccoons that if they melee you steal some of your food or junk n u gotta kill them to get it back!
---
I saw a player near the Overseer’s Camp last night who was very clearly new. I gave him a BUNCH of plans, stimpaks, and 1,000+ 10mm rounds. I have both read and overheard from other players online that this new patch has taken quite the toll on new players, so I felt extremely obligated to help.
---
I hadn’t used my 10mm ammo in so long that I just made the decision to stop being greedy and hand over the ammo to a newer player who could truly use it. 💗
---
You rock! Thank you! I'll hit you up tomorrow, working on an essay tonight. Thanks again!
---
&gt;Too many powerful players would simply kill every mob and boss before anyone could take them. 
---
that's still the case.
---
All good! Good luck on your essay!
---
concentrated fire rank 1 is enough to be able to direct aim for the head. ground pounder is very nice to have here. also, i use gun fu 1 just for the target change, damage comes from tenderizer 3, adrenaline 5 and legendary perk taking one for the team as im always on a team.
---
It’s been this way for almost three months. By this time you should have been used to it.
---
It’s unfortunate that you’re not getting all the free Atoms to which you believe you’re entitled.
---
True, and proximity xp would still be a fix. Even if they only add proximity xp and not proximity item drops I think most would be very happy.
---
Post patch can this weapon still hang? I’m level 280 so I’m into all the rough parts of the map and grinding daily ops, I don’t want to switch if I’m going to really feel a damage reduction
---
I'm hearing the glaive plan cannot be traded ? (🤷‍♂️) If you're still interested (or anyone) I'm looking for the solar panels plan 🙃
---
I'm just glad I didn't upgrade it.
---
1 coin isn't end of the world but considering I burned through most of my 250 stored card picks it still burns
---
Not even legendary effects are available for it??? What the hell I'm so letdown now
---
lol you said it yourself, it just takes more ammo to kill something. still no strategy to builds or weapon choices or boss battles it just takes twice as many bullets to do anything, so whats good about that?
---
True but at the same time I think zenimax is banking on milking the whales. To get the casuals they would need to make the cosmetics killer and I doubt they wanna do that and or care to. But I get where your coming from. Who knows what’ll happen, I’m guessing if they ever made NW a stand-alone it’ll be in a few years after an overhaul patch like wastelanders, but at that point in time I think Battleroyal will be dying off just like sooo survival games died after a couple years of being huge. It’s a fad game mode. They should’ve done a  PvPvE game mode instead and put their own spin on it.
---
Sounds like more people afk at events.
---
I think OP means “Plasma” gatling
---
bye
---
I'm high health at 350 weight, with about 175 freed up for collecting shit.  High strength, best backpack, a couple perks to increase carry weight (in strength category) and perks to reduce food and stim weights - typically try to only carry weapons I really use a lot, and try to have those legendaries with reduced weight.
---
I'd rather have afk people at events than get little to no xp if the wrong person is there.
---
The same thing happened to me! But since I can't drop or trade them, what's the point?
---
its a typical "run for the new stuff" story. everyone want to try whats new while some have problem to down anything at all. it will regulate by time. just think of release of ACP: i didnt saw any nuke on fissure prime for about a week. now they are coming back and, what i see, the nukes are about 60% monogah and 40% fissure prime.
---
you mean as a semi? because I wouldn't know how it compares to the gauss. higher dps that's for sure, but I suppose you're already used to you build.
---
as a commando though, a lot better. just mod it (fixer uses combat rifle mods) and take it out for a spin, no need to invest in commando. it's a tad weaker now but it's still the best rifle out there, so.
---
are you sneaking? if not, railway and the 10mm smg are probably the highest dps rifles for you. fixer is still pretty good, but shines as a stealth weapon.
---
I'm sad now
---
I just figured it would be cool if we had some sort of way to rev up heavy weapons in game similar to how you mention you can rev them in real life! Thanks for the cool info about how it works irl tho :D
---
Are perk coins global through the account or character bound?
---
Guess I can put my Bloodied SS Combat knife (Stabbington) away for a bit 😝
---
Can you please add Ultra-Light Limb mod for Secret Service armor?
---
Probably joining a team that has already completed the Ops and just forgot to switch their team to something else. Make your own team that'll guarantee the people joining them want to run it. 
---
I guarantee this wouldn't be a problem if private teams got bonuses too. I play with 2 other people, sometimes more, and after our first run on Elder we just try to meme the thing as much as possible. We all got chainsaws with the fire mod on them and ran it, but there was some down time between our runs. We ran today's op at least 30 times and a lot of the runs were carrying lowbies and randos. You're never guaranteed anything when playing with randoms. You could get a team that literally doesn't do the obj and just farms enemies for xp and ammo. You gotta go into the mindset with this in mind.
---
It did all that 😃
---
Unrelated. Please teach me everything you know. I’m on my first play through lvl 78 and struggling!
---
Perk coins are unique per character; not account global.
---
#***NOOOOOOOOOOO***
---
WHYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
It was such a fun event
---
&gt;consider the perspectives of others before you start being so dismissive
---
This does literally nothing to change the fact that before the update, more than half of the zones/events in the game had low level enemies that bored me out of my mind because i could just walk through them all and never worry about survival/dying, but now it's all relevant to me.
---
People you know are having a tough time? Help them figure out the game then instead of making some argument that would suggest the narrative that what we had before was somehow better where all high lvl players were bored to death because of irrelevant low level trash mobs that gave almost no xp/etc and you could walk around just 1 hitting everything until sick of it.
---
I literally/honestly love the fact that i can't walk through the majority of the game just blowing away low level trash mobs that are just worthless annoyance instead of threats.
---
Hit us up when you start. Some of us can suit you up with some starter gear/supplies, and I for one would be happy to offer a welcome package.
---
Okay yeah just check, i misread something so few days ago😅😅
---
Please read. At least till second sentence
---
If you guys would do that i would be super pleased!! 😁
---
I don’t know why we wouldn’t have an option to start the barrel cycle since most games give you the option when aiming. I worked on one a little while back and it was really cool this is the only reason why I know this and you’re welcome I always like sharing information if I can.
---
No it doesn't. Only SS requires grinding. The rest can just be bought. You have a full set of unyielding in minutes.
---
I actually have that same issue I’ve done like 400 rad rumbles for no barrel plan but I’ve had like 10 hazmats
---
*No more slogan!*
---
*No more excuses!*
---
*No more blinding our eyes and baring our asses to the world!*
---
*We have the power!*
---
*We have the resources!*
---
*We have the energy!*
---
***Let's get together and wreck shit!***
---
Works great with my instigating shotguns and AA fixer.
---
If you’re the leader, just swap the goal after a run to Casual. You can always swap back to Ops the next time you want to run one.
---
But you only get the double xp for *completing* the op, and you’re probably going to take more than 5 min to complete it — so why not just hope right in? :)
---
I fucking hope not, after spending close to 100 legendary modules to get a 3 star vanguards SS chest I'd just want to die more, and all those weapons, I dread to think how long that would take
---
That's cool.  I don't remember it, but I'm not disputing it either.  After a few years, it's easy to forget something like that.
---
Imagine using Televisions as a source of news in the wasteland. Everytime a new update arrives, the next time you turn on a TV it will play a trailer to tell you the news about the patch. 
---
Ugh we can dream
---
Fun but troublesome to find teams
---
At the first attempt, you get spawned at the location of your camp. If someone else's camp is already in your build area, then your location resets and the second (and third, fourth, fifth,..) spawns are at the nearest FT point.
---
Fantastic idea
---
Im pretty much doing the same thing I was last season. Get on do all the dailes and challenges in under an hour then I run 3 quick elders....then I stare blankly into the primordial void and wonder if this is all life is meant to be....followed by going to Mama Mole Miner to be more disappointed than my first 4 sexual partners. At most they've squeezed 20 extra minutes out of me.
---
Let me just say for the record: stabbington is an epic name for a knife.
---
Yeah I remember the heavy class from TF2 can rev up his minigun, hope it’s implemented into Fo76 someday!
---
Lmao, cute, another hilarious shilling post.  If bethesda is going to develop a shitty product and fail at every turn with this game, maybe they should find a different occupation/industry.
---
(´ー`)y-~~
---
&gt;bethesda is a business, they need to make money
---
Funny, more desperate shilling, there's no excuse for microtransactions/season passes/all this other trash in paid games, it's not even free to play.
---
If your business makes a trash product full of hilariously pathetic bugs then it's not going to be exempt from criticism.
---
Nice try.
---
I think this every time I try to get in a lobby.
---
Yeah, it's heal 1 health per second for a few seconds, and recover 1 AP per second for a few seconds, with just 1 star in it.
---
Why carry stims if you use Vamp weapons?
---
I don’t use Vamp and rarely have more than 10 stimpacks or 5 radaways on any character.. bloody or full health.
---
On my heavy PA full health I’ve stopped carrying any radaways since I got what rads
---
Oh nice I'll have to check that out
---
Oh word ty
---
I think it's kinda fun. I can smash, smash, smash, block, heal a little bit, get some action points back, and go back to smashing!
---
Appreciate it 🤙🏼
---
Yeah it was weird, happened to me, crafted 2, used one and then it said both were gone
---
I got the bomber jacket, thought everyone got the same rewards
---
I didn’t invest in it. Got luck legendary instead and invested in crit savvy and better criticals. Now ever second hit is a crit and I feel does better damage without any lag.
---
Did you ever go to the right side of the map before hitting level 40 any time before one wasteland. Because that was not a beginner area, super mutant overlords and explosive auto turrets are no joke
---
I tried it on rank 3 using my hunting rifle against some level 100 cave crickets and the damage boost is quite useful. I'm certainly keeping it and ranking it up when I have the chance. From what I've seen it should come in very handy for repeaters as well as semi-auto and full auto rifles, perhaps even pistols.
---
Well I'll hop on YouTube a get some tips and tricks real quick.
---
No, it only happened to me once, but with many thousands of people playing at a given time over the years I did know people that it happened to so there is that.  OK I confess I did play Farmville for a couple of weeks on Facebook but I wasn't counting that one.  Doubt or not, its nothing to me and does not change my experience.
---

---
Switch to prime my guy. You will want not for .50 ever again. With Max Ammo Factory and Ammosmith  you would make 450 .50 with Ultracite you make 900 .50.....its worth it.
---
&gt; The game isn't for casual play anymore
---
Funny, but no less true.
---
I would imagine casuals make up the bulk of the playerbase, and they've all just been alienated with this patch.  
---
That's a really big yikes on Bethesda's part.
---
I don’t I do challenges do my daily ops if I get something cool I stay playing for a bit longer then I go play a different game
---
You mean like a tape player or something or like bgm?
---
Score Lvl 37/100 for now, advice : grind xp for legendary perks with gear with +1 int, night person perk, cranberry relish with herbivore mutation, red mentats or daddy-o with chem fiend perk, brain bombs or other that give you intelligence. You will see how the grind is quick... And lunchboxes of course.
---
How do you actually play melee constantly with the hit registration, it pissed me off enough with shotguns and flamers
---
I got married and had a child while I waited
---
Wrong sub
---
Well the 7 levels was over 2 or 3 hours. I am leveling up a few times an hour though. Currently at 401 after last night's session.
---
I'm just very efficient at killing. I take down groups if high level enemy's extremely quickly haha
---
Atm I have about 95k 45 and 10mm if I don't use bandoleer perk I weigh about oh 30k I think
---
inb4 they break the stealth mechanics
---
Ok, srry. Posted in market aswell, but no comments...
---
I'll pass then, I started the quest and found no interest in it, and this would be the only thing I would occasionally brew from it since I don't need to be immune to earls screech attack. I'm not melee so I always keep my distance from him as it is. But thanks for letting me know.
---
I see it from both sides.  I understand the criticisms and people being upset with changes.  I've played online multiplayer long enough to know that there are always going to be changes.  And some changes are not going to be for your benefit.  It sucks.  But the best thing to do is adapt and overcome.  And sure, make your criticisms known.  They won't know what to tweak without feedback.
---
The thing is PA is already strong, since people keep forgetting the innate damage reduction. No legendary armor can give that much resistance unless you factor in sentinel. PA should have to effect's similar to strangler heart, maybe Tesla armor that boost energy damage etc.
---
What level of FT do you have? I don't have the perk coins to upgrade it from level 1, and I don't have the charisma to run suppressor/tenderizer (so no worries there with this possible bug), but I honestly can't tell the difference between having FT and not having it.
---
Nah. The gear i spent months trying to get now sucks. My melee gear is literally useless.
---
Now that we are with contemporary, can we have a wall in triangle shape for the top of the house? Like, you have that shape there because is 2 piece fundation/wall, but if you make a house with 3, you can't give it that shape in the top (i don't know how to write it correctly, if someone understood, please use better words for me!)
---
I have the perk at max level (40%)
---
I'm all for listening to criticism, and I've seen some legitimate criticism too.
---
However, I've also seen people whining about how their copy and paste bloodied netbuild can't hack it anymore and rather than adapt, they just cry wanting the game to change to suit them rather than trying to change to meet the new gaming environment.
---
These two things should not be looked upon equally as if both have equal merit.
---
A person who has tried and cannot manage for whatever reason, they should be heard and Bethesda should address those issues, and I feel that these issues should be addressed.
---
For those that refuse to even try should have their "criticisms" dismissed wholesale.
---
Its not just the lack of space. It just plain looks bad inside. I much preferred the way it was, it was much more in keeping with the actual structure itself.
---
Are you on pc? Ill buy one off you!
---
OP’s point is that Daily Ops teams are for Daily Ops... if you’re unable to join the Op then you choosing another team type is likely a better move for all involved:
---
- you actually benefit since Daily Op teams only benefit from Daily Ops, and
---
- others on the Daily Ops team benefit in that they can more accurately plan who will actually join the Op
---
I think so, but I’m not a melee so I don’t know for sure.
---
Have my free reward. Ty!
---
Also sucks for wastelanders people who never experienced it the first and only time.
---
Toxic valley could be a giant radscorpion or sumn
---
And you think you will get one here?
---
I agree so much with this. People whining that everything is broken it’s not for the most part. The only real thing I’ve seen broken is the health curve graph that determines the health of enemies at different levels where the health triples a low level enemy (at around level 14-16 I think) causing the low level players to struggle trying to defeat a single enemy. 
---
With the legendary effects on weapons they should  of been boosted a bit to be on par with the top 4 choices, even though yes the top 4 have been brought down a bit they still are a way better choice than the rest of the effects.
---
I have to agree BR games seem to milk money
---
A face off against the purveyor. She gets to use her OP gear to try to kill us
---
&gt; I have no idea why my anti armor weapons are almost equally as efficient when I’m near death.
---
That's because AA is still multiplicative as it's a debuff on the enemy, whilst bloodied is additive and therefore mostly useless as it only adds a relatively small amount of extra damage for being at low health.
---
AA weapons are the new 'god roll'. Stock your vendor with them, they'll sell like hotcakes.
---
Go to the map and click on social, then go to the tabs for public teams. There should be one to two daily ops teams on your server. When you are in a team (any team actually, just that the daily ops teams reward more xp) and activate the mission, the game will prompt your team to join the op.
---
On you map screen (ps4) hit R1 to see teams &amp; use r1 to browse to public teams - this has a list of teams, casual, events, builders, daily op etc.
---
Select a daily op that isn't full. On the main hud back in the world it shows if other team members are doing the daily ops, or a popup will tell you when a member has started the daily op.
---
Was going to name it Lord Stabbington, but that sounded too posh lol
---
That what i thought
---
Thx, will try to do something with this ~~shit~~...
---
NUKE MIRVS, I came to you))).
---
Or you use something else to kill enemies behind the door? No weapon / body parts sticking from the wall for me.(((
---
What's the trick. I only seem to see them after they 've been up for a few minutes. I hop in, see the Join button, and then join.  
---
Trying to solo a bunch of Super Mutants in a mall post patch (and at level 121) is not really doable for me.
---
I yeah, I don't know what's normal but I got 4,000 xp tonight for completing ACP plus I finally got the mask after close to 30 runs.
---
You're right about Survival mode being removed, that's my bad. Wasn't thinking clearly but am glad you understand my suggestion.
---
Bethesda either lacks the competence or just doesn't care to look into doing what to most people is pretty intuitive.
---
Remember, the current camp placement system we have is the third version of it - vanilla was just pack up your camp, 1st iteration was just a dialog box but otherwise same as vanilla and our current iteration we get to reroll but only after we're loaded into the world.
---
It was pretty obvious and even suggested when the issue first came up just to keep trying until you could find a world where you can place your camp.
---
Sadly what we have now is the best that Bethesda is capable of doing.
---
I also run a stealth sniper and have both of your guns. I upgraded it to level 3 for 30% damage. It works really well if you can stay in stealth. No regrets at all
---
Shit really was insane. It was pretty awesome going from level 28 to level 70-something during the triple XP event. I went from struggling to fight enemies and avoiding the hard ones to having my full junkie's heavy gunner build and killing everything in sight in the span of a few days.
---
Also, don't start a casual team then switch it to daily op and start berating your team members because they aren't doing daily ops with you.  Had that happened the other night.
---
You caved. I'm just taking it as it comes. I stopped caring mid last season. That feeling has carried on to this day.
---
If it happens, it happens, if I doesn't, it doesn't. I haven't even done a daily op yet and I really don't care that I may miss out on the weekly score for it.
---
Yeah. You don't want your knife sounding like a prissy shiv.
---
THIS! It feels like work, and I play for fun!
---
I share 2\* Bandolier.  I figure everyone can benefit from reduced ammo weight.  Half the players I see in public teams don't share at all, so I'm usually not picky about what others share.
---
That sucks bro. If it was xbox I'd help you out, but I hope you're able to work that stuff back!
---
Yeah, real great when you're using a hunters explosive gat and mowing shit down like a tank.
---
Doesn't work the same way when you're trying to play stealth though and want to drop enemies before they know you're there.... Because you're stealth build is just that.... STEALTH. Which usually means you put all your skills into sneak bonuses and damage and little in armour for maximum offense and Min defense.
---
You need actual tactics when approaching multiple enemies on your own and need to choose your targets in a wise order and timing so as to not alert others.... Not blowing crap up all over the place to the point people in the next State can hear you. 
---
But seeing as how while in stealth now, high level super mutants need 3-4 hits to the brain before they drop, and the enemies seem to have better perception, caution turns into danger real fast.
---
There are many other examples and classes and builds that have issues. But I guess because you tried one heavy weapons, straight offensive class and it worked out fine for you, I guess everything else is fine for everybody else's class/builds.
---
Guess what everybody?
---
I can piss in a toilet while standing up perfectly fine.... I guess that means all women and people in wheelchairs should be able to piss standing up too.... Those who complain they don't use the same genitals or can't use their legs just have to shut up and git gud.
---
And here I was thinking having 300 stims on me was overkill...
---
You're probably selling to a duper that doesn't care because they can make more of both whenever they want. They just want their hands on the outfit while it's rare so they can capitalise on making a cap/trade/cash profit off it. 
---
Same with any early rare thing. Happened with Fasnacht masks. Happened with Treasure outfits. It happened with plasma grenade plans. It's no different here.
---
Fireproof is your friend
---
I maxed ammo factory and master infiltrator. The others are just fun things that I may replace with the SPECIAL bister cards.
---
The Assaultron with the say-what-now?
---
Took a while, but I managed to [find an old screen of it](https://imgur.com/AdFkD5X). It was constantly flying through the wall and down through the ground
---
Laughs in combat shotgun
---
If you’re on Xbox I’m interested in being that one dude who is merely helpful for killing and sitting in an area but not much else. These op areas are too much like a maze, so I have no idea how to get to anywhere.
---
Yeah also, they could help their team a lot more by actually having good perk cards that help them kill more enemies and stay alive longer. They are essentially dead weight rn, if another player wanted Adrenaline 5 they would have it.
---
Games are allowed to share mechanics you know.
---
You might have an armor piece with the effect “reduce damage while blocking” 
---
That makes shotguns OP when using vats.
---
Well, you did technically get a comment, so you were correct. 
---
There are at least four bartering subs that I know of. Try those and I hope you have better luck.
---
What the hell *was* that Mutant using anyway? I know the Blood Eagle leader uses a auto-grenade launcher, but all I saw from the Mutant Firestarter was the fireballs coming at us and that's is. Never got a good look at what gun they were using.
---
Because of all the hackers. I was killed yesterday by someone half way across the map. There was no way they could have one shot me from a different building at that distance without a magic bullet that went through at least four walls.
---
If you're still on could I also give you some caps to place it in my camp? Or I could place some rad barrels in your camp?
---
1,000 caps
---
It's the final boss in daily ops for robots. Assualtron with heavy armor and 2 50 cal mini gun arms.
---
&gt; I think people are wwwaaayyyyyy too used to one or two shotting everything that they cannot accept the fact some non-boss npcs can take more than 5 bullets.  
---
This is part of the story. The other part is that some people legitimately aren't that good at gaming and maybe even just thinking. 
---
Like the most basic shit like not running into the middle of fighting 8 enemies at once, rather than picking them off a couple at a time or for bloodied builds just to raise their health a tad so they're not riding it so close to the line and STILL dominate.
---
Having said that, there are also some legit concerns. It's inevitable that Bethesda is going to need to do some tweaking. The game can't remain as is. Bethesda will lose too many customers.
---
All aboard the Nope Train to Fuck-That-ville
---
No sir, even got the radstag knife skin on it so it’s big and beefy
---
No caps pls, and if i would consider it would be more that 1k
---
If you’re able to kick people then you’re not doing your job.
---
Last time it happened the team leader wasn't even in the op
---
go do colossal menace, always heaps of people begging for resses there
---
or do Cryptid event
---
I have loaded in to my camp being torn up by mutants.
---
I logged out with it at full status.
---
The game loads your camp well before your characters feet hit the ground.
---
Exactly. He’s not doing his job.
---
I can help you out if you are on xbox but it should be something fairly easy to come across if you are doing events.
---
?
---
How is a PSA regarding daily ops for low level players. It says it's recommended for level 50+...
---
Also, some high level players do mind. If you're not helping towards completing the objective you're just dead weight and a moocher.
---
I have the grocer backpack for the water and food, the pharmacy perk at max for chems, the carry weight perk, the one to make the PA lighter too, i deep pocket all my armor and some has to reduce the weight or guns too, i have a capacity of around 400 and i use 300 normally, i only get overweight in the PA (if i have all my fav guns on me, if i left some in the stash then is fine) or when i farm a lot like in the glitched line in the sand
---
True, but is ‘helping out’ really comparable with ‘putting yourself in their place’? I don’t think so.
---
Nice! But yeah man, if you're ever short on ammongive it a try. Maybe I just got lucky.
---
You think way too much. Sneak is one of the most brain dead build. Literally you said 3-4 shots to kill. Why you need tactics when you can mow down 3 supermutants in like 5 seconds
---
Damn dude you stole my luck the past 3 times I've done colossal problem I haven't gotten any of the new shit
---
Was just joking to lighten the mood a bit lol but cool
---
Nice solo'ing, still don't see the point in a .50 cal hunting rifle compared to other mods but I'll give it another looksee whenever I dust off my rifleman character 
---
I just usually prefer strength builds in games, so I'm comfy with heavies and melee atm
---
It does not help with the damage from you legacys. Fire proof and dense won't help either. You just need to learn to jump and shoot so you don't blow yourself up
---
Gta has the same feature
---
Yes, perfect Ultracite ammo farming event.
---
Already have it and Emergency Protocols mod but still get down in less than 1 second.......
---
This is what the game is supposed to be like / its almost like survival Mode in previous fallouts / and its not the end of the tweaking , it will
---
Continue to be adjusted til the balance is right ,
---
 Quit whinging and kill mole rats and scorched til u level up then u have earnt the right to speak
---
I think that most Fallout players are role playing on some level. It can be subtle, but it seems to me that there's always an element of roleplay in this game in particular.
---
I'm sure they removed debuffs from the game with this patch
---
It's big of you to admit that you were wrong about this. I still see so many bloodied players crying endlessly about how their build has been so nerfed out of the meta that they're looking for the new top meta build or how it's ruined the game for them but they're still the ones doing the most damage compared to most other builds.
---
Hopefully it's just growing pains and shit calms down over the next week.
---
Thank you. I'd save my slot for other perk then.
---
Why can't they just put it in the hands of modders or something. I'm sure people would develop it for free.
---
Honestly love everything about it. Just looking forward to more content being added. I get that everything is difficult to do in these times, so I’m thrilled with what we do have.
---
You're build ended up with a couple extra points of damage my build lost a thousand points of damage and needs a complete rework because I can't kill things before they one hit me
---
It's pretty weird. I'm happy to buy it, but it seems impossible to find in vendors, for some reason.
---
By comparison, the Fixer plan was a cakewalk to get.
---
From what I’ve seen, it’s apparently an assault rifle firing fireballs. Why they didn’t just add a new weapon to do that for us to obtain, I don’t know.
---
Except for people that still dont realise you need to stand near the uplink to make it go faster
---
I’m hoping they expand on wastelanders and have a big quest line with the brotherhood of steel
---
I know this is in reference to adventure, but I honest want it for nuclear winter. It’s the only way to make leveling in that mode tolerable.
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
I'm in a similar boat. not having problems killing things, but am wasting more ammo...not a fan of that...who the hell ever asked for that?
---
It's a bench which holds no significant value. Like a couch. The ones you find in Watoga train station are an example
---
If you are running normal explosive weapons they are great. But legacys they don't touch. I'd still recommend running 1 of them for all the other explosions in the wasteland
---
My 3 charisma wants a word
---
Playing the game.
---
Often killing enemies or doing dailies and challenges. Regularly getting interrupted by events. Sometimes Crafting Chems and gathering resources, occasionally dropping a nuke. But most importantly inventory management.
---
What do you mean “now”? It hasn’t changed at all since the update other than higher level mole miners, which don’t effect the amount of lead and other stuff you get. It was always a good event to do if you wanted some quick resources
---
Thank you for that back handed complement. /s
---
Lol I always get stimpacks from ops. And I'll buy like 200 from you for 20 caps each
---
Same here.  Been farting around with Tesla's and trying to find a good plasma gun, as the shitty one I have actually has ok damage, and with the ammo perk it's actually potentially usable now.
---
Only if I can step on them or have them as a pet
---
I mean with Ammo Factory you can easily make much more ammo than you'd otherwise be able to.
---
It's probably either magic or you have a peice of armour with 15% less damage while blocking. 
---
Here's a video that explains it. 
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
This is how it works.
---
Why buy a game full price? It will be on sale cheaper soon!
---
You buy it because you want it immediately...
---
Not worth the effort for the 40 rounds it’ll drop
---
Eh, burned out actually, haven’t logged in this season at all. :/ Was thinking I’d just have a break and come back for Halloween, but seems like that’s not happening? :(
---
no.
---
The foosball table is by far my favorite. The animations are on point, however there is a sound glitch and if you play it too long and stop the foosball sounds follow you no matter where you go.
---
No. Both are prefixes.
---
Ty 👍🏼 really interested to see the safari gorilla backpack..
---
I got it!
---
The heavy gunner perks work with every heavy weapon that doesn't have a explosive effect without being legendary. So the minigun, gatling gun, 50cal, gatling laser/plasma, LMG, Gauss minigun, plasma caster. You get the general idea, however weapons like the grenade launchers, missile launchers and fat man's won't get a buff to their damage output because they already deal explosive damage.
---
If any other heavy weapon is legendary, the minigun for example and one of it's perks is explosive then your heavy gunner perks will still work because the perk looks at the base game weapon and not the legendary effects.
---
If you are to use Demolition expert on top of this, your legendary "explosive" weapons will also gain a boost. But this perk card also works with the launchers. Which is the only perk to increase damage on already explosive weapons without the legendary effect.
---
Thanks
---
You should have taken the food/water chem one instead. It's QoL.
---
Oh god, telsa? I'm so glad this combo doesn't exist for that weapon. It'd be the worst. Only thing worse would be the addition of an explosive effect too.
---
Exactly.
---
Just like a radio or something that lets us choose a song to have playing in our camp.
---
Sorry, I should have typed legendary slot.  Fireproof is wonderful, espcially for some tough attacks from Dops bosses.
---
Yeah I am having fun breaking locks off people’s doors and water generators.
---
I'm wearing Chinese stealth armor and Polly's old head.  I think I'm level 108 and have stealth all the way up.
---
Ah damn, cause I wanted a quad faster reload Tesla, but so far no one has a 2 star version, and people wont sellmea3 star variant either. Like now I have a two shot fr Tesla and a scorched killing, ffr. But I just want quad and fr, cause I feel like the amount of times I reload in battle sucks, and it takes forever even with speed demon
---
This IS the fix. There were some really broken guns/builds. Bethesda is rebalancing weapons and enemy levels to make weapon damage easier to adjust. Its a living game, like fortnight. It will continue to evolve based on feedback.
---
There is a lot to enjoy, especially if you are a fan of the Fallout universe. The community is generally super awesome, as you can see above. Take your time with the story, find a camera and take pictures of your favorite moments, and other people's bases.
---
I've seen a lot of similar posts in this sub full of good tips, so I'd recommend searching here for "beginner advice".
---
Oh I am. Daily ops even. I think on ps4 people just spam the Rez button
---
I got what i hoped for and enjoy how the games growing / i am a older fan of fallout - played them all , i can almost guarantee that the bitching and moaning is from peeps under 30 ish  and the slander from under 20's , / when they took away survival  i wasnt happy
---
But got over it - hope something like it comes back or a better pvp  mechanic for adv mode , go Clean your rooms
---
Unless they go the route destiny 2 did with upgrade modules when they increased the light level caps. But this is Bethesda so it likely won’t happen that way unless upgrade modules are added to the atom shop.
---
Yes .
---
explosive teslas are terrible.
---
That's a thing i never knew of, cool
---
I've seen a quad explosive on someone with a crap ton of bloodied. Was gonna ask to buy it but he left the trade cause I "didnt have anything he wanted"
---
I'm only a tank in PA. I think my legendary perks are part of that. I added 13 perk points worth and doubled my pitifully low endurance. I used my points in a lot of defense - I have took max body guards and reflector, plus a level flame and 3 levels and radiation protection perks. I make sure I'm on a full team running ops and earle so all stacked together with X01 PA means today's op with the stealth blood eagles was sort of a breeze. They were like 3-4 shots, though I shot way more than that due to missing a ton while they were stealth. But then I ran around and picked up hundreds of rds of 5mm off the bodies after the boss dropped.
---
I play with the music off and recommend everyone else that's played for more than 10 minutes to do the same. The ambient sounds are great. I get tired of listening to the same music VERY quickly.
---
I’d be ok with this but what I would really love is a holotape player entertainment center, and they could add video holotapes like with the fallout 4 mod. We could have little corny videos to play or music or play your games on it and it shows to the visitors of your camp! It would be great!
---
I saw a fucking mole rat in the point my camp is usually kept. That stopped my camp loading in.
---
That's hard. will sound a little weird but  It's kind of  an abusive relationship. And I keep coming back
---
I would recommend running absorption as well since it heals you as well as charging your cores
---
I need to do this same quest! PSN: Avalynch
---
To be fair it often is toxic.
---
Yeah that would be really cool actually.
---
I leveled as rifleman starting at beta. It’s definitely more challenging than many other builds.  I frequently got non rifle guns that did more damage without spec into that type of weapon.
---
That would be a good idea for it. They could even just add a new purpose to legendary modules so its stuff people already know how to get
---
faster reload is a 3\* effect.
---
I have the chemist backpack so dont need traveling pharmacy unless I use PA. But yes definately needed the weight reduction either way and to me better to carry than stash since the perks dont affect the stash weight. 
---
Never thought about vampires during a bloodied build, neglecting the perk bonus for nerd rage and adrenal reaction on non bloodied weapons. Might have to play around with that and maybe make a low health non bloodied (greater than 20%) attempt to see how that rolls
---
&gt; But the more I played, the more I noticed the problem wasn't the system, but my playstyle 
---
It's very much this and player knowledge of the game, items and builds.
---
However, while it's good for those that wanted a challenge from what was otherwise a game that was way too easy, there are some valid points from people who don't want to go full throttle every moment they're playing.
---
For me, I like the idea of having a lower level area so if you want to chill, maybe farm for junk or levels to prep yourself for harder areas. Rather than have the forest at 50 max, maybe have the max closer to like 20 or 30. Still a challenge when you're starting out but when you get close to or over 50, pretty chill that you don't have to worry too much about being destroyed.
---
In some ways it did, in others it did the opposite.
---
Awesome. Sending a msg now
---
Hate those things. Will be easier next time tho.
---
" makes me nigh unlikable"
---
I know what you meant, but reading that made me laugh.
---
I expected that sooner, tbh.  I figured it would be a move to push duped legendaries into obscurity.
---
1.3k hours in and still loving it
---
Ooooooooh
---
Didnt even known that. I'm still somewhat new to the game, so idk what prefixes or suffixes or stuff like that hehehe. But why whenever I look at the effects, faster reload is second?
---
Wow that really blows.  Halloween content is what I most look forward to.
---
Take it while you got it
---
I did probably level 75-200 melee. 2h instigating power attack used to crush 98% of enemies fast.
---
It's not on the roof of the garage.  It appears to be on the roof of the building connected by a walkway to the garage.
---
Go down to 20% for nerd rage as well.  At 20% health you still get 70% more damage from nerd rage and adrenal reaction, but you're super hard to kill because of vampire's.  You also benefit from emergency protocols if in power armor
---
Faster reload is 3rs.faster fire rate is second
---
I never managed to solo a nuke till around lvl 200 so you'll get there eventually, it is so much easier in a group but don't stop trying
---
My argument is why should I min max? If I want a generalist character who can do a bit of everything and explore at my own pace why shouldn’t I? This update has effectively made it unplayable for me because I didn’t specialise in a specific weapon type, don’t have bloodied weapons etc.. this game was perfectly playable as a non min max character before and now what should be a safe area (forest) is full of enemies taking a ton to kill. IMHO this game has been tuned to support those who want to go down a specific route or are already high level, I can on,y play for an hour a day at most due to work and other commitments, I don’t have friends who play this so I’m always solo and I was having fun even though I haven’t even made it to Harper’s ferry yet just taking my time and exploring but now everything takes so much effort to kill it’s just not worth the effort.
---
Well, i grind out the score dailies and weeklies. Then i gather steel ores and lead ores, if i'm out of acid i capture the workshop in the toxic valley next to the water park. While i do that i also capture a workshop to produce fusion cores.
---
Once that's done i usually go to the cranberry bog to fight some scorchbeasts or nuke WS to gather materials to craft flux. If i got the mats i look which flux i got the least and nuke an area to get that type and craft some. All in the while i'm grinding resources and maybe sometimes fending off griefers.
---
When i'm not doing any of the above i'm simply scrolling through LFG to see if anyone needs help with anything or wants to buy something i've got and i offer it. If that also isn't the case then i'm playing several rounds of NW till i get bored and log off.
---
Im looking for the plans. How much are you charging.
---
No you did not.
---
The odds of that are just not there.  Unless they changed drop rates dramatically, and it seems like that would have been reported elsewhere
---
I will tell you, that yes, they do get easier, granted I say that as I have launched many nukes, but none since patch 22 so I could be in for a rude awakening the next time I try.
---
But I'll leave you with my rant for my 1st attempt at level 61, and God was I miserable. My first attempts server crashed, then I got screwed by a late guest to the party. Lost all hope but kept at it and once I leveled up and played with my build I could fly through them!
---

---
it's just a mishap. the order in which the effects are listed isn't necessarily representative of their actual tier.
---
two shot and quad are prefixes, faster fire rate and explosive are 2\* and faster reload is 3\*. you can only have one of each.
---
I’m new. What is “bloodied”?
---
Ah ok cause on my 2 shot I see fires an additional shot, +15% faster reload, vats fills meter +15% faster
---
More health seems to do the trick
---
I'm upset that the boss Super Mutant wasn't a ultra-powerful Behemoth. It seems so obvious.
---
If you consider that only lvl1000's can respond to this post then not many people will reply
---
It drops like 200+
---
Oh sweet, well thanks, now I know I'm getting myself into 3*s  I really appreciate it. I'd trade my 2 teslas and some bunk junk for a quad fr Tesla. With charging barrel and the reflex sight
---
&gt;I don’t like having to shoot a mole rat in the head 3 times to kill it.
---
Omg this is the biggest thing for me, all the easy little bs enemies that I used to one shot like mole rats and bloatflies are now these tanky little bastards. Two .50 shots to the head is a bit much for anything let a lone radroach.
---
Oh that sounds fun, especially with those tesla builds in crowded areas
---
Real life Halloween is cancelled so Bethesda cancelled Fallout Halloween to reflect with the corona times and they’ll enforce a CAMP only lockdown for the period of the event.
---
Blocker and serendipity. The latter is essential as a bloody, and blocker very valuable to any build.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
u/Valseek
---
that's life as a bloodied build. you need to be sneaking or wearing PA to face tank enemies.
---
stacking dr and er ain't gonna help, and even all the damage mitigation perks aren't gonna keep you alive against a horde of mobs. you can try class freak + lifegiver, but it's not gonna change much.
---
there are ways around it but most are esoteric builds. like spamming sausages, or vampire shotguns.
---
Late to the party here, but I run carnivore, and use smoked mirelurk fillets. No unyielding armor, chem backpack. Thru hiker. Bear arms. Good with salt, which is switched out for bloody mess for bosses. Carry weight is normally around 430+ after other food buffs. 
---
Food is where it's at. 
---
I carry 4 weapons at all times, PA at all times. And no problem with weight unless I'm on an extended junk run.
---
Edit: no deep pocketed armor either. 14 base STR, but after buffs, normally sitting at 28-30 STR plus the mirelurk fillets adding 60 carry weight.
---
I think you and I are playing two different games because I am right... you are ABYSMALLY wrong. I have video evidence of this and it's been archived repetitively on reddit for over the past two years, so downvote whatever you like. To write that much and be completely wrong... meet me in the game right now and I will prove you wrong 1000x over. Please dont come on here and mislead people.
---
My friends and I get murdered by other players regularly when we have pacifist on. If I'm using an explosive weapon, NO I am not doing damage to other players, but the explosion triggers the option for PvP for THEM and I am in a position where I cannot defend myself.
---
Sometime it's very frustrating when your just trying to enjoy the game with your friends... then some guy will be incessantly stabbing or shooting you to initiate combat... and if you shoot back while in pacifist, you die. Makes no sense lol!
---
The exception WOULD be if it was a workshop, but test what I'm saying. Happens to me EVERY SINGLE time I play. I was hoping to get feedback, not misleading garbage. Test what I'm saying, because if it doesn't apply to you, then my friends and I need to contact Bethesda about this Pacifist glitch BS. It's been happening to me for years!
---
Wow that would be pretty stupid if that's all it took!
---
My camp also spawns me out of the map boundaries every other time I fast travel to it 😂, there's a lot of quality of life that could be done with camps
---
Yeah that’s it, the shotguns that do an unexpected amount of damage have those perks. Even my guass. Kinda annoying that they’re piss poor weapons without being glitched. They actually work how a shotgun would
---
Get schwifty was a jam...
---
builds that soak up rads and play at low health for 'bloodied' benefits, like more damage from bloodied weapons, the adrenal reaction mutation and the nerd rage perk, and special bonuses from unyielding armor.
---
Brain dead? As opposed to standing out in the open and holding down the fire button?
---
If I wanted to play that mindlessly, I'd play Call of Duty or some mobile tapping game. 
---
Yeah, 3-4 shots to the head to kill. By the time that one target is down, their buddies are alerted to where you are and then all your stealth bonuses are gone, so then those 3-4 shots end up being dozens per enemy. Enemies that kill you in two or three hits.
---
You realise that other FPS and RPG games have more than one class and different ways to play other than one, right? And each of those classes have different strengths and weaknesses, right?
---
Or is this your first video game you played?
---
Most developers try and balance each class's strengths and weaknesses, and before this update, most classes and builds were decent enough that you could freely choose what you like.
---
But now in order to remain viable in the game and quests, you expect all of us should play your style of mowing shit down without any thought process involved.
---
Exactly how is that supposed to be fun? 
---
That's the problem. People like you, with builds like you are the ones who were moaning about the game being too easy. The update comes along and your build is still easy. But most of everybody else's builds are now struggling.
---
The update was supposed to balance things between the meta builds one shotting SBQs and everybody else so people could get some hits in and not get left out. The update clearly didn't achieve this. Yeah, you now can't one shot, but need several shots.... But because everybody else had their damage dropped more drastically, they're having even less effect than before and the metas are still chewing everything up.
---
Before the update, the only things I was one shotting were regular mobs out of stealth and medium mobs in stealth. I never could one shot a SBQ or Snallygaster or a Super Sloth, etc., but I was fine with that because those were supposed to be tougher. But I still did a decent amount of damage that I contributed to a team effort.
---
Out of stealth and switching to a combat shotgun, I could take some tough enemies down in 7 hits up close and still survive if I used a couple of stims. Now I need 12 hits from a x2 shot combat shotgun with a stinging MAG, increased damage per consecutive hit and while in sneak to drop a glowing one. That's also with one shotgun Perk card maxed by the way. 
---
x10 rounds per clip, so that means a damn reload before they drop..... That's X24 shotgun rounds to drop a glowing one while in stealth, and most times, I'm already detected before I get to shot 12, so sneak bonuses are gone and then I need to shoot them more. 
---
That sounds fine to you?
---
Sorry but your argument sucks, your little test is garbage, you proved nothing and you clearly miss the point of why some people have issues.
---
The game should balance pros and cons for each weapon and skill, otherwise, what's the point in having those options in the game? Why not just make everyone use the same weapons and same armour?
---
You want to tank and use heavy weapons? Fine.
---
Some people like to medic. Some like to just loot and trade or build or farm.... And Some people like to stealth.
---
I at least accept those differences/preferences and acknowledge there are people having problems that need addressing.
---
But I don't expect you to get it. That would involve thinking too much, I guess.
---
how do i do it
---
Yeah, that's nice but I kinda wanna blow shit up
---
I use a bloodied lever action from stealth, but I also split time with an instigating pipe revolver. The revolver only takes 1 more shot against normal mobs: ghouls, scorched, and super mutants. With adrenaline up it will one-shot headshot most low-tier mobs.
---
If I am fighting something proper tanky, I need the lever action, but I think any anti-armor or instigating rifle will serve people well--obviously junkies too.
---
I think the point is that the stealth bonus, plus adrenal reaction, plus nerd rage gives a lot of boost to the viability of rifles. If you want to be a full health, non-stealth rifleman, you are losing out on a lot of damage. 
---
And that is basically how all new players using rifles are setup to play. It isn't until you get your first suppressor that ideas start to percolate on the viability of becoming a ghost. The next thing you realize is how well instigating fits into stealth tactics.
---
I agree that there is a period of pain before you get a functional build where it almost seems pointless to even run with a rifle compared to an automatic. However, I do think there is an effective mid-tier rifleman build that is still viable.
---
Never knew there was a gym, where
---
 Don’t get hung up on the min/max language.  There are varying degrees of making your character as ‘perfect’ as can be.  Hell I used pretty much any gun I had ammo for until about level 40 or so.
---
Currently I Only have about 12 perk points in strength only that are weapon specific- shotguns and heavy guns.  Literally all my other perks are ‘generalist’.  Soon I will drop/swap my shotguns to focus either shotguns or heavy.  
---
If you aren’t willing to put some perk points towards specific weapons, I don’t think you also get to complain about your weapons not doing enough damage.
---
My guns have no dmg legendary bonuses.  Hell my Gatling is stock.
---
Well that's exactly my issue...
---
So this is... crap?
---
Did between 6 to 10 Daily Ops run thus far, a few times got Elder, still no plans and no rare rewards.
---
That's a cool looking costume, hope it gets re-released again. atm I'm either Sheepsquatch mascot or Mr.Fuzzy
---
For some reason, the game screws up the order all the time, you have to remember yourself which perks occupy which slots. It will come with time :)
---
Yes, the Fancy Pump action Shotgun has a magic effect that's responsible for the high damage. The anti armor part is just the cherry on the cake xD
---
Wrong, if you accidentally shoot someone that isn't on your team in ANY scenario, they can destroy you while Pacifist renders you defenseless. So... why be a pacifist at all?
---
So if you have pacifist on, you can't damage other people.  They can't hurt you as long as you don't hurt them first.  By having pacifist on, you get rid of the chance of hurting them, which gets rid of their ability to hurt you, even if they aren't on pacifist.  Just try not to be in the same workshop as someone else.
---
1000%
---
Well lets see covid 19 more then 100,000 died forcing them to stay home then the ongoing riots burning of cities people getting killed... I don't see the reason for you to complain its just a event it's being replaced with another one
---
Damn that stings, I pray that another one comes your way soon!
---
That's the thing Bethesda wanted to avoid, a lvl 6 can kill a lvl 3000. While in gta a lvl6 can't kill a lvl 100 unless with headshots. I prefer the system we got, it's fairplay and solely depends on your build.
---
I scrapped rank 3 Concentrated Fire and replaced it with rank 1, as well as two ranks of Ground Pounder. Hip fire accuracy is VATS accuracy.  
---
Because of the faster reload from Ground Pounder, i ditched Speed Freak mutation and freed up 3 Luck points by scrapping Class Freak, and I thought I might as well try remove Grim Reaper's Sprint too - this gave me 6 points which i put into Serendipity and Ricochet.  
---
I also took Legendary Strength and levelled it to rank 3 so far, and that gave me 1 rank of Barbarian (with my Unyielding) and 3 ranks of Blocker. Might ditch Barbarian when i have a full set of SS.
---
With Daily Ops, Lone Wanderer is redundant. So am running 6 Charisma which is rank 3 Tenderizer, rank 2 Suppressor, and rank 1 Strange In Numbers. Afaik, Supp/Tend work fine if you don't have Take One For The Team, but idk if Follow Through will bug it out too. Will see.  
---
Might also swap out one piece of Unyielding for a Lifesaving piece, considering one piece seems to be better than rank 3 Mysterious Saviour.
---
*[edit: this worked **awesome**, but my ER is a massive weak point after getting rid of Grounded and Scaly Skin]*
---
*[edit 2: since swapped out some Uny pieces for Bolstering. Total: 2 Uny and 3 Bol. Each Uny piece only drops headshot accuracy by 1%. Prob won't even need the Life Saving piece tbh]*
---
The objective is to get the timer down on the uplinks. More warm bodies make that happen faster. I say bring it low levels. This isn’t an Earle fight.
---
https://i.imgur.com/5hECMIN.jpg
---
Wait what the hell? How do you have a faster reload + vats crit fill, that shouldn't be possible lmao. Those are both minor perks, so they occupy the same (3rd) slot. I'm thinking maybe you have 50% critical shot damage and faster reload?
---
nope. chemist backpack mod literally says, that it doesnt stack with other perks.
---
no
---
I know exactly how it works, because it doesn't work to my benefit, each and every day I use it lol. Only benefits the players I accidentally shoot after an event suddenly ends, especially so after an event like the SB queen when everyone is shooting everything. It's no fun to be a pacifist when someone can just steal all your flux after a boss fight.
---
It does a good job at reducing weight but keeping that many is probably too much 💀 but just a little something to know once your in power armor your gonna have to equip the chem perks, I didn’t learn that for at least 200 levels lol
---
Isn't the most obvious thing be to raise your health a little? Like instead of riding it so close to the line, raise it up to 40%.
---
You're still going to get all the benefits of serendipity when you go below 30% and nerd rage when you go below 20%.
---
The other thing is purely tactical. Are you engaging like 4-6 enemies at once? If so, maybe you should stop doing that and try and engage only 1-2 at a time. If you see more than those 1-2 charge up at you, reposition so you're back down to 1-2. Good tactic is to run around the corner of a building or corridor and lie in wait to ambush. For extra brownie points, drop a mine a bit before you go around the corner so you might kill the first couple before they even come around the corner straight into your ambush.
---
If you're in a situation where you can't avoid being swarmed, use power armour to make yourself a little more durable and drop all notions of stealth and lean into survivability (e.g extra health) or even harder hitting (tenderiser, adrenaline, bloody mess)
---
Also during these tough skirmishes, if you mostly use a sniper rifle sort of weapon, switch to a semi-auto assault rifle to get a high DPS. You use up more bullets but they also should die quicker. 
---
Basic shit like that. It's not really that hard once you get accustomed to it.
---
many of the storyline quest chains reward legendaries
---
I have no idea I just remember seeing cats crit fill on a Tesla and then I swapped to my other on. Its late lol
---
That isn't the same. There's still time investment on Earle, just like there is for Queen. You gotta wait for osmeone to nuke it, and then get a raid group going and kill it. 
---
This is literally....less than 7 minutes, and you're rewarded at least 2 2* or higher legendary pieces for basically AFK'ing in front of a point while enemies funnel at you, while you're also getting lots of ammo and stim and experience. 
---
They don't compare at all, it's not just "ooooh shiny", it's incredibly more efficient to just spam Daily OPs for legendaries. Recently I was told Scorch Queen also gives repair kits, which I wasn't awaare of, so I'm just a tad less worried, but even so, what happens when there's no nuke zones up? People might just keep doing Daily OPs till they're full,and log off. Why do any other event that requires more than one person?
---
I took the terminal out of my camp and haven't added back since.  So useless.
---
Doesn't work that way. Going into caution does not remove your sneak bonuses, going into danger does. Please don't tell me you killed a single mutant and immediately went danger
---
Instead of trying to find it's audience, it should listen to it. They got it right now, but doing things the other way than how we request them or they simply ignoring it won't benefit them at all.
---
Ha, I feel your pain. Especially on the Daily ops where you need to melee to kill. 
---
 Try troubleshooters armor and a magic shotgun. They go down in 2 hits. Butter. Just ran through Hornwrights for the 10 bot kills. Cake walk.
---
Can you get killed while in pacifist mode? If not I don't see the problem
---
sorry, missed your post for some reason. I usually go for torso shots, since I miss the first head one anyway. prior to patch 22 it ended up a net positive, but now I might have to revise my strategy.
---
yeah, it's 6 torso shots on average to kill west tek muties. heads, 3 to 4 I think. it's a pretty standard build, something like this: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5d561dd&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2p00eu0ee2c72ir2l71lt2la2ar2ao0an2a00a12sg2s01lu2lk2lv2cu0cm0am2a70
---
I don't use max adrenaline or gun fu, so that may be it.
---
I wish the Order of Mysteries had daily missions.  Those were fun.
---
This would be fine if they weren't constantly dying or getting pissed that you won't waste the time and stim to revive them because they really are dead weight.
---
Yeah, timer goes down faster but if you look at the overall amount they saved between all the dying, it's not that significant.
---
i have the opposite problem. Join a daily ops team and there is no rest. players are running it over and over. don't even get time to scrip junk drops and it's started again. :)
---
Now I do 2 or 3 runs and leave team.
---
100% have it on all the time. I have to be careful not to use my weapons because I'm an explosive build. 1 out of 3 SBQ fights I lose my flux to a player that kills me for accidentally hitting them in a mob full of enemies... it's gets old.
---
What you saw was really quite simple:
---
You see, they were presenting an offering to the Dealthclaw God (named 'Fluffy'). This deity demanded that the two cultists to 'show me what you've got!'. Unfortunately, the two cultists were unable to 'get schwifty' and so they were executed.
---
Trying to complete the weekly challenges in 2 1/2 days because I can only play on weekends...
---
Doing good events when they appear, like A Real Blast, Leader of the Pack or Distant Thunder, sometimes doing the Crater and Wanderer dailies, collecting shroom flux when someone nukes Fissure Site Prime... But mainly I just go where the challenges need me to be.
---
They need something thats for sure.
---
What, no love for the level 75 assaultrons?
---
Bloodied tse would be too overpowered on certain weapons. Tho with adrenal reaction you're pretty much bloodied so if you have a tse weapon and low health you'll know approximately what the damage output would be
---
But it doesnt kick in until the second shot.
---
Everything is dead within 2 shots anyways.
---
That's why I'm thinking it's useless for a rifleman.
---
Is it somehow giving enhanced damage on the first shot?
---
Agreed, I’ve come around too. And I just got Paladin rank in a team as a berserker, so my worst fears about that build seem unfounded.
---
Just might have to use the railway rifle  now since the ammo perk makes my bloodied one worth it. 
---
Also, I really wish they kept the legendary perks that gave you ranged dmg reduction depending on your armor weight class. If they had I would definitely go guns blazing without PA
---
lol we all have that buddy. coming...just overencumbered, repairing, making ammo...
---
5 minutes later....on my way.. just need some food
---
will end up with people not on your team taking the spot
---
Not even a legendary perk. Just by default. Save the normal perk/legendary perk for a bonus effects like chance to disarm enemies or a lunging dive where if you press the jump button again after you jump, you go into a dive, which gives you defence bonuses during the dive but at the cost of AP.
---
I'm pretty positive you can. It says when you turn it on that your attacks won't engage pvp but that doesn't mean other players can't murder you, or something like that. Usually only happens with a workshop takeover, but I'm seeing a lot more posts like these lately so idk what's going on with PvP right now 🤷
---
I love all assaultrons, regardless of level..... dey sexy :)
---
That's something a commiw would say!
---
They don't bother me as much &amp; usually these miserable floating balls spawn in much larger groups.
---
Taking one for the team and follow threw are both great perks. R1 of funky dudes turns lvl 100 poison floaters attacks into a tickle, excited to see what r2 does
---
Exploding palm is the only I think to be worth a slot because it has a chance to proc per hit, not only on death
---
Todd Howard coughs lightly to get everyone’s attention, but it doesn’t work because we’re too busy server hopping for a new dupe glitch. He’s starting to get irate, because we’re abusing a bug that for a long time had been to the player’s detriment but we figured out a way to flip it to benefit us, and as his face starts to turn red, he morphs into an ethereal divine being of near limitless capabilities and he yells with all his Godd Howardly Power “CHRISTMAS IS CANCELLED BECAUSE YOU’RE ALL A BUNCH OF FILTHY DUPERS!” Everyone stops their duping, and turns around to look at Godd Howard. Then people who pretend like they weren’t guilty start to whinge and bitch because the Great Godd Howard cancelled Christmas when Disciple DemonAsylum betrayed Godd’s son Paul and had him crucified for our sins by the Shareholders of ZeniMax. They whinged and they duped, then they bitched and duped some more. Godd Howard even banished everyone from Appalachia for the Christmas period as punishment for our sins, while none could be punished more harshly for it was a camp dupe. And so the story of why Christmas was cancelled goes.
---
I don't have problems taking them down. They are just so stressful to deal with, I hear two pew pew's and suddenly I'm half health and there's 6 of the round bastards.
---
99% of the time it's just for boosts while you solo. Any interaction between team mates is coincidental
---
People are stupid look at the freeway at 5pm.
---
I didnt see it or read it.  I just know my brother tells me about it
---
I have heard there is an exploit with one of the legendary perk cards, buy the wording on this post made it seem like he didn't have pacifist mode switched on. 
---
Obviously if you take a work shop you engage in PvP, other than that with pacifist mode turned on you should be safe
---
The purveyor is just a chill old lady
---
Dude... lol... duuuuuude... I dont think you're understanding. Are you on PC or Console?
---
I'm not experiencing this in workshops. I dont even mess with workshops anymore, I have too much junk lol. If you dont understand what I'm saying... and if you're on PS4... put Pacifist on, shoot me with an explosive weapon, and I will kill you in game... That's it. You wont be able to defend yourself, and that's the issue I'm having with Pacifist mode. Me and 6 other people have been accustomed to this since the beginning.
---
Pretty much do your own thing, unless you join Daily Ops, in which case y'all should (in theory) be doing the daily ops together 👍
---
Except it hasn't, I honestly played 3, nv, and 4 as if they were fps with rpg elements and the only time I ever had trouble is if my character didn't have a speech check do to low stats. Which was fine. Yes if you perked for one thing only youd have a easier time but your limited in play style. If fallout or skyrim was meant to be so classed based as you seem to claim it be hard locked like other rpgs or mmos. 
---
As for legendary stealing, you mean whats actually gotten worse since the update? Uranium fever is nothing but trying to beat the three dudes who don't care if anyone else gets a hit in, get your hit and emote its location. By then the poor sobs who are far away usually don't get a hit in because even though those who used to farm events like this still do everyone a courtesy and let them get ahead in those who don't care just ruin it for everyone.
---
By the last shot, due to increased perception, they're usually right on top of me and detected, so yeah.... Danger appears, and because that one enemy triggered danger, all other surrounding enemies know where I am, so sneak is gone.
---
The only way to take them all out in stealth solo now is to be really far away, shoot one once, wait for caution to go back to hidden and then take another shot. Rinse and repeat.
---
That takes forever and isn't fun.... And a game is supposed to be fun, last I checked anyways.
---
So all one can do now if either slog through the above, or completely change to a totally different build and play completely different to how you wanted to and how you've been playing since the damn game launched.
---
I usually like to be in power armor only for combat because my weight goes from able to carry 400 down to 200
---
Hand over the stimpacks or give me your pc it’s a simple choice
---
“I’ll think about it” is my code for ‘it’s not gonna happen. But then again, you do have a small chance of me actually doing it. Just assume it won’t and it’ll be a nice surprise if it does!”
---
I, as a high level player, welcome anyone who just sits on the objective. It's all about getting the time down, and I can handle the enemies solo. I just can't make the timer move faster without the extra bodies on point.
---
I haven't been inside Valley Galleria since the update.  Did they fix the music?
---
You can still be killed in pacifist mode though
---
One of my friends has over 1200 carry cap
---
These legendary perks were disappointing. Along with a lot of this new stuff in the update. They need to stop adding onto already existing places and add NEW areas to this game. I still have urges to play but there’s nothing to do after you hit lvl 205
---
Tbh once the elder rank is achieved I do ammo runs that consist of 30 minutes or so of farming enemies for ammo.  Today I collected 2400 flamer fuel in 30 minutes.  For the weapons that drop random ammo, switch to those for the boss every op you run ..
---
I have that one on my melee guy as well.  Also not proccing often at all
---
Hy ! Because they don't read the team objective...can be...I did it alone so many times 🚀
---
PA glitch. I haven’t destroyed a core or fixed a pipe in a year 😃
---
This has always been the case and remains after patch 22. Just grab the broken one, repair it and turn the quest in. No need to waste time getting the other 2 👍
---
The today’s daily op can easily done solo. Did it a couple of times solo under 8 minutes.   
---
there could be a couple of reasons why the others didn’t want to join the daily.
---
* doing a event
---
* just finished another run
---
* waiting for a event to start
---
* got out of ammo
---
* etc
---
I understand that, I know there has been exploits in the past that made it possible but they have all been patched  out now. The main post was saying he didn't have pacifist mode on. So getting killed in PvP was only fair.
---
Mines still there as a decoration, but since they recycled it for the ammo converter I might get rid
---
Dual weilding in general should be a thing
---
Okay. This is getting ridiculous. One kill and you are in danger? You are either running some very weird build that has nothing to do with sneak or you are not using a suppressed weapon. Or you are not pressing crouch button but you are thinking you are sneaking. I play sneak as well and one kill danger does not happen unless you are doing something very, very stupid
---
Ya I'm pretty much in the same boat. I have everything I want and I have nothing to work towards. If it wasn't for Nuclear Winter keeping me entertained, I probably would've quit 76 a year ago.
---
Ugh. I cannot. Write. Bethesda.. Again... *cough* deth
---
That's a good idea, id love to see that.
---
I was a fresh level 12 when I first saw it.
---
It’s a sad thing for sure :/ such good music to vibe to
---
Ahh ty for that! 😀 looks similar to the Croc one, but with a Gorilla.
---
great, an oppurtunity to tell your brother hes wrong :D  
---
[here a random pic i found](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgX6Rs2UwAQTJ9h.jpg)
---
I guess you have not encountered Encryptid yet. That’s pretty brutal too.
---
Same here man
---
&gt;I want the community opinion on this stuff,1- Do you guys still think it's still worth it trying to make this game good? (I Think so so enjoyable)
---
Honestly not with Bethesda at the helm. They've demonstrated that they have some moments of brilliance but it's surrounded by too much mismanagement and incompetence. What we have now is likely going to be about as good as it gets. Everything from here on out will at best be incremental improvements in my mind.
---
&gt;2- Shroud is really taking FO76 side by saying "It's better than the release", Maybe this will bring more attention to the Game or to Bethesda?
---
Saying it's better than release isn't really saying much at all. I think word of mouth will have more of an impact but there has to be the foundation of a good game and a competent dev and we don't really have either right now.
---
Better than release on both fronts but, like I said, that's not saying much.
---
&gt;3- How about the community making an list of the game biggest problem and officially sending it to Bethesda, in my belief the more we Criticize the more aware the Dev's be of what is bothering us, and if the whole community make such a list, maybe we can really make this game be Good
---
We've done that so many time and we've brought them up over and over to the point that there is a rule for this sub specifically to stop people from constantly posting about it. Check out the sub's list of required posts and you'll see, not only that we've done this very thing you've suggested but a good chunk of them have gone unaddressed for many months or even years.
---
The problem isn't that the devs don't know. They just don't care or don't consider it a priority or have their hands tied by exec management so even if they wanted to and were capable of doing so, they can't.
---
It’s just a theory, it’s a localised incident and every other time my camp hasn’t loaded in it’s been because of a tent or another CAMP. It’s only not loaded into a seemingly empty area once. The presence of the mole rats could just be coincidence.
---
I don't think that's true tho?  It says right on the screen when you turn pacifist on, other players can still murder you. It also says on Bethesda that while in pacifist, it's just harder for others to kill you, but not impossible. 
---
I see what you're saying that it sounds like OP wasn't in pacifist and i agree. But you're also saying you can't be killed by another player in pacifist and based on what I'm reading, i don't think that's true. It may be a lot harder to, but it can still happen, exploit or not.
---
I think the source of the issue is online games evolve - FO76 is somewhere between your single player FO4 and a true MMO like WoW. The single player game is a onetime revenue generator... Until you release an expansion. But FO76 was intended to generate atom Shop and FO1st revenue. So we have some divide among the player base - those who keep feeding coins into the game, and those who don't. I have invested a total of $50, max, by buying 2 heavily discounted copies of the game. I never bought atoms and I don't subscribe. For this I have played hundreds of hours - despite its many flaws, I am happy with my investment and generally willing to adapt with each new uodate, usually becuase with the bad, also comes new content and some needed fixes.
---
I a subscriber paying $8-12 per month, or spent $50 or $100 extra in the atom store, I'd feel I'd want to either get more more my investment: fix the damn bugs, add more content, more weapons, more playable builds, etc. If I'd spend a hundred on atoms becuase I was mainly a base builder, then I may mostly want new content for building, better foundation and pre-built meshing, ceilings, 1x1 stairs, the ability to float upper storeys without crazy exploits, more camp budget and more building content in general.
---
The dilemma here is the endgame players were wanting more content for them and super high dmg builds needed adjustment. One wasteland seemed like a good way to increase the challenge for the most powerful players, but still allow the much larger number of people who were also in the endgame content, but were still a long way from one-shot kills on bosses.
---
The people who got left out were the casual camp builders and low level players who weren't launching nukes and didn't join the SBQ battles or Earle raids. They still had a ways to go before they needed to worry abt a build and the legendary grind, or they weren't interested in the combat aspect.
---
They are all players and all valid player styles in FO76. The goal is to make it a win for everyone as much as possible. It's not a zero sum game - some dude building a freakshow carnival near the Slocum Joe's doesn't take away from my play, nor does the lvl 30 noob running around Charleston doing responders quests. We got a big boost in content and balance, some fixed, I think it's okay to ask Bethesda to work on balance for the casual and low level players who felt screwedby one wasteland.
---
My stealth build which my most time went into hits hard, is slow combat compared to others, is a bit weaker taking damage wise. But the back up pistol I had even with the armor penetration from my rifleman perks no longer can be used as a standby gun. Quad automatic 10mm used to shred mole miners in 8-15 rounds during  uranium fever. Now it takes a full mag unless all headshots and even then its depleting ammo like ice on summers metal slide.
---
My go to for cooping with cousin, the fancy shotgun used to be strong enough to not need dmg bonus perks. Now it takes almost all rounds even with head shots to down ghouls and scorched. The only way to get any potential from it is vats because of concentrated fire lol. My 10 mm smg with explosives rounds, multiple damage perks and armor penetration (not sure if exploding rounds negate that though) and it melt enemies and ammo, I use it as my back up when commando is my main! Now its a full mag dump chest and face of weaker enemies... Used to be able to confidently roam the asylum and now two to three hits im dead.
---
You think I should swap melee for shotguns?
---
Daily ops has actually made my back up character feel useful, a healer. I love just catching everything on fire. The enemies. The walls. The floor. My team. It's great. I just love the fact most of my perks matter since they are close enough to me lol. Daily ops has been one of the best things added to the game. 
---
Not to mention i always leave with more ammo than i went in with.
---
It’s the opposite of auto complete without score! Free ranks!
---
It better not mess with the silos.
---
You can't go over 90% in any way.
---
I just sell the stimpacks to the vendor bots, they are the higher level purified water pretty much... 😂
---
Been playing since Beta. I must like it.
---
if im not mistaken its because certain enemies have armor, so if it was an anti armor weapon it would do more damage to it
---
Seriously. Half the comments are like 
---
"You DARE to try and play this game casually! You only play for a few hours a week and have a life outside of the game!? How dare you try to have fun and not spend every second of the day min-maxing just to survive in the game! This is the intended experience! Fucking filthy casual!"
---
They fail to realise that new players shouldn't be forced to min-max the game in order to enjoy it, that kind of thing should only be necessary for the end game. You can defend the game by saying that it isn't unbalanced and that this was intended all you want but you will be wrong. Bethesda's stated goal was to make it easier for higher level and low level players to play together. They have achieved exactly the opposite of that since only optimised builds are viable now.
---
you can do all that, while paying attention to the pitfalls and dangers about.
---
But to continually complain and want a change at the expense of players that are prob core base who want a better / tougher wasteland experience is whiny brat behavior.
---
I actually enjoyed the beta more then I enjoy the “finished” version but it’s still addictive
---
ha! I'm waiting for people to half read the title and start hitting me with "It was doing that last month!"
---
i dont play in pacifist mode because i just play pvp in case to kill a player wanted. i dont see fair be killed just cause i am not in pacifist mode. thats whys bethesda put that you need to shoot back to begin the match. this is a exploit. need to be fixed. End of discurssion
---
&gt;Shotguns: Fixed an issue affecting Suppressor Shotgun Mods that could cause the weapon’s range value to be negative.
---
Is this not a hint that shotgun range is broken?
---
I follow some lowers around and help them with xp by shooting but not killing enemies so they can grind faster. Gets boring though and I don't think some know what I am doing.
---
I ruined it for you!! Mwhahahaha!!!
---
The only way you should be able to be killed by another player is because of one of three things
---
1- you have a bounty
---
2- you choose to retaliate when killed for your bounty
---
3- workshop based PvP 
---
Anything else is an exploit now as Bethesda have done everything they can to prevent "greifers"
---
That tip was from launch, they have updated it so others can’t scratch you when you’re on pacifist.
---
NEITHER WAS I
---
but i wasnt in pvp and that is the problem
---
Do you have the Tank Killer perk card equipped to get through their armour?
---
Very few people actually play as a team. Friend groups might but for the gen pop, absolutely not. They're all mostly solos.
---
The only caveat is when there are tent pole events like SBQ or ACP. There people act more like a team (though not necessarily within their team) but it's more informal. You see something that needs addressing and you address it. Revive people who are downed. Help keep trash mobs away from big damage dealers. That kind of thing.
---
You even see some take a hit in terms of XP and loot and go complete objectives like mining ore for Radiation Rumble but very few people do this. There's no incentive to. It's better for that event to fail because you focussed down all the waves of ghouls vs actually successfully completing the event. The chump is the guy getting the ore.
---
what is it exactly? an exterminators bash 50drwa variant is still a fixer but...nah, you know :)  
---
just got scrip and 2 rare plans (94 jumpsuit and liquid courage recipe) i will never use so far. but there are a lot of days to come :)
---
According to the youtube experts all the explosive legendary perks are shit.
---
You probably can't ever go wrong with the special perks tho.
---
It had to happen. The damage before was unsustainablw. Now they need to make it right by tweaking and buffing.
---
Yep all they have to do is get you to keep coming back. Just like AA
---
Casual team is definitely “do your own thing”, but I’ve found people on the Events team generally casually swarm together every time an event pops up. Hopefully people use Daily Ops properly and leave it if they’re not waiting to go into one...
---
Firstly assault rifle is one of the lower tier auto rifle weapons but also there's a rubber banding bug with explosive effects.
---
If you see either delayed movement from health or the health bounce up and down, that's the bug in action.
---
I love it too 😍
---
I read in another thread that pacifist mode keeps you safe, thankfully. It’s apparently caused by one of the legendary perks, Take one for the team I think
---
It's all enemies even small creatures
---
Your post was a little hard to understand, though for then to kill you you must have done damage to them or one of their team mates. Or did you have a bounty?
---
VATS, and Healing bug for starters. Those have been around forever.
---
Who uses Tenderizer or Suppressor anyway?
---
can I hire you for my shooting gallery? 🤣 https://youtu.be/Tn0d4hDJKmA
---
Shotguns, rifles and some pistols are currently the worst weapons. Balancing the game around them would loose fo76 more players then it gains. I would be happy if they fix the shotgun bugs and rebalance those weapons but as long as it is the way it is you'll either optimize your build or pick something else. You can make shotguns work with magic damage or bloodied vats usage for example.
---
Exactly! Parent Speak...we understand it!
---
your build needs work. stealth is still viable. obviously not in ops. shotguns in vats are still 1/2 hits to kill, even on level 100. few more shots outside vats. 
---
you can change it up as well.
---
Yes I like doing it with teams it’s a lot easier but I end up most of the time doing it alone under the 8 minutes
---
I will give this a try and let you know how it goes.
---
Don't believe it bud I did every challenge last time and just made some slight changes to my play, used the exp boost from cranberry relish and kept rested well up all times and all that int boosting jazz and I ended up finishing a month before end, was kinda letdown when I realised I had nothing to work towards. Now I'm using just cranberry and inspirational, I dont want to finish too early but I reckon people will be surprised with how much exp they are actually getting nowadays with ops and levelled up enemies
---
Edit: never mind, but that is still a good fixer
---
2 is certainly going smoother, more dailies to complete, easier NW things right off the bat. It is much easier than it had been last time.
---
I’m not even a parent and I’ve mastered it already. This is what happens when you agree to look after your neighbor’s kids and they end up liking you more than their dad.
---
I knew I wasnt getting  the most out of the guns because of the way I was built, I was getting 115 ish out of deathclaw gauntlet and just over 100 on my combat shotgun and that was fine for what I was doing now I might as well use a rolling pin or a bow for the damage they cause.
---
What level were you before ?
---
Ahhh the elusive Proxy Parent. Use you powers wisely....or for evil. Who am I to tell you how to live! :)
---
Found it from a players vending machine
---
The only powers I have are a crippling chocolate addiction made worse by stress!
---
LOL I think we all have one like that!
---
sorry about my english, i am brasilian. what i said was that i dont play in pacifist mode cause i want to kill people who has a bounty. but, i dont play pvp in other cases. and i founded a guy who was killing me even before i hit him to start pvp. and he doesnt had any bounty.
---
This is a thing unfortunately.....even between people on the same team. If just one has the “take one for the team” legendary perk and pacifist off they can kill or be killed with no return fire. A mate of mine tested this out by “accidentally” shooting and killing their friend whilst on a team. Somehow got wanted for doing that as well....
---
I joined a team yesterday and by the time I spawned in they were just finishing up... barely had to fire a shot for that elder rank, sweet 😅
---
Do you know what your builds are? Min-maxing isn't necessary but you want to kind of have an idea of what your combat playstyle is, also are you modding your weapon? Most weapons need certain mods to really shine
---
Soloed at 60.. wasnt no thang.. then again im a full health two handed melee so it was a breeze
---
The community has been very very very very very vocal of the games biggest problems. Plural. 
---
It often falls on deaf ears.
---
Wait so you’re saying if you join a world by accident that doesn’t place your camp and leave to load into another world your camp will spawn on the new one?
---
I went from 4&gt;14 [I've uploaded a video](https://twitter.com/sciencepie/status/1307217153284857857?s=20) on my twitter (wasn't sure how here)
---
I’m not here arguing if it had to be done, in fact I agree that other comparable game don’t use multiplicative damage calculation either for a good reason.
---
I’m just here telling you wrong your predictions were.
---
Your condescending attitude towards players that enjoy making powerful characters and min maxing is irritating to say the least.
---
You are being as much of douche as are the bloodied players who one shot legendaries and call casuals “foodbuilds”
---
We shouldn’t be telling people how to play their game. Especially when they are paying for a private world in order to do so.
---
You don’t like speccing to maximize your combat effectiveness. We get it. Don’t force that play-style over us with some sort self righteous lectures about how you are seeking a challenge and others are just abusing broken mechanics.
---
Ciao
---
I got it twice in a row capturing the workshops around the map for the weekly 
---
I'm pretty sure one of them dropped in the power station workshop in the northeast of the mire, the one right on the lake
---
Didn't they add new locations in 22?
---
Welp looks like a bug lol. Yea its definitely not the worst thing in the world but also maybe its randomly triggered. Who knows yet. 
---
Good job reporting it. If anyone asks dont tell them what you were doing beforehand except Beth employees.
---
Our honest opinions are... its not a shitty game, thats why we play it... sure its buggy and grindy, but if it was shitty we wouldnt play it
---
Gotcha. Thanks guys. I was searching all over bc everything I was reading was contradictory to this. I even found some recent articles in regards to pacifist and how it works and they make no mention of the 3 items you listed above, just that it's harder to kill you but if someone really wanted to put in the time &amp; effort they could.
---
But I've got 2 people here now telling me that's false, so I'll take your words for it! Thanks for the info guys 😊
---
yeah my 1st time was very difficult.
---
only launched on my 3rd attempt. 
---
You will get it it down soon enough. Then it's a simple run. just takes 20 - 25minutes.
---
a good idea is to have a silo loadout. and don't forget Refractor perk in perception
---
If I've the objective set to casual, it's just sort of whatever. It boosts XP globally, so you can do what you feel like and still get benefits from the group. If lower levels join, I'll try to share some cards that benefit them too. 
---
There are really only upsides to being in a group, honestly. You can get theoretically much better benefits than lone wanderer with none of the perk investment.
---
They never updated pacifist modes description, but it was changed last year.
---
Do you have the ‘taking one for the team’ perk on? If you’re on a team anybody can walk up and kill you, it’s a known bug that they’ll hopefully fix soon. Not because of exploding rounds because I use them and can’t pvp anyone not engaging
---
Happen to me dude joned my public team left public team an killed me while I was modding my weapons thn blew up my house. Was pretty cool
---
Your build needs to min/maxed in terms of damage. Pick a gun and build your perks around that gun type.
---
It was bsss before, but right now there isnt rly much difference so i go with my aa one.
---
Lol no surprise there, that it was never updated. Thank you!
---
If i could roll a Bloodied shotty id be a god aswell
---
This I understand, I have heard somewhere about a bug with one of the legendary perks, this is clearly a bug. The OP made no sense though. Thanks.
---
Can confirm, if you want to this is a really good way
---
Did a couple of daily ops last night and went from 400+ ammo to 2.2k+
---
TSE should be better, but good luck getting it.
---
You can join Daily Ops while over encumbered. Unless you meant you didn't want to join because your encumberence would be a detriment.
---
I’m 19. My pancreas is being ravaged because of this... Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
Take a flamer next time with a good amount of fuel 
---
Melts assaultrons in like 3 seconds, if you're dying before you get in range, try maxing the serendipity perk under luck 
---
If you're still not making it, try also grabbing the dodgy perk under agility, unless you're using power armor, then ignore that 
---
If you're using power armor, make sure you have the emergency protocols mod on your chestpiece
---
If you can close the gap to get in their with a flamer, you should be fine
---
Alternatively, grab the perks for whatever weapon type you're using that boost limb damage, and take out their legs first and then try and cripple the head before they can shoot their death ray
---
Same, its not that bad. Except On Violent Night. I couldn’t do that event, just too much
---
Play or don't. That's the only choice to make. It's a simple thing. Bitching about it to other players solves nothing.
---
I understand there is frustration with the changes. No one is being forced to play. If someone isn't having fun playing maybe it's time to take a break.
---
A MIRV. Better spread. More likely to hit more than one player.
---
Thanks, im currently running it, but im thinking of speccing out of it, my heavy weapons just dont break down currently...
---
The one that makes you run faster if on team - get to points faster
---
They’re just saying that they should be able to not have pacifist mode on - the specific example was to kill wanted people.........
---
It’s the lack of some punctuation and slight reordering of normal word order that makes it hard to read.....not meaning to sound old here, but that seems to be how younger people write now. I even read an article recently saying that full stops are considered intimidating now (I guess because they are additional where a structure is already imposed by the messaging map)
---
I got a quad explosive fixer the other day. Daily ops rewards have been good to me so far
---
sorry. my english is not good enough
---
That's too bad it's been such a great year so far.😬
---
LMAO
---
I imagine post-war weed is killer, in more ways than one.
---
Take a hit, "oh shit I got gills!"
---
How did ye know ye got the last recipe?
---
Explosions do 20% of the damage dealt by the weapon. This is erroneously reflected in pip boy damage and is misleading to casuals like yourself. We can work backwards to find out your on-hit and explosive damage.
---
X × 1.2 = 32
---
X = 26.66 on-hit damage
---
32 - 26.66 = 5.34 explosive damage.
---
Yeah, your tiny explosive damage will get reduced to nothing by anything with an inkling of armor.
---
Ie: An enemy with 5 DR will reduce this by 50% to about 2.7 damage. An enemy with 80% damage reduction and 400 DR will reduce this to &lt;1.
---
Try boosting your damage. This will, in turn, boost the explosive damage.
---
That would be so fuckin' cool but I bet it's because these take place indoors and those fellas are pretty big. Even if they were forced to spawn in an open area of the level(like the center area of the mall) I would imagine their bulk would still keep them from moving around well(getting stuck on objects and such), so it would make cheesing them too easy.
---
But I would love to be proven wrong on this in a future Daily Op update.
---
I'm cool with Fallout 76's community as long as I don't start hearing "Git gud" even if they are dismissive of criticism. LOL
---
I usually use the Atoms on the board like a free space, or move ahead.
---
Cos they dun care?
---
I create a daily ops group, get joiners, explain on mic im changing to casual to get mobs xp and will change back to daily ops before final boss. Then immediately switch back to casual after we finish. I think that's the most efficient
---
Same. +1
---
It's not that English was bad it's was because you where complaining about being killed when you didn't have pacifist mode turned on.
---
Even if you're having a easy time weapon and gear wise I noticed something while testing my main vs my main "coop" character besides the hugs scaling issues. 
---
Enemies are more likely to aggro even one floor up or below you if one sees you. While in the asylum it was worse then the missions in the capitol where the dmt bots are. If you cant lose aggro they will eventually all converge to your floor if path finding allows it! Last week you could be guns blazing and they'd have trouble knowing you were there unless on your floor or directly above or below. 
---
This brings the second part, their fight or flight mechanics. Im not sure if this is the issue but it seems with them all being higher levels they share the same need to aggro or run away. I maybe wrong here but if they're all way more aggressive this may be contributing to them all swarming even if they haven't seen you. They didn't chain aggro as bad as it seems now, or maybe its just that they're overly more aggressive? Which means areas they weren't meant to be able to prior, are all fair game.
---
Resistance, days of varying disease chances are gone, if you had a 15 24 and 40 enemy each has a different chance to inflict disease right? Now that they all are essentially the highest chance of spreading said disease it means we are being infected at higher rates. Perks and chems can mitigate this but it still makes probability far higher. Went from rarely needing disease cures to using 11 in a day and only replenishing 3 because of pharma farma.
---
Etc.
---
If you wonder what the hell I mean coop main, its the one I normally reserve for when playing with my cousin. So we can try to keep things close and structured, experience everything for first time like a coop game.
---
I haven't even attempted sbq or the indigo Colossus yet because we restarted presbq on those character slots so we could experience wastelanders yet my main is nearing 300 lol.
---
yes, should be that so.
---
PSA: if you have such a problem with the subreddit, maybe find a different sub.
---
Are you sure it wasnt lvls u already had? I had it happen today but i didnt gain anything extra. It just started going from 1-14 but i was already 13 before that happened.
---
What is the prefix of your assault rifle?
---
No I don't think I will.
---
Yeah, once I figured this out I stopped wasting a ton of ammo.
---
lol. they have got to be the highest ranged damage dealers in the game.  Have u noticed their bullets have a solid thunk to them?
---
WHY IS THIS THING NOT DYING!!!??....
---
VATS has combat inhibitor locked... at 0%......
---
dead. again. OMG Concentated Fire perk wtf!!!
---
rage quit.  that's me usually
---
Some a high levels can be absolute bro’s and can help you out like one did to me I was level 30 and he dropped me a bunch of ammo that I was in dire need for
---
They're not rewriting the ammo counter system and adding in an enormous amount of animations. This will take many months to do
---
Edit:
---
 You can keep asking for this, but keep in mind that it will come at the cost of story and playable content being pushed back or watered down more than it already is
---
Daily ops should have a lobby solely for this like nuclear winter.
---
Can you get legendary gear everytime you play?
---
I'll probably pay more if its a BALLS outfit. Cant imagine seeing balls running around in the game for once.
---
thanks
---
Was Junkies really nerfed that hard? Serious question here. Cause my main is a Junkies heavy gunner and I haven't really noticed much of a difference.
---
I want to wear two boxing gloves and pummel some mofos.
---
From what I understand, no.
---
the  magic weapon are not hit but the weapon that not are not magic are hit hard
---
There was literally a post on the top of the subreddit yesterday proving mathematically that the enemies have become sponges.
---
Electric absorption and power armor are your friend.
---
1. yes  
---
2. junkie didnt got nerfed. the whole damage calculation was changed and nobody will have the high damage numbers as before. if you want to change your build, go on but a proper build works fine as before.
---
I just went back and looked at board and you're absolutely right, thanks! I already had wieght bench (rank 5) placed at camp and remember claiming log door so there's no way I went up that many levels at once!
---
Because nobody on the PTS had the balls to PVP with me. They'd log out in literal fear when I picked locks at their camps.
---
I never once saw a player at a workshop or received a PVP handshake - they're all Pacifists.
---
They never would have caught this because they're the types of players who want to see PVP completely stripped from the game, and it is incredibly ironic that this was the result.
---
I didn't even know you get kicked out of ops if you get kicked thats awful
---
Hoax? On PC, there are many hundreds of hacked weapons. Miniguns that fire mini nukes and the like apparently.
---
I’m struggling as well because I don’t know how to make good builds. When I get attacked by ghouls they are always in packs of like what feels like ten
---
I got level 4 because stealth is my jam and I knew I'd always have a place for it. It's better suited for sustained DPS, so commando is really the sweet spot. It also makes bows more viable, as well as the suppressed pistol (and with the accuracy and range of a western revolver a good gunslinger can get a lot more work out of that from stealth than you might expect.) Rifleman probably gets the least benefit, though it still comes in handy for the odd sheepsquatch and whatnot. It's nice to have that "executioner" upgrade on subsequent shots where the instigating weapons always fell short, even if you don't need it all the time. I also love the rad perk though. It's nice to feel clean again. If you're a dedicated sniper you might find that more practical (especially if you're rocking vanguard solar armor), but because follow through is so flexible it's definitely a worthwhile investment if you like to switch up your stealth tactics.
---
I'm pretty sure very time I've done it I have. Even after I did the once daily rewards
---
Hay I'm only 31 and I hate poor language skills. I constantly pull my kids up for use of bad grammer or punctuation. 
---
I get frustrated sometimes with "bug" posts because half the time it's not even a bug. 
---
There are two things that come to mind regarding this post. 
---
1- should have had pacifist mode on ( harsh but true)
---
2- if it is a bug you need to be more specific about the details of the event.
---
I don't think my main weapons are magic. To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the whole "magic weapon" thing. As far as I know you need a piece of armor with the less damage while blocking or something like that. Pretty sure I don't have one of those, and if I'm using my .50 Cal MG or minigun I'm in PA anyways.
---
so you think is fair being killed by anyone, by any time, without even doing anything?
---
It does get easier..this sounds like my 1st silo run.at the end all my ranged ammo was either gone or my guns had all broken had to finish the launch room with a assualtron blade.lol
---
God now I wish explosive plasma caster was a thing lol
---
thats not survive mode
---
I have 1

you are missing entitled brat syndrome

I just liked the option to hang out in low hassle zones when I wanted.

You may want to pop in to the now xp-stacked grafton steel. Easily comparable to wes tek once you learn the layout, and no loading screens.
---

---
All I'm saying is, full pirate outfit whilst dual wielding a black powder pistol and a dirk. 
---
I'd start a new build.
---
Taking one for the team doesn't work solo in a public team, I don't know for inspirational perk
---
Only affects physical explosives.
---
Im level 91 and this is the best time I had in a long time. Game is finally challenge and not a walk through the park, as it was before. I understand, that some people do not want to bother themselves with meta min maxing, but come on, its not to read guide or two and build casual usefup build. Yeah, you wont be oneshoting bosses, but I dont believe, that anyone is "struggling" against trash mobs. More like butthurt, that now they must shoot three times, instead of one and lost their feeling of superiority.
---
I thought I had it bad when I went to check my Radaway supplies and found I had somehow accumulated 800 standard and 400 diluted!
---
Yeah, I'm convinced they abuse the magic weapon gimmick too.
---
Tip though, leave the combat inhibitor, focus on the thrusters.
---
Not your xbox or connection.
---
it's that specific server that has an issue.
---
had it twice last night. so annoying. once at launch prep, then later again at SBQ.
---
needed to server hop then,
---
My theory is that server needs a refresh/reboot
---
I'm a  new level 24 player. What big thing happens when you reach level 50?
---
What do people expect to happen? We didn't change the game. It's like complaining to Fido because prices on dog food just went up.
---
Adapt or quit. Take a break if it's too stressful.
---
Like people rushing on top of the body which you are looting and cancelling your looting. So annoying.
---
Np, i was confused as hell when it happened, hopefully they fix it cuz itll get real annoying going to scoreboard everytime i rank up.
---
Pretty sure it says it does not
---
yep. it will be standing in the same spot.
---
One in the second floor of the main building in the WV lumber company
---
I think 7:55 was my closest so far.
---
Uh I use tenderizer, it's pretty good now imo
---
junkies weapon with more then 200 firerate are also magic
---
Right. But don't you need that armor piece to get it to proc?
---
But this is the thing - I know Jack shit about character "builds" and the game does fuck all to explain it or help. Realistically, I shouldn't need to constantly be consulting strategy guides and stuff. There is a leveling up and perk system here that should be taken at face value, but apparently it can't and there's certain magic combos of perks and levels that only some players know, and without those progressing in the game is several times harder than it has been in previous fallout games with similar in game settings.
---
inspirational works for sure. and im pretty sure angryturtle tested the taking one for the team and said, it works solo teamed also. or did i get that wrong?
---
Before or after update 22?
---
It was never good, never will be.
---
Honestly for me I have some gear that I have hoarded that I dont use on my bloodied build that I will just transfer via private world.around level 50 plus is when you can really start to fix your build...moving perks around and having a decent build makes the game alot easier..
---
If your on xbox I have a mutants handmade and mutants combat rifle I can pass to you isnt the best but its +10 damage if mutated along with some armor I outgrown if you want it pm me.
---
I've been looking for a quad Tesla for ages. Not too worried about the other effects as I want to try out the auto barrel. Not much use with just 15 in the mag.
---
I used to see things that way until I spent years working around Eastern Europe (most places between Germany and Turkey). I realised early on that differences are not just due to words being in a different language, even sentence structures can be very different....you quickly get used to that though and that’s why English people working in Holland or Germany, for example, end up speaking with a host country “accent” (words in English, sentence structure local). 
---
Saying “player wanted” rather than “wanted player”, for example, is the most common way I’ve seen outside of English - it would be how it would be written in the original language before translation. 
---
I guess I think we should be tolerant of that considering literally billions of people speak English as a second language and maybe 100s of millions as a first language don’t live in US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and UK.....the language is being shaped by them now
---
\~3% is better than 0,015% you'll get it eventually
---
Legendary perks tested part 3 at 7m50 : it doesn't work solo on a public team....
---
If your weapon has bash damage then it can be magic. I think you need the armor piece If the weapon doesn’t have the bash damage effect.
---
No loading screens for west tek either
---
In general, most criticism is fine. The bad mostly comes from people spamming the same thing over and over again, starting a new post about something when there are already 5 for that thing that day, or posting about a very, very specific and minor thing they wish the game had and acting like the game is unplayable without it or that the devs are idiots or evil because it's not there.
---
As someone who works in Game dev, there's a decent amount of good criticism here, and then there are some critiques, ideas and opinions that are unusable as feedback or not well thought out from a realistic perspective. Development and Design isn't magic and far too many people don't think about how things would actually work, how those additions or changes would affect other systems and how varied the reception of the audience would actually be for it. Too many people see only their experiences and issues affecting them directly as the only things that are important. It's not invalid, but some people don't think much past their own wants when it comes to how things should be. If something is bad for them, then the devs are bad, the people who don't care about that thing or that disagree are shills, and the 1500 hours they put into the game are ruined now and forever and they'll never play the game again. Those "end of the world" types are just useless to the development of the game.

yeah *apparently*.
---
quod erat demonstrandum
---
Daily ops is good for the end rewards if you can finish it quickly. Other than that just out and about in the game. Hoards will always have a 3 star, awol also has a legendary at the end
---
Trying to solo daily ops with the shit hear that most of us have is flat out impossible. You can’t hide from the enemies, and they gun you down so SO fast
---
I don’t speak pasta.
---
Why not ask Reddit? We would love to play daily op together
---
Unfortunately this seems to have been an issue for a long time now, but Bethesda never seems to address it in any patches or ITVs. I really with they'd fix it, as the short time I had Fallout 1st, I couldn't have my friends join me on the private server, which kind of defeated the whole point of having access to it for me.
---
Well then, I’ve spent way to long rebuilding my bases because I never realised that. Rip.
---
your loss (but you can use Google I am sure)
---
I noticed some people are trying to get ya with locked containers at their CAMPs, even when you only run the base card. Why else would a high level player have their shit locked behind a 0 skill lock, if not to ensnare this plucky water burglar?
---
And I just tested inspirational solo on a public team on super mutant lvl 75 vs non solo on a public team on same level super mutant : it doesn't work solo on a public team. Stop sharing false information when you don't know for sure.
---
&gt; Have you got anything good so far?
---
Nothing good so far.
---
For the silos? Yeah
---
nice!
---
Meanwhile in LMG land
---
Is this todd howard?
---
I like this, I don't mind.
---
Thanks mate that'll make my life easier 👍
---
So how does it work? Do you become drunk enough that your not scared but not too drunk where you start blacking out?
---
thanks for testing. seems like i got more than one memorized wrong....
---
Once per day, per character. So if you want to farm them, you'll need more characters 50 or higher.
---
rare reward is only one per day
---
Nah it's one of the best perks against boss mobs and anything with a good chunk of armor 
---
Plus it's one of the few perks that's still calculated multiplicatively
---
I tried swapping it out and it's hard to match the kill time of enemy mobs with any perk combos that don't include it 
---
It was never bad either, just not anything special, plus the debuff applies to everyone in the group I think? So that's a big boost in dps for a party 
---
I'm not exactly sure if it works for everyone or not though, haven't had a chance to test, so I usually share it for Earl runs just to be safe
---
I'll swap over to Blocker in case people are dropping like flies tho
---
Mine as well... hahahahaha it was literally the first thing I checked after the update
---
Tenderizer is one of the strongest damage perk post patch 22...
---
Always rad sponge. Bloodies favorite perk :D
---
You can also play the waiting game, Bethesda has publicly announced they realize how some players have been having a more difficult time. So they’re planning on performing a hot fix in the coming weeks to recalculate enemy difficulty to make it a bit easier for players level 30-60ish who haven’t had time to get gear that can handle the tougher enemies
---
I'm a Junkie build and my JE and Jffr Handmades do more damage than the AA varients. Unsure about TSE but Junkies is doing 20% more damage than AA.
---
;) sadly it doesn't work
---
Junkies wasn't hit hard trust me. I'll post a video later today if you want, it's behind bloodied but way in front of AA, not sure about TSE, but as I said Junkies was not hit hard, and I don't use any magic weapons.
---
I HATE farming flux and stabilizing agents in nuke zones, so I was reluctant to switch any of my weapons over to Ultracite receivers. Daily Ops solved that issue.
---
It's not lazy when i am doing uplink and need to stand near the objective. I don't want as many bodies piling up out of reach. 
---
Also being on the map the entire mission since i didn't see it to clean it up.
---
I appreciate the offer. My play style of "charging in, guns blazing" is still working for me.
---
Same here lol. 👍😁
---
*Laughs in original Xbox One*
---
These ops are driving me mad for this reason. I’ve done most of them on my own. Now and then you find maybe one other person who joins you each time you go in. I had a group of us last night but because 2 of them kept getting lost or didn’t bother joining us to kill all the blood eagles instead or they run out of the area for ammo which drives me nuts coz u can pick all the ammo up at the end. Know one seems to understand they need to stay in the area or get to booster to booster quickly, u don’t even shoot when goin from one to the other until u have boosted the signal
---
NEVER use that option, it's for suckers.  All it's doing is logging you out and then immediately logging you back in.  If a world just opened up or the world you were in fills up in the split second you were gone then you're fine, but otherwise  you're more than likely heading right back where you were.  Always leave manually, wait a few seconds and then log back in.
---
Well why not have [a few minutes of unbridled hacked weapon display?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QtH-l9_o6f8) This should be adequate to prove my point. A credible big YouTuber had these weapons.
---
What lvl are you?
---
With the extra weekly challenges they added, the weight of the total score available shifted to be much more casual friendly. They also seemed to have toned down some of the daily tasks to make them a little less "chore-ey". Already this season feels much less grindy than the first one did. I'm glad they took some of our feedback and suggestions into consideration.
---
I'll try it...thanks.
---
This happened to me tonight but I had (and always have) pacifist ON. So....off with that card.
---
I am also looking for plans on ps4. How much?
---
I also have dodgy in agility and it’s brilliant for saving my life
---
If your interested and don’t mind having a woman join your team invite me or join me. GT is FemaleFury79
---
Just tested it on lvl 75 super mutant, non stealth, in torso : without it's 5 shots to kill, with it's 3 shots with my build....
---
Al's tattoo parlour and roof
---
Dumb question but are you playing borderless or fullscreen mode 
---
I'm on a 1070 and ive never had it as bad as 30fps, but performance does improve a lot for me when it's in full screen 
---
Which is annoying because it does NOT like it when you tab out while in full screen on a multi monitor setup :/
---
Other than that, I could be wrong but I think the game is more cpu intensive than gpu. I always notice my processor is always working much harder than my graphics card.
---
Have you tried playing while your task manager is open? That could be a good start, as it could also be your ram or harddrive that's having trouble for some reason
---
And it would be easy to tell where the problem is, due to something being maxed out on performance, at least hopefully it will be obvious when you check anyway
---
Well as a legacy wielder I'd like a challenge.
---
Honestly even in full health everything is being obliterated.
---
Cheers mate, appreciate the reply. 🍻👍
---
Have a fiddle with the finer settings like view distance etc. If I can get a constant 144fps with a 2060 at 2k, you can definitely get it on a 2080.
---
Also,  make sure it's full screen and not borderless.  Borderless was running at sub 60fps for me.
---
Two people have said this now so deffo gonna see if that solves it. Kind of makes logical sense to a degree too, as the game now 'knows' you have been updated on the board and score.
---
Good post. I dont have 100% perfect gear. But I'm close enough and not having issue. I've not played my lower levels yet.
---
And Dodgy, Dodgy really really helps
---
I guarantee this post was 100% for funsies. I'm actually having fun with the game rn.
---
Can confirm it does not. I always run with pacifist on and someone was able to kill me tonight. I did have a workshop at the time, but wasn't near it...(had Bogtown, was killed at Whitespring)
---
For me, ammo factory is a must have, I'm now swimming in ultracite .50
---
It doesn't appear the server actually handles any rag doll physics for the corpses. It seems all of this is handled individually by the client. You'll notice if you move a corpse around with explosions or something, fast travel away and travel back, the body will have returned to its original position. If you goo-ify or ash pile an enemy, the pile spawns in where the enemy died but not where the visual effect of the corpse landing ended up.
---
That's great to hear.
---
Because the game wasn't designed to do so at a base level.  The game wasn't even designed to check if your spot was taken in the first place since in the beginning if your spot was taken your camp just got removed and stored as blueprints.
---
Also because it is more likely to cause problems than anything.  What you're asking for would essentially lock people out of worlds based purely on where their camp had been placed, for you that might be fine but other people might want to join certain worlds with a friend or someone they're trading with or anything like that and if the game were to check for their camp and then not let them log into those worlds it would be a problem.
---
if i got a award, i would give that to you. thanks for the  comprehension
---
Do stealth perks help much on a commando build? I feel like very little of your damage output will be able to capitalize on that
---
At least that's how it seems to go for me lol
---
The enemies are now levelled to your level. There is no easier area and harder area. All of mine are around 75-100 which was a shock as I live in the forest.
---
Yup. I started with 4000 5mm and ended with 12000 5mm yesterday lol
---
if we assume that all weapons have reduced damage, then Yes, it has become more difficult
---
What was today's? I didn't get to play it
---
It’s been a wild ride
---
Didn't it do that in F4? Or maybe it was F3. Either way yes we need that!! I hate the spin up time when small enemies get close
---
Sounds good to have an actual challenge now. Maybe it's time for a comeback.
---
I’ve been playing since launch. I remember when they added the event, I’ve done everything correctly.
---
Stealth can add x2.5 to x3.75 times damage lol
---
Just tested tenderizer with follow through and taking one for the team max ranked both : it works for me as intended...
---
Either what’s already been stated, or go around player vendors. Got most of my main weapons from them.
---
Bear in mind that the people that have given up on the game have probably already moved on.
---
Sure there are some that haven't but asking people to stop criticising the game isn't really gonna work.
---
If there's an issue with toxicity then I'd agree that definitely needs to be stop.
---
Daily ops teams (in my experience) actually do the daily ops
---
Yo thanks for testing
---
Hey /u/TrueDraconis 
---
Get Tenderized lmao
---
Good, yes
---
U can play it on Xbox game pass for pc with a month for 1$
---
so what... you stop by biv and he randomly  asks if you happened to find the vocal sack of a giant monster so he can turn it into booze?  that makes just as much sense as having it randomly fall into your inventory after you do the brotherhood a favor.
---
I have a TSE90 tesla which is great, does comparable damage or even higher damage than my TSE90 laser, with much higher durability, the accuracy is slightly lower though, and visually the split laser rifle explosions look awesome with the burning effect.
---
If they were cool they would
---
You have knowledge of the game like others don't.
---
That why non-issue.
---
But I'm glad you are able to give feedback to those that are having a hard time. The thing is as well for many is that they do not have enough Perks to trade for the new legendary and or much less move them around. You and I know takes time to gather those perk points (ugghh).. the implementation of scale was a bit heavier than expected. I don't understand why they didn't made adjustment or maybe they didn't know it was going to be this impactful to players that didn't run specific build?
---
Yeah but for how many shots/enemies tho
---
On rifleman I understand stealth would be great, but I didn't know it could go well with a full auto weapon since their shot to shot damage is much lower
---
My ex wife’s
---
It's (in my opinion) super fun. Less bugs. There are still bugs but not alot majorly game breaking. It's pretty big space tho since two of its biggest updates have been released. Tonnes of new weapons and armours. New enemies and loads of ways to play the game. And if you are below lvl 50. All enemies are now scaled down to your lvl for balance. Honestly I think it's up to you but if you wanna play it. Than remember to enjoy yourself.
---
In level 124 im running a unarmed mele build focused around the unstoppable monster and have like half ss unyielding armore and I need 2 hits to kill most things. It's not bad it whas needed
---
Is it an perma ban or not? I'm not fussed on the debate if they should or shouldn't be allowed but I just want to know if it's a perma ban, there are some awesome puzzle bases out there that's for sure though.
---
pls take me out of latin america
---
Ya they all have armor you need to equip tank killer which will ignore armor for them 
---
But like said splash damage is minimal 20% and of 36 thats like 7 and enemies with armor will reduce it even more
---
If using Sympto-matic makes your camps penis bigger for more than four hours please consult your Sympto-matic.
---
So true! Been much easier this time around.
---
When I went to get one finally I jumped on the roof of the camp of someone in my team, looking in their window at them, and scared the shit out of them when they saw me revving up
---
Also bring back legendary Rippers so I can wield a Ripper in one hand and a gauss pistol on the other while wearing PA.
---
For, uh, reasons.
---
Ah yeah I've never tried Dodgy. I'll have to at least give it a go, cheers!
---
What settings are you running exactly?  If it’s not to much a bother
---
I'm what it can be called an average player: since i always played the previous Fallout games without thinking about build and stuff, i am doing the same on FO76 too. With this update i realized that my way of playing this game is completely wrong. I'm currently level 85, i don't have any decent weapon, every time i bought some legendaries with scrip i always get shitty weapon and so i'm struggling a lot in everything i do now. Every enemy could kill me and i use more ammo that i can get. I think i just should take some time to learn to play this game properly, making good build, but yes, don't be so dismissive.
---
I’m on full screen, I’ll see what task Maher says
---
/u/jasonking00 : I tested with and without tenderizer on super mutant, tenderizer works as intented with max Follow through, so what do you mean ?
---
Yeah you can *join in* on this one, rather than dedicate your whole play session to it. I'm loving it!
---
Bro you made my mouth water
---
On a side note, can anyone tell me if it cures diseases? I have a base by the water and fast traveling to it gives me and my guests parasites. Hoping to cure it for visitors since I can’t set where they spawn.
---
Alright listen man, I will bitch if I want. Especially if it's fucking crouch zoom sensitivity that has been around since the inception of the game. Crouch zoom sensitivity and power armor discrepancies are literally an IN YOUR FACE issue, and has not been fixed since 2018.
---
All you have to do is go in 3rd person and try to aim while crouching and standing and you'll see how obvious it is. Why not fix it? It's an easy ass fuckin fix like holy shit lol.
---
It's shitty fucking ethic when they ignore easy to fix shit that is literally in your face. It's not anything convoluted like server disconnect issues. Some dumbass fucked up on the math, and all they need to do is fix that line.
---
.308 too. My LMG needs more food.
---
depends, if you want to nerf my mobs bc ur shit then don't
---
Trust me it's actually easier this time. I'm casual as anything, on L17 now and ticked them all of just playing normally.
---
Stealth is even better on commando builds.
---
Daily ops, Uranium Fever,  Horde Events. Although I have noticed quite a few more legendaries with patch 22 while roaming the world,  that might be lucky RNG rolls though.
---
I actually had this happen last year though I don't recall from what.  Couldn't I was so confused when I got a whole bunch of jump suits in a single reward.
---
You should be able to sacrifice aim or blocking to dual wield and deal damage
---
The chances to get something better than that without using the market/trading are kinda low...
---
Riding shotgun, violent night, guided meditation spawn multiple legendaries quite often and can be done solo if needed... 
---
West Tek very rarely has zero legendaries and it's nice exp too.
---
Overall it's probably faster to do the daily ops, you get 1/2 legendaries and if you get some good reward (like the suit) you can probably trade it for a better weapon in a matter of minutes.
---
Thanks for everyone’s feedback, I switched some perk cards, slapped on some mods and this Fixer is a lot fun 🤙🏼
---
My gpu is at 49% and my cpu ( ryzen 2600) is at 49%, could this be the issue, (I do plan on getting an i7 8700k soon)
---
I see the extra damage multiplier for sure. For example I seem to down the entire West Tek courtyard in a matter of seconds with Gun Fu and sneaking (and jumping whilst crouched to get the guys way further back). The range on my Handmade seems illegal almost!
---
Where is she located? 🤣
---
bitch all you want but don't nerf the mobs bc people don't even play the game with 1 brain cell
---
I honestly would never have expected that lol but neat
---
As someone that was in this op, I can also say that it doesn’t always show for the other people; al I saw were the normal random legendaries that appeared in my inventory as normal.
---
I'm not saying things will get loud now,
---
But THINGS WILL GET VERY LOUD NOW.
---
My nightmares 🥺
---
Hey better than starting a team as the other was full, getting one member and he jumps into ops, then I follow then after a min he leaves. 
---
My first op, I'm lvl 56 or so, other guy 200 plus. 
---
I struggled through it, way over time, and that guy is kinda rude, if he stayed it would have been much easier but I finished it anyway.
---
That doesn't sound to good, want a hug brother?
---
i endure all ur bitching since beta
---
but don't fking nerf the mobs bc you are so casual that can't even deal damage to mobs.
---
Haven't seen you tube channel catering to those that don't want to be like GOD
---
He's shopping for early Christmas gifts leave him alone
---
For the first few hundred hours in the game I ran a Bloodied Rifleman build but have never gone back since going Bloodied Commando. SO much more DPS for both a boss battle or clearing mobs.
---
Nah, I want my Whiskey
---
I punch things
---
Ahh whiskey, good choice sir. I'll drink to that once I get over this current hangover.
---
Thanks, I didn't try looking the socials tab! I'll have a go tonight.  :)
---
Hmm maybe not, doesn't seem immediately off
---
Uhhhhh my only other idea is have you tried opening up the Nvidia GeForce thing and going to your games and using the game optimization from there? Just to see if maybe some weird setting is causing the performance loss?
---
If it performs well after doing that, you can start tweaking settings til you get the quality you want 
---
Or maybe you need a new graphics driver installation? I do video editing and push my gpu really hard, and some times it starts acting weird til I reinstall or update the drivers
---
🔫
---
Sheesh. I have a lot to learn. Thank you
---
I'm not set up for melee up use a fss bone hammer and have no problems unless it's super mutants
---
Yes. Someone finally said what I've been feeling. I'm level 440 unarmed junkie and it no longer sparks joy. I can kill stuff, eventually, sure - but I'm not good anymore. I'm not useful.
---
Oh, I didn't try looking the socials tab! I forget that's there, haha. Thanks for the tip!
---
lol good point. Never thought about it.
---
Time to really get rid of these Stims
---
Yeah it did in fo4, ridiculous that it doesn't anymore.
---
Fun, whats blocker do? I didnt check, i was going to try and add into enurance for tanky perks
---
I mean I could do it if they're jumping sliders and non-hostile. Thems cute. 
---
But spider enemies in games can Frick Of
---
Yeah, rifleman has decent ammo conservation though, can't beat that sometimes haha
---
Depends on the playstyle, but yeah running around guns blazing is a lot of fun
---
downvote this, too... lol ask me to explain like you're 5
---
They were the first to complain it was to easy. I'm bored. I can shoot God and Jesus in heaven and the devil in hell with my Tesla rifle and one shot them at the same time! no fun.etc. 
---
Because I am Meta-God
---
How rich and unoriginal.
---
They sit there and say we complain?
---
Btw Level 210 stealth,commando mutation, shotgun, Solar armour. I have no issues what so ever defending myself in this new One wasted...I'm playing with a Level 41 and his not having a great time right now...
---
I’ve just gone into the GeForce thing and it says that hame is running in 4k
---
Ticks are way worse than spiders. Spiders don't want to be around you, and they certainly don't want your blood, nor will they give you Lyme disease, or perform sneak attacks when you just want to walk in the woods
---
AND SPIDERS WON'T GET THEIR HEAD RIPPED OFF WHEN ITS DEEP IN YOUR LEG MEAT, LEAVING A HORRIBLE LITTLE DISEMBODIED NIGHTMARE HEAD EMBEDDED IN YOUR SKIN, NEEDING TO BE DUG OUT LEST IT CAUSE AN INFECTION
---
fuckin hate ticks, brah
---
You have a chance of a rare plan per tier completed. Once completed, you have to wait for the Daily Ops to reset to try again.
---
I swear I recall that username and was at your camp recently. 
---
Lol...I wonder how many here are people I've been on the same servers with there?
---
Also to add on i thought i might incoporate grim reapers sprint into my own build, i was going to give up food]/water carrying for the survival stims myself.
---
But in game it’s still 1080p
---
Well he gives all the other recepies like that, so yeah why not?
---
Haven’t you ever seen that film ‘wanted’ , that’s how. 😂
---
What the hell are you doing that warranted blowing through 3000 rounds for a single op?
---
I have a Bloodied 50 cal and i get more ammo out of every OP. I went from 100 ammo to 4000 ammo.
---
Are you aiming for the head? Are you tapping shots, or are you just spraying and praying?
---
Only thing I'd like is if the ammo automatically gets picked up instead of having to loot. Sometimes I feel like an asshole spending time to loot ammo after the match and players can't start the OPS until everyone leaves.
---
If you like base building survival-ish games yas
---
It's got probably the biggest selection in interior decorating I've seen in a game that featured base building 
---
If anyone knows any games with as much variety pls dm me haha
---
The downside is you also have to fight the weird and convoluted limitations that the actual base building part will try and put onto you, but it can be conquered! ...most of the time lol
---
Uh yeah that would be a huge tank to performance then lol
---
Yeah build your perks around the type of weapons you want to use and you'll notice the difference. For me, I will use shotgun mostly, so I have a lot of points put into strength, and all the shotgun perks loaded. If I try to use another type of weapon are really notice the difference! 
---
Also make sure you've modded your weapons up to their best ability... scrap all the weapons that you find so that you can learn new mods, and if you grow corn, tatoes and mutfruit and have some purified water you can make vege starch and will never run out of excess adhesive. 
---
Also I recommend using VATS a lot, I'm not really sure if the top players use it but for me it's a lifesaver.  So a lot of my perks also increase my crits and VATS performance.  I'm level 63, casual player usually solo, so I feel your pain! 😁
---
That's not true.. I haven't seen a very big change in my damage. And I run quad 25%ffr assault rifle.
---
Full set of unyielding armor, radicool and the chemist backpack, i always have around 44-49 STR.
---
Glitch?
---
Since the update dropped, im mostly working on my mains bloodied build. Hes around lvl 500 so i had some perk points to use. Im running the poison resistance one lvl3, END/INT lvl3, AGI lvl4, LUK lvl2 and Taking one for the team lvl3.
---
I managed to almost bring up the dmg to what it was before. But the biggest upgrade is his durability now. Even at 20% health hes more durable than before. Still only works well with top notch gear. My second bloodied char will probably have to change to a full health build.
---
What do you swap Mister Sandman perk with during day/indoors? I'd also drop Ground Pounder for 3 ranks of Concentrated Fire.
---
You’d think but after changing it 1080p the FPS has gone up by like 10
---
I was getting \~32 fps until I configured windows to use 144Hz on my monitor and use fullscreen mode (not borderless/window). Setting the refresh rate in either Nvidia control panel or windows display settings was key for me.
---
Still caps around 72 fps. When I turn vsync off I can get higher fps, I get a bug where I suddenly can't walk around unless I mash a few keys at the right times. Definitely happens when I disable vysnc. YMMV.
---
I see people in **$$**InDailyOps. And I can't think anything but Payday with the dollars, we gonna steal some moneeeeeeeey in that daily op!
---
Rethink your thread titles
---
*pervert*
---
Are you absolutely sure It's 1080p in-game? Because full screen will shrink the 4k resolution down to fit, but it will still be rendering everything in 4k which will cause performance loss
---
I mean you can play it like a normal Fallout game. But in  a normal Fallout game you have to spec for combat, at least to a certain degree. Yes, in other fallout games you could use speech skills to avoid fights- ***with humans*** that is.  But I don't remember being able to persuade a rad scorpion or a death claw to behave and be nice.  Those are enemies that were always aggressive and always had to be fought and if you didn't have a build then you got wrecked.
---
That could be true, but we will never know for sure... :)
---
You gotta pump up those numbers!
---
Before and after.. little tougher with 22, but I stack medic pump and born survivor so I dont die at all... if you really want a yawn,  throw on "Electric Absorbtion" and assaultrons turn into fluffly little clouds
---
It has gotten a lot better. 
---
\- The dmg bug with fast firing weapons, as well as other things like disappearing items was fixed, and with one wasteland, weapons got a overhaul to make a little less dmg now, but that was to make it balanced for people "abusing" the system
---
\- There are NPC now, more events and quests
---
\- New hard content like ACP or the Daily ops to get new rewards
---
\- Tons of new camp items if you re into building your perfect base
---
\- the last balance changes makes it easier to get legendaries, as well as more chances to get some (Daily ops, ACP or SBQ World events, more encounters) since everything now scales and drops tailored to your level
---
\- overall tedious things like ammo crafting was made easier by having some support (mainly the new legendary perk cards and daily ops dropping ammo that you use)
---
\- and last but not least: Seasons; You can complete fairly easy daily and weekly challenges to earn stuff for free (think of it like a battle pass that you get for free)
---
I pvp in this game most days and I've never once seen what you are describing.
---
Please show a video of someone in pacifist mode proccing pvp vs someone else outside of a workshop and without a bounty.
---
No, its my precious treasure, when it becomes a new currency, im ready!
---
Those screenrant builds are terrible though right?  More than a year old and at least at a glance many of them have terrible build synergy in today’s game.
---
Well that's progress at least haha
---
Maybe you have to disable V-Sync using your .ini file? I've never tried to run the game above 60 fps cuz I record gameplay footage at 60fps and locking the framerate makes the footage look smoother
---
Shotgun + Enforcer + Headshot
---
The assaultron holy trinity
---
Tenderizer doesnt cancel Follow Through, but Suppressor does.
---
I fear Follow Through stops Tenderizer but I'm not sure.
---
no.  this is not happening.  sorry, but you are incorrect.  double check your pacifist setting.
---
If it's happening to you, you are the one and only player with this issue.  submit a bug report.  but no video proof = you are just spouting nonsense.  Please prove me wrong.
---
&gt; What the hell are you doing that warranted blowing through 3000 rounds for a single op
---
I routinely use upwards of 1000 .50 during daily OPs.
---
Not everyone uses overpowered meta builds.
---
The masks are possible rewards from enclave events , or using gold you can buy the plan for vault mask (flower covered forest scout mask) from regs at vault 79

🤣 i preferred it the way it was, i liked the exploration but now stuffs to dangerous and fallouts engine doesn't exactly provide smooth mechanics or a smooth shooting experience. Before anyone starts with the git gud comments i play warzone etc regularly and get my ass kicked but 9/10 its my fault, fallouts mechanics are "wonky" at best and having several enemies rush you at once which are now all bullet sponges feels like a cheap way to increase the difficulty.
---
Somehow my Radaway stash is stable...
---
Thank you thank you.
---
Actually I think Arktos would make a fun, if comparably small, DO map, now that you mention it
---
Removing the need to maintain your hunger and thirst would negate a large part of the 'Survival Aspect' of the game. I doubt they will remove it.
---
Remember the days when 76 was the number of points standing between the game and a 100% score
---
Okay, i'll raise ya one more. Instead of dual pistols, have a pistol in main hand, and a one-handed weapon in the offhand.
---
The main problem is suppressor, it prevents follow through from working.
---
I believe Follow Through on the other hand, stops tenderizer to work but I dont know how I should test this. How did you test it?
---
Yes but at level 1 the level 1 enemies where not this hard, in fact i was actually killing enemies 10 levels ahead of me before the update now i struggle with my level.
---
You're welcome , now that you know what events to do for the masks go and have ... A real blast 😉
---
Ahhh thanks for the info! I'm actually on PC, but I appreciate the offer.
---
I did this earlier and got a slight boost, I building I get over 100 which is nice, and shows it’s not capped
---
I planned to use Follow Through+Suppressor´+Tenderizer to counter the bloodied nerf. If they would work together, it would be a pretty strong setup against bosses. 
---
But for some reason, they dont seem to work together.
---
&gt; They were the first to complain it was to easy.
---
They don't get to complain. They did that to themselves.
---
Yeah the Pioneer Scout dress does it too...... I switched to shorts on my chick toon as it felt inappropriate.... :S
---
It says 1080p in game, I don’t know here else to check haha
---
Wallace left a note on the table telling you where he's gone.
---
I just make my own, throw out a few team invites to the highest lvls i see, and wait for it to fill, once full i head in and run it.
---
Blocker remover 45% of incoming melee damage, turns ghouls into pussies. Most things tbh.
---
I’m wondering if they are joining to take advantage of their perks/mutations are there any other empty teams?
---
I alway join in an op if someone in an ops team starts one, either that or I would be in an intelligent or event bonus team.
---
I mean all my perks are in shotguns for kneecapper build so one could say I also am not set up for melee
---
But punch regardless
---
Thank you, they thought honestly think all the community want to play their game their style,build,etc. Haven't seen anything about this blow back in any bit of news...all of these channels buring these facts. Not just build. Everything got affected. CAMP building has to be reduced for necessary upgrade defense. Not acknowledgement to the camp build community only their character build. drowning out the rest when they pulled out their pom-poms to say it has no effect. What so ever I don't know what ppl are complaining about  It's the greatest patch ever.etc.. if your not dedicated to other players just to one section. Don't use your influence to change everyone game play to how you wanted it to be.
---
If you twerk, tweeked, pour over schematics. Math , algorithms, chems,perks,foods that are  not supposed to be used in said combos go out kill EARLE in second's??? but yet you  discovered it... could that be called EXPLOITATION. bethesda response make it harder...  They don't dare take it down a notch because that is to beneath them!
---
But yet again BETHESDA LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY! I wonder which one?🤔🤔🤔
---
Your not the only one who plays this. 
---
Not everyone want to be like You!!
---
And I keep hearing the same names You tubers being praised for these influence.
---
Illusion of fun you have
---
 1 daily ops
---
Same daily
---
Same Event
---
Hell everything is the same!!!!!
---
I don't understand their definition of fun?  Get to press the button twice instead of once?
---
It's harder!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
They should allow us to scrap ammo instead of using that ammo converting device that takes ages
---
There are "magic" weapons  (with weird effect combinations), and legacy Weapon (old OP legendary combo), in the game, yes.
---
But, hacked Weapon like you name them would require that the server actually sees them, and use their stats. It's not possible.
---
Interestingly, that dude in the video , when he use his weapons, do the classic damage of legacy or magic weapon, (which should be patched for sure). and Melee is standard damage pre nerf.
---
But when he shows supposedly "hacked weapon" he don't use them. I wonder why ;)
---
Maybe it's because you can change the skin of a weapon by editing the mesh for yourself, but you can't adjust the damage for real.
---
Punch all the salads
---
I’m always running this perk I’m always so disappointing when I see someone sharing it even though it’s one of the most useful cards if you can only share one point.
---
With Blocker you take 45% less damage from melee attacks. I try not to get too close but sometimes I get rushed and it does help.
---
I second this. I believe you are guaranteed a legendary for completing it each time. As long as the op isn't something annoying like the day 1 resilient mutation, then it should be pretty easy to just slaughter everything. Get a good team, and you can knock it out in under 8 minutes and for elder(as a reminder, it only gives extra rewards for the first time reaching the rank for that op/day).
---
Easy breezy beautiful
---
My nuts
---
Rewards cool? You can finish how ever you want. Your game your money. Good for you. I got a wait myself I'm broke 🤣🤣🤣
---
There’s been a damage nerf too
---
Strange in numbers, inspirational, revenant, four leaf clover, adrenaline, action boy/girl, enforcer, friendly fire, bandolier/batteries included, nerd rage and tenderizer are all good cards to share. 
---
Anything that's utility, survival or healing based is pretty solid. I think they're the cards most of the team could get use out of one way or another.
---
High settings, ultra textures, high water, high lighting,  ultra shadows, high shadow distance.
---
Depth of field and FoV are at about 1/4 of the bar. 
---
That does the trick for me. Results may vary due to silicon lottery/other system bottlebnecks.
---
The problem is that enemies are so tanky that high alpha strike weapons are useless compared to high dps weapons.
---
High dps weapons are commando and heavy weapons, exactly the two weapon classes least affected by the changes in one wasteland.
---
Alpha strike weapons absolutely *need* to be able to one-shot most enemies with the correct perks and a little bit of aim.
---
Personally, I'd suggest adding weakspot bonus damage multiplier to the tank-killer perk. This also gives some love to gunslingers, a class sorely in need of some help right now.
---
The Survival Shortcut legendary perk practically does this.
---
To be honest I am so lazy to swap out any cards as I hate getting past the choose a perk/move a point screen all the time. I just leave it on (you got me thinking though. I might take it off as I really don't need more damage at all). I've always run 3 ranks of concentrated fire until today. I've been testing just 1 star today and I can't feel the difference at all between 1 rank and 3 ranks but I can feel slightly faster reload speed (I miss the fireworks ultra fast reload bug so much lol).
---
Silos? No no my friend we use this to snoop in the houses of people who lock their doors
---
I've definitely been seeing more. I'm about to start dropping my heavy scrip stuff lol
---
Hahahhhaahahaha why would you wanna do that?
---
If you try to perform a colonoscopy on your character sometimes they'll jump straight through a door
---
Furious takes 9 shots to ramp up to its maximum of +45% damage. Which means it's really quite good for anything that takes substantially more than those 9 shots to kill, and it's crap for anything that requires less than a dozen shots to kill.
---
Survival shortcut is as close as you will get to the removal in a sense.
---
I mean, nobody is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to grind. You current gear isn't going to get any weaker.
---
If you weren't at a workshop and not engaged in PvP then you have "take one for the team" active, AND pacifist inactive.
---
Activate pacifist and you are safe.
---
Not sure what you missed and how.... but it was something that was a decently talked about of one wasteland.  Not really the wholesale removal, but the debuffs at least.
---
Multiple times, from the devs, in multiple places.  I'd say third most talked about part past the level scaling and the change in damage math.
---
Which has me scratching my head on what i missed seeing as how no one seems to be talking about how the debuffs weren't removed...
---
I mean, you don't really have to min max to survive. You do need to commit to a certain combat style though and invest points accordingly. Honestly I can't remember any game like this where you didn't have to do that.  I don't really even consider myself a min maxer.  I did decide to go with a heavy weapons build early on, but I don't run bloodied or junkies, and I run a few carry weight perks.  I don't think committing to a particular combat style is min maxing.
---
Are you using magic weapon? If not, well done m8.
---
I went in with 98 rounds on my gauss rifle left with 488 all i use daily ops for is ammo at this point
---
Yeah, I can't see them removing a role-playing aspect from their RPG. What they could do is improve on the current system by including more bonuses you get from food and drinks. Even if they were minor bonuses.
---
Imagine a triple one on Christmas or something. Holy Molly 20 levels per day.
---
Oh, ok. I glanced over the patch notes and probably missed it. Still don't know what's happening, though.
---
I'm glad you mentioned Destiny 2. The Daily Ops missions in general feel like Heroic Adventures mixed with Lost Sectors. This is the sort of content I'd love to see more of in game. Sometimes I don't want to invest hours into gaming, I enjoy quick "pick up and play" stuff like this as well.
---
I usually hang in Casual teams and so far, every single time i went into daily ops at least 1 - 2 people joined in as well
---
You ever been wearing a dress when the front panel disappears entirely and it's like a reverse apron?
---
Anything with a skirt almost feels programmed to provide upskirt views--esp getting in and out of a bed. I doubt it's actively malicious, probably they test things out on male toons only (or not at all) and call it a day.
---
Oh shit I didn't even realize the fancy inherently had magic
---
Well there's even more reason for me to suffer outside of I wanting cool looking gun
---
Nah, i'm not talking the perk thing, rather how bethesda was talking up the removal of the debuffs.  It wasn't a one off, off the shoulder mention either.  Came up multiple times that one wasteland was removing the hinger and thirs debuffs, leaving only the buffs for keeping it filled.
---
It took me 40. You lucky dog :)
---
Over and over and over you chuds ignore the fact that it's not the high level players who are struggling, but the new ones and people below level fifty. I don't know how many goddamn times this has to be explained.
---
Probably just bought all the ranks with atoms.
---
Could benefit from getting A Realm Reborn'd
---
No gid gud toxic bs here. I just felt like some content was too easy and the way you slaughter those dangerous creatures like they are nothing was always annoying. You are right with the wonky mechanics etc. And tbh who does not get his ass kicked except the pros?
---
In fact I just remark that on supermutant lvl 75 tenderizer work cause it's quick, but I just tested with and without it on behemoth without other damage perk, and it seems not to work after follow through proc, so : IMO, tenderizer with stealth commando is not useful for mobs, but can be useful for heavy non stealth.
---
lol wasn't that yesterday's op
---
I will keep saying that normal activies like events, dailies, weeklies, ops... Should award directly 10-20 SCORE points to incentivize do them. Or at least an event repeteable challenge (5 events, 100 score), not just the XP repeteable one.
---
Laughs in level 75/100 Stingwing.
---
Got attacked once? Here is poison equal to half your hp-bar. Do I see you using a stimpack? Lets counter that with MORE POISON.
---
Oooh, thats the most fun about the ops.
---
I’m saying if you play it this way it’s an extremely beneficial way to gain supplies, and provided they play the way I specified, they’re helping more than they’re hurting, and I should have specified don’t expect to be revived or even care if you are because it’s irrelevant to overall progress and loot. But I mean yeah cry about it if you want I’m just trying to help out players in a similar position as me. Also it’s a PSA because it has information relevant to the topic, information that I learned the hard way and would have liked to know sooner without suffering for it. Also I literally say sit on the objective and help if you can, which literally helps complete the objective. Idk what to tell you man low level players deserve their chance at score as well and all I’m trying to do is make it easier for them to do so while making it simultaneously less of a pain in the ass for high level players like yourself.
---
The same reason I used the PA clip to get into the gold reserves part of Vault 79 or whichever it is
---
*Adventure*
---
Do you have any mutations on? There were speculations back about a year ago or so that the mutations or Starched Genes were preventing from certain disease to count towards that Challenge. I never tested it myself, as I didn't have that issue with any of my characters.
---
You thought Bethesda was just ruthlessly deleting your camp from existence every time you got put into a server in which it couldn't be placed?
---
yep, forgot to upload it yesterday
---
That's there's just a shame.... If I'd bought my way to the end and found that the greenhouse was busted I'd be pissed.
---
Did not notice heating up
---
Oh geez, didn’t know it worked even with pacifist on
---
Haha I ended up 8:01 on that one. Was so annoyed
---
I honestly did, I thought you had to use the blueprint to put it back in the map, however every time I tried to use the blueprint it says this object is floating or whatever it says.
---
Colossal problem
---
"I didn't have an optimum build, I just had a Minigun shooting explosive fucking bullets."
---
Lol, what a joke.
---
Hahahahahaha please tell me how you do that!!!
---
very interesting. My theory is as follows: Tenderizer, Follow Through and Suppressor use the same slot. Only one can proc while Suppressor has the highest and Tenderizer the lowest chance to proc.
---
This leads to my next problem: What happens if we fight a boss, one player has Tenderizer, one Suppressor and one Follow Through? What happens if one player has Follow Through level 1 and another has it on max level?
---
I almost wished that I would have never invested into Follow Through, but now it's too late.
---
I... don't do bethesda patch notes lol.  I trust them about as far as i can throw the statue of liberty.  Hence why the asking 😛.  Also seeing as how i am most certainly still getting debuffs i wagered it was omitted wholesale.
---
Yep i had this happen last year too, didn't even notice till an hour later, had no clue how i got it all, many caps were made that day.
---
Looks like she needs a Nocturnal Rolling Pin.
---
You're totally right. But this sub is invested with arrogant, tweaker spreadsheet builds who just want a FPS, not a Fallout game.
---
I got it from uranium fever the other day
---
How would fixing some weapons lose players?
---
Does edgy mean smelly and scared of conversations irl?
---
It was fun today.
---
The problem is most of these high level spreadsheet build types don't give a shit about other players, especially new ones.
---
Same BOS outfit we got for Free by giving donation?
---
Yea couple days later pkup 2 of them. Wtf? Fort Defiance and. Camp venture... Don't trade your good stuff.
---
It's made it super easy to hit the daily limit and have vendors full of cheap 3 stars that's for sure.
---
Honestly i barely notice a damage difference at all, the enemies just have higher health ofc because they are higher lvl
---
Poland.
---
This. Otherwise Wendigo Cave, WS golf club and two possible spawns if you follow the road south from Abbie's bunker.
---
Im very cautious about NW. All of my pvp experiences in adventure mode have been against hackers who blast me in one shot. Is NW similar?
---
I sometimes get 4 or 5 at the wayward
---
Because the other recipes are just approximations of pre war drinks and make sense as something a booze robot would be programed to know or develop... And this recipe is a little different with the active ingredient being the torn out throat of a two story tall acid belching cannibal monstrosity.
---
*Doomslayer intensifies*
---
Yes, the base level that ia repeatable gives legendary items.
---
Okrzyki kolego, mają dobry.
---
Now that we are at it, can we get more options in feminine clothes? These dresses are getting old, i would like a couple more options, something nice, not a raider kind of thing
---
There are ways:   
---
\- A full unyielding set as bloodied is always welcome (needed)  
---
\- serendipity on level 3 and nerd rage was the normal way to go about things (dmg resist and chance to negate dmg)  
---
\- Cavalier and Sentinel allow you to reduce dmg if you re running or standing still (Legendary 3\* effect)  
---
\- since you run bloodied, you can think about scaly skin and healing factor as mutations (more armor/-50ap and health regen/-chem effects 55%
---
Shit of course, making an alcoholic Junkie build so this is good to know haha. Cheers🍻
---
Look it up, theres a million vids
---
I’m level 322. I came to the game a few months late to the party, but I’ve been playing since January 2019. I remember struggling at level 38. I remember having crappy weapons and crappy gear  and not knowing how to spec properly. You know what I did? I played through it. Over time, I learned the ins and outs of the game. Sure, I picked up a few pointers from a player or two in-game along the way, but I grinded it out and eventually learned what I needed to know to not only survive the Appalachian Wasteland, but thrive. 
---
One Wasteland hasn’t changed that to any significant extent. The idea that low-level players are complaining because they have crappy gear and they can’t get all the best stuff right away just sounds all kinds of silly. This is the nature of EVERY game involving leveling up a character.
---
Joined an Ops Team. No ops going. Starting ops. Waiting and waving 3 minutes for other to come in.... Leaving server and repeat the loop. 
---
The servers are allready not very populated and without a searching for team and forced join option it is very hard to start as a team sometimes. in the near future in about 1-2 month we are forced to find groups and communitys to play ops in teams.- 
---
Ops should have a regionwide search function and as soon 4 players found it should start. After the ops there should be an option to repeat or leave. 
---
Second option would be that players that are in the opts team get kicked after not playing ops for about 5 minutes. That way there would be players that play ops and not just idle in said groups.
---
Lesson learned I guess, don't just assume the worst, seek out knowledge and solutions when things seem bad. That goes for everything not just games.
---
My Polish isn't that good, przepraszam.
---
Wow.what a disgrace of player he is. Disgusted.
---
If your on Xbox let me know times and such for the daily ops that u going to be at.
---
Tip. Start your own group..
---
If ur on xbox i can just give you one tomorrow
---
Only the sexually transmitted variant counts towards the achievement, you’ll have to find a willing snallygaster.
---
3k? Bruh what build do you have lmfao 💀 😂
---
Just saw a post about 8:00 on the dot, he barely beat you
---
Okay so I had never done it before (I’m level 29 and I joined a public team to see what it was like) and this guy, level 248, got it done in 7 minutes and 27 seconds and my dumbass was just following behind him while he’s wearing this huge power armor suit and carrying a mini gun. I had a level 15 gun and I just thought I was doing amazing work. But props to that team leader. Thank you so much for carrying my sorry ass through that daily OP AND a scorch beast queen. I own you forever.
---
They don't stack. Why don't you give them to low levels, they are having a really hard time since the update, they would appreciate it I think.
---
But we all started out that way. That’s just the nature of gaming. LOL
---
Looks good. I prefer another 3 in Endurance to have Fireproof.  I like to hunt scorched beast.  I also like 3 in GunFu.
---
I have several mutations and starched genes is hit or miss on me. Depends on whether or not I remember to take it back off after using RadAway. Lol
---
What fixer is it?
---
That’s sick, not quite that but I used a grafton monster to kill someone in nuclear winter today
---
My Google translate is excellent 🤣
---
LOL So far, the only snallies I’ve found just want to spit at me. Maybe it’s the purple hair. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Yea, besides the normal scrip/atoms/bullion..the card packs helped a lot for the legendary cards,
---
Ah yeah 100% I’ve tried Fireproof and it’s amazing for SBQ. I’ll try to get it in there via legendary perks for sure. Might take me a while though lol!
---
Yeah that’s BS, we’re supposed to be seeing raindrops hit the glass roof
---
That’s the max speed in power armor, you can try pocketing it and running outside of PA between the beacons. Also I don’t think they removed the damage reduction?
---
I just wish HP bloat wasn't a thing for enemies. DR sure, bloat away because higher level means better equiped.But enemies that aren't bosses need limits on their HP.
---
&gt;At the end of the day, Bethesda is a BUSINESS not a free start up indie game. They need to make money.
---
god that response is such a cop out. hello games is a business and yet they have made more than 10 major expansions to the game (one of which is coming out next week) all for free. digital extremes (warframe) is a business and yet every update/expansion they have made has been free. warframe also has microtransactions similar to fo76 and yet every bit of ingame content is available for free with no catch.
---
 you could make the argument that fo76 is an mmo similar to wow, eso or ff14 so the monthly pricetag is warranted. were fo76 a good game or can even pass as a legit mmo then maybe, but lets be honest this game does not deserve or warrant a monthly fee and doesnt deserve any more money.
---
these devs just made a shit product that killed their playerbase so they have to scrape the barrel somehow.
---
Coolest?  It's awfull Imo...  
---
Got my third 94 box today, sold the first 2999 and this one is going to 4999 and i'll keep on adding 2000 every time i get that crap and it sold...
---
No, but you can have a two shot, and use the uhh *cough* *cough* capacity glitch
---
But that’s the way it’s always been, tbh.
---
But using a marksman rifle level 25 against a level 25 feral ghoul enemy with sneak attack and headshot not killing the enemy is just plain not right. I dont have the rifleman perk cards etc but i never did and this is how i have been killing the enemies thus far. This update has ruined the game imo i cant see me playing much longer as it just plain and simple is not fun anymore.
---
I feel like this update has been made and focused around the level 100plus players with loads of perk cards and a targeted build. Meanwhile level 25 me with no specific build just trying to carry as much junk as possible is suffering.
---
Inanimate means stationary/doesn't move... ?
---
Played in since B.E.T.A. days and got back to it with Wastelanders;
---
I got better, most annoying bugs were fixed. There are still a few story breaking bugs that can hinder you completing the old and new main story, but I personally never encountered this problem.
---
The weapons are pretty versatile, but you need at least one good legendary roll on one (and some sense of build to really bring the dmg)
---
You now at least have a chance to get legendary weapons for your level, so no level 5 crap anymore if you re above 50; And there are more ways to get legendaries now
---
There are still plenty ways to exploit the dmg on your end (cough magic weapons cough)
---
It has the (imo) best base builder (at least in terms of mmo games)
---
It now tries bring new things with wastelanders/seasons/one wasteland (the change is there, and they try to make it better)
---
Good! Enjoy your new stuff!👍
---
Yeah, I’m super jealous of the blood eagle one. Man I would kill for that outfit.
---
I agree they made it hard for low levels, but you will get there eventually, and it will be possible to play lol
---
Or at least give well tuned the same time buff that rested did with Lover’s Embrace.
---
I'm grinding this daily ops. Best ammo farm so far. Sadly nobody joins my team. 😢
---
I’m level 57 and am just getting pummelled everywhere I go.  My ammo is being chewed through and I’m out of grenades as fast as I can craft them. 
---
I was having fun before. 
---
I’m straight up in Struggleville now.
---
DR doesn't show up on active effects and I have been feeling a tad sqishier since patch 22.
---
Squad Manuevers dude.
---
that or at least make the buff last a bit longer..
---
Yeah that would’ve been sweet
---
Join a team and use Squad Maneuvers in Charisma to get some more running speed. I believe it's 10% at rank one.
---
“Short and sweet” *continues with 7 paragraphs*
---
This isn't possible without a complete overhaul of the engine or custom making male and female animations.
---
The dresses in fallout have no physics is why it happens.  They're static meshes, which means they are the same, no matter what.  They can be bent, twisted and etc, but certain points on the mesh will always be linked with certain points on the character mesh.
---
No part of meshes in the fallout engine are able to freely flow, the closest we get are like the playground swings that you can bump into, but irrc they're still static meshes thay just have basic collision.
---
Anyways, to get your naughty bits hidden naturally would require something like they have in fighting games, inverse kinetics i think is what it is called.  With that, there can be free flowing materials attached to static meshes with collision.  Tends to be resource intensive, but eliminates the need to animate everything.  You just need to set collision parameters and hit ''go''.
---
When a game using this system loads, you'll see stuff floating before it looks ''proper''.  This is cause the collision has to ''hit'' for it to look right.  So the hair, skirts, etc, will be set to load in a neutral or slightly raised position so that it could then fall and look right.
---
Anyways, be prepared to be an exhibitionist until the next game, if they add this kind of physics in the next game even.
---
Smart thinking. Gonna do the same on my materials mule, for he also has a bunch of materials.
---
if i dont get my chems...ill blow up you
---
I tried. No improvement over EP and Speed Demon. Also tried Dead man sprinting.
---
This! All of this! Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like a lot of people come into the game expecting all of this instant gratification. We all struggled at those levels as we stumbled our way through learning the nuances of the game. It’s just the nature of gaming.
---
Top players use VATS all the time, at least on the consoles.  I would guess that PC players would use VATS to find enemies and then switch to manual to finish the kill.  And VATS is magical in that it can shoot around corners and through walls....
---
lol, because then they would need a real anti-cheat code, not the shite they have now.
---
Spend some time in NW and you'll see things different.
---
Think of it as rain activated irrigation :P
---
It would be nice, but i do respect the fact that so many of the outfits are gender neutral.
---
Makes those devs that complain women are too hard to add into games are blowing it out their queef holes.  If bethesda can manage to have multiple genders and not muck up the vast majority of outfits... other companies can too.
---
One of my buddies said the other day that it plays more like a mobile game now. I don't have much experience with mobile games but it sounds about right.
---
Grind, buy, grind, buy.
---
Goto your ini files and change iPresentInterval=1 to iPresentInterval=0 and then use nivida control panel and lock your FPS to your refresh rate
---
Yeah like, I haven't played for several months. I came back after the big update, but all the core issues were still there, and I don't think it's even possible to fix them. Or at least, they're not willing to.
---
I started a new character a while back and it showed how much of a struggle it was. Having to learn all the plans again, walk around Appalachia rather than fast travel and having few caps to buy things.
---
Akimbo knives
---
I got the brotherhood ops gasmaks helmet and i love it
---
I thought I was just crazy the past couple of days, because some of the time I can see -some- pink cloudy bits, but they're so faint that they're completely unhelpful. Didn't do anything visually in Daily Ops today, so I assume berry mentats are OP there?  
---
I started running a Junkie's build a few weeks ago, and berry mentats are basically my character's blood. I started looting more often just to make starlight berries refresh faster.
---
I'll still use them for the int bonus because score, but I hope the visual change is an accident that will be reverted.
---
&gt; a mole miner that's as tall as us
---
How about a mole miner in deformed excavator power armour?
---
Picked up a bloody .50 HMG. Always out of ammo now.
---
The Guass Minigun, Shotgun, and pistol have built-in explosive effects.  Not sure why they didn't release a rifle version.   I'd love to have one as a sniper rifle.
---
Cool, yeah I'm on Xbox One and I find it really useful.  It's good to know that other people use it and I'm not just being a n00b,haha 😁
---
Dope that work with ammosmith or super duper?
---
It's ever more frustrating when you do decide to load into the world and realise that there is NOTHING THERE
---
It’s a shame cause this game has such potential yet they just keep trying to squeeze every dime they can out of it and make it worse in doing so
---
Every bit helps
---
They take position and become mobile security for our camps.
---
You mean like in Fallout 4, right?
---
Did you not see the .50 cal acting like it had a beam splitter? I sure did. I also the minigun with gamma rounds. The alien blaster doing that much damage isn’t possible either.
---
Yeah!
---
I would just play country roads on repeat personally. Never gets old.
---
I've been playing a stealth pistol build for a while, and with tank killer now applying to pistols, I'm definitely feeling the love. I one shot lv75 scorched and blood eagles consistently, and anything harder should be harder, even though my TTK mirelurk kings and queens seems faster now.
---
Also, is it just me, or is VATS working better?
---
Well it would be neat if they added it to fallout 76 too :D
---
And yet you get downvoted?
---
Communists detected!
---
Thanks!
---
If they did this I might be tempted to actually use a minigun over my 50 cal, I just hate spin ups that much
---
They only really need to make one animation, mirror it so that it's on the other side of the screen and have the pistols shoot at the same time
---
Why are some Redditers pro communism I may ask? Very strange.
---
Does the ammo factory perk stack with Ammosmith and Super Duper? Will I finally be able to craft enough ammo to use my FFR Gauss Minigun for more than just the occasional boss fight?
---
I can place one for you, im just jumping on now for an hour. Does it let you build reward items at other peoples camps? Ive not tried yet
---
Happened with my mate dragging beckett to acp, can imagine that was one hell of an experience for him
---
Humour and satire is now dead in the over serious constantly outraged west.
---
While it would be cool to Dual Wield or Sword and Board I'd say the Pip boy being on our left arm is the biggest obstacle. Would fatigue that arm quickly with a gun/melee weapon and wouldn't be able to hold a shield properly with it there.
---
You're welcome to snoop but there's nothing interesting behind my locked door.
---
I leave the crafting stuff and vendor in the unlocked section of my camp.
---
i am 90% sure the bonus from speed demon puts you at the max run speed bonus
---
You're very right about this. On slower servers you can actually see how dmg calc needs a second longer sometimes. Especially explosive weapons need a sec longer to actually do their full dmg per shot.
---
I haven’t actually used a 50 cal before... Is it a pretty good alternative to revving heavy weapons?
---
How do I nominate this for reddit comment of the century
---
pc
---
Its on PC too, its very annoying, dont understand why they did this.
---
Nope complete opposite
---
I think it's the best ballistic heavy weapon, the 308 mg is pretty great too but chews through ammo way faster
---
Upvote because this is true. Players on the PTS need to be trying everything. Avoiding one aspect because it's "happy fun Wasteland" means things like this get through. Many other bugs flooded this Reddit during the PTS period but never once did I see this bug mentioned haha
---
That would cause potential issues with becoming over-encumbered during a fight if you’re running over dead enemies accidentally...
---
Sorry I can't hear you over my rank 2 funky duds
---
If I ever get a decent 3 star legendary 50cal drop I’ll be sure to give it a try!
---
I definitely think Bethesda cares it's just it's probably super low on their priority list I mean they fixed a bunch of bugs and the game is so much better than the initial release, that being said they still have Alot of things to adjust on top of adding new content. And who knows maybe they will never address this ever until the entire comunity across xbox ps4 and PC complain about it.
---
This is there since Fallout 4, always hated it.
---
Same here. I got burned out doing the first run and I find the Daily Op too hard to be enjoyable in the second one so I've no chance of completing the board this time round. I just pick off the easy challenges and see what I come up with. I've not looked at the rewards so I'm not aiming for anything.
---
Thanks heaps for the offer mate but someone came through a few hours ago and hooked me up. Much appreciated! And FYI you can place in others camps if anyone else asks you for one
---
Not many places you can find wendigos en mass other than at colossal problem.
---
A few places like whitespring golf club sometimes has one, and sometimes you'll find a few harassing the robots outside whitesprings.
---
Even wendigo cave only has one or Two, the the place should be called mirelurk cave because there are more of them inside than the caves namesake lol.
---
Edit: you could nuke a few locations that a wendigo collosus could spawn( can't remember exact locations) and they also spawn normal wendigos to fight
---
If you complete Beckett's quest you get a really decent 3 star 50 cal for free, it's the one I'm currently using until I can find a furious or instigating one
---
Exactly! I almost quit the game back in the day because I couldn’t advance past Blackwater Mine because the Mole Miners were always level 68 and I was level 20. It took me finding out that it was because high level players had been in the area and this raised the difficulty. Hopping servers was a pain in the ***, and it should not have been a necessary solution, but once I learned that, it made the game more manageable. I was able to advance. 
---
That was definitely harder, no doubt.
---
People also seem to be forgetting about the spiders in skyrim, given it's a bethesda game...
---
The unique bosses combined with the timer and the mutations pulls off for some really unique and fun fights. I wish the enemies would stop having perception mutations though so that I can use sneak.
---
The next thing Bethesda could do is add raid-style Dungeons  where you have to defeat bosses with certain mechanics.
---
No problem 👍thats good to know it can be done
---
I would say it's a Syndicate Commune. As it's run by workers, for workers.
---
I'm 10 percent sure that removing my Protocolled chest piece caused me to run out of AP before I got to the finish line, I was running slower.
---
But the perk implies that they changed their mind. Why would they include the perk to the game otherwise?
---
Contrary to Follow through and Taking one for the team, I don't think tenderizer and suppressor is a debuff on target (is it ?) so even if players have them, it doesn't have to influence your damages
---
Oh wow thanks. I’ll be sure to check it out :D
---
Or maybe add some competition for the Wayward in a future update. 
---
The Wayward seems like a more rough and tumble crowd, so maybe we can get some upscale types coming back to revitalize Morgantown, start up the University, etc. Kind of a snooty, eastern equivalent to the Followers.
---
I laughed, but then I got sad.
---
3 stashbox for me and a ops suit so i guess i'm lucky at the end.
---
I got it on my second attempt, but I'm still waiting to get the gut pile 20+ runs in
---
Yep, have crashed about four times since the patch; hadn’t had a blue screen in a fair bit prior. Plenty of lag as well. (PS4.)
---
One option is to switch to Junkies, then you can run full health.   That's what I run.  With the new way modifers are being calculated there isn't as much of a gap between the two as there used to be.
---
Oh, and the new amours (Secret Service, T65) are much more tanky.   I don't have a full set of SS armour yet, but I did switch from X01 and Ultracite PA to T65 and it made a huge difference in the damage that I take when doing the Colossal Problem event.
---
I got 8 minutes bang on and it counted towards the elder rank
---
This is one of my biggest irks. That or corner stairs to make more compact builds
---
As far as I know they are all target debuffs.
---
Or, as the game should have had from the start, a text chat
---
Swap out grim reaper for crit savy.
---
Hmm, that is concerning. I hope Angry Turtle will test them.
---
In *theory*, communism is perfect. In practice however, corruption and greed stops it being viable.
---
I share tenderiser so anyone can weaken enemies if we fight different ones
---
Hold on, so you’re telling me that different people have different perspectives, experiences and opinions on things?
---
That’s preposterous.
---
Now that you mention it, I don't recall them ever seeming to care about robots.
---
Not looking for it but if i get it, usually i get to the end of the diseace for my imune system, you know...
---
Every region has it's own fissure site. These could be made prime and spawn different bosses: Deathclaw King in the savage Divide. Mole miner executive in the Ash Heap and the Mothman King in the Forest
---
I've asked him yesterday. He will test it. :)
---
A slab or ramp would be nice.
---
A gate for the commie fence would be nice, too.
---
If you like the world of fallout, I think it’s worth trying. It’s gotten a lot better with the recent updates.
---
A single, manly tear was shed.
---
Well remember at the start of S1 it looked like there would just barely be enough dailies/weeklies to get to 100, then they upped the quantity of both.
---
Now they are starting off S2 with that raised quantity so folks will take it easier this time round anyways.
---
"Playing"  
---
I really thought we could have a play but it's just an animation...
---
Are there changes to multiplayer ops? Do enemies get higher levels or more damage resistance or anything like that? Can't find the info anywhere yet so I've been staying out in order to not potentially make things harder.
---
 could you imagine a big ass spider boss?  Nuke the forest(spiders would hang round there I guess?) The whole server can fight it like SBQ. Make it not as hard as SBQ because forest is for low levels. Cripple it's limbs so it can't move as fast. Would be nice for a low level boss for low levels to fight so they get used to boss battles later on in the game. We can dream I guess 😏
---
Caveat; 308 mg with the right legendary is a magic weapon capable of melting just about anything.
---
I'm PA with speed demon real no issues on time been finishing around 7:34-7:54. Geting the legendary sprint cost reduction helped. Maybe trying running it a few times to get to know the path better to take the best path, and always stay on the signal boosters.
---
It looks good. But I fear it’s a bit too modern for fallout.
---
And I thought my 250 supers was insane! Considering I'm a bloodied build I seem to maintain my stimpacks very well. Earle seems to be the only fight that makes me lose the most stimpacks
---
I did n't have that issue in both my runs so guess I got lucky.
---
I got a Bloodied 308 mg with 25% FFR and 15% reload speed on my main, running ultracite reciever, thing is insane out of power armour in sneak whilst ADS'ing. 
---
Actually out preforms the armour pen while in the PA
---
Small guns and energy bobble heads both broken.
---
They don't add any bonus damage at all.
---
Ur absolute right.
---
I'm respec'ing from heavy gunner to bloodied commando as we speak.
---
Not that it's bad- but I JUST got my first bloodied 3 star weapons in the lvl 130's.....
---
Changing all those strength cards to perception... Leveling up 3 rifleman cards, etc requires LEVELING UP.
---
This change in the system helps A BUNCH
---

---
Yeha that's what I meant. They can remove a hand, make the reload animation for the right hand and mirror it so that it's the same on the other side
---
I run around with an Excavator power armor set that has modded legs netting +200 carry weight
---
There are plenty of serious outfits. And I get people want more military outfits but this fallout, so too “tacticool” skins can go against the general aesthetics of the universe/lore.
---
Knuckles should have been dual weild as standard. Like in the other games.
---
&gt;It's not supposed to be an ammo farm. I think it should consume resources, and that's why you get some of the ammo back. 
---
That's nice if you think that, but the devs stated the opposite. They outright said you'd probably end it with more ammo than you started, with means being hundreds in the negative is a design fail for 50 cal machine gun users.
---
Would it though? Workshops are still pvp and there is nothing to stop a player claiming or contesting as many as they like.
---
Reloading the game should fix this.
---
Yes ! Very good ! He's the best for testing !
---
Yeah, I barely managed that in just over 14 minutes. Felt like at least thirty when doing it. Went full melee perk loadout with my ski sword, a buttload of psychobuff, and the classic tactic of screaming abuse at them in real life while charging in. It was not fun, especially with a boss that took a good three minutes of slashing without stopping before he finally fell.
---
I don't think it would be a good idea, there's other things that need attention. This would take so much work and countless patches to make it work properly.
---
Yeah it's probably their hammer logo. It creates this Socialist type feel but they're just a blue collar settlement of families.
---
Pacifist solves this problem every time
---
yeah hes like a fallout scientist. :)
---
I either ask Imprezobus or him, I stopped asking here because everything you get here is bullshit.
---
I ended up with 360 screws from one event and i didn't even do much to them just hit the mobs and watched higher lvls kill them with one shots was awesome
---
I don’t! I just hide. Get kills too, if someone comes in.
---
I think it would look weird. I've never understood dual wielding in games, how would you reload 2 pistols at the same time? You'd need 4 arms!
---
It would take forever to reload 2 pistols.
---
This is what some ppl do thinking your beneath them... Low level character in here? He doesn't belong.smh
---
Are you bashing with your shotgun? :D
---
overall you can say the game got harder due to two reasons,
---
one wasteland makes it so every enemy scales to your level up to a certain point
---
in the forest for example the max level is 50 and in the bog i think its 100
---
also bethesda changed the way damage is calculated from multiplicative rather than additive
---
as an example on how that works, lets say you have a weapon with a base damage of 100
---
your adding a reciever that makes the damage 150 and all three rifleman perks at rank 3
---
before the patch this would have meant your doing:
---
100* 1.5* 1.2* 1.2* 1.2= 259 damage on a non stealth body shot (not accounting for armor)
---
now after the patch, your doing:
---
100*(1+0.5+0.2+0.2+0.2)=100*2.1=210
---
obviously this is a bit oversimplified but overall thats how it should work now
---
the change was implemented to make future balance changes easier for the developers.
---
while some users barely noticed the difference, some suffer greatly from it
---
a stealth commando for example who needs one more shot to kill stuff wont notice a big difference in his gameplay whereas someone with a sniper rifle will definitely notice a huge difference in there gameflow
---
some damage multiplyers are still multiplicative such as double damage for headshots or the damage bonus from the instigating effec as far as i am aware.
---
Stealth multiplyers seem not to work properly atm
---
you can expect the developers to look into the whole topic in the near future as you are not alone with your problems.
---
Overall this topic is highly debated but for the bigger part of the community, the changes where welcome and added a little more challenge to the game.
---
Sadly some are left behind atm and you as a low level rifleman are pretty much one of those players that was hit the hardest.
---
as a solution for now
---
if you want to stick with rifleman, atm for oneshots at your level, your best bet would be a railway rifle or an instigating lever action/hunting rifle
---
your other solution would be a fast firing rifle like a semi auto handmade but you wont oneshot enemies
---
overall though your better option would probably be to switch over too commando but you most likely dont have the level ups to respec your damage points for now
---
id suggest you watch some of the youtube videos from guys like angry turtle, they explain the situation quite well and once you understand the matter its possible to find a workaround
---
Those legendary card did help me get back to even after update
---
There's a client and a server, the server knows where everything and everyone is on the server at all times. All it takes is writing an API call on the server that the client can call before loading, asking...
---
&gt;  my camp is at X Y coords, can I place it? And the server returns yes or no.
---
There's no technical reason they can't do this.
---
I was doing baaaad
---
Resilient. It’s a crappy mutation that has been complained about for ever in the PTS.
---
Bethesda should remove it until they can get the lag down low enough so bashing hits would actually *** register.
---
I did the same thing.  Ran with two new characters for the first legendary season because it's easier to level up new character.  
---
I also made up my mind to play the characters as-is with no help from my main or stash of legendary weapons until they got to at least level 65.  
---
I didn't find it that bad.  I could tell when the current weapon wasn't cutting it anymore and it was time to switch it up to either melee or sneak rifle, etc.  
---
I did get one legendary drop that helped a lot on one character, I got a level 25 bloodied shotgun.  Needless to say, it was quite effective all the way up to level 40 on that character.
---
I did employ a couple slightly advanced strategies for the perk cards.  I tried to only pick perk cards at every 10 levels.  This way I was less likely to get dupes from the perk card packs.  I also knew that you could pick a SPECIAL point but pick a card from another category if there wasn't any good cards available in the category you put the point in.  This helped a lot to reduce wasting perk points.
---
Perks cards and SPECIAL points are something that most new players don't really understand well enough and it can be the difference between the game being just a bit challenging and it being really hard.
---
I haven't been able to get Elder ranking yet because I can't get more than one other person to fucking join. It's annoying.
---
That would make trap camps that little bit more interactive. 
---
"...I want to a play game"
---
Guass rifle?
---
started lvling up a new character just before one wasteland and was about 20 when it hit, and tbh i certainly noticed the difference, but i cant say i have struggled much at all after lvl 25 when i could use my Lever Rifle. cant one shot but it normally just takes 2 headshots from sneak and 5 shots without. and at 49 now im using a 35 junkie lever and having a blast \^\^  
---
got lvl 50 junkie crossbow waiting as i wanna try a bow build, and not that hard to change back to rifle if i want \^\^
---
Another good way for ultracite Cores is to run ops. Switch to the weapon just as it ends Boom 2-4 free Cores for free.
---
You mean like in Grounded?
---
*sound of gatling plasma spinning up*
---
I always considered them to be more Tribal. Like a typical settlement in post-apocalyptic world that is open to trading with the others.
---
I'd go with Anything Goes just to shit on the supposed effort Julie took fixing the radio station up lol. Not that I have any issues with her as the host or anything, I just feel like it should be that.
---
Do people actually mind that? I mean, this is 2020.
---
Second this, i rock an arm and two legs of raider armour purely for aesthetics.
---
Its should be' something like a dungeon finder
---
Easy peasy for me and my Gauss Minigun but the thing is it’ll be that way for others. They either put more time in like the rest of us or get lucky.
---
Above and beyond my friend. 👍
---
They’ve always done this. :) It is interesting to listen to them, though! I like Samuel’s conversations - poor guy is so awkward haha.
---
After rank 15 it slows down considerably..now it's just pure Grind fest. Not doing like season 1. I'm taking it my pace.
---
I don't know Imprezobus, also a YT?
---
I got both forest and urban masks and the BOS, white spring, and white powder jumpsuits from the One Violent Night event.
---
Excavator always added +100 carry weight while wearing a full set. +100 more if both legs have calibrated shocks
---
I am sitting on 2800+ notes myself. It is ridiculous to have a daily limit of 20...
---
Four leaf clover, I would say.
---
It should tell me that my camp be placed and ask me if I want to join that server before loading! There's a couple situations where you'd want to join a server that doesn't have space for your camp, such as joining a friend or someone from a LFG/clan discord to do some event.
---
your welcome 👍🏼
---
The alternative was having your camp immediately deleted.
---
Stand by for lots of PvP/thieving after looting her body. Wasn't the idea to make the flux disappear so it didn't drop and in your loot encouraging griefers. Why don't they just make it an Aid or Misc item that can't be dropped unless you select it?...(too simple?)
---
Yea that's no fun either.
---
Dude... The +200 was fixed several months ago, haven't been around lately?
---
No I mean they're bugged. They're literally "magic" in that they're doing far *far* more damage than they actually should.
---
I have an LMG with 50% limb damage legendary(one of the magic legendary effects) on it. [And it absolutely melts things in far less time than it should.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs)
---
All premade should have this option. The normal stairs are so ugly to put.
---
Feminist moment
---
A must do for the game! All you need is a accuracy debuff and it'll be matrix style
---
I wonder if the notifications are bugged because I joined an ops team and no I’m ever did any ops and there’s no way to find to find out if the ops already going.
---
I wish it would check this and load my base. Nothing worse than falling off a cliff before my base has loaded so I have to fast travel back to it. Or loading in my floor and getting stuck but because im at my base I cannot fast travel to it. So I travel somewhere else and back or delete the floor im in and ruin my base.
---
I'm calling cap
---
Start a new character.
---
I have a feeling this guy doesn't like level 75 Mr Gutsies
---
It was the thing I was looking forward to most about One Wasteland... they seem to have forgotten about it.
---
That's true, but not everyone likes to wear power armour so I was suggesting alternatives.
---
Doing the Burrows solo would be impossible in PA, as far as I can tell.
---
Because i wasn't following the legendary perks news so i dunno if the perk was new or from the begining of the system?  Plus with there still being benefits... people will still want to have it topped off.  I'm just not one that wants to worry about it all the time.
---
Bethesda has a lot of stuff that is redendant and goofy and sometimes working against their ideas in their games.
---
I asked because google isn't being useful or the words i'm putting in are too genereic to get me info.
---
I can't imagine i was the only person looking forward to this aspect and that i'm the only person that missed the boat when it changed from ''a thing'' to ''not a thing''.
---
I don't struggle, I have a stealth rifleman /commando full health build, I now need two / three shots to kill things until adrenaline kicks in, instead of one shoting everything. I have had to move lots of perk points around to achieve this. but It hasn't really affected me
---
Hes a well known pvp player who knows a lot.
---
Im more of a trench coat kinda guy. Mainly because my favorite outfit was the courier duster from New Vegas. I hope we get more outfits like that one in the future.
---
That assumption is based on having good trades, experience in the market and a large amount of caps.
---
I pump at least 10-20 stims during an Earle fight and still get out with more than i had before, it seems the Wendigo's drop them more when killed with melee, but that could just be a placebo.
---
They unlock with specific triggers, those aren't all saved up and done at once when you switch. New toon is the only way if you're an achievement/trophy hunter :-)
---
I would say it really depends on how many points in luck you have.
---
Higher luck crit savvy is better and more consistent. 
---
So you go crit savvy and whatever the crit damage boost one is. 
---
Low luck you'll probably get better milage on four leaf. But your luck would have to be low.
---
I think the note is takeable, so someone may have gotten it before you.
---
I have two caracters, both are some poorly made builds. It's just for casual roleplay. One using PA and one sneaker. Got some deasent weapons, but not OP in any way. And this is my desition and I accept the rules of the game. Would not care to criticize over this game...
---
Is it just me? But I think I can recall a Bethesda note about remaking/balancing the whole damage system later this year? Was this it? Or will there be more to come?
---
My sneak build has a combat shotgun for close encounters. And the only thing I really dislike [drama pause] is the rubber damage from shotguns. Is it really reversed vampire? Don't get it! Lol...
---
Omg I am so mad, I have a greenhouse build and the rain always bothers me to no end, Bethesda I beg you, fix it! (Also hoooow are people finishing so fast??? I am barely hitting rank 20! 😢)
---
There’s a post on here  with a photo link if you scroll back some pages , looks quite cool
---
Did you just come out of coma? Welcome! We have COVID now!
---
It was posted today? I'm searching reddit posts from Google about the event but so far they're all just the loot tables
---
Nah, did it today. Main thing try not to super hero land. That fucks everything up.
---
Considering stash limits exist to stop the servers falling over, they would need to get new servers that aren't 20 years old to support this kind of thing
---
depends on the weapon, on shotguns for example, four leaf clover has a chance to proc for every single pellet making it very effective
---
on fast firing weapons, critical savy would probably be more consistent
---
Nope definitely not
---
Burrows was a couple of days ago...
---
Happened to me last night. Thankfully I still got credit and actually got into another one and beat the timer.
---
Awwww yeah, that layout was so easy to navigate! Even the enemies freezing you didn’t slowed you that much, I hated today’s (invisible enemies) I kept getting lost so bad 😢
---
I'm not sure because the bos were ever the most nodern fraction in fallout. The Gauss Shotgun would be too modern too or not? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; I’m maxing out ammo factory also. I don’t see them coming out with a better version of this card.
---
Ummm. What about if they make it worse? Remember "White Knight?"
---
No. And there is a rest bonus xp for sleeping in game.
---
Not for being logged out. Would be kinda cool tho.
---
Eyyyyy you helped plenty! The uplink goes faster the more people are in the area!
---
my camp is getting destroyed everytime this happens..
---
I have the keeping up problem. I'm so used to searching everything in fallout games. Finally got used to the lag with enemy's damage so the game isn't as brutal as it can seem from the update. Still on "normal" weapons cause I used perks to boost food, water and rads to stay alive longer roaming. I'm finding out fast, that's not gonna cut it for very much longer. I'm not a PVP player so I'm thinking of one of the invisible builds for my roaming habits.
---
Ok imagine this, a new perk card under luck called pistol fury. Where you have a percentage chance to get 100% vats accuracy dual pistols but you empty both mags on the shot. The second pistol would appear as a Kind of semi transparent one. It would be like the mysterious stranger perk in a way. You would use a lot of bullets but probably kill what ever you where shooting at.
---
Ah found it in the comments of another post. Thanks! Pretty much the same as the croc pack but a gorilla. Still gonna snag it for sure
---
Oooo and make the mini gun shredder mod do damage shen spun uo and jabbed into people.
---
Post 4 hours ago by u/Vault310 someone included a datamine link and someone else a photo link (sorry don’t know how to include link to posts)
---
Dang, the hoard is strong with you xD.
---
I sell all stims after 30 and super stims at 15 and I've never run out. So you can do it, you can chuck them!
---
Where's your god now?!
---
Yeah , I got the croc by trading for some 5.56 ammo
---
Also use a damn mic people.  Joined a team last night and missed the 8 minute mark because people were wasting time killing shit.  I was trying to talk to them to get them to move.  By the time they started it was too late and we missed it by like 20 seconds.  Use a fucking mic please.

Bivs quest seem like an early thing whereas the collosus is one of the end game bosses so I think it makes more sense to get the buff for that boss in another late game tier thing, like getting the best tier in daily ops for a chance at it. I don't think it should be rewarded on easy quests or events. Although the daily ops can be easy at times but definitely more challenging than most things
---
Fallout is set in the post apocalyptic future, but with a 60’s aesthetic. Gauss Shotgun, ultracite laser rifle, etc all of those things follow the general aesthetic of fallout. Most stuff on the atomic shop this far have been aesthetically speaking lore friendly.
---
But this outfit is imo kinda touching the line between rainbow 6 aesthetic and fallout aesthetic.
---
At least the headphones have a traditional fallout’y branding on it.
---
I had the exact same thing happen to me!
---
I didn't rush S1, and I sure as shit won't rush S2. I'll get whatever I get, and that's it. I'd rather not waste my time doing challenges.
---
My bad for some reason I was thinking todays Fire one. Yeah Burrows was hard, doable but hard. Don't kill just stim up and run. Because of the resilient mutation. Try to get the lego perk card that reduced your ap sprint cost.
---
I have a gauss rifle and still use max rank for tanky targets like Mirelurk Queens,  Scorchbeasts and Behemoths for example.
---
I want to make this one last till the end cause last time I didn’t and got bored without the feedback loop 😅
---
They've come down in price quite a bit from the first event and these new plans have a better drop chance. Dont know if the drop rate is higher, but there's less crap in the drop pool this time around. I already have the full DC hunter outfit, strong man outfit, and anamatronic clown. Just want that pack, the lamp, and the plushie and im all set
---
Spiders do not exist as actually living beings in the existing Fallout lore. As in, they've never appeared in any of the games as enemies, and there's no mention of them in the wiki. There are giant spiders in the [Wastelad](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelad) holotape game, and there may be some passiong mentions of spiders somewhere in terminals or notes or in dialogue, but they don't actually exist in the lore as living creatures decades after Fallout 76.
---
I can't find any reason given for this, which means it was never explained by the guys behind the first two Fallout games. They just arbitrarily decided that certain other animals wouldn't exist either, such as horses I believe. The extinction of horses, mules and donkeys is mentioned in the Fallout Bible, but since I believe the fate of spiders is never mentioned, I don't know if they're actually extinct or not.
---
Having said that, seeing as how Fallout 76 takes several decades before the original games (2103 for Fallout 76 currently, 2161 for the original Fallout), there *could* still be spiders in some form roaming the woods and caves of Appalachia. However, there would have to be a reason why we haven't seen them in the past year (in-game time, from 2102 as the vault opened, to 2103 now.)
---
Then, of course, there would have to be a reason why there's no sign of them six decades later. Then again, we've got the scorched and cryptids in West Virginia as well, and they're not mentioned later either, so having spiders might not be that out of the question.
---
But yeah, the Wastelad holotape game mentions [mutated giant spiders](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_spider), so perhaps this pre-war fiction would become a temporary reality in Appalachia at some point?
---
Then again, arachnophobes wouldn't be happy, and who can blame them. I don't have a *fear* of spiders personally, but I'm fine with the game not having giant, eight-legged nopes in it.
---
**EDIT:** Clarified a few things here and there.
---
Praise the Emperor and pass the ammunition?
---
That could actually be helpful. This isn't about "why is this so hard", this is about "why is it twice as hard as last week". We learned how to play within the limits of the old rules, and we're currently having difficulty adapting in the new ones.
---
It would be very instructive and helpful to see what the build is, the exact weapons and damage you're getting, and how you're accumulating ammo. The nature of the ammo problem has been shifting as folks move to making ammo. The normal locations have been empty for the last 2 days (weight rooms, Lucky Mine, etc), so it would be interesting to see if you build, buy, or continue with Events at a low level.
---
My camp, I have a stupid amount of alcohol to replenish my bowl and my nuka machine, but people never seem to wanna drink 🥺
---
Yeah it's a bit weird this, noticed it yesterday.
---
I've been looking for a one wasteland build, and this look like the one for me. Any hints you can give vis. a vis. good weapons?
---
Also, if PA does prevent limb damage, what would you replace skeleton with? Cheers.
---
Yeah if it was for all those people with a gazillion presents to waste I never would have had the chance to trade and get mine, these ones look more reachable
---
I have marsupial but not able to upgrade the power armour yet. And only have a few power cells for it that are low. I tend to go off track lol I've done maybe 8 or so story missions but have all but 3 bobble heads. I'm bad for picking a direction and just going to see what I find. It's worked for bobble heads at least tho.
---
Hopfully. The new plans are selling fairly cheap on the market sub and even found some in people vendors for like 1k caps
---
Communists don't use currency?
---
As a heavy gunner, I wholeheartedly agree.
---
Please no. This is the *one* well balanced thing about this patch. They’re called *legendary* perks for a reason. If every cunt has it, they’ll nerf it again and again until it’s not so legendary any more. Either put in the work or lose out. Simple.
---
Give this legendary perk also 50% faster reload speed when dual wielding. Problem solved.
---
Besides, we have quite few weapons which take a long time to reload. I don't get the issue with slow reload when those still exist.
---
Edit: [This is how dual wielding modders did reload in F4](https://youtu.be/JbDKEGHeefU?t=165).
---
Its the worst Fallout ever made. But still better than most other games so I'll enjoy it until Fallout 5 is there.
---
Thanks, I haven't delved into legendary perks. It looks like reduced ap usage is the way to go. 👍
---
Had someone join at the very end the other day. Seemed like he was doing that on purpose. :( Come on man.
---
I think so, the true definition of communism is a Moneyless, Classless and Stateless society.
---
Hence why there’s never been a true communist country.
---
Just got the Glaive plan from the Daily op, bearing in mind I have no Melee buffs or weapon crafting buffs for melee weapons and my strength is 18  
---
Base weapon damage is 171 for me, knowing nothing about the melee side of the game, I don't actually know if that is good on not but I assume it is.
---
It's now possible to completely disable pvp so it shouldn't be an issue.
---
I have seen players companions at the SBQ about 5 times. They're always fighting the entire event. Too bad we can't give companions better weapons.
---
I can solo it under 8 min consistently. I have no problem with any level joining me.
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
Sugargrove command room
---
I heard if you drop one in front of them during a confrontation they will pick it up and keep it until you switch servers
---
Same here. PA with (nearly) every weight reduction perk in game. Heavy weapons still shred.
---
Everybody seems to have lol.  Cept us.  We get our own crazy corner of the internet.
---
Exactly what I thought too. We had the information and we're still waiting for its conclusion...
---
I'm in the same boat as your friends, level 85, no 'good gear' and no build (or a food build if you will) and I haven't noticed any great jump in difficulty. Sure I'm not one-shotting things that spawn in the forest any more but it's not made getting where I want to go without being killed any harder.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Yes :)
---
Same here, game is almost unplayable now.   
---
No idea what's brought it on. =/
---
I'm Level 26 and the update completely fucked up game balance for me, need three point blank shotgun shells to the torso to kill a weak feral ghoul
---
Only through using a private world with fallout 1st.
---
Or a friend who has it.
---
I can make one up for you.
---
Gt is same as here QuakeSumo
---
I'm at level 28 on PC and really only participate for SCORE but enjoy getting the rewards. In general, my experience has been positive and I can only recall one obvious encounter with a hacker, i.e. guy floating in the sky one shotting everyone (editorial comment - pathetic). Otherwise, most game play seemed legit.
---
I can hook you up with one my GT is Denon Channy
---
You don’t need guides. You want to do 2 handed melee? Take the 3 perks that say you do more 2 handed melee damage.
---
That’s it.
---
Lol 1 rank of tenderizer gives me a 16% boost in dmg. Sure not good.
---
On the flip side, you can’t just suddenly forget how to pick a lock to deal more damage with your rifle, and you can’t just forget how to use your gun so you can pick a lock. Passive perks like Super Duper, Scrapper, lock picking and hacking don’t directly affect your gameplay. They’re passive perks.
---
&gt;That assumption is based on having good trades, experience in the market and a large amount of caps.
---
Not even remotely.
---
The thing YOU'RE assuming is that I'm talking about top tier meta gear. I'm just talking hodge podge 1\*. You can get that kind of thing EASILY for less than 10k. If you're willing to shop around a bit, less than 5k without that much extra effort vendor hopping. Not even max level gear or heavy armour version. The effect is far stronger than what the armour itself provides.
---
Heck, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if someone asked nicely here in the sub or a 76 discord for a basic 1\* mismatched set of bloodied, people would jump at the chance to help out the community for free.
---
I got my first set of unyielding for free on discord just because I showed an interest in the build but wasn't sure about it. Didn't even ask for it. It was just offered to me.
---
There is one, you can roll it legendary on enemies, not buying the plans for gold
---
Really?! Are you on now?
---
I modded my handmade to 111 accuracy. 😳
---
Yeah im online right now
---
I want dual wielding and fanning for Revolvers.
---
There is a grave stone loot bag. And a gift one. A duffle bag one. A pile of bones. A duffle bag. And paratrooper bag (currently in atom shop). And possibly others I've forgotten
---
Oh my gosh thanks! Don't we have to be in the same server though? 🤔 how do I find you?
---
You can do that. There are a few atomshop option, and you can select the dropbag and lootbag seperately.
---
I believe it was determined that pa speed wasn't effected by speed demon. 
---
My pa character doesn't have it and my speed demon character doesn't have pa. Can't test this myself.
---
Look my gamertag up on xbox and join my game. My gamertag is Denon Channy. Or just tell me yours and ill invite you
---
You can set 2 loot bags actually, one for drops and one for deaths. There is a gravestone loot bag, should come back in October
---
Oh, thanks guys, I didn't notice
---
You can modify visual, yes. Some mods do that.  
---
Again the number are calculated by the server. (This is why we have this incredibly painful rubber band damage effect sometimes) .
---
But magic weapon are "bugged" weapon, not "hacked" weapon. You can't build a weapon and manipulate the stats. You can only exploit bugs.  
---
And I give you that, there are many many bug in the game...
---
You need a weapon with 33% VATS hit chance, 15 perception, full unyielding armor (with 20% health of course), shielded raider underarmor and eagle eyes mutation. If you have a female character or dont mind crossdressing you can add the tattered dress.
---
I found you. I'm ViciousC30
---
Meet me at White Springs Station
---
Usually they drop same weapon as what they were using. Exceptions are  when they use different types of weapons (switching from ranged to melee for example).
---
I don't know, I have gotten tons of help on this sub. Honestly, I don't know if I would even find out how to start the game up (problems with a file) without their help, and they have helped me on alot of stuff that has been bothering me with the game. And now I am actually enjoying it. I haven't tried playing since they nerfed the stuff, and I do not think it's the best game ever, but the community is great.
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
This is the smallest if not just non-existent obstacle. I really doubt huge majority  really cares about such thing, especially when there are already other illogicial things in game.
---
Hang on. I got booted out. Be back soon
---
Will do
---
yeah, I see the reused the asset for the ammo converter, so at least it wasn’t fully wasted.
---
This need upvoting !! Agree a zillion percent
---
I found the opposite, I join the ops team and no one is playing it. I guess maybe I could start it but since I was the 4th to join, I left it to the team lead. Next time I will start and see if they join too.
---
Maybe, like allow you to play a pipboy minigame?
---
😂
---
I would add bring a knife with you to quickly melee adds for the high levels
---
Ps4?
---
It'd also make things interesting if the weapon they're using is a legendary too. Would make some fights quite interesting like instigating doing double damage on you if you're at full health, executioners destroying bloodied builds, bloodied weapons making their attacks stronger the lower their health is so you'd want to make sure that if you start attacking them, you better finish it off quick.
---
Having said that though, it could make looting kinda weird because if multiple people attack the same dude, they would all get the same legendary weapon.
---
&gt;	Oh and how about adding rest XP boost
---
...this is already in the game
---
That's their mating call, you're just misinterpreting it.
---
or just improve the user interface on the device
---
no idea why they cant just make it be like a vendor interface with the slidy bar to select how much ammo to convert
---
I was thinking maybe as well it can be customizable or a perk.
---
Between this and the survival shortcut I can stop carrying food and meds.
---
Can get rid of food and med weight reduction perks and aquaboy and free up a bunch of perk ppints
---
Tenderize here too.
---
Make sure you have the starched genes perk so you dont lose the mutation
---
The perk is called concentrated fire...
---
Though a different perk with a similar effect such that you can target body parts would be nice. Bethesda would have to do actual work to get it into the game because it was never apart of Fallout 4 but still.
---
I didn't realise this was a thing 🤦‍♀️ I've hated the daily ops the last two days I've played, because I've been up against ten chameleon blood eagle slayers at level 50 (I'm a weak 57). I got fairly far in last season and was disappointed when I saw the daily ops contributed to so much success on weeklies. This makes so much more sense, I've no idea how I missed it. Thank you!
---
How does it work, I don’t see it on mine?
---
Hmm did not think about that
---
You’re asking this in a sub where everyone plays the game... of course we are going to say yes.
---
I didn’t know that, cool!
---
Eventually it will be just he apologists for this game alone together.  I never understood the rationality of a subset of people here and on the official forums that constantly rail against the large portion of people that complain about decisions they make for this game, while player counts just continue to drop.   It's pretty simple when Bethesda ignore the majority and try to appease a smaller group and don't listen more, the game is going to die.  I am guessing we are getting close to free to play as a last ditch effort.   I honestly figured it would have happened by now.
---
as someone who stopped a few months after launch and came back in april - yes imo ! its awesome now.
---
The one thing I will say about this patch is that my build won't really be changed much at all. I play a heavy armor/furious ffr build and didn't really get into the bloodied/junkies builds. I also didn't rely on the fast fire rate bug. So the game will probably feel the same for me. Better, actually, with the new ammo factory legendary helping me craft the ammo I need.
---
I need to figure out what other legendary perks I want. The addition of SPECIAL legendary perks lets me bring back some perks I had to give up due to point restrictions.
---
I guess there is no way to pick a specific world, drop stuff, log in alt to same world, get stuff?
---
At least 1 point in concentrated fire perk in perception, target the rocket boosters using vats crits with your best gun to slow it down. Take 1 or 2 Of those out and it ends up hovering directly above you and you can finish it off much easier!
---
I used to share stranger in numbers but everyone I join does too and most people already have it so I switched to tenderise because it's useful and not as many people have or share it
---
Thanks for the feedback! I'll consider redownloading it again. Oh and happy cake day!
---
Do you Sneak or Crit?
---
Look, other people's opinions are based on their views, so it's hard to be genuinely  unbiased when convincing people to come back to a game that disappointed them before.
---
The game is better than on release, but there are still issues, something that caused you to give up first time may still not be fixed. Or, there might be a new bug that annoys you enough to drop the game again.
---
Give the game another go, maybe a week or two, and see if it impresses you, or disappoints. No one can guarantee you'll be convinced it's worth your time.
---
Glad I’m not the only one who claims Tyler county from inside the porta potties
---
Whats the max dam
---
U can muster / im getting 400 base 
---
With no buffs just the build
---
If you want a completely bug, glitch and exploit free game this isn't the one for you
---
Why am I not surprised...
---
thats really a point they might not have thought through. when i play games like fallout, i want to discover everything and open every door. so i was around level 70 when i started the i am become death quest with a shitty rifleman build and the worst equip. it took forever to down that drone (also, first one fell into a tree, 10m above me with no possibility to reach it. thanks). it was that point, where i overthought my build and was gifted a ts hm. but back to the point: with one wasteland, that drone would have had an even higher level and its possible, that i would never have passed that quest and left the game in agony.  
---
perhaps a lvl cap for certain quest related enemies could be a solution.
---
of course 👍🏻 if i can help elaborate on anything lmk, but i totally think its been fun despite the grind being pretty intense, lol. welcome back!!!! also thank you so much :)
---
Daily ops plans will likely remain also so even less value there
---
I've had quite a few short freezes on mine.
---
On the road south of Abby's Bunker there's a truck being pulled into the trees by strangler vines: up to three wendigo spawn up in the trees around the truck
---
I think I have an alt that doesn't have the mutation but does have the serum. Will test.
---
I would submit a ticket
---
You could still decide to join anyway just like now.
---
I’ve killed raiders who are using heavy guns and gotten a laser pistol or shotgun. I mean, it’s possible they’re carrying multiple weapons but that heavy gun is nowhere to be seen.
---
I got to 44 in the last 2 weeks last season
---
As a single handed melee/ pistol user - How is there NOT dual pistols, dual swords or a pistol swords combo? Criminal
---
Doesn’t well rested last 2-3 hours with a companion romanced?
---
I guess you... brought a knife to a gun fight
---
They need daily logins, their plan is working
---
Xbox? If so gt?
---
You sleep for 60 seconds and get a well-rested bonus
---
Instead of fucking over casuals, why not have a difficulty slider in options? With one wasteland this clearly is possible.
---
Another place to go, thanks mate. 👍🍻
---
I’m just happy when my vats hits do damage in melee. Constantly seeing my damage numbers roll up with no damage.
---
They should have 2 worlds one like before and one for people who only play fallout 76
---
Because the last hit is explosion not vats kill
---
yeah, sometimes it gets hilarious. yesterday i crafted some secret service armor and went out of plastic. no big deal, short trip to huntersville and west tec and pick up the laser rifles. 70% of the mutants shot red lasers at me and i could pick up 3 laser rifles. doesnt sound fair but in a strange falloutlogic way, why not :D
---
haven't seen that but i did encounter a forager on a road in the middle of nowhere with no camp anywhere in sight
---
You have 3 separate chances. 1 for each tier. If you complete elder your first try it rolls all 3 chances
---
No, doesn’t seem dumb to me that you can’t just change your character that easily on a whim.  People shouldn’t be able to equip “What Rads” just for Radiation Rumble, go back to camp scrap it and equip “Ammo Factory” to make a ton of ammo, then scrap that and jump in their power armor with another perk card,
---
&gt;This isn't a single player game that can cater to weekend warriors, or even casual players like myself.
---
For 2 years it did. This was the game we bought. I also have no problem killing things, but I can understand people that do. 
---
 "Then go play Minecraft? " Go play in a busy the road?
---
Legendary perks aren't meant to be easily swappable. Same as how it's not supposed to be easy to upgrade them to max. Hence the word legendary.
---
Well, explaining away lies doesn't always work. The stash limit bullshit got called out as bullshit before it was proven bullshit.
---
I mean, i'm biased. I didn't struggle at all leveling strictly in the PVP server, because I wasn't stupid and actually put points into what I was doing. Pistols I knew would be agility, melee i knew would be strength, and i knew endurance would be for survivability. I had a backup heavy sledge for some encounters, and I moved my CAMP around a lot early. 
---
I kept pipe pistols and .38 ammo because it was in abundance. I was fine because I had common sense.
---
I am sure there are some balancing issues , but i simply don't believe it is as bad as everyone is saying it is. I firmly believe you can't just yolo your stats and perks early and expect to be effective, so yes, if you're a FRESH fallout player and you come in going "haha luck sounds fun", don't utilize all the weapons you get early on because all weapons are generally the same usefulness until you get perk cards for your chosen weapon, don't utilize grenades or cooking items from killing an animal every now and again , you're going to struggle. You have to use your head to level now, there's PLENTY of other ways you can just ignore the story and grou pup for events to leech some experience. 
---
Except for ammo economy, Super Mutants, and Charred Ghouls. Those i'm damn sure need a rebalance for lower levels because those were cancer when I played, and i can't imagine what that is now.
---
I spent time yesterday trying out a bunch of different weapons I had stored away. The only thing I found was a glitch that won't allow me to switch back to my Gauss Rifle without manually selecting it from the weapons wheel.
---
Strange when posters criticize other posters for criticizing on a discussion forum.
---
Going as far as writing  posts criticizing to tell you this. :-)
---
Ironic much.
---
I agree with you OP.
---
A lot of players struggling since this update.They are right to feel unhappy.
---
It is not like the game got any easier anyway,until you reach level 50.
---
Airing how they feel on Reddit helps,feedback.
---
It just works
---
buy ranks and/or xp farming
---
Well TIL something else about Marxism.
---
I did find that Marx suggested labor credits at one point, but not one that could be traded among people. That's an idea Beth seems to have jumped on.
---
Anyway, hammers+scrip is certainly suspicious, but all those Sunnys hawking a sale tomorrow kind of negate the argument.
---
Whats non-PA power armor?
---
Haha
---
those vids are made before patch 22.  
---
concentrated fire rank 3 was bugged and your vats jumped up to 95. now it works as intended (sadly) and every hit adds 4% hit chance with automatic rifles.   
---
best chance to increase your chance is a weapon with 33% higher hit chance in vats major legendary effect. also, remember to remove concentrated fire rank 3 from your build, its useless now. rank 1 to aim for the head is enough.
---
ooops xD jetpack
---
So that’s what well rested does, nice!
---
The reason I left the game was because of 3 things:
---
1. All the enemies spawned in dead and all of them were turned into mince meat.
---
2. All the enemies that didn't spawn in dead spawned in walls so I couldn't hurt them and they could hurt me.
---
3.every server I logged into when I first started playing had a giant wall denying me a safe exit that someone built and put MK IV  turrets in all around the wall.
---
But I've heard about all the patches and the new content so I'm considering redownloading it.
---
Same and agree
---
Sorry, didnt make it clear: I dont suggest a 100% scrap but something like 50-75% seems fair.
---
Sometimes you are being forced by the game to change your build (nerfs, buffs etc)
---
Not completely. A game isn't a true game without it's glitches. I'm just talking about the really mild ones like where the enemies spawned in the walls and I couldn't hurt them but they could hurt me.
---
Yes. It did. And for two years end game level players ran around one shotting everything, bored, with little to do. 
---
Catering only to casual players isn't good for the game. Nor is catering only go end game players. 
---
This patch does neither.  It has not become inaccessible for new players, and it makes things a bit tougher for end game players. 
---
Bonus for new players, they don't encounter way scaled up enemies in lower level areas like they used to.
---
I can solo them on elder but I tend to wait 5 mins for people to pop in.
---
So where does this knowledge of South Korean schools come from then?
---
And specifically why is this relevant to your statement that free education always leads to lower standards for education?
---
I mean Fallout 4 modders have done it...
---
More like people need to stop overpaying for every new item in the game.
---
yeah the chainsaw got nuked with one wasteland
---
I don’t think they made it like this.  I suspect that your camp location and camp are tied to your character...  not a persistent server.   Otherwise you would always load to the same server every time.  
---
I suspect this would require a whole new service of determining which servers you can load to, think a mapping of all camps (and to whom they belong) and then which players Are currently loaded to which servers.   Then you could have your API call.  But even then it would have edge cases where two people are loading to the same server and their camps overlap.  This probably isn’t a high priority for the makers because this seems like it would be more effort than the quality of life update would bring value.  Like -  how are they gonna make money from this change?  And people don’t quit the game because of this inconvenience. 
---
I’m not a game maker, was a coder for over a decade..  I’m just voicing my suspicions.
---
Are you preparing for the magic weapon fixes or?
---
Thanks! Will max out right cards.
---
My reaction was the same. I tried to get close to see it and figure it out but that did not work out to well 😅🤣😂 found that one the hardest OP but the coolest boss.
---
But isnt just upgrading them to the max enough work? To fully upgrade all 6 you need to level up 600x. That seems plenty to deserve its attribute "legendary"
---
You have to see it to believe it
---
This is irritating.
---
I was on a team where there was supposed to be 5 of us ripping Earl a new arse hole.
---
Reality though was that there was just me and another player wasting ammo against this Bullet Sponge.
---
Even though it was showing 5. on the team.
---
I wouldn't have bothered with the event had i known this and saved my ammunition.
---
Why do players do this ?.Do they get the rewards of the other players without contributing, i would like to know.
---
Speed demon appears to work in PA.
---
There was a really old bug that let you run faster if you were looking at your feet while running. 
---
That's my next test.
---
Yeah but you would first need to craft the drink in order to go out and test it, which requires you to have already acquired one sack. Then to go out and kill another while under the Influence of the drink. So it's not easy really.
---
You would report back to big then get the recipe, or perhaps you wouldn't get the recipe? And instead you have to test it multiple times first? Biv would craft the drink for you when you take a sack to him, and then after X amount of tests you gain the ability to craft it yourself.
---
It's already removed
---
Thanks. Will try to get instigating gun.
---
Oh yeah, that'll do some silly damage with the fire rate and the magic effect aha. I've seen Auto rifles in action but that thing would be a spectacle to behold
---
I just leveled a character with nothing but pipe pistols (32,308,45 rounds) to level 40. All i gotta say is....git gud.
---
No i didn't receive ANY help from anyone or give myself stuff, all legit.

Cloaking blood raiders. They were invisible.
---
Edit boss was grenade launcher. Not too sure got killed pretty quick.
---
I managed to score 2 plans with a 6 min run through the Valley Galleria today, there's a tiny chance at a rare drop at the lower grade, 5%, a much better chance at mid level, 40%, and a pretty good chance at top level, 80%. So, even though the top level is more likely you'll score a plan, it doesn't guarantee a drop all the time. The chances don't stack, so there's a possibility both the plans came from the two lower.levels and I missed out at the top level.
---
That's what i'm saying. i even made a fucking post about it just the other day.
---
That does sound better. Didn't consider gathering the ingredients first which would require you to kill it at least once. And that would make the beverage related to the event also be related to where you get beverages from in the first place. I agree, your idea is better
---
It's stupid it's not like Fallout 4 and the games before it.  There's nothing harmful about them dropping what they use.
---
That's rough buddy.
---
Yes, if you are using vats most of the time. Other perks in perception are made towards non-vats use and ground pounder doesn't work with non-automatics.
---
Yes I did this few weeks ago with a kid taunting me, I killed him and he came back full force with an explo gat plasma and trashed the Place. I killed him again, repaired everything and left
---
Crit savvy 100%. It's not even a contest.
---
Lets say that each shot fills your crit meter 20% and you start with an empty meter. When you compare nothing, four leaf and crit savvy...
---
After 100 shots:
---
* Normal - 20 crits (1 crit per 5 shots)
---
* Four leaf - 25 crits (7 x 4L crits, avg case \[7\] + remaining 93 shot as normal \[18\])
---
* Crit savvy - 32 crits (5 normal shots \[1\] + 95 shots w/ meter reset to 55% i.e 3 shots/crit \[31\])
---
You basically would need for Four Leaf Clover to trigger with double efficiency to just match Crit Savvy.
---
No offense, but they added daily ops for ammo you should try it sometime
---
*Laughs in berry mentats*
---
Sounds like its working as intended.
---
I'm pretty sure it was that way on the PTS and people complained that there was no point for veteran players to one wasteland since half the map was still low level. I think OPs idea is closer to what they need to do, but they should take it farther. High level players get variety in their combat because of enemy level caps, but low level players don't. This makes the mid game 20-40 really difficult because you likely don't have a build and can't farm good equipment. This means a level 30 enemy to a level 30 player is really tough. You need to have a variety of hard and easy enemies for a game to feel balanced. 
---
If they made certain enemies always be a number of levels below or even above your level, then put realistic level caps in so that a radroach would never be higher than say level 20, it would go a long way toward balancing the game. Then low level players could farm certain enemies like wolves while still facing a challenge with harder ones like super mutants. They could even change this algorithm to vary by region so that a mole miner in the ash heap would be easier than one in the savage divide.
---
The scout masks no longer drop from Enclave events, neither are they available from MODUS anymore. Anyone who tells you this is spreading woefully outdated information.
---
The only way to get them these days is in a bundle with the Whitesprings jumpsuit and some other outfits, which has a 0.15% chance to drop from all Messenger events and all events in the Savage Divide, i.e. Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Guided Meditation, etc.
---
Most enemies doesn't drop what they have. Like 99% of the time i see Scorched with Sledgehammer and after killing him he drops Bowie Knife. That's just sad.
---
Make it optional
---
Also ammo factory feels almost useless because of it.
---
Same here , also with the fancy shotgun.
---
Hmmm gonna make a ticked
---
Another beginner who thinks the server is sacred and untouchable, or that the server actually considers whether or not a weapon is actually possible before calculating it's damage.  Go trade some random high level players on PC, look in their inventory and see something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/vLceT8M.png).  This shit is all over the place.
---
i have a house built on a pond, so that its a pool house 
---
when it rains there is water on the floor next to the pool area looks really trippie but ya immersion breaking
---
Unfortunately not. Only other way is to use a trusted friend as a go between.
---
*TF2 Heavy laughing in background*
---
Well the mod actually looks ok actually. Reload speed looks good aswell.
---
It doesn't look like much of an improvement over 1 pistol though, just seems to fire twice as much ammo. But then again this is a mod, so Maybe if it were in the game officially it might be better.
---
I think if it were to be added, the ability to fire while aim would need to go though, and instead allow each trigger to fire the adjacent gun.
---
a % could be more possible.
---
Is fun to play if you have fun playing it
---
If they want to get rid of shit that makes people crash they would remove all explosive energy weapons and all stacking visual effects like strangleheart power armour
---
I haven't crashed at a queen fight since strangleheart was nerfed into oblivion and I'm glad the usage of explosive energy weapons has plummeted at queen fights not sure why it has but I'm certainly not complaining
---
The game can't handle explosions, you'd think they'd make the explosions take less to render as a smart fix but apparently not
---
I never take my build too seriously, but I have that same B2525 fixer with all the commando perks and my shotgun works so much better after one wasteland.  It’s barely a good one (instigating pump) and I only have the enforcer perk on.  My fixer is gonna have to converted to a ranged weapon instead of my do everything.   Im gonna end up switching all my unyielding stuff for vanguard or bolstering.
---
I took a month off and reinstalled 76 with the new update on Friday. I was running around Vault 94 shooting exploding Blood Eagles. Then it crashed. It's better, but there's probably no cure for what ails it. It's still a big ambitious yet lazy game that is still somehow darker, funnier, more immersive and entertaining than other online games that function.
---
I’m not going to disagree on that. Saved my butt on getting elder rank on the burning mine daily op.
---
1. Still happens. 
---
2. Still happens. 
---
3. Idk what this is so I can't say it happens or not
---
Maybe it would be an easy call.  If so,  why haven’t they done it?  Assuming they are An agile shop typically they throw easy shit into a sprint it can fit.   I think again, order of operations.  Your camp is tied to your character.  Your camp was attacked because your camp loaded before your character was placed in the world, but not before the character data was fetched.  
---
There’s also the possibility that there’s errors for the base the load in general.  Often when my camp doesn’t load, I don’t see a conflicting base - and don’t really understand why it didn’t load.
---
The whole dynamic server is what makes this a pain in the ass for the programmers.  That’s my guess.
---
Even at lvl 20 the thing absolutely shreds when leveling up at least
---
Yes, agree
---
Oooooohhhhh Daaaaaaammmn!  Cool of you to repair it.  Was it expensive?
---
Maybe we need both - new mutation and a legendary perk. “4-handed mutation” - for faster reload, and “Yipikaye” for dual-wielding pistols
---
I started with my 50 cal mass producing and burning through ammo.
---
Swapped to my plasma caster which had about 200 ultracite rounds spare. Daily Ops have me around 3000 now.
---
I just think Biv and other characters should act like wizards, that we visit in order to get help and knowledge from, rather than adding things to an RNG loot pool.
---
I see why then do it this way, saves paying voice actors and devs to make it all work. But I'd love if there was more integration between factions, quests and characters.
---
Wait you only get 10 per body??? I get like 40 per body and like 300 off the boss and like 500 after the event anti armour gatling gun is god
---
Meanwhile my .50cal I get like 4-20 bullets per enemy and probably only break even after the event
---
Balancing weapons was the reason they did the damage modifier change.
---
As for your comment of builds than TSE and Bloodied being viable, eh, everything's viable. TSE and bloodied are OP more than other builds not being viable.
---
Bring a shotgun, take the enforcer perk, blow their legs off and have a clever one liner ready for when you walk over and shoot them in the back of the head.
---
Yeah it's devastating as a CAMP enthusiast :(
---
Im GLAD someone blitzed to the finish line- I got to see all the items up close at their house which was kinda cool.
---
I said A lower level area, as in singular.
---
I don't know about things being consistently lower than your level up until 50. I do agree with you that it makes sense that some creatures naturally max out at a certain level or have a level minimum a la scorchbeasts.
---
Yup i tested this the other day, why is this even a thing?
---
Chainsaw, drill, ripper and mr handy buzzblade need some love.
---

I would love to see BIVs basement populated with some Hunter S. Thomson like guys drinking hard liquor and shooting guns.
---
Git gud is the crappest phrase in gaming, and I cannot wait until it goes away.
---
I think it spawns you at the closest named location.
---
It hasn't gone away because it's still funny. 
---
Also it's literally the only thing you say to people who "constantly die".
---
He didn't even try to post his build or ask for help. He's just bitchin.
---
Yeah I am getting the same, only way I have found to make it stop temporarily is to get into and stay in power armour. Though I am aware that doesn't help most builds so...
---
And the train car
---
Totally agree with you. I am using a Vamp LMG and it's shreds.so many people get hung up on having OP builds which are just not needed.
---
No, no it's really not.
---
Yes you are alone. 
---
/s
---
If they are killing you that fast you may need to rethink your armor and perks.
---
When you see the enemies, what level are they?
---
We do but it's just not a priority for Bethesda. They made it clear during a Massively OP interview.
---
I just don't see us getting it ever. It's been 2 years and they're still "discussing it".
---
I haven't really had to go out of my way to find the nuke codes yet, but I do have a rather large camp that allows me to get right up in mele range with they happen to buzz my roof.
---
I tried chasing down the line daily one once, man that  bugger out up a good chaser. Really showed the value of of speed demon, action girl,  and marathoner.
---
A Cryolator is another good weapon for when their trying to encircle you to slow the card holder down long enough to swap weapons and cripple its thrusters.
---
Just remember to not let them die right above you.
---
Had my camp eaten up more than a couple times from crashed vertibirds. Died a couple from inopportune explosions too. XD
---
I like you : )
---
You're lucky, all I got from that event are 6 nuclear waste. :(
---
That's a matter of opinion, friend.
---
Formula P helps too
---
Edit: Sorry I meant Orange Mentats 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Sorry i did not mention that we were in my camp lol so I just repaired everything but did not pay attention to the amount of resources used, maybe someone has more info
---
Bloodied needs a rework in all seriousness.
---
-edit: this coming from a bloodied heavy gunner/stealth commando user
---
I like being able to aim down the sights with pistols though. Would there be a good way of making that work with two pistols, or would it have to be a choice of either using one pistol and being able to aim, or using two pistols and not being able to aim at all?
---
Well get gut then and it will go away
---
Freddy fears usually spawns one amongst the ghouls
---
I agree explosive weapons need work but simply buff demo expert would push the explosive legendary effect ahead of others again.
---
I am a masochist. I call it the masochist build.
---
Pipe pistols with wood and leather armor only.(wood armor has sneak bonus) Having intelligence earlier on and getting perks like fix it good and weapon artisan is very useful. Don't have to worry about breaking down so easily.
---
Also in low level areas like forest there is a lot of scorch for you to pick up ammo off of for your pipe weapons. Just gotta make better decisions with your leveling experience.
---
I'm level 13 and they are level 13. I barley have any perks as I'm only 13
---
2 years only couldn't place my camp once and that was about 2 weeks after release.
---
Todd himself said it is intended to be able to be soloed apart from some endgame events.
---
I run scavenger, with just martial artist, incisor and sneak with an Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet for damage. I'll admit to using a magic shotgun in daily ops, but otherwise I can get about just fine.
---
Though i do still think they should have caped the forest, and maybe Ash heap and a toxic valley lower for the casual gamers. It's tough as heck for those not interested in running optimized builds atm.
---
That’s why I suggest a buff all-around maybe a rework is needed to explosives as well
---
I tested a Two Shot Pipe Revolver yesterday, and it one-shots mutants (I'm level 437)
---
So you *could* get a rare item every &amp; any time you do a Ops?
---
Yeah that make sense. Probably gonna have to do just that.
---
Change your build. Not one RPG game can you go away for a few nonths/ patches and not expect to have to adapt when you come back.
---
Go on YouTube and watch a few videos on  builds after patch 22.
---
And dying every half hour or so is not bad and is not worth a whinge on Reddit.
---
Wtf kind of monster would want the removal of thirst and hunger? That's ridiculous. Thirst and hunger meters are an integral part of fallout and other survival games. If anything they should make the penalty for not eating and drinking worse.
---
*Sigh.*
---
Care to trade one of them? Ask me what you're after and I'll see what I can offer (I have plenty of stuff, weapons, armor, rare plans, etc...
---
Been saying this for a while, it would make sense if pistols were on similar level as heavy weapons since there is 2 shooting and not 1 peashooter. Just makes more sense overall and would make choices for your build more interesting if you can mix and match pistols and other weapons.
---
Sure u can sell in your vendor 😁
---
Yeah, I get it's a big game with a lot of moving parts but sometimes it feels like amateur hour with Bethesda.
---
I'll give the cryolator a go. Can't hurt to try at this point.
---
It's a faction with a lot of cosmetic content, so I hope they will add a quest line and a corresponding ally.
---
Wait, what? How?
---
nope, as far as i know nothing reduces jetpack drain.
---
If you do events you can get legendary items that are your level. All legendaries are scaled, so you won't get level 50 legendary if your 20, and vice versa.
---
Another thing you can do is to make better weapon choices such as use weapons that will drop off your enemies, i used pipe pistosl and killed lots of scorched and i was always rolling in ammo. 
---
When you are lower level you shouldn't be expecting to be using your favorite weapons all the time.
---
Now that I got hack and slash maxed out been using it on the Scorchbeast Queen. I have to get right up in the folds of her anus to make contact in vats.
---
I'm seeing lots of explosions going off but I'm missing the fireworks with my face clipping through her gut. 
---
I'm not sure how much more effective Hack and Slash has made me in that fight.  I'm not getting downed by her minions anymore so I'm guessing they got blown away by the sick beats I belted out on her belly.
---
Second Oooooh Daaaaamn!  Lol
---
Yes it is, that’s why they are helping out.
---
You can actually get 3 on your first attempt is your super lucky and get elder on first shot
---
If you choose to replace a legendary perk it costs 1 perk coin. You don't get back the coins used leveling up your card though. However, if you choose to bring back your original legendary perk it will be at the same level you had it at. Consider it banked, rather than discarded.
---
I mean it does still say it's locked before you open it. You just have to pay attention before barging into someone's camp/collectron/resource miner.
---
Yes, exactly. Then my pirate character can finally weild sword and pistol! Would be an awesome improvement.
---
We finally have a use for Earl's sack, we need to insert it into ourselves, lol 😆
---
I also like it for craft 13 nukes for my junkies mirv launcher, then i end up getting 26 instead. Thank god for ordinance express.
---
...how!?
---
Scorched using Multi-Purpose Axe
---
Kill Scorched
---

---
hmm
---
I also suffer from that cavemans that idle in ops teams... 
---
Easy solution... just implement autokick on everybody who did not play ops for 2-5 minutes. 
---
Now you will only find Ops teams that play ops... and fullfill the reason you can create an ops team.
---
Usually I use a fixer to wing them when their too far, and my gauss shotgun when their close enough.
---
If I see a second players going for them I swap to the Cryolator to lay down some CC.
---
Been wondering why I've seen so many squads fly over my camp tho. Sometimes have gone months without seeing them, only to later have them show up 3 times in a day for weeks.
---
Most times I can down them, sometimes their dead set on getting somewhere else and ignore me completely no matter how many shots I get off.
---
Got nail the lil one to rile them all up I guess.
---
They are still sitting in my stash.
---
If anything, you can always switch to melee with PA. Easy Power Armor can be obtained near Mama Dolce's Food Processing or in WV Lumber Co. Fusion Cores from Poseidon Energy Plant and you are good to go.
---
The legendary perk cards were made more so for the people who have been playing since the beta. At least that's how I feel about them anyways. Not sure what level the OP is but im 240 and was able to max 2 cars right from the get go and they're the ones I know im going to keep equipped at all times. 
---
The ammo one, and the energy one that can charge fusion cores. (I'm a power armor build)
---
You can do that? Interesting.
---
if they can't fix mischief night in a year, you really think they can make an *entirely new event* in a month or two?
---
Doubt.
---
~~Sorry but... your picture is a hoax too. I saw it on reddit some times ago, and it can't exist: the legendary effects and their name are not in the game data. Also, even if it's was true (which is not) you wouldn't not be able to see this yourself in another player inventory, because your game does not have the data to show this to you.~~
---
~~So, speaking of beginner: don't trust what you can't verify yourself.~~
---
Isnt big irradiated spider called cave criccet or something idk I dont have english version of f76
---
How to kill a big nasty mirelurk queen:
---
1. Shoot her acid sprayers right off her gross bug face.
---
2. Blow her legs off.
---
3. Leisurely kill her from a distance.
---
Watch out for those level 50 hatchlings tho. They are gonna be SO angry that you killed their mom.
---
Do you want me to borrow it and show you it?  I can.  
---
Edit:  I got it.  I'm gonna make a video, and I can show you in game on PC if you want to see.  Stand by for footage.
---
What the hecc is Nan PA jetpack???
---
non magic shotguns can still be great if you focus on vats,
---
if you use the luck perk "four leaf clover" every hit has a chance to refill your critical meter
---
every single pellet of your shotgun has a chance to proc this effect meanint that you can use a critical, shot a normal shot in vats and almost allwways have your critical meter full again
---
basically every second shot is a critical
---
i recently made a shotgunner build that uses an anti armor combat shotgun with better vats crits
---
the build need one to two shots to take down level 100 super mutants, if you start with a vats crit you can one shot it
---
i didnt even use stealth wich would make it even more effective
---
the anti armor combat shotgun even works reasonably well out of vats taking down high level ghouls and super mutants in a few shots
---
also the enforcer perk gives shotguns a lot of utility when it comes to boss type enemies where you can force scorched beasts to land or make sheepsquatches unable to move
---
A while back I saw someone suggest some horribly mutated amalgam of Mole Miners and Mole Rats as a boss for the ash heap, I pictured something like Gurdy from The Binding of Isaac which would be equally cool and terrifying.
---
you need a Secret Service chest armor
---
Pacifist mode.
---
How are the gauss pistols? Been thinking about those.
---
Why are you sighing?
---
He's right. 
---
His problems would go away if he got good at the game and made better choices.
---
I take it you're unaware of the level 15 crossbow that holds way more ammo than possible and has like 5 times the range and still displays its damage as normal but 1 shot kills everything
---
That's just 1 of the "broken" low level weapons in the game there is also the 1 shot kill anything dragon black powder rifle with 700 range
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Since some Catfish can produce electricity, that would play out perfectly for a power plant boss! Play into Thunder mountain and give it some Thunder and Lightning abilities (something like the colossus' fear inducing roar but with a stun?)
---
I had to hop servers 4 times to get my camp placed the other day. So I said I'm nuking the 3rd one but it was a nice camp with good vendor items so I said whatever I stole my first camp position from someone else I saw soooo......
---
I guess it might have been one of those about the presence of microtransactions in multiplayer Cyberpunk. Which was actually already implied by an [interview from early November 2017](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-to-contain-online-elements). But that was followed very shortly by the huge controversy around Star Wars Battlefront 2, and CDPR responded quickly with their "we leave greed to others" campaign, so the above mentioned interview was kind of forgotten about by the gaming community.
---
I think CDPR always carefully avoided promising that there would be no microtransactions in their future multiplayer games, but now that they are confirmed in Cyberpunk's online spin-off, many people are surprised and disappointed. Nevertheless, I doubt the status of the company has really been burnt so far, they could actually be in a very good position with 2077 for the next year or so. It might get worse though once the multiplayer game is finally released in a couple years, especially if there are issues (which is common for an online title) at launch, and with the wait for the next Witcher starting to feel long.
---
I prefer the thrill of roaming in open PVP.
---
Very nice! I got a 7:33 today, its fun to grind it solo
---
I should send this to Steve (shgames) dude always got his panties in a bunch about something. 😂😂
---
This was true until a couple patches ago. Now you're more likely to get a glowing one. The wendigo does still spawn on occasion though.
---
Not generally.  Although a lot of parents will take the day, or half day off of work to get their kids ready for trick or treat.
---
I'm out in the country now, but when I lived in town I would get 50 kids at minimum to my door.  It's a great little community activity.
---
We'd hand out candy to the neighbor kids, and we'd have friends over and have a get together for our adult friends at the same time.
---
Halloween is fun, but you have to be somewhere that a lot of people are participating for it to be fun.
---
and that show their game dies. The snobs log in one day and start seeing empty servers.
---
Huh. I'm playing through a character at level 15 and while it is more challenging than it was prior to the patch, it's not THAT much harder. 
---
The hardest part is keeping up with ammo and if you're smart about it, it's really a non-issue. It's what you should be doing at lower levels but just more of it.
---
I don't really know what you're doing now but it sounds like you're treating the game like a run and gun shooter and not a tactical shooter with heavy resource management mechanics.
---
Obvious stuff to do:
---
* Setup combat in such a way that you're only dealing with 1-2 at a time. 
---
   * If it gets any more than that, retreat and either reengage when the total numbers drop or setup an ambush. Really basic shit like if you're being engaged by 4 enemies at once and it's too much, retreat around a corner, wait for the first 1-2 enemies to swing around and suddenly a 1v4 becomes 2 sets of 1v2 or 4 sets of 1v1.
---
* Have different weapons for different occasions i.e. at least 1 ranged weapon for high threat (highest damage), 1 ranged for general use and 1 melee weapon for general use or trash mobs to conserve ammo.
---
   * Don't be fixed minded in thinking I'm a sniper build so I only use a sniper weapon. You shouldn't even think about specialising until at least past levels 20-30. Use what you have and what's appropriate for the situation.
---
* Constantly scrap all weapons you pickup (especially ranged ones) to learn mods and upgrade weapons asap.
---
   * Same applies to armour but to a lesser extent
---
* Get a PA frame (or seek out raider PA when you're level 15+) and use it during heavy combat situations where you can't use the above tactics. 
---
   * The frame itself is likely more armour than any armour you can get/make at that level but conserve it as FCs are harder to get at low levels
---
* Make full use of chem and food buffs like hotkey damage chems like psycho/psychobuff/psychotats during tough battles
---
That's far from comprehensive but it should be plenty to get you started.
---
I just about always have a wendigo and a glowing one, though I haven't played since the newest patch
---
I completely understand you, I died a lot doing the final part of "mayor for a day" and the worst part was I had to go all my way up again to the roof from the streets.  I ended up finishing the mission while hiding in dark spot away from those bloody colonel gutsys. XD
---
By modding it. 🤷🏻‍♀️ https://imgur.com/gallery/6ONPsIn
---
Yeah. It's still bugged
---
Sometimes the weapon drops on the ground beside them rather than going into their inventory. Not always, mind.
---
In this level you need a strategy for everything. The easiest thing is always have a shotgun, a two hands meele weapon, and a non-automatic scoped rifle (or pistol). Ammo is limited, but you can use the meele weapon for kill everything even in one wasteland if you stay in the Forest.
---
Of course, you need a prepare a build. And find how the game is more enjoyable for you. You don't need a optimized build. Just pick a weapon and choose perks accordingly to a strategy, like high mobility or high endurance or use power armor or stealth. Use https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks for plan your build.

That won't mess it up..  You can complete it at each level once per day.  As long as you don't get Elder on the 1st try.
---
Much appreciated buddy
---
No.
---
Had this problem last night.  Joined a team as the 4th member and everybody not doing shit.  I finally just started it hoping they would get the hint.
---
Scroll through the stashes. It's on the same line as the standard stash.
---
sadly no.
---
But Honey does ;)
---
This is the correct answer. You can finish or fail as many times as you like. You can only get each rank of prize once. So if you get the the third rank only, you'll get that prize. Then dust yourself off, grab some stimpacks, get back in there and get Elder for the top prize.
---
The thing is that I want to finish it in the first try on elder for the rare reward, that is why i want to make the dummy runs first to see the locations and not finish it, so I can finish it directly on elder with the daily rare reward
---
Always one in fort defiance too.
---
I'm guessing that weapon is lost?
---
He is a random encounter and regularly makes pilgrimages to Fissure site Prime!
---
&gt;would it have to be a choice of either using one pistol and being able to aim, or using two pistols and not being able to aim at all?
---
It could be implemented to aim both pistols alternately. My assumption would be you would not fire poth pistols simultaneously but one at a time. While contiuing to hold holding down the aim button, pistol 1 would aim, press trigger to fire, then pistol 2 would automatically fall into aim and press trigger to fire again. Actual gunslingers do this, bringing each pistol to aim position before firing, alternating between pistols. I have seen this in other games, it is possible but since this is Bethesda we're talking about, it feels unlikely.
---
I have been a heavy gunner my whole time. And I like it. Mainly because it is fun but yes crafting ammo for them is way easier. You throw a lot of let down range. Since I was level 50 I had no trouble completing West Tech or really anything. And with the legendary ammo Factory perk I am to the next level now with the ammo. 50 cal is the best in my opinion. But now with the legendary perk the minigun is back in play. 50 cal is best in my opinion because there is no wind of time, the ammo is cheap in the damage is good.
---
Not that I've noticed, i seem to just get random energy ammo.
---
Yes. As a vampire's heavy gunner i love my Minigun. i also am armed with 
---
Gatling Plasma, Gatling Laser, Gauss Minigun, .50 Cal, Flamer, LMG, Plasma Caster
---
IMO the Broadsider is kinda trash, Missile launcher and Fatman are too weak for their ammo weight, and auto grenade could be fun.. with the right roll
---
This is probably one of the better arguments Ive heard on this situation.  I don’t feel the same level of pain as you do, as I’ve spent less time and effort on my character as many people have.  I think the lack of certainty is the worst thing about it all.  A few days ago I read a thread that listed all of the broken or bugged perk cards.  Just knowing that ~10% of the perks offered either simply don’t work (or do far less than is advertised) BEFORE the One Appalachia patch was released just begs the question - what’s broken now?  If everything had been hunky dory beforehand, and the patch was released with a decent level of documentation associated with it, at least we would be able to study and recalibrate.  As it is, we’re just shooting in the dark, as it were.
---
The dang train car.  Any pre-build building should allow this.
---
I can talk about heavy guns all day LOL. So if you want to get into heavy guns really the stabilized perk and power armor are necessary. So if you don't like power armor I don't know. But stabilized cuts 45% of enemies armor. So if you use an anti-armor gun it's great. The final word is a very good gun to get for free
---
Killing the end boss with a gatling plasma will give you plasma cores as a reward for the op. 
---
I was jumping for joy when I saw the first post about this. I dusted of my VFFR GP with glee.....
---
That is what I normally do as well.  From my understanding, you have a chance at a rare reward at each level.  Elder just has the best (80%) chance of giving one.  
---
I always finish a couple of solo runs in over 8 minutes.  Then switch to a public team fir my Elder run and still get the rare rewards on my Elder run.
---
Well this, or I spawn into a wall at my camp. So awesome.
---
I think one of the reasons for this is that they want you to be killing more enemies so they don't want you rolling in loot, it would be a little imbalanced.
---
And auto pistols need a weapon only they can use
---
Nice one, cool
---
I've got a rather large elaborate camp, and while I've never had issues with rain, the lighting is always getting bugged out, theres always this hard edge on like a quarter of the structure where that side of the base is clearly under a slight yet very obvious different lighting condition. 
---
My camps big enough that looking down or up from inside of it tears apart the textures. 
---
Really wish that fully enclosed camps would be more so under night time conditions.  I love the lighting effects at night but my place is so bleached out during the day.
---
Am pretty excited about the green house build. Might contemplate making glass labyrinth at some point. 
---
I wonder if it will have really low durability against enemy attacks.
---
They just kite enemies over to you then steal your stuff!
---
The internet has actual documentaries detailing things about this, if you'd simply at least look for it on Google you'd see it. Where you have videos like these: https://youtu.be/TXswlCa7dug
---
It relates to my statement because it exemplifies the quality change from one phase of education to another; in which once the student transitions into a point where the parent has to pay for their education, the level of dedication expected of the student almost triples as they are almost forced by the standards of society to have to go to college in order to successfully get a job.
---
And the problem with the approach I listed as an example is what is inherently immoral about the industrial education system.  It. Seeks to enslave and cram/shove students with exams as opposed to skills they can apply and use to practice with. It's why I hated that in college I spent more time analyzing and studying circuit analysis techniques more than I did actually working with circuits. The system is outdated, and serves to underprepare students even in a college setting.
---
America can change back to what it used to be. The good old way where if you didn't have the money to go to school, you'd go to your local library armed with the skills to read and write by the time you're 4. Where the only teacher is the origin from which knowledge was first spread to others. At that point the student has complete control of his or her education. 
---
Will Sidis, the person whose life was portrayed by the film Good Will Hunting starring Matt Damon, is exemplary of what happens when you take charge of your own education.
---
[Okay, your move.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qnuQ2IQ528)  Again, I'm happy to show you in-game on PC, but be snappy if you do want to see it, it's a loaner.
---
Damn!  Never seen a scortched Moth Man.
---
I don't think a lot of mines kept gatling guns as standard issue but honestly I'm all for new weapon drop potentials.
---
Personally, I'd rather see drills and chainsaws finally get legendary roll tables, maybe add sledgehammer or ina perfect world a brand new Wendigo themed weapon - like imagine needing those vocal sacks to create some sort of concussive sonic cannon that's good for crippling/staggering maybe even blowback similar to the old Stay Back or Super slam nv perks.
---
Pretty much nailed it. 
---
Every thread about this issue has at least one try hard claiming that all those "food builds need to adapt and overcome" the problems they have. Basically, even those with absolutely valid issues are told to "git gud".
---
This is absurd, you can't "git gud" in a couple of hours or days in a game that hands out gear by RNG. The only guaranteed drop is Final Word, the rest is RNG, and Final Word isn't exactly given to you when you leave the vault. 
---
I think that including the Forest region, which is basically the tutorial area and a nuke free zone anyways, was a mistake. At least for low levels. I'm fine with running into level 50s when I run around in the Forest but I'm close to level 600. I'm a full health PA heavy gunner with AA weaponry. It was easy mode before the patch and it still is. I need a bit more ammo but ammo is a non issue at my level. Pretty much everything is a non issue at my level. I don't have a min/max build but the legendary perks made the game even easier for me.
---
This is NOT true for new players, low levels or casuals who just enjoy exploring the map or camp building. These are the people who, imo, rightfully complain. A one time free respecc option should have been part of the patch. That wouldn't have helped the new or low levels but at least the casual high levels could have made adjustments to their, in parts, screwed builds.
---
valseek said they are taking a look at making it a bit easier for the new and low levels and hotfix it soon, so let's hope that soon actually means soon.
---
I've already lost several people from my friends list who've quit because the game turned from being fun into a chore because they dared using builds that are now useless or perks that have to be ditched in favor of damage.
---
I still enjoy the game. The patch made it even more fun. But dismissing the, imo, valid complaints from low levels and casuals with git gud and "just change your build mate" is insulting and needs to stop.
---
The game, in a perfect scenario, should be fun for all players. It's not Rust or Fortnite. It's not hardcore or a competitve sport.
---
Maybe making camps impossible to be destroyed and the Forest a chill out zone again is a part of the solution but at this point we'll just have to wait and see.
---
Possible that everyone already got max level and not interested in the XP farming, but then they should switch out of group.
---
the only reason is sneak and the accompanying bonusses.
---
50cal for daily ops where you cant sneak anyway is king
---
I had that - was a faulty RMB. Try a different mouse.
---
&gt; remove a hand
---
So that your right hand is holding the right pistol and the left hand is holding the left pistol then all that's needed is for the hands to press the button to drop the ammo and clip two more mags in from your hip. That's how dual wielding works
---
I started out commando til 80. Got bored of dying and sneaking, rolled a 2nd chracter with unarmed - same problem. Rolled a third aiming for power armour and heavy guns and haven't looked back. She's currently... 228 I think? Junkies full health build with vampire weapons for everyday use/oh shit moments. A vampires minigun, even a one star, is virtual immortality for running westek/charlseton building/fissure prime/literally any xp grinding spot
---
Ammo Smith legendary perk means I can now just run around without letting go of the trigger and everything dies except me. 
---
It's very much a playstyle thing, I am quite an aggressive player who relies on armour, vampires effects and stimpacks to stay alive. Stealth just ain't my thing :)
---
If you want a tankier version of the build and plan to run at less than full hp, having extra max hp makes being "low hp" less risky. So then for that I'd recommend [this updated version.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f373b6b&amp;d=sg2eh2a12l71ls2lu2lt2a04ic4ip2id2cm2cu1pe2sq2s22s32sr2x13x03x43a72x53c71xn3xl3ee2&amp;w=ce0cd1&amp;m=c29f&amp;n=End%20Game%20Heavy%20Gunner) Alternatively you can skip the max hp and take ghoulish. The max hp will be better in most situations, but if you're fighting in a nuke zone, ghoulish will constantly heal you. It used to be a really strong perk, but fighting inside nuke zones has all but disappeared. You fight queens and colossus outside of any radiation.
---
Alternatively there are a few other ways to play, but low hp builds just became much better due to mobs getting stronger. I can sit at half hp on my heavy, dish out world ending damage and live through face tanking earl. Though, that is with a vampiric .50 cal.
---
I have all bloodied and junkies weapons on my heavy weapon character. The best all around heavy weapon gun types (imo) are the .50 cal, gatling plasma, gatling gun, laser gatling, and minigun in that order. My junkies explosive minigun is my highest dps weapon, but the .50 cal is the best all around heavy weapon gun in the game imo. 
---
If you can find a bloodied or junkies lvl 50 .50 cal you'll be set for dps. A solid vampiric .50 cal is a nice backup for situations where you know you'll be eating a lot of damage. The gatling gun is a great starter and all around heavy weapon as it doesn't use that much ammo comparatively. It's the hardest hitting full auto heavy per bullet. If you're not high level or have mats flowing out of your ears, I recommend finding a good gatling gun. Mine is just a simple 1* anti armor gatling gun and it can handle anything.
---
Lastly, If you do want to go full HP builds, then Junkies is your best choice and anti armor is #2. Drop adrenal reaction from the mutation list if you do go full hp. If you plan to go energy weapons as a primary, you also might consider putting a few points in batteries included. It's in the Int tree and reduces the weight of plasma cores and fusion cores. I'd recommend sacrificing 2 points in action boy/girl for 2 points in batteries included, assuming you carry around a lot of energy weapons.
---
Turn on pacifist. The perk taking one for the team is bugged.
---
It'll melt the boss in a daily op in like 2-3 seconds of fire.
---
the legendary perk taking one for the team allows people to force you into PVP, even if you do not attack back
---
If you're teamed up with you a friend, you can drop items into a container (such as the cigarette machine in the Rusty Pick), switch to another character, join the same server your friend is on and the items you put in the container will still be there.
---
I've personally never had any issues doing this but I've heard about people's stuff being snatched by other players or just plain disappearing. It's rare but it can happen, so don't go trying to move like 12 3* legendaries or 20000 ammo at once. Start with a junk or aid item to make sure it's working.
---
I have Fallout 1st so I can just do it myself lol
---
No fire mods added to weapons actually work with friendly fire alas.
---
I really wanted the flaming Sheepsquash club and staff to work with it. Alas not...
---
i know this bug, usually going away from enemies helps, i cant exit when in 'caution' but where your sneak says 'hidden' exiting pa is possible
---
Ask him for build help then
---
They are somewhat common in the nuke cloud after the nuke has landed
---
Always wished we could tilt the camera during the sleep animation... for science.
---
You could do it with 3 hands, even.
---
Oh and they already have the perk card image for this on the Strange in Numbers perk!
---
I actually think it could require a quick load mod on both pistols and reloading could just use the holster weapon - draw weapon animation on both guns simultaneously.
---
Can you get legendary quad pistols? I want to dual wield a pair of quad explosive 10 mm SMG's.
---
Wait wait wait... you have an issue with a gatling gun being in a mine but not a weapon traditonally used to hunt whales...?
---
the same best mods for every power armor model. 
---
Calibrated shocks, Jetpack, Targeting Hud
---
You aren't alone in this
---
any chance you do have mutations that decrease your ranged accuracy?
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Only the boss, and its ends up as a quest reward, not obtainable from kills unfortunately, so use a different weapon for farming ammo then kill the boss with your Gatling plasma.
---
got it
---
Thanks and for the arms?
---
He just got it a lot earlier than us fence-sitters did.  I did both the Raider and Settler questlines until the very end, then sided with the Raiders and split the bullion with them, and after weeks of dailies I’m like 75% of the way to Allied with both factions (I had the Settler quest bug where I didn’t actually have to go track down the water-cooled enema machine, so there were days I completed that quest and skipped the Raiders).  The Stealth Armor isn’t my bag (I’d rather have Legendary effects), so it’s been a long time grinding towards something I want to actually buy from either of them.
---
That's not pvp and if you can't handle a couple of enemies you shouldn't be there in the first place.
---
I don’t think it’s as simple as that though. Sure, some are. I dare to bet some are doing it because it makes themselves feel better (comparable to people making donations to make themselves feel good) or just to ditch the weight. 
---
I might be a bit pessimistic here, but I hope you get my point. Not every good deed has the intention of being a good deed.
---
Alright thanks guys
---
Its unreal how many people are claiming they are getting destroyed by them lol
---
Ah no shit.  Thanks for the info.
---
It's a feature. BOS soldiers are blind in their loyalty to saying ad victorium after everything they say while trying to find the plans for a fusion powered toothbrush.
---
The 50 cal is everything the minigun wants to be, super huge clip, crazy high damage, but no spin up. Pretty much nothing stands in the way of my explosive 50 cal, if you can find a solid legendary one it'll change the game for you. For me, the spin up on the minigun is so long it renders it virtually unusable in all but the most intentional of situations. It is also kind of wimpy, particularly when compared to the 50 cal or the LMG. In my opinion.
---
I agree with you grenades need a huge buff, 700 damage doesn't one shot enemies in daily ops or wendigos in colossal problem compared to how much it cost to craft them and how much it weights. Grenade launcher, fatman, rocket launcher and auto grenade deal no damage to SBQ nor earl which is total nonsense because apparently dealing more than two digit damage with a portable nuclear launcher with a slow reload is too op but magic weapons killing bosses under 5 seconds is alright. Also if we're talking about buffs, the single action revolver needs a huge one because i won't change my current trash tier melee build for an even trashier revolver build that deals nothing and take a whole year to reload. The condition system could use a rework and reverting the damage for melee would be sweet too.
---
You get sucker punched while looting by some prick who dragged a mirelurk king over to the tent! If I'm fighting yes I can handle it, but not while I'm in a menu!
---
There is a difference between making end game content and making all content endgame. I can see the value in having to stay frosty, at the same time a mob of boatflies or mole rats should not be treated the same was a scorchbeast should. I think my endgame god roll should one shot any boatfly, mongrel, radstag, molerat, bloodbug, radtoad, you know riff raff. Ain’t nobody got time for that.
---
this. but pacifist wont help in every situation because its bugged as well. be careful and dont afk while standing in your camp to be on the safe side
---
If you like ammo, don't try the gauss mini.
---
it's a good gun, just eats through ammo, and the amount you get per craft is pitiful.
---
Use a cheaty mechanic, great advice.
---
Nothing. they are all garbage unless you are melee
---
Good point, I honestly didn’t have much faith in them saving the camp after loading in due to the fact they can’t even make the blueprints work properly, lesson learnt I guess.
---
I've seen 3 there from about 40 to 50 queen kills
---
That's still on you. Pay fucking attention.
---
I'm pretty sure it will have eventually, but this stuff all takes time, sadly.
---
Powwhackbang if your looking for people to do shit with.  I wont kick you either lol.  Goes for anybody who sees this.  With the new update group play is much better.  Your level doesnt matter to me.  Im 117 give or take.  Zero problems helping low level players.
---
Haha that's an interesting way to look at it, nice one.
---
I've also seen people using nuke mines to down bloodied players after the event.
---
Fixing all the hacked and magic weapons would solve a lot of issues with PC. They need to change the way event rewards work so they are based on activity and not just mowing things down. Uranium Fever has always been a prime example of that before One Wasteland. Make it to where if you do objectives you get the drops just like plenty of other games do.
---
I haven't gotten that one in months...
---
I logged in last night and was getting a buttery smooth 80fps (at least that's what my screen said) while exploring even in the mire. I joined ACP and didn't experience a single slow down but then I joined OVN and was at like 17fps at one point xD
---
I use melee
---
I always change the group goal to casual immediately afterwards.
---
Egg sacks hanging around spawning dozens of mini spiders ala Mirelurk eggs and Queen...uh, I’ll pass, thanks.
---
Wasn’t there a FO with spiders in it?  I know FO3 had buttloads of ants.  I’m probably thinking of Elder Scrolls.
---
Does it not?
---
I need that train set in my CAMP &lt;3
---
I honestly never even thought about looking.  I will for now though.  Just want to kill one to say I did it lol.
---
Thats some funny shit.
---
Carrying a lot of junk because it weights less in your inventory than in your stashbox, something only non F1st will ever feel. :( haha
---
then you would like Optimized Bracers
---
Really dig the new tune, much more of a spooky song. Goes great with my Silent Hill styled camp.
---
For ops you want high damage low rate of fire weapons, otherwise you waste more ammo than you expend!
---
There are some exploits that can bypass pacifist too. So be careful, do not afk at camps.
---
I can't speak for PS4, but on PC photos are stored on your hard drive.
---
Fuck them gutsies.
---
Yeah, there's even a perk that increases the damage done to workshop/camp items.
---
Wish they would add more mutated wild life to the game in general.  Anything native to Appalachia would be an improvement.
---
Well the greenhouse will let the water in unless it's fixed. Kinda shit as whys it set up different than any of the other build types ya know?
---
I would love dual wielding to be added. But also feel it shouldnt be the only means to make pistols more viable. 
---
Id like to see higher weakspot multipliers for handguns. I.e) pistols now do 3x headhshot damage and non Supressable revolvers do 4x (due to lack of stealth)
---
Normal ones don't drop either, it randomizes the ammo!
---
Yeah i get that, i mean it used to be a lot bigger here years ago when i was growing up, but it just kinda died off, ive lived in my house 2 years now and i dont think ive had a conversation with my next door neighbor let alone anyone else nearby
---
Luckily they are stored in library on PS4 as well. 
---
But I don’t think it’s possible to get them into the game again sadly. 
---
Which is why I now have the standard loading screens. Which sucks lol.
---
I think they even lengthened that skirt a bit, I had a screenshot where the skirt was above the knees but now it's below the knees.
---
Your feeling is correct. In fact, fuck them.
---
Overpowered meta builds are kind of required after one wasteland nerfing everything.
---
.o   .
---
Is on the ghoul side, am pretty sure it respawns when you enter fresh. Usually is in range of the room with the power switch. Which usually is already pulled when I go to do my red nurse outfit run.
---
And that's the problem.
---
Casual players are this game's lifeblood. One Wasteland locked them out.
---
New bug, who dis. You haven't run into the latest feature then. You can get someone into PvP even if they have pacifist on.
---
Gather around children.... Bask in the holy glow of his light. We need more mothman related quests to show our loyalty to his infernal majesty of stalking and neurotoxic death!
---
Are we even going to get one? Seems like they don’t want to let us have x2 or even x3 XP with this Seasons thing.
---
Yup I've been saying this since the PTS but everyone in this subreddit kept down voting me insisting it would do the opposite dispite what the numbers and the video footage said!
---
Im dying more because I was so used to 2 tapping everything.  Not the case anymore.  I cant just run into a group of mobs and clean house.  Love the update but I can understand where low level people are coming from.
---
If it was aid or misc it couldn't be stored in scrap boxes anymore. Plenty of people who would take issue with that (I've got 1k flux on hand, and know some have over 7k).
---
How?
---
Only do it with crafted weapons then.
---
It kills me.  I am hoping the will adjust at some point to make it more like 5mm or .50.
---
That was patched out
---
I’m not bothered by too many things in the Fallout universe, but when I first came across a little flock of Cazadores in FONV, I was reminded that I was terrified of dragonflies when I was a little boy as they stung me into poisoned oblivion.  These were close enough to dragonflies that I had a nice taste of childhood fear in my mouth as it happened.
---
I was also paralyzed with fear by the Incredible Hulk when I was like, 4, but Super Mutants are actually kind of cute and non-threatening to me in the Fallout universe.
---
I had to switch to a prime receiver for it just so i could craft more ammo at a time. Now i need to stock up on crimson.
---
Still happening so nope, Bethesda claimed to have patched a lot of things!
---
YES, ffs we're living in 2020 and this mmo has no chat, even skyrim together has a chat, it should be a number one priority, for instance just have some sort of trade chat like who has grognake the barbarian 9 or something because a lot of players have stuffs and don't sell or when you start a colossal problem and you see someone with a good weapon and want to ask what are his legendary effects and the only way to see it to ask to trade which nobody accepts or just like you pointed out in daily ops when you want your team mates to come near the uplinknand they don't understand you doing the follow me emote and shooting at the ground
---
I am capable of looking things up, I am asking you where your information comes from, to understand the value of that information.
---
You said you can write an essay on it,  just curious where you gleaned this information from.
---
That difference between South Korea and the US seems a cultural shift as opposed to a financial difference between the free access to education. My knowledge of South Korea is limited, but as I understand it they, much like the US have public schools that are free through High School, then College or University are paid for or supported by scholarships, loans etc. much in a similar way to the US.  But the differences than the Us are cultural, and teaching positions are more well paid and respected too.
---
Have you looked into the educational model of Finland?
---
Might have to just roleplay it being a rain forest effect from the moisture for now.   :p
---
Least it still functions as a camp structure.  That new super generator wont play nice with anything.  No clue what they expected is to do with it. 
---
Tore up my camps roof trying to fit it in before realizing it was a floor only item, then forcing me to undergo a major overhaul of my camp since it was tore up anyway.
---
You coooould be like me and continue to get elder rank first try, and still not get 1 rare reward since the start of this event
---
Daggers too!!!
---
I had someone get mad at my buddies and I for having a daily-ops group which we turned to public (had all four spots filled) to get the bonus. We ran our runs, then forgot to leave the team after one of our guys hopped off, leaving the space for this one low level to try to join. They tried demanding we run a daily ops, that we "owed" them it for having a public team. We kicked him then left the team, reforming it as a private team.
---
Whatever happens happens.  Im not hoarding coins because something might change.
---
From one run?
---
There's a chance you can find one in the Portside Bar just before the doorway into the kitchen,  and a number of them at Sugar Grove. But remember you can always craft some Vodka yourself via Brewery Station.
---
I would love an extra weight and separate weights from the normal storage and your vendors, displays too, I'm always overcumbered. :(
---
I've played since launch, I had my build dialed in I could one hit any humanoid or smaller creature and when I started one shotting anything larger I dailed it a bit back. I found a good balance, larger enemies were still a bit of a challenge but a ghoul or scorched shouldn't be able to take more than one .50 bullet to the face.  I also did bloodied and found it to OP, how can I complain it's to easy when I made it to easy myself. 
---
" Catering only to casual players isn't good for the game. Nor is catering only go end game players. " In my initial comment I mentioned how we want both, hard and easy areas. Then they cater to both casuals and core players.
---
I don't find any tougher, just more tedious, more grindy.
---
 I for one enjoyed the exhilaration of seeing a level 70 deathclaw on my low level characters.
---
They should give people a respec after this update at least.
---
Proof?
---
Well i guess or just pick up a non legendary weapon up off an enemy of choice like a handmade or whatever have a couple in your stash and your guy will be ready to go
---
Will record it next time it happens to me.
---
Considering that we have never see a whale, outside a carcass, even in FO4 far harbor it's safe to assume this is more of a spear gun/grappler in usage which is a lot closer to items that actually were kept in many mines.  
---
A screwdriver isn't a can opener either but if we see one in a kitchen scene next to a can of dog food you'll probably be able to piece together that usage pretty quickly.
---
Everything at the whitespring bubker? Wich area?
---
Pkup guitars,harmonica.etc..Violin is the only thing I've been able to display
---
Wait till you see lv 100+ ones!
---
Of course you will.
---
I always feel like the pistol should be offhand, that way you have all the finesse of your main hand for your sword,  and can fire the pistol with the other.
---
That haunted house thing up north has a legendary all the time.  Not guaranteed but happens often enough to warrent a check when I log on.
---
I have 3 chars that I've done the ops on everyday. I have 6 vault 94 vaultsuit plans.
---
Make sure you have some ranks of Demolition Expert. My explosive double barrel was doing trash damage to enemies despite having 150+ damage over my Instigating pump action. Put some points into DE and now it's at least close. Probably gonna scrip it or sell it.
---
Bloodied vampire in PA is pretty much unstoppable. With a selection of VFFR and BFFR weapons you will almost never die and bring considerable DPS to any fight.
---
Except Mirelurk kings. Fuck Mirelurk kings. 😁
---
Make sure you screenshot it before you kill it. They look really cool in the nuke zone
---
Yes, as plans in the production wing
---
I fucking wish lol.
---
Why stop here? Give me feral/glowing  ghoul in power armor! Bonus points if Super Mutant could somewhat fit into it as well (or give him even bigger PA).
---
Anyway, I don't think excavator PA can be used by enemies. We are supposed to be the only ones who created it (with plans) and thus were are owners of the first and only Excavator. While Mole Miners could find an access to Excavator plans and modify to their bodies, this seem to be quite stretched, especially since there are other PA's lying around.
---
They could just do the Reaper reload like Overwatch lol
---
Im not sure if Hack and slash counts as an explosion  in terms of demolition expert, and grenadiers, but with a faster swing speed weapon its allowing me to  several mobs in 1 salvo when their in range.
---
I think its doing some magical work in Sckrched Earth but cant tell for sure. Cant see a dam thing when VATs ing the queens gut.
---
But am pretty sure I'm clearing out the bulk of her spawns within seconds of them spawning in.
---
Am at least am not getting killed by them anymore. 
---
Pistols and daggers tho very much need a rebalance to bring them more in line with their DCG esque cousins.
---
I just don't get why they have so many perks afforded to them only to have them put out barely half the damage of the others who only need a handful,  if that.
---
Bethesda like so many companies will out right lie to your face, it's all about the $$$$££££
---
Me personally, the game is 10x better then launch.  If you already own the game give it a whirl.  If you dont like it just delete it.  Nothing lost really.
---
For sure.

I have it. I will have to break it out haven't worn it in a while!
---
Haven't tried them, as the charge-up of all the Gauss weapons puts me off. I've unlocked the minigun and shotgun though
---
Congrats man! I think my closest was like 7:53. Completely changes how you play when you see the clock almost at 8 minutes
---
Yep. Unarmed/1H and pistol!  The bash button being melee attack
---
I hadn't played it in a while only found out the tune had changed when a traveling merchant stopped to use it.
---
I'm on console
---
The perk was always intended.
---
Bethesda said that they are postponing the feature as they couldn't figure out how to implement it in time.
---
We haven't seen a whale because we haven't been under water. There's butt tons (in FO4) of those dolphin like things laying around as if they're fresh catches next to harpoon guns or in places where people are using harpoon guns.
---
The screw driver thing isn't really the same since it's a widely applicable tool, compared to a weapon with a specific use. Also, why in the world would they use harpoon guns for mining at all when places like Garahan are building full-on suits for mining purposes? If we can use a suspension of disbelief for Cursed Harpoon Guns, surely we can do the same for Cursed Gatling Guns
---
Dodgy sadly does not play nice with Hack and Slash, nor medics weapons, nor my magic gauss shotgun.
---
I'm not dieing, no, but its really hampering my VATs game.
---
The changes were announced well in advance.
---
I've read somewhere it usually counts if you have another disease simultaneously and don't cure them with anything at all - an it worked both for me and my friend.
---
So, maybe try this out: next time you'll catch Sludge Lung, eat some spoiled meat or drink dirty water until you catch parasites/dysentery/whatever, don't use antibiotics and stay in game until they both wear off. 
---
Hope it's gonna help.
---
Yeah I don’t know why anyone wants this removed. It’s been part of the franchise forever, it would completely remove the need for cooking stations and recipes and fertilizer and all of the other survival aspects that go into food and beverage production and consumption. I mean if all anybody wants to do is run around and shoot things there are plenty of other games that do just that. And far better than this game does.
---
On paper, no they don't go along, in practice, it's quite nice.
---
You could use ap regen buffs to help keep the AP meter topped off rather than going the reduction route, canned coffee and quantum are great for it. I always keep a few of each on my heavy gunner assigned to the favourites wheel, it helps me make more use of the dodgy perk in a firefight.
---
Probably they do not want to do another run and leave so they make room for people that want to do the runs :)
---
That second part hits oddly close to everyday life nowadays lol
---
Minor legendary effect: Grave robber. Grants the ability to highlight corpses that still contain loot.

---
Does it not what?
---
Isn't Explosive Flamer kinda doing that? I remember some video where player used vats to shot enemy from far and his single projectile (small fire ball) hit and killed enemy.
---
Edit: [Not same but similar video](https://youtu.be/YydkNolstoU?t=763)
---
Im assuming it will be fixed because its part of a new major endgame activity.
---
For reward I get normally 2 o 4 ultracite fusion core, so not from the enemy's body but from the reward
---
I’ve never had this issue. Maybe you need to set the quest as active in your data on your pip boy? I get this with the reputation dailies.
---
Ok you are half way there. Being low life IS still the best option for tanks. And Will always be as long as serendipity exists.
---
Share you build here and ill try to Help you
---
Yeah, I just asked my friend if we should just grind it for a couple of weeks and he said yeah so I'm gonna see how much it's improved since it started
---
So they are making that perk even more useless in the future.
---
Yup, probably planning on nerfing our weapons more too!
---
It's a food way to get your camp leveled. Why not just do it at a workshop and build defenses. Makes for a cheaper repair bill.
---
Yeah they talked about enemy scaling down between players, but I didn't understand that as meaning that all enemies scaled up to your level as well...
---
It's a drastic change to the game's different areas now that all enemies scale up. Speaking as a low level player here... I imagine it's different for a lvl 250+ player.
---
To be fair while i agree with your point to an extent im not playing for other people so ofc my own character/enjoyment comes first above all else. 
---
"We were all new once" I was, but i havn't been for a very very long time now, i have no reason or benefit to ever put myself in those shoes again, this argument never held any weight in my eyes.
---
**With that said** while newer players experiences impact me very little if at all, if an issue seems to be *that* widespread and coming from a legitimate reasoning, then yes asking for adjustements is justified which in itself involves criticism. 
---
So long as its not done by throwing fits, trying to dismiss/insult anybody who disagrees with those complaints, i'll be ok with it.
---
The update didnt affect me at all but it seems to obviously be problematic for a portion of people. I have no idea how many payers browse reddit and how it reflects the community thoughts as a whole but if you take it from reddit alone, plenty of people seem to be struggling.
---
So yes maybe we need some tweaking, i just hope they don't go overboard to the opposite side and make things too easy again. Veterans/minmaxers are as important as new players/casuals.
---
Nicely put 👍
---
Yep like AI driven turrets built from a fan and a wrench.
---
I have tried others and imo becketts beats them out. Also why instigating on a .50 cal machine gun?
---
**no mic emote**
---
**sorry emote**

Crit
---
I think I just found a sodium chloride powered comment. Ad victoriam
---
I appreciate the sentiment, but I really wish people would share their feelings on existing posts rather than new ones.
---
Explosive mingun will down it in a few shots, escorts and the bot are down in under 30 seconds usually.
---
Rock  and roll baby!
---
Lol first off, as said, while I don't think it fits at all, more unique weapons in the game the better.
---
Second, I'm not saying that harpoon guns are the most appropriate thing to see in a mine. I said that things like grappling guns could very well be and a harpoon gun is something that could be seen as equivalent. A screwdriver isn't great at opening cans but it would do in a pinch. Same could be said for a harpoon gun. 
---
So, based on that logic, let me know what tool a gatling gun could approximate other than being a civil war relic.
---
Then it should be disabled immediately. That's a game-breaking bug.
---
Even eso has a chat where you can switch between whisper to one player, zone chat, region, guild, team, etc. 
---
They obviously understand the importance of the chat in their own games and just decided not to do it this time. 
---
As for the trade the need a better interface. Trusting people to drop or trade items for 0 caps is risky because you put your trust in the other player. Games like warframe let you select items to trade then you both agree and confirm the trade. Borderlands has it too where you just trade and put it up then confirm and you can also trade currency that way too. Warframe let's you trade platinum, the special currency, similar to atoms so people who buy or earn atoms can atoms to players. That acts as a better currency than caps and to get lots of atoms people usually have to buy them so Bethesda gets more money. They can fix the current system a lot more and even improve it a lot
---
my fixer and shotguns are great… Why would I not use them?
---
Yeah, i've encountered it several times. It looks like if you starting fast travel when companion is extremely close to you (maybe in case of models collision) - fast travel is picking up everything what is not stationary and whats inside your model and spawning on the destination. So yeah, i dont know how to control it exactly, but its technically possible to get your companion with you (but if on the destination point will be no enemies which could aggro companion - he will start to run back to the camp).
---
You can get 3 rate plans but thats a very small chance. 5%, 10%, 80%. For each difficulty.
---
Been considering swapping an unyielding SS chest piece for the lifesaver, with an asbestos lining,  and swap it in for boss fights. free up my fireproof perk slots.
---
I run with alot of mutations,  been wondering how big a hit I would take swapping out class freak for something to boost my ap or VATs so I can more freely utilize my maxed out hack and slash. 
---
Which by the way is a very fun perk.  Makes looting more of a choor tho. But really digging how it works in the big bosses adds.
---
I tried running with dodgy but it was sucking my AP dry. Tho I'm not dying it kills the fun of hack and skash.
---
No mystery to how the got it they spent 110 bucks for the atoms to rank up immediately. I mean its their money so they can do what they want with it. Ill just say the season definitely don’t keep me playing fallout 76, I always have played this game before any of the updates when the game was very stale and sometimes unplayable from exploits and bugs, all the new stuff is long since completed across several characters and I’m more than stacked, I have even explored the area of hacked and modded weapons and armor ( not to ruin the game for others but to know what is all out there for my sake, that and I’m not waiting around for Bethesda to add modding to FO76 but at this pace it will take till elder scrolls 7). But with only nukes runs and daily ops to repeat I find nothing more enjoyable than Running around killing anything i cross paths with my BE fixer and BFFFR Gauss minigun. But that is just me
---
Crit savy but rank depends on your luck. If you have a 34 luck, the max it. If not play around with it to see what rank you need to just get a 2 regular shit 1 crit cycle.
---
I hate big guns and automatic rifles work just fine. There's a reason.
---
Maybe I'm just tackling too many opponents at once koke a mad lad.
---
Thanks. That's a good option.
---
Does Dodgy work in PA? If I'm out of PA I see it proc regularly. I have never seen it proc in PA.
---
Taking One for the Team. If you're in a public team and have pacifist on someone can shoot you and trigger PvP. Had it happen to a friend twice last night.
---
Having Pacifist on means that you can unload an entire clip into another player and they will not take a single point of damage. And that means the PvP flag does not turn on. Which means they cannot damage you, even if they have Pacifist turned *off*. 
---
**WHAT** you are describing *(accidentally hitting another player, which lets them attack you back and kill you)* and **WHERE** you are describing it happen *(outside of a workshop)* means you have Pacifist turned off, and so do they.
---
PvP can only occur if both players have Pacifist off, or if it’s at a workshop, or if one of the players is Wanted. And the last two are the only ones where the ‘victim’ can have Pacifist on and be killed. 
---
You are wrong about how Pacifist works or you are not explaining the situation correctly.
---
FO76 is a bitchin game.
---
I like that the system doesn't forgive mistakes, it makes it more worthwhile.
---
Because the way bethesda made instigating work is kind of broken, it seems to do way more damage than it should. Instigating on high fire rate weapons seems to multiply the damage the first few shots do by an insane amount. It's best on the 308 mg, minigun and the gatling laser but works pretty well on the 50 cal too.
---
... because of people complaining.
---
Pistols need love without a perk giving it to them.
---
If it's not worth checking the subReddit for posts about this already, then it's not worth playing again.
---
same
---
well, my bad, I made a deeper search, and I found those effects in the data (i missed the reflect one), and I also found 9 possible spawn points for the ring in the world, so it's in fact legit, and not a hacked thing.
---
[https://imgur.com/RQ2YVyx](https://imgur.com/RQ2YVyx)
---
So.. back to the topic: you found a legit item in the game... good for you... this surely does not prove that hacked thing exists. You just got very lucky, I guess.
---
(and That's interesting, I might wanna find it for myself actually ;) )
---
Fun fact, in third person mode if u positioned the device close enough you can activate the wraith scarecrow,  enter a stash, and reload your vendors while playing the music. Probably alot more too.
---
Is fun for multitasking and setting the mood for guests.
---
Im playing a build that looks like yours. if you are lazy, you should definitely try born survivor 1 + fiel surgeon. Burn through stims but you will not bother with healing anymore.
---
Mine here:
---
VATS + Crits (Bloodied/50% VATS Crit Damage/25 Vats cost The Fixer)

---
In some occasions it is the only answer.
---
Might I ask why you need a substantial amount of vodka?
---
Huh didn't know that. I'm sure its connected to the frame rate that it ends up counting multiple bullets before the effect deactivates. Learn something new everyday!
---
I don't want the removal of penalties, that would make me sad.
---
Scaling is always a lazy and cheap „solution“ and should be banned and punished. The Game was Great without it, i bet most players hate it and doesn‘t even wanted it.
---
Troubleshooter armor is your friend. Probably much more so than any other slayer armor type.
---
Yes. You go to the second floor of the garage, walk cross the walkway, open the door, go into the adjoining room, then go up the stairs to the right. I did it last night. 
---
No Marsupial or Jetpack necessary. It’s *easier* with a Jetpack, but definitely not inaccessible without one.
---
I never said there wasn't any broken thigns in the game,  
---
The game is filled by broken things....
---
People just don't bother leaving or changing team's objective after doing OPS once.
---
And you did the diligent thing of recording this bug?
---
LMG is fantasic, but has no mods... I'd love to put _something_ on it.
---
Heavy gunner builds be like :
---
I'm a noob and have always played alone so far (lvl 40). I don't know anyone else who plays Fallout 76 and would really like to try making friends and teaming up  but haven't got a clue how. I tried to join teams twice last week, but don't really know what I'm doing at all and everyone just ignored me. How can I learn more about it?
---
&gt;We know that lots of you had a blast with Mischief Night last year (we did, too!)...
---
Hey, we know you loved this content but it won't make us any money so we didn't fix it, better luck next year!
---
Yea I got lucky and the first encounter of mine was lethargic and looking up at the ceiling as if it saw something, so naturally I mowed it down in 3 seconds before it could spin up those minigun for arms. The second round I wanted to see it actually attack me and holy hell that thing hits harder than a level 100 mole rate I took half a second before I just fell over, I was like wtf I wish I could replace my arms for turrets not fair! 
---
I just thought of something absolutely brutal and if Bethesda for some reason decided to add this I myself and maybe 5 other people would actually enjoy this but hear me out. So what if after you nuke fissure site prime immediately after the scorched beast queen dies a massive wave of 50 of those Sentry Assault bots ( We will call them for now ) they are all level 300 and they all have twice the health of the SBQ but same resistance as the one from the burrows did which was 350 ballistic resistance and 500 energy resistance. But if you are able to kill all of them within 15 minutes you can pick any single kind of 3 star legendary. Definitely a stretch but people thinking this be some cake walk and out come all of these fuckers like some marching band and the just keep destroying everybody would be nothing but thrilling. I would definitely have to resort to some for of chem stacking that is for sure! God I wish modding was thing now in FO76.
---
Yea, I have no perks in heavy gunner and took down a glowing behemoth in a few seconds with an instigating gatling laser it's stupid good. Angry turtle has a video on it I believe, I think it's something to do with latency issues
---
The update is out, so Beth will get info about it from the players and it can be balanced properly. It doesn't even need that much balancing. Low level players just need a little help.
---
Let's hope Beth cares about new players. 
---
People please don't reply with "Beth sucks and doesn't care about anything else but money" replies.
---
Oh is it considered magical?
---
This
---
bought mine from a player vendor for 400 caps. then the camp owner came over and gave the heart emote so im sure they actually wanted to sell it and it wasn't a bug.
---
I believe so yes
---
My new build right there, Bunnies beware!!
---
Yep you would be surprised how many leave when they see a woman on the team or if it’s just me they leave so quickly after. Plus I get messages asking if I’m a girl coz I’m to good to be a girl ffs what does that even mean
---
Ah that explains it.
---
I can’t be the only one who thought of the song when I looked at the title
---
I'm not lagging, but I think it crashed at least four times yesterday alone.
---
that doesnt stack with speed demon, unless youre stealthing or in power armor, or so ive read.
---
Its been happening to me the first time I open the map when I log onto a server. But not after that. I just thought it was to draw attention to the new stuff
---
It's been like this for me all the time.
---
3 points in first aid for the additional passive healing. He mentions how he switches out born survivor and uses it when he wants to be super tanky and not die, aka daily ops
---
Im digging that highlighted mineral idea!
---
I wouldn't quote me on it but I think the extra stim pack healing is so that the stimpack heals the full 20 percent instantly rather than half of it. With daily ops you get a loottt of stimpacks so not as bad as you think, up to whether you choose them though
---
They have mentioned trying to do something about the scaling to make it easier for lower level players in the next few weeks
---
Two gutters!, one for each hand, killing my enemies while sucking the life force out of them!.
---
Nice! Very similar build. I’ve tried born survivor before and yup damn it uses up a lot of stims, but having said that I seem to sell a shot load of stims to vendors every day so I might at least give it a go again. Cheers!
---
Healing factor mutation is a game changer for stimpacks. Once you get that, the need for them significantly drops off. I usually have 150ish regular and 150ish super and routinely dump the excess at robo vendors or on new players.
---
Chemist mod backpack is both a blessing and a curse. Its great for running around doing my day-to-day routine but it basically meant that I could no longer use Power Armor. With the new patch, I have changed things up a little and used the +Strength legendary perk to allow me to put on 3\* traveling pharmacy when I want to use my T65 in Daily Ops.
---
I want something that playes the creepy organ music so badly!
---
Would be amazing in my Silent Hill Camp.
---
They nerfed bloody alot almost to the point its useless now with the low health and damage output. My fully maxed fixer with nerd is 190. My junkies combat shotty is 400 dmg. But the game is a little funnier now
---
I wasn't in the direct vicinity. I was in discord with the person. I just showed up after to shoot at some of them. Someone had done it to me previously at his own camp.
---
You don't need anything from low levels.
---
ACP?
---
"the game I dropped money on suddenly changed on me"..
---
Really not that sudden. Quite expected, in fact.
---
Would love a means to play all the radio dramas on loop.
---
Time like breaking stuff? Are you not aware of Fallout history? Lore and cannon have always been 2nd fiddle to story. This is why Fallout 2 suddenly and magically created the Enclave that sat on an oil platform for 100 years doing fuck all and then magically they are suddenly around and influencing the wasteland. 
---
All bugs are given priority based on how much they effect game play. Lever Action Reload is or at least was a low priority bug that was passed over for other issues deemed more game breaking or game ruining.  If you know anything about even just software development then you know this is a fact of life. 
---
You are literally complaining about cut content sitting in the game data. Once again this has existed since the first video games. People have dug though game files and found a lot of cut content.   
---
All your post seems to indicate to me is that you don't know anything about game development yet you announce and declare things with all the unearned confidence of an illiterate 13th century peasant saying that all women's vagina's are hunted by ghosts.
---
Indeed
---
I managed to get it to stop by exiting the game client and restarting.  Today's the first time I'd seen it.  So I wasn't sure if there was a new setting or something.   Thanks for the responses.
---
Thanks for the help but Ive done all of that. Server hopping seems to be the only fix so im thinking its a bad server issue maybe?
---
So hearsay then? Shocking.
---
Gauss shotgun. It might miss a sure shot in vats like once every twenty times, but the one-shot capability is well worth putting up with it.  Do a Daily Op once and you are stocked up on ammo for a long time.
---
Also you can easily switch to heavy guns or to melee/unarmed builds with it, since all the damage multiplier cards are in strength.
---
My argument is exactly that they don't approximate any tools and it's a video game so logic doesn't matter for what rewards you get from an event. If there can be harpoon guns, why not a gatling gun?
---
Create your own team, and in most cases it'll likey fill up in a few minutes.
---
Also don't disregard other teams, even if they are not Op dedicated, if you can get into one and start the Op you'll be almost certainly followed by at least one other member pretty soon.
---
Do daily ops with a random team. 
---
Even if you can't deal damage you will still be a bit help judt standing on the uplink.
---
Im getting to the point where im just giving legendary items away to people in the group because my stash is literly 100% full of 3 star items just waiting to be scrip or sold to players.
---
I wouldn’t keep too many healing items so it might be a good idea to keep a certain amount, then sell the rest. If you take a look at your junk and see what you use most/least and bulk it and sell it to the vendor robots, things like cork, fertiliser etc are handy to have for some things, but you won’t need to keep much of it mate!
---
You can do that if you have a friend on your social list and make sure they know what your doing so they dont hope servers
---
&gt;To write that much and be completely wrong...
---
That’s exactly what you are doing. 
---
You do not have Pacifist turned on if you are dying from other players outside of a workshop and you do not have a Wanted status.  
---
Do you even know where your Pacifist setting is locates?  Go look, take a picture and post it. 
---
You said you have a video. Cool. Link it. 
---
On the infinitesimal chance you actually are experiencing this while Pacifist is set to ‘On’, then you are the only person ever to experience this. 
---
Unless you’re dying because someone is dropping Explosive Bait at your feet over and over while you just stand there. But that’s not what you described, and that’s the only ‘glitch’ I know of regarding PvP. And that basically can only kill
---
AFKers. 
---
In other words, you’re either wrong or you’re intentionally lying. 
---
Post your evidence.
---
Yeah, not really for me, I'm still getting SCORE but just by playing the game not doing anything out of the ordinary, I'll do the things I normally did before SCORE and I still get the rewards. The first one, yeah I grinded the crap out of it, did all the dailies, finished the weeklies in a day or two. Now? eh, I don't really care. I think I'm at level 11 right now in the current one, I'm not sure, what level is the first set of Lunch Boxes? That was the last reward I received.
---
You're level 24. Your weapons aren't max level so you won't be needing them long term, don't hoard anything that you're not using. You're better off with a few more caps or scrapping for plans.
---
Keep essential scrap for ammo, sell the rest. Keep enough chems to keep you going without going broke - no point having 100 Rad Away with how easy they are to find, don't bother keeping chems unless you regularly use them(ie dont bother with storing Daddy-O if you find yourself only wanting psycho for the damage buffs). Get rid of any ammo that isn't used in your primary and secondary weapons.
---
That's a good starting point at least. Inventory management is a key part of the game and takes a while to get the hang of, but you'll get there.
---
It was happening on multiple characters.  I played for a bit to see if it would stop, but it kept doing it.  Restarting the game entirely fixed it for me (so far).
---
I feel like zero imagination is the guy with the idea of adding mutated spiders to another game. On top of that dont feel special for knowing things about spiders. You know something about a useless bug that I kill everytime I see one.  Same as about 80% of people. Have a nice day of worthless knowledge.
---
Vampire weapons should be effected my nocturnal gear.  Cannibal perk effecting it would be pretty sick.  Get bonus dmg for so many seconds after eating someone face.
---
The first thing I do on the odd occasions I claim a workshop is build stash and scrap boxes and drop my crap off.  They’re literally the only place where a PVP mugging can take place on Pacifist mode.
---
Im actually leveling up pretty quickly again at level 160. I love it
---
Make sure you don't have a bunch of useless mini nukes crowding things up. After that, bulk some of the junk you have/scrap lower level weapons
---
Once per day
---
Same thing
---
yeah the repeatable gain XP is popping off all the time now thanks to the rebalance
---
There isn't one this season. Next one is in December. I suspect it will de during the week between this season and next season.
---
So far ive got the disease cure machine and two BOS special ops outfits (dont ask, ive already sold them both) if you get one you can make a fair few caps from selling them or get a fancy weapon.
---
Yea on Xbox it’s smoother. Went from the usual 12fps average to a steady 15fps. Great improvements
---
Interesting. Im wondering if they left it off the list of shotguns since its a unique one.
---
Stage 5 clinger.  LMAO
---
Yeah i think i will. I dont expect much to happen but it cant hurt to plod it
---
Just check player vendors. It's rare that there is a server without a player selling most of them. If you cant find them just relog. Also this isnt the market sub.
---
Yeah dodgy works in PA but serendipity doesnt unfortunately. When a mob hits me it will take around 20 to 30% of my AP.
---
On my PA toon after this patch i can still stand in the tennis court at The Whitespring golf club during a nuke zone and tank all the ghouls hits without an issue to get them all rounded up for easy kills just using dodgy 3, blocker 3 and topping off with quantums to keep my AP filled up. I do run emergency protocols to so I always ride at that 19% HP threshold mark.
---
Quantums are best as its instant AP regen whereas canned coffee is the next best thing as it's a consistent regen over 60 seconds. For just running purposes canned coffee would probably suit your needs perfectly, if you are adding dodgy to the list though canned coffee wont keep up on it's own, that's where quantums are king.
---
The first Daily OP with resilient robots was really fun for me solo as I ran what I described above and slotted in ricochet 3 too, using a vampires gat plasma and bashing them to finish them off, I never ran out of AP once and still managed to face tank the assaultron at the end with no issue at low health.
---
Strange. I could swear it runs a  bit smoother🤔
---
No. 90% is max. 
---
Sell them at your camp for 2 caps each and someone will buy them.
---
You can't get it as a legendary legitimately, but I guess nothing will change your mind at this point.  I tried my best, at least.  If I get my hands on something a little more obviously hacked, like an explosive laser rifle with poison damage, or a 50 cal with a beam splitter, or a gattling gun that shoots mininukes, or legendary unyielding power armor, would you want to see it/be more open minded to it's existence?  A lot of us on PC have events ruined by these things every day, so it's almost insulting to hear people say they don't exist, but if you're on console I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you may not have ever encountered any of these.
---
Highlighting of the mineral deposits should be an installable mod for Excavator helmet. Highlighting of the corpses should be an installable mod for Raider helmet.
---
Feel free to think of some similar functions of the other types of PA helmets.
---
Should I remove the take one for the team perk in favor of the recharge perk?
---
Someone tried the same thing with me and died. It's not hard to test.
---
I must have missed the announcement when they said they were *entirely* changing the combat experience and breaking the game for half it's players 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Depends on your style, I like being the tank class in games so the heavy gunner suits me, I also enjoy bear arms as I get a huge variety of weapons without a huge weight. My buddies prefer to deal higher damage and increased mobility so one is a shotgunner and one is a commando.
---
Okay. So a shovel and a pick axe aren't tools? And if you were to see all three sitting side by side in the mine you wouldn't think it's an approximation of a tool?
---
Hell, Maybe it's just literally a harpoon for hunting lurks or anything else. Fishing box next to their tool box. 
---
But whatever, you can't suspend disbelief on a harpoon gun, so then if that's the case have them to drop cursed fixers then since that's still the highest desired weapon in the game. 
---
If we're adding things randomly without point or context, why add a random low desirability weapon like gatling gun at all?
---
I've been server hopping for nearly two hours and havent found a single serum, hence the post
---
I play with a few friends and have made more characters just for storage. I use my friends to transfer my stuff.
---
A collosal problem
---
At some point later on it will be more convenient to stash cloth and acid instead of gunpowder. Gunpowder is far too heavy for what it should've been.
---
Caps are only of value to low-level players, high-level players are thrown in all directions.
---
Why are you getting downvoted for this? I feel the same way about no DXP this season.
---
This! Never have to make fuel again lol
---
Thanks mate 👍
---
Thanks for asking question OP as I was wondering this. Shit at the rate I'm going I'll get none of the stuff I want. I got one double drop of cage lights, the 94 STASH and that's it.
---
Really want Solar panels.
---
We got one last season im.pretty sure
---
Yet no evidence. How curious.
---
I got used to it but against rad rat are the worst ones to hit
---
Making the whole map playable to high level players is the best thing Beth has ever done to the game.
---
And they will balance it to low level players too.
---
Ok, thanks guys. I think I will play around with those and see what happens. I’m thinking about swapping it out for batteries included and then swapping that master infiltrator for legendary agility and running dodgy.
---
If I complete all ranks and gets no plans can I still get plans if I repeat daily op?
---
Each rank has ONE chance/roll per day to award a plan. If you earn elder rank it rolls all three ranks at once and you could get up to 3 plans if you’re insanely lucky. Once you do that you can’t earn anymore for the day
---
If you like pvp you can have a blast in NW. I'm lvl 110 and still having fun. Of course a cheater can ruin your experience here and there but overall it's not infested. If you notice one cheater, make sure to report him, I usually never see them again.
---
Pay more attention then.
---
My assaultron blade isn't showing either.  I though it was my darkmatter mod.  I took that off and they are still not displaying.
---
I think you can buy it with bullion at one of the faction bases
---
Unless it is needed to craft stuff like how Blood Bags are needed to craft Stimpacks. And you don't use it regularly then you don't need it or you don't need more then a handful at best. And even then that is mostly for boosts to get dialogue choices.
---
Food stuff like Honey, Sugar, Salt, etc I keep no more then 5 of them unless I plan to use a lot to craft a lot of foods. 
---
If you can start getting perks for Traveling Pharmacy in the Strength section. It reduces the weight of chems in your inventory up to 90% at 3 stars.  This allows me to carry simpack, super simpack, rad x, radaway, med x and psycho in large amounts without taking up stash space and without burning up my inventory weight.   
---
Also check ammo. It really isn't worth storing ammo you are not using in your stashbox. Particularly missiles and mini nukes as they take up a lot of space.
---
It's not game breaking in any manor, u can take the perk off or be more careful.
---
I'm sure they said you can get some of the rewards from Season 1 later on if you missed out on those
---
Well they don’t, or they’d get staff that have more experience with the Creation Engine to help tidy up this game. Hell, they could pay their *real* A team, the unpaid modders who pour their hearts and souls into this game to help fix it and make it into a playable state.
---
Thats what its used for.
---
It should be available for gold bullion at the faction vendors.
---
That is where marsupial gets handy,i jump on a roof or a bus and look at the sad deathclaw that just lost a meal.
---
4,000 is the cap unfortunately, I reach it consistently for events without being on an event team so I really don’t know why people do event teams
---
 Not being able to place the camp just because of an ammo factory seems a  bit dumb indeed. They could have made them disappear from every camp by  deleting the object from the game entirely and then replacing it.  Instead, people with stationary camps are now forced to build new camps  and learn a lesson where there's none to be learned really. Let's face  it: the amounts of ammo produced by that thing were ridiculous anyway  and gave you little to no advantage.
---
I don’t think it should be banned and punished, it’s just been very poorly executed, like everything else in Fallout 76. This scaling likely wouldn’t be as much of a problem if they didn’t nerf the living shit out of all damage.
---
I got 8:01 on a solo run...man what a kick in the balls.
---
It's happened a couple times today on PS4.
---
How about the people that were playing fallout long before survival was a tiny part of two of the games and before it was foisted on the masses in 76?
---
I've checked and couldnt see the item there, will it be included on later patches ?
---
&gt;I've checked and couldnt see the item there, will it be included on later patches ?
---
The 'Git Gud' comment misses the point of casual gaming.   We're not in it for the best build or the highest-powered weapons and shiniest armor.  We liked the other Fallout games because you could set the game to your style or, better, mod the shite out of it.  We still have these expectations.  Bethesda makes great worlds, not great games.  Exploring is excellent.  I don't want a walking simulator and I don't want Farmville with ghouls and super-mutants; I want to be engaged and work out how to complete parts of the game without the answer always being, more bullets and stimpacks.   The game inside this world is a mess and it undulates between too easy and too hard; let the player decide.
---
This is why my B2525 ain't getting no paintjobs, ever, until they either remove the portals to the Shadow Realm or make it so that you can't even accidentally drop or sell a favourited item
---
Bethesda should build the world and hire Obsidian to make a game in that world.....
---
Um what?  Hunger and thirst meters were not part of the franchise "forever" unless you mean survival difficulty in new vegas and fallout 4... and last i checked those were itty bitty small parts of much larger games.
---
I got two plans at once yesterday!
---
I had the same issue with my 2070S. If you have a G-Sync capable or compatible monitor and G-Sync is turned on, that could be your issue. Mine was turned on and I was getting 30-40 FPS. Turned off I get 100-144 FPS.
---
This such an odd hill to die on. Shovel: old
---
Pickaxe: old
---
Harpoon gun: old
---
Gatling Gun: old
---
That's about all there is to it. You brought up tools, I brought up tools. If you wanted to get real spicey I guess you could throw in a broadsider? 
---
Also why can't you use suspension of disbelief on the harpoon gun? If it's a reward from ACP is it really a terrible stretch to put in a gun that nobody uses and is sub-optimal even in its god rolls? The best gatling gun in the world is still worse than a mediocre minigun.
---
The announcements implied it would be easier because of the scaling, but it’s actually much harder for early-game players as they don’t have enough perks etc yet. I’m playing through as a new character now and it’s harder than their posts made it sound.
---
Those Tesla builds will get their asses kicked. Very *very* throughly. I’ll change into my ass/sent armor and go full on apeshit on them with all my aid, weapons and Quantums.
---
I don't believe so as only the base tier is repeatable and I don't think it includes any rares.
---
Lazy and condescending is a good combo.
---
Said it in another post, spread the word, we need a daily ops emote so we can communicate to our team via the team member list in the corner of the screen the signify we’re about to start a daily ops. Throw up the emote, wait for another member to throw up their emote in return and begin. Also if you’re on a daily ops and done with daily ops for the day and don’t plan on doing it again, leave the team. If you’re the team leader and don’t plan on doing daily ops again, change the team goal.
---
You get ultracite cores/plasma cores as a event reward when you kill the joss with that weapon
---
Casual gamer here.....
---
Events that I know are easy or quick.
---
LOOT LITERLY EVERYTHING in each location I visit. (Takes like 20 minutes in some locations)
---
Just stroll around.
---
I tried several restarts and it never cleared for me.  Very annoying!
---
Don't put yourself down, you don't appear to be either of those.
---
The fix for this, is unequiping all pieces of your power armor, and then equiping them back without exiting your frame. Works everytime.
---
I always said that.
---
Thanks! I hate it.
---
Yeah I noticed that when I was coming back from poking around down there last night for the 1st time
---
 O your not alone.
---
Great, now all we need to do is fix the virgins that one-shot sbq
---
No 10 is the lowest you can get. I think I have seen it normally between 40-70 and sometimes up to 90 or so.
---
Considering it takes 4-7 shots per kill, it is an amazing return
---
Flatwoods, vault tec university, firestation in ash heap.
---
I've wanted this since Fallout 1/2, honestly.
---
Yeah, that's why I use charging barrel. You can rapid fire it to deal better damage, because it's also more accurate, dead a bit more damage, and you can conserve ammo if need be
---
Oh? What's this?
---
Thx for telling me how I should feel about it (new patch)and how you know everything that there is to know about it . It must really be cool to be you and know everything and how everyone should feel about everything , you're an inspiration .
---
This. But only sometimes. If I use my commando, using a handmade or fixer, I get 5.56 or 45’s. Which is great. Same with my heavy gunner, I get the ammo I’m using. With my shotgunner tho, using my gauss I’ll get 2mm. But with shotguns I never get shells in return. Just random stuff. Good thing we got the ammo converter.
---
I agree. I usually start the Op, or go to the Op map and then throw up the team emote a few times. Sometimes people come, other times no-one shows up.
---
The inconvenience for me is really the time spent,  trying to line up an attempt to run this event with at least 1 other player.
---
All these options are good . The other guy said something about starting your own team and people will join.  All that's great, but in that time I can also server hop and find a team. My Pont was I hate spending 20 mins server hopping and waiting to actually play the game
---
Hey! Wiki is great start if you wanna start reading about mechanics and in game effects. You'll also want to start planning for your build here: 
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
It helps a TON so that you don't waste perk points as levelling is tedious as you go up in level. 
---
What timezone are you in? Console or PC? I'm in PC, I might be able to help you out explaining some basic stuff in the meta and help you out in game.
---
Welp, technically speaking, dual wielding for vault dwellers is illwresting.
---
Pip boy pretty bulky if you look as a 3rd model and vault dweller actually use VATS system by using Pipboy. 
---
(You can see the archer animation pretty fuck up because of that compare not using anything like dragonborn use bow. if you don’t have pipboy in example, the animation could be smoother)
---
Because these thing in the bracket, if you ask to take it off. I thought it shouldn’t be take it off.
---
- "Get it off? Why in the world would you want to do that? Your Pip-Boy's the best friend you'll ever have! Besides, you can't get it off. Biometric seals et cetera. I could tell you some stories about trying to take 'em off the old folks... ...ah, well, that's hardly a fit subject for a kid's birthday party. Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Pretty soon you'll wonder how you ever got along without it." Fallout 3.
---
Tldr: unless bethesda make it available, dual wielding should not be legitimate done. Or you can give up using VATS to do dual wielding,
---
This is bold suggestion, because many players want legendary effects gone from all PvP.
---
Would like to upvote but it’s at 76 atm
---
It hasn't happened to me, and I'm using an explosive handmade. I inadvertently shoot other people during events all the time, but pacifist is on. No one ever kills me.
---
Dude idk why you're like mad about the fact people are upset they completely changed a game that they have invested money in well past the base game purchase. You can't pay attention to something that didn't happen. Have a good day 👋🏻
---
I have all rewards for that event, but it's still fun so I still run it. Hmu if you want me to build a couple meat piles in your camp.
---
79, thank you!
---
No, once you unlock a rank that's the chances done for the day so if you get no plans after elder then you have to wait till reset.
---
The one that you need to collect bug parts for the incet repellent always instantly comes back. Its how I level up some days.
---
You can try doing the daily ops again with an Alt Character.  That can give you another four chances a day in getting the rare plan you are seeking.
---
There was no way of removing it. It was buildable by a bug but since it's never been programmed as a camp object, there was no option to remove it like other objects.
---
Understandable, no worries
---
Can’t wait for part 2 Mirelurk Kings - keep it up!
---
It’s good to make them aware. I know some other ammo types weren’t dropping before and they “fixed” it
---
Well, I can't say what you have or have not experienced.
---
But I have pacifist on, use several different weapons including ones with the explosive effects, and accidentally shoot other players all the time at events. I can't hurt them, and they can't hurt me.
---
If you have pacifist on, record a video. Show your settings, and reproduce what is happening.
---
I haven't tested my crit commando yet I just want to clarify the threshold is 33 luck.
---
A gUrL pLaYiNg vIdYa gAmEs?!?!? B...b...but she's good, and not just at the parts that involve collecting teddy bears and dolls. Must be a man in disguise! It's the only explanation.
---
One of my characters in the game is female to roleplay the Mistress Of Mystery quests and become the new one. At level 8 a guy showed up in my camp and kept dropping items, shooting at them, then thumbs upping me. Every single one was an item of clothing he wanted the female avatar to wear, but the Mistress bows to no man!
---
*hands on hips, staring into the middle distance*
---
Ahem, yeah, weird to see the creeps acting like it's 1950. Makes me wonder if the culture of the game world dragged them in rather than the genre.
---
I'm not mad about anything.
---
I find the people offering legacy gear and truckloads of flux for the spec ops suit to be a bit silly.
---
Within a few weeks a lot more people are going to have it and its value will drop.
---
Its not broken, but it has changed. With everything leveling to you, enemies have higher perception than before, so they can find you easier plus stealth bonuses are additive now also. You basically need max agility, stealth perks, and shadowed armor to be as sneaky as before. You can still sneak without the shadowed armor, but unyielding levels of agility and sneak gear is definitely more important than it used to be.
---
Sneak damage bonuses were changed with the new damage calculations, so the bonus is much lower than it used to be. Alternatively, critical damage has become more important because of this. Combining the 2 is the best way to deal damage now.
---
Yup I can't play at all. I too to the slocum Joe's near the wayward and kill what ever bad guy is there and crash server not responding. So I tried teleporting to vault 76 crash while dealt with the liberators. There goes my play time for the day
---
Then why do I have 4 at level 115?
---
One diseases each time you use it.
---
Talk about hills to die on dude, you're talking about a game set hundreds of years in the future, every ballistic weapon is old. This is likely the absolute worst argument for a change. 
---
But since this is all wasted conversation because they're not going to add anything to the roll tables, it's really not worth continuing back and forth.
---
I'm loving the daily ops in general its a fantastic way to get ammo for some of the weapons that chew through it like the flamer
---
Sent one in. Sent it via the feedback form thing since nothing else seemed to fit. Hopefully someone reads it
---
Exactly. I miss the old days when everything just cost less.  -I didn't actually offer all that for a suit, I was making a point 😉-
---
I create teams, ussually does the trick
---
Its more just being critical of builds that go against common sense, of course you're going to be doing low damage if you don't take the perks that give you a 90% bonus etc...
---
Yeah give it to me I repair it... JK
---
Do you have another character that’s level 150+?
---
Yeah but those are legacy
---
You don't really need the extra stim pack healing imo. I used the points on bandolier instead. But it's always just personal preference.
---
I would have chosen those too but I saw angry turtle's video.
---
Dosnt work on diluted stims
---
~~If this post is wrong then i stand corrected. Anyways i tested with 34.~~ [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abx0qm/luck\_an\_depth\_look/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abx0qm/luck_an_depth_look/)
---
EDIT: You are absolutely right, tested it ingame just now. Editing the post. Shows how little i have actually used critical hit builds like i wrote :)
---
Sophia followed me to faschnaut a few times. Hasn't happened since though
---
Indeed, the ripper would also go nicely alongside some Power armor and a gauss pistol to go full space marine
---
How do you get this screen? I'm always running around picking up ammo and stimpacks from all the corpses until the timer runs out. Do you have to exit before the timer stops?
---
Sounds like a burnt out gfx.
---
12, actually.
---
I don't use diluted, primarily super. Does it not work with superstims either?
---
Its not near as bad as reddit makes it sound, I'm full SS but have only unlocked mods for carrying capacity  at this point and I have to try to die, i still feel like a walking tank. Most enemies die to a burst now instead of 1 bullet (non-bloody commando).
---
Jetpacks are life.
---
Check bullion vendor in Foundation or Crater. One of them have it. Costs a bit but its there.
---
That would be amazing!
---
i mean, for low level toons, the nerf has been brutal. my main is doing fine, just using a bit more ammo like you said. but my level 31 has been getting her ass handed to her a lot, consistently running out of stims, and gear breaking constantly.
---
Explosives sucked before the nerf back then too.
---
They need to up the base damage on all those things you mentioned and fix their durability.
---
There has to be another member on your public team. And the enemy has to have hit you
---
Angry turtle did a vid testing it. Legendary perks tested part 3, I believe it was
---
The ally thing happened to me also. Server change fixed it. If it doesn't, store/scrap the ally item and rebuild.
---
Sounds like that server is due for a restart.
---
Try in a sub that allows bartering. This one doesn’t. 
---
You’ll have better luck elsewhere.
---
I have 420 on my sneak rifle build. She has 3 strength in special. Just have unyielding and make all 5 armors deep pocketed (thats 50 carry) backpack is 60 carry lvl 50. 5x unyielding is 15 str so 75 carry weight. It stacks quickly
---
1. Scrap weapons and armor to learn mods. If you have legendary weapons/armor that you have outgrown, consider converting them to scip at the nearest trainstation. Generally, non-legendary weapons you shouldn't hoard, most weapons drop easily as long as you know what enemies use it.
---
2. Use weight reduction perks for stuff like chems, and keep them on you to save stash space. Weight reduction perks do not apply to your stash, so what may be light to you, is not to your stash. Example: Fusion cores, with lvl3 Batteries Included perk, they weight 0.3 instead of 3.0
---
3. Scrap... use the tinker's station to "bulk" them up so you can sell them to vendors. 
---
   1. Generally, bone, ceramic, cloth, and glass are not that useful unless you are making specific items. So bulk up and sell those.
---
   2. **DO NOT SELL**: Acid, Adhesive, Plastic, Springs, Screws, Lead. These are used heavily. Plastic is used to bulk items. Adhesive, springs, and screws are used to make weapons/armor. 
---
      1. People will trade stuff for acid and lead, so you can almost think of them as barter currency.
---
let us attach all foundations
---
&gt;\-I didn't actually offer all that for a suit, I was making a point 😉-
---
Yeah, I figured. I was pointing out the sillyness of how much some people are willing to jump the gun and offer insanely valuable stuff for a single item that isn't even THAT rare just because it's new.
---
It's not like the spec ops suit has a 0.0001% chance of dropping once a week.
---
Nope. I did get my entire account wiped for duping and I had a level 176 character back then though.
---
that'd be nice, I didn't pay attention to the score since I didn't realize it happened or maybe it triggered at the same time as something else. Hopefully I got it too but I'm not too worried either way.
---
You need one team member besides yourself for it to kick in and the enemy must hit you first before it processes
---
It's made to be inconvenient on purpose, and there's a good reason. 
---
It stops people from all using the same camp hotspots. If an area becomes too popular, it becomes proportionally inconvenient to load into. And this is necessary to encourage a diverse area distribution of camps. Otherwise... problems occur.
---
For example... Let's pretend they used your proposed solution, automatic detection and placement. Say, if there were 5 really good camp spots that absolutely everyone liked to use, then servers would struggle to populate beyond 5 people, because once those spots are filled, no one else using the same spots can enter the world. It would stretch out worlds very thin.
---
Something needs to disincentivize people from hoarding good camp spots so that servers can populate properly. The inconvenience of having to reload the game manually if your spot is taken accomplishes that.
---
Simply, if you don't want to deal with reloading, build your camp at an uncommon location.
---
No it's just for sprinting sadly.
---
Not really. They do alright damage. But don't shoot very far, the ammo is very heavy, and just are meh in general.
---
You Sir, are a true scholar of the art of good old ultra-violence.
---
It works in supers, unless it bugged out again.. havnt tested it since the patch, they usedto work on diluted
---
PA is cool but 15 legendary effects is nothing to scoff at. I've got a 3* set of unyeilding SS with an armored backpack. I think damage reduction armor sets and sturdy perk is the way im going.
---
I have searched the garage for any outlet and have not found it.
---
Mostly no. They do pretty decent AoE damage but suffer from durability issues. If you have a decent stash of repair kits they're usable.
---
The Obsidian you're talking about doesn't exist anymore, I don't know if anyone is left from their classic hits.
---
I'm still a fan I think but nothing they've done recently has come close to new vegas or kotor 2 imo, I was really dissapponted in how bland The Outer Worlds was, plus have you seen their latest game? Grounded? It makes Fallout 76 look amazing in comparison lol
---
If Bethesda let modern day Obsidian touch one of their games, it'd actually be a huge step backwards imo, I'm not really a fan of their current writing styles, I think the last game I enjoyed the writing was the first pillars of eternity 
---
Anyway, one of the lead devs of the Wastelanders content actually was a black isle developer who worked on fallout 2 I believe. That's why classic enemies like floaters made a return I think.
---
I feel like the world of fallout 76 is much more interesting than the one from fo4, tons of interesting places to explore and lore to find 
---
So yea, the idea of Obsidian getting their hands on the IP at the moment = lol
---
I'll test it again with normal stims and see if it works there.
---
No salt involved. Just a bit of poking fun.
---
That might have carried over for some reason. Only way we could know for sure is if someone deleted their highest level characters and started a new alt.  Which I don’t think we’ll get a lot of volunteers. Maybe on the next ragequit post we can get one of them to help us out, for science. 
---
All of your alts should have access to four slots then as well. 
---
Not that I condone duping or using exploits, but it looks like you did get some lasting benefit even after your wipe.
---
No but you could intentionally wait until after the 8 minute mark to get a chance at knight tier.
---
Then run it again for elder for the 80 pct chance.
---
Yeah trading is much harder now for sure. I got my start making and selling ammo. Then buying lower tier stuff for caps. And trading my way up. But now you can't buy anything for caps. The ammo trade is out the window with this newest patch. And people only want to trade up.
---
I am one of the ass holes who has everything though and can be quite picky about trading now. Though I do try to do lateral trades with my mid-high ish tier gear to help people get what they need (specially if its something just sitting in my stash)
---
It’s there. I just did it myself last night. 
---
What system are you one?
---
I dont believe vats counts it as aiming. I know from actual aiming it takes a second or two to register you ads. And for the tesla, its either rifle/commando. No shotgun cards needed for the shotty barrel, just rifle
---
I didn't check the subreddit cause I didn't want to waste time trying to find answers when I could just ask for them easily
---
I agree. Been looking for a comment with guts.
---
Or get the legendary perk that automatically makes you have level 3.
---
Each rank has a chance to drop a a rare plan. 
---
Initiate has a small chance. Paladin has a slightly better chance. While elder has the highest chance possible. 
---
If you are lucky//skilled enough to complete it on elder on your first try, you’re basically done for the day. Because the game rewards you with the previous level of rewards. 
---
So if you beat it on elder, you’ll get the rewards for elder, and it’s chance for a rare rewards. You’ll also be given the rewards for paladin and it’s chance for a rare reward, then initiate, and it’s chance for a rare reward. 
---
So you COULD be extremely lucky and manage to get 3 rare rewards.  Maybe you’ll get one rare reward out of the 3. Or you might be very unlucky and not get a rare reward from all 3. 
---
You can farm and grind the event as much as you want. For the fun, the experience, the ammo, and the random legendary weapon rewarded at the end. 
---
But you cannot grind the event in order to get the rare plans. This was purposely done, because if you could do this, then technically speaking, any and every player could just farm the event and get all the rare rewards in one day.
---
I’d be happy with a section of out stash with unclaimed legendaries!
---
Just spent 15 minutes after heart of the swamp trying to find 2 legendaries that drowned!
---
Even the camera trick wasn’t too helpful
---
I see a lot of people on here say they suck and don't do enough damage etc...
---
But I keep 2 cause they're super fun to use. They do well against mobs...not so much for large single enemies.
---
My only complaint is the weight of carrying enough 40mm rounds to make the weapon last for more than 2 seconds.
---
I know there's the explosive ammo weight perk. I just don't like saving them up and taking stash weight, then switching a perk to carry all the ammo.
---
Anyway, I have a bloodied and an AA , both are good
---
True. There are many ways to proc pvp. However this one is the most unfair and toxic as of late.
---
Not that I've seen, someone must have taken some.
---
As long as you known the plan they can drop legendary from the purveyor
---
You did make me laugh 😂
---
FYI that the dps on furious is quite bad compared to Becketts AA one. Furious is +5% damage per hit on same target to +45% total and only the bosses should require 9 or more hits. I'm not sure exactly how much AA helps after one wasteland, but pretty certain it's at least +40% damage from hit 1 onward.
---
I was in a private😖
---
# PSA if you're going to complain about everything posted on Reddit about Bethesda , maybe find a different discussion website .
---
so then make it optional. dont take it from us. a lot of us like fallout BECAUSE of the survival/hardcore modes.
---
Bring the spiders on!
---
that's good to know, thanks
---
Does your god roll not 1 shot bloatflies and stuff?
---
Ah, then bugged i guess. Sorry to hear.
---
19 sep, just unlocked it and it also has no reward for me.
---
Might not be the hardware then... Could be the server, when i log in, it's mostly ok but the longer i play, the worse it gets. Anyway, it's nowhere near as bad as fo4, 76, i can actually play lol, i can't even go in downtown Boston without crashing.
---
[To quote Community...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MgNcE8mRM0)
---
It's a shame. Happens with nearly every new thing now
---
Yeah I figured it might be kind of a filler perk because he’s running 15 intelligence. I carry a lot of 2mm and plasma cores so I think if I keep the intel and get the extra carry weight it’s a win-win
---
All truth here. Unless your looking for a "fun gun" , u need one of the items list by the OP to get anything at this point
---
I would delete and reinstall
---
It’s okay thank you! It’s my first time that’s why
---
I bet the explosive damage from the gauss shotgun is hitting you and damaging your armor.
---
I suggest running Scorched Earth every time someone nukes fissure prime. The repair kits from completing it are awesome. I have managed to build up a stockpile and can keep most things repaired just using those.
---
It's a big cricket
---
If your whole PC won't start up it is probably a hardware issue 😟
---
Fallout 1/2 did not have hunger and thirst(unless you counted the vault 13 quest) and fallout 3, NV, and 4 did not have it either unless you chose to play their survival mode. 
---
Most people who did not play the game on hard mode are not used to survival mechanics and expected to play without it. I did when I first started but realized I was playing survival and adapted. Which saying that I am not mad or anything but it just drains too fast and I have to spend one session of playing to gather enough water/dog food to actually play the game.
---
Now with the new legendary perk Survival Shortcut. This is a game changer to me in my play style. I can manage my hunger/thirst and I get disease cures and something to top off my health without having to carry 50+ weight in food/water/stims. Granted I carry 200 diluted stims on me. But its nice to know I have those for bigger fights and not just the tiny damage I got from stepping on a punji board in lucky hole.
---
Flatwoods, whaat. Something so close and never saw it. Where exactly
---
No it does not. The same rifle with the same perks used to one shot mirelurks at “heart of the swamp”
---
I’m gonna make it clear that I didn’t intentionally benefit from my actions. I was duping the living shit out of everything good I had in order to give the poor people a leg up.
---
What the vendors carry varies from server to server. So you may need to do some server hops to find what you need.
---
You can buy the plans, or the mod itself.
---
Buying the mod itself means not having to have get the materials to craft it.
---
Sticking button perhaps. ? Depending on what system your on.
---
Do you think I can when it won't boot?
---
Dear god that would be sick. Straight up
---
Yep. I traded the for the full suit and it only cost me a Sympto-Matic plan for the suit and a JE minigun for the mask. I already learned the sympto-matic plan previously and earned a second one through daily Ops and the JE minigun I've had for ages as nobody has ever wanted it and I never use it so I think I got off pretty easily.
---
The RGB is lighting up, and the fans are working, but nothing will go through the monitor.
---
at least you can say what you want and not be banned for going against the hivemind
---
Scorch shooting at you with a grenade launcher you kill it and get a 38 pipe pistol 😕
---
Generally speaking no.
---
&gt; We need a text chat
---
"I'm sorry sir but this is a multiplayer game."
---
If you participated in the meat week event, one of the rare plans you could get was the tenderizer plan. Once you got and read that plan, you could craft a regular tenderizer yourself. Or as many as you wanted. To sell, give to friends. Etc. 
---
However you also unlocked the ability to get a legendary type of the tenderizer whenever you go to the purveyor (the mole miner vendor at the rusty pick)
---
So whenever you take a chance and try to get a legendary melee weapon, there’s a chance you might be able to get a legendary version of the weapon.
---
you're asking too much of bethesda
---
Better than I've had. I've got nothing the last 2 days. Competing elder
---
Ya pretty much everything is more viable now. My main is bloodied heavy and I carry B2525 50cal, Final Word AA25 50cal, and a VE 50cal. The difference in damage is negligible compared to before. Vampires is king in daily Ops.
---
They can only fit 10 types of items at once
---
Did you overclock your graphics card? If so, either tune it back down, clean out/fix fans and heat sink or it's busted.
---
Oh the pc isn't booting up I thought it was just the game my bad
---
No, and I can't get it to boot
---
yeah I highly doubt we'll ever get a text chat from Bethesda's side. It's one of the most used mods from the Nexus and it's availability from about a week after launch are proof how manageable it would be to introduce an official version but Bethesda doesn't seem to care.
---
And if you want to save yourself the trouble of getting everything for brain bombs, Brain Fungus Soup is INT +2.and a lot easier to make.
---
No, it's stupid. No one has to play everything, no one has to be ablte to go everywhere from start and beside that, i miss being able to kill mobs with a higher level than me. 
---
Beth won't fix anything, are you new? oO
---
The scaling is buggy as hell, i've seen at 22 a 63 wolf at savage divide and much more.
---
Havin always max level mobs everywhere is stupid and doesn't make any sense. It's so silly, 55 roaches? 55 Deers? Piss off...
---
This is the most stupid and lazy scaling i've ever seen and i played every Beth Game since Oblivion.
---
"So anyways, I started blasting" seriously would love to have dual wielding for pistols and maybe even smgs
---
I like 'The Outer Worlds', the gameplay is interesting. Bringing that Obsidian level gameplay into Fallout 76 would be an improvement in my opinion.   I agree with the world of Fallout 76.  Without too much thought, the best game world I have explored.
---
Thats some wasted potential, I would love a mothman quest and even more joining them as it's pretty weird running around with a mothman mask and praising him while also killing cultists that also like him.
---
Edit: Perhaps the next season? I mean its not too late, I mean we started getting more BoS content first now so..
---
You smell that? I think it's Synth.
---
Doesn't make up for how bad the rest of the game is though
---
Lmao do you have scattershot equipped in your perk cards I believe it reduces the spread
---
Yeah like another person said here, it sounds like an issue with your graphics card. Most of the time when this happens it can be either:
---
* The graphics card itself
---
* Or the Power Supply not giving enough power to the graphics card
---
If your computer has been crashing like that recently or on the past few weeks, it is probably a sign that one of those two pieces of hardware (graphics card or power supply) is faulty.
---
On a side note, is the fan on your graphics card spinning, or is it just the case fans and processor fans that are spinning?
---
No skin off my nose, friend. Hate the sin, not the sinner.
---
#ithappens
---
Yeah, you’re right. Still think it would be fun to try once.
---
But have they made it *any* fun at all to actually do?
---
Honestly you people are the worst part of Reddit hahaha
---
You all love to argue over stupid shit but none of your arguments are ever any good. Everyone on this site thinks they're a genius then pulls out garbage
---
Make alot of antibiotics. Takes care of disease cures and medikits. Plus you get 50 disease resistance
---
GPU fans aren't spinning
---
It's normal, you hit the "jackpot" reward for the savage divide that gives all of said items. (Like a 0.2% chance iirc)  that reward has been that way since they pulled the scout masks out of the enclave vendor
---
It's probably a bug that the items are rewarded in that way, but be excited that you hit that chance and got rewarded all those rare items!
---
Ha! I actually rolled a Bloodied and AA nade launcher from the last sale. I forget the other perks, but they seemed like they could be fun for swarms and ops with camo enemies. I don't run a low HP build, so I'd go with the AA one.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
They're much tankier!
---
But aren't some these item hard to get?
---
Done this on open server, think someone farm raiders before me (when I enter, find some dead raiders) , but for me there was respawn of caleb, surge and lev. Caleb respawned down below as inteded.
---
You can try also to kill Caleb in some holes - windows blocked but if you jump here and there you can see inside. Just don't kill surge before caleb.
---
I really need those stimpack diffusers for my alt and my friend for the possum challenge
---
I know, I tried to be as thorough as possible, but of course I couldn't include everything. Thank you for your feedback!
---
happy days i suspected with the tesla barrel it was the case.
---
it kinda shreds on the ops against bloodeagles
---
The masks are the biggest value and unfortunately nothing in game is rare anymore
---
Oh, that's a bummer.
---
Like, how bad? I had a challenge to kill a few enemies with a fatman before and it literally needed to be repaired 4 times before I completed it. This was before enemies scaled to you 
---
o.0
---
Sure, invite me over, I'll place it and you move it where you need. Xbox = hot tiger soup
---
Hello ☺️ i'm lvl 35. First pj. I start to play before patch and it was very nice, lots o bullets and smalls creatures to kill. After patch, the wasteland is a scary place, but this is the way its suppose to be. I kill some, i run a Lot, i take care of My bullets. It's an apocalyptic World, not Disneyland. Don't kill all, you are an small thing in a Big World, choose yout battles. Good luck ☺️
---
Agree with this as long as you can change from local to global etc. Most of the times I wouldn't care what anyone the other side of the map is saying but would talk to people I pass by, see at my camp/events etc.
---
True
---
Ya I quit. I just got no mans sky.
---
Your limited to 10 weight worth of items in the machine, iirc most chems weigh between 0.5-1 weight each, my guess is that you hit the weight limit
---
Firstly, the interface is terrible and it will make you not want to use it despite its utility.
---
Second, as others have said, it should be available at a faction vendor, but I'm not sure which one and it probably requires max rep with them.
---
I run a bloodied heavy gunner. Got hold of a bloodied auto grenade launcher. I don’t struggle with carrying ammo. I can carry about 300 or so grenade rounds before I get too heavy to pick anything else up. I took it into the daily ops yesterday thinking “invisible mobs - best to just blind fire grenades then.” Have 5 points of demolition expert since all my other heavy guns are explosive. I think the whole process went really well at first. The problem was when the mobs turned into individual spawns in which case the grenade launcher has no purpose.
---
You haven’t seen griefing until you’ve played GTA Online as a low level character.
---
So many people still think this is what happens.
---
Ah, sounds like the GPU is at fault. Most of the time when it's a PSU issue the GPU will at least work on low-loads, but often will crash on high-loads (like gaming for example).
---
I mean if you know how to (I can't take responsibility for anything that goes wrong of course), you could always try to unplug and remove you graphics card. Then see if you can blow a bit of dust off it, let it dry and then plug it back in.
---
Don't sweat over the new outfit. There'll be another one with slightly different colors available from the atom shop once Steel Dawn goes live. They've done this with every 'rare' event outfit, for a while now.
---
I always start my own daily ops team, and kick anyone who doesn't join on me after I start the event.
---
I mean, all the people yelling "get the right build" to those who are struggling right now, that's essentially saying "git gud" with extra steps.
---
If you get 1 you get them all
---
Very little has changed in terms of the meta. Bloodied is still top tier. 
---
Your problem is the semi auto weapon. DPS is king. Maybe a problem with your build too.
---
You may want to post to get feedback from community.
---
Why are you in a subreddit for a game you hate?
---
Feels like it
---
I've already got one but I though it would make the best current example to prove my point 😉
---
&gt;I bet the explosive damage from the gauss shotgun is hitting you and damaging your armor.
---
🤦‍♂️👀OMG and I have Demolition Expert, I don't know how to thank you, I remember hearing about this and completely forgot. Will change things up now.
---
You = Star!!
---
That is what I am saying. It isn't a problem if people with non-combat focused builds are unable to complete end game raids by themselves. The problem is that those people shouldn't be struggling against every single enemy in the game and they shouldn't have to spend all their resources just to win a single fight. This is why people are complaining. It is a fact that the game has become horribly unbalanced.
---
No problem, I loved it nevertheless - the part about Colonel Gutsys really caught me.
---
I know - fuck them, right? Them bastards.
---
Edit: I assume you mean the lv75 ones
---
You can make.them work. Make sure to spec into explosive perks and add the barrel mod. They actually will hit in VATS, too. It's not going to be your go to for a main, but definitely fun to play with for a session here and there. Pretty ammo efficient too. I have an instigating one that I run around with sometimes for the laughs.
---
Like an old game cartridge, right?
---
I've not tested it since patch. They're not quite as bad as the fatman but all explosive weapons ( not meaning the legendary effect ) suffer from the same durability issue. I have an explosives character that mostly gets neglected because as much fun firing a two shot mirv launcher at stuff is it's just not a viable build until the durability problem gets some attention.
---
Just buy the ballistic fiber. It's so much more time and resource efficient than farming for it. The caps you need to spend to buy it you can easily get selling all that level 50 gear.
---
Also, if you're armour is getting destroyed that much that often, maybe your playstyle needs to be adjusted. I don't even mean change it completely, just tweak it. Shit like don't engage 5 enemies at once (like you might helping out those noobs), just a couple at a time.
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
Wouldn't it be hilarious if this whole change was down to someone at Bethesda thinking "We'll make more ***endgame content*** just by making all the enemies max level!"
---
No enhanced version for next gen
---
I'd come back for that
---
You could add the dense mod to your armor and/or the fireproof perk in endurance and those may help offset it some.
---
Sounds like you'll fit right in.
---
You just have to hit escape (for PC) before the time runs out and you get booted.
---
I went there yesterday and was still one shotting the regular dudes with my AAE lever action rifle, though. A bunch of glowing ones would make me a little nervous though.
---
You are talking from out of your ass though, bro. No offence
---
Happened to me for the first time yesterday. I restarted the game and it opened daily ops automatically once but then it was good
---
Yeah I’ve found that really weird, don’t get it
---
Huh, what build you using?  
---
My weapon, which isnt a god roll by any means is killing most things in just a couple shots
---
Yet. 
---
But auto uprez will happen regardless and so yes for many people if you have the right type of TV it could look and play better then on the PC.
---
I'm going to run an op with a vampire's auto grenade for science now. Will let you know how it goes.
---
Daily Ops team should just automatically throw every existing and new member into the dungeon when somebody starts it like in every other MMO.
---
Well said, now they can easily buff and nerf stuff, so they say. All the useless effects need sorting so every build has pro and cons. Every build needs to be viable. 
---
Every weapons class should have at least 3 big damage dealers. So every class has weapons that are viable too. 
---
Variety is the spice of life. After all.
---
A bit like that, but with a few more steps, check this video first [https://youtu.be/IqnYWsHNGaI](https://youtu.be/IqnYWsHNGaI)
---
I would say take you time on it. Removing the Power Plug from the GPU is pretty easy. Removing the GPU from the motherboard make sure you remove the screws and press on the clip. Don't use force, if it doesn't come out from the motherboard after removing the screws you'll need to make sure to press on that clip (see the video)
---
+1. And I'll add to that comment that Fallout has NEVER EVER been about "optimizing your build for max DPS." 
---
This franchise is about wandering a wasteland and having fun. It isn't WoW. It's a casual's paradise. It was honestly never a great fit for an MMO to begin with, and the horde of tryhards that took up nesting in the far corners need to just go away.
---
There's a reason everyone likes Meat Week and Fasnacht, and most players never bothered doing the Vault 94 raids.
---
I imagine them having a little dial anf they just crank it up to level up enemies
---
It's generally accepted that a system like the perk system is intended to provide options, and therefore that mandatory perks are A Bad Thing.
---
Yes traders wanting ridiculous trades is a bit greedy, but so is wanting the new outfit within the first 4 days it is available. If you want a good deal you could wait a few days or weeks. They will be selling for 5k caps or less soon enough.
---
Right.  Because most of us have never died there.
---
I haven't been following build discussion lately as I just got back into 76 after a long break, are non-bloodied builds really that bad now? 
---
So far, I still deal a lot of damage to most mobs (glowing wendigos and robots are hell), so I can't imagine how bad other builds have it.
---
I had Sophia follow me to the SBQ sometimes. It was uh... Well, she did her best and I'm proud of her.
---
Semi-auto got hit hard in the damage change. It can still be done though. I ran through Westek with a semi-auto quad Fixer at full health last night and managed it just fine (I did it to prove a point since that char is normally stealth bloodied commando). The slow firing weapons like the hunting rifle and lever action are not nearly as viable as before but the Fixer and Handmade in semi-auto can be viable.
---
It's because the game added weapon condition, when they die their dropped weapon beaks apart!
---
Thankyuuu!!!
---
You can get 16 ballistic fibers at Camp McClintok, from military ammo and military duct tape. Takes a few minutes to collect them all.
---
Get the perk White Knight. Reduces the cost to repair armor. 
---
Use the perks that reduce the rate your armor breaks down.
---
And yes also buy ballistic fibers from bots that have them.
---
Please please understand, you DO NOT have to do all the challenges everyday to get to 100. Take some time off it you need and just enjoy the game
---
Finland literally follows the model I explained previously, except that as opposed to the parent being the one who forces the kid into wanting a learning spree, it's a teacher.
---
Blood for the blood god, skulls for his throne
---
I know it depends on the landscape a bit, but have you tried finding the corpses with your camera?
---
I'm hearing that the scaling is way off, and that it's fine at first, but around level 20-30 it ramps up massively, then the growth slows back down again.  I have no first hand experience of this but that seems to be what people are saying.
---
So it’s happened to me before. Most times he’ll have good bit of ammo and about 5 or 6 weapons. But sometimes I’ll come back and he’ll have just one kind of ammo or a gun. I usually just empty it and then it fixes it
---
Happened to me yesterday, I forgot to leave it after completing the daily, oops. Took me like 20min to notice it.
---
Wait, I think I figured it out. I think that the 8 pin came loose.
---
Lol that’s why I said that even the camera trick didn’t work!
---
Nice ! Great post
---
Yes, amazing for sending ghouls in to the stratosphere. No because they break super quickly and are heavy.
---
What platform are you on? I have notice that the pc market is sooooooooo much cheaper than the xb1
---
Here is the trick:
---
Don’t run into the daily op until you have 3 people inside the start room.
---
Wait to start the timer until you know you can do it. I join those 3 man teams and sit in the room and emote “come here” until they join up. Normally when one comes, s/he will emote with me and get a third, at which point you can start.
---
Truth is you can do it with 2 but you need to be on the points at all times, and that is hard for randos
---
Aahhh, cool, I hope it's as simple as that, let me know if it works again 🙂
---
No others. Fuck them.
---
For ranged combat I use a gatling gun, so I would love that. Good suggestion!
---
Equip Lucky Break perk or craft Secret Service armor (doesn’t need ballistic fiber to repair)
---
You don't need to go to that particular bench. You can use the one at the gunshop or any other tinkers bench.
---
If I'm in charge I change it to a casual team, if I'm not and they don't Change it or go back in I just leave the team and start my own casual team!
---
The bonus xp/Int is only really useful if grinding XP.
---
If you're not too fussed about xp, and are in a team for shared perks/herd mentality/free fast travel then it doesnt really matter what type of team you're in
---
Or you need a lot of flux. I don't have F1st, so I can't do those trades, despite having a lot of great high value items to trade.
---
BURN THE VAULT DWELLER!
---
PURGE THE MUTANT!
---
PRAISE THE MOTHMAN!
---
People that had pails left over from the last treasure hunter event are getting the new rewards already.
---
You can get a maximum of 3 rare rewards per day, one in each tier, if you are very lucky.
---
I have Skeet Shooter in perception if that's what you mean the strength scattershot reduces weapon weight and improves reload.
---
The spread seems ok just the aim is way of, this is in 1st or 3rd person  😒
---
What pistols do you use? I am low level, about 40, and my best guns are my .44 snub nose for loud, and my painfully slow bolt action pipe gun+ suppressor for stealth.  Just wondering where I go from here.
---
I was afraid my set up was gimped when I realized I couldn't fit all the pistol and stealth/sneak attack perks I wanted...
---
No system will ever hold 144fps on this garbage engine. Here and there 30-40 fps is normal, but usually you should be well over 60.
---
Also, what speed is your memory and its running in dual channel?
---
No the game with not play in better resolution.. unless they add an update
---
This ain't original Everquest where it takes a party of 6 several minutes to kill 1 mob or FFXI pre-leash where you can dump a horde of mobs at a zone line to murder someone zoning in.   Just shoot it in the face and it dies.  Griefing isn't really a thing in 76.
---
The person who forces the pvp uses the perk!
---
Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Thought maybe it was Xmas presents again but had heard they fixed that.
---
Thanks, dude. Vamp sounds like it would be an awesome roll. I got an AA and Bloodied in the bank
---
Try 3rd it really changed my game play
---
They tried that and every second thread on the board was how the game is impossible now that everything is a bullet sponge despite still only taking 1 or 2 shots.
---
Imagine if they actually did fix damage so thing were a challenge.
---
Get to cover, throw plasma grenades. So when they scatter you can fight them more easily. Also the VATS grenade trick works on them too.
---
Thanks, I have dense on my SS chest and fireproof 3\* already, it must just be my play style and the now scaling enemies I'm lvl 367 , will have to spam those queens by the looks of it.
---
lucky you, great drop :)
---
Well yeah, its annoying.
---
I think it's a very decent weapon personally. I only have 2/5 of demo expert (bloodied build though), and I used one (with +10% dmg for having a mutation / +25% rate of fire) during the daily ops with the super mutant. With 3 shot I could kill a bunch of them, and looted like 4 grenades on their bodies so I managed to also farm a lot of grenades.
---
I don't use it very often and only against group of enemies, but with vats it can have a surprisingly really decent range. Also it's super fun, I think it's a great supportive weapon to keep and use.
---
Also I have gunsmith at rank 3 and I really don't repair it often in regular use. And in the daily ops I barely see any degrade.
---
It's not that hard if you know where to go and stockpile the right items for trade.
---
It's called the Atom Store 💰💲💲/s
---
What if I could use stimpaks while my heavy weapon was still cycling down haha
---
TSE lever gun kills things in a few 2-4 shots when it used to be one. My zealots ultracite plasma caster kills things in 3-5 shots when it used to be one maybe two. My ultracite gauss shotgun kills things in 1-2 shots when it was always one. That’s a pretty radical change from a time and resource position. I worked sooo hard to get these weapons. Ammo and resource management is a major part of the game. There is a cycle you you forage lower level places that cost less resources so you can use those against “endgame” content like earl or the SBQ. If the cost for collecting resources goes up 3x-5x I think it’s reasonable to be upset.
---
The Auto Grenade Launcher are the best dps out of any exclusively explosive weapon!
---
They're more powerful than a micro nuke.
---
Use vats and it will always hit!
---
Yeah or you get nada like I got for hitting elder in first run yesterday. But I got plans everyday before that so I’ll consider myself lucky on that part.
---
Use vats, they home!
---
the other day a player joined the social group I was in. just her username got me so excited because it inferred we were two of a kind: OldSchoolGamerMom. after rushing to visit her base and dropping an assortment of what I hoped she'd think was nice stuff, I jumped around like an idiot, emoting hearts, thumbs up and no mic, and was a total gushing fangirl -- she reciprocated and I randomly friended her which she accepted, but I wanted \* so badly\* to be able to message her somehow, even offline. hate to think I have no real way to befriend her, or even tell her I'm not a stalker/creep but another old school gamer mom too and would love to hang out together in the future.
---
Thanks. If I can get my hands on an explosive 50 cal, I might commit to using the nade launcher as a back up/splash weapon. 👍

Sophia loves it!  XD
---
Brother!
---
Event team = 1-4 players who are likely to do events vs hoping randoms join in
---
People farm it. For ammo and stimpacks.
---
New griefer tactic, had it happen yesterday just after the SBQ died and we were mopping up the leftovers, they'll purposely get between you and whatever you're shooting which pretty much force initiates pvp. I wasn't exactly sure if it was by mistake or not so I stuck around and killed another SB flying around, same guy that just killed me earlier runs up and starts jumping all around in my face while I'm shooting upwards at the SB flying overhead, was pretty obvious at that point.   
---
Previous loot I dropped on death was nowhere to be found so it was definitely looted. Still had flux in my inventory though, which I don't rely on for anything. I dropped it at his little fallout 1st cabin since he seemed to want it so badly, waved him over and before he could get there someone else ran up and grabbed it.... XD
---
Yeah it was the easiest and I felt it had less enemies then the others. I’ve really been enjoying these daily ops ☺️
---
Its fine, itd probs introduxe 7 new bugs from fixing it
---
Mothmen cultists are heretics and must be purged.
---
I am always interested by actual proofs. 
---
All what I have been able to witness is magic combo effects or legacy weapons (which are a plague).
---
Legitimate or not, your ring will not boost your damage by 1000% anyway.
---
Same, I started the OP with like 6,000 5mm, ended with 12,000. Same with .50.
---
I’d like the notification to be front and center. I’ve been on an Ops Team waiting for people to join and actually want to participate, and after a while I just go back to playing the game. Sometimes though, after that while someone will actually start the op and I’m late to the show.
---
No, that’s actually how it works. It’s a bundle drop of the masks and jumpsuits.
---
daily ops are ridiciluous
---
This was inevitable when Bethesda didn't add any good caps sinks and made their legendary system a mini lottery.
---
Thanks man! It worked! If I wasn't broke, I would give you gold!
---
He could have been rid of it sooner *by moving his camp* at his leisure.  Now, he’s being evicted.
---
*”But it never had power”*...he said.  Sure, sure.
---
Can pip boys sent/receive messages? It’s possible to type in them somehow as each quest or mission has a custom description, implying we are writing it as it’s written in the first person
---
And here I thought I was finally done learning stuff about this game. What's with this "VATS Grenade trick" now?
---
True enough, for the last day or two since rolling my vampire's gauss shotgun I've moved to this as my main weapon. 
---
I've always been a 1st person player but have moved to 3rd person for the fire rate on these guns, just takes getting used to, but it is pretty good by comparison less claustrophobic also., I like the wide view to see enemies.
---
Along with lvl 50 rippers and a bump in damage
---
Tapping the jetpack button while being flung by a spiked board trap does!
---
Yep same, i wish someday i will have the option to remake my [ Super buffed Ada](https://imgur.com/VNXHYNJ) . I will be happy even if they just saty at our camps as a part of defense.
---
Not that this is a good example, but without these comments any sub becomes more of an echo chamber. But it would be better if it was constructive critique instead of trolling
---
You probably know what it is. It's when you lob a grenade. Then you hit VATS while it's in the air to shoot it. You can better time you explosions that way.
---
Damn😖😖
---
I usually do it at the Overseers house on they way back since it's right in front of you when you fast travel there.
---
Dang😖
---
Wait......you don't run at full pelt screaming "BRINNNNG IT!!" right from the get go?
---
And is the “scrap” option not available? That’s weird.
---
Isn't it better to just do ops in the +int team since you only get the exp reward finishing it the first time?
---
And if someone is repairing a doodad, stay away from them. You'll reset the press-timer.
---
Ooo that one. Sorry, I just assumed it was a new screw-up made in Bethesda.
---
so if your trying to sell guns, and aid items you are very limited in how much you can sell 
---
just fix the bug that lets ppl increase there budget
---
I'm glad it worked and it was a simple fix! Have a great weekend, enjoy your gaming 👍
---
And do you have something interesting to say, or you are just that drunk dude who comes and insults people when he sees some light?
---
I remember during the weeks leading up to release how I thought this game would have text chat, guilds, functional trade ui, and mail boxes, things that other online games figured out FIFTH-TEEN YEARS AGO.    
---
    
---
Two years on and I'm simultaneously shocked and not at all surprised that Bethesda hasn't added those basic functions.
---
Nah, I just use that method when fighting Colonel Gutsy's. Those things are the devil.
---
Dude, I should not post first thing in the morning. Somehow, my brain processed your sentence as referring to the 3rd person camera method that people use to find bodies. I'm majorly facepalming over here.
---
Does anyone know when these reset? It it at the 12pm EST reset with the challenges?
---
DEATH TO THE FALSE OVERSEER! then. :p
---
I use a j25 lmg. I ran one daily ops and did not get ammo profit :0 so like yeah ammo factory
---
I for one don't know whether we "need" a text chat or not, but if a text chat is implemented at some point, then what we *will* need is the ability to completely disable it from the options.
---
Sure, there might be people who don't know exactly what to do in the daily ops or during The Colossal Problem, but can we guarantee that the chat won't devolve into a toxic cesspool of namecalling and wannabe "raid leaders" trying to micromanage everyone else's game?
---
Can we guarantee the chat outside of those events won't be full of people insulting others for vendor prices or camp locations or whatever else?
---
Can we guarantee that the chat won't be full of people whining about how nobody is giving them free stuff, or why people aren't doing the events they want to do, or playing the game in a certain way?
---
I firmly believe that one of the biggest reasons why there are threads every now and then popping up on this subreddit, calling the community in this game the best there is and so awesome and wholesome, is the absence of a text chat. Especially since it would be 100% unmoderated, with only reactive punishments being given long after the fact through reports.
---
Still, personally I'm fine with there being a text chat in the game as long as I can fully opt out of it.
---
I googled that and tried. In order to gain access to the Brotherhood of Steel, I have to begin the free states quests.
---
The mobs up there are lvl 65 super mutants and gulpers. I struggle against 2 level 50 robots.
---
who sells it? I can do that.
---
It does?
---
6 shots is not bad and can be done quickly. Damage got nerfed a bit too hard, so they need to buff a few things, but this isn't a nightmare to balance anymore.
---
So I got fucking wrecked by a liberator hoard last night and it made me think of this post haha. How are you finding everything now that the patch is live?
---
My bloodied build is kind of ruined though, not because of the nerf to bloodied weapons, but more due to the terrible damage buff I get from rifleman  perks and just damage perks in general.
---
can we see, this is sus af, feel like if you rolled one you for sure post a screenshot right
---
I was just using a Suppressed Handmade. There is an opening on the top right of one of the boarded up windows you can shoot throw by standing on the railing in front of it. Took some time to get the shots angles just right but I can confirm that it is doable
---
The annoying thing with that, there is a chat function in game but not activated, why ? Bethesda seriously why ? We need a response
---
Most of my armor right now is combat with Brotherhood of Steel. I have 1 heavy leather that gives me stealth when crouched.
---
Why do you say "Even" ? ESO is a full on MMO so having a text chat was a no brainer there.
---
Googled what? McClintok? That’s in the forest region and there’s no mobs at it. Just friendly robots and a young man. 
---
You’re thinking of the wrong place I believe.
---
The people telling me to "git gud" or telling me how I need to grind for 20 more levels to get some different perk cards....I just ignore.  That isn't how I play, and I was doing fine before the update.  I sneak, I snipe, I roam, I actually enjoy the landscape.  The visuals are stunning, after all.  I'm a casual player that jumps into one or two big fights a day and spends the rest of the time gathering resources and enjoying the journey.  The bigger battles haven't changed, but the "enjoying the journey" part has.  I can't.  That was the main reason for playing, and it's gone.  The only reason I did the big fights was to level up and get perks and s.c.o.r.e.  I get it that not everyone plays that way, and for some, the changes was an improvement, and I'm happy for them, but I just want the \*choice\* to play casually, to play the game I paid for and subscribed a year to, and I don't have it now.
---
Yeah, but it's 10 different items so I believe you can keep stacking your existing ones
---
They are by far not an agile company, agility would require flexibility by the devs but they for sure don't have that. Some others in 2019 made more elaborate posts about how ancient Bethesda's management is and how they should change from a boss deciding each specific step for the devs to the devs deciding in their own group how they're going to approach a problem X and so on.
---
Most if not all of the vendor bots from memory. You'll definitely find at least 2 bulk packs of 10 at the Whitesprings but I believe other robot vendors have it too.
---
Ever since it was sold, I stopped farming it. Waste of time.
---
OK. I have been enjoying the whole map with my main character level 221 and don't miss the times I had about three things to do in endgame. 
---
I can't say how bad the patch is for newbies, but I don't think Beth had much info from PTS about it. Saying Beth won't fix anything is stupid, because Beth does fix things, but not enough. Thats not anything.
---
Hate all you want, but the endgame was awful before the patch.
---
I got the same with my gatling plasma. It's a legacy explosive one though, so maybe that's the reason. Anyways, no one plasma cores for me...
---
So the changes have actually made more things viable since bloodied and junkies are not so much better than everything else. You don't need to use one of those builds to be effective, but you do need to focus a build to be effective. I don't know your perk loadout or what weapons you are using, so I can't really comment on your situation in particular, but I know that a lot of the people complaining have builds that are not optimized for what they want to do and tweaking a few things could make them viable (sure certain weapons are much less useful than before, but there are usually alternatives of the same weapon type that can be useful).
---
For your situation in particular it could be a number of things. Are you running headfirst into battles? Are you using explosive weapons at point blank range? Do you have damage mitigation perks (not ones that add damage resistance, but ones that actually reduce incoming damage)? These are some examples of what you should consider should you choose to think critically about your build and stick with the game.
---
i saw your post with the screenshot but can you throw a plasma mod on it for proof.
---
Those gave no problem at all,beside killikg the queen,that's officially vugged with no tricks.
---
Man, I've been saying this. It would be sick. Bethesda, hear our pleas.
---
I've been invited to party chat with teammates and had them suddenly shocked that I'm not a dude. Like my pfp on xbox is a pic of me, and my name is Lexxi. 
---
I know many guys play with female characters, but come on...its not all dudes playing as chicks 😂
---
Well said Mr. Sloth
---
What's wrong with it?
---
I love my lever action rifles, sad though that I can’t one shot enemies with my instigating ones now. Takes like 5-6 shots for tough enemies though I am spec’d for it but full health.
---
I asked on the PTS and I believe they said it was still coming, just not with One Wasteland anymore. So I would say June 2039 is a reasonable expectation.
---
oh. I thought that was the fort where the BoS made it's last stand.
---
I've never pushed beyond the cities.
---
why does the image look so stretched out, you sure your not pulling our legs here with a photoshop
---
I still remember the moment in fo4 when I was working my way over a fallen highway and suddenly rapid fire laser shots starting landing all around me. I looked to my right and in the distance I saw the broken down building where the shots where coming from. And that was how I found my first, beloved gatling laser.
---
So despite you still using only a fraction os what everyone else takes to kill enemies you kicking up a stink about using 2 shots to kill something?  
---
The way you were saying about this damage nerf made me think it was taling you like a whole mag of something to kill a single enemy.  
---
And yeah "3x-5x" resources souns like a lot but when the number you staryed with was 1 there was literally no means in which this wouldnt have sounded bad if you had any increase at all, and you were using literally as few resources as is possible to use before, so even if everything across the board was 5x more expensive youd still be using half as much as most other people
---
Get me the Raider psycho-tic helm from fo3!
---
You know what - I've never even looked at their junk tab. Just ammo and notes.
---
Thanks for this tip. You've been a huge help.
---
Tap it don’t hold down. Get a running start.  Not great for elevator work. But great if u sprint and want to fly horizontal. Jump from a cliff or land from high up, and it is great.  
---
Secret service jet pack is my favorite thing in the entire game.
---
I use all the AP perks I can get...armour/perk parts etc.
---
I can fly for quite a while, and if you practice you can land like a bird.
---
👍🏻
---
&gt;Thirst and hunger meters are an integral part of fallout and other survival games.
---
By integral I assume you mean totally absent from 1-3, Tactics, Brotherhood of Steel, and optional game modes in both New Vegas and Fallout 4? That kind of integral?
---
What system are you on?
---
The exploding blood eagles in the vault felt easier for me since I run fireproof and vampires weapons for that one. 
---
This one was easy but a little more confusing to me since I honestly don't think I have ever been in the burning mine before. It's nice that daily ops take us to some less used locations for a little more variety, hopefully they add more locations in the future too.
---
Happens each log in with me
---
There are options for whatever weapon you want to use, if they chose not to take them I really don't want to see the 100th post with them bitching about "sponge" enemies.
---
Ok.  You get a super mega bonus for actually answering my question with reasonably sourced info.  If i knew the can of worms this post was going to turn into i'd have suffered in ignorant silence.
---
Thanks.
---
generally my perk is carry weight focused. anything that makes things lighter or directly increases carry.
---
other than that, Im a heavy charisma focused build (so I can share lvl 3 cards with newbies) and I do use lvl 3 vats targeting and maxed out cripple/recoil for my gun.
---
I suppose my build is "how much can I carry and how much can I help the rest of the team?"
---
I accept that Im not good at the game - but I enjoyed running around the cities and clearing them out.
---
You can move or delete the goo pile of guts if they won't fit anywhere, I won't be offended. Do you want me to keep an eye for any asylum outfits when I do my runs to collect them?
---
I completely agree. That being said, I know some people are still confused about how it all works. On day 1 of the update I was still behind the learning curve. I realized after my first attempt at a Daily Op my Bloody Stealth Sniper was not up for the task. So I spent several minutes checking my stash, re-equipping  armor, modding a different weapon, shuffling perk cards, getting rid of rads, managing carry weight issues, etc. By the time I was ready to go my team had already started and finished an Op. So I started another one and my team didn't join me. Oh well, I was kitted out that I could solo it if I had to. I get halfway through the Op, the phase where the more dangerous enemies start showing up and then THE TEAM LEADER BOOTS ME FROM THE TEAM. I am immediately ejected from the instance and I can't even go back to loot the bodies that I dropped for all the ammo and stimpacks that I invested.
---
So I learned that lesson the hard way. I just ask that people be a little more patient with players. This game doesn't have a tutorial or anything so it's entirely trial by fire.
---
Dude. I am AGREEING WITH YOUR POST against OP. That's why I remarked on and quoted what they say, not what you said ... I'm not whooshed here, so no need for rudeness.
---
Maybe your thinking of the regular ones, the ones that have 10+ going in a circle, that also has health regen, you can't reach them to get a box for a nuke keycard. They are across the bridge.
---
That was removed a while ago. There were a lot of people angry that it was. So unless they brought it back as a bug with this patch unknowingly, it shouldn't be happening.
---
Go to your camp, pop a spike board down on the ground stand on it and trigger it.
---
^ This, My shotgunner gets mad gains in shotgun shells in D ops. I can solo it every time so i just make a team for bonus xp.
---
By forever do you mean optional in both New Vegas and Fallout 4 and totally absent from earlier games?
---
That was a lot of thoughts
---
Did you read any part of my reply to you?
---
I already do use the one in the Gun Shop.
---
I'm just suggesting that if there's going to be a mission guidance, the one in The Core is probably the worst possible bench to point to.
---
Be careful. You've just made yourself a possible target for any griefers that might be out there wanting to destroy your camp.
---
If dual pistols were a thing, I'd for sure do a build for it.
---
Well I only kept maxed version or lvl 1s,and about 5-6 lvl 2 I regularly swap.
---
Yes I lost many because I used to have every rank of many cards.
---
I'd like to hear how many coins could someone else at my level get,but it's bot easy.
---
Ah yeah been needing at least one been hoarding  the others I find for when we get mannequins.  :D
---
No but man oh man. If you max rank the new ammo legendary perk you will get so many ult cores from plasmas. Even before super duper hits you get 9 ult cores for 2 reg cores. So you should be loaded with them even with enemies not dropping them
---
Clearly you didn't read the post!  
---
Besides stuff from the Atom Store isn't taxed, you get EXACTLY what you pay for... They don't sell you 15x scrap kits and only give you 12x you get all 15
---
Yeah its nutty. Got 3000+ Shells in maybe 10 runs. +100 something stimpacks
---
I'll take exploding over freezing anyday. I did enjoy the stealth one yesterday. Best one they have had so far.
---
So, as others have said, this sounds like a complete failure of your graphics card. :(
---
Do you have integrated graphics available?  Most newer Intel processors include IntelHD graphics on the chip, and some motherboards also offer integrated graphics.  If you do, then you could try physically removing the (dead) graphics card, and connecting your monitor to the ports on your motherboard's I/O shield.
---
That will at least get you **a** screen to use, to make sure it's not something more serious, like your CPU being burnt out.
---
**WORD OF WARNING**: be careful putting your hands inside the case.  One tiny bit of static electricity can ruin everything.
---
On the back of your computer, near where the power cord connects, should be a little switch with O and I on it.  Switch it to O (Off).  Then, when you open the case, always keep your body completely grounded.  (Many computer supply stores sell wristbands that connect to the metal interior of your computer case with a cord, to do this easily for you.)
---
There's only a small chance of a static zap damaging your PC, but .... why take the chance if you don't have to, right?
---
Not entirely true. I’ve skidded by with BoS paint plan offers, Ammo, resources, caps, mediocre-good legendary drops, etc.
---
Oh well, thanks for the info tho. I know I had two offers the other day but I had to work so I never got to meet up with them
---
You've been lucky 🤷‍♂️
---
I have a large collection of pipe revolvers and running both rifle and pistol perks my quad can still 1 shot a mutant with a headshot from sneak, and any of the ones with primaries that add damage definitely do still. 
---
I had been a bit worried when they mentioned tank killer being applied to pistols they might change that the pipe revolvers get both sets of perks, glad they didn't :)
---
...thank you Wiley Coyote, I never would have thought of that. Off to try it right now.
---
Prepare to shit all over me and tell me how shitty of a player I am - I get it all the time.
---
I'm 175, non-bloodied full stealth build. My weapons (lever, fixer, HM, all tailored to sniping) were *barely* passable before, but *the best I could obtain since launch*, and now my build is a piece of shit.
---
I don't care about frequent one-shotting being off the table, but I *cannot* participate in the DailyOps, because every fucking day has been "oh, you're stealth? That's adorable". Can you fucking imagine the fallout &lt;...&gt; if DailyOps explicitly eliminated the bloodied builds like it does the stealth builds? This sub would fucking melt.
---
I LOVE the idea of DailyOps. I love that there are random mutations to make it harder, but for fuck's sake, you implement an unnecessary nerf *and* eliminate the viability of *an entire build class* on the same fucking day? Go eat shit.
---
Sadly I don't have many AP perks, and scrapped a lot of excess cards for Legendary points. :(
---
All right, I am gonna give it a shot (no pun intended), thank you!
---
Yes, some complaints are valid... some are just whiny b\*\*\*\*ing complaint posts.  Whats amazing is that there are \*still\* some bugs that exist that have been around since launch... hell... some have been around since Fallout 4...  That's crazy!  But... you can't say that Bethesda hasn't been listening to some of the complaints and adjusting the game for the players.   Even if the players are whiny, fickle little b\*\*\*\*es.
---
Because it's a Bethesda game. So they did it for one of their games and not another
---
Im my experience Skeet shooter lvl 3 only bumped my Pump shotguns accuracy by one point. Concentrated fire is only perception card i have
---
Hm, maybe I just need to get used to it. I tried some of that and it was either underwhelming or an outright failure. I jumped off a lookout, kicked in the jets half way down, and the fall still killed me.
---
This is it. I'm a full health VATS stealth sniper and I can swap to commando easily, but my perks are a combo that favors commando.
---
I use an instigating lever action and an instigating explosive Fixer. Lever action on most mobs and they die in 1-2 hits. I use my Fixer on anything tanky or if I'm overwhelmed.
---
I'm probably losing out on damage, but that damage doesn't seem to matter in most places, as I'm still 1 or 2 shotting most things. Tanky stuff I usually just have to be smart about and I can take it down (except major bosses).
---
This update made things a bit more challenging. I chew more ammo and repair stuff more. I have to think about my buffs now. It actually made the game more fun IMO.
---
I use the casual team all the time, even though i'm not grinding for xp, its just a nice bonus gaining that xp for free just by playing, I'm sure I have soloed in a casual team and got the benefits from "Herd Mentality" even though I was on my own.   
---
I understand the free fast travel point though, depending on where the rest of team camps are it could be really beneficial.
---
I think it just comes down to who trades in this game. I’ve noticed new players aren’t the ones that trade because it’s not a global trade network akin to SWTOR or other MMO’s. It’s kinda of a, “If you know, you know” mentality for it. Thus, everyone has most the stuff they want and what they don’t have is the ultra rare stuff. Kinda sucks but we make do. I’ll NEVER sniff a “B2525 Fixer” or any of that jumbo.
---
it flies behind your back and doesn't press against your armor
---
Do you have enough material to craft it?
---
I use this to fly to most locations, can even make it from my camp in Watoga over the savage divide to the rusty pick.
---
No more fast travel caps for greedy Todd anymore!
---
With some of these they use energy weapons as well so Shock absorption can even keep me from losing fusion cores for my PA
---
I am gonna look into this, thank you for the advice! I don't wanna waste your time having you to craft one and I would feel like cheating actually ;) Thank you very much though
---
Yeah, honestly. As someone relatively new to the trading aspect of the game, I had to reply on the kindness of others too get my best weapons, and then started trading with those. Expectations are way too high and it sucks for people new to this.
---
Which spot did you find yours in?
---
One cannot become a Scorchbeast Queen while wearing Scorchbeast Peasant couture. Of course that SB went to the Valley Galleria, it's where Appalachian fashion lives.
---
Meh. Personally, I think it’s important to pick your battles.This battle isn’t worth fighting.
---
I triple tap the VATS button as a work around to this with my vamps gauss shotty. In/out/in on the same mob then shoot seems to work much better than just pressing VATS once.
---
Welcome. For some reason some people really like opening their clunky pip-boy interface (or wasting slots of their favourites) to click Ionized Meat/Corn Soup that is taking up inventory space every ten-fifteen minutes as though that is somehow immersive.
---
Last night I got elder first try and got no rare reward but the first three days I would get the second tier finished first and then elder. Every day but the third day I got only one reward but the third day I got liquid courage for getting second tier and then the lovely vault 94 outfit plan for the third time. Guess Todd heard me trash talking getting that plan again and that’s why I didn’t get anything last night
---
I keep joining ops teams and then having people immediately start leaving.  I’m 231 with  SH PA and a gauss minigun.  I think we’ll be fine lol.
---
I didn't want to join until I had gotten all me shit scrapped and stashed, and I wasn't near my C.A.M.P. i had to get to my C.A.M.P., scrap and stash, and by the time i did, daily ops was finished.
---
Essentially, I don't trust people not to take my shit when I doe (too many bad experiences), and if I can't move quickly in daily ops I'm of little use anyway.
---
Happened last night on PC in Adventure mode. I can test it again today.
---
Do you not have passive mode on?
---
If you're on PS4 I'd be happy to help you rebuild.
---
This comment is unintelligible. Can you elaborate?
---
Just give it more time and use. At first I was like “Oh. Okay.” But some I’ve had it for a month or two, it makes a big difference in traveling around. Jet pack with marsupial is awesome.
---
I confirm it's annoying to see this, sure that on male character it is not the same ?
---
Any player can take over a workshop no matter if you are in pacifist mode or not
---
For them to attack you base you must've engaged in a battle which mean they can kill you and destroy your base.
---
Yeah well I try to reason things out as best as I can. It all seemed pertinent. There's more I could say but was trying to stick to the main points lol
---
I usually run it a couple dozen times for scrip.
---
Yeah more then enough
---
Ap refresh armour, as many as you can get. This helps a lot!
---
Edit. Use the perks you saved to get goat legs. You'll thank me later.
---
I spent the 1st day moaning and bitching about bullets as a low level and running out of ammo. Then i “cheated” and went on Nexus and found a mod that highlights trash by category; lead, acid...cloth. Holy shit the trash was hiding in the dark. I have tons of mats now for bullets and I dont even have ammo factory, or those ammo perk cards you guys talk about.
---
People did the same with event teams during the last patch. They'd never do any events either.
---
The game is balanced around taking damage perks for at least your weapon, that's pretty much rpg 101. Even then I have no problem using weapons I dont have cards activated for, its just less efficient.
---
Just report them and hope for the best. That's all you can do.
---
I feel this. Got three items I’m looking for, for my niche builds. Not legacy, not even particularly good outside the exact build. You can only rarely get off meta items these days.
---
I use a Vampires weapon so never worry about stimpacks and healing in the Ops, as for ammo farming is it really that good? I use a Guass mini gun I can recover around 380-420 from the bodies and the final reward from each mission, but I use around 1000 to do it.
---
Do you already have one placed?  It shows a 0/1 or 1/1 as I recall.
---
It seems the whooosher has become the woooshee
---
That's a downer...pun intended. 😷
---
Once you go past a certain amount of downward force gravity takes over same with PA jetpacks
---
You could buy a TSE for 1000 caps because someone duped 50 of those TSE weapons.
---
Was berserker ever playable to begin with? Lol
---
Ideally you want conversation pro and con.....this was not it.
---
First of all I miss read your original post and thought you had a vamps auto grenade lol. Anyhoo, ran todays op and it used about 1/2  a bar of durability so not as bad as I thought. However, I had forget to put demo expert on so it should have been more. I found it was fine for fighting trash, especially when invisible, but the damage was a bit lacking on the boss fight.
---
 As a side note blowing corpses all over the place probably pissed off the rest of the team.
---
 I can confirm vamps 50 cals, even without explosive, are pretty awesome.
---
I joined several times throughout the day, but the teams also rotated several times throughout the day.
---
I got OP's point, but I was just pointing out how you can't just assume that people aren't doing the daily ops because they're lazy or whatever. There have been people in the comments who don't want to wait five minutes, much less the hour or so I was waiting between ops. (Long wait times aren't problem, as long as no one *honestly* expects you to just be sitting there and waiting for ops to start. People have other shit to do too.)
---
They contested the workshop when i tried to take it back and i died. That was the end of it, i thought. I had no issue with that bit. It was the petty destruction of a level 60's base that pissed me off the most
---
I don't think legendary perks should be something that makes a weapon viable. Weapons should be viable from the get go.
---
Didn't know passive mode existed, and nah on PC. Thanks for the offer though
---
THIS. Goddamn its terrible today! Im hitting targets from a distance trying for sneak kills. Fucking doesn’t even register the hit even though im within range.
---
Yes. Daily.
---
In most cases I found myself unable to FP is because there was a mob near me that was preventing me from porting. Maybe cause I was using Escape Artist and that would put me from \[DANGER\] to \[HIDDEN\] even if I were targeted. But all I had to do was to kill any mobs near me and now I can FP at will.
---
So it will stay in Burning Mine for the rest of today? Until 12pm EST I imagine?
---
Bit late now, i alt f4ed the game and just walked away before i broke something (have somewhat of a bad temper/short fuse)
---
Personally, I think if they were adding a weight reduction perk into the legendary, it should cover all weapons. So you can drop the ones we have and use other normal perks instead.
---
Just hip fire only, ads is left hand attack and attack is right hand, could make it so you have to level it up to more pistols and melee and maybe even use double two handers in PA
---
I wonder now actually! I think, especially after the disastrous release of that game, most casual gamer might have left now about two years down the line. I might just not be part of the bulk having waited for one and a half year for them to fix their game with Wastelanders before commencing to play
---
50+ really. Only just relapsed I cana craft it but need to farm lol. So buying for now.
---
Nope, because most of us stash before looting. It's just asking for trouble the other way around.
---
No not only legendary... Make it an option from start, as normal perk cards
---
This. Pistols are fucking useless right now.
---
I think you mean Junkies!
---
Yeah, true. Either one would be great.
---
Currently 1pm EST with plans to move it to 12pm like everything else.
---
Should change in 1 hour and 2 minutes I think.
---
Hi, have you tried with alt+enter?
---
Yeah using it for the invisible enemies is a good idea! I might have to bring it out later and destroy some invisible blood Eagles lol
---
That might actually be a better solution than spending perks, as I can shove it in my stash when not using it. Thanks.
---
You can change or just delete your fallout76.ini under 'user\"yourusername"\documents\my games\fallout 76\'
---
0/1
---
a tad squishier coz the average enemy level you're facing has risen. if the damage reduction would've gone, bellieve me, that shit wouldnt go unnoticed
---
I was using BoS combat armour until I upgraded to the Secret Service (for gold bullion from Regs in Vault 97). As mentioned it doesn't need Ballistic fibre to repair. 
---
The thing that will make quite a difference to you if you are not using it already is White Knight (AGI). I only equip that when repairing armour, along with Fix It Good which will repair to 200% when maxxed out.
---
Does it share a spot with the scrap bot thing
---
They take abit of skill and a few deaths for me. Running a bloodied commando lol.
---
Still managed to get paladin solo on my first time through this one.
---
I got to almost L300 and could tank a sheepsquatch with my toon. What do you think?
---
I just rolled forever with mumbles until I got an unyielding ap set. The difference between my main that has 5 pieces and my alt that has 1 is huge!
---
Double whammy.
---
Daily ops + Legendary Run.
---
Honestly, I'd be extremely hesitant to get rid of Fireproof. I'm using Rank 2 Fireproof with Asbestos torso mod, and that covers me for ACP and SBQ. SBQ is fixed so she can be crippled again, and just in time for the Improved Repair Kits to be needed. Plus a lot of grenades and grenade launchers in Daily Ops to protect against. Rank 2 is fine, but I definitely wouldnt go lower than that. I mean, even if the Legendary Perk that protects against fire is equal to rank 2 Fireproof and Asbestos torso mod, is it really worth a slot that could be getting you 5 special points? I dunno.. But Funky Duds is, without a doubt.
---
From my testing, I don't think AOE kills from Hack And Slash can trigger Grim Reaper's Sprint, and Lone Wanderer is now redundant unless you exclusively intend to solo Daily Ops. I gave up on my melee for now, until they make some adjustments based on the ~~beta~~ live server feedback. Bloodied unarmed melee is basically forced to use Ricochet and Vampire's weapon as a crutch. And I with Take One For The Team, it stops Tenderiser and Suppressor from working (bug) so it really is just a mess. You can't strike a balance and it all just ends up hinging on Ricochet and an off-hand Vampire's weapon. Vats Fu never procs cos of the miniscule range for melee, so Hack And Slash and Exploding Palm usually leaved me being attacked as i adjust my camera back down from staring at flying corpses in the sky.. So yeah.. that can go sot in the nerf corner until corrective actions are taken. Much work to be done before it is not only viable, but enjoyable. It's just not there atm.
---
And in regards to swapping Uny out for other pieces just be wary that you will be losing out on the AP that you are now very dependent on. Might be worth getting rid of Grounded to make up for it tbh. At least ranged has the "25% Less AP" roll to mitigate, so atm i'm only running rank 1 Grim Realer's Sprint as a stopgap.
---
Ah man can't wait to legit get me these plans, lotta potential for some mad science scenes with merging stuff inside.  
---
If you keep it off to the sides enough ot doesn't interfere with its usage.
---
Bethesda has it on eso though so they obviously know how to implement it and get it to work
---
Had one drop from ACP last night that finally was a bloodied (magic as well, though I would still be using it regardless) and feeling that pain now.  Luckily I have enough scrap stored to keep it fed for quite a while.  Still can't decide rather I want to spend perk coins on ammo factory though.  Even at one star, crafting batches of 40 is rough coming from 50 cal which is something like 240 per batch now with the card.
---
Station vendors will have it for sale as bulk (10). Usually one each. Coat is around 300 caps depending on your Hard Bargain perk.
---
How does this happen?, I kill 1 enemy and I get 4-12, 2mm on his body, if I get any at all.
---
I believe it could be alot to implement, but it already was like this in skyrim, like what I mean is dont they litterally have the technology to do it? 
---
AR user here, but I think it would be cool to let people have this choice
---
I’m an exclusively ADS/Chinese Stealth Armor sniper since FO3. It’s likely that the sentinel armor is in fact what was happening, so I may need to brush up on my armor game in this fallout.
---
Why are QOL perks even in the game then? Because Bethesda sucks at balancing (and pretty much everything else besides storytelling.
---
Thank you! That does let me reopen the game when it stops working, now to figure out how to get it to run correctly.
---
Some have hundredss of thousands.
---
I'm kinda already set lol, 
---
Pirate hat check, 
---
Hunters longcoat for a sailors look check,
---
Eye patch check,
---
hmm could a Sabre count as a dirk?
---
12 Black Powder weapons check check check check check check check check check check check check, 
---
(I just don't understand WHY I keep getting legendary Black Powder weapons, pistols, rifles, blunderbusts).
---
Still just thinking of the many weapons reminds me of that templars line in AC:IV BF, Julian: I once fought beside a man who carried nine on his person. They were a boon in battle but hindered his ability to swim, sadly.
---
Well no drowning in Fo76 but you can still cause a lot of damage with a full wheel of them, but bring on the dual wielding. 
---
Say maybe putting two together could form a set and make you have 24 weapons ready over just 12 or is that a wee bit to much?
---
This makes me so upset. That event was my favorite by far in this game! None of the other events are even half as fun! This event literally brought the entire server together every time! Come on devs, please for the love of enclave, do better!
---
I think you could get the same damage % with junkies and a full set of armor and high dr.
---
nah, the only time consuming thing there was is the necessity finishing each robot with a bash. other than that, if you know the route, there would be no problem
---
Hey. This new outfit can work as an opportunity for new players/traders. There is no way you can farm for b/25/25 fixers but you can farm those outfits and plans that someone would offer legacies for. I know it can be frustrating for veteran traders but we have to think of these newcomers
---
Did u get neurotic dust?
---
It's very funny with friends now
---
I rock the exact same build; I just get frustrated by NPCs in low area before level 1 now level 28 requiring me to spend a ton of ammo and time and, eventually, stimpack.
---
I just preferred having low-level areas alongside high-level areas so that I could choose between casual or demanding gaming. Now everything is just slightly difficult and there is no contrast of difficulty to enjoy.
---
Besides, with all that amo and stimpack, it is rather expensive to combat so I just keep running
---
First I was not “kicking up a stink” I am participating in a discussion online. 
---
I paid my dues, I had to buy my lever gun around level 90. I grinded bullion and made my other weapons and I had to make about thirty to get good rolls. I have to farm nukes for my ammo. I have earned all the perks to maximize all those weapons. It has taken me years of playing a few hours almost everyday since beta. I am a dad of a little kid, the time I have is precious. It is fair for me to be displeased about changes that devalue my investment. 
---
Are other people more affected? Yes. Have I been affected as well? Yes. Whataboutisms are not really a fair response here. If bad things happen to people disproportionally it does not undo the damage just cause it’s less so. For example let’s say both our grandmothers get the same kind of cancer, my grandmother is bed ridden and yours is not. It would not be acceptable for the doctor to tell your grandmother to get over it cause others have it worse. Another example would be telling a Latino person they can’t be upset about racism cause black people have it worse. Things can happen, people are allowed to not like it.  Don’t gatekeep people. 
---
Most importantly is it’s a game I still enjoy, play and love.
---
I used to have the healing factor mutation, but i got rid of it, it fucks too much with the other chems im using.  
---
I mainly use purified water outside of combat to heal myself.
---
It's that or any healing effects most of the time, any from healing factor to purified water can cause it.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
I recently started my SS armor: got a health regen piece, chameleon piece and a zealot’s mostly for the 20% weapons reduced weight. As soon as I have a full set I’ll start working on perfecting it. Pretty content with the rolls so far.
---
I am Lvl 401.  PA/Heavy Gunner most of the time but can be Stealth or Melee since I have so many Perk Cards and weapons.  The last three months I have been playing as a Stealth Shotgunner with one of my five "magic" shotguns.  Running Riding Shotgun repeatedly for the Pepperoni Rolls.  Either in CSS or my full set of Buttressed  Vanguard's SS armor. I could one shot all dogs and non-legendary NPC's in VATS.  Now it is two  VATS shots which means I burn up action points and cannot kill off multiples as before in VATS. I used to be able to take out five Mongrels in VATS, now I am lucky to kill two.  I used to be able to kill Deathclaws at NAR Repair Yard with one shot now it is multiple and am being killed by Lvl 100 Deathclaws with one swat. On silo runs I could one shot all Assaultrons, including 3\* Legendaries.  Now it is multiple shots and now wear my full set of Buttressed troubleshooters SS armor instead of sneaking in CSS.  The only improvement has been at Scorched Earth where my regular weapon, Prime AA Gatling Plasma, has seen a 20% -90% increase in hit point numbers with the same Perk Cards and drug set.  I have not noticed any change at all in ACP.  I would think it is now much more difficult for those in Lvl 50 to about 250 who do not have full sets of great armor or powerful weapons as they are facing max level enemies without high level armor or weaponry.  Legendary perk cards are also scarce for them. I am now immune to radiation and have increased three of my SPECIAL's by two levels and no longer have to use perk cards for lock picking or hacking.  Would hate to be  playing at Lvl 100 these days.
---
I have 40 of each flux 80 repair kits all windingo plans. I don’t need to run them both at all anymore.
---
It was on the store a month ago, the raider quack outfit, keep an eye out and itll probably come back around on sale
---
No it does not.
---
I have only ever met one 4chan user irl and he was a smelly weirdo that bragged about reposting the infamous Grow Your Own Crystals “Prank”. He was truly a disgusting piece of shit and I let him know it. The last I heard he was reprimanded by our college for poisoning another student with an allergen that he knew could put them in anaphylactic shock.
---
For plastic go to Morgantown highschool or watoga university. There is a lot of plastic there. Just a tip.😁
---
Depends on the weopon. I use shotty. One shot almost everything. Use maybe 100 Shells troughout the run. Then get the 4-12 per body and a Standard 200 Shells rewards at the end.
---
Oh cool. I play alone. None of my friends play it. I've been looking for people to play with
---
Alien blaster should be as they already have a 3* version of it as a quest reward
---
No. You can have a collectron bot and ammo converter at the same time.
---
When you sort the things you can build at the camp by the things you can build or unlocked does it still shows?
---
Things you can get from cash shop that are not yet unlock still show on the camp items listings but you can not build them, same for specific skins of items you can't craft.
---
Somehow I had a feeling something like this might be happening. My Bloodied Gauss rifle does ~1000 damage on a weak spot hit.
---
Perhaps the game and their user base are mature and I am just out of sync having waited for Wastelanders before starting
---
I think you're completely missing the point.
---
Have they taken out the thirst and hunger yet? I want to come back and try again, but the survival part sucks.
---
Sometimes I forget to leave when I'm in the middle of building etc. Sorry
---
they didnt do anything wrong..
---
I don't even get 200, 2mm at the end it floats around the 170-180 mark
---
&gt;Came back 10 mins later to try and take it back
---
theres your problem..
---
You damaged the axe he was using when you killed him, luckily he had a backup lead pipe in his pants...
---
I do pretty well with my be handmade, and extremely well with a be flamer.
---
Taking One for the Team is brand new mate
---
Might be lol. OPs point was that you should move on if you are gonna keep complaining about it,  but I thought no that's garbage.  Nothing is beyond critique, especially if it helps the game. The ones who already have up on the game have left the sub, the ones who want it to improve are still here
---
I've seen several posts on here stating fancy shotgun isn't dropping shotgun ammo.
---
I got be wrong around the 200 per. But its def not far off.
---
Something doesn't add up at all.
---
You have the foundation of a perfectly workable build. Hell, even some of my alt builds haven't got these kinds of resources and while I'm not having much of an issue people such as yourself seem not to be able to manage.
---
Maybe it's less about your gear but either the build itself or just your skill/playstyle. There's some obvious weaknesses to your build e.g. Sandman is too situational - it's dead weight half the time and bloody mess is nice enough if you can fit it but crit savvy is more important, especially with your auto assault rifle. Those crits would be coming thick and fast.
---
I'm not going to get into the "git gud" schtick. There's a clear divide in the player base that Bethesda needs to address. Skill or lack thereof isn't all of the issue.
---
One thing that baffles me though is what's the point of this post? Is it just complaining about the community and the current state of the game? Are you wanting advice on your build and gear since you devoted half the post on it? What are you hoping to get out of this post?
---
Thats when you break out the flushable wet wipes.
---
I feel like my tse mini gun is way underrated. I traded a bloodied something or other handmade for it and a tse .50 cal that’s meh.
---
Well, you will need to try to strike a balance. The best way to avoid dying is to kill things before they kill you, lol. At minimum you want to have the base damage perks for the weapon type you use, and you need to focus on one weapon type as your main source of damage output so you can keep other perk points available for the carry weight and charisma stuff. You will probably have to make some sacrifices on the carry weight focus to make your character more viable. Things like hacking and lock picking should only be equipped when doing those activities. Same goes for ammosmith, super duper, and your repair perks that let you repair above 100% durability.
---
I recommend the blocker perk in strength, especially if you find yourself getting swarmed by enemies. White Knight in agility makes armor break more slowly and reduces repair costs. Lucky break in Luck gives a chance that your armor will automatically repair itself.
---
This works if you have FO1st. The numbers needed for high level trades only work with a scrap box.
---
I actually rolled a secondary 20% weapons reduced weight on a SS armor piece yesterday.
---
The base crafted version (no legendary modules) is about equal to a super sledge; it has no inherent legendary effect like the fixer does. I ASSUME you can just get legendary versions, but I also ASSUME that like the Fixer, the sources of those legendary versions are very very few.
---
I came here to troubleshoot a computer, but the deed was done. Humans helping humans... gotta love it
---
Well that’s inevitable, you guys have waaaaaaayyyyyy more dupers.
---
It'll pick up again. The first few weeks of a season a lot of players will be focusing on getting as much of a head start as they can.
---
I run 3 - 5 per day
---
Had time for one run last night and missed it by 20 seconds because people ignored the first signal booster.  I had a mic trying to get them on it.  Stop killing adds after its done and move your ass to the next one lol.  If you dont know whats up bring a mic so you can ask at least.  Communication is always good for these things.
---
After learning that weapon condition is based on a 'per hit' basis instead of a 'per-shot', I'm convinced that most explosive weapons simply aren't viable, because you'll actively be punished for using them in their intended purpose.
---
They *can* deal decent damage, but they're woefully heavy with ammo and the weapon weight itself, and your weapon condition will absolutely be the limiting factor first if you're trying to aim for crowd control instead of precision, so you'll end up needing to repair quite often if your goal is hitting as many targets as possible at once.  
---
Things could change if they alter how weapons degrade their condition.  Why they made ranged weapons degrade on successful hit instead of per shot like in Fallout 3/NV, I'll never understand.  That works for melee weapons, but not for guns.
---
I thought that was when I’m supposed to find the other wedding crasher and get the hell out.  LMAO I love the movie Wedding Crashers.
---
The only reason people traded TSE handmades for caps was because of duping. They were pretty much the equivalent of B25 or BE back then as they were the most powerful weapons in the game. It was also harder to get caps as they only way to dupe them would be to dupe Nuka colas and spam drink them which could take hours, and you would end up losing a portion of the caps due to lag and other stuff. It was way easier for people to just dupe weapons and sell them for caps and use those caps to buy plans and resources because there weren’t as many in the economy, and caps were still a decent currency since the only way to dupe was tedious. Now that the presents got duped a while ago and caps have been coming into the economy constantly they’re not valuable anymore.
---
We can let Bethesda be the judge of that.
---
Yea, last two days have been easy. (sarcasm on) Can't wait for cloaked robots in the Burrows... (sarcasm off).
---
Oh well bud. For next time.
---
im on X1X went on the first time in almost a month last night and noticed that it was running A LOT smoother
---
Your point is that this update has rendered Berserkers useless. My point is that it didn’t really have a use before the patch anyway. You chose a pretty niche build there which was only ever really useable in stealth. I’d recommend you just adapt and go full armor with anti armor or junkies now, it really wouldn’t take much respeccing at all.
---
It’s the super reactor you get from daily ops
---
A possible reward from the daily ops
---
I left it and went and did my daily challenges. I didn't seek revenge or try and take it again. I died and respawned normally, and from what I've seen (i don't know everything about the game so don't crucify me if i'm wrong) just respawning and pretending it never happened just stops that pvp entirely. Also, when i came back to find them finishing off my base yeah i shot at them, but it did nothing, so by shooting i started the next pvp thing, they shot back and instakilled me (figures, lvl 400 vs 60). Again, i respawned normally, and stood there just thinking what the hell is his problem, he was next to me with that party emote thing, tried to shoot me again and i didn't shoot back so he couldn't kill me.
---
No, it would be destroyed on drop.
---
Even tho this sometimes work it still doesn’t fix the one where I have to re-open my map multiples times and click fast travel for it to finally work. Even Fast Traveling requires some form of grinding and it just tires me, really getting fed up.
---
Well, that's true, about stashing before looting.  I had one guy get me before I could FT out or stash tho.  :(
---
Insta kill flamers.....
---
Never got around to trying ricochet yet, how effective is it? Forget which tree it's even under, and whether I can afford to use it.
---
I haven't been having much trouble going as  bloodied melee. Initially I was dropping instantly,  but  I think I've found a good place for the now.i have a  vampires deathclaw but never got around to making it work for me pre patch. 
---
Grim reapers sprint has yet to ever proc for me yet so am considering dropping. Really trying to find ways to boost my AP for hack and slash and a medics explosive fixer I have. Tho haven't had much luck getting the hang of how to proc its healing effect. 
---
Didn't asbestos lining make you immune to fire damage? Or does that hinge on also having fireproof. 
---
Since the main 2 bosses dont deal alot of poison that hasn't been too big of a concern for me yet. 
---
Am using the perception,  intelligence,  and luck legendary perks for now, maxed hack and slash, aiming to max intelligence next,  then rank 1 ammo farm for now.
---
Will unlock my last legendary in about 11 levels, which I'll likely dedicate to agility.  Were there other legendaries that paired well with hack and slash?
---
McClintok is north of Wade Airport. It’s where you do basic training.
---
There’s several bags a duct tape inside the main building. Then check the barracks and the combat trains bunker and inside the tank.
---
Thanks i guess? The way it seems, it just seems like anyone can walk up to anyones base and just spam grenades and destroy everything without any repercussions
---
Almost shure it gets destroyed by dropping.. so no.
---
It never fails to get peoples attention 😅
---
This is why i can't play this game, I HATE the survival mechanics. I will be back the day they remove this.
---
I feel like i jump on to play and spend a ton of time dealing with this when i just want to play. Maybe they could at the very least calm it down a bit.
---
My only guess is that Playstation and Xbox have chat built in so they don't want to bother developing something just for PC. They also likely don't want to have to moderate that chat in anyway. Imo, likely a 100% cost cutting decision.
---
1. Remove all HP regen (healing factor mutation, tato salad, etc.)
---
2. Don't press too quickly on the fast travel button
---
Before that, I had this problem 95 % of the time, now it must be 5 % max.
---
Pretty much the same as the old pre-nerf heavy weapon meta. People keep thinking the nerf is targeted or it's going to shake up the meta. Neither is really true.
---
Only difference are explosive effects seem to do some work now so stuff like AAE and TSE stand out. Even without the demo perk.
---
I’m suprised with the hundreds of Mothman atom shop bundles there isn’t a dedicated quest line
---
Would be considered harassment, i didn't provoke them after they killed me defending their workshop and they decided to wipe out my base
---
Call down, Satan.
---
This happens to me when my power armor station isn’t in an accessible place - like if there’s not room behind it. Moving my power armor station into the middle of a room always fixes it
---
That was my thoughts exactly. There are a lot of interesting locations that we rarely visit. Its cool to have a reason to explore some of them. I would also like to see more daily ops locations added. 
---
As for the easiest so far, the freezing super mutants in valley galleria was the easiest for me so far. The mall is small and easy to get from one end to the other without getting lost. 
---
Ive mangaged to solo 3 with elder rank, and have got the valley galleria signs plan every time. Lol. Maybe it shouldn’t be called rare.
---
Damn, I’d like to get the desert ranger version of it. How about if I have a 1 month subscription to fo 1st will it dissappear from my inventory when the subscription is done ?
---
&gt;As of now, might as well just remove it from the game.
---
Like all of the other legendaries like nocturnal? Removing them doesn’t help the problem with them except making it easier to find the preferred legendaries from drops. 
---
After this calculation change I really hope that they go back and fix up or change the under performing legendaries.
---
Berserkers could be changed into increasing damage by 2.5% per str Or something like that.
---
Note : they did change assassins working on human NPC. I hope they take it a step further.
---
I'm so bummed that we can't dual weild
---
Nope. Only those that initiate PvP. The rest of us who don't participate don't have an issue aside from the odd bug or odd nuke.
---
This  please
---
Yes I run full health AAE 50 and AAE lmg and they rock
---
Weeeell... I'm not complaining earning 300 flux for BoS special ops suit just because it's new :p
---
I would have actually just scrapped it but I figured ppl are weird and would pay tons for that xd
---
I’ve found that there is a lot more Scorched Earths on the servers I’ve been on. Didn’t see much before the patch. Haven’t saw a single Colossal Problem since the patch.
---
No actually it does not as far as I know you keep it
---
So dumb question, did you buy the plan from a faction vendor and did you read said plan before attempting to build?
---
The rounds in your weapon are counted separately from your remaining ammo.
---
PC.  Didn't matter if I pressed the M or Esc key.  So far I haven't happen again.  \*knocks on wood\*
---
Well that's dumb. It had been nearly 30 mins. Neither of us were wanted, i could see them on the map, so there was no pvp at the time. I mean it's gone so not like i can do anything about it, just wondered why the hell that's a possibility
---
I have the settler wanderer if I want to hear the same song over and over and over and ov
---
It's almost like bethesda letting cheating go unpunished for two years is destructive for the economy...crazy thought
---
&gt;My point is that it didn’t really have a use before the patch anyway. You chose a pretty niche build there which was only ever really useable in stealth.
---
This right here proves you know nothing about the build. I went from L150-ish to L292 being a NON-stealth Commando and getting right up into the fray. I was actually dying less than my Bloodied counterparts who \*were\* stealth commandos.
---
I thought so too, way less enemies. Actually nobody shot at me for the first few minutes of beta. This was the first one I got elder on the first try and I was even on my unarmed guy.
---
I run PA so I thought the new perks were great
---
I completed season 1 with three to four weeks to spare. I didn't pay to rank up unless it was for one of the atoms rewards as it gave you as much as you spent so i treated them as free rank ups. Since i finished with several weeks to spare i'm not going to rank up for the atoms ones this time.
---
If you sub you keep the ranger outfit, however the desert  ranger version is no longer available.
---
They can't even manage reflex sights on the pump shotgun or the smg.
---
You know what I did when a guy nuked my base for shits n giggles?
---
I went and collected all the stuff I needed to repair it.
---
Then I kept playing the game.
---
Combine with marsupial and bird bones mutations plus Strange In Numbers for maximum effect.
---
In first person just have them lover the gun from view while ejecting the mag or swinging out the cylinder and then raise back up in view slamming in the mag or cylinder
---
I bought a set for 8 caps, if that tells you anything about its value.
---
Still better than "get good" though which is just taking a dump on new players. Those players don't even offer any advice.
---
&gt;didn't have pacifist turned on
---
That does make sense!  
---
But if my remaining ammo is 0... and the rounds in my weapon is 0... and I get 37 rounds as a quest reward, why was the total number of rounds before/after reloading equal to 32...  
---
AMMO TAX! :D
---
&gt; Like all of the other legendaries like nocturnal? Removing them doesn’t help the problem with them except making it easier to find the preferred legendaries from drops.
---
I was being slightly facetious.
---
And, with no armor or any synergistic perks, the *least* Bethesda could do to make Berserker viable is make the damage output higher than Bloodied.
---
There's still no end game (two eventy and grind dont' count, but i loved the game), they only gave the Ops. Scaling isn't content, it's just there to increase grind and time by killing you or just stretch combat. 
---
Raids, new campaigns, a whole new end game area, a whole new package of legendaries to grind, new world bosses, that would be content. 
---
Beth won't change much, because they don't care. See the old bugs in the game or missing features. 
---
I play with my wife since a week. I have a high level bloodied tank build, he hasn't much trouble, but needs more defense and resistances. But playing with the low level char is just stupid. There's no sense of progression and development. The point of leveling up and getting better gear is to be more powerful and that's now gone. 
---
If i doesn't had my high level char to equip our lowies, wo would quit. There's no good thing about scaling. 
---
It denies every development and there's no choice how to play. Befor the patch, i just could decide to farm in the forest and have a chilled day. Just doing a few events, get some mats, no annoying enemies, doing some daylies. And now i am forced to be around high level mobs everywhere. 
---
In that case, they could remove leveling complete and go the shitty way like Destiny 2.
---
yeah as a heavy gunner power armour build, there are enough good cards to fit my 4 slots.
---
I mean yeah i have to do that, but why is that allowed? You can't just walk up and murder someone unless they fight back, so why are they allowed to destroy a base
---
I'm sure it is. Most people are min / maxing at this point. At least the ones looking for trades like this.
---
I still have a TSE mini, handmade, pump, combat shotgun, and 10 mm. They're all pretty dam good. Even the 10mm sub shreds enemies.
---
I think I’m the only one that doesn’t care about trading lol
---
I joined an op and the dude did not do anything. So I just joined an op and he proceeds to kick me out. Not cool man.
---
Berkeley springs
---
Why 1 last season?
---
I did 2 NW challenges throughout the entirety of season one, took a week or two break from doing dailies, missed a few weeklies due to missed timing, and didn't play at all during the bonus exp week. NEVER grinded exp intentionally, only collected it while playing normally. Still finished with about 3 weeks to spare. This one will be piss easy, leveling is much faster for higher level characters and we already have more challenges than season 1 started with. We also have multiple score-related events lined up on the calendar. There is absolutely no reason to feel any pressure here unless you can only turn on your computer once a week
---
Hapers Ferry tried to raise the sales tax, and Wallace took his business elsewhere.  Gotta admire the principle!
---
So auto builds are better than semi I suppose. I need a bloodied auto then :|
---
Yeah, but like another said, they would have to redo the entire way ammo is kept track of if you could have a gun in your offhand. Granted, what I propose may be just as over intensive for coding, I dunno
---
&gt; Bethesda, please take down this patch and put it through proper QA. This is absurd. 
---
Yeah, that's never happening.
---
Good to know but it seems like it'd be worth carrying a few explosives around.
---
I guess a better question - does the xbox and pc version of FO76 have same output capability?
---
Fallout 1st made the trading harder, everyone wants 100k in flux in exchange for guns now!
---
I said this to A guy the other day and I’ll say it to u too. Hang in there. If u love the game that much you will find a way to adapt to the changes for now or taking  a break might be a good idea for little while. But Beth will def change things around because of the backlash. They have said a few times this is just the bases for future tweaking and they are far from finished. 
---
Now I kno their track record is spotty at best with this type of promise but with the amount of ppl having this much trouble I don’t see them not changing anything. I get it, it’s not the same game we’ve all been playing for the past 2 years. I have a few characters that are optimized so I don’t have as much trouble as some with the update and just had to switch a few things around but I can see why you’re not happy with it. I’m a dad with one kid and a baby on the way myself , work 45-50 hrs a week and will forfeit sleep to get a lil more game time in after the fam is asleep. Not all can do that. 
---
 Try different things out , utilize the new legendary perks. Ask for help on here with what u can do with the build you have now or go on the trading sub to see if u can get better gear. Try to play on a public team more. I rarely even do the same thing as my team and forget I’m on one most days just for the buffs. I kno these aren’t perfect answers but if u really love the game you can still make it fun with a few changes and a lil help.
---
I’m level 150, fully upgraded ss armor and jet pack.
---
I have no issue getting caps, but I still find many reasons to spend them, they still have value, considering all the end game currency available that’s impressive
---
Its a glitch using exploding bait from what I understand.  
---
It sucks that people can do it but really at the end of the day it's so easy to bounce back in this game I don't get pissed about any of it.
---
I like the grphics,but would have liked them animated as well
---
I guess it just isn't becuase they had no idea how to balance it. Imagine a furious or Vampires chainsaw... 🤤
---
I got lucky and run with two tanks. One had the plasma caster. One had the gatling plasma and I had a 2 shot ultracite heavy gun. One was a lvl 30 and he was also super awesome. Got all three done in four runs. Who ever these guys where stellar job.
---
Can I see your full HP build? I'm considering switching to a ful HP one because I need to bulk up, I dont want to be one shotted by a level 100 mole rat anymore :(
---
I agree with you; the ammo consumption I am taking on now does not justify the better XP, as the loot is not better by any means. I have filed more events now as I run out of ammo and no one else on the server comes in to help, and these are the "easy" events. I hope they make it a setting that can be turned off.
---
Bloodied unarmed here - still viable. Did a little tweaking to perks like swapped QOL perks for incisor 3, popped a few melee legendary perks in. Still a nerf but not too bad - deathclaws and other huge enemies now take 6-10 punches instead of 2-3, and our west tek friends now take 1-3 instead of just 1.
---
I always join when someone starts one, it's when they kick me just as I'm joining is when it's annoying.
---
I was just thinking this. I thought with pacifist on you can "accidentally" hit players and it doesn't effect anything and pvp can't be started. So just shoot a lot and if 1 hits you get the weapon/junk on him.
---
Or was he just excited to see me?
---
This one was definitely easy, but so far the exploding bloodeqgles was my favorite
---
Oh really? Exploding bait? Huh.. well i mean it's a bug so i hope Bethesda will fix it so it doesn't happen again, eventually
---
We have what 10 weeks? After season one I was thinking on day one "must get all the score to keep pace" after 2 days already level 17 with a shitload of time left. Totally agree this one will be so easy.
---
Thats true, unless they did it Cod style, where its essentially one double barrel gun. 
---
But they've redone ammo systems before, with fusion cores and the like, so I'm sure it can be done.
---
Because pc market can just spawn in any Legendary whenever!
---
They could do what many games with dual wielding does , the weapons goes away , time passes , and its reloaded , it would only look really weird to someone looking to you
---
It's Bethesda's answer to parts of the community who ask for smaller generators to power their camps.
---
The update is great since I'm not that bored 1 shotting everything, its just that the damage drop was so bad that I had to use chems just to increase my damage a bit
---
It always had been sadly. Bethesda needs to look into addressing this issue by buffing or changing how damage is calculated with semi auto weapons.
---
I don't necessarily have an issue with auto weapons being the best but the gap between them is unreasonably wide.
---
Not planning to switch to full autos?
---
Also back then up to 5k caps was a lot to most players in those early days!
---
Just tagging /u/Valseek and /u/Ladydevann so that they see the state of things here.
---
And now it won't even load the are outside of the vault... welp time to nuke the settings!
---
The 8-pin cable was loose
---
Is the sneak damage modifier additive now? Shouldn’t it be x2.0 my base damage? So if I do 50 it should be 100 right?
---
Maybe if the trade off is the melee/grenade button would be how you aim it could work so you can still fire each pistol individually.
---
Also side note. Why all the downvotes, jeez
---
Fallout was built around using chainsaws?
---
Go Commando ;)
---
Where do you turn it off?
---
Or press option on playstation before the timer ends
---
Idk what to say except turn pacifist on and shoot it’s exposed area right between the 4 players. It’s impossible to cover the top portion of the area and Between their legs.
---
At least like this all it would do is melee the 4 guys surrounding it.
---
I like how we've been asking for passive perks specced differently since launch, and their solution all this time later is a legendary perk that replaces the six cards 😂
---
For real though. I was hoping it would emit power to the whole camp so you didn't have to run wires. But no, just a massive fusion generator
---
I was on a server the other day where there were three back to back Scorched Earths. I think it just depends what server you're on and when.
---
For me it's just ACP. I've seen considerably more SBQ. Probably because all those nukes have been directed away from ACP.
---
That means the card is either dead dead, or the psu doesn't give enough power anymore.
---
remove the gpu and try the onboard one, that should clear it up.
---
Prior to this patch you didn't need an optimized build.  It was actually called food builds on here and was a meme. 
---
Now you must optimize or you can't do the simplest of tasks.
---
the plans sometimes spawn in the train car between Watoga station and the train yard
---
turn on pacifist. 
---
also you didn't have grenades? any splash damage? you don't have marsupial to jump above them? SS jetpack to fly above them? PA jet pack? nothing? there are so many different ways around a few guys standing in a circle.
---
Ah yes, it could be a variety of things since the game is so buggy. Last time I could not load my main character, I created a new character and got that one out of the vault. Then I went back to my main character and it seemed to work again. Not sure it's a universal solution, but worth trying all the same. That and the mandatory 'verifying of game files' in steam or bethesda launcher...
---
Legacy bug mate.
---
So that's why there was a guy after scorched earth just going about killing everyone including me
---
Is the elite one still available
---
I’ve done this when I was level 20 some. I claimed a workshop and a level 100 plus dude it pa shows up solely to kick my ass and claim it. Then sends me a private message saying thanks. So I went and took it then hid. Did this for like 20 minutes watching him run around looking for me. Few random grenades here and there.
---
It helps if you read the obvious warning that your weapon will be permanently destroyed, but it’s your choice to do it anyways, and never your own fault.
---
Miss out on a 1* nocturnal rolling pin for an easy chance at a fixer plan, I'd take that over not finishing the event.
---
I can feel myself being mauled by super mutants everytime I sneak at West Tek. I haven't even tried a Whitespring yet :|
---
Sometimes things seem doom and gloom, but there is a good side to humanity! It just gets clouded by the bad stuff :)
---
Im feeling this one OP. Its my sneak is perfect the points just dont add up
---
I had three, tried to sell them for weeks because I found some awesome bloodied ones. Single star, I was asking 2K for them. Nobody wanted them. Ended up scripping all of them during a "cleaning rage" except the one I am using now. Single star, gets the job done. 
---
A hunting rifle might carry the same punch, so, buy one of those if you see one. I'll check my mules and give you one if I still have it. Ps4?
---
Eso by Bethesda has whisper, local, regional, guild, team, etc. 
---
They've implemented this all in their other game
---
Computer says no.
---
It’s cuz of the Taking one For the Team legendary perk. That’s what’s doin it. Put pacifist on for now if using the perk.
---
Well I think its time to camp at Purveyor Murmrgh's place and hope for a Bloodied auto.
---
Sounds like you weren't around in the days of the 400 pound stash space
---
I came across one of them yesterday for the first time, and was noticing how enormous the thing is. It should emit area power, as large as it is. Like, it should power the entire sphere your camp occupies.
---
Too hard for alot of ppl now.
---
All the food build folks can't do it.
---
I really wish ammo factory and one wasteland weren’t the same patch.  It would have been nice to stop being a hoarder for a week and not have to worry about ammo.  But it feels like ammo factory is absolutely required in order to even play at all with how spongey the mobs are now
---
I recently acquired a b/ff/fr lmg. Reload animation is almost non existent.  Ammo cost is a pain but worth. I thought my legacy gatling plasma was op but this is  very comparable.
---
More is always nice but 800 isn't that low dude. The problem is you poorly managing your stash. If you have 3 mules and you still have stash issues, it's definitely a you problem.
---
Learn to let go. You don't need most of what you're hoarding. Want, maybe, but not need.
---
Ya man, I totally agree. When caps was a thing I loved the trading market. BGS could help things out by giving us a new cap sink (legendary modules?) and nerfing the caps from those millions++ of duped Xmas gifts. Curious why they have allowed the gift dupers to keep swaggering around. They were quick to nerf the scrip from presents but allowed the caps to remain.
---
Yeppp, keep your pacifist on durring events or while at you camp at least. I enjoy a pvp every now and then but not survival mode style lol
---
For sure! I've done 9 so far. One solo took my 12 minutes. All other 8 I have done with a team and all under 7 min 15 seconds! Join a team and join ops. Easy awards and XP!
---
Thank you I forgot the name of the card!
---
Careful with Morgantown though, I went there today and the low level (50) scorched were all dead and I had level 60-75 Supermutants instead.  
---
The boss was nailing me with a minigun, when I killed him he had a Handmade rifle.  
---
This game can be really weird at times.
---
Thank you for the feedback. For starters, the point of the post was honestly more a straightening of my thoughts around the whole thing. And discussion from that if it sprang forth, which is why I am thankful for your response. I love the game. I was pretty disappointed in it last night. I know that it isn't a horrible build as like I pointed out the 2 shot did well still, just seems daunting that something I have put so much time into now is largely useless. I guess putting the so much of my gear and stats in was more of an "as information" tidbit, how things worked for me then and now.
---
As for the community, I wasn't even trying to complain about the community, just pointing it out. A lot of what I addressed up here has been brought up before. And it gets down voted every time. As this has been down voted, almost completely. I was trying for discussion more than anything. But it does seem like anything that doesn't fit in to the "pro bethesda" category gets down voted. In game, most by and large are quite helpful. I loved helping people out when I could. Here, it's hit or miss. People down vote for lack of understanding, or different play styles, or because they don't agree or misunderstand what was said. It's weird to me. But I see it happen.
---
As for the state of the game, yeah I was disappointed. I appreciate your advice on the critical savvy perk, maybe I will try that one soon. I've never really bothered with it before as I started out as stealth sniper and went for max damage reliably, not occasionally. 
---
Thanks again for the feedback. I genuinely do appreciate it.
---
Secret Service armor jacked things up a bit.  I don't really bother looking for armor pieces at vendors now because SS is really the big upgrade left.  
---
Weapons are a kind of sort of thing.  I have a pretty good set of guns so unless I want to try a new build, which I don't, there's not a lot of incentive for me to go looking.
---
Personally, when I go to vendors I'm looking for oddball plans I don't have - usually event drops.  Otherwise Nuka Cola and drugs at reasonable prices.  .45 ammo as well - I decided not to get ammo factory because I'm figuring the market will be flooded soon enough from everybody else.  Only need to find one vendor with 1k rounds or so to stock up for a while anyway.  
---
Adding lunch boxes for bullion was a good choice - if they removed Smiley's gold cap they could probably pull a lot of caps out of the economy.
---
One key thing is having two pieces of legendary armor with the 50% reduced fall damage perks. It negates fall damage entirely. Don’t go with one piece like that, goat legs, or any other combos. Two pieces of armor with that perk are a game changer. You can fly completely across the map with the right setup and never come close to dying
---
Umm I'm not talking about stockpiling junk but okay.
---
Hey look, it's an example of the exact kind of idiot I was talking about.
---
Let me guess, you're sitting on a rant about how it should be possible to have an unlimited stash because the scrap box exists?
---
That was a rhetorical question by the way, I really couldn't give a shit what excuse you're going to come up with.
---
Best lvl 1 legendary perk for me at least.  Got rid of multiple food/water perks and stopped hording disease cures...big QoL there...some ppl love making recipes with a little bonus, but I'd rather engage with enemies than hunt for a rare ingredient.
---
sounds like you might be hoarding way too much useless crap yo
---
Are you on PC?
---
What are the benefits of being on an ops team?  Why don’t we just do an events/ops team?  Sorry if it’s a dumb question but I honestly don’t look at the xp stat calculations when I’m playing .
---
I’ve seen more SBQ than colossal problem queen is easy mode now since you can cripple the wings and put her on the ground. All of the CPs I’ve done have been horrible. Low levels and having to do all the damage myself (very costly ammo wise). Add to that the fact that the daily ops are easier and similar in reward and you have our current situation.
---
This sounds like fairytale, you can’t just surround him and prevent others from hitting him, he moves fast and also head-butts if you get close, it’s often one hit kill. I’d love to see vid of such achievement. And the PVP ‘glitch’, if someone has pacifist off, he’s ready to kill others so he kinda asked for it.
---
My mistake, what were you talking about?
---
Yeah I’m on PC
---
It would be silly to go to a duel NOT wielding a pistol, I say.
---
Isn’t saying “Fallout 76 bad” also an echo though?
---
In fact one I have been hearing for almost 2 years
---
Push the button by the vault door?
---
Well yeah.  This patch crushed build diversity down to a few small pools.
---
Ironically what some ppl thought this patch would do (bring meta inline with other builds) did the opposite. 
---
I'm sure bethesda sees it but their patch schedule is a joke.  
---
Maybe by halloween we'll get another adjustment.
---
Gotta have dodgy, and enough ap to feed it, with unarmed melee; therefore, hack &amp; slash is pointless for this build. However, it will work great for 2-handed pa'd (tank) toons.
---
I've had more success running daily up missions with the full team in casual than I have in daily ops. Like why join daily ops if you're not going to play? lul
---
It's true that endgame is lacking and this is why opening the whole map to high level players was much needed.
---
Real new content is still needed and I am afraid that Brohood ain't true endgame content either. 
---
But fix to low level scaling is probably coming(someone here commented that Beth has already said so), because they can't lock new players outside.
---
Oh fuck Destiny 2 by the way. Those fucking thieves.
---
Same place as the trapper armor skins I guess :(
---
Should probably delete this and post a bug report to Bethesda, a lot of people are going to see this and go around pvping.
---
Keep in mind your progress is somewhat frontloaded, you probably finished all the weeklies already and are effectively done for now. But even with just the dailies, you should get to 19-20 by Tuesday. Then ranking up will take longer because of the increasing score required. Yes though, the progress everybody is getting right now is definitely far more than "on track"
---
Remember when scorched could use dropped weapons? Good times...
---
Cheers for telling everyone exactly how to do it.
---
Agreed
---
Why the hell do people down vote this?  I mean it's a legitimate reason to not run those events. 
---
This sub should just change its name to r/downvote
---
According to "my math" you need to earn a total of 223,750 S.C.O.R.E. to get to Rank 100.
---
Completing all the weeklies will give you 100,000 S.C.O.R.E.
---
Completing only 30 days of dailies (not including Double Score or Double Dailies events) will give you 67,500 S.C.O.R.E.
---
That will get you up to about rank 82 (this doesn't count the repeatable XP S.C.O.R.E. which may push you up a couple more ranks)
---
It will leave 56,250 remaining or 1,875 left per day that you play (assuming you're only playing 3 out of 7 days a week) that you'll need to make up via the repeatable.
---
If you managed to sneak in an extra day, you'd only need to hit the repeatable 8 times each day you play instead of 18.
---
So... there you go.  I think someone calculated that you can miss like 15 days or so and be okay.  Missing 40 days will require a little bit more effort.  Any Double Score weekend or extra Daily events will obviously change "my math", but this hopefully gives you a baseline idea.
---
I wouldn't stress out about the S.C.O.R.E., just enjoy your 3 days and have fun.
---
Omg, theres a button?? Forgive me for my idiocy
---
I got 2 simptomatic at once. Rare category was displaying nothing.. looks bugged
---
I disagree to some extent. My level 36 character had a level 245 character come into my camp, kill me and then destroyed my camp. He had a camp on Whitespring golf course with all the cool guys. Took me an hour of collecting wood to rebuild. Within 30 minutes of rebuilding he came back and killed me again and destroyed camp again. Not on the water and not in a spot that was near any vendors or workshops, just grieving. Had to switch servers.
---
Think durability damage needs changed completely into shots fired instead of hits made. That's why things break terribly. 
---
Also, we can't get a Blunderbuss that is Legendary yet. The Blunderbuss needs converted to a full shotgun, because currently it doesn't function like one. It's a less accurate Blackpowder Pistol with 1 projectile.
---
Ops team gives you 25% more experience for completing the Op per player on the team, so 4 team members gives you 100% more experience, so if your going to do it it is better in the special team and then swap to a different type of team when you finish.  
---
Edit\* I stand to be corrected on this as I don't know for certain, but I don't believe Daily Ops is an event so you wont get the Event team bonus doing it.
---
Agreed!
---
Bound to be bugs associated with it.
---
You go into photo mode then you crash after a couple of seconds. You log back in and there’s now no PA in your inventory.
---
The length is good enough for photo mode. at least to me.
---
I like the stein because I'm a digital Horder and I want it in my camp with the rest.😂😂😂😂
---
No prob, guy tried to do it to me while I was at my camp weapons workbench. Didn’t work cuz at the time I wasn’t on a team. I ended up killing him cuz he was lol. But yea players should know about this.
---
Hey level 135 here I also have full unyielding ss armor and a B2525 fixer but I don’t think I’m doing it right, do you have a nukes and dragons link or something I could use? Sorry if I’m being a bother
---
Okay but imagine you come back, everything is locked up tight like you left it, and there's just a loot bag in your locked off parts containing "you have been insulted!"
---
didnt all the duping glitches get patched tho?or is there sum shit im missin 👀
---
Unfortunately not sorry. Just the standard one right now.
---
 Not the case at all, I just tried to destroy a dudes camp because his prices were ridiculous but I couldn’t do any damage at all
---
If you get elder first try the chances are:
---
No plan - 17.1%
---
One plan only - 71.2 %
---
Two plans only - 11.3%
---
Three plans - 0.4%
---
How to do it and how to prevent it. There are two kinds of players in Fo76 after all. Besides a quick Google will take you to the YouTube videos on how its done. Took about 3 minutes of searching to find it.
---
Have done this, can confirm!
---
Suppressed gauss pistol and a plasma flamer pistol.
---
And yeah, all of it in agility sucks. I just run shadowed/HTD gear instead of sneak cards.
---
All three gunslingers and covert operative at max, escape artist, and thru hiker 2.
---
In perception, crack shot and tank killer at max.
---
Bloodied and Rambo playstyle aren't necessarily considered a good combination
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itcdkn/bethesda_is_electric_absorption_legendary_perk/g5dht2s/?context=10000
---
yup
---
Me and my buddy create a daily ops team and stay in it for the session. If a random jumps in the team and starts the daily op we run it with them.
---
We get quite a few low levels jump in and start the daily ops so it's nice to help out the newer or struggling players get elder.
---
Me too, still having fun😁
---
It would free up some agility points to put into damage mitigation. Other than that just start hosing things down. Maybe not the most effect  build but would be fun.
---
Yeah, there's a console at the bottom of the ramp to the door.
---
Knowledge is half the battle. Hopefully this gets a hotfix in the next couple of weeks since its a big QoL bug.
---
Just ppl exploiting bugs.
---
Don't expect any sympathy though.  This community doesn't really care much about bug exploits.
---
Well I have to concider getting the 1 month subscribtion, thank you for your help
---
The more you question down votes the more insane you’ll get.
---
Hah! Right??
---
I'm fine with it. I never really go all in on damage+ perks, so the legendary perks that increase game QOL are wayore enticing to me.
---
But the passive skill rework would be cool too.
---
What the hell was Bethesda thinking when they decided to do an across the board nerf without adjusting perk cards and base weapon damages first?  Every last perk card should have been tweaked including clear explanations and every last weapon adjusted before changing a major damage formula like that.  PTS players reported how shitty this was during testing but Bethesda gave zero fucks.
---
Seriously, what they did almost seems like a playground move.
---
I dont mind popping ONE aid item when I'm low. Survival shortcut is a dream. I think it's actually too cheap. At lvl 50, you can get rank 1 which is all you really need.
---
It's extreme MMO logic. I remember even WoW hung a lampshade on it during a quest being like "Weird, not all of these are carrying \[quest item that realistically they all would have\]"
---
I'm fairly certain the first criteria the game checks is to see if the molerats on the road outside of Blackwater Mine are alive before you load in.
---
Yes I think Ber deserves higher damage buff than Bloodied. It’s hard enough to fight without armor, then the little damage buff simply can’t justify using it, might as well pick up a TSE or AAE and run around naked instead.
---
It's a Daily Ops reward, but I'm not crossing my fingers to win the plan. Needing 4 foundation squares vs just 1 for the standard Fusion Generator is a joke. The only thing that gets that much space in my camp is my Brahmin and even the she has to share with the Chickens.
---
People just need to start using mics and communicating with each other.  Other people may like it’s set up when they group up with their friends for whatever reason.  Just make a team and if they don’t do anything kick them
---
This is how groups have always been my friend. Make a new group or change worlds and move on.
---
*Interpretive dance intensifies*
---
Yes crazy

[AVENGE ME BROTHER! AVENGE ME!](https://youtu.be/xrJVZZLv2GE)
---
Rare or just unlucky?
---
Meh. Let people do what they want to do. Sometimes they just don’t notice that someone started. Sometimes they have already done the ops multiple times and are just in the group to stay connected with the same people. Sometimes they are just looking for any group so they can get team bonuses. If the group isn’t doing daily ops then start a new daily ops group. Then as the leader you can kick people who don’t play the ops. There doesn’t have to be a rule or timer to solve every social issue.
---
You can still make your special food. This just helps those that dont want to constantly worry about it. Since the dmg nerf requires more ammo and shooting, making food all the time would be brutal. At least for me.
---
Not having to spend a minute switching out the equivalent of 6 cards every time makes it worth the slot even at one star. I love it.
---
Yeah. And it's true
---
I'm not locking the door to keep people out. I mostly got fed up of allies leaving the door open all the time to go upstairs: they teleport up instead now.
---
And if they are glitching through the door to be nosy they won't feel the need to open the door lol.
---
I don't want to be griefed by someone who just wants my CAMP spot.
---
Ahh an altruistic reason I can firmly get behind.  
---
The team leader of the first Daily Op I joined was doing exactly the same thing, he gave us the talk, told us what to do and how to do it, then showed us the way and we ran it a couple of times until we got the Eldar reward, after which we left the team and he took more new players through it, can't thank the guy enough I think I was on his 23rd run through the Ops lol.
---
BTW...tying damage output for Berserker to STR is, honestly, a terrible idea. It would basically lock Berserkers into being only Heavy Gunner, Shotgunner, or Melee. Anything else is out the window because of the need to have high PER or AGL.
---
For the toon in question, I was running 15 PER and 2 STR as a commando. Damage output is tied to DR like Bloodied damage is tied to health. It just needs a boost to  something like 150% - 200% dmg at 0 DR.
---
&gt; But it does seem like anything that doesn't fit in to the "pro bethesda" category gets down voted. 
---
I get that you might be in a certain head space but that's not really the case. 
---
A whole new sub was created to cater to those that were Bethesda apologists, sycophants and those that just aren't into criticism (legit or otherwise), negativity and drama, and only want to be ultra positive, even when the situation sometimes doesn't warrant it. This is considerably less pro Bethesda that it use to be, if you can even believe that.
---
If you're serious about feedback and possibly adapting your build, post it up sometime and see what kind of feedback you can get. Like I said, you seem to have a solid foundation. It might just be a few minor tweaks that could make all the difference.
---
If you have access to a second account to transfer things, someone made a suggestion in another thread about having a character dedicated to making ammo.
---
That character would focus on maxing out ammo perks and make the ammo and transfer it to the other characters.
---
Now this does require having a reliable way to move the ammo once made.
---
Some games get it right, like the forest, it made sense and was handled decently.
---
Here in fallout it just makes me feel stupid.  My character has never had to stop to drop a deuce or passed out from spending 155 levels sleep free, but i have to keep shoveling food and drink into my gullet.  In a game with a giant, mutated, sheep/porcupine/who knows what hybrid.
---
That happened only when duping involved dumping caps to vendors. Even then, most tses went for 10k+
---
Hmm, never noticed. It seems fine on my 2 female chars.
---
Thanks man. Honestly thank you. I know it's different. I know I just need to change some things around. But really yeah, I think I do need to just take a temporary break. I really do love fallout. I definitely don't want to give up on it but by the same token it's meant to relax me not stress me out more lol. Thanks again for the response. I would upvote it more than once if I could just for the positivity in it.
---
I have but not to verify. Just happened organically.
---
What do you want to talk about?
---
Berserker needs an armor set like weightless working for it. Also should be the top DPS because of its fragile health.
---
2666mhz dual channel
---
Get em tiger
---
ya its hard, legendary perk "what rads" are a game changer tho early on
---
Yeah ppl have. 
---
But a veteran player isn't a casual player so it doesn't really matter.
---
Ah ok, thanks for the info!
---
This pisses me off !!! Also
---
I already have a post started !
---
I'd rather that Bethesda kept trying on all the available servers in the region until you run out of options or the wait timer seems to long to prompt you to either keep looking or just accept the next world.
---
Why jump on a roof when you can just circle-strafe around a car and destroy its ai pathing without that meaning that it runs away trying to find a new bizarre route to you
---
Oldest trick in the book
---
Nothing special to look at...all toons look the same.
---
Yes we need that badly!!! 
---
Glad they added pistols to the Tank Killer perk :).    For some reason though my pistol breaks within five mins of fighting now even with Gunsmith at 4
---
Well son of a bitch. Thank you. I haven't done much vault exploration and fallout 4 you just enter the vault through the elevator and I haven't done any vault explorations in 76 so I wasn't aware there was a button to get in
---
Ive been wanting text chat since beta. I'm with you brother.
---
If they had some way of chatting in game I mean I have a mic but you never hear anyone talking
---
Nah they drop their spare weapons. If you do limb damage or kill them in then right way they drop their in hand weapon and their corpse still has another weapon. I've also found that if you kill a super mutant with a mini gun, other super mutants pick it up but it doesn't disappear from the first ones inventory. Then you break limbs on the new one and he'll drop the minigun and you can get a bunch of them that way if you take the time to do it. My concern has always been the ammo part of it. How can enemies shoot at us for days but we only ever get like max 12 rounds off their body?
---
Because Bethesda hates the mute and shy people
---
cuz they suck dont nobody wanna spend thousands of rounds jus to get an exterminators pipe rifle
---
Just curious to know if someone who knows the ins and outs of the game can rough through the earlier levels. If that’s the case then maybe it is.
---
My character inventory weight is increasing 100.  So when I put on the armor instead of losing 10, I gained 100 inventory weight. Frustrating!
---
I did and its not, leveling is much easier and it's less boring
---
Spend hours making a house with a nice roof to protect me from the elements.
---
Everything inside is shiny
---
Any other groups I absolutely agree but daily ops is goal orientated so makes no sense to have said group with no intention of said goal. Just use any other group for perks etc.
---
I mean to me berserker feels like it should be associated to str and or melee. It would allow melee players that don’t want bloodied able to get to at least 60 to 75% damage increase without the need to be naked.
---
I mean they could change other skills like nocturnal increasing damage as much as bloodied/berserker but only during the night. You would miss out on nerd rage and adrenal reaction though.
---
There is quite a bit they can do but refuse to do or look at.
---
If it was me modifying nocturnal I would change its name then increase the damage at night and give some sort of buff during the day.
---
I really like this! The thorn armor should have a mod that highlights collectable flora.
---
Check out the Video Angry Turtle did yesterday, it’s his Run and gun daily ops build for his stealth commando..no stealth
---
Possibly? I play on PC and Xbox One X—1080 &amp; 4K HDR (even if it’s fake 4KHDR) respectively. My gameplay is much smoother and higher frame rate on PC, but the game looks better on the One X. I’d imagine that the new Xbox will improve on that, at least the frame rate part.
---
I can craft those on XB, one one of my characters - just have to figure out which one. I found the plans in the two spots outside of Watoga, the train car and the barracks building at NAR. They don't show up frequently.
---
I think you can actually buy those from some of the vendors, seems like Responders, maybe?
---
Text chat is a better solution, especially for those of us in regions with mixed languages. Kind of hard to communicate with a foreigner with a thick accent and has some anxiety about their ability to speak English vs being a little more comfortable behind a text interface.
---
Sadly, that's never happening though since it's just not a priority for Bethesda.
---
Yea I can relate with ur situation man. It’s not easy juggling life and gaming. In-between the seasons I was playing fallout 3 and the new outer worlds dlc and dealing with a crazy pregnant wife and 2yr old lol. Sometimes you just need that break to make the game feel fresh again. Hope u stick around but if not I hope u come back soon.
---
This may be just a cool idea to you, but like... I feel like this could be a genuine solution to pistols being so weak.
---
Like, a lot of pistol stuff involves hip fire accuracy, so with enough you wont even have to aim down sights and could dedicate the L2 trigger (or right click if thats what PC uses for sight aiming) to firing the second pistol.
---
Another thing that could fix pistols is if the team fixed vats but that's a whole other issue.
---
Still feeling burned that they reject me despite my full moth cult gear so I'm hoping for a better new sect of the cult so I can keep punishing these false believers
---
I
---
My characters are level :320, 90, 55, 42 and 15.
---
Because you can run daily ops once a day per character AND you only get a rare reward above lvl 50 , I'm in the process of leveling the last 2. I can confirm, it takes much longer. On the other hand the main character massacre so much level 100 enemies that it get one or 2 level a day now... bottom line : the Game is getting better for veterans.
---
Booo. Hiss
---
I'm a little shy of rank 20 just from regular play. The level scaling gave a huge xp buff and I'm constantly hitting the 10kxp weekly for 100 score at a time.
---
Not really. The major difference would just be swapping out stealth perks and damage for more survivability. So blocker, serendipity, ricochet are all good choices.
---
They've faked it, not actually done it. Making it look like you're duel wielding and an actual system for it are very different things.
---
Watch Angry Turtle's latest video and just disregard the stealth bits. He even said/demonstrated it's a decent run and gun commando build.
---
Already fixed
---
Try moving the camp zone to include the flamingo then try deleting it.
---
As much as I agree, it’s probably for balance’s sake. You’d be able to amass powerful weapons far too easily if you could (by Bethesda’s opinion - I don’t think it would be too bad, honestly).
---
It does allow you to have access to more items from enemies than just what they’d use, though, so I guess theirs a silver lining.
---
Yeah, my main is level 280+ and I started a new character, noticed it was extremely hard once I went past around level 20-ish, I was being drained of bullets far too often and had my main craft some to transfer to the newer character.
---
I realised the best option for newer players to kill their targets with ease is to get their hands on something with high DPS as soon as possible, such as a gatling plasma/laser or minigun.
---
I keep seeing this suggested, and I feel like people seriously underestimate what sort of miracles Bethesda would probably need to do to get this done.
---
I'm hoping everybody who suggests this knows that dual-wielding pistols would pretty much require Bethesda to effectively make a completely new weapon, with a completely unique set of first, and third-person animations.  It probably wouldn't be as easy as just having 2 10mm handguns in your inventory and being able to wield them together.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's certainly an interesting suggestion, but in the realm of new content I can see this game getting, I can't say I can imagine Bethesda making what is effectively an entirely new class of weapons of weapons and animations like this, it's far easier for them to continue on their path where they just reuse existing animations.
---
Doesn't that circle with a line through it mean you don't own it, therefore you cannot build it?
---
That’s pretty much how i play, bloodied heavy gunner and commando, just use covers and move quicker to play like a real FPS shooter game and not rely on the make-believe ‘sneak’. 
---
Sneak is a huge bonus to make the game easy but come on, with a sliver sense of realism you can’t just tell an enemy ‘hey I’m not here because I’m squatting and my Agility setting is through the roof’. And the ghoul be like ‘ok boss you’re not there although I can touch you’. It’s just too magical and not fun.
---
I'm just gonna follow what's on Bethesda's site for fixing crashes
---
I considered that... but i just couldn't justify it.  Went with the rad one, strength, agility, and the take one for team one.
---
I'm already used to swapping my perks and got my new ones lined up for when the debuff removal actually happens, so can't imagine it would be useful enough to waste a slot on it.
---
The team leader can kick people
---
The fancy one is bugged I think, if you're using that one.
---
Dual wielding some explosive pistols honestly gave me BOII zombies vibes lol.
---
Sooooo whaaaaaaat. Leader of the group gets to do what they want. Don’t like it? Start another group. Then you can be the big boss.
---
Cool, I hope it works out 👍
---
Time to destroy players camps!
---
Some way to find corpses would be great. At the end of an ops mission yesterday the body disappeared and there were four of us trying to find it unsuccessfully.
---
I've noticed this too. Particularly a lot less Collossal Problems. Though the nuke bug is still in the game so there's a been a few times I've been able to do back to back to back events.
---
It's given me a lot of time to build my new camp though.
---
It's the same sort of console you use to exit the vault in FO4 😉
---
Just not enough unique rewards for ACP once you have done it a few times - unless you want to farm screws of course. SBQ is a better target for those nukes if you want flux, legendaries (the Cursed weapons are pathetic, although I kept hold of the reduced weigh Shovel), misc rewards from mobs, and those rare plans she drops. Also a byproduct of the patch is that ACP has been made harder by the patch, SBQ made easier now it can be crippled again. 
---
Tbh my few nukes are usually aimed at Whitespring for the mass &amp; fluid crafting materials. I've been known to do multiple loops hunting respawns. 
---
Also I still can't figure out why Beth insisted on a nuke for ACP. They have Blast mines in the game already that have zero use.
---
I run a mod that makes ore light up, I tell myself it's an excavator helmet mod.
---
Honestly. “Every one gets the same drop” would be completely worth it
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f335fe&amp;d=a72am2ar2an2ao0a00a30eh2pg2p02ph2pp2pi2sg2ii0ir2ig0l12lt2lu2l71la2ce0x00x70xm0xb0xa1cu0c60ib0&amp;m=51c249f8ba&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w6w6w6&amp;wm=1k2834-1g283c-1b28&amp;ad=01348
---
This is my build. It is for commando with low health. The only changes for full health would be drop nerd rage and probably serendipity for something else. You can swap rifleman perks in for commando. I was originally a rifleman build way back and switched to commando because the dps is way better.
---
All of my armor is unyielding, which would also be useless at full health so that could be something else. When I tested rifleman last night, I only changed the commando perks for rifleman and healed fully. I also swapped receivers on my quad Fixer to hardened.
---
I'm considering a couple of tweaks, like dropping bloodied mess for critical savvy but I'm not sure.
---
ETA: Your build looks very similar to mine, but you are missing the defensive perks. Serendipity is crucial for low health. Evasive is great for general resistance as well. I got the chemist backpack mod so I could drop Traveling Pharmacy.
---
They could call the perk "Pistolero"
---
Even moreso this season because every little mole rat and scorched that wanders into your camp gives 100xp. I'm flying up the ranks just from the repeatable weekly.
---
im more lazy than that and i dare ask for IT : AUTOLOOT
---
If your on ps4 psn = hotrun 39 I would be more than happy to run some later this evening
---
Don't bulk junk.
---
There are 2 exceptions:
---
\- you want to sell it. For most junk items bulking is the only option to sell
---
\- Lead an aluminium these two are the only junk items where you get a weight advantage.
---
Magic eight ball says......”Outlook not so good.”
---
oh, you mean by that. you must have on a backpack or armor with weight reduction effects. those have always gotten disabled when in Power armor.
---
Nooooo I mean to enter the vault. I know that console lol. The vault door is closed and I cant get in
---
Run straight forward into the dining room and scoop up the plastics.   That way a lot fewer enemies get in the way.
---
Saved me about 5 perk points...not to mention the weight of food/water. Can you explain this debuff removal thing?
---
Dude, even before the new update. I was close to the school one day heading into town, the entire road was nothing but lvl 50 glowing ones. I was only around lvl 35 and freaked out. I wasn't expecting that in Fraternity Row.
---
Furious is terrible with the changes
---
Ok is it just me or was Berry Mentats working at first, where I could see the camo’d blood eagles, but then after a couple of minutes with the effect still active in my pip boy the mentats pink glowy things weren’t showing up? And then I ate more and still the effect wasn’t showing.
---
That’s  why I don’t have it as much on my alts. I though maybe it had to do with all the w/r perks and armors.
---
Lol true.   I can play at work and at home, and there is new content now so....   2806 hours into it now....   ugh
---
You were probably trash and didnt help out.
---
Especially since Beth isn’t going to do anything about it anyway
---
Pistols got a big buff with this patch.  Use concentrated fire and crit spam, they're stronger than all heavy weapons right now.
---
I min max in other games I’m more serious about, did not here, given my casual coop focus. I don’t even have a build. Is it needed for level 50? 
---
Don’t mod my weapons since mats are low and level past them quickly.
---
I like close/mid range shooting..
---
I half expect the reason to be "we could not figure out how to make this work without console commands being able to be used in it"
---
Someone posted on here that they spent the atoms to buy all 100 levels the first day the season came out. Not necessarily a bug or exploit.
---
Well if so then that sucks I saw the unlock for it
---
TSE &gt; Bloodied &gt; AA = Junkies
---
bird bones is good
---
Unarmed is already crap right now,so no ,rejected.
---
Do yourself a favor and check out the video Angry Turtle did yesterday, at the start he creates a .38 auto pipe rifle and has no issue with the ghouls in Charleston Capitol ,  he then runs a solo daily op using every weapon he is carrying ..
---
At the end you’ll see the build he uses and it’s by no means meta.. this is a build and load out that almost everyone can get with a bit of time and patience
---
Was probably nuked recently, Morgantown is a great place to nuke if your looking for hardened mass and high radiation fluids from ghouls
---
You can buy them. I bought them pretty early in my game, so it was either the vendor at Flatwoods, Charleston or Morgantown. One of those 3.
---
So, it's a roleplaying game, but only certain roles are "valid"...? Which just confirms what I said: we should have presets built into the game. That doesn't mean an automatic elimination of any and all free customisation, the two could exist together. But at least having the "valid" roles available to everyone would ensure a common basis for complaints.
---
Sidenote: yes, it's a roleplaying game. It has different interpretations. You can bring in the "holy trinity" tank/healer/dd, with everyone having one such role assigned, and forming appropriate parties to tackle content. It can also mean the kind of creative roleplaying where everyone creates their own unique character, with an emphasis on storytelling - obviously harder for a videogame to pull off well, but the thing exists, and when a game does offer full free customisation, then it should make sure not to cripple anyone to the point of unplayability.
---
Bottom line, though, I think, is that we need perk loadouts the day before yesterday, and indeed while at it, they should definitely offer at least some basic "classes", so that the average joe that doesn't spend ungodly hours scouring the depths of the internet for the perfect min/max build (and then ungodly hours farming the perfect gear for it) has some idea of where to go with their character. Especially considering the absolute pain in the rear that is respeccing in this game.
---
No I got it from the seson pass boardgame thing
---
5 minute buff still doesn’t feel that great. 10 or 15 seems like a much better duration due to how you have to kill a colossus every time you need to make one.
---
Those fights can last a lot longer then 5 minutes.
---
It's okay it took me a while to find it too
---
I'm saving up for my jetpack so I'll be doing that type of thing soon too.
---
Thanks I’ll try this... what if I don’t have the right perks yet? Its RNG right?
---
I like the idea. Good job.
---
Thanks for telling people how to target players for pvp.
---
I have noticed more SBQ likely because the wendigo spawns in CP are super annoying to deal with if the group isnt on crowd control properly.
---
Dang it's a lot better than I thought. The question is, how long does the effect last?
---
Early game is really a non-issue. The toughest opponent I had were level 17 wolves when I was the same level whilst doing Leader of the Pack (so you're facing 4 at a time). Didn't die once but was using a 1/2 a clip of 10mm auto pistol per wolf. One wolf alone would have been ok but 4 at once was the challenge.
---
Then again, a single baseball and frag grenade (two separate occasions) took out a whole pack of 4 at once.
---
The biggest issue is more just adjusting to the new normal. Few extra bullets, a bit more reliance on melee if you're actually smart and conserve ammo, not being stupid and taking on enemies only 1-2 at a time rather than packs of 4 of more and a few minor tweaks to how you choose perk cards e.g. anything above concentrated fire 1 is a waste for commando wannabe builds and anti armour perks are even more of a must than they use to be.
---
It's mostly just growing pains but I do feel Bethesda still need to address this issue as not all the filthy casuals would be into learning more about the game or spending that tiny bit of extra effort to be better prepared.
---
I've noticed the team list doesn't always update when someone joins Daily Op. Now when I join a daily op team I'll just jump in even when the team list doesn't show anybody in there and sure enough, there are team members in there.
---
Er yeah, the button to open the door is on the console. I just pointed out the FO4 thing so you can't miss it. The good news is once you get further along the quest line you can start using the service entrance.
---
Why?
---
5 minutes. It’s not that great but it’s at least something I guess.
---
All you had to do was tell people to turn on pacifist. Done and done. People don’t get pvp’d while at the same time not spreading how easy this bug is in terms of starting pvp.
---
Yet to have any crashes on ps4.
---
As much as I love the nerfs that make me try harder as a glass canon and see new ranks of high level enemies, it saddens me to think that this is hindering the experience of new players.
---
Same as some other alcohols are 4 minutes. Good for passing that luck check giving you trouble.
---
My main problem with Gauss pistol stealth sniping is how close I have to get  to an enemy, as the pistol seems to really sway about, being pretty unstable when I aim. 
---
But then again, I only have reflex sights installed, maybe I need some other mod or something.
---
Maybe initially, but they're coming back around.  People have figured out they are absolute XP pinata's.  Especially so if people think to pop a lunchbox with all the people around.  Usually I'll get max Very Well Rested after throwing out the first one from people following suit.
---
I usually have tenderizer on and then share inspirational. They do in fact stack right? Like if someone else share lvl 1-3 of inspirational or tenderizer it would stack with my perks? I don’t think strange in numbers stacks but what about straight bonus calculations.
---
Not worth the ammo cost since damage nerf probably. Also silos are harder to run now also with all the enemies scaling to your level
---
You're talking about the yellow ramp, correct
---
Not sure if they stack. Never really seen the idea of it mentioned so I'm not sure
---
It was the first perk I ranked up all the way.
---
I play a scribe for a small brotherhood of steel rp group, and since they have me as the tech guy, I always had to put points in hacker and lock pick. Feels so good to have more free slots.
---
Trick is nuke earl then the queen. After the queen, earl is back for another run. Sometimes you can get 2 earls by joining a team in another instance after finishing him quick.
---
Blame the Legendary Run. Many people trying to get ahead start by playing more and visiting more places. The result is your quiet corner with reliable resources is now being stripped bare regularly.
---
Great!
---
Hmm. I’ll have to look around see if it’s been mentioned before.
---
Finally can play. Now I have like 30 minutes to play for. Sigh
---
Nice find, I'll check out the new station and also curious if they're gonna add anything where he used to be.
---
PS 4
---
I know, but Iron Fist would be +20%/+40%/+60% instead of how it currently works, that's why I suggested tweaking mutations/STR multiplier.
---
Guess I'll start collecting those colossal wendigo balls from now
---
If you are looking for a team to complete the ops with, then start one of your  own and wait for enough people to join so you can finish it. Or join a new one that opens up after you join the server.  Don't join a full,   existing team. Nine times out of ten it's a team that is done with the op and no one has bothered to change the team goal.
---
Dont you have a Tinkers Bench in your CAMP? Use it. You can even travel for free there... ;)
---
That would be something and not sure if it would be fun. Lol
---
Good Luck, Godspeed!
---
That was my first thought, go PvP someone standing at their camp then decimate it.
---
Even then, at least it’s finally a good way to boost our luck on par with our ability to buff strength and endurance (+ 6 each from nuka dark), perception (+6 with just party person from Sweetwater and it even stacks with other alcohols as it is a “tea.” Also affected by herbivore and strange in numbers to go up to 15.), and better than other alcoholic methods of buffing charisma (+ 3 from standard beers) and agility (+ 3 from rum).
---
Now, if only we had scotch to buff our intelligence and reduce our perception, we could have alcoholics be disgustingly powerful.
---
You have 2806 hours into it? You’re telling me that the game has been out for less than 2 years and you have 100 days worth of gameplay time on it. Literally 4 hours every day since launch. Just stop playing it man.  Find a different game. You’ve literally beaten it.
---
I’m not even finished with my hormonal bullshit and I have to try and coach a 12 year old girl through hers. I have absolutely no hope for her future.
---
I think all of those are the Responders vendors, I guess OP could also check at Whitesprings Responders, too then.
---
Well, I would give money too, either without private server
---
Dual Gammas. The Blood Bane. Hi-Radical. Praise Atom!
---
yes, but only in power armor. i gotta say it is a much better investment then originally planned IMO. 
---
would be nice if the card specified that it recharged health and fusion cores
---
I thought more spongey enemies make it more viable, but it does take like 9 shots I think to reach +45% damage with furious. 9 shots is a lot considering I kill most things in 2-3 shots with my pistol. Probably will go with the sledge.

Under the old multiplicative damage model I could watch my damage triple from first to last hit with a Furious weapon. Won't happen now as the effect is now acting directly on the base damage rather than factoring every variable along the way. I test a rifle and it managed a mere +30% or so over multiple hits.
---
As a personal theory, I’d say it’s best use would be to take one from every Colossal problem, craft it into the drink and use it for the new fight. Used in this way, it becomes an infinite loop where one use = one sac.
---
Thanks!!!!
---
I've been winging headshots at range in VATS. Try to roll a 33 VATS.
---
Reflex is good, but get crack shot perks in perception for the range.
---
You managed to get into a 1 in 350000 situation and talk like it's happening every time. I also want to see this one shot they can do in power armor.
---
Also jump and vats and you should be able to easily target the bot,they can't nove exactly like it.
---
Nice!  I’ve been grinding those events for eternity trying to get that roll...  congrats!
---
The circle with the line through it over the atom symbol indicates that you don't own it or know the plan for it. I only asked my question because it is not available in the current season and you can buy the plan from the bullion vendors but it would still show as unowned if you hadn't read the plan. If I remember correctly, unlocking it in the Legendary Run last season automatically made it available.
---
 Well when i launched 3 nukes my game froze
---
Yeah it's strange. I guess the one in the crater is closer without counting loading.
---
Yes, I know but I play just a little every day, so I spend that time in events on public. Scrapbox is indispensable anyway.
---
Maybe i'm just a pleb who doesn't know the value of stuff or even care really, I got the War Glaive plan today and any extras I get will go straight in my vendor at cost value + 10% for bethesdas cut.  I'l do the same for the armor plans as well.
---
You're gimping yourself with furious. It's trash tier just a hair above mutant's.
---
Furious is only "good" against high health enemies but even then it's inconsistent. Accidentally hit a different enemy and your damage bonus is reset.
---
The same on xbox
---
High value plans and the like.

I even have at least 350 flux of every kind but i liked the farming
---
My dude and I finished two runs, both at 8:07 (somehow). Then we managed to get the boss to spawn at 6:57, and cleared it at about 7:35. 
---
I got the Super Generator and he got diddly squat lol
---
It was just a bug .. I was 30 over and jumped in my PW to fast travel and my inventory weight went up.  I didn't even know it was a bug. Been around since the start too. 🙂
---
Three times my team and I have missed it by mere seconds because someone had to reload or we got frozen and couldn't land that final blow and I LOVE AND HATE that tension!
---
We jumped right back in each time and got it the next round.
---
I'm assuming you are on PC and it would help to know your computer specs, internet speed etc. but I'm playing the game on an almost 8 year old gaming laptop and have none of these issues so from what I understand the issue is most probably on your end
---
Just turn on pacifist mode, learned that the hard way.  Any high level that takes raider rp too seriously will take every chance they get to force you into pvp and take all your junk and caps. The usual trick for those who forget is to just walk in front of your line of fire before proceeding to one shot you.
---
Stay vigilant, check your settings often.

Honestly, as a Berserker, I disagree. The whole point of being a Berserker is being a badass \*without\* armor.
---
What's needed are some Berserker-specific perks to help avoid damage. Think something like martial artists (not the perk) or Viking berserkers. They were either massively in tune with their bodies or raged/drugged out of their minds, so that affected how they perceived or handled incoming damage. The lower the DR, the more ability for them to ignore or avoid damage. Basically, something like Serendipity but for Berserker. Like a 4 star perk that gives a percentage to avoid all incoming damage with a 10% chance to proc at 1 star and a 40% chance to proc at 4 stars (when wearing no armor).
---
And a damage buff to something like 150% to 200% damage output at 0 DR would help make up for being insanely fragile. Also, remove the negative damage punishment when you have something other than 0 DR.
---
What a lot of people don't know is that Berserkers, if they get above something like 140 total DR (which I think is actually fine for a DR cap for the build), their weapons do -50% of base damage. Yes. You read that right. This is unnecessarily punitive. Just make it drop to 0 dmg buff.
---
Another couple ideas for perks:
---
1. a bonus to carry weight or straight STR buff the lower your DR. Maybe something like +5 STR at 0 DR.
---
2. a perk that boosts calculated AGL the lower your DR. Like +5 AGL at 0 DR. This could be explained that, without all that weighty armor on, the toon is MUCH more agile.
---
I think that market exists because some people wanted to spend more time doing business than playing. 
---
I have bought and sold two-shot explosive, Bloodied, instigating, rare outfits, weird plans and whatever you can imagine. I have gotten more godrolls I could use, sold them, gave them away. 
---
If you play the game, it happens. If you want to be shark, digital negotiator and trader, well, good for you. 
---
I see people offering a kidney for things I have bought for 2K or sold for 1K. And if you visit enough vending machines, you'll find your dream weapon or piece of armor for 500.
---
I wonder what prompted the move.
---
Do you want to be the DPS or tank? Former for the former, latter for the latter.
---
I just started a new one (only level 3 or 4) and so far no issues at all. However, I know what I'm doing now. I know how to prioritize a build. I know that melee is great for low level play. I know about running out of ammo and stimpaks. So it's really not a fair test.
---
You should also be able to have two brass knuckles, boxing gloves, or power fists. If I was mainly using those items I would logically want one on each hand.
---
It only makes you invincible against energy weapons though.  I am starting to wonder if these legendary perks were a sneaky way of making legacy weapons useless in PVP. That's actually a good thing because dupers have been abusing the hell out of them. With sizzling style and electric absorption, it does seem that you would be immune to damage from explosive lasers.   If so then that's an idea I am fully on board with.
---
Nope that also happened at same time to friend who plays with me. GTX 1080 SLI and 1700x on my and 1050Ti on my friend's side.
---
Bloodied PA melts as always
---
I don’t blame the higher lvl like he is a cheater, griefing is a big part of mmo’s which can really suck at time, and be fun at times.

You on Xbox? I got the mats to help you get your base rebuilt, no harm no foul.

They should it made so, that everyone has a choice. Ditch levelscaling and give the ability to gain an mutation that scales the player down to enemies. That could be available from start via an item and adding a special slot for it. Equip for level scaling and better rewards or just ignore it. 
---
The game would be basically like it's now, if you equip it. 
---
But they need with every kind of scaling way better rewards in quality or a legendary crafting system to make exactly the stuff want, idc how much it would cost me. Hell, they could the components even tie to hardcore challenges, but they need to compensate the scaling and loss of power.
---
I'm most mad about to have no choices anymore. Taking us the ability to make our chois how to play is a big no no for an open world game.
---
I've seen a video from a guy with an OP flame thrower, just ranging as a bloodied through west tek with his power armor. He was maybe at 15% and doesn't even gat a scratch, two shots every super mutant with his 416 dmg weapon AFTER Update 22. I don't know what perks and power armor he has, he doesn't show it, but he showed his wepaons. 
---
But not everyone has the luck get such a nice thing. I look everyday a player vendors for good stuff, change the server and again, but no luck.
---
I guess hackers and hacked cheat wepons will ne now more a thing than ever. :-/ I don't want to know how many player now struggle and being angry about the heavy nerfs, since so many weapons are just useless now. I tried my anti armor stuff, but stick to bloodied, it's for me the only way to chill and kill, but i miss sneaking and sniping so hard. Playing as an StarCraft II Ghost was so cool. But unless i get an op sniper rifle, i have to be an Thor instead. :-/ Before you ask why i'm mad about this: i hate power armor, i don't like to spray and melt, it feels so generic.
---
New players won't be happy at the moment, since the scaling is buggy and the mob LP is jumping up and down or hits doesn't being count. The game is so strange since this patch, i've never seen so many bugs in the last year.
---
Do you know what hack and slash is ?
---
You aren't.
---
Only game I play, and not much else interests me.   
---
Outer Worlds was great, but short
---
Yeah its additive now and calculates off base damage. Before it was multiplicative and took all damage boosts into account.
---
It is already happening and already being done. There are multiple easy to find tutorials on it. Just wanted to let players know why and how it was happening. I'm not going to just say hey turn on pacifist cause I said so. I'm going to tell them why they should turn on pacifist, whats triggering the bug, and 2 ways to prevent it. Pacifist or remove take one for the team. But if you'd prefer to have an ill informed wasteland then by all means ignore it entirely 😁
---
Pretty sure you are just unlucky, I have had both good runs and bad runs since the patch came out
---
I was gonna make a post similar to this, I don't mind that they have nerfed the way damage stacks, it was a little out if control before, but the perk cards really need attention now. They're just not worth having anymore.
---
I'd say go full unyielding or do 3 uny pieces and 2 bolstering. If you can get the right armor, the bolstering doesn't make much of a different and full unyielding is super powerful
---
At least they've acknowledged that it needs some tweaking for low levels 
---

If you wanna tank, hop on a power armor or don't do low health build in the first place.
---
Are the Mothman goggles a mask item separate from the hat?
---
I don’t want to buy the pack if the goggles and hat together are classified as one item.
---
How do you turn on pacifist
---
Would a level 15 be able to hang?
---
It's insulting that they have someone with dual pistols as part of the "Power Patrol" gameboard.
---
Hey nerds, look what you can't do!
---
Bug is already widely known in the PvP world. It has not be discussed at all or explained to the casual players. Just simply spreading awareness, and explaining exactly why and how it is happening.
---
It's actually easier now
---
If that happens I do it once more but slowly and it always fixes it
---
It's not being better prepared. High levels don't even use much ammo on enemies with their level while said *casual* low level need to spend one or two full clips on single trash that is one level above or equall. Add to that levels 11 to 20 is basically a limbo as you don't have possibility to craft gear for level 15 but you start to drop stuff fro lvl 10 or 20. Bethesda need to adjust health/to possibiliy of dealing damage cuz for now enemies at lower levels hit hard and gets small damage if you happen to enter open combat.
---
My alt was a bloodied stealth sniper, all I did to change my build is replace all the rifleman perks to commando and replace my gunslinger perks ( used a pipe revolver) to adrenaline and I was good to go 
---
Atm I'm using a normal auto fixer and vatting things to oblivion with ease along with using a 1* bloodied auto handmade
---
Man, could you imagine? A bloodied pistol in one hand, vampires in the other, or any other number of interesting combos.
---
It honestly is that nuts, yeah. I really am all for the monster design people to just go nuts.
---
I would want to dual wield two quad 10mms just for the memes. The DPS on that would probably be pretty damn good though
---
DUAL.
---
If I join a DO group and they're not currently in a DO or start a DO within a few minutes, I bounce...
---
Long story short, I escaped the min at the end of ACP like a split second after the timer hit 0. It was a close one.
---
Harder, for sure.Too hard, nope.
---
Mid-game levels...
---
I leveled a stealth vats sniper from \~28-45 over the last week and have had zero issues. I can still one-shot headshot most things. Robots are hard to one-shot with ballistic ammo, but they don't really give me pause. I use the stealth suit exclusively and use hit and run tactics, I'm only in danger if I get swarmed "In Danger" and can't use stealth hits. I use Escape Artist so running then crouching typically resets that scenario (when it works, seems a bit bugged lately).
---
Beginning levels...  
---
Started a PA Heavy Gunner and they are \~32 now, and again, no serious issues. I haven't found a heavy gun yet so I've been using a shotgun and baseball bat pretty much. Got the excavator PA \~28 and it's gotten way easier these last few levels from that. Once I get close to 35-40 range, hopefully the muties will drop a mini-gun.
---
I will say no matter the level, killing equal level stuff gets you a ton of XP and you actually level faster now than pre-22, especially with the group tool and free travel to the events. That's a good way to get a huge burst of XP every 30 minutes or so.
---
I mean you can say nope all you want, but when both a PC, Xbox and PS4 player comments that hey have yet to have a problem (I know I'm not talking for all PC players and there might be someone out there with a similar problem) it kinda speaks for itself that it might be on your end, maybe try reinstalling the game, verify game cache if you have it on steam, see if that fixes it?
---
agreed. one hand melle weapon needs love too
---
I'm sure it will look perfect in the instantiated camp
---
And streamline similarly for hacker, lock-pick, and everything else that has multiple cards that do the same thing.
---
I am and i found out it is :/
---
I need my repair kits !!!
---
Yep. The random drops have been a 'feature' since day one. 
---
Glad I'm not more easily irritated.
---
In game. 
---
Go to the world map.  
---
Go to the left side of the page where it brings up Atom shop and challenges.  
---
Scroll down to Settings and select.  
---
Then Select Game.  
---
Then down a little bit there is a section labeled pacifist.  
---
Make sure that tab is on.
---
I have a tse minigun reduced weight, which I have kept because it is visually fantastic to fight bosses with it. Pure show, even when damage is not great.
---
My mules still have a couple of furious, explosive and bloodied versions. I even gave one away, two stars, tse, because this guy was really in love with it. 
---
And you are right about the 50 cal feeling a bit meh. The LMG, on the other hand, feels like a beast.
---
If you want to run the op, then start your own team or join a brand new  one that starts AFTER you have  joined the server.  If you join an  existing team, nine times out of ten it's a group that is done with the op and hasn't bothered to change the team's goal.
---
Oh shit, are we only doing one post per complaint now?
---
Unyielding if you’re stealth commando or melee
---
Bolstering if you’re pure heavy guns
---
I had a L13 stalled because of the Ounce of Prevention bug. That's fixed now so I jumped on for a session and got up to L18 with no problems. The enemies were definitely higher level than old but not unkillable by any definition. I think people may have gotten too comfortable with being able to stroll around the full map at low level when it simply wasn't designed to be that way. Now they will have to actually do more quests in the North and West to level up before heading to Watoga and SBQ, what a disaster!
---
I went in as a level 2. So I don’t see why not. Just not with me - I don’t know my way around these places.
---
This. My main is 349 and I started a new character yesterday. What Rads really smooths out the early game.
---
Um I have no idea I usually just hoover up everything that drops and scrap it all.
---
If you're looking for it then you're probably out of luck sorry.
---
I had a level 13 with me today, he did fine
---
I probably won't notice, gonna grind nuclear winter the whole time so I never have to look at that game mode again.
---
Or they could stay revved up for a few seconds after you stop shooting so that you may instantly start firing again after moving position or targets.
---
I play this game for fun i give rare shit away constanly give ammo away constantly, give 1000s of steal away regularly. But when i want somthing 95 percent of time they want my best shit im using its crazy.
---
Reddit moment.
---
1 solution Daily Ops.  Forget the timer, and remember you can do it unlimited for Ammo of the weapon type you use.  Take some friends, or a team and get even more ammo.  When this update came out I had 12.5k Fusion cells.  Doing Daily Ops just once per day I'm up to 17k...  Once you finish the Op, don't look at the reward screen and go loot all the bodies that didn't de spawn.
---
And you always get legendary gear, sometimes extra, up to 500 caps and loot..... Daily Ops are fantastic.
---
100% agree. Bethesda already has epic version of the enemies in the game like the bohemoth, Mirelurk queen, grafton monster and more they could tweak and make a special version that is world boss level. Could you imagine a epic mothman fight? Make him not as tough but do crazy damage. Combo with the teleport and you have a crazy fight. It seems to work just fine as they did it will all the bosses we have now so just keep doing that with assets we have.
---
There’s plenty of people who just want the scrap box and tent but still buy fallout 1st because to them it’s worth it. If bethesda made a cheaper subscription they would end up losing more money then they make
---
I’m a slut for dual wielding weapons, give us dual knives too please!
---
They’re referring to the rain in the greenhouse.
---
The game suggests one. Use whichever you like. It's like collecting the bug pieces, or the DNA sample from a scorchbeast. The game is gentle enough to tell you there is one there for sure.
---
Can I ask a related question: does a player really need lockpick (or hacker) at all?
---
I usually take all three lockpick cards, but they seem only useful a handful of times, and the gear that’s even in three star safes is meh compared to stuff you get other ways.
---
Fallout 76 loot drop is like a box of chocolates... You never know what you get
---
Eat! There are children starving in the Commonwealth. You should be thankful for what you have.

I agree 100% they give u a chance to get it f2p. Then sell items right after. Ill just pass on the insanity grind.
---
I was running around with a brand new alt and discovered it’s really not “one” wasteland. There were a few spots I encountered level 20+ enemies with my level 4 character. I think that’s good, dangerous areas should remain very dangerous. Otherwise the enemies were my level and enough of a challenge to remind me that I’ve got a fresh newbie vault dweller with crappy found gear and four perks. So the early levels are as they should be, no complaints here.
---
Well, I haven't even gotten one yet, but I understand the frustration of getting more than 1 of any plan you can't drop or trade.
---
It should remove the plan from your loot pool, once you learn it.
---
Not very Social of Ward to keep demanding I bring back water filters they have tons of that a raider stole one of so their people wouldn't contract dysentery
---
Cannot access your Google doc.  Says it needs to request access from you.
---
I loved playing my stealthy berserker commando. Always so much fun. Now it's become kind of a miserable slog in every firefight and I'm respeccing because I just can't see how I could make my build viable again.
---
Carnivore mutation can be a pain sometimes 😅
---
Good point.
---
But while we're complaining, why do the Whistle in the Dark plans even exist? 
---
Like sure, I might want one for my weapons collection.
---
But why would I want the ability to craft a nocturnal assault rifle? Who chose this one terrible survival mode reward to be a daily op "rare reward" and why?
---
...and why did I have to have it drop as my "rare reward" twice in a row? Fml
---
I'm only doing it for the beer stein and game board. 
---
And guess where those are? :^)
---
Not saying they should change, hell no, the steins and boards are the perfect "I did this :)" camp display rewards and I happily put them in my camp museum
---
On PC, I fought a bit trying to get my headset to work but just gave up, audio cuts out completely.  Lots of people don't use mic for a bunch of reasons. If you ask yes/no questions or something else people can respond to with an emote you might have more luck. "Thumbs up if you're ready to go"
---
"max run speed bonus" wait are you saying me using speed demon and speed perks is useless
---
Exactly! I would love to trade the 3 that I have gotten. Otherwise, it's just taking up space for other items I don't have.
---
I had this as well, right after patch 22.
---
I run a berzerker commando, I mean it did better than i expected, but my weapon was showing a very small increase in damage when I would unequip it and then equip it again.  Either way my biggest complaint is just let me equip broken armor. I still enjoy it.  Give me additional bonus for going negative DR instead of breaking berzerkers when you are below zero.  If I need to do the daily op where I can't sneak I just get in PA and use a furious rifle or something.
---
Yes. Only level five at the moment. Having no trouble killing things.
---
Infiltrator and what rads are VERY helpful. I'm sure ammo factory will be, too. So us veterans are already a step ahead of noobies as soon as we walk out of the vault.
---
I'm so sorry. Thank you so much. Now I see what you were talking about 😩
---
Not only that, with how consistant XP can get you can actually measure how many enemies it would take to get some score. It's great.
---
Ooof, was the primary nocturnal though? Haha
---
This place has been an echo chamber for a long time, if not from the start
---
Like when you're being shot with a laser from a laser rifle by a Super Mutant and they drop a fucking dildo.
---
Can confirm they exist, I got it yesterday.
---
All new content in this game is ultimately ruined by the bullshit RNG. Eventually you get it all or just give up after about 2 weeks.
---
Once of my Chrs has a Bloodied FFR 10mm SMG and it used to rip holes in large bodies while laughing loudly. Not tried it since the patch but I suspect it will be much less effective damage wise (pretty much like everything else) but still have the problem of it emptying the mag so often you spend more time reloading than firing.
---
Right, there was an issue. It should work now.
---
I believe berserker is viable, but not at Daily Ops. Which is silly, because that kind of operation would require stealth and discretion in real life. 
---
All stealth based builds are not Ops friendly. And Vampire tanks now should rule the world.
---
It's interesting build for sure. If you think about it though, could be a full health broken chameleon sentinel set and put out more damage than the bloodied floppers. It would be the meta.
---
I've actually noticed that I'm finding *more* bobbleheads than previously. Which is working well for me as I'm working on the World Challenge to use 76 bobbleheads. Could be a coincidence and maybe I've just gotten lucky, but it's a noticeable difference so far
---
...did you even read what I wrote?
---
I'm not debating its existence. 
---
I'm debating *the reason* for its existence.
---
I sell mothman egg omelets for daily caps with vendors.. along with chems and whatever excess junk I have on hand since the previous day
---
helps keep the stash weight in check that way also..
---
lots of people farm purified water
---
It's a good source of ammo stims caps and xp. I'm low 300, bloodied unyielding, with inspirational and a few easy xp buffs I can level up in a couple runs with  a full team. Plus I think it's fun so it's a win win way for me to farm for legendary perks.
---
You said you got it from the season board thing. Did you go and claim it? Or is it still there in the scoreboard waiting to be claimed? That’s the only reason I can think of.
---
The effect of Hack and Slash is just AOE Damage, not really an explosion in the Demolition Expert Term so, No, Demolition Expert does not Affect the damage hack and slash gives off when you proc it
---
They are not required to complete any missions or get any special gear...but just feels like part of the lore/game. If I'm scrounging I better know how to pick a lock and if I wanna know what everyone's life was like pre-war, I better be able to hack their computer journal.
---
I've had a build without either and it was manageable, just not as engaging.
---
Zealots, handy for queen fights I guess. Working on completing my set and then I’ll start perfecting it. For now I’m pretty content with the weight reduction.
---
10mm smg was really fun..haven't tried it lately
---
Try equiping the trail frireworks for that sweet reload speed
---
Before I jump off for the day, I sell all my drugs, half my radaway, all my radx, and depending how many stims, 3/4 of them. Any weapons I get that I don't use I sell. Do the events and kill super mutants, they usually always have a few caps on them. Uranium fever is a good good event, it's not much but the claws and shotguns add up in caps at the end. Also find something people need or want and sell.
---
It would fall under the typical commando build.
---
Auto 10mm pistol guerrilla build may be what your looking for.
---
Yes  you can get all the normal legendary perks for that.
---
Yeah I went in as a 16 yesterday and didn’t go down at all. You should be good
---
with the new additive system this should be very easy to do.. although personally I think doubling base damage might be a bit extreme...
---
I took a guys workshop right in front of him other day. He just stood outside the border looking at me xD
---
I don’t have that legendary perk but this has still happened to me at the end of events lately. A guy wiped me and my squad on our low level characters after SBQ just to take our junk. Totally sucked.
---
Depends on what you mean by viable. Bosses tend to have very high explosive resist, as do scorchbeasts, but for pretty much anything else they're actually pretty good after the buff. A two shot ffr auto grenade launcher is about the best you can get, and it will destroy even higher level enemies very quickly
---
High value plans are still RNG and just as bad as the odds at Mumbles.
---
You're not alone. I built my character from 1-50 as a stealth rifleman. It is not viable to be a rifleman at higher levels. 
---
I can't even use my favorite Lever Action because of how small dps is compared to commando. I agree that semi rifles across the board need a buff, a large one. 
---
Atleast they buffed the pistols a bit with tank killer. My pistol build buddy enjoyed that.
---
The station was empty and he didn't want to keep being out in the open like that is my guess. He left a note at his old spot telling you he had moved, but haven't read the note myself so i don't know if it states why
---
Oh I fully admit this was my own stupid, don't worry. No excuses here, just F
---
Positive effect only food/drink is planned for a future patch. Tbh I don't think the current model is bad and maybe just a less aggressive negative rate would be better especially if you have diseases.
---
I won't drink it. The fear effect is something that adds to the entertainment. And to be honest, Mirelurk queens and other enemies should trigger it too.
---
Ahh,I'm guilty of at least once or twice.i hadn't started the ops quest or whatever yet and thought the dailies were the original ones, no wonder I wasn't getting crap for completing stuff when it was supposed to be extra XP 🤷
---
I feel that they are still worth having, but up to 9 points is excessive
---
For me it seems like my heavy PA build has gotten better since the update. I haven’t really played since Season 1 dropped, but I began playing last night out of morbid curiosity to see what the fuss was about. I didn’t change anything about my perk cards or my weapons and Armor. I’m only a Lvl 130 right now. Is there any reason why I might’ve increased in damage and health?
---
My red was in the laundry room bottom floor, the blue room have was I  the shower room upstairs. I left the others I don't want as it helps with respawn if you don't pick them up
---
as far as i am aware, yes. unless they decide to change it
---
It comes from entering PA with a delay.
---
If your PA isn’t entered instantly, and it has that delay where you run around and then it spawn on you, you sometimes can’t get out.
---
Go dome a random mob with a .50cal sniper no sneak bonus then tell me it’s extreme;)
---
Heh no worries.
---
Trying to buy something is hell, but when you do a new event and an expensive new item just drops into your lap, it's amazing. Because of Meat Week, I was able to get a B2525 Handmade and Fixer.
---
Yes, but only if they are actually playing the DO lol.
---
Sitting at your camp for 40 minutes while I wait to play with you is a no no
---
Game was always hard and challenging early on. A ghoul swarm would kill you even if they were levels less than you and you might kill one if you were lucky. Combat should be avoided as much as possible when a lower level but everyone wants to take on 4-5 enemies face to face.
---
probably something coming up with the BOS content.
---
I’ve never successfully traded for anything because I don’t have anything like OP listed.
---
There’s one gun - one gun - I want and I’ll be playing the RNG game until the end of time because no one wants just straight caps.
---
I’m 1/4 at this point, I got two plans in my second day though. But I also go from camp to camp, hoping to find the new rare plans and have found a couple of people selling them. While do both the daily ops and sever hoping for camps, Ives been able to get 4 of the rewards. I’d suggest doing both to have some luck finding the plans if you have the time to search around camps.
---
Yeah once I saw a raider use a gatling gun, killed them and got a gatling laser  instead. 🤔
---
It's annoying when you want to scrap them for mods.
---
Play a different game
---
Im taking 3 SPECIALs first.. this will allow me to max the stats out and move some points into other stats when I get the cards maxed..
---
What Rads will be my #4 pick.. Ill probably also snag the lockpicking/hacking one..
---
I havent really thought about the 6th slot too much since that one is a way off for me at present
---
Here's a good strategy I use:
---
Invest in Green Thumb in perception. 
---
Slot it and run over to the farms north of Camden Park (sorry forgot the names, one is a workshop) 
---
Pick all the Razorgrain and Corn (should be around 140 each) and sell at a vendor
---
If you want even more money, invest in Super Duper and be prepared to make alot of boiled water.
---
Make all these crops into soup and sell.
---
You may think so but that's just not my experience. From what I've experienced personally and from what I've seen from other players, there's little inherent in the game I feel that prevents you from thriving at any level. The problem is mostly the player. Whether it's due to their knowledge or playstyle or whatever.
---
Having said that though, saying "git gud" isn't helpful either. It'd be nice if some of these people actually attempted to adapt but I've seen that some have tried and still struggle.
---
Like I already said, I think there is some tweaks that need to be made by Bethesda. This we at least agree on.
---
😳 man that blows what perks did you have equipped? Im trying to make a full bug report for bethesda  you can pm if youd rather that.
---
Makes sense - I’m an OG Wasteland / Fallout player - but I just can’t see burning a legendary perk slot for Infiltrator. 
---
With One Wasteland aren’t the damage perks kinda necessary now?
---
Fair enough!
---
I can understand maybe missing rewards with lower ranks for a day or two but when you hit Elder which is supposed to be 80% odds...FOUR DAYS in a row I definitely agree
---
Didn't know about the note! Thank-you for the head's up; I'll go check it out later.
---
thanks for the awesome replies everyone, it's just i'm slowly getting burnt out and want to try something new to spice up the game.
---
now to look for those said perks... x_x
---
It takes 1 perk coin to remove a card, and it keeps all its ranks. It will just take another coin to remove a different card to re-equip the one you had before. It's not a massive cost by any means, but if you keep switching out it will add up over time. For your build, I would recommend legendary agility, perception, or luck if they're not at 15 yet. Master infiltrator is a good QoL perk, but not by any means necessary. Ammo factory doesn't seem like it will be too necessary for you, since bows are pretty ammo efficient and pistols use easy to find/make ammo. Follow through might be good, since with the bow you will be getting a lot of sneak criticals
---
Did the game also reset all your emotes?
---
Cause I just noticed that as well. 
---
Looks like a complete reset was done
---
I also play with a group of growing friends on ps4 and we often look out for each other with ammo , equipment etc etc and no trading , if my boy a bloodie build and I get a bloodie 3 star I’ll offer it to him if he needs it or not
---
where do you think Bethesda gets its good ideas? you dont really think THEY came up with them on their own, do you?
---
I dont think so, the hunting rifle is trash compared to a semi-automatic handmade (same level, with all rifleman perks upgraded) Same with the gaus rifle, i do more damage with the handmade than those weapons.
---
The Furious Explosive Rapid dildo will fetch some serious caps.
---
Next update: remove weapon condition
---
unless you are PA user they are shit
---
They used to be. I used to MAIN a character with that weapon (two-shot, faster fire, reduced weight) and 1500 grenades with me at all times. Somewhere, somehow, a patch or update made them very fragile: the weapon would break after 15-20 shots. So, I put it away.
---
The newest update has probably hit them hard, since level scaling means you won't clean areas as you used to.
---
In it's prime, a single shot would kill and tag like a beast.
---
I can't remember what I was doing but I ended up getting killed by a mothman and a  snallygaster twice when I shot mini nukes at them that never exploded. Then I got killed a couple of times by a yao guai that kept repeatedly hitting me from about 10 ft away, I assumed it was my internet bogging but maybe it was a server issue too
---
Power armor with Blocker and Lone Wanderer is life. Those deathclaws do nought but tickle me.
---
Yeah, that’s a pretty good roll for the time being. 
---
I know a lot of people are saying the modifiers for specific enemies are actually worth having around now. Especially on weapons
---
I agree with that statement.
---
Party person?
---
Sneak Suit makes it a cakewalk to solo
---
I just wish there was a functioning economy. I get we need some limits, but 30k caps is like imposing a real life money cap of a month's wage for a middle class family. When everyone is constantly sitting on 30k caps, the economy shuts down. Now it is getting so bad, even black market trading (out of game arranged trades) is skyrocketing and the prices are insane. There needs to be MUCH high caps in this game or many more useful cap/scrip/legendary sinks.
---
Few ideas below, I'm sure many have been suggested before.
---
\- increase all limits (caps,scrip,bullion,etc)
---
\- allow people to extract legendary modules from legendary gear. 
---
\- Increase the level cap on legendary weapons. Say we make it 100. Perhaps all these can be crafted? only small chance to get highest level. Perhaps smash two similar lower ones to get a chance at higher. Perhaps, two 40's smashed together have a chance at a level 80? Anyways, we need many more legendary item sinks. Mama Mumbles was a decent idea, but isnt keeping up with the times, especially with current limits. Also IF THEY FIX duping in this game, and we have a new tier or two of weapons, all those dups are basically erased. They are purely collectors items. Legacies... gone (at the highest tiers, again now purely collectors items). The past is basically erased. They are rebalancing damage, weapons, etc, now is the time to design for things like this.
---
\- make a function in game trade system.
---
It's pretty good now. Obviously a bit gimped compared to your other commando choices, mainly due to its lack of a suppressor or sights, but it's still powerful. I tried the 1* old guard's SMG yesterday and was able to kill max level yao guais with one clip of headshots. A good 3* 10mm smg should do the job even faster
---
[This map will help!](https://i.imgur.com/BCJk8wd.jpg) This map will show you where the spawns are!
---
I had Exploding Palm, Hack and Slash, Infiltrator, and Legendary Strength. And my friend only had like ammo factory on I think. 
---
They didn’t show up as red and none of us were wanted or anything. Surprised the hell outta me. 😓
---
There isn't really such thing as a starting build. You're better off working out what build you want to end up and just work towards that.
---
Surprisingly, yes. I have a Mutant's FFR 10mm sub and it tears through enemies. 
---
It isn't my best weapon, but I use it on smaller enemies and the ammo is relatively cheap.
---
Not gonna lie I have enjoyed being able to grief a  couple trap bases that I stumbled into with this glitch.
---
I really just want a big boss for a mothman or all the cryptids if that was possible. We have the wendigo already and I think a mothman boss would be really cool cause we would likely get a plushie and camp display item and I think taxidermied mothman wings would be cool.
---
could have sworn that got fixed patch 22
---
I stopped doing ACP bc Earle kept glitching out and doing the cha cha slide. 
---
*slide to the ceiling, slide to the ground, take it back now y'all, 5 hops this time!* 
---
And it's impossible to kill him when that happens. While that may be great for farming screws, ammo &amp; XP for the players that join you, it's still a waste of a keycard and silo run to trigger it and not be able to complete it
---
BE90 gat plasma, B LMD 25 fixer 
---
Was the same before... Now damage is half and 33%  respectively. Still taking things out in very few shots thankfully.
---
I just gave in and started using a two shot explosive gatling gun for most stuff. I still use unyielding armor and run low HP because the stat boosts are nice even without a bloody weapon, though I do carry a bloody ultracite gatling laser for the queen and Earle. For stealth I have an instigating Fixer that kills plenty of stuff in one headshot still. I have all the perks to have both rifles and heavy weapons buffed at once, it feels good being able to just swap to whatever I feel like at the moment.
---
The point is I don’t want to pay someone for something I should be getting as a drop
---
Yes, I saw an image a while back. However, I came across a camp yesterday that had 4 of them and yes, they are creepy.
---
Any good team leader changes the focus back and forth between daily ops and casual and events and casual.  You get a leader who does that as ya'll do different things and you can really maximize results.
---
Of the ones I've tested at &gt;20hp bloodied still does the most but the gap really has come down and the downside to low hp is now more of a thing. I think AA and vampire's are probably the most useful effects at the moment. I mention effects rather than weapons because I run a lot of different characters so it's a tricky question to answer.
---
Its just simply not worth doing either. 
---
Also the fact that acp still isn't level locked after one wasteland just adds insult.
---
Thanks. I was wondering what the creepy factor was on these. I was hoping it would be more like a fortune teller type thing.
---
My not alone what?
---
For food carry candy from the monster mash event. It is extremely light and doesnt expire and very easy to get hundreds of. You can eat just enough to fast travel if that's all you want to use it for
---
That space could be covered up nicely by my prisoner collar, IF ONLY IT COULD BE WORN WITH THE MASK. RIP to my prisoner days. :&lt;
---
No problem:) I think it is a world spawn tho so it might not be there when you get there but im gonna check it out myself later:)
---
Have you angered Miss Fortuna somehow?
---
It’s been on console for a few weeks now
---
If Cujo, the radroach, has managed to survive to the ripe old age of lvl61, it's probably learned a few things about biting your ass.
---
The arm rotates in the motion of taking off / putting on the hat and there is a creepy sound effect.
---
It's less what's worth it and what's not worth it. Don't pick any of the exploding attack ones. They don't trigger often enough (even at max rank) and they send corpses flying. Good luck finding that legendary that you just killed. Hack and Slash is the only worthwhile one but since you're not a melee build anyhow, it's not a consideration.
---
My advice is to imagine what your character will be like at level 300 and work backwards from there in terms of what legendaries to pick and then select the most immediately useful for your build now.
---
ok thanks havent played in awhile
---
Most (hopefully all) duping glitches have been patched, but that doesn't remove the resources from circulation. This still causes inflation and raises trading prices astronomically.
---
go for STR at first, and find a good melee weapon, ammo is hard to come by at lower levels.
---
I didnt hate the game until the most recent patch
---
Its bad
---
You know it, I know it, bethesda knows it and so does zenimax.
---
Thanks for the info wanted to know befor i dump all my points into strenght
---
Did you remember to claim it form the Legendary Run Board?
---
i think if we could use them in same time still we couldn't cover neck by prison collar !
---
&gt;Thats some wasted potential  
---
Fallout 76 in a nutshell.
---
Nukes and dragons has a build planner, but it might be better to wait until you try out the game for a bit and know what you're doing. There are so many different things to try that it seems pretty hard to choose one without even knowing what they're like. The early game introduces you to pistols/rifles mostly, and then shotguns not long after. You start out with a decent range of melee weapons available. Then you get introduced to heavy weapons and automatic rifles a bit later on. Eventually you will get to a point where you can decide whether or not you want to use power armor with your build, which mutations to take, what legendary effects to focus on, etc. My advice would be to try a bit of everything
---
There’s a note on the table
---
This would be amazing, but I fear it would be beyond the current game engine's capabilities. Of course, I say this with precisely zero programming knowledge, so who knows?
---
All I can say is that when I first started, I REALLY wanted to do a pistol build. I still do. I would grind up to re-spec immediately if I knew that pistols were becoming actual weapons, rather than the bb guns we currently have.
---
So far it's been 1 pm EST but they said they intend to make it 12 pm EST at some point.
---
I have this issue only on my toon that has the uny SS armor.
---
I hope so. I’ve saved 3 pieces of troubleshooters cavalier that I hope will have a use outside of encrypted.
---
This is the exact genius 200 IQ answer I was afraid of, but thank you for giving me an answer that will justify why they haven’t done it after all this time :)
---
Yo y'all need to check out the gamma gun. I don't have a single pistol perk on and this thing bangs harder than my God tier commando guns. http://imgur.com/gallery/PXsozmA
---
End game how?
---
End game boss, you have better options but you'll at least secure your loot at SBQ. Harder for you to solo a boss on your own.
---
If you just mean regular mobs, it's ok. You're going to need a lot of ammo and repair it a lot.
---
I will never achieve any of these ranks because I stop to look for s*** to pick up constantly
---
Str also lets you get shotgun and heavy weapons perks so its a good early max. As well as endurance or luck for survivability
---
You realize most players and every dev plays in 3rd person right? That's why 3rd person isn't as buggy
---
Edit: keep downvoting and ignore that heavy guns have terrible clipping with most PA and the Ghillie season 1 armors
---
Like Forrest Gumps Mama always said:  "Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."
---
I went into the vault tec agricultural centre yesterday and there was a horde of level 75 bloated glowing ones waiting for me. Probably the quickest I've ever been torn to shreds in a Fallout game
---
Fresh character able to unlock any terminal or lock, thats fuking awesome. Gives you loot, chems and exp while doing your first steps. Imo, should be 1st pick for any fresh player
---
&gt; Either way my biggest complaint is just let me equip broken armor.
---
The point is that we shouldn't have to do a horrible workaround like wearing broken armor. We should have perks that mimic some of the armor perk when we're *not* wearing armor.
---
Mutated Chicken butt
---
Evidently
---
&gt; could be a full health broken chameleon sentinel set
---
Why? Answer: this game is on an antiquated engine that was never meant for this type of game. There is only so much they can do.
---
Absolutely. Was the first card I took; no doubt in my mind the best legendary hands down. And only one rank necessary, so no need to waste coins ranking it up.
---
I like this a lot except for the mutation alterations. Those don't need to be touched in my opinion.
---
Ok, you're right about Unyielding set being easier to get these days but so is excavator power armour or any other power armor  for that matter. 
---
If we had two characters with one having uny and another having excavator,  excavator will surpass it. 
---
H
---
155 base carry weight + 100 excavator bonus + 100 calibrated shocks + 10 motion servos + 25 radicool + 40 strong back + 75 carry weight from 15 special strength = 505 (power armor itself doesn't have carry weight when equipped)
---
155 base carry weight + 75 Unyielding + 60 deep pocket + 25 radicool + 40 strong back + 75 carry weight from 15 special strength  = 430 (probably less carry weight available because normal deep pocketed armor is heavy when equipped ) 
---
Unyielding only surpasses in carry weight when back pack is added to it like +120 , making 430 + 120 = 550 
---
Power armor should be given it's own unique type of "backpack" like the bullet containers for miniguns and gatling lasers back in fallout 3. Or a special type of compartment that acts similar to the backpacks in f76 that can grinded using gold bullion. 
---
Although Uny does offer xp bonus , AP and perception.  Power armour has advantages such as 42% damage reduction,  no fall damage,  rad protection and heavy gun armor penetration. Both have their own roles .
---
 Even with serendipity,  you  can still die pretty quickly with Unyielding.  So that massive stat increases justifies the risk taken . The new damage model has decreased the damage bloodied used to do so the risk is a bit higher .
---
...Humble brag?
---
I've gotten nothing so far. Be fucking grateful.
---
If you aren't playing stealth than the best commando weapon is a railway rifle
---
My weapon preferences haven't really changed. My top 4 weapons are the same:
---
* Vampire's magic combat shotgun (kills level 100 muties in two vats hits)
---
* Vampire's magic minigun
---
* Junkie's explosive minigun (also magic)
---
* Instigating +40% power attack reduced weight grognak axe
---
Can you define “optimized”?
---
I’ve posted a few times requesting help optimizing my build, few responses, though I think my build is pretty solid for my class (stealth sniper), but again, stealth is 100% eliminated this far from daily ops. Not nerfed, eliminated. That’s even before discussing weapons nerfs.
---
Same as before:
---
* Commando - Mutants Handmade with +10% damage when aiming.  
---
* Heavy Gunner (normally my unarmed build) - Supressors Explosive .50 Cal Gun
---
* Sniper - Instigating Sniper Rifle
---
* Medic - Two-Shot Combat Shotgun with +10% damage when aiming
---
I do 4 uny 1 bol on my melee character. I have 5 uny pieces but the bol I have has w/r chems and food and I need that since I dropped thuru-hiker for 3-2 levels. I ultimately wanna drop it to 1 or none but I’m a food build now cuz of the nerf lol need that.
---
two months later, i have this problem on pc
---
good ol bethesda (I moved house before turning in the case thats prob the issue I think I read it elsewhere before)
---
Good question. Tldr: shotgun/melee better than shotgun/rifle.
---
"Guns" is not specific enough I guess, as there are 6 kinds.
---
Shotguns and Heavy guns are Strength-based. All 3 melee are Str also.
---
Rifles and Automatic Rifles are Perception-based.
---
Pistols and Automatic Pistols are Agility-based.
---
Because it's costs levels to move SPECIAL points around, but no cost to swap perks, it's a good plan to use weapon perks from the same SPECIAL if you're set on multiple weapon types. 
---
So, to your question, my feeling is more that melee/shotgun/heavy is easier to build effectively than melee+other.
---
I feel very strongly that you should play the way YOU want, but... With this week's patch, Combat is a bit unforgiving, meaning its current important to have some amount of your combat setup built well. 
---
In my opinion, weapons need at least 6 points for decent work. Rank one of each weapon damage perk plus the max armor penetration perk (ex. Rifleman1/ExpertRifleman1/MasterRifleman1 and TankKiller3: gives 30% damage and 36% armor ignore). Each further point of Rifleman increases by 5% rather than the 10% for the first rank. If you're going multiple weapon types, I would choose BloodyMess (general 15%) before full rank each specific card.
---
I'm rambling... I'll see if I can try to riff on your link and add a second response.
---
218ish
---
Is that why my teammates in power armor outpace me? I share squad maneuvers and they are just ever so slightly faster than me.
---
Yes to this, I love pistols and only love pistols have gotten was recently the tank killer works with pistols now.
---
With the legendary Infiltrator perk those two cards are pretty much obsolete now. At rank 1 of Infiltrator you auto-unlock all rank 0 locks and terminals and can still pick and hack all others!
---
If I see a camp with a pet spider that’s where I’m aiming my next nuke
---
I use a VE Gatling Plasma (for far away, don't want to blow myself up with splash damage), VE lmg and a B50L90RW minigun.  I also made a set of secret service armor and kill a lot of things very quickly with the GP. I'm a full health vampire build and rarely have to use stims.
---
Thank you.
---
Exactly, complain complain complain....so many people complain. If you dont like it, move on...personally, I keep at it, and nobody is forcing me. I see no other open world RPGs out there that keep my interest.
---
Party boy/girl. I use person to keep it gender neutral and avoid confusion.
---
Nice work! Handy to know. Humans being on par with ghouls was news to me.
---
Changing your build in FO4 was as easy as just equipping a new weapon, so it was way more forgiving towards changing things up for any given boss or dungeon.
---
I remember taking a ton of explosives to kill Kellogg and just unloading mini nukes and missiles as soon as he started speaking, even though it had nothing to do with the way I normally played.
---
Just started a new character and lvl 1-20 took some getting used to...there is slightly less gung-ho firefights, and a little more patience, stealth, and explosions. I have been killed twice...once by a pack liberators around lvl 9, and once by the scorched/mole rats in Gauley Mine (though that might've been lag :)).
---
I havent invested in any damage perks yet beyond bow before Me and Archer and so far it's only 1 point in each perk
---
When you are close(ish) to the ground, give yourself a boost to even SLIGHTLY adjust your upward momentum. Fallout calculates the damage you take from a fall from the LAST highest elevation you were at. Jump, fall for a sec, boost, fall, when close to the ground (body length or two) BOOST again to go a tiny bit up and land like a feather! Sometimes you will die if bloodied so give yourself a bit of extra health if the fall is really high. Lag will get you too now and then. (edit: typos)
---
That's funny because I play the game with whatever the hell weapons I want and seem to do just fine.
---
Cause rare outfits will become very common, then people who own them will be annoyed, I do own the tattered field jacket and seek a leather coat and people have given away quite a bit to get them so in a way it will be unfair if you can just kill a random raider to get it, I personally aren't fussed but others will
---
Mod for PC with 12 slots came out a month after the game launched
---
There are some videos on YouTube but are you looking for a particular piece of apparel?
---
I run herbivore mutation so eat and drink soups, so I cook and sell all the meat I collect. I can usually get half a days worth of caps just from selling cooked meat picked up while playing.
---
When ?
---
Well the best way to do avoid confusion would be to call the perk by it’s actual name like you just did instead of making up your own terminology.
---
Not worth a legendary slot. Unequiping costs coins
---
Hacked laser gun, hacked laser gun
---
Generally I could see the fight coming and would choose to have it or not. But basically any building you enter will have something potentially. Usually I would choose to have it, and only back out if it wasn’t going well.
---
I like this idea, especially for quickly switching between cards since there's no custom loadouts yet. 
---
Some noob might think, "oh wow, there's a lot of cards!" but trimming the fat looks sexier for us high levels. I like to quickly switch between Demolitionist and Gunsmith whenever I need them during events. Don't get why it wasn't like that in the first place as it would make Charisma sharing 5 star cards ability even more useful.
---
I wish I could even get the outfit! Lol
---
I disagree. Someone might not realize that the perk changes names depending on what gender your character is.
---
Thank you for this. I was holding off on my final legendary card because I didn’t want to waste coins
---
Not sure what the rare stuff I should be looking for is I probably put in 12-18 hours a day and do a lot of shopping so I’m curious what would be good to spot
---
No, I'm just saying you're wrong in a slightly obnoxious, but also kind of deserved, way. Fo76 is way more client-sided than you seem to believe. Use Google, as you advised the other guy, and you'll see. Check out .esm-editing and e.g. the third party software called er3ctu5
---
It does do damage though. Unless they changed it
---
It did not reset !!!!!!!! This is BULLSHIT !!!!!!!!
---
Looks sick. Too bad it’s a mod on PC.
---
This.
---
Do you make sure to aim at their face, I realized you can headshot with a melee weapon recently and it really helps with the damage.
---
Same BE15 gat plasma, B2590 LMG, BE90 cal.50 and B2525 fixer.
---
Bruh, my monitor is aof 1360x i dont remember, and the max option the game gives me is 1280 :v
---
Wait the lore actually states they’re extinct? Just not appearing in the other games doesn’t mean they don’t exist, but I’d be thrilled if they were canonically extinct
---
Agreed. It’s so fucking stupid that if you want even the most minor of things, everyone asks for shit that only Dupers would have access to.
---
Scorchbeast Liver + Carnivore + Strange In Numbers = +7.5 Luck (30m)
---
Duel wielding pistols and melee weapons would be awesome but I don't think the programmers at Bethesda are capable of such a thing.
---
I just got three of them from capturing workshops. I just loaded them in my vendor for a cap a piece
---
I was kinda surprised as well. Ghouls, Scorched, Humans, they're all drop the same XP
---
Ha! I didn't even notice the quest marker taking me in there, I just assumed it was pointing me to Wren. I always just hit the tinkers bench in the airplane and move on. Learn something new every day lol
---
I agreed, they shred! Pipe revolvers are the only ones that are truly viable tho right? The western ones are just too slow and weak. I haven't tested automatic/pipe pistols yet either
---
Hmm. The challenges have reset but the ops remain the same.
---
I'm travelling to Crater for free to compete the mission already ;)
---
I just traded my stuffs to get this full set buddy !
---
Yeah, it was the "not knowing" that made Season 1 more arduous than it actually was.  I ended up finishing it on like day 45 out of 70.  The reality quickly set in that, yes, I could have taken a lot more time with it. 🤣
---
YES. i absolutely love pistols and having the ability to go akiimbo in games makes me so happy we need this
---
Math time. Againe.
---
At level 680, getting 3.6 perk coins per level, plus 50 from the level 50 challenge, plus the 16 coins you get from the two extra packs you get before level 10, you should have 2514 coins worth of perks, theoretically (not counting any packs you got from Legendary Run or challenges).
---
Since you used 1200 to max out four perks, that should leave you with 1314 coins worth of perks left, which is 657 perks/perk ranks.
---
If you have 56 perk ranks equipped (might have more if you leveled up Legendary SPECIAL perks), you should have 601 spare perk ranks in your bank. So if you count how many ranks you actually have, you should be able to find how many perks you lost.
---
The ones in skyrim weren’t that bad just unnerving, probably helps that they were pretty uncommon and weak. As an arachnophobe those weren’t to bad and I never had problems with the spiders in WoW but the ones in bloodborne were horrible, something about the way they’re designed or move can make them not as bad
---
Thanks for letting me know about this. Just yesterday I got the quest to track down nuclear codes, and I really haven't gone to many of the blast zones. This is good to know and I will be keeping an eye out!
---
Agreed. 100%
---
If you are team leader, you can kick them from the team
---
So explosive over FFR now?
---
I like that the game works like that too.
---
I already do use the Workbench in the Gun Shop. This thread is just about rationalising the mission target.
---
Yes! I got a 2* Bloodied and a 3* AA one last night!
---
Have you seen the mods for fo4? The engine is  good enough. My suggestions are very easily implemented. Maybe not the fast travel glitch, but the others are very doable.
---
Whatever you do, don't use bow or crossbow, they are not even viable at higher levels.
---
And don't loose hope when you are between lvl 20-35, some missions are not meant to be done directly.
---
:D
---
I haven't found anybody with a set to trade! Lol
---
Once you get the plans/items you want there isn't much need to do them, especially after the damage nerf. I used to solo Earl with a bloodied pump action, but not anymore. The big winner here is daily ops. After I get my elder completion, I run that shit solo for ammo, xp, and a guaranteed legendary. Way less work, resources and time than acp or sbq.
---
It was my Furious/25% VATS Combat Rifle, but then on day 2 of OWL I did an op and got a Vampires/+10 Aim/25% VATS Fixer, and that thing rocks.
---
Furious seems much weaker in this patch. Maybe it's purely anecdotal, but it feels like the damage ramps up slower than it used to.
---
Casual testing between my new and old gun shows that even though my old gun *should* in theory get to 50%+ damage (~72 + 36 = 108 per shot), in practice things seem to die around ~90 damage per shot. Conversely, my Vamp's Fixer does a base ~90ish per shot, so for most mobs they're dying a little faster. And since it's +10% when not in VATS, I'm already doing around ~100ish per shot when not VATS'ing.
---
So net/net, the Furious effect isn't ramping up fast enough to out DPS the Vamps, and the Vamps has the benefit of healing me. I haven't tested it out on anything bigger than a level 100 Glowing Behemoth, so it's possible the Furious might work better against stuff like the SBQ and Earle.
---
Ok, didn’t realize that one since I play with herbivore. Still, it’s a good option for players who don’t use carnivore.
---
Really wish Bethesda would add in game trading a reality for us. Heard other games do this.
---
Nice idea. Not sure its quicker for me as it would need a second load screen compate to using the Gun Shop but good thinking! :)
---
Molerats. So annoying.
---
either map them have low HP, or have them stop fucking burrowing. I'm fine with tough molerats if you limit their burrowing.
---
But dogs are still really easy....so its weird you're complaining about the wild dogs....
---
The day I launched my first launched my first nuke solo, (a couple days after just returning back to 76) I was greeted by level 75 colonel gutsies. I switched up between heavy guns and fury induced melee along with melee induced edibles and my fire ax.fuck them all
---
This has been happening forever. Scrip Farm honestly. I keep the veg at my camp and know where the radstag spawns are. I load up and rinse and repeat!
---
In Finland they have a completely free education system including University, even for international students.
---
How has that lowered their standards?
---
Well i traded 1by1
---
VATS has overall been well known for being broken with gauss weapons. I know exactly what you mean, even when the shot says 95, the shot goes straight over their entire body. I'm assuming it's just some kind of glitch, hopefully it gets fixed soon
---
I think you should be somewhere ballpark 16 , but there is no need to rush it we found that out last season you can miss about 3 weeks worth of dailies  and still pass it easily . 
---
Just because some people are hard-core and want their stuff now doesn't mean you're behind .
---
Its all G my guy.
---
I don't know why you got downvoted lol
---
If you are a more casual relaxed player, you can probably get away with only using normal damage perks.
---
Try out Sweetwater Special Blend. It won't work with Happy-Go-Lycky, but Party Boy + Herbivore + Strange in Numbers brings the Perception up to +15
---
they said that will be added soon. cant remember where sry
---
That is the price you pay when using different monitors and playing in Fullscreen.
---
It's the age-old engine that can't handle multi monitors correctly.
---
The only work around is Borderless Windowed.
---
I see, thanks for the input but that's i think where the 10mm submachine gun shines, the bullets are littered everywhere, i'm not even trying to collect them but i somehow have almost 8k in my stash.
---
also, no worries about the solo'ing a boss, I would never dream of it, if anything else, i like playing in groups after i finish my dailies.
---
I didn't know it, but thanks for the heads up. I'll stop liking it now.
---
You shouldnt need any other cards really 
---
. Much better as leg than regular taking up 6 slots
---
I'm still not getting your point. I said it happens at same time to all current players, and you are saying that this also happens with all platforms, so this is an update issue and maybe even server related? This didn't happen before P22.
---
You could wear the secret service helmet or a miner helmet. There's also a few things from the atom shop that have the bright light too.
---
But thats about it .
---
Yep, I’m aware of that one and mentioned it on another comment. It also stacks with other alcohols since it’s technically a tea.
---
*Drops "You're the Dumbass" note*
---
yeah, but instead of going for your usual handmade or fixer, i'd like to spice things up by using a 10mm submachine gun instead. xD
---
Someone would definitely not realize that your talking about a perk when you don’t actually name the perk. Action boy/girl and party boy/girl are the correct way of naming the perks while including everyone and anyone who didn’t know would immediately figure out. Not making up your own name.
---
I wouldnt worry too much.last season I bought the last 10 ranks and felt like an ass because the next 2 weeks I still had dailies but no reward.
---
most anything clean.
---
How do you join someone else's daily op?
---
Wouldn't need to implement a second trigger. If the pistols fired in alternating shots, you could hold aim and then repeatedly pull trigger, each pistol being pulled into aim position, true gunslinger style. Reload may be an issue but could be solved by both pistols being holstered simultaneously and reappearing loaded after brief (albeit invisible) reload duration.
---
You are saying it's on my end aaaaand it happens all players at all platforms TOTALLY AFTER patch 22. Yup, I can say all nope I want.
---
That's a damn good idea.didnt think of this
---
Always slows down when there is new content.  They still happening but there is other things to do again.  They'll increase again.  I still kick them off and see others as well.  Just this morning I joined a server that had a Earl already run so I hopped on a team, kicked off a SBQ and was able to get in both on one launch.  Very nice.
---
TSE gat plas
---
Yeah. When we finally get perk loadouts I might drop the Legendary card, but for now it's awesome.
---
Agreed. My big peeve is why does every mole rat, cockroach, and dog need to be 50 and above? They are on par with a lot of bad guys. To me, there's really only 3 bad guys: melee, energy guns and projectile guns. Then there's a bunch of skins. Nothing sets the enemies apart anymore. A cockroach could very well be a super mutant with a sledgehammer.
---
Did you try to set the resolution in the config?
---
I’ve used this before when talking to other people and I’ve never had confusion before. Both versions work just fine for most people.
---
Im not locked into a build? I can swap along the lines? Didn't know that! Thanks for the input!
---
You're extremely close to discover that demand and offer fluctuates over the years.
---
Rad toads in the mire actually scared me the other day. Was going around and collecting workshops and one had some squatting radtoads. Walked up to melee them and a single attack knocked 1/5 to 1/4 of my health away.
---
An hour after challenge reset
---
I feel like Instigator was nerfed.
---
Pistols need so much love.
---
Dual wield, fan fire revolvers from the hip for firerate bonus, anything!
---
Ok thanks, although I always enjoyed pistols and shotguns in Fallout games , ill try for something melee based for the start. Thanks for answering !
---
I just finished updating Alcohols info on the wiki. Everything what works for each perk should be available. 🙂
---
The game also does this when you only have one monitor, I just gave up and use windowed borderless.
---
So the builds are easy to swap whatever my level is?
---
Berzerker should be hands down the best DPS build in the game.  None of the other builds sacrifice as much survivability, yet bloodied and junkies do more damage.
---
Thanks for the quick response!
---
Just checking, did Bethesda fix the low FPS Tesla bug?
---
I know it's in the patch notes, but Bethesdas patch notes are not always the most reliable.
---
(just don't want to bring my Tesla back out only to ruin everyones day)
---
Same, client restart fixed it. Super frustrating.
---
I use [this](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html) website to track my progress. Another member of this sub posted it.
---
Ill take my time. Thanks for the info mate.
---
It does seem like it should either be tradeable or like some other plans in the game that once you learn it you can’t get it again as a reward (which I believe is the case for the mounted SBQ). I’ve not got this plan yet, so far have only got 2 plans and recon outfit, but can imagine its a bit annoying to get it multiple times and not be able to do anything with it.
---
You had me at ghouls, lost me at super mutants lol. Ghouls would make sense at they are still essentially just humans, super mutants are far too large and it wouldn't make sense for super mutant sized power armor to be a thing lol. But it would be crazy seeing a feral sprinting at you while wearing power armor
---
Real life ticks do definitely seem worse, but something about the way spiders look or move... I don’t know we don’t get to choose what scares the life out of us. 
---
But we already have ticks in 76 and honestly once they’re this big none of that probably applies anymore. My friend brought up that ticks probably wouldn’t even attack humans once they’re that big
---
I have instigating lever rifle. And ts vats handmade. All vanguard ss gear. All the right perks including sneak perks and bloody mess. Definitely not one shotting even with stealth so I have no idea what game you a holes are playing. I run a full health build. I like to run support in events, like reviving ppl. I just don’t like bloodied and I shouldn’t be forced to play that way. 
---
This is my best build. My stealth vats shotty build has worse problems with the vats issues and rubber banding n shit. 
---
Doesn’t mattter though. I’m done with this game. It’s redeeming quality used to be the community and even that bums me out now
---
Wtf removing that perk asap
---
Thank you for doing that, then!
---
Now if only we had an intelligence boosting alcohol, alcoholics could buff every stat (I personally think scotch could work if it comes back at some point, with an agility or perception penalty).
---
People who don't play the game and get spammed with "buff power armor" posts on their forums every day for 2 years
---
get a pc, Fallout 4 GOTY is usually around 20 bucks during steam sale.
---
I would call those dupers.  
---
As massive as it no doubt looks to normal players 1k-10k flux is pretty reasonable all things considered. Good farmers get around 50 stable flux for a nuke which lasts about 1.5-2 hours. When you consider that some people have been playing 2 hours a day most days for months... not even mentioning how flux is considered a caps replacement for high value trades.
---
Never used a vampire gun just junkies and bloodied but I got a vampire ffr mini gun 2* and it does work especiall with these daily ops..my b hm does good but not having to use stims ever is a nice payoff
---
That's a different fish iirc, it should only happen when you choose a different resolution than what you run windows at, or if windows runs at a non-native one.
---
Hasn’t happened to me yet!
---
😀😃😄 I know the feeling
---
Thiiiiis, you can get some good caps from the Point Pleasant area. Plus water farming along the river, and thanks to OWL all the cultist should be dropping higher level guns. Sell or scrap those, depending on your need!
---
I think that would be cool, but if we wanna go full gun slinger the reload animation could just be the character spinning the pistols briefly. May be a bit too cartoony for fallout, but I think it could really work.
---
And for both balance purposes and easier coding I feel like if you were to duel wield they would have to be the same pistol type and should work a little different for auto pistols.
---
&gt; Wait the lore actually states they’re extinct?
---
No... I said they don't exist in the lore, in the sense that an e Whether they are actually extinct or not is therefore unclear (at least to me, if someone has more information on this, please do chime in), and leaves an opening for Bethesda to have some spiders somewhere, without people complaining about retcons.
---
As far as horses go though, since I mentioned them as well, I think they *have* actually been mentioned to have gone extinct, but I'm not 100% sure about that and I'd have to look that up.
---
Hahaha. Barely notice a difference tbh. Can still 1 shot most things. Tougher things need about 3 until adrenaline and gun fu kick in and then its pew pew pew
---
The bit of the ol' in, out, in, out...
---
Really good point, a nuke shouldn't be required to fight Earle
---
But you don’t have the Pirate uniform
---
Nice, I got some fusion cells to burn through!
---
Yea but a pc is like 800+ dollars
---
What I would give for corpses to be highlighted
---
Yeah I have a level 53 that I havent played in months.  Got on for one wasteland and can barely damage a thing.  I never had luck with legendaries so my character is literally using a base 308 combat rifle and combat shotgun.  I only have around 500 caps so I can't really buy anything from other players.  I just stopped playing, I'll probably be back again someday but I'm just sick of feeling so weak and not knowing what to do about it
---
I only have them to swap in to skip the repairing the reactor section of nuke silos honestly.
---
Two-shot 33 P combat shotgun (prime)
---
Or 
---
Quad 33 A double barrel (also prime)
---
Both still over perform in vats and have been over performing for over a year. Plenty of guides on using these kinds of shotguns 😊 
---
Lost like 20% damage off my junkies heavy guns.
---
So to sum up, you're saying you want a brighter light, but not any of the options the game gives you for a brighter light.
---
Give it some time..there is a guy that always drops the link.lol almost like he has it ready to copy + paste
---
We're only several days into the new meta. No one really knows for sure but it's looking promising so far.
---
gauss minigun the way you go
---
😆
---
OK thanks
---
Yeah, it's kinda busted. I find that if I charge up my shot before entering VATS, I have a better chance of it hitting. And even when it doesn't, if you fire again without exiting VATS it almost always hits.
---
There’s a word for dual wield and it’s ‘akimbo’
---
At the pool motel. I think when you fast teavel to flatwoods yountuen around and follow the road for like 50 meters
---
Yea, i only got 2 options, 1280, and 680
---
That would be a good addition. Most of the alcohols are redundant copies
---
Second response: Here's how I would tune your original:
---
[Sniper/Knife Hybrid](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cc71583&amp;d=s52si2sj2pd2pk2pl2ic4ar2pp2se2lt2cu0an2ao0a00ek1eh2ej1&amp;w=eo2ee2ss2i44li2cr0a12) , has 8 points left for Quality of Life perks of your choice. I've moved a few of the original perks down into alternates, like both Makeshift Warrior and Gunsmith are a lot of investment, even though you'll only be really using one at a time. Swap as needed. Also, each point of AGI will increase your Sneaking effectiveness, so that might be one you want to look into. Similarly, each point of STR will increase your melee dmg.
---
[More VATS (less melee)](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=af715c6&amp;d=s52si2sj0pd2pk2pl2ic4ar2pp2se2lt2cu0an2ao0a00ek1eh2ej1p02a72a30l12&amp;w=eo2ee2ss2i44li2cr0a12) , adds Concentrated Fire, Action Boy/Girl, Gun Fu, and Grim Reaper Sprint, taking 2 points out of STR to do this.
---
Looks like meat is back on the menu boys!!!!!!!!!!
---
I do like how ESO has their loot. You can set it so you loot one and everytning in the area also gets looted.
---
Does it have a different appearance from the old version? I picked up the gutter plan, and the new one has a very "stripey" paint job while the original is all a dirty assaultron blade. 
---
As for the reason, I assume it's how they're gonna reintroduce all of the old survival weapons, as plans you get through daily OPs
---
That minigun will make you damn near indestructible.
---
JE25 Handmade and J2525 Handmade. The Explosive is shredding everything tbh.
---
Uh Emergency Protocols is much better
---
Regarding ammo, 2mm is also much easier to make I’m thinking. 
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
I still don't really get how the season is supposed to work, basically you're supposed to abandon all other quests and storylines from the actual game right?
---
I don't think anyone would disagree that everything that isnt bloodied stealth commando needs a buff because using anything besides, bloodied stealth commando, you straight up don't do comparable damage. Even without stealth no build comes close and single shot/semi auto rifles need a buff to compete with end game builds more than anything else.
---
Yes please!!
---
Sounds like that would give melee a buff as it would only take 3 points to get what previously took 9 points... I’m all for that melee needs a buff
---
Some people jus tdd ignore it, but I've heard it's a new legendary perk that makes it happen.
---
Much of this is due to the cap limit on characters, and cap inflation. If you are at the cap limit or close what good is more caps? If an item you have is worth more than the cap limit due to inflation what good are the caps? 
---
Players will always find their own currency, when the existing currency fails in one way or another. In this case it is more a direct barter system because there is nothing of "value" that can be gotten for caps
---
Brutal
---
Love the spinning pistols idea. Agree with two of the same pistol. With aim for auto pistols, both could be brought to center and fire simultaneously. Reload could be a quick -drop clip, pop clip- for both pistols.
---
What are your other legendary perks?
---
As fun as it would be to design your own arena and fight in it, Beth didn't consider this at all
---
Started a alternate toon before 1wl and it definitely got easier after the patch.now the grind to 50 still is probably the roughest after you get your perks in it gets easy.i did have armor and guns but only after level 35.if your on xbox I can pass you a mutants handmade that got me to 35 also have some low level vanguard armour pieces that I want to pass down to someone doing a 1st playthrough
---
It’s the same thing with the fireman uniform. Tried the prison collar but it didn’t cover it all up
---
Would rather we stop receiving these in the first place
---
Well you're only locked in in terms of your special allocation. Even then not really but you'd be too far into the game and it's too costly to change it drastically. It pays to plan ahead.
---
Same too with the perk cards. They're flexible in that you can swap them in an out when you want but you need to have the cards and the free slots to be able to do so.
---
You'll get the gist of it pretty quick. I wouldn't sweat builds for like the first 5 levels or so but while you're between 5-10, you might want to look into a build to suit your preferred playstyle and work towards that.
---
God that would be amazing.
---
I wish they were just unlockable skills instead of cards.  You unlock it and you can just do it.
---
&gt; the 308 mg is pretty great too but chews through ammo way faster
---
The recoil is also a bitch to handle.
---
Bloodied heavy build?  Yeah, you're using pa.
---
I'm actually loving the game more than I have in the 1.3k hours I've put in.
---
But sure, since you don't enjoy it nobody does
---
An hour after the score challenges reset
---
in a hour after challenges reset
---
I’d do a bloodied pistol build, VE autolaser pistol in one hand and BE autolaser pistol in the other
---
Are you sure, I feel like most non melee players play first person
---
Legendary Charisma, Legendary Agility, and Master Infiltrator for those wonderful quick bounties.
---
I'd settle just for some way to reduce the weights on my rifles. I can carry 4 heavy weapons on my heavy guy for 1 rifle on my sneaky guy. Thats a bit bullshit.
---
It'll be in the GeForce Experience menu.
---
Yes and no.
---
You don't have the classic skill system as in Fallout 4. Instead you get perk card that you can swap around.
---
The SPECIAL Points you get for the first 50 lvl are harder to swap, but possible.
---
The higher a SPECIAL attribute is the more and perk cards you can use for that attribute. You can exchange these perk cards at any time for any other perk card you got.
---
they are useless if you are a non-bloody build, but very useful for a bloody build. jetpack is more constant for it's usability
---
I see , good to know. Thanks again for helping me out.
---
I forgot the /s
---
I apologise to the Bethesda employees who got upset.
---
As long as your weapons and armor are close to your level you should do fine.
---
yes
---
Because everyone would have to regrind fro all their stuff.  What do you do about legacies?  I would kinda be mad if the top tier weapon I bought literally yesterday was now useless.
---
So its pretty open-ended. Great to hear. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Thanks! I just added Concentrated Fire 3 and dropped Skeet 🤞
---
Just saw this... means I can put my survival tent to the far east and have a fast travel point north, south, west and east. XD
---
👍
---
You can get a good amount from daily ops if you have a gun equipped that takes it honestly the best way to farm ammo now
---
At the very least, some new animations. Give each rank variant of a damage perk a passive something, example base gunslinger gives you nothing, expert would unlock quicker reload, master would give you the fanning(increased fire rate). Assuming Bethesda doesn't blow up their code implementing it, dual wielding as a master variant. Character does the twirl (gun spinning) as they draw or put away the weapon. Base damage perks are someone learning at a range or reading Manuel's, expert  is them facing real world combat and learning from it, master would be you are one with the weapon. Something to show your character's progression, as they gain skill with their selected weapon...as the perk card text seems to imply. 
---
As for duel wielding in general, utilizing the current control set up...I feel it may be very clumsy with the way Bethesda does things. As a melee character I would love to see my character do more than two different types of attacks, three if you count the sprint...you know like a combo. Slash downwards a la vanilla animation, slash towards the side in a wide arc, another light attack ends with a thrust. It's nice to dream right?
---
Gauss mini for sure
---
Personally I don't like master infiltrator, so I would replace that with it, but if you think taking one for the team is more replaceable, then go with that.
---
Yea its crazy someone traded me a BE90 Gatling Laser for the spec ops suit 🤷‍♀️
---
Thats not at all what I said. I stated that I'm aware of the RMH and asked if there were any other options. For example the ability to increase my overall game brightness, a mod for my Pipboy or even other mask. But you go ahead and be snarky and condescending Im sure it will serve you well in life. 😒
---
No protection needed 😉
---
No. Builds are not easy to swap. It will cost you a chunk of your character to swap builds.
---
You start at 1 pt for all your specials (stats). Each level allows you to up 1 point, up to 50. After 50, each level allows you to change 1 pt, but you only want to do this occasionally as it will eat away at your legendary perk coins.
---
The gist is this: the more you level up and allocate points, the more "locked" into your choices you become.
---
At lv 1, you have no build since you have 1 pt across all stats. By lv 50, what you end up with is your "build" - and you'll have to waste pts on fixing it.
---
Try this: go to the top of this sub and type in the search bar "meta". Start reading from newest until your brain hurts from knowledge.
---
Thing about a lot of these "what do I need to know" posts is, you need to read a lot. Hours and hours of reading. There's too much for us to repeat to you in this thread without you putting in the effort to do your own research.
---
Triple tap, OK I'll give that a go 🤞👍
---
Oh okay! Haven’t played more than 1 ops yet. 
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Probably for the same reasons we don't see 4 or 5 star legendaries...despite the stars being there.
---
I have a B2525 10mm smg that I LOVED before the patch. I wish I could say the same now.
---
Throwed it into my stash and I don't have any plans in using it again.
---
Apples and oranges really. The gauss minigun plays like a more powerful minigun, the plasma caster is more like a more powerful gatling gun. Downside of the gauss mini is the ammo consumption, it pukes ammo. Downside of the plasma caster is a slow fire rate and it only holds twenty rounds. Both are good weapons, just for different things. If you want a boss type gun, I'd go for the mini. If you want something for overland or adds I'd go for the plasma caster. But with one wasteland I'm not sure how well the plasma caster still performs. An instigating plasma caster seems like it would be good though.
---
I had a 7:55 run earlier this morning... Solo no less. Cloaked is certainly challenging
---
Fireproof offers fire resistance while dense doesn't, right?
---
ah ty so much
---
You can keep repeating them and get legendarys and ammo lotta fun imo
---
OK thanks, fully charge before entering VATS, will try that one out  👍
---
May have told people how to do this, but thanks for the heads up.
---
Wish they could be sold to shops like other grenades.
---
Still seems to be effective for me...
---
I've switched from rifleman to commando and had a bloodied explosive lever-action that I've since stashed.  I've also stashed my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and don't really run melee any more.  I'm liking that I don't feel like I'm leaving damage on the table if I don't run a bloodied gun and trying some other effects.  I do think melee and slower fire rate weapons feel a bit too weak for my liking right now.
---
My current weapons:
---
* Quad-Explosive Railway, tons of fun but ammo is a problem.
---
* Bloodied handmade.  I might be switching it out for a quad-25% ffr handmade and see how different they are.
---
* Bloodied explosive minigun.  I also have an AA .50 cal when I don't want to be stupid with ammo.
---
* Vamp-explosive combat rifle.
---
* Magic combat shotgun.
---
There's already a range of enemy levels you see: 50 to 100. And I swear I never want to see a sub level 50 enemy again.  They aren't worth my time.
---
Well isn’t the point off mmo/Rpgs to constantly be improving and grinding for the next big thing?  
---
Personally I don’t see the problem legacy weapons were took out for a reason I’d assume. You’d still be able to keep them and they’d maintain their effectiveness. 
---
I’m just saying if they want to buff enemy health and levels while leaving us on a playing field that’s tipping slowly in the games favour each should we still least be given slightly more powerful gear as compensation?
---
I made another alt after One Wasteland which will probably turn into my main eventually because I screwed up my main during wastelanders and didn't do any raider quests at all. So im redoing everything. My alt hit level 30 yesterday ive had a few issues but thats due to my weapons being too low level and some enemies not scaling (seen a few level 60 glowing ghouls) 
---
I will say its harder than before the update but nothing I can't handle. If I where new to the game I would have a few issues especially if I was newish to gaming or this type of game.
---
Are we assuming it's 100 days long?  If so you can just do the math yourself.
---
Did you enter the Morgantown highschool?
---
dense is for explosive damage not fire
---
edit: asbestos is for fire
---
Thank you , that is exactly what I was trying to figure out. I had never been part of a team before
---
Dense makes you basically immune to explosives while Abestos Lining makes you immune to Fire.
---
One is for the Queen, one is for the Colossus.
---
I’ve wondered I’m like level 115 now and it’s always bothered me that level 50 is the Cap for weapons and that I’ve never seen higher than a 3*
---
It crashed in the middle of talking to a level 200 guy 😔
---
equip and throw. much faster. you dont have to be aiming at anything
---
They’re mostly useful for nuke launches, as having level 3 on both allows you to bypass the harder sections of the silo
---
Silo run aswell
---
Hope he does !
---
They would be op pistol builds can already hit up to 2k per hit with some builds having that go up to 4K plus a sneak crit of 8.5k with perks would be to much
---
We ran SBQ like 5 times in a row yesterday lol just remember after getting ur loot..be cognizant of the enemy stragglers so they don’t get u..but we also had camps set up near fissure to just unload all of our junk
---
This is a big part of it, if there isn't anything of "value" for caps what good is more caps? Many mmos solve this with cosmetics, mounts and pets etc.. but that cuts into the atom shop.
---
Junkie Build time
---
They asked what's best, and bloodied is best
---
Sorry to hear, my game has been crashing a lot more since update 21, update 22 hasn't improved that unfortunately 😟
---
Legendary perks help.  Although I know they were meant to come out before.  But never in the game has another star come out or a higher level.  My hope would be that if they do increase levels they scale all your current weapons to roughly where they should be.  So if the new max is lvl 100, you multiply the level of everything already by two, so my lvl 50 guns are still good.
---
same here.   I ranked it up all the way and have zero regrets.  its amazing how many doors and terminals I instinctively ignore because they are locked and I dont want to take the time to switch loadouts to open them
---
nuke silos take half the time too.  This is a GREAT addition
---
For me, it’s the Quad dildo
---
Well it’s clear it didn’t work now and you also didn’t name the perk correctly. Only one version actually uses the perk name.
---
Wdym
---
&gt;If we had two characters with one having uny and another having excavator,  excavator will surpass it. H 155 base carry weight + 100 excavator bonus + 100 calibrated shocks + 10 motion servos + 25 radicool + 40 strong back + 75 carry weight from 15 special strength = 505 (power armor itself doesn't have carry weight when equipped)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;155 base carry weight + 75 Unyielding + 60 deep pocket + 25 radicool + 40 strong back + 75 carry weight from 15 special strength  = 430 (probably less carry weight available because normal deep pocketed armor is heavy when equipped )
---
It's funny how you twist the data to suit your argument.
---
You're talking a very best case for PA vs not the very best case for non-PA. If you're going to compare apples with apples, you either go with the best case for both or the average case for both.
---
In both of those cases, unyielding wins handily. Using your own numbers, either 430 vs 405 or 550 vs 505. Unyielding wins in both cases.
---
It's not that PA need it's own backpack, it's that unyielding is too OP. People have been saying it's OP for well over a year and it's clearly demonstrated as such in practice, being the bloodied meta pick over what would otherwise be a sensible bloodied pick - bolstering.
---
We all know that unyielding is insanely OP for not really that much of a sacrifice in terms of health. Could be a little different now since a lot more things punch back even harder, even then there are countless examples and evidence to show, even in the new meta, that bloodied builds are resilient. It's not that much of a cost to go low health, especially considering ALL of the synergies that you get it.
---
&gt; The new damage model has decreased the damage bloodied used to do so the risk is a bit higher . 
---
You say this as if it's meaningful in any way. 
---
Bloodied is still top tier in terms of damage. It's just the gaps closed considerably between it's next rival Junkies. Instead of one shotting most things, now you're 2-3 shotting them.
---
Bloodied aren't suffering that much. As I've said earlier, I say this as a bloodied main myself.
---
I don't care if we get more carry capacity overall. All my point is that the problem isn't that power armour is too weak in that regard, it's that unyielding is too OP.
---
Second shot for gauss shot usually hits but i miss the first shot 90% of the time. Upsetting since none of my other shotguns ever miss.
---
I’d like that too it’d make my non auto rifle more enjoyable again. But I don’t mind using automatic guns since I usually just play a sniper build. Mixing it up is fun!
---
I hear ya. My BerE Fixer is going to collect dust in the stash now.
---
I wish Party Boy affected Ballistic Bock. 45% extra damage uhhh yes!
---
Sweetwater Tea gives a massive boost, especially with Herbivore with +14 Perception
---
You must be in a private group to build at camps.
---
If i where to join your private team i can go to your cmp and build 500 picture frames which would require like half an hour to remove them all.
---
tired of no one caring outside the fo76 world that he doesnt like the game, so he has to come here where people equally dont care, but are forced to navigate his whining anyways
---
Yup, same.  BE15 gat plasma best before, best after.
---
bloodied and anti-armor weapons
---
I still see most people running bloodied so I think you'll be fine.
---
If you run the fireproof perk at 3*s you'll barely notice explosive damage.  Combined with some dense mods and you can eat grenades for breakfast.
---
I still run 5\* Adrenaline and 3\* Gun-Fu and it works great as a target acquisition + damage buff for me personally for two reasons: 
---
First because my PC is old it's sometimes almost impossible to aim because of the frames dropping to 10-15 in a fight and second because I use the Fixer which has quite the recoil :-)
---
In Daily Ops I can sprint around full speed and instantly taking out enemy after enemy (as long as I get them acquired in VATS, heh) and it's hella fun, in those I can play the game as a shooter.
---
That’s good info mate. Thanks!
---
Yeah it’s a tough choice lol. Don’t really have much gold and I’m still grinding for t-65 PA. 
---
So I would’ve bought both if I could. 
---
Tbh I think I’m more of an explorer than a boss type player. So Plasma was a good choice. 
---
But crafting the cartridges also seems like a lot of material-runs.
---
you don't need to, bloodied are still max dmg builds
---
Patch 22, which was four days ago - combat rifle plans can be used on the Fixer now
---
(I really wanted the dark matter paint, but I didn’t start last season until it was way too late)
---
If you are talking about "option" you haven't tried using the config file.
---
I’m reading that now too. But, from what I can tell, you still have to turn pacifist off.
---
The other option I've heard was xp for your gun.  So as you kill stuff for your gun, it can level up with you so you don't have to throw out good guns that are low level.
---
Bloodied is still some of the best then huh? Thanks!
---
I mean I get what you’re saying, but if you came right out the gate and killed a LVL 5 super mutant and got a mini gun at lvl 5, that might just be a lil too easy
---
I still one shot enemies with my be build?
---
Nothing has changed. The gaps have just gotten smaller.
---
Melee was hit hardest, single shot rifles next so
---
The best builds are still commando and heavys
---
Oh actually thought they were 1 per day. 
---
Don’t know why I never tried lol. I just assumed I guess haha. 
---
But thanks for the help. I’ll go try them out ASAP.
---
nice and easy op thank you
---
Ah, well. If you were on XBox I’d be glad to walk you through it.
---
Yes.  As long as you have pacifist on, no one can hurt you.
---
Rngesus still blesseth. I haven’t gotten a single rare reward and have completed elder every day :(
---
&gt;I'm hearing rumors that bloodied was nerfed pretty hard 
---
You heard wrong. Yes it did get nerfed but all builds got nerfed so while the massive damage number is less massive, you're still doing the most damage compared to other builds.
---
Bloodied is still king and PA has always been good. Change if you want but it shouldn't be because some other build is better in the meta.
---
There needs to be a way to remove your wanted status without having to die to another player. I've heard that always running Infiltrator can auto unlock things in player camps and cause a eanted status.
---
Finally a nw I don't mind doing
---
Thanks for the update!
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
Now that actually sounds better I like the idea the more you use a weapon the more skilled you become with it making it more effective. Even if it was a new legendary effect
---
I’ve seen many people say you should get and use both interchangeably - I got the Plasma Caster first because I like it more, and I don’t have the reputation for the mini gun yet
---
Yeap, there were 2 Super Mutants in the ground floor corridors, 2 in the Canteen/Kitchen, 1 in the changing room, 2 in the gym and 2 with a Boss upstairs.    
---
I heard the scorched and muties shooting as I entered, so waited at the door till the shooting ended and went in.  All the scorched dead and muties unhurt.
---
So many stupid irritants with Colossal Problem!  Ran it last night with a decent rando group.  We had Earle on the ropes after a good 10 minutes, and something killed me when he had a tiny sliver of health left.  I respawned, jumped down the hole, and landed just as Earle died.
---
Can you guess what happened next, as I had just fallen down the entrance hole?  The devs coded an instant kill due to falling rubble, if you are in that spot when Earle dies.  So I died again, only this time (since Earle was dead) I spawned in OUTSIDE the mine.   I got rewards for finishing, but couldn't loot his body or any meat piles.
---
Man, I hate Bethesda sometimes.
---
Not at all. I found my bloodied pa heavy to be the least effected of my toons.
---
I can 1 shot lvl 50 radroaches with a bash, so that's good.  Also critters don't level padt lvl 5 K think.
---
I think rifles just need a normal weight reduction perk, I’m pretty sure every weapon type in game has a normal weight reduction perk except rifles, on my rifleman/commando character I have to run a set of at least 3 legendary armor pieces with the reduced weapon weights effect just carry some of the rifles I have
---
we will still be able to play it if thats what you mean.
---
Yep. Time to boot up NW for once.
---
Yes, FO4 was more versatile than FO76 for adaptability purposes.
---
Was actually thinking about that as well. 
---
I’m just sooo low on T-notes and I’m still grinding for that t-65 PA. 
---
Might buy both when I can (in a few weeks) lol. 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
You can switch perks around. Where you put your SPECIAL points is more important, because it requires one level up to move a point of that around, but with legendary perks you can also add on more to your SPECIAL if needed. Perk cards can be swapped in and out, and you get a perk pack every 5 levels (as well as from season rewards), so taking a perk you don't end up using later on isn't as big of a deal
---
If we're going to get floater grenades as loot, they should act as any other loot and be droppable, tradeable and sellable.
---
I think it's with al energy shotgun's because I have a Tesla shotgun and it has the same problem.
---
They tend to be a bit off at a distance - like, if the quest is directly north, it might show it as more northeast until you get closer
---
Yup. Then you could seamlessly add level 100 weapons to the game, but still make all of everyone's current weapons viable as long as they play enough.
---
The only thing that dictates what type of rare reword you’re going to get that’s all after you complete it under 8 mins you’ll only get the basic rewords and a small chance of getting a rare item
---
Oh, weird, never had a problem with it.
---
The glowing one was free in the atom shop during the event
---
Plasma casters are kind of a short-medium range heavy sniper rifle. They hit hard but shoot slow.
---
Same I went from “oh I’ll just play here and there to see what rank I get” to “I NEED THE SUBJUGATOR OUTFIT ASAP BIG GRIND TIME”
---
Tell me more my friend
---
I found that the blood eagles are really weak to heavy weapons, in particular the minigun and my two shot flamer - I was able to complete yesterday’s op with only 1000 5mm rounds, and when I repeated it for experience, like 300 flamer fuel
---
Not only are the daily ops easier, but depending on weapon you can actually leave with more ammo than you started with.
---
And this was posted in the Fallout 76 sub, why?
---
Nope, continue as you were.  Every modifier took a hit, bloodied was the biggest.  So now all builds are closer together in terms of damage output, bloodied still on top.  
---
If you were having trouble staying alive, stepping down to junkies with full health isn’t nearly the step down it used to be.  Best to just try it and see how you feel about it.  Some players hate the nerf, others are having a good time.
---
Cool , never happened with me but it still can.☺️
---
Thats an understatement. They got bent over a barrel and butt f#@ked.
---
Yeah it would really support The fallout 76 daily limits I’d probably hit all my limits just trying to level up a sweet new piece of kit!
---
You have misunderstood what's going on. The current generation version of fallout four is coming to next generation for free. They are not releasing a next generation  version of fallout four.
---
I mean if we have to upgrade for the next gen consoles
---
Think about the 100s of hours you will be playing and enjoying the game to get that level 70 Vanguard SS Chest, while rolling the dice 1000s of RNG times for a new *** handmade ...... and the opportunities to buy more Atoms all that time will afford.
---
Probably because of that massive boost, that’s why post-war alcohols are unaffected by the perk.
---
Though it would be nice if just that one and high volt hefe were ignored.
---
Just to let you know, I started the game as rifleman and ended the game as a heavy gunner, all in one character.  You can definitely drastically change your character, just takes a bit of work.
---
Yes you did
---
fml thanks so much
---
Well I should know that the cool items always come in Atom shop only.
---
To bad for my caps. Thanks for the info
---
I agree, they were way weaker compared to the robots and super mutants of the past ops
---
The whistle in the dark has the same stripy paint as the new gutter
---
sorry that should be the nar repair yard not trainyard
---
oof
---
Isn't that the chance you take in all MMOs?  Look at WoW.  T3, T4, T5, T6, T7.... It doesn't make it obsolete, there's just better stuff available now.
---
/u/Valseek there is a bug if you are in an op when it hits the reset it carries over yesterday’s completed status to today. 
---
Really sucks when you get 0 rare rewards every single day.
---
Also the distances never show up for me when I get close to the marker.
---
I have an anti-armor one that’s really effective on basically everything that isn’t a boss (it’s a 3-star, but the other two effects aren’t anything interesting)
---
Lots of different ones! I hope I can find someone selling the jack'o'lantern plans! Been on a hunt for the past few weeks.
---
So basically you want to undo all the damage changes and dumb the game back down to one-shotting everything. Right...
---
Haha yeah I do the same during events or daily ops for when enemies are gonna be appearing
---
Nope, limit of two weapon levels per day per weapon.  Why Bethesda?  Oh and how about this?  Only up to level 50 weapons drop, in order to get them to 100, you *have* to play with them.
---
Awesome. Thanks guys!
---
Yup!
---
Weird.  I don't have those problems
---
The chances of this are slightly less than 0.1%.....so less than 1 in a thousand
---
I’ve seen the terms a lot, what’s a B2525? I think B is bloodied, but I have no idea what the numbers mean
---
Yeah heavy weapons seem to give a lot of delays like stim pack usage
---
That sounds perfect. And I don't think they would need to balance anything, just add the damage and legendary effects of the two pistols together but also treat them as different guns. And yes I do not see having technically 6 legendary effects together as an issue cause pistols suck and they deserve to have SOMETHING.
---
I have similar hot takes for bows, crossbows,broad sider, and single fire rifles.
---
Said hot takes goes as follows:
---
Bows, crossbows, qnd single fire rifles have the same hot take which is: Triple head shot damage with perks that increase that. Rewarding accuracy for single shot weapons should be a no brainier since without that unique feature they become shitty dps weapons.
---
Broad sider: chance to make enemies rag doll for a period of time. It's the only way I can think of it having some utility.
---
Level 100 cave crickets in project paradise are a nightmare
---
berry mentats didnt work .  hmm
---
Love the design choice as well. I often don’t bother with legendaries in events because everyone gets skittish about killing it.
---
It's simple, you give them a "pistol" (a 105 howitzer), and let them throw out enemies from their shopping cart instead of rocks
---
An enemy spawned inside a wall in a daily ops, i was able to nuka grenade is through the wall and still able to win.
---
 However it cost us elder rank as if we figured out what to do.
---
That might not be too bad
---
The other day I did one with robots that had to be killed with melee, and it was kind of torture - took me and my friend around 15 minutes with our somewhat average builds
---
For me .... I say get on with it so I can get a gun that kills a friggin Mutant Hound on the first stealth, covert opp level 3, shot, so it doesn’t howl and alert the whole damn MOB of level 100 super-tank-mutants with level 100 Armor and guns down on my Solo-player-ass.
---
Haha yea I know there are different types of pumpkins but I noticed in everyone's camp I come by, all pumpkins were glowing while the ones I bought don't glow. That's the core question.
---
But yea I was very happy to find someone selling the plans for that cheap haha.
---
What who said that? I asked why isn’t there guns suited for higher level players I didn’t ask for this to be dumbed down? It’s a question not me demanding.
---
I used to have a camp near whitesprings, constantly got spawned at enclave bunker
---
First star: B = bloodied
---
Second star: 25 = 25% increased fire rate
---
Third star: 25 = 25% less vats cost
---
🤣😆✌👹☠🧟‍♀️
---
Read the ops description and you’ll know why sneak is useless.
---
"Awww, yis, that Super Mutant has a minigun, now I can get some ammo!"
---
*drops a hunting rifle &amp; .308*
---
I'd say go for the special ones that give you agility or whatever.
---
Oh, cool, thanks
---
Yeah, that sounds pretty good even if you *don’t* have a specialized build
---
All this talk about 50 cals makes me want to do the quest line today!
---
I guess I know where one of my nukes is going.
---
I use a mutant plasma caster it would one shot high level scorched in a nuke zone with a surprise attack before the patch. It’s my go to gun when farming flux ingredients as I’m creeping around in my Chinese stealth almost armor. You definitely want to prime it ASAP. It makes ammo more doable
---
Yup, the hunting rifle is meant to be bad, it's an early game weapon, you have to consider that and get a later game rifle.
---
I just wish they would just do it ..... I want a weapon that kills little things easily.  Playing Solo with everything being a bullet sponge is tedious.
---
Yes that’s what happened to the OP I’m gonna surmise. It just happened to me too. 
---
F****
---
Wh... where does the fourth one go?
---
Just tested and it doesn't work
---
According to a few other players it is possible with another legendary perk but I don't know what perk that is. So for best results use pacifist unless actively looking to pvp.🧡🖤🧡🖤
---
Laughs in heavy gunner.  You're kidding, right?
---
Lol at the stupid asshats downvoting you. 
---
Can’t wait for them to get screwed over and learn the lesson the hard way.
---
Yea, this idea sounds amazing. It would definitely make things alot more interesting. The same thing could apply to armor - hey did that raider just revive himself from the dead due to a life saving armor piece?
---
Wait is melee less buggy in 3rd person or something?
---
It’s not only dumb but it’s literally game breaking for certain players.
---
I wouldn’t mind if their was a mod added that allowed you to rev up heavy weapons
---
Isn't Liquid Courage a post-war beverage? I'm sure they didn't have a bunch of Wendigo Colossus walking around in 2077, but this post says it has the effects tripled by Party Boy, so?
---
Use google, it's faster as I'm not near my pc.
---
You’re right but daily ops LG to much
---
Bethesda did a blog on it-
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview
---
You don’t need to sneak, just sprint to each mission marker, activate the thing, stand and wait and shoot enemies till the bar fills up, sprint to the next point.
---
Still I would enjoy that for an extra like 1-5 damage per level depending on the weapon type. I would put up with using that gun all the time if it was one I enjoyed using
---
Just thinking about it makes me want to die
---
From one heavy gunner to another 👍
---
Yeah, I remember putting on the barb wire thing on the barrel and just rushing into combat ripping people apart without having any ammo, was pretty fun ngl
---
I guess update 20 was a small portal to a better place.
---
Did you favor all 12
---
I knew that there was one that was specifically atom shop that glows really bright. But I believe all the rest were in-game. 
---
I wish you could 'light the candle' so to speak and make them glow brighter though.
---
I think you make a good point of weapons that are considered underwhelming, and rarely used.  Why bother with a hunting rifle when you have a combat rifle, handmade, and lever?   
---
I could really see a boost to the black powder weapons, the revolvers and hunting rifle.   I’d really like to do a gunslinger build, but you’re gimping you’re character doing so.  Heck, even with the boost that pistols get from tank killer - my 10mm still feels very underwhelming.  
---
I have an AAE Hunting and guess what?  No one what’s to buy it.  Because the DPS is slow and .308 is expensive to craft 
---
So yes, I agree 👍
---
Is it possible to get rare rewards more than 1 time a day as well?
---
I’ve not spent much time doing melee but I found it be easier
---
As a pistol packing mama, take my upvote.
---
Pretty much every other team based thing is global, so I assume so.
---
Thats why I switched to my AA .50cal.
---
Now I just stand in the middle of the battles and pretend I'm a turret.
---
Pipe revolvers count as rifles and pistols? Thats wild!
---
I thought pacifist on was pretty routine for events.  So easy to tap a player, especially with an explosive legendary
---
Well if the BoS declines the inoculation there's gonna be a whole new Scorched problem
---
I've been there, i'll search it thoroughly tonight when i'm on.
---
Nope you are not alone. I’ve had the damn beach boys bouncing around my head. I literally only clicked on the post to thank the author for the ear worm lol
---
Huh, guess I should try that.
---
Ok thank you.  Was getting a bit worried
---
Yeah, I enjoyed not crashing, felt like a different game 😋
---
Heavy weapons are a lot of fun for me in special ops because I don’t have to worry about ammo... you’re pretty much a turret when defending the uplinks
---
Shhhhhhhh \s (only when modded with a rifle stock)
---
I’m pretty sure you can you just need to be lucky  but if you want 100% certainty look on YouTube or on the sub
---
I would too.  I guess the problem would be that some people use a lot of guns and this would make them feel like they have to choose between them.  So maybe we could pull a pokemon and say any weapon you aren't currently using, but is in your hot wheel, also levels up at 25% the speed of the one you actually shoot.
---
Nothing has been announced yet regarding F76 and next gen AFAIK.
---
I think they’d be insane if they didn’t offer some next gen upgrade deal with, I dunno, power armors themed after the PS5 and Xbox X designs or something lol
---
see it as a daily dungeon. enemies and location change, but the goal (repair repeater, boost uplink a, boost uplink b, free a specific zone from enemies, kill boss) is always the same. depending on your time, you get rewards, rare plans only when beating it in under 8 minutes.  
---
for now, all daily ops enemies have a mutation which increases their percetion, so sneak isnt possible. also they have another, daily changing mutation (can only be killed by melee attack, freezing attacks, explosion on death,....).  
---
you can try it as many times you want, but the highest achievments can only be earned once a day.   
---
enemies drop ammu of the weapon type, you use.  
---
the timer starts, when moving from spawn point, so take your time to check perks and buffs.  
---
after the boss is killed, you can loot enemies up to 5 minutes (timer in the upper right), then you get teleported to the place where you started the daily op. (without seeing the final results so do that before the timer runs out)  
---
if you see "(in Daily Op)" behind a teammates name, fast travel to him to join that daily op, by clicking on join from the daily op menu on the map, you start your own.  
---
i certainly forgot something but that should be it. in general, its not that hard. do a recon run and take your time to check out the location and then go for your run and try to beat the 8 minutes.
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
Next time please read the post. Or even view my profile I enjoy one wastelanders and longer fights with enemy’s but you can still one shot enemy 100 levels with a level 35 shotgun. 
---
Also damage calculation works like 5 + 5 now when it used to be 5x5 If anything it has been dumbed down already.
---
The survival chem generator is also a godsend. I no longer have to farm food or disease cures
---
Will do. Thanks for the help mate!
---
For damage increasing perks weapon wise it goes like this
---
Upgrade Strength if you like melee, shotguns, and heavy weapons
---
Perception for semi auto and auto rifles, as well as bows/crossbows
---
Agility for pistols 
---
However there’s other damage increasing perks or accuracy/stealth perks in perception and agility, intelligence also has explosive damage increasing perks as well as a perk that increases heavy weapon accuracy while in power armor
---
Bloody mess under luck also gives a nice damage boost
---
And the tenderizer perk under charisma can offer a damage boost as well
---
This isn’t really a build guide but a short outline of what special stats to boost as you level for particular weapons that may want to use, realistically its best to focus on one weapon group as you level, once you start to hit level 50+ and 100+ you can really start tweaking things to fit multiple play styles optimally
---
Here's a better idea: what if heavy weapons didnt need to rev up? Since Fallout 1 through NV, the miniguns have been a specific model, the Rockwell CZ53 mingiun. They didn't need to rev up, you pull the trigger and they begin firing. These guns used to have history behind them, and had been seen in all the Fallout games until 4 and 76 came along.
---
Only the same knowledge that is available to everyone else through Google or the Fallout Wiki. I'm tempted to provide links to the latter with my feedback in case they don't know where to look, but I'm always worried that my posts might read in a condescending way.
---
Concerning adjustments I'm of the opinion that they wanted to release the full nerf and then gauge the feedback from the entire community rather than limit themselves to just the PTS community which is likely to have mostly min max players in it. I fully expect adjustments to be made in the coming weeks. I just hope they're good ones.
---
Ah, noted! (Your secret is safe with me)
---
Yup.  You don't really have time to kill enemies anyway.
---
Yeah mine is usually on but I'll forget to turn it back after beefing with a griefer. Honestly thank goodness they put in that "I'm sorry" emote for those times! 🤣
---
Yeah, the pipe pistols are nice because they use up .38 but they don't have the same benefit as the pipe revolver and bolt action (also too slow imo)
---
On that point, we will have to agree. bloody is still the best when it comes to overall damage if you can look past the lower health pool. guess it will boil down if they want to run bloody build. or any of the other types out there. 
---
i will still swear by my jetpack though, mostly because i am a Vampire's PA heavy gunner
---
First time?  You get the cursed weapon as a reward for completing.  So you actually missed out on a drop from body which are never cursed.
---
Yeah a good ol exp share on my magikar... I mean my anti armour hunting rifle
---
No argument here.
---
Only issue there is that we are in an economic crisis. I can’t just go out and buy a PC. Who do you think I am? Hodd Toward? Smh. If I had the money I would but I gotta be smart right now.
---
I just can not care about these mods
---
There is super mutant who wears specially designed PA for him. He is notably larger than everyone. He appears in one of the previous Fallouts games.
---
It’s a perk so you can mod the pistol and it requires two pistols and if it’s legendary the perks stay
---
It’s fine. I agree that it would’ve been stupid to just tell people to turn pacifist on to avoid pvp - like duh. 
---
I’m keeping Take One for the Team card equipped though cuz I’m pretty sure it’s why I can one shot enemies that attack me first.
---
Grenadier use to effect E weapons, not sure if that's changed. It was some time ago that was observed.
---
Well now I need art for this
---
Not being able to use a suppressor is why I never bothered with the smg.  The recoil kinda sucks and the default iron sight I dislike.  I think a well rolled 10mm pistol outcompetes it imo just for versatility
---
Bloodied, than anything else at 20% health, than junkies, than whatever.  If you want to try bloodied but are scared about dying, use a vampire's weapon at 20% health.  You still get a ton more damage but also have a ton of survivability.
---
I have 6 bloodied black powder pistols I saved and move to an alt.
---
Rev sword is cutlass enough, i use the starlet sniper.
---
I wish I could swap them fast enough ...
---
Alright thx, gonna search it.
---
unless you go against the 4chan hive mind and piss someone off. also if youre going to be a royal douchecanoe just make a throwaway.
---
Right?
---
Not sure but I am at rank 22 now and haven't logged on for the day. I play the int game and farm xp 4 mirelurk queens = 10,732 plus the mirelurk spawns near them. This patch made XP so easy especially if you are stacking buffs and lunchboxes.   
---
My personal goal is 3 levels a day minimum and that seems to more than cover what will be needed.
---
I get that but you must admit that that trailer looks great considering it’s a full mod built by fo fans.
---
I feel like if heavy weapons had no rev up, it would be game changing for heavy gunners! But I understand why they have the revving up mechanic. Cool fallout history I didn’t know about, thanks!
---
Well it's 2 hours from him posting and it's +14 now
---
No problem have fun farming 👍
---
I'm with you on this I throw all the ammo I pick up on my vendor for free. I also generally will list any legendaries I think someone could use for super cheap for a few days before they get turned into scrip
---
Yeah, I know. My guess is that it could be a post war version of a pre-war recipe.
---
I misread your post. Sorry, nevermind. My bad.
---
This feedback is as strange as it may look for some, is exactly the feedback that Bethesda is currently looking for, thank you for making it.
---
Seems that all the glowing ones are atom shop items sadly.... Now I have to merge candles into my empty pumpkins. Let the work begin lol
---
I love the glowing ones. I was last night at a witch camp at the mire which looked incredible awesome cause of the glowing pumpkins.
---
I hope they will them back into the shop
---
Okay, so I think we've fixed the game.  Good meeting, by the way my name is Todd Howard and these changes will be immediately put into the game.
---
This just absolutely isn't true, or you're getting shit luck in servers. I jump into ACP and SBQ often, did them each about 3 or 4 times over 2 hours of playing last night. Both events are still pretty much packed.
---
People mistake missing out on being in the initial group of ACP as the event being dead because they ended up in a group with 1 or 2 other stragglers.
---
The toxic community doesn't help
---
Look at how much hate im getting for simply saying this patch is bad 
---
Y'all can go ahead and keep circle jerking tho lol
---
I know, it crashed when I was respawning so I wasn't there for the event completion and couldn't reconnect to the team to get back in the same session
---
Definitely I think all the weight reduction perks should be another legendary perk. Especially now that I need all.my damage perks on to really play. I ended up been a food build just because of all I was carrying. I'm still at like 400 with all 3 weight reductions on.
---
No. Every mandatory lock or terminal is rank zero.
---
I'm going to take it on an alt just to see.
---
You cannot move a camp without "packing" the whole camp.
---
If you nuke it they will come. 🤯
---
If only you were really the holy Howard
---
Bloodied heavy weapons definitely got hit "the least" because of the way the patch worked, bloodied is still great.
---
On a side note, pick up the electric absorption legendary perk, it makes you immune to energy damage while in pa essentially.
---
I actually hoped to see more posts like yours. I'm glad to hear that players running QOL cards can still have a good time with these changes. From your experience it would seem heavy weapons are a great option for those who aren't caught up in build optimization. We all have the choice to play the game the way we want and thats a good thing. Hopefully BGS can find a balance, so all players can get what they want from 76 whether that's casual, meta PVE or PVP. We all should be able to enjoy this game in our own way.
---
Same, I can only seem to get 8:01 - 8:12 while running solo. 😭
---
i knew it! new update, new fucking glitches, more shity than the last ones
---
Totally, that card is a monster with my "Magic Johnson" Q3315rl DB and "Magic Mike" V3325lvc combat shotty...hits like😱
---
I am.  I'll prove it, these changes will be implemented by tomorrow.
---
Indeed it is. I think thats because the game thinks the item is outside my camp. If i place a new flamingo next to this one (inside the zone) i can remove it as usual.
---
Its only one FU but im always on max budget.
---
They are not shared, wish they were.
---
As long as you do the objectives!  Higher levels can kill but the x4 bonus is key.  If you’re not with the team - then don’t bother.
---
A big ROF boost of hunting rifle and lever would be more fun but wouldn't work with the animations. There's already the Gauss for one shot kills, though I find it's explosive projectile annoying.
---
Most players aren't griefers though.
---
I’ve run into dogs and bugs at level 50, even in Flatwoods.
---
I like the idea that the scorched, miners, super mutants, and robots “get smarter” about dealing with a higher level player but a mosquito?
---
Survival Shortcut gives you a free syringe every thirty minutes (quicker as you tank it up) that completely fills your hunger and thirst bars, heals you to full and cures one disease. It is astoundingly good value even if you just take it at tank one, as it allows you to dispense with all of your carried food and water and any associated QoL perks you may have equipped, which you can now swap out for more interesting options.
---
What Rads is just really useful and again lets you dispense with the need to carry radaway and possibly even rad ex depending on how far you tank it up. 
---
The “enemy dies and may cause an explosion” LP’s are actually quite potent, but explosions going off all the time can be quite jarring.
---
The lockpicking/hacking one maxed out is a game breaking for me. To walk up and hit x on anything and just have it work, fantastic.
---
Sadly no they’re not, and also I don’t know why they can’t be. Maybe in the future they could possible add that?
---
NM I was on the wrong toon
---
It needs to be 100% damage, and it needs to be tied to number of armor pieces worn,  not DR.
---
The only thing the patch made me do was to switch my auto prime receiver to the auto hardened receiver, 'cause I ain't wasting ultracite ammo for this dingdong
---
You're right the glitched explosive heavy guns did shatter the best stealth commando time I've seen so far. I didn't do my research since patch 22 and I apologize :-)
---
Well not more shitty just an inconvenience. One wasteland has been quite fun for me tbh...like I never thought I would be so terrified of mirelurk spawns 🤣😂😱
---
Yeah I have a path I run to do all the Wastelanders dailies in about 15 mins. Although haven't been doing it lately so sick of them always complaining to me.
---
I hope and I pray
---
Did you get some from the Season 2 rewards? Those get claimed by the last character played
---
If you want one spesific type of ammo (you can use different guns and ammo types) you could just farm a dsily ops when an easy one comes around and have enough ammo for days or weeks.
---
Doesn’t mean it should be a bad weapon.
---
Oh yeah, I stayed in the area and we always had the x4, except for about 30 seconds when someone died. He was back like greased lightning and despite my lack of power, I was able to help by throwing grenades around.
---
Personally I feel (and maybe I’m wrong) that the best bit of the legendary perks is the ability to add special points. You can round out your build with qol perks we all stayed away from in favour of damage and vice versa for those that love to farm. I didn’t add all special but you could add 30 special point to your build and that is big.
---
Not that they’re tough - actually, the opposite. But it just doesn’t make any sense that they magically get tougher.
---
And then it’s a boring ammo suck to deal with ‘em.
---
Does the plasma caster have any firing delay?  The gauss mini bugs me trying to kill adds because it takes a second to spin up.  I keep falling back on my old .50.
---
Yep. 
---
ACP should give more time to loot and escape.
---
I always get rid of those
---
They shouldnt merge tiers but rather merge damage perks across weapons. There is no reason semi auto and full auto pistols should scale with different dmg perks when they are in the same SPECIAL, same applies for rifles and melee (in fsct there is litterally ZERO reason to separate 1h and 2h since they share all the same perks minus dmg).
---
Having to shoot a Mutant Hound 2 or 3 times instead of killing it with an easy stealth shot to the head to avoid being mobbed by 10 level 100 super-tank-mutants with guns and armor that clearly out class mine by at least 40 levels, makes me feel like I’m back at level 20, and want to die.
---
Well damn.. :(
---
Yeah it has “all” and “featured” tabs so I assume that’s hunting more will be put in there. I expect expeditions to be one of those things.
---
I LOVE THE NEW UPDATE !!!
---
Equipping a perk to help detect them helps..a lot.   Knowing an area and where the spawns are also helps.  I know Camden Park really well from doing daily events and from the Mole Miner event.
---
For now just leave it be I guess.
---
Fireproof offers both explosive and fire resistance
---
The AA legendary variant is pretty damned good.
---
No and  Also it won't happen
---
They don’t like to work properly inside.
---
You have to claim it? I thought you inlock it and bam presto you worked for it now its yours
---
Imo, it does.  They're are many things to upgrade in the game, one of them is weapon selection.
---
Pray to your almighty god Howard .
---
The mobs are infinite. Stay on the uplink and get it done. Even as a melee character the freezing effect isn't super bad.
---
I think enemies in the forest need buffing. The biggest disappointment I've found with the update is that there are still low level areas. I let a bunch of ghouls at Morgantown slap me about for science and they were doing a sliver of hp and 5 rads a hit, no different to before the patch.
---
It's fine.
---
The servers struggle as they are and you want more players on here?
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd like that too but this is Bethesda we're talking about. It's just not going to happen, even if they wanted to.
---
Yes, at 50. But as I pointed out why is it that farming is more often than not a better way to get ammo than crafting it? Doesn't that say something about crafting not being good enough when in reality it should be the primary source of getting your ammo if you want a specific type, not finding a place to farm it. Also the other main point of my post that I'm guessing you didn't read/see is that this is all for a level 50. A new player is going to have no understanding of any of these options. The low ammo rates and only means of getting a good quantity of ammo being at lvl 50+ is a huge problem for new players.
---
I feel like most of those weaker enemies are still pretty easy to kill.
---
#reverttoupdate20
---
The lesson was don't put the exploit in your camp. I'd have like 4 of them running underground at workshops. Placing them in your camp was obviously a bad idea.
---
* Best gun before One Wasteland: Furious Handmade
---
* Best gun after One Wasteland: Furoius Handmade
---
Exactly how it should be ✌️ It’s easy to get lost too if you’re not familiar with the map.  I think generally people work together in the ones I’ve done.  Completed one as a level 38 with only one other person.  
---
Not having enough stimpaks I think will be the reason low levels fail.
---
(I’ve always gotten Elder too - being able to tank enemies as you run to the next objective is also key).
---
This has always been the Fallout 76 way. back in my day as a FO76 noob, we only had 400 storage space and the guns were piss weak. the slog through 20-50 was unbelievable hard. 5.56 ammo just didn't drop in the wild. no purveyor as well, i didn't get my first usable legendary weapon until i was 60 something had finished all the quests and even then it was a quad handmade.
---
I want to be able to sell ammo for cheaper than 1 cap each. I think itll solve this at least a little. With new ammo output I think I can do 4 bullets per cap and just max it out at 10k bullets per day per person.
---
Yeah the robot spawns are Insane. It feels like its 4 times as many as the others.
---
Thank You.
---
Got turbofert? Some grenades and throwables show up as weapons
---
Thank You for the detailed description I think I have an idea now as to what to do.
---
Not really. I pretty much used the PA guy as a meat shield.
---
I honestly believe survival shortcut is the development teams answer to this question, because taking (and I have) effectively removes the survival aspect from your game for the cost of one LP slot (which seems more than fair) and does so in a really elegant and simple way. More importantly, it’s entirely optional: when Beth first floated that idea community feedback was mixed. So introducing Shortcut allows the community to opt into or out of the survival play style, and on Beth’s part they no longer have to do under the hood work to remove the survival mechanics and/or change how all the food and drink items and perks work in game.
---
Just got it and it bugs out your PIP boy light by making it a third or half of what it should be. :(
---
The mobs won't stop coming until you finish the op, make sure your always doing the objectives otherwise you'll just be fighting constant enemies for no reason.
---
Honestly? I’d like this, but then I have no idea what I’d do with my other 10 points of perception. I guess I’d equip sniper and have a rank of one of the collectible finding perks.
---
Regardless, while this would be pretty good for all builds, this helps pistols especially, giving them space to equip the other powerful agility cards finally.
---
I did not claim it crap so I guess I miss out after working to get it
---
My understanding was the future-tec camp had been fixed, the only people have issues with having to rebuild camp were people who had exploited with things like the ammo factory
---
Interesting.. I think I will go and do Beckket's quest today
---
Happened to me by accident. Dude didn’t even mean to, I died instantly.
---
I hope they think to put out all of that stuff well ahead of the 31st of October so folks get to enjoy 'em.
---
The candles look amazing merged into the rack pumpkins aswell if you're looking for something else to try!
---
Ugh, i been looking for a je mini forever lol.
---
I rebuilt my camp yesterday, haven't used the ammo factory.
---
My camp appear Grey on the map and my companion doesn't work.
---
Very few/no qol perks.
---
No weight,food/drink.  Everything must be for damage. 
---
Junkies/bloodied (not melee) as well.
---
As a rifle user you should have low str, no more than 5 int, low cha, high luck/agi.
---
Im looking forwars to whenever we get supermitants with the marsupial mutation.  Thats going to be fun
---
I have not gone into the files but last I saw
---
Vault 96 was going to be a raid similar to original V94, but a different theme and mission set
---
V96 was very close to completion (had voice files, mission parameters, and the rooms strung together)
---
V94 was scrapped due to server issues and crying
---
V94 was changed to the W+M1 snoozefest it is now
---
ITV/ patch notes (dont remember which) said V96 is being reworked to be similar to V94
---
"Carllll" "killing is bad carllll" 😂
---
Damn
---
It's very easy to farm lead if you really need it. Lucky Home Mine with excavator power armor and I can walk away with 1200ish lead after crafting with super duper. It takes less than 10 minutes once you've done it a few times and know where the nodes are.
---
Yeah man I was there for that too, and it killed off a significant portion of the playerbase. Just because it was tougher back then doesn't mean it was better or that there aren't problems facing new players in the present that should be dealt with to increase the playerbase. And the legendary comment is just flat out wrong. You get black diamond handed to you from a quest for one. There are others handed to you as well such as Sommerset Special. So this whole "back in my day we walked uphill both ways in the snow to school" mentality needs to die.
---
I killed him back. Left him to die in Emmett Disposal. Then I killed the Ghoul that crawled out.
---
Today I noticed I had like 30 of those damned grenades. Wish the days where you had to craft them came back.
---
I wish they would just make them tradable and then people can give them to me.
---
Yup. Daily ops is better for Legendaries, and the new Season takes a lot of effort to do your Dailies/Weeklies. less time for SBQ/Colossal.
---
Love the downvotes and no reply.
---
You mus be fun at parties.
---
Where is the OP located?
---
i honestly its because of pvp still being in the game
---
Casuals who enjoy this game have the right to do so. There has been plenty of complaining in this sub from all types of players and it's s likely 76 will suffer a loss of all types of players with the arrival of next gen consoles.
---
The how to was easy, the PvPer could just do it. The player getting killed would have no idea what was causing it which is the new legendary perk. Just wanted to let people know because some of use leave pacifist off to take care of griefers.
---
And Daily Ops when they roll robots
---
Another 50 year old "filthy casual" here with a full time job and other games that I also like to play, I don't have time for a career in Fallout.  My level 27 main is now pretty useless and I just spend most of my time these days puttering around my camp making water because I am sick of being made into pulled pork any time I encounter more than one rat. I do like being able to play with my level 8 friend now, but I wish there was at least more variety in how tough all of the creatures are instead of ranging from almost impossible to impossible.
---
😂🤣☠ like a B.O.S.S. 😎
---
Thanks and happy travels
---
Working of me after the patch.
---
I did notice that even before, it may not proc in certain situation, still need to figure out this situations, maybe it's not proccing if you have container at your cursor (the case when you cannot use stims with H key)
---
The Grenades, or the posts *complaining* about the Grenades?
---
I don't know but think Appalachian Vault 22 from NV
---
You can. I've already sold quite a few.
---
That jetpack is a real boon.
---
Yeah, I meant fire resistance (and explosive resistance) while dense only has explosive.
---
An ally would be so fucking rad. Give us an altar to place for them at our camp.
---
Vault 94. Swag. That’s the only one I can complete without blue screening at the last portion. Thank you.
---
At that point you are connected to the world though. I don't think game could handle loading screen interrupts.
---
;)
---
By underground do you mean like in a tunnel or literally under the ground and you can see the underside of the terrain?
---
Merge shotgun and rifleman. Merge commando and auto pistols.
---
They should add "Absenth" or whatever that crazy green alcohol drink is called
---
It’s not too late. If you forgot to claim it, or you never made it to that spot. You can buy it with gold now. I don’t remember if the guy at foundation or the raider at crater has it. But one of them sells it. I don’t know if you need to be Max reputation or not.
---
I really hope so.
---
Yea also a good idea!
---
I will do some experiments with the pumpkins. Will try several lights like the new planetarium light, a mirror ball, flashlight ect. Could be funny
---
The queen has better rewards for one wasteland.  The last thing anyone needs is more scrip from Earle.
---
Switch out some perk cards. Have a little fun. Roleplay
---
I wanted this outfit. Now if I get it I'd get endlessly annoyed... Like when I got the Stalkers outfit from the atomic shop and I noticed it had odd shoes
---
Agree that explosive weapons need to be rebalanced, in both damage and durability mechanic (they need to be per shot durability loss)
---
I always wish they added a long scope to the BP Rifle, and old timey scope, that goes from receiver to the end of the barrel.
---
I'm just making it to the photography quests lol
---
You should still have everything that was placed available without having to use resources. They should be under stored.
---
Faith in humanity: restored
---
Im so glad i live in Europe ...
---
I just soloed it in less than 8 minutes
---
Does it allow you to hit them back at all? I'm no slouch with a gatling plasma and I'd love to tango with anyone who would pull this on me
---
I am new and level 29 and my new best friend is an automatic 10mm pistol with a perforating mag and a recon scope.
---
With 2x guerilla it's taking 7 shots from stealth to kill at level enemies so far, and from a decent range at that. Bonus is there is 0 sway on the recon scope so picking enemies off is a cinch. 
---
Since the update this thing has been more effective than my first Fixer and I love it.
---
Eh? I just ignored most of the robots. In the reactor room you can stand on top of reactor. Use electrical absorption if you're having trouble even in PA.
---
In the other room, you have clear firing lanes on both entrances. Just stay near uplinks and tank robots for 7 mins :)
---
Once you're done buying whatever you want, start buying lunchboxes
---
That’s the thing, optimized seems to mean “you have to run bloodied/junkie”. I play vids to relax, not to become a micro-manager. I’ll fuck of now - thanks for the reply.
---
I feel your pain brother! 😆
---
There are 9 to 10 unlit Jack O'Lanterns, the 3 lit are ATX. There are also 5-ish pumpkin rack plans but the last empty one never dropped.
---
No it hasn't. It had dramatically reduced the need for optimal builds since they are much closer in performance to unoptimized builds now. Sure enemies are harder but they needed to become harder because the game was just trivial up until this point.
---
Agreed, just gonna avoid most NW challenges, except for "Use photomode" or "Deploy camp".
---
I might have to give that a try. I'm sure it wont be easy to roll uny for ss though 😭
---
If I remember correctly, the fix wasn't retroactive. Which means if you had the skin still equipped after they fixed it, you need to remove it, move your camp, then reequip it and move your camp again, to fix it for good.
---
Berserker's should of been the new Bloodied. Lowest defense, highest damage per second, but the gap in usefulness has increased so like you said, it's almost useless.
---
In my experience., my bloodied pistols is a lot worse and Tank Killer buff didn't help a lot. What was an excellent VATs build is now only about 66% of it. I needed to put in all Gunslinger cards to make up a third of the damage, but that's too many cards wasted so I don't shoot what's equivalent to a BB gun. I went automatic rifle + demolitionist combo to not feel and be underpowered at lvl 200.
---
Bethesda does not know how to balance to create unique class roles.
---
Berserker's should be Bloodied and Bloodied should be the half mark of having decent survivability and damage.
---
Think of it this way.
---
Bloodied: 50% health before diminishing returns, 50%+ damage
---
Berserker: 100% damage received, 75%+ damage
---
Instigator should be the only legendary effect that can apply double damage at first shot. I shouldn't be almost equaling that with a Bloodied build.
---
What Bethesda only achieved is create a new meta of the same level pre-patch. Some less used builds have become worse when it should of became more effective. I can't imagine where I could be without my Bloodied build. And some combos became better, I believe explosives retained a lot prepatch. I can clear out waves of enemies by myself in Radiation Rumble with my two shot auto grenade launcher Demolitionist Perk so that's my new "bloodied." 900-1000 damage per shot on 3 enemies at once is like doing 3000.
---
Bethesda didn't let things be tested more. What was target #1, trying to reduce Bloodied effectiveness actually caused collateral damage to builds that were weak already. I was thinking about running a medic build new patch, but the damage is awful for single play because they pushed loadouts til later when I believe we needed it before this nerf to test out some new builds.
---
bloatflies do drop them, you can also get it from the guano piles of SB's.
---
Its doable I just solod it (22s shy of paladin lol FML). I just wish the gutsy melee would stop being a "Ranged attack", definitely would be easier to solo.
---
yes but they didn't suit my playstyle and once you aren't specced for that you outgrow them pretty fast. i mean i think my somerset special was lvl5 it was redundant before the time i finished the next questline.
---
the idea that it's harder now than at the very beginning is nonsense and needs to stop. the more they add the more they will need to balance. this is a continuous process. all this ''the game is broken and worse now than ever'' whining after every.single.update needs to stop.
---
So if they kill you before you attack them back you don't get the option to seek revenge. If you are able to land at least one shot you can seek revenge or you know kill them.
---
sadly, yes it is
---
Unfortunately the NW skin doesn't work. You can equip it, but it doesn't change what it looks like.
---
Absinthe?
---
That would be an interesting one, and it was in Vegas. It boosted perception and charisma, so that would be interesting.
---
Not difficult at all, but requires some perk planning/optimization and gear adjustments.
---
Hint: Get yourself a troubleshooters armor set (even 1\*) and vampires weapon. There is no point killing, or trying to kill everything you see. You just need to survive until boss arrives. So even a crappy vampire weapon will do as long as it keeps you alive (fast firing / quick hitting).
---
Multiple characters and accounts. Not really a valid suggestion as such.
---
I thought it was available before the patch.
---
As a T-65 user, I can tell you you're in for a long wait.
---
Good to know. Power armor reboot, mysterious savior 3, first aid 3, born survivor 3 and some super stims should let me survive for a moment
---
In the future they may release ops for stealth but it makes sense that this op isnt stealth friendly due to its nature
---
Hi thanks for commenting but the problem is resolved so you may not worry!
---
Yes, they said they were going to make it happen. However, the NW skin doesn't work at the moment.
---
Or just let us build the nuke terminal at our camp and lower the price of imposter recall cards while we’re at it
---
Ahh ok, just wanted some insight. Cheers.
---
The ammo issues why I got Ammo Factory to 3 ranks like right away. Might only get 54 rounds of 2MM ammo, but better than what it was. Tomorrow I'm going to start hunting for crimson flux at vendors so I can craft a bunch of ultracite. I've got a Furious FFR gauss, so I plan on going through a lot of ammo.
---
I just wish the barrels were better. The faster fire rate of the triple/penta barrels does not offset the range, accuracy and damage (for penta) reductions.
---
I used to run [gapa.exe](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/gamma_panel.html), not sure if it works for windows 10. I like the default lighting but early on, that's how I could see in the mire (it used to be really dark)
---
Thanks for all the support, it's more fun in a group anyway (and easier)
---
I do mate. Are you talking plans ?
---
I started playing in January, never seen any Halloween stuff in a vendor yet...and I hop plenty. 
---
PS ID -  stov1es
---
Does Ultracite drop if you're using a gun with a Prime receiver? Or only base ammo?
---
Is it out yet? I've been hearing about this forever. 
---
Also I remember there was something about cars in it. Since it wasn't shown I guess it was removed. I've seen car mods before so I can see why.
---
One could argue dual wielding melee weapons, or even 2 one pump grenade launchers as a legendary perk.
---
Bethesda RNG. Technically you could get that plan the next 100 times you do it.
---
Honestly I like the patch. Wish there was a little more curve in the forest for low levels, but I will never get an under leveled legendary again. Uranium Fever gives me 3 level appropriate legendary items. Daily Ops are hard group activities that actually gives us late game content. It's not a fix all patch and more balancing really does need to be done but out of all the patches to hate, I dont think this one is it.
---
Nope
---
If you're in a daily op group play the fucking daily op. We need an auto kick on a timer if you are in a daily op group and don't load in to the daily op.
---
What it did is showed which stuff simply can't keep up and was carried by multipliers. Single shot rifles, every revolver, half of legendary effects, pistols all need to be looked at now.
---
Stuff that made game trivial still makes it trivial, get a bloodied Gatling gun for example and even without pa you are good to go. Commando doesn't even feel like it was nerfed for anything except big bosses, those take 3x time to solo now, which is 10min...
---
Huh?
---
My first instinct was to go SPECIALS. I figured there were more immediate benefits to my build over the other LPs.
---
You didn't get down voted for your opinion. You got down voted because you were a dick about it. You were the toxic one here
---
This is something an experienced player might know, but new players will have no idea about this. This also sounds nice, but 1200 lead won't last you long when you're burning 15k+ ammo from 20-30.
---
You need to pick a specialty. You have a nice handmade and Gauss rifle, so I would drop the shotgun perks in favor of the riflemen perks.
---
Why? You can make a build that might not make the most practical sense, but could be fun. Maybe you don’t do the most damage, but you could have all of those quirky perk cards, or have an ultra luck build, or any other way of playing.
---
go to huntersville. look in the meat bags. you'll find one in seconds.
---
Stopped doing Earle because frankly it shits me not being able to loot everything. Add to that the dumbass limit on how many people can jump in with you, meh. Queen on the other hand me and a friend did 3 times today and holy shit was it a laugh. The adds now spawn under her which freaked everyone out and made for a clusterfuck of explosives and tesla's. And everyone on the server showed up. Even got a colossus to spawn in the grove on the second nuke. Much more entertaining.
---
Hmm well anyway, I put Dark Matter skin on my fixer this morning.
---
Unlucky. I've been finding *more* if anything.
---
It wasnt rare, hell, they fudged the overseer questline with that guy youre suppose to take care of in the basement. You couldnt complete the quest for like over 2 weeks, or be the lucky person to kill him with his one spawn per server. There was even that guy who made like a 3 hour youtube video of "1000 glitches/bugs of 76" not too long after release. For a lighthearted view into fallout 76s crappy start you can also watch internet historians video on 76
---
Some dupe for RMT. Some dupe just because they can. Some dupe to help out friends. Some just want to see the world burn.
---
I remember the first very public dupe with the artillery CAMP object -- few friends and I duped some stuff for ourselves. Mainly ammo and some X-01 jetpacks.
---
Im suggest rolling one piece at a time. Look for ghoul slayers, mutant slayers and troubleshotter's (future proof daily ops). Scrap one star as you acquire two and three star varients. With ultra light i get more AP and can carry multiple set for different situations. U might luck out with Sentinal as a secondary effect.
---
That moment when X-COM soldiers shoot better up close at 95% is when something is really broken.
---
Never seen anything since I began playing at the start of the year. Was just wanting a chance at rewards like in any other FO76 event.
---
Who doesn't like Halloween..?!
---
So where should we farm?
---
What about combining that with mutant slaying weapons?
---
This is not the first time we bring this up. Even on the PTS forum.
---
Beth might be looking for it, but they sure as hell ignore it. 
---
They know that the 750% increase in DR at level 20-35 needs fixing, for a long time now.
---
Do you want to destroy Floater grenade?
---
You know the plans to craft it later.
---
I've hit elder every time and received 'none'.
---
It might be an unpopular opinion but I’ve actually found it easier, if you’re not going for god rolls. Like if you’re willing to take a good 2* but.... if you’re after god rolls yeah better have another god roll. Maybe I’m just lucky though. The biggest advice I could give is watch the trading subs for people looking for caps on their decent weapons but not top tier. And if they just say “offers” you can translate that to “I want a bffr 25 fixer”.
---
I have. As I said, multiple characters and accounts.
---
Pistols and Single handed Melee swords/knives
---
Yes.
---
I made a camp with the future tec skin yesterday and mines not grey, but my companion is just standing outside my zone...
---
What about mutant slaying weapons?
---
If your on xbox i can give ya some basic unyielding to get ya started. Lvl. 50 1 stars nothing special odd and ends.
---
All builds have been nerfed, to create intentional “balance issues” that can most easily be solved by increasing the MAX levels on the already established in-game weapons and armor.
---
Get ready to grind out level 70-75 gear and scrip your obsolete level 45-50 God tier gear.
---
I think they're a lot of fun and are surprisingly viable if you can get and hold enough ammo. I like to roll around with like 500+ rounds on my explosives character (which of course requires the Ordinance Express perk to lighten the load).
---
I think the auto launcher is by far the best natural explosive weapon in general (things like the missile launcher and fat man don't do nearly enough damage to warrant the insane weight of their ammo). Also, it works surprisingly well in vats, especially at range. 
---
Beyond that I would run as many ranks of the Demolition Expert perk as possible and I would also recommend running Fireproof or a dense torso mod to protect against self-damage in case you clip a wall or something and end up hitting yourself, which will certainly happen.
---
Way to try gaslighting on the internet there bud
---
Youre a special kind of shitty
---
What Rads? does not affect mutations.
---
I still don't know what is it for.
---
Do you want to destroy Black matter The Fixer?
---
Maybe it's just not as popular an opinion as we would expect. Based on some of the replies in here it would seem plenty of people think the 50+ ammo farms make up for the lack of ammo for new players somehow.
---
I duped 7 years (if you got 3 per day) worth of legendary modules to get the SS armour I'm currently wearing.
---
Something needs to be done about the RNG in this game.
---
I understand we need something to grind for but yeah, good luck getting perfect 3 star armour without buying it from eBay or getting scammed by some kid because we still don't have a safe trade menu.
---
Edit; I duped modules to get my armour because it took 2000 hours of gameplay before I found my first piece of UNY/AP Refresh/Wep Weight armour. The RNG in this game is god awful.
---
Wasn't even able to do that quest today because it didn't give me an area to go to actually get the tubes. I press "show on map" and it just goes to some random area in the mire, no golden circle.
---
Oh fuc-
---
Awesome. Thanks! Can free myself up a couple of perk points.
---
Dunno, I see them constantly now.
---
That's okay I said in my post thats what I'm currently using. Sadly they are random pieces and don't give me much armor
---
More good people are always welcome. I'll find you guys today at some point.
---
Thank you though
---
Good idea :)
---
I had a similar experience today where my gauss shotgun just didn’t do much damage per shot against the boss and I was absolutely spamming it (my shotgun has that one bug where it has an extremely high mag size, like 250 or 300. I don’t know how trust me.). I was going solo so by the time I finished the “kill mobs to spawn boss” stage it was 7 minutes in and it took about 59 seconds to kill it so I clocked in at 7:59. Long story short: a bug saved my ass today.
---

---
Most of the biggest exploits are kept secret, so youd honestly never know that theres dupes and others going on behind the scenes unless you pony up over 500 dollars for a view into the method. Anything beneficial is usually kept hush so RMT can continue for those people.
---
Yep. Current status of the teammates would be really helpful.
---
I mean not just one about daily ops.
---
I did colossal once after the update was a major fail havent bothered since i assume maybe cuz its harder people arent as interested
---
Oh god, I'm going to level up before it finishes showing me the animation of going from level 1 to level 17, so then it's gonna show me going from one to 18 when that finished and by that time I will probably be on 19 so it will show me all of them again
---
It's as common as the Wendigo plusgie/rug. Plus my luck has always been awful. Its carried over from previous games
---
I hope they still plan on rereleasing the old Vault quests as events because that's what Vaults were in older games, and what they should still be in 76. Vaults are a fine location for Ops, but it takes away their identity not to have that kind of experience that the Raids had. They just need to take away the timer and rework the mechanics a bit.
---
I hope they keep working on the other vaults on the map in that vein as well. And if they don't, I'll get a few threads going in the PTS forums.
---
I just had a crappy run....we were doing ok but the two other people bailed as soon as we missed the elder time.... totally lame on their part. I stuck it out with my level 58 gunslinger just out of spite.
---
Robots do seem to be the hardest enemy so far. Been thinking I need to start rolling for some trouble shooters armor
---
Shame... sounds like nocturnal got company if it’s true
---
It should. Most modern minuguns have two buttons, one spins up, press both to fire. Why they wouldn't have this in laser and plasma weapons is a mystery.
---
Lunchboxes?  They give you temporary bonus xp
---
If you want server performance to tank then sure.
---
And yet sometimes when your crosshair is directly over an object, you can't pick it up so you either have to go into first person to do so or move about a bit for the pick up option to show up on the screen
---
If you’re using a sniper then there’s no reason to not be sneaking. The entire point of snipers is staying hidden
---
Might i suggest vanguard armor and the blocking perk under strength fir 45% melee reduction with a vampire weapon to keep ya health topped off and vanguard effect running.
---
But this explains why after a Queen fight a guy with his power fist was fighting me and became hostile for no reason. I'm very tanky however so his plan backfired and he ate a .50 cal lmao.
---
I agree. It's never made sense.
---
Used it with friends. It works with public teams but there is a range.
---
I haven’t seen any problems with mine.  
---
But I have been checking my stash when I log in just to be sure my hoarder items are not trying to be sold.   I also put a skin on the ones I could bc I know those can’t be sold.
---
Thanks. I still got over 100 Ina a storage from previous season...
---
My collectron always tells me to honour the fallen brothers, so why not! +1 for lore friendliness and timeliness.
---
best way to make caps is with your vendor
---
its my end game. i sell all chems and mutations. mags and heads, any gun i dont want to keep but someone else may want
---
my main source of income is chems, mags, heads, and maps ppl come to look to see the guns, but they buy more of the cheaper things 
---
i price all mutations at 420 each to keep ppl from buying me out and selling them to bots 
---
i price all heads at 100 mags at 50, maps forest at 40 all others at 60 
---
chems get listed for half what the game says they are worth 
---
i make around 20-25k on a good day around 10 - 15 k on normal days
---
How do you deploy a camp in NW? Only played the mode twice so still figuring out how it works
---
I usually carry both. A .50 cal is my default and then gauss minigun for bosses and stronger enemies. Really annoying to have to constantly wait that extra second or two before firing. Especially if you just let off the trigger for a split second and still have to wait. Someone needs to teach Beth/Zen how miniguns actually work.
---
It's lots of fun! Especially now with the ammo legendary perks, I'm ecstatic I can use it as much as I please. Really changes how I play the game.
---
I think it was around 200-300 from the event itself, and 10-30 from bodies?
---
Yes. It's like you're brain damaged or something.
---
Yet the Sommerset special was more powerful than any basic gun you'd get elsewhere for quite some time due to the 50% armor penetration. It however did use 44. ammo so couldn't be used as often as one would like. And again none of what you've said has anything to do with the lack of ammo while leveling.
---
On to your second point no one said the game is broken and worse now than ever anywhere in any post or comment in this thread. You decided to use a terrible excuse. Somehow because it was tougher at launch (something bethesda was absolutely shit on for and hemorrhaged players for) that new players don't have any issues that should be rectified. Using the excuse that things need to be balanced after updates doesn't negate the fact that things are unbalanced and should be brought to the attention of bethesda. Telling people to just not say anything is asinine and accomplishes nothing. At best it leaves bethesda in the dark as to the experiences of players and at worst will cause further hemorrhaging of the playerbase, something this game cannot readily afford.
---
Well seeing as how the new content leans towards sneak no longer working we may want stuff to be somewhat kind of acceptable outside of stealth;)
---
Same as adventure mode.
---
Yeah I'd be happy with that im finding it hard to manage my weight with out the weight reduction perks on. I'd like to have the weight reduction perks made into one legendary perk bit like infiltrator perk too. If possible.
---
I think its hilarious when someone asks for a BE flamer and then offers guns nobody wants. These posts make no sense to me.
---
Ty!
---
Not sure if the bug cares about skins. Saw an SS piece of armor in a vending machine and those shouldn’t be able to be sold.
---
Wow.  Yeah, use them to power level.  I've leveled up 25 times in 4 days because of the lunch boxes and the new patch
---
Thanks for the reply Slacker. Took mine down a couple days ago, so was wondering.
---
You dont think they can make there servers better over time?
---
I remember that dupe! I was tempted to dupe nuke colas for the caps...I was so naive lol
---
https://youtu.be/oWPr8CCjuN8 Youtuber i watch who pvps on the norm. Hes also run into a 50 cal that shoots orbital strikes, the guy shooting it actually dcd from all the lag of the strikes going off.
---
if i recall correctly it was stated in the patch notes so its an official change 👍🏼
---
Lol yeah I'm sure everyone has their reasons.
---
I switched from bloodied rifleman to bloodied commando. I had be handmade and fixer modded as semi auto, be lever action and be railway. I tossed the lever action and modded those above to full auto. Lot more fun as auto tbh. Handmade does not even have recoil so it can rip full auto headshots from mile away. From close distance those kill lvl 100 super mutants with one bullet to the head and most mobs is done with few bullets to the chest.
---
Is there a club for this? Sign me up.
---
I'm gonna start taking screenshots of my rewards screens, as proof that I must be cursed in some way.
---
That would be badass ... big brass spyglass tube
---
This happened to me 3 times. The first 2 times after logging back in my whole set of PA vanished. Third time it happened(few months back), all was fine. Makes me hopeful that the problem is finally fixed.
---
Ooh, yeah - that could be it.
---
Yesterday somebody nuked sbq again before we even killed the first queen. Got killed because I didn't think anyone would do that. She was almost dead po a lot of people
---
Daily ops are overtuned hard mode instances that don't give rewards worth getting (and theyre not even hard)
---
The majority of legendary perks dont do anything useful
---
Zone levels dont matter
---
Gear/weapons dont matter as much as they did
---
I understand the need to add content and rebalance things, but at the cost of basically nullifying everything we've been doing for this long? Nah, this patch is bad. Making everything cost more bullets to kill isn't a balance change, its just a lame way to ruin player experience.
---
Why make a game about grinding if when the players do that, the goal post moves and suddenly everything you spent hours collecting means less? How is that fun? 
---
Wastelanders was good
---
Earl was good
---
This is just trash
---
Crazy, I read the patch notes and somehow I missed that.
---
When you first pick up excavator, it sounds like highlighting is how it's supposed to work.  It took me another 100 hours to learn that you actually harvest more
---
I always wait for the group to be full. Someone else pointed out you do not need to be fully bonded, since that will happen before the op is completed.
---
Saw that :/
---
All those level 50 mole rats and radroaches will be lower level again once Bethesda introduces its “ballance fixes” of increasing the MAX level on weapons and armor to level 70-75.
---
Its inevitable.  Get ready to grind out NEW gear ..... working to get the same stuff you already had, but has become obsolete because of leveling imbalances.
---
Yea go with handmade, mod it out and switch out some shotgun perks for rank 3 blocker. And try to get eagle eyes and bird bone and herd mentality ( works in public team even when alone) mutations. With class freak 3 negatives arnt too bad. Bloody mess isn’t as good as it used to be you can put some vats critcal perks in there or richocet. And try the team charisma perks like the strange in numbers. Helps a lot. I have a rifleman build on my alt and it’s not as bad as everyone is saying you just gotta tweak ur perks and what not a lil bit more. And the ops with the resilient robots is hard for anyone alone. Try to team up with ops public team.
---
Edit: that pipe rifles not too bad either. If u can get the right mods for it it can be pretty good.
---
I like daily ops for that reason, I can use all the ammo I want and then get it all back!
---
They fixed the tesla corpses causing massive frame drops and crashes and introduced lag everywhere else. It's been running very poorly since the update. A lot more crashing to desktop too. I'm also seeing the pixelated crap again.
---
Yeah I could see it being very frustrating if you're the kind of gamer that needs to have the best gear. It took me quite a while to just get a full set of unyielding and bolstering SS armor, and I didn't even worry about how many stars.
---
PS4 Pro here. Haven't had this issue unless my PS is really hot. Does it sound like a jet engine?
---
Don't have a plan for sale. But i can mod it for you.
---
GT: Walrus Parkour.
---
Well, **THAT'S GREAT NEWS** .... that's cheap and easy to fix.  No need to drop $500 to $1K on a new GPU, then!  :)
---
Ouch. Hope you have better luck tomorrow.
---
I agree  I've been rockin pistols for a while
---
THANK YOU FOR SAYING IT, IM TIRED OF A SCORCHED HITTING ME WITH A MACHETE AND CARRYING A FUCKING PIPE
---
You can eliminate most aid items to free up carry weight on you and in your stash. I got it and it is a major game changer. I would still recommend keeping some aid items, things that give you good buffs for your build.
---
Take one for the team has a bug that allows pvp to be engaged without you shooting back. Small QOL for that bug is to make sure pacifist mode is on.
---
I have both, I just prefer saving ammo
---
But its for fallout firstfirst which you need fallout first to get the second fallout first.
---
Was on a 3 man group this am and we did like 10 or 12 six minute runs.  Was fun.
---
Man this build is a mess
---
Are you high? In what world is TSE outperforming Bloodied?
---
I never even knew that was a thing
---
They shouldn't be a reward period. Why they decided to add them to the loot pool is just bonkers. At least let us sell the fucking things.
---
Exactly unarmed has the worst range which balances the dmg increase
---
Well shit another season of not making it, I swear they don't design this stuff for people who gave to go places during the day
---
That'd be awesome my GT is mersone206.
---
Until you personally experience it sounds like a beautiful utopistic ideal. Like a hippie commune in the 60's. Then reality hits you like a ton of brick.
---
Agree with you on those points. But I still love using mine. I've collected quite a few now and like to whip them out every now and again
---
Yeahp. It would be awesome to have some ninja ops, deactivating a bomb, stopping a nuke from being launched, etc.
---
If you alt tab during loading screen the resolution gets fucked. Atleast for me :/
---
In A post patch 22 world. Angry turtle did a whole vid on effect post patch. Tse did more damage than BE.
---
&gt; This sub should just change its name to r/downvote
---
You mean the entirety of Reddit.
---
I wish votes would become visible only after they're at -10 or lower, or +10 or higher. This way some individual downvoting troll can't drop the comment to 0 and make it a magnet for more downvotes. I'm not sure if the moderators can make that happen, or whether it should be a Reddit change, but it would help a lot.
---
Another simple change, although one that would have to be made by the Reddit developers themselves, would be to completely remove downvote from Reddit altogether. That would utterly obliterate all downvote trolls forever, and good comments would still raise to the top thanks to upvotes.
---
But, in the flawed system that Reddit is right now, we will have to live with inane downvoting.
---
Oh yess hehe I do like this perk
---
Ahh, that explains why I sometimes find 3 or 4 miniguns when I take out the mutants behind westek!
---
I love this idea, And things like it!
---
You'd still lose your mutation if you went through a decontamination arch.
---
They're halfway there with untradeable gear tbf
---
It could’ve been a “secret”/undocumented change - I don’t think I read it either, but I’ve seen a few posts about it now
---
I'll add you as soon as I get online.
---
I just got water and ammo as well... but that may have just been RNG. If I remember the data mining from before the quest broke correctly, there was never any real reason to turn in more than 4.  Turning in 4 at a time (again, if I remember correctly) would maximize your chances of getting better rewards.  I've always wondered if that was why I stopped getting PA paints after the quest broke.
---
I've given up on common sense where fo76 is concerned \^\^
---
Yesssss :-)
---
What Rifleman Perks am I missing?
---
My junkies plasma caster stands out as most unaffected by the damage changes. Thing is still hitting like a truck.
---
The junkies ffr fixer held up pretty well, too. Bloody ffr handmade... Not so much. 
---
My old reliable, BE 25 lever action, seems hit or miss. In stealth it's doing well, crits are hitting hard, but sometimes it just doesn't do it. Haven't tried my JE or AAE versions yet.
---
Haven't tried my legacies yet. Got a BE Gatling laser and an FE Gatling plasma. Pipboy damage doesn't look too bad.
---
Yes. I'd make sure I got rid of the one in my camp. Never go near one again. Lol.
---
She did a secret service?
---
I normally just let diseases run thier course. None of them are crippling to my build. Which is why I have so many disease cures, and becuase for a long time bethesda would not allow us to sell them to vendors for some reason.
---
And I'm guessing he's the only super mutant to ever where PA. Its a cool idea, but it doesn't make sense.
---
Have you searched for just The Fixer? There is a visual bug affecting names
---
I'm still trying to get that new mining mask I've done colossal problem so many times I'm sick of it and I come on here and people saying "oh I bought it for 4000 caps" but everyone on here asks for the rarest shit for it
---
que?
---
It ruins player vending since its all anyone sells and duping leads to these items we cant sell or trade. Its a part of a larger problem though.
---
Yeah man the point I started duping I was already level 800, I had done everything in the game hundreds of times and still didn't have the armour I wanted.
---
I would definitely give a pistol build a try if you could dual wield...
---
She used a years supply of Psychobuff while being her namesake 😁
---
Wear* I'm dumb
---
No, Doom featured the chainsaw from the beginning and still does though. And bethesda owns the Doom franchise now.
---
Would appreciate any suggestions to make it less messy.
---
I turned off the PA hud because of that reason
---
Sorry, didn't catch that. BTW I too think the game needs in game chat.
---
Yes, did that a lot of times. Already said i tried everything, nothing works..I can appriciate the little bugs, but this is just not done. I cant do a whole quest and challange and there is no way to fix it :(
---
I got 2 out 3 and lights once
---
It’s not a guaranteed reward. Finishing under 8 minutes gives you an 80% chance at a rare reward.
---
Thats part of the problem we cant trade that gear now. I have 3 gauss miniguns that id love to trade but cant.
---
Even better is you don't need to max that legendary perk as that only increases the auto-unlock-level and the lockpick/hacker-rank is always 3 by default.
---
On the topic of liberators, holy fuck level 70 mk5 are something else when they swarm
---
That crash doesn't sound like it's related to the ops at all. Just a crash at a really bad time. What are you asking?
---
yes, I deleted the post because I am not sure what is going on.  It's not high end but I specifically made a point not to list it in my vendor.  I may have  screwed up but I only sold one weapon today.  I got it dirt cheap like 1.3 K and figured I could get 5 K.  IDK It's probably me screwing up but I am not sure.  I have a better fixer in my stash if it was someone up to know good so it's weird.
---
This sucked, great time though on the run.
---
Yeah happened to me also. Was all the way to final boss too.
---
That's rough, I've personally had smooth sailing and a lot of fun with daily Ops. I play it on 2 characters per day for double the rewards. I haven't gotten the rewards I wanted yet, but that's not a big deal. It hasn't even been a week haha.
---
I don’t understand why they don’t just let us level up our gear in the craft menu
---
OMG.😱 what's next? Challie?😁😁
---
Wow really?  Those deff can’t be sold
---
I think I've gotten 3 rewards and I get elder tier at least once out of the three tries a day(or at least from what I gather we have three chances). It's the luck of the draw, but I absolutely love Daily Ops now. The first Daily Ops I despised, but now that I know what I'm doing its a piece of cake.
---
Not familiar with the codebase, but would speculate that counting ammo consumption would be the most trivial part of the coding
---
I just check my stash when I go to my camp just to be sure.
---
Absolutely
---
Luckily there are shotgun perks in the strength category, so the points you put into strength at the start won't be wasted.
---
So the real question is do I now apply the paint so that it can’t be accidentally sold but then risk losing it from being accidentally dropped , decisions , decisions ...
---
I hope Bethesda fixes this before i get it i mean it is supposed to look like an environmental gas mask type of suit it should be connected imagine if the stealth suit wasn't connected
---
So I had around 4 K caps, sold a weapon so now around 8 K caps, confirmed with the buyer so it's missing
---
Yeah sorry I didn’t read your post correctly. You probably can’t fix it without removing your camp. I had something a lot worse I’m my camp when I accidentally moved something underground and couldn’t remove it. The only way I could fix it was removing my camp.
---
A public teams jumper spotted
---
Because they are a lot harder now imo
---
Have you ever played Warframe ;)  
---
There's a class called Hydroid who is very much a pirate and you can dual wield a numerous amount of pistols and daggers (on any class).

Feels funny reading the post and comments about trading, I've been playing off and on since the beta and I've never done trading with players before other than going to player vending machines looking for scout armor parts but I never actually traded with another person before on fo76. I'm never looking for the best of something, but when I'm comfortable with something I'm pretty happy with it.
---
&gt; TBH I think I’m actually taking less damage somehow
---
I've been thinking the same thing.  This morning, for example, I was running Encryptid and holding two pylons.  My damage needle in my PA was barely dropping at all.
---
Her Mom gave her the XP.
---
Now, this is the biggest tragedy of the update...that they corrected the grammar on that note.
---
&gt;The RNG in this game is god awful.
---
I don't play the market in this game, so I'm a bit biased, but if it weren't for dupers we would have far, far less good, let alone god-rolled, weapons and armors in the game.
---
Back in the day, that is actually what happened.
---
Omg I wish! Before 76 came out, Brahmin were my favorite! Opossums win as my favorite by just a little though! It would be much harder to get a whole cow taxidermy though!
---
this is what i do, when i remember.
---
daily ops has you standing still for a bit. perfect time to chuck useless things at incoming attackers.
---
Really? I’ve been finding the challenges easier. Maybe I’ve just got a good routine down after S1.
---
Oh good, I hadn’t heard this.
---
What's the best way to efficiently use lunch boxes? How long does the XP boost last?
---
THIS!  YES!
---
I've noticed it too, same happened when Wastelanders came out. I think this might be a future pattern when new content cames out.
---
Says the one who has now edited their original comment to seem less shitty. And gone and told people to circle jerk.
---
Enjoy your sad little life pal
---
Speaking of Ricochet, is it actually worth using for a power armor build? 
---
I know its off topic but I have a few extra perk points I'm not sure where to spend and some extra survivability from Ricochet might be nice.
---
That's a better chance than getting red asylum or deep mining helmet
---
Not free. Foundation and Crater are free.
---
Uplink is a really lame mode.
---
Scientific reasons.
---
crap ....5/5 day elder
---
1/5 bonus reward
---
and before one of the terminally stupid mentions legendaries ..... i get more killin scorch beast doing the repeatable xp for the score run
---
Yep that level 50 perk super duper is super helpful for players under level 50 like the OP said. Even ammosmith is level 32 so does absolutely nothing for a 20-30 player.
---
Edit to add: I'm just pointing out there is a early/mid-range leveling gap that has been pointed out by plenty of players(including the OP and Bethesda in another thread). Most replies when people mention ANY ammo problems is super duper, ammosmith and lego ammo perk...none of which are available for low/mid-range players.
---
Exactly, everyone is quick to hate on dupers but those same people are happy to use duped gear.
---
If you have a legacy weapon or even a b2525 fixer it was definitely duped at some point.
---
I am sure a taxidermist can fix that for you 😀
---
Yes, ammo crafting should get reworked. A reduction in mats per the increased usage of ammo with OWL, would benefit a lot of players. Counter point, ammo is not meant to be super plentiful in the wasteland. A decrease in mats cost per set created could run into a weight issue for later levels. The DR and level of mobs in the OWL update has brought a slight change to what our character builds get purposed for.
---
I’m on pc too. I’ve felt the game is actually more stable for me. I never had many hard crashes, but the fast travel bug hasn’t been affecting me nearly as much lately.
---
i'm starting to like it except for the annoying challenges.
---
I kinda feel like an NPC doing my own thing. 
---
I go into the fire to get around things, loot everything for no reason, shoot at people if they go near my stuff. 
---
Must make it crazy for the people who are actually competitive.
---
TIP: remember to select don't fill out team.
---
The original card....sorry I had to 😂
---
You got me there. I’m just happy with it now and mass producing as much ammo as I can.
---
I wish this would happen
---
I actually decided to spend no perk points on lock picking or hacking just to see how far I could go in the game without it. Originally I tried swapping in and out perk cards when I needed it, but that quickly became a chore. For this build I went hackless. Maybe this LP would cover that gap. I assume people don't swap this LP out frequently.
---
Legendary infiltrator is pretty bad. 
---
You could easily get a +5perception or +5int then move 2 points to the others and be able to equip 5/6 needed cards to reach all locks. 
---
But you would also get the added benefit of being able to use those specials for others things in the future. Not to mention the passive benefits one could get for the specials themselves.
---
Legendary infiltrator is a luxury and QoL card but you genuinely give up a lot of versatile options that you could get otherwise.
---
Useful info, thank you for putting this together.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older 🎶
---
🎶Then we wouldn't have to wait so long? 🎶
---
🎶And wouldn't it be nice to live together 🎶
---
🎶In the kind of world where we belong?🎶
---
I ran around for the last 20 months with all three lockpick perks constantly equipped. This infiltrator card was kind of a god send for my ocd, I was able to free up perks and still pick every lock I come across.
---
Had my first crash today in a LONG time.
---
Once you’ve unlocked it via the plan it’ll have a chance to drop from any activity that could award legendaries, Pretty much treat it like the fixer
---
Thank you so much!
---
Very nice. There are definitely some outliers in terms of risk/reward here. Give me deathclaws all day...
---
Are you kidding me? This is a dumb change. Level 60+ dogs and mole rats breaking my camp every 10 seconds. I have stopped repairing it, I just build whatever workbench again. Walking anywhere cost you 1000 bullets, I've stopped shooting and take the death when not on missions...
---
So maybe change from 
---
"Sneak attacks with melee weapons do 3x normal damage"
---
to
---
"Sneak attacks with melee weapons add 3x weapon base damage"?
---
Just be careful when around player owned locks, you may unintentionally open a locked door or box and earn yourself a bounty.
---
I would move 2 points from P to A and get Adrenaline level 2. And drop skeetshooter.
---
There are a lot of huge, marine looking skeletons that are 100% out of place in West Virginia and as much as I'd like to think they have some kind of hidden meaning I'm pretty sure it's just a lazy use of old FO4 assets.
---
Yeah but you can get 5 free slots from a legendary card, which would give you more options in the future, and all the passive buffs that the special can give. So master infiltrator at max level is only really saving you 1 possible slot not 6. 
---
Because it's not how good is master infiltrator compared to normal cards, it's how good is it compared to other legendary cards.
---
The one thing you have to remember is this: It's fallout. We KNOW it is going to have bugs. Take FO3,FONV,FO4. THEY ALL HAD BUGS. Did you barely play them? TCHH, I threw away most of my life playing the heck out of those. The storyline sucked me in, and, like my neighbor that must be on bath salts, I couldn't drop the addiction. I'm not white knighting for anyone other than the spirit of the game itself. Can you honestly tell me," I wish those games never existed"? Not gonna be able to reply back for a bit, have 5 reddit pages to upvote.
---
I’ll be honest, if I saw a Legendary PITA, I wouldnt hesitate to try.
---
Awesome thank you. At base it's not very good so it's good to hear that it can also be legendary.
---
I’m picky with my shots lol sometimes it takes me a few minutes to get it set
---
It's pretty much the same. Bloodied Stealth Commando still slaps
---
It didn't get lost. Just comprised.
---
Of course.  
---
I'm referring to the ones that 100% roleplay including on mic.
---
Don’t forget this has been an issue with isotope mutation for a while now as well. If someone punches you and can get it to proc, you’ll engage pvp.
---
Comment of the day. 🍆
---
The Enclave is disappointed in you... member
---
Good to know. The basic version is pretty awesome on its own.
---
Wish we had a purveyor sale now.
---
I think that 500 is not too much to ask, and balances out nicely.
---
Picking Thru-hiker in Agility or Traveling Pharmacy in Strength are good options for inventory management. Don't worry too much about pack rat, as you should store all of your junk in your stash after breaking it down.
---
Finding some favorite perks to use in Charisma is a good option, as 3 points in Charisma let's you share a card. Every 3 points after that let's you share a stronger rank of a card (6 points for a rank 2 card, 9 points for rank 3).
---
Gunsmith is potentially your best friend early on so that your guns break down slower. Makeshift warrior is the melee equivalent.
---
Scrounger and Pharma Farma in the luck category can be taken early on if you want to start getting a good stockpile of ammo and chems, respectively. Combining Pharma Farma with First Aid over in Intelligence can have you swimming in Stimpaks before long.
---
Not build related, but something to keep in mind is that you will learn mods for weapons and armor as you break things down. For instance, learning to make a new barrel for your shotgun by scrapping similar shotguns. So be sure to pick up pretty much everything at the start, and break it down at a crafting table. You will get materials, and learn plenty of mods to get you started.
---
When you are in your pip-boy inventory, you can go to the junk category and press RB. This should bring up a list of your individual junk components. Scroll through the list and press A to highlight key junk items, like screws and lead. This makes it so a magnifying glass will appear when you look at items in the world that have this item in it, so you know to pick it up.
---
Lastly, try not to repair too much of your stuff at the beginning. You should be finding plenty of weapons or armor from enemies, so try to just find a new piece of gear when yours is close to breaking, instead of repairing it. You will be happy when you need to actually repair stuff later and you have stockpiled a good amount of junk, especially screws.
---
My GT is irion15, if you see me on, feel free to toss me a team invite. Super friendly and super chill.
---
Edit: spacing.
---
Still gg on getting the plan dude! I’ve been trying across three characters since the update went live to get it 😂
---
Legendary Perks were definitely the right thing to make the game even better.
---
It may just be me, but I’ve found 99% of the time just mashing A (xbox) fixes it
---
I'm not your kemosabe, vriend
---
What platform? I know on ps4 it wasn't in subscriptions. 
---
I'd need to be on my ps4 to remind me just where but I'm not home right now.
---
Buying serums from players, that way you can choose the mutations you want.
---
TIL there are people who play Berserker. I learned something!
---
While we're here, are there any Nocturnal build-users here? How does that play?
---
Buy from player vendors. That way you can get the mutations you want and not random ones.
---
I was surprised tbh lol. I traded for most of the other plans and the spec ops stuff so I am pretty set.
---
Well that math is totally wrong then. And i'm not gonna scrap all my card beside 56 to prove it right.
---
That sounds nice to me
---
Console or pc? 
---
On pc its just h. Either way you gotta back off for the animation.
---
When you say it doesn't work when facing an enemy what exactly do you mean.
---
I enjoy doing them but I've gotten Elder every day since they were added and gotten only a single rare reward. Anyone who believes it's actually an 80% chance must also believe that the Purveyor gives out Fixers and missile launchers equally, too.
---
1 hour.  They stack up to x4.  If you're high level kill all the super mutants in front of west tek, log out, (to main menu) log back in.  They should respawn.  Just keep doing that.  I've gained almost 30 levels in the past 5 days just doing that.
---
On console it’s right on D-pad.
---
Yeah lol I see a lot of blood eagles using plasma weapons when they die it’s a pipe pistol or shotgun
---
bethesda was aiming to streamline gameplay (so they said) and felt penalizing players for not keeping up with their hunger and thirst was not the best idea in hindsight.  so they said they were going to remove all the negative effects for not eating food and drink, but keep the positive buffs.
---
basically they wanted to keep the carrot on the stick but remove the whip if we didn't go for the carrot enough.
---
I got two legacies for my spec ops pieces so this daily ops has already became my favourite event 😂
---
Oops. I was thinking caps pool.
---
No. Not only different factions have different items but different vendors in that faction have different things for sale.
---
if you're on xbone i can hook you up for 250 each. 
---
look into which ones you need and which ones you don't. And if you didn't know you can use rad-x diluted to protect from rads without suppressing your mutations.
---
don't like
---
THANK YOU!!!!
---
It still allows beth to have players that loiter in the game, and allows players to unload more legs at a faster rate.
---
There are two ways to get serum:
---
1. From player vendors (300-500 caps is a fair price, I've seen 200 but 500 is max don't get desperate just server hop)
---
2. From the &gt;!Whitespring science divison bunker!&lt; (I'm hiding the answer because the option is available only later in the game)
---
I think that's bs. I've been getting elder every time on the first try and I get nothing rare more than 50% of the time.
---
 would be pissed. no mob has ever used a fixer to shoot at me
---
I think it’s just RnGesus pranking you dude, just an hour ago I rolled 4 weapons and three came nocturnal and one came stalkers so I feel your pain.
---
Autostim armor would do it.
---
I use the camera method. The camera will help you find dead bodies.
---
Everyone keeps complaining about molerats but ffs tick’s troll me far harder
---
Like maybe not doing it
---
I've seen from other users that rifles are also great right now, and there's one perk card called rifleman that I think boosts them. I would think that only one or two weapons cards would be okay for QOL players (I actually run Bear Arms for the weight, which is how I run so many gatling guns.)
---
Regardless of your playstyle, I think the game should still be fun for everyone. Whether that means QOL players or "build" players.
---
thats cool i got a shelf plan
---
Save up your points from the legendary runs and buy the item when it comes back to shop. Problem solved.
---
I think it was bugged honestly. She told me I was “almost as nice as Gail”, then proceeded to say I wasnt very nice to her. Same thing happened to me on my other character who sided with foundation, when &gt;!Jen mentioned having to bury her mom after I rescued her, and the secret service agents mentioned me killing the ghoul guy even though I didnt!&lt;. even Beckett said &gt;!something about his brother being dead acter we saved him!&lt;. Its a preeetty damn annoying bug if you ask me.
---
meat bags in super mutant camps should have some
---
I was thinking that how did a whale skeleton get on top of the Space Station wreck. If if is a whale.
---
I believe Duping has pros and cons. It does ruin the economy, which is the biggest downfall, but there will be more weapons out there that people want, so there isn’t as high of a demand, so it’ll be easier to get.
---
PS: I do not condone Duping, but I believe it has its pros and cons.
---
For people who do dupe, it ruins the game for them. You have everything at your disposal, so what’s your goal after that?
---
I got a quad plasma out of a scrip machine before parch 22 the character hasn’t done the questline yet and it was on a private server!
---
Go figure
---
Ok sounds good, is that an aid item to look for? Also is there anyway to get them directly, like how did those players get them.
---
Heavy weapons, heavy combat armor and unyielding. Although Unyielding is the lower your health, the higher your damage? I would need something for high health. Thanks for your advice :)
---
No you're actually lucky: you're getting rare rewards. I usually get none.
---
*people who have been saving BE and AAE pistols their entire lifes*: *ITS TIME*
---
Ah, bloodied is low health. I’m a high health character. What would be good for a high health? I appreciate the advice! :)
---
No. Ranked up LPs stay ranked up. It does cost 1 perk coin to remove them, however.
---
why would you turn pacifist off?
---
I've been seeing a lot of nukes drop for both earle and sbq. I don't know if this update made it to where if you nuke earle first, complete the event, and launch another nuke but for sbq, it toggles another colossal event. But lately I have been noticing Earle getting glitch into the walls or falling through the ground and stuff, making him disappear.
---
With mutants yes, although I'll take their arms of they've got an annoying weapon. Never seen one drop them, but they've swapped before when doing that so I assume it's the same idea.
---
The robots today though... I've got robot killer stuff and I'm doing 35 damage against a fucking Protection. Might've been a bad load though because people kept joining the Op, getting wiped out the same as was happening to me, then just leaving. Took 26 minutes and seven separate joins (8 extra players in the end, six of which left in less than a minute) to eventually crawl through it.
---
****bows****
---
the not mucked up by time name for it is "Inverse Kinematics"
---
honestly very little of it has to do with my brain lol.  i used to dabble in 3d modeling.  this was right at the time that the tech was breaking into the home market.  was all the rage on the scene, but i stuck with the oldschool.  sure it took about the same time to pose everything vs letting the render engine do the work...
---
but the tradeoff was that while i could stop posing and do something else if needed, if i relied on inverse kinematics, that was going to be a stretch of time my computer was unusable.
---
Didn't edit anything 
---
Stop being such a turd lol
---
You literally just can't deal with the fact that you're wrong
---
Yeah you wanna go through my 5 characters and see how almost all of them have limb damage I made the same post a month ago. It’s annoyong
---
What about dual sawn offs?
---
I also been noticing that if I'm in third person, I cant place my power armor anywhere.
---
If you like picking off baddies at range, you want Follow Through.   (I like doing the same.)   Beyond that, I chose Ammo Factory for my alt, and then these for my main:   SPECIAL perception, agility and luck; the ones that give fire and poison resistance in Sizzling Style and Funky Duds).  I have a build and gear that can rock between bloodied and not, between heavy weapons and commando.   Only does PA during the hardest events.
---
You can change your mind later by spending one perk coin on something you want to swap out, but you wouldn't want to do this for something on which you'd invested perk coins.   They are just too hard to earn (3.6 per level and it takes 300 to fully level up a card).   Later, after you hit Level 700 or something, it might not be a big deal, but until then..... if you're not sure about a Legendary Perk Card, don't upgrade it you know you want it.
---
It is an aid item. To make them yourself just isn’t worth it, first you have to learn the recipe for each one, the recipes are around 18k each alone (there are 19 of them in total) and then you have to gather the materials to craft them.
---
I like it, it’s a nice change. 👍
---
Space whales?
---
Well, the good news is limb damage seems to be working properly again ingame. It's both odd and funny to see enemies develop a bad leg from being set on fire.
---
No, unyielding is higher stats, lower your health. I run unyielding even on full hp characters, since unless you got God mode on, you will occasionally be at lower hp or be hit with rads.
---
Vanguard DR, or any DR really, doesnt make much difference. I really don't notice too much difference between taking damage with my 100 DR lv 50, and my 370 DR lv 270. A perk like blocker or dodgy will do far more.
---
Sneak has been nerfed so I'd stay away from chameleon unless you're looking for every sneak boost.
---
The alternative is taking type resistances. Get pieces of things that hurt you the most, whether it's troubleshooters, mutant slayers etc
---
On my heavy, i wear power armour. Underneath that is a Chinese stealth suit so i don't have to be naked outside my PA.
---
If you want every mutation just lose starches genes, but if there are some you dont want then I'd keep it
---
I haven't been on much since the patch dropped, but out of a three hour play session last night, I got dumped three times on PS4.  This is up from almost zero over the last six months.
---
On console use right on the D-pad during combat to stim. You can't be in VATS though
---
You missed "repeatedly until several hit at once".
---
Ah, this makes sense.😂😂👽
---
Now I know I'm not the biggest disappointment in the world.
---
Tank killer effects pistol builds now, I’d say that’s a decent new thing.
---
I think this would be awesome. In my opinion the only reason they havent done this is because I think it would encourage people to server hop or camp for mob spawns to get ammo or easier scraps. For example, I know a ton of super mutants spawn at grafton steel, so id imagine a ton of people who need .308 or .38 ammo would be farming the hell out of areas like that!
---
Better yet east of there is the cat lady hunter house go there and get all the cat dishes and then run around wsprings golf course picking us golf balls= 1 cork n 1 plastic each
---
Yes but the same player contesting every single one you take is not just normal PvP but targeting  you, aka griefing.
---
I agree. I spent a lot of time getting absolutely perfect gold bullion gear gear. My weapons aren't that great but any heavy gun gets the job done at the cost of truckload of bullets. The new changes barely felt much different for me and I'm still mowing down mobs like a murder hobo.
---
I remember it was difficult as a new player getting into the game since all my gear was trash. I  can't imagine the scene now when enemies are significantly stronger, and player damage is reduced.
---
I'll would gladly trade you a Brotherhood Spec Ops outfit for the Glaive plan... IF IT WAS TRADABLE! Bethesda must had did a last minute change for the Glaive, I swear they were tradable in the pts.
---
Sigh....that would be amazing. Unfortunately Gauss pistol still suffers from its vats unreliability. It still hits like a truck after the patch but automatic weapons with large magazines are the most reliable and consistent choices in this game unfortunately.
---
Lock on VATS, leave and lock again. Pain in the ass, but works very well for me...rarely miss now. Know what you're talking about as I experienced this regularly.
---
It's second nature now and easy.
---
Rifles and pistols are still playable, maybe theyre not quite as good as heavy guns and commandos but theyre definitely usable. As for the legendary effects I agree most are bad but  imo its intentional to keep you playing.
---
Yeah, not sure why I'm being downvoted when it was what happened.
---
It is, around 2 years of the same music gets tiresome. Plus it makes it feel like the world is changing 😊
---
That's why I keep getting rad worms... hopefully it works for you though!
---
See I don't think it is. Play any other pvp game like COD or Battlefield etc etc it's not griefing if you come across the same player in a match. All workshops are Public pvp zones and contesting them fairly is not griefing. 
---
Sure the attacker is making a choice but so is the claimer to keep going for workshops they cannot defend. Works both ways
---
Addition: In workshop pvp BOTH parties agree to fight when you first claim and first contest. You can't grief someone who has agreed to take part.
---
As does pa heavy weapon
---
I threw one yesterday and saw a blood eagle go flying lol
---
I'm pretty sure the multiple cards were actually to enforce level restrictions.
---
For example, you could get gladiator at level 2 and max it out giving a +20% damage, but that's all you get until level 20 when you could pick up the Expert Gladiator perk... etc.
---
With a single card, as proposed, you could max out your weapon damage straight out the gate. I'm not necessarily saying that this is a bad thing, for the record.  Just trying to explain the underlying intent.
---
It's the same reason that lock picking and hacking are 3 separate cards instead of 1 card each with multiple ranks.  They don't want a level 5 player with max lockpick.
---
In the grand scheme of things most the armor effects aside from unyielding are utter bollocks. I noticed on the updated community calendar new armor is on the way and hopefully that means new effects. All my full hp just use a random assortment usually based on secondary and tertiary effects unless there are situational requirements like troubleshooters etc.
---
Three ticks killed me over at the Gorge Junkyard - and I’m at level 121.
---
if you dont have speed demon, could be.  or if they have overdrive servos on their legs, which increase sprint speed, that could be too.
---
Ok, sounds good
---
Yeah, i start running again away when i see a deathclaw 🤣 this update is awesome 🤣
---
If you are high health and not using stealth, you really should switch to power armor. There is very little incentive not to.
---
If you're in regular armor, vanguards is good for protection but a mixed set of enemy specific gear (zealots, hunters, etc.) is a little better, just really hard to find because everyone scrips it.
---
SS armor is the best normal armor but it's a long grind. Heavy BOS combat armor is next, or actually I think a heavy BOS chest, metal arms and leather legs is the most well rounded or something like that.
---
If you get a limb damage double barrel, try it in vats 🤐😁
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a hush hush one because the other day there were 3 simultaneous nukes, whitesprings, Earle and queen at the same time. Created a lot of server lag.
---
I might try switching my handmade to a prime receiver to see if there's a difference between hardened, there wasn't before and I liked rolling cheap 5.56 rounds with it
---
You know I tried answering your post without telling you to transition to bloodied. But i think you need to transition to bloodied. In my experience playing Fallout 76, damages overrules everything.
---
I disabled my damage perks and was still able to one shot ghouls in Lewisburg without sneak attacks/crits, not sure what all the fuss is about.
---
Never had that problem lol.
---
I like that idea like in fallout 4 I made some much junk that way
---
Furious seems pretty good these days
---
Personally I haven't had too much issues with Patch 22. PA full health build. AA shotguns with good VATS stars work nicely. With occasional use of heavy weapons such as miniguns and cryos to deal with bullet sponges like SBQ and Mirelurk Queens. Vampire handmade are probably worth a look too.
---
Damn that stupid lucky, congratulations getting that bundle 😺
---
If on ps4 i can craft most of them for you for 250 each
---
Not being facetious at all.  You can play the game any way that you want.  The people who want to not optimize their perks with their goals or gear are going to struggle a bit.  It is not impossible to be able to play the game without min/max or using the same build as everyone else.  Now if understanding the perks and how they work together and with which gear is considered hardcore, then I guess the game is not entirely casual.  My point is the game should be fun for you to play in the way that you want to play.  If you want to one shot everything and be OP,  you can not be casual.  If you want to be casual, you should still understand the mechanics and set yourself up to meet your goals.  People can still play, even with One Wasteland, super casually.  They just need to understand that they will progress a little slower than average.  I think part of the problem is that a lot of people think the guys with magic guns, or the perfectly optimized bloodied builds are 'average' players.  
---
also FTFY  
---
Not struggle a bit
---
You are being facetious
---
This Haiku fails not
---
Share them opening it while on a team!
---
This is the only thing I'm missing. I can do it in under the second ranked time by myself but it seems like hitting the best time possible is impossible without other people.
---
Did you ever find the answer?
---
Yes, YES! I’ve been saying this for ages. Switched from a pistol build to a shottie partly cause of this.
---
I’ve had this happen when I haven’t claimed anything yet. Seems like as soon as it registers a new score boost it goes all the way back to the first item and goes through each one until it catches up with your current rank. And it keeps doing that until you claim at least the very first item on the board.
---
It really depends on what you mean by top tier. Do you want to be an unkillable tank?  Go pa heavy weapons.  Do you want to sniper from afar?  Than go, well, sniper.
---
I have this. It seems to level up until it reaches the level you actually are at.
---
I notice when I'm sniping things this happens a lot. The only solution that I've found is to get closer to the target and try again until it works. At least it doesn't break stealth.
---
Are you on xbox? I recently put up my old Halloween plans for 1.5k each haha
---
I'm getting a little salty about it's drop chances in general. I seem to be getting everything but the Glaive plan.
---
When I made my first character I did a lot of events at low level because I wanted to get as many plans as possible as well as the fusion generator so I’ll probably do that again now with my first build I was shotgun so I’ll be doing sniper just to have a different character than my original one
---
Also can't be used in power armor.
---
Well, the high level/frequent players have everything they want from colossal, and I guess people don’t see the worth in nuking the Queen for legendaries since the ops give more?
---
That leaves nuking for flux, which means that other the queen or some of the spots around that map that give large amounts.
---
Find a quad double barrel shotgun, or an anti-armor or junkies fire rate combat shotgun.
---
Great job 👍
---
Use the search bar next time, been answered multiple times every single day. Anyways it’s only an 80% chance to get a rare if you get elder. Once you’ve completed it, that’s it for the day until reset
---
Lol still that's to long of a wait
---
Should be 9 am pacific time
---
I like the perk card ideas but I disagree with unarmed. Bloody unarmed has lost so much damage now that being bloodied isn’t worth it, you can’t do much in boss fights and are mostly a stimpack disposal system. The nerf went too far in that regard.
---
i use no chems, eat spoiled veggies, and drink boiled water lol.  med wise i carry (and chew through like they're candy) super stims and 5 radx and 5 rad away in case of emergency.
---
i couldn't eliminate the stims since you don't get enough often enough of the shortcut meds.  i'd have to take enough time off at my camp to fill the stockpile before i'd feel safe, and would take too long to replenish.
---
gonna hold out for a bit to see what they actually end up cooking up.  only really have thruhiker i'd free up and good with salt i mostly keep to make sure my vendor trash doesn't spoil between dumps.
---
In lights, with the modern fireplace and winter fireplace
---
Sadly I’m on PC, but thanks
---
You make a great point. I didn’t even consider that.
---
Yes but fallout 76 is primarily a pve game not a PvP game and coming across the same player more than once in a workshop isn't griefing, but if the same player turns up to kill you every time you try to take a workshop, so you change servers and the same guy follows you and does the same it's griefing. Continually targeting the same player is griefing.

You could just spam throw them.

For plastic I kill the ghouls in whitesprings golf club. The ghouls can drop junk that is made of plastic and outside the front door and room on the left there are things like baby rattles that give 2 plastic and cue balls give 2 plastic and there are 2 pool tables in that left room. Same with all the trash cans in the place, 1 outside and 2 or 3 downstairs
---
The station, which is 4 caps away and you'll get a lot more from the ghouls, has tables outside in that parking lot with plastic bowls and cutlery. Lots of plastic to loot. I needed plastic and tagged it fir search and now I have hundreds
---
Oh yeah I had to heal all my mutations away and redo them to get rid of it.
---
Yeah that’s all the camps with the future tech skin
---
Jet existed pre-War. The only reason anyone think it’s a post-War drug is because Myron from FO2 lies about that to make himself look more important. 
---
If your Intelligence is high enough (I think 9 or 10), you can access a Speech check where The Chosen One can call him out on it and he sputters and tries to dismiss it. 
---
There is also a female character in the game that states she was thrown out of Vault City for being a Jet addict. And that occurred before Myron was even born. 
---
In short, the only source we have that says Jet is a post-War creation is a teenage pervert druggie that needed to make sure the Mordino Family thought he was useful and valuable.
---
As far as if it was present in Appalachia?  Possibly. But no one has found any yet.
---
Been there, done that. 
---
Took me awhile to figure what hell i did to earn my bounty.
---
Also, by joining an Ops team you are signaling to the server that you are looking to do Ops and would like people to join you. In theory, anyways.
---
Would I have to redeploy my camp in Adventure mode or NW camp is separate?
---
I know you can get at least 2 as i got liquid courage and gutter plans on my alt. 
---
You only get 3 chances if you get elder basically. 2 really low chances and 1 low chance.

For good weapons I'd just go kill a behemoth.
---
The first 2 times I did it solo and didn’t really get it/got so mad because I was just CONSTANTLY dying and didn’t feel like I stood a chance.
---
Then I joined an events team for the last two times and really enjoyed it, it was a breeze and we finished under 6 minutes both times. It’s really fun when you work together with your team
---
It’s unfortunate that you are not receiving the free Atoms to which you believe you are entitled.
---
Technically 83.8 I believe
---
Or use a PA, or that agi perk that autostims
---
I love that someone downvoted you like you need some doctorate in min-maxing to realize grabbing the perks that say they make you do more damage makes you do more damage.
---
Ach. I tried again today, looks like it's true, one time only.
---
That would probably create situations like unidan, or brigades of upvotes bots to increase views of misinformation.
---
Yeah, it was/is a bug that allowed you to reload qt the max possible speed.
---
Ok too bad. They are not hard to come by so you could just ask in the marketplace and if you are ready to pay 500 each, someone will probably hook you up. Other wise just check player vendors👍
---
I think it would be better to sit down and think about what you want from your build before you decide if you want to try it. It's a costly thing to jump into unless you get lucky. 
---
My bloodied wasn't affected by much overall but it's the only build I had proper armor for
---
They really need to add in the Anti-Material rifle to give something back to folk who love their hunting rifles.
---
I have a Furious two-shot and it was a great weapon for around the Forest and Ash Heap. Knew the levelled enemies would compromise it.
---
That would be cool. Also something for the blood eagles. They make the crater raiders look soft.
---
I hope your right and casual players can still find the game fun. Low player numbers would be bad for the future support of the game.
---
I hate those little commie basturdz!
---
Could be an Easter Egg referring to “The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy”, where the whale suddenly finds itself in space!
---
Look for the broken bowl of petunias nearby.
---
Oh I think it could be done but it would be a costly endeavor, money and staff, and it would take a very long time to accomplish. 
---
And it's something most companies would not attempt for that reason.  Their mindsight is if it works well enough now work within those parameters. 
---
Why else do you think they are developing shelters, our own private instances rather than increase budget out in the world?  Because it is way easier to accomplish and allows them to focus other resources to other types of content.
---
The next gen consoles are supposed to be backward compatible. I would take this to mean, if  you have the game for the current gen, it should work on next gen; assuming they allow you to take your digital libraries with you (not sure about disks)
---
Does the handmade have a suppressor option as well?    Haven’t been able to find one.
---
I had it level me up from 0-7 the other night, though one it got through all the visual stuff, I was at the proper level. I’d already claimed my prizes, so when it got to the level ups, it was just an empty cell showing up on the screen. I think it happened right after I opened a private server.
---
Hey same and I’m like level 80. I’m sure they will do another update and make some adjustments.
---
To beef with griefers who keep attacking me and my friends 😤
---
It really does.
---
Some ppl say they get by without bloodied/junkies but they leave out alot of details as well.
---
Like being level 450 with 6 legendary perks slotted to make up the difference.
---
Or they use magic weapons
---
Or they exploited the ammo factory and have 800k 5.56 ammo so theyll never notice the extra ammo consumption.
---
If you aren't going to go full bloodied, go two shot
---
Really? Drives me mad lol.
---
The One Wasteland is going to be pretty nasty on weak builds.  People often have find out what works for them and don’t get a good build working for them until level 60 or 70.  While you are still working things out, you could try things out in lower level areas.
---
You might want to share your perk layout and equipment.  Then people might be able to provide you advice on how to move forward with your character.
---
No, NW is it's own thing. Dropping the CAMP in a match has zero effect on anything in regular gameplay mode
---
They might ... but I would bet that it would go along with grinding out 4000 gold bullion to earn the perk card that allows you to do it.
---
Its about keeping the players playing and exposing them to atom shop purchases, or continued subscriptions.
---
I assume it’s a name for a group of drugs made using the same or similar ingredients. Myron claims that he created and formed the recipe using Brahmin dung. But using speech you can get a dialogue option that implies that he come across a recipe somewhere most likely in a lab. The prewar recipe most likely used cow dung instead which would of been less potent. I would assume it shouldn’t be in 76 unless it is a prewar version instead of the standard one as Myron wasn’t even born yet for it to in or around Appalachia.
---
So depending on what has been done or writers not having a clue and assuming her was prewar like they must of done in 4 by having in a vault in a storage container that was locked before the bombs dropped.
---
Each level has a chance of rare plans,lowest level is 5%, middle level is 10%, highest is 80%. So if you knock out a daily op in under 8 mins, you will have, in theory, 3 chances to get plans, but the chances don't stack. Have personally been awarded Super Reactor And Symptomatic plans on a single run.
---
Only if you can toggle it on/off because I want nothing to do with it.
---
stick with it. you have access to level 45 max gear now. and once you hit 50 you can equip everything. so you'll have better weapons and armour. You can also start perfecting your build as every level up after 50 you can pick a card or move a point. And there's also mutations which will make things easier.
---
Aren't both magic weapons so it doesn't matter?
---
Share you're loadout, maybe we can optimize a bit.
---
I've been investigating a bit, I've found a video of the developers explaining what they have achieved in 2020, seems like they are close to release.
---
There's also a livestream for a month ago but I haven't watched it yet
---
https://youtu.be/-rFuZbekkeU
---
Miami seems irresistible so far. Hype is real!
---
you think i'm going to read that word salad, lmao
---
Full health characters should stick with heavies and PA. Finding a good heavy weapon legendary with explosive trait should be your main priority. I find that 300 DR 300 ER is sufficient as far as armor goes, and any legendary effects on top of it is not necessary, autostim should do great with heavy guns so you don't have to stop spinning that minigun to stim up during fights.
---
Yeah, like ESO has it. It would be in settings.
---
To be honest locking a feature as good as duel-wielding behind Legendary perks would'nt go over very well. Make it a passive for when you have at least one maxed out pistol damage perk card.
---
Whale fossils can be found inland... but I’ve been told not in WV.
---
It does. Just craft low level handmades to scrap and learn mods.
---
It’s like they put up a PTS to shut us up but don’t actually listen to any input from it. It’s frustrating.
---
This tbh.
---
When you’re looking at a dead enemy, and the quick-loot inventory bubble pops up, you can’t use the quick stim button. (Right dpad on the x-bone)
---
I assume. Not the OP, but that’s a problem I run into when I’m panicking sometimes.
---
I'd go for the bloodied (even if I didn't have a bloodied build) simply because the accuracy on two shot weapons is too low for the minor damage bonus you get.
---
The two shot is kinda RNG unless youre using it up close, but if you don't justify a full bloodied go for the TS
---
Yes, I agree with you on this point.
---
You can get more than one rare reward a day if you're lucky and you don't clear all 3 tiers in one run. 
---
I experienced it myself today, I did a first run today that took too much time and ended unlocking only the Initiate tier, that run gave me a Brotherhood Special Ops Suit as rare reward. After that I did a second run with a different team and we managed to clear it in 5 minutes unlocking the two left tiers (paladin and elder) and got a Plan: Burrows Signs on the rare reward tab.
---
There are some issues with how Berserkers currently works that would need changing for it to be a viable build. 
---
Endurance should be the top special stat and endurance perks should be the most critical for a proper berserker build. This would mean adding in perks to synergise with that build. Like better damage reduction perks and damage avoidance perks. 
---
For example: 
---
No Pain, No Gain - 5% chance the enemies attack will heal you instead of damage you, 20% chance at max rank. (This may already be a luck perk, can't remember atm)
---
Go Berserk- increase DR for each consecutive kill, up to x, last for 30 seconds, timer refreshes on kills. 
---
Like Those Odds-  when 3 or more enemies are in a 30m rang of you, take reduced damage of x% per rank. Up to max of 15-20%. 
---
Berserkers effect needs to be adjusted to be based in damage resistance that comes strictly from armor and not from any other source like perks or mutations. A mod for armor could be added that replaces the "make" of it. For example instead of a BoS combat armor chest piece you could have a Berserker combat armor chest piece that removes its DR properties but leaves its legendary effects. This way the build can still sync with legendary effects from armor, while gaining no DR benefits.
---
Teammate’s camps are free. I have a feeling that’s what OP experienced  but doesn’t realize it was limited to teammates.
---
Yeah, all I had to do was reconnect it.
---
Will do....I currently have one handmade, but don’t have the plans.  Good place to find them?  I’ve heard west bend tunnel but all I find are dogs in there.
---
Ticks 100% worse then spiders lol they so ugly and they just sit on branches holding their arms out waiting for an unsuspecting victim walking by to latch onto. Even worse is they can jump really high...
---
If you mean the legendary rewards from the ally dailies (not the rep build questline), that’s just normal RNG.
---
Anyways, I sent in a refund request. This was going to be my first fallout game, but I'm just going to get 4 instead. I'll probably buy FO76 again when it's truly fixed.
---
I thought I was going crazy. I’d kill a scorched clearly wielding a pump-action shotgun only to end up looting a pipe pistol off of them.
---
If you notice a prefix repeats itself a lot on your drops, switch servers. Your drops are account-based and server-specific.
---
Now that's a great idea
---
I like what they're going for, but I feel it's maybe a bit bland in it's current state.
---
That's how I feel. Most of the time they get a few good hits in...then my perk cards take effect and see the error of their ways lol health regen from hell and a magic vamp combat shotty to the face puts a stop to it right quick.
---
Have you done the op before?
---
Even just an area loot where you can look at one body and see all the loot from everything you killed in the area, that would be amazing for some events
---
Subscriptions are available when you log into your PSN account via web browser
---
Bear Arms and keep both.
---
This last patch changed how you're allowed to play.
---
There's far more wrong ways than right unfortunately.
---
You'll probably have to struggle and grind out levels to respec your build to beer more meta as the patch made it mandatory if you want the same experience pre patch. 
---
Or just suffer
---
Or quit and wait for another patch
---
They’ll probably both put out very similar damage if you’re not doing a low health build. If you have the accelerated barrel on them you get the magic damage because of the limb damage secondary. I’d go test both and see which one does more damage at high health, about 50% health, then low health, if there’s no difference go with the bloodied because two shot weapons have poor accuracy.
---
He could go nuclear winter style and strip off all gear, weapons, and perk cards and try to make it through flatwoods.
---
But he can't because he has multiple characters and multiple accounts.
---
He could use the goofiest gear he has, but he can't because he has multiple characters and multiple accounts.
---
You laugh, but the struggle is real.  I know him in person and we were out getting groceries and I said "It says 'push,' just hold your hands up and go through the door."
---
He turned and looked at me.
---
I had forgotten.
---
He has multiple characters and multiple accounts.
---
The pain is real.  He collapsed on the ground sobbing.  I held him until the ambulance came.  I told them to be careful.
---
We are hopeful, but really... it is day to day.
---
Yeah it has. There’s a note on one of the inaccessible doors.
---
They better not remove it wtf
---
well fallout 4 might have been the only game you did though, so i really dont care, but ofc it could be nice.
---
This. I am carrying so many guns because of bear arms
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) for everyone here asking you to share your perk loadout, this site works wonders for planning your builds out
---
I don't know about equippable shields, but I like the power armor delpoyment system a lot actually. Imagine if you were able to deploy a barricade, portable cover, or a turret. That could be pretty awesome.
---
Yes, team mates are free but it sounded like all vendors are free.😎
---
Yes and no. I don’t believe anyone should be reprimanded because it’s technically in the games code according to the most current update.
---
Yes - it kinda ruins the economy
---
No - it helps to drive down prices on high-tier gear and makes it more accessible to lower level, newer players
---
*proceeds to open a restaurant in my C.A.M.P.*
---
Have you completed all the regular challenges? If not, work towards completing them. They still give atoms.
---
Not worst luck; pretty standard
---
Probably because they decided to make the mod plans bullion items instead of the normal scrapping mechanic.
---

They say that to people on fallout fb groups alllllll the time. Super toxic over there.
---
Just shoot more bullets bro
---
Armor effects dont really matter that much if you are going high health so I would consider power armor to make your life easier. As for weapons just pick what you like and spec into it and it will be useful (assuming youre not using a rolling pin or another meme weapon). If you dont know how to build or need suggestions I can help
---
I’ve run software shops for 20 years, there’s all kinds of flavor of agile.  There’s an agile where the boss (resource manager) is the product owner and he makes all the decisions...  company may suck, don’t know anything about them.  I’m just making assumptions...  for all we know they just didn’t do the feature because they hate us.  Lol
---
Honestly I think using scrapper perk with high INT on laser rifles is much more efficient.
---
You kill a Blood Eagle who was using a minigun against you. 
---
You loot him for a Combat shotgun, then his buddy runs over and grabs the minigun that's somehow still on his body and starts shooting you with it.
---
Makes perfect sense, no?
---
Can’t quite remember where I found mine but would be happy to mod yours. I’ll be on in about 5 or 6 hours.
---
Edit: Just now noticed it’s Xbox, I’m PS4
---
You can also get a bit pretty easily from top o the world if you're running those quests, the floatation devices where the raider mirelurk meat daily is, and any pool tables generally have a lot of pool balls you can snag.
---
None of those are as good as the highschool, but you can often do them without an extra trip.
---
I've been a melee only for 174 levels &amp; mostly get legendary melee drops. Since the Bloodied nerf I switched to big guns &amp; yesterday, for the first time on 174 levels, I got 4 legendary plasma gatlings drop. I'm convinced the 'rng' reads your inventory...
---
I'm also bloodied stealth commando and without being able to sneak sucks. I always make sure I'm with ppl to tank for me tho
---
They should be. But they are not. If you have a level 300 every new toon will have 6 slots. But cards are not shared
---
Yes they were reset as well.
---
Yup I have a vamp mini with 25% ffr with accelerated barrels, good luck killing me lol. Good im glad people want to fight me, love testing my build against players.
---
How would you know?
---
The tea time event is a great place to get all that stuff.
---
as someone building an Excavator set, i would love number 2, yet another reason to use it
---
I know that other people in this thread is saying no, but yeah Beth should experiment on PTS. We never really know how much of an impact increasing the number of player is to the server (unless ya know, testing it).
---
Everyone saying about the server performance tanking don't even know to what degree the server will tank.
---
I won't be surprised if they put on atomic shop a mr. gutsy pet that follows you and loots everything around you.
---
You're right. That's why my main toon  switches from bloodied commando to bloodied heavy gunner just for daily ops. Now, they're easy.
---
Edit: also, during daily ops, I now use a VE Gatling gun. Incoming damage no longer matters.
---
Yeah I might have exaggerated with Unarmed since the STR damage multiplier being changed to additive meant that Unarmed actually suffered more than 1h/2h Melee.
---
Yeah, I’ll take this. Who knows, maybe it’ll make the mothman stop coming to my camp every week.
---
I beg to differ they’re not stupid , they’ve come in useful many a time when I’ve had enemies in events and quests stuck in walls and I’ve managed to kill them with them so I don’t throw them away anymore
---
Get a shotgun with one of the magic effects and it really helps with mobs from day to day while you’re working out the kinks in your build, you can one or two shot most mobs in VATS only but it’s still super helpful. Try to find a shotgun with 50 limb damage, 33vats, instigating, or junkies. If you’re in Xbox I have an extra you can have for free:) But now is the time the game gets really challenging but really fun, watch angry turtles build videos and it will help you optimize your build for the new wasteland
---
&gt; It's funny how you twist the data to suit your argument 
---
It's funny that you choose to be rude without understanding what I'm trying to say first. 
---
&gt;  You're talking a very best case for PA vs not the very best case for non-PA. If you're going to compare apples with apples, you either go with the best case for both or the average case for both. 
---
YOU suggested unyielding 1\*, not me. The best case would be SS or any Uny WWR, I don't know any NORMAL ARMOR in the game that gives a unique carry bonus so I'm assuming you're talking about Excavator vs Uny wwr  Backpack   and the reason I bought up excavator is because it's purpose is to hoard stuff and mine and didn't bring up backpack is because backpack isn't unique to unyielding. 
---
Uny WWR or WWR isn't related to unyielding in itself, you can have a full set of WWR with random first star effects 
---
&gt; In both of those cases, unyielding wins handily. Using your own numbers, either 430 vs 405 or 550 vs 505. Unyielding wins in both cases. 
---
I'm trying to explain is that Unyielding needs a Backpack to surpass power armor carry weight by a large amount .  A Backpack is a very big grind compared to Excavator Power Armour.  Without Backpack, the weight is more or less close to each other unless unyielding gets so much help from other sources (deep pocket, str bonus from 2nd legendary mind you another grind to get uny str, so more carry wieght is somewhat justified because matching pieces are annoying to farm ) 
---
I'm saying that power armor should be given the same opportunities to get extra bonuses  as well with it's own additional weight bonuses . Like instead of increasing str from 1-11 for under 10 str players, just give 50 bonus carry weight  to the chassis .
---
Nerfing isn't the same as balancing in some situations.
---
&gt; 430 vs 405 or 550 vs 505.
---
Does this take into account the weight of the armor itself which tends to be very large (15-30lb per set with said mods depending on the set ) because of mods such as deep pocket and polymer/Buttressed , Power armor weight is weightless because the chassis that carries it. 
---
Power armor cannot access WWR but there are many perks that help reduce this problem (pistol weight reduction, bear arms.etc) however there isn't one for rifles and a perk for rifle weight reduction should be introduced ( not sure why this isn't here in the first place)
---
Isn't really worth the time and resources. Armor is superbuffed and drops are crap, especially with SBQ and her 1 star nocturnals. Could also go for a huge XP increase for quest completion.
---
Hello american citizen, do you, by any chance, sell these chems? If you, we would gladly buy them off of your hands.
---
Nice! What’d you get for the trouble?
---
Thanks, don’t know how I missed the note.
---
With the scattershot perk you can carry as many shotguns as you need. I carry about 10 but use 7 regularly. I have a gun for any occasion. For high level bosses, hit with the instigating, switch to an enemy specific one for a bit, then on to the executioners to finish the job.
---
only ever turned pacifist off once and that was for killing my friend for the achievement :P then its on again. dont care for pvp at all and if i wanna try it i go in nuclear winter, but not even tried that once ever so far hehe.
---
Today is a nasty one on Bloodied, even if you dial it back. I'm struggling to find a team to get through it on my B-Commando. Missed Elder by 20 seconds on my last run. 10 server hops so far, and ten minutes trying to build a team on one server, and nada. Plenty of 'finished' groups staying together to piss me off though.
---
the legendary ammo perk gave my character effectively unlimited ammo
---
so sure buff the amount crafted to help low levels, not like giving me unlimited+ is gonna make a difference
---
Yeah, I've decided to just grind to level 300 instead of starting a new run. Maybe if Beth updates the game so that the cards are universal, I'll do another run.
---
Thanks!!
---
I think you can split the difference a bit still, and make weapons line up better. I'm even okay with the Double Barrel/Pump/Combat shogun dice roll when I kill a shotgun scorched. At least they are all shotguns.
---
Just don't make the raider firing off green plasma bolts at me drop a pipe pistol.
---
It's just rng. You have a 5, 10, and 80% chance. Rng just hates you. I went 2 days without a rare reward
---
I’ve read that some people just sneak through a silo in their Chinese Stealth suit. I’m sure combat will be a pain after this week’s patch.
---
U play PS4? I've got a full vampire's build would love comparing difference in perks and equipment sometime.
---
Cool, but that wasn’t my question. I can have an ally *and* kill a behemoth. I just want to know if one particular ally typically gives better rewards ... like the ones with the storylines or the randos or if it even matters.
---
Fallout 4 is great fun, enjoy!
---
I just hope loadouts come out for consoles, but on PC we have a great version i wouldn't change for anything bethesda can get out.
---
Do what I do.
---
If they are not on the objective dont revive them. If they haven't been on the objective kick them before it gets finished.
---
Too much dipping into our own supply but we rotate stock often!
---
How about soloing special ops getting elder rank an$ starting with a pipe rifle?
---
Check out this Angry Turtle Video
---
https://youtu.be/Iwke6ZPPOLY
---
you have to tweak the build to be more tanky and get a VE weapon. at least that's my plan. i dunno if it will work
---
That's what I assumed it to be, I just started getting worried when it was no reward for 4 days on my second character 🥺
---
Sounds mysterious,  like a murder mystery artifact 😁
---
If I’m hearing you correctly, you are saying that the are tired of struggling to “figure out your loadout” after 45 levels, and would prefer not to have to struggle another 45 levels to “optimize your equipment” like everyone is telling you to do.
---
I hear you.  The game is once again more un-fun, than fun, due to balance issues.  All that figuring out is time consuming for a non-lifer who has to work for a living and can’t dedicate themselves to full time gaming.
---
I disagree. Soloed elder rank every day as a bloodied stealth commando.
---
So it doesn’t matter if I have one with a storyline or one of the random encounters? They have the same RNG?
---
And after you have got the desired mutations from serums, don't forget to "lock" them with the level 2 Starched Genes perk. And level 3 Class Freak is also recommended to greatly reduce their penalties.
---
Refractor perk, troubleshooter weapons, X01 armor for starters. Possibly a grounded serum if that's your thing. It really depends on if you're running the silo just to complete the quest, or if you're going to be running it on a regular basis for ACP or SBQ.
---
It’s not impossible, just switch some perk cards around to mitigate damage. I don’t mind not being able to sneak, it gets boring after a while
---
VATs glitches out and won’t hit a damn thing even though it says “95%” sometimes. Only way I’ve gotten it to “fix” itself is exiting VATS real quick then re-engaging VATS. Usually works. Still super annoying wasting VATS and ammo. Almost as annoying as the fast travel bug from healing factor...almost.
---
Like a Futurama dimension jumping whale?😎
---
My friend and I found the silo pretty easy last night. I did a queen nuke cos damn my expl weapons break quick.
---
What I was referring to was game breaking. Not minor ones such as floating and t posing mobs which was the most common. The others were pretty few an far between. We only notice the bad and none of the good.
---
The only inconvenience I really ran into was crashing in nuke zones in a couple of minutes. 
---
The overseer quest where you kill the guy was not difficult to overcome with server hopping. I managed to kill in a couple of hops. Yes there were stuff like like that but not game breaking or console destroying like I was pointing out people were making it out to be.
---
The game right now is in a much better state then it was. I rarely ever run into any bugs anymore unless I purposefully try to make it happen.
---
Im basically running it just to complete the quest
---
&gt;it was definitely duped at some point. 
---
Not entirely accurate. There were legitimate drops, otherwise they couldn’t have been duped.
---
But I would agree with ‘*almost* definitely’.
---
This is important. Unless you are currently in an uplink location, no revives from me. Sustained dps is more important than picking up someone who is not in zone.
---
I carried my team with 4 seconds left on the clock for elder today. If I'd stopped to pick up the lv 100 who dropped while clearing the mob just before "boss", we wouldn't have made it.
---
I *know* that as I did 100% of the bosses hp. No one else bothered to chase him with seconds left ticking.
---
awesome. :D
---
Didn't thought about that, but I have seen quite a few posts about lower lvls struggling with damage now. Maybe having the full damage boost from cards at lower levels isn't such a big deal now, with damage bonuses being additive and enemies scaling.
---
uhm... press ESC?
---
Theres some vids in YouTube
---
But thank you for the weapon and armor tips! I will definitely be looking for the troubleshooter weapons. They seem very handy
---
It's a LOT better than it used to be.
---
I remember finding 3x 10mm rounds and being like "really Bethesda??"
---
Now it's regularly 10+
---
Also.... Crafting really is the way:
---
Excavator Power Armor:
---
Hornwright Testing Site #3,
---
Lucky Hole Mine,
---
Hemlock Holes Maintenance,
---
Lewisburg station (gym),
---
Green County Lodge (gym),
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary (yard),
---
White springs resort (ALLL the coat hangers and baskets!!)
---
Get to know those places
---
Crafting:
---
Ammo smith
---
Super-Duper
---
And the legendary ammo perk card
---
Maybe make it so that we can level up level 50 weapons? Just put like a hard grind behind it, I think its justifiable.
---
Can you link one to me please?
---
I have over 1300 racked up now &amp; I only had 3 complaints. 1: I really want to place a fast travel mat at my camp that only I can use. (My spawn point is stupid!) 2: Fast travel for free to Foundation &amp; Crater (yay, they did it!) 3: they broke me 😔 I was Bloodied Melee only and yesterday I had no choice but to entirely change my build. My beloved MMG is useless now, might as well be hitting enemies with feather dusters. Its too dangerous to approach a lvl 100 with melee &amp; hardly any health. So yeah, this nerf really upset me. Aside from that, I love the game, hence +1300 hours.
---
I used to be annoyed at the price of Fallout 1st but honestly, it was a game changer for me in the best way. I bought a year outright &amp; I will resub next year too. Plus all those delicious atoms every month 😀
---
I'm a happy chick!
---
Yeah, I have a feeling OP either mistyped or misunderstood what happened.
---
Oh the rage when I get stuck in a scared thing and get gang banged by 20 wendigos in a corner and can’t do a damn thing about it.
---
Any recommendations on what cards to swap? I’m trying to do exactly this, using a V handmade
---
Oh, that seems like a smart idea. But yeah, definitely will be painful
---
that is impressive. thumbs up.
---
nothing. :D
---
Why u running one handed damage perks with a 2handed glaive big boy
---
Nice so basically farm the super mutants.
---
that's the spirit.
---
i was scratching my head when i saw that you could not go full james bond stealth + max pistol perks + stealth perks. such a limiting perk system.
---
I wouldnt mind it one bit. Why does Jimmy get a Bloodied Explosive 50 cal and I get a nocturnal wood left arm?
---
Well, gladiator does not benefit the glaive as it's a two handed weapon, not one handed.
---
In the rad-hole. Duh.
---
Last 2 time I was in it, the game crash. Only 2 times I’ve seen it since one wastland.
---
What is this gun that you are after?
---
Oh right i totally didnt realize this. Still I hear that even wityout the perks its incredibly strong
---
Exactly my friend :)
---
To be honest, I don’t know if anything like that is there, but it wouldn’t be the first Easter Egg in Fallout from Douglas Adam’s work. It wouldn’t surprise me if they did it again.
---
I know the person who originally took this, its from Xbox. Any more lies for attention? The person who took the pic was running solo. They dont have Reddit, and originally posted it on a FB group.
---
Maybe!?🙄 I like finding out of place and puzzling artifacts. If you go down in the Crater there is a face embedded in the dirt/rock with roots growing over it. Nice touch from Bethesda. I also like the Stonr Henge/Georgia Guidestones type memorial near the nuclear disposal site. The Flatwoods Monster attacked me there.😀
---
War glave is a 2 handed weapon, you need Slugger
---
If you’re using a vampires gun it’s a bit over kill. But Barbarian in strength, ironclad in endurance, nerd rage in int, evasive in agi, serendipity in luck. Those are what I have atm, could also have Ricochet. I’ve had to use legendary perks to boost my special tho.
---
It's really confusing that everything seems to have different reset timers.
---
True, well tbf I would actually rather it be easier to get the cool raider outfits and to get these outfits more easily, this might be controversial but I feel like it will me a major QoL change
---
The servers are on AWS. All they need to do to give us more server stability and larger servers is to give back some of the money they're making off of the Atomic shop and Fallout 1st to the people that are actually playing the game.
---
What's that called? Oh yeah, customer satisfaction. Well that's not going to happen.
---
I hope we get DLC with more liberators...like, Liberator Prime...
---
Pretty much, I’ve literally got stuck before from this bug and tried to fast travel TWENTY times and nothing. I even moved about the map between tries, swapped weapons, fires shots, nothing. It’s SO refreshing that my alt character doesn’t have healing factor because fast travel “just works”.
---
They really should have made them tradeable, it'd be nice for there to be a better chance somebody is selling a plan that I currently lack. Especially when buy/sell is a daily, I usually end up buying a singular ammo shell and calling it a night after visiting 5 stores
---
I’ve obtained a rare on main and secondary in the same day, but yeah it just RNG
---
Between the regular and the energy damage ur doing 280 that’s not bad at all, 12 strength is pretty low my 2h melee main typically has around 25-35
---
Is auto tesla bugged? In my experience lately only the first hit of VATS dealt full damage, but not the subsequent ones? Can you test it on your char?
---
Joins the club!
---
Nah im xbox but I run a variety just for imposter and pvp I use vamp to give me the extra op healing. I can solo the imposter sheep fight care free without chems or mutations. Its the only thing in the game that has a chance at killing me. I dont do great damage however but thats the role of a tank.
---
If the scrip limit was removed and scrip was more rewarding then people might invest in rubbish legendaries for the scrip. I have over 15 3 star junk weapons and I can only get rid of 3 per day but doing daily ops and getting more gear I have to only scrip one or two of them and whatever I get that's new
---
Most likely because alot of people use low health builds that boost damage by itself.
---
The storyline ones can grant unique legendaries like The Final Word. But after that, they should just be RNG. 
---
I haven’t really pursued them much, personally.
---
The TS is already magic, the Bloodied could be with an accelerated barrel. The TS will need to be repaired constantly though. 
---
If you play low health, use an accelerated Bloodied.
---
Yeah I mostly chose the energy one because it looks like Stormbringer from Avengers xD
---
Yup, I’ve noticed a significant uptick in blue screens since the patch and I’m on PS4.
---
The first time it happened it actually fixed a bug though. For two days straight after the patch my mic wouldn’t work in game (did work in other games) and I tried a number of things to get it to work again. Nothing helped until I got my first BSOD then bam, mic works again.
---
&gt;Can I ask a related question: does a player really need lockpick (or hacker) at all?
---
Nope they are so rarely usefull that swaping them is not that big of a deal. Ofcourse im talking about endgame when you are not realy exploring the map. They are usefull early game when you can get some mats and extra story pieces from them
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi7vCS5OZW4
---
Yeah I have adrenal reaction which boosts damage
---
This was datamined quite some time back before Wastelanders. Servers have a seed that dictates what tier loot you may find. It may be different now but from my experience recently, it is not.
---
I agree it's dumb. Should be able to sell them like the rest. FYI floater flamer grenades can kill enemy through walls. If you have a spawn stuck inside a wall this will take care of them. Saved me in d ops more than once.
---
Haha, I actually like the SCORE grind, but that reputation and boullion grind is awful the second time around. Started an alt to try out a different build and I am not looking forward to the rep grind one bit.
---
Who the Fuck is going to buy them though 🤪?
---
Isn't the second shot from TS random?
---
I meant to a robot vendor.
---
My favorite is exploding non legendary robots that always seem to get me
---
Oh, actually its the opposite for me. I've been finding them ALOT more since the patch. Probably just luck
---
Well that's what I get for answering while I'm out. In clearly not reading your questiin right.
---
If it were me, I’d drop all of the shotgun perks. Your block enchantment on the armor makes them “magic” in vats. Shotguns outside of vats are worthless anyway. 
---
And I assume you have the hunting rifle for more of range. I’d make mod the handmade with long barrel and strong auto receiver and go automatic with commando. You could still maintain range bursts but gain some usability. 
---
I’d also drop most of the “eating” perks like lead belly and either make yourself more of a tank with survival perks. 
---
You seem like you have half of a few different builds going on. So you don’t need to fully respec by any means, but you probably should look at picking certain types of guns and narrowing it down a bit to one or two types. But the magic shotgun does not need any perks to it. I’ve had the same one for 40 levels and have 0 shotgun perks. It still kills most enemies in one shot and almost all in two or 3 minus bosses. 
---
Sorry for the rambling hope that at least gave some ideas.
---
Edit: saw you didn’t want commando. 
---
Maybe remove some shotgun perks and get more luck and go for critical banking. I’m a luck commando build personally. My range is pathetic, but up close I do pretty good damage with an AA 10mm sub.
---
I always assumed it was Bethesda hinting at the thunderbird cryptid. I read that thunderbirds hunted whales in myth, I always thought those skeletons were dropped by them and Bethesda was setting them up as a replacement for the Scorchbeasts as an enemy down the line.
---
The effect obv can’t be implemented in online play. You’ll have to use head canon to explain why it is t in Appalachia
---
Now I would like to see a dimensional portal in the game that would take you to the secret Zeta alien base.👽
---
Yup! I’m def digging the music switch up, they should do that more often. Speaking of new music, the slocum vendor and the wandering traveler could really use a new tune. They get on my nerves after awhile for sure. That, or a silent mode for companions/vendors.
---
Myron basically refined/modified the process to be able to use Brahmin dung. Sort of like we modified the Nuka-Cola process to make the Nuka-Vaccine. 
---
He just exaggerated his efforts to make everyone *think* he was the only source, and therefore indispensable.
---
Yea that is not uncommon in games, I do not understand why that means switching servers would help? It's still entirely up to chance what comes next, unless you know more details about it? I'm genuinely curious
---
... You poor soul. Here’s hoping you get lucky tomorrow and earn yourself a symptomatic.
---
I only hear that message during the public event Lode Bearing when we have to escape the mine
---
Im a casual lvl 30 and Im just now realizing how ridiculously stupid it was for me to go pistol/shotgun build....
---
My best advice is to search on YT what late game build you're planning to go for. Early game build doesn't really matter since every 5 levels you have to find a new gun appropriate to your level anyway- just focus on survivability. Transitioning from a mid game build to a late game build is really time consuming, so except you're planning to stop playing after finishing the main storyline, I suggest working from top to bottom.
---
No just base ammo
---
It’s alright. :)
---
Because exploiters were exploitin. Will be back im sure once they patch the exploit.
---
Would allow people to eventually 1 shot everything if they let it be.
---
They are disabled for now because of a glitch that let you stack your strength buff over and over.
---
But.... but.... but... I keep reading that this new update is no big deal and we’re all a bunch of casuals who should spend all our time from day 1 playing moving towards the perfect build to be untouchable, you did that right? Right??
---
My camp is in whitesprings lol, I deal with that a lot
---
Personally I find robots the easiest faction.
---
I went to 3 servers last night that had a nuke radius on both locations.
---
ah cool thanks, buddy thought the ranks would be gone if you removed it.
---
It's a PR stunt. They use it as an excuse so people think they are listening
---
Well yea, ditch the stealth part because stealth doesn’t exist in the uplink Ops. I bring my health to about a third, then it seems to be fine. The resilient gutsies still hurt, a lot, but the rest of the Ops are totally fine. Just gotta switch up the loadout a bit.
---
The people complaining about the perks don't actually play the game mode. If you listen to this subreddit, you aren't getting an accurate idea of what really needs to be done with the game mode. The majority here are adventure mode and anti-pvp.  
---
The perks could be balanced but it's one of the unique things about this battle royale that the rest don't have. So it should stay.   
---
The game should be a separate game from Fallout 76 though and should be free to play on Steam.  
---
2 minute lobbys need to be changed.  
---
New players aren't having a negative experience because of perk loadouts or frog legs. It's just that they just act as food when a curated team of all level 200+ acting as a cohesive team cross their path. You could take all of that teams perk cards away and they would still get mowed down.  
---
The mode needs balance through limiting these curated teams, or by simply implementing a solo or duos mode. If you have a team of 4 mode, make it so you can only invite one friend to your team. Then, your other two OP friends can play on another team and likely those teams will have something to look forward to in the match because they likely will face off against each other. I don't understand why great players think it's fun to play NW on easy mode.
---
lore-wise, jet existed pre-war and Myron is a lying scumbag.
---
gameplay wise, they cant have something that "slows time" vuz its an online game. if they ever add it to 76, it'll probably just boost your speed or AP or something.
---
Oh, well I’ve been living under a rock it seems 😂 Thank you
---
Outside of player vendors and npc vendors, doing the manhunt event rewards you with 120 caps for 3 minutes of your time.
---
I like everything but the suggestions about unarmed. They got nerfed hard
---
I wish they would have just subbed the daily op challenge in place of the NW one.
---
And Ra-Ra is level 50 now too!
---
The Fancy Shotgun. 
---
It’s only available by turning in Pleasant Valley tickets. I’ve turned in exactly 90 so far. No luck. And I haven’t picked up a new ticket in about a week.
---
Commando power armor or commando OR power armor/heavy weapon.  Because commando in power armor isn't a thing.
---
Oof. I’m surprised I hadn’t heard about it. I’m glad I’m not having a bug at least. Thank you.
---
I ran it several times today. Once I used a magazine that gives you a 30% chance to avoid energy damage 
---
It helped that time I used it.
---
I think there’s a couple different mags that allow you to avoid different kinds of damage.
---
So I’m going to check that out more. If your avoiding g the game you’re not getting slowed.
---
Also my cursed harpoon works amazing on the bots. 1-2 shots. Then each would give me lots of harpoons. I started with just 30, ended with over 480. 
---
The faster you can take them out the better too.
---
I’ve done it 4 times already today on elder still no plans....
---
No problem
---
Call it "Rad Away?"
---
Usually I use them more so to try and get people to gather up for an event. 
---
Usually gets ignored
---
Developers are not the ones who determine that it's the people who handle the money and most times they're not overly concerned with making things work tech wise but more focused on bringing people into the game time and time again.
---
ammo factory best legendary perk
---
Just throw them. It's way less annoying.
---
It’s pretty lame that a radroach or mole rat can take me out if I’m not paying attention. I used to just ignore them if I was in the middle of buying from a vendor or in my menu, now that’s not an option on my bloodied build. That said, my alt character gained 17 levels yesterday alone so...I’ll take the change. So much experience gained all over the map now!
---
I’d be down for it... and would love to be able to give a explo plasma to my punky ally !!!
---
Who will defend this CAMP!!!
---
I would only want to see this if it where in tiers like all other legendary perks and at max level would be 20% total HP.
---
That's a really interesting idea and it also instantly reminded me of the huge bird corpse pinned to the side of Seneca Rocks. I wonder if that's intended to be the thunderbird.
---
There was one moment when I was perma frosted for about 10 to 15 seconds, by 10mm shooting gutsies. I just had a chuckle and put down the controller. 
---
They did too little damage to kill me (power armor, electric absorption rank 1) and the uplink wasn't affected by me being frozen xd.
---
Challenge just started last week so far I gotten 300 points but I'm hoping to get enough for a Halloween bundle
---
That's possible but I like to go to the Morgantown highschool 😁
---
nuke it and ppl will come, always do when i drop em.
---
So are you able to sell it and drop it without it being destroyed?
---
i love these signs.
---
I really wish more people could figure this out. The only downside I've found is that people will not realize ACP has triggered after doing scorched earth so I'll end up with one or two people running it. Not a huge deal since I can solo Earl but it's nice to save the ammo. (Although daily ops and the new legendary perk has made worrying about ammo a thing of the past.)
---
Are a lot more than I realized, and so.e essential for my camps design.
---
Good point! I do think with enemies scaling it would be bad to have no restrictions on the damage cards though.
---
Get the SS armor and then the buttressed mod. Plus the jetpack. If you have the bullions get the helmet for the look of it.😁 rolling a good set of limbs and arms is difficult so good luck.
---
 Because the bench was bugged, letting you stacking the strength buff. In this case it’s Bethesda’s doing and I like that they could turn it off without shutting things done.

Having some connection issues now too.  Disconnected to switch worlds, now I can't get back into Private or Public servers.
---
I didn't notice myself taking any rad damage at all.
---
This Op has me rethinking a Troubleshooters build
---
Yep, I finally primed my gauss shotgun because I end up with way more ammo in daily ops than I burn. I actually farm daily ops now to keep my guass minigun stocked up.
---
Na man, go electric absorption in power armor
---
That would require animating and programming it. You must be new to bethesda games, famous for struggling with these two things.
---
I see lots of players in Power Armor with Automatic Rifles ..... that is what I meant.  I seems like the default way to play the game.  Boring.
---
You can only unlock the chance at elder rewards once a day! So that's why you're not getting any 
---
You can repeat daily ops but you wont get those chances at rare rewards after your first elder completion
---
Huh. I guess she got caught in the fast travel beam.
---
If you want extra Survivability I’d say so. The damage it reflects back is garbage though
---
I got it on my 3 attempt with my level 10 friend, surprisingly he never died, proud of my little buddy
---
I keep my TSE handmade because (I fucked up my perk deck at the time) when tse wasn't patched. There was no perks just **TSE.** So Im keeping it as a relic to remind of the fun times. 
---
And I didn't find out until someone on the reddit said that TSE has a increased durability decrease
---
I don't think I've ever seen someone in power armor with a rifle.  Maybe you mean the lmg.  Heavy weapons and power armor are a blast.  If you want to play Robin hood though, be my guest.
---
I don't think the War Glaive plan is tradable.
---
Dude, them gutsies are shooting .50 cal armor piercing or some shit.  Toughest enemy in the game.  One time I saw a pack of 3 take down a 3 Star Legendary Scorchbeast no problem.  lol.
---
Are those tradable?
---
Magic minigun is OP.
---
Oh no, anyway
---
I will gladly take all of your floater grenades.
---
Nice try commie, we had our properly earned powers and they were stolen for "equality". Maybe you should have a chat with Internal Security...
---
I think you're simultaneously lucky and unlucky. Lucky to be getting a reward at all, and you could potentially trade your extras for the plans you do want, but unlucky because I know it's disappointing anyways. Hope you get something new next time!
---
Sadly not. Idk why.
---
Just did a solo run on my main after taking off and putting back on all my perks. My weapons seem to be much more effective now. Got 8:14. Fortunately, immediately before that run me and my squad made up of randoms, one of whom was level 50, took on the robots 3 vs. a lot, and utterly destroyed them at 6:19. Still no rare rewards.
---
IDK about Earl, but Fireproof1 protects against SB sonics, molotovs, and similar.
---
 AFAI can tell, it also provides some level of protection against explosives, in that I can stand next to an exploding car (or two) and live to tell about it.  Also I no longer kill myself when I am firing an explosive rifle at those pesky mole rats biting my ankles - neither of which I could do prior to equipping FP1.
---
Now that I think about it, given the amount of asbestos SS armor requires to craft/repair, I wonder if SS armor has some (undocumented) level of fireproof built in?
---
There's some major Rad barrels where the boss appears &gt;50rad/sec. Don't hang around near the corners.
---
Use one till it breaks, then the other.
---
Shouldn't ever wear it at all until the Stealth focused ops come around. It's very poor armor for the Ops themselves considering you'll constantly be under fire.
---
I mean, I personally don't think the game is hard for high leveled players.  Newer players, sure, but it always had been.  What level are you?
---
Maybe she got elected mayor of Grafton
---
So basically never turn *off* "Pacifist"...
---
Try not using a meme weapon, the game gets much more rewarding.
---
Yeah! I love fusion core charging shots!!! I think the Electrically Charged mutation also heals me??
---
Ever since this new patch, every time I’ve seen someone below level 50 I’ve given them like 30 stims, rada way, my extra plans, and all my ammo (Im melee toon).
---
Every gift you give transforms one complaint Reddit post to a shout out reddit post and that makes it worth it every time.
---
Ah rip mate....
---
I’m sorry to hear
---
Yes, it does heal you.  That's why robots are my favorite faction.  Because they can't do any damage to me.
---
You should see me swinging my súper sledge for 20 seconds
---
I switched out some perks, equipped some armor with troubleshooter and/or "chance to reduce damage while standing" and I didn't have any problems.
---
There is a section in MW2 where you are on a minigun on the back of a humvee and when you ADS it spins up. I always wished Miniguns in other games did that as well.
---
I haven't done any on teams yet but my tactic is to clear mobs out after I'm on the objective. Anything before that feels like a waste of time and resources. Seems simple enough, get to the objective area find a parking spot and hang in there until it's done or the boss is dead.
---
For sure! I would love silent mode on companions. If I have to hear Daguerre complain or hear her swoon over me one more time...I swear she’s going out an airlock. 
---
I know we don’t have airlocks but I’ll make do damn it!
---
The servers definitely have a state of instability to them
---
Sorry that you're having connection issues, though
---
I had it happen to my gatling plasma.  Kill them before they get close to you.
---
They really did melee dirty with this update
---
I have a VATS Anti-Armor Shotgun build. Typically 1 to 2 shot kills on robots but I still can't kill them fast enough to avoid being completely frozen.
---
They want people to grind.
---
This is what duping has reduced the trade market to. Anything new will get offers from people with plenty of legacy's, duped scrap and other exploited stuff just sitting around on alt mules. The regular player doesn't stand a chance.
---
And dupe all the valuable plans.
---
The Blood Eagles fight with laser weapons was an awesome experience today😁
---
I see medium event , 32 level player versus 50 legendary and of course event failed
---
it's just amazing that even in something so simple they  failed, its a simple  gradation of difficulty. Or in Bethesda they thought that the events would be played only by 100+l players...
---
Ooh freezing robots in v94 where you get so little cover. Literally the only thing worse than resilient burrows robots, ez
---
What platform u on chief 
---
Edit: jk I’m dumb and on PC
---
Yeah, a lot of high level enemies tend to have laser weapons, which means they don't do any damage to me either.
---
10mm? Those things shoot 50.cal armor piercing explosive rounds or something. They deal tons of damage quickly lol. I was SO frozen, my game froze and when it returned to normal I was dead and had to respawn.
---
Makes perfect sense, then. Duly noted. Last time I had the minigun and kept further away. This time was shotgun, so yeah. Now if the robots dealt rad damage, that would be an intresting mutation. Enemies deal significant radiation damage.
---
The robot at the end of the vault op is just terrifying. It's a fuckin level 100 assaultron (for me) that has the arms of a sentry bot, so it's just firing a hail of minigun fire while ALSO using it's head beam, and the miniguns still apply the freeze effect so you're immediately turned into a popsicle while it simultaneously melts you!
---
Rank 1 was all it takes
---
I think I’m gonna start doing that, even for 5 caps plans have mostly just stopped moving other than the rare vendor ones
---
I spent a good 10 minutes moving it around, scrapping and replacing it  moving walls, etc,.
---
Then like right after giving up saw the news XD
---
What game are you playing if you’ve never seen a player in Power Armor with a handmade automatic rifle?  Almost Every player in Power Armor pulls out a Handmade more often than they do a heavy weapon.  
---
And now with the changes, more and more players who had put away therir Power Armor are getting back into their Power Armor with their Bloody/Commando builds.
---
I almost never use Power Armor now, my normal armor gives better damage protection than my power armor. Guese I'll need to optimize it lol
---
No burrows?
---
If we dont complain how would they know
---
In my opinion at early levels melee is the way to go, or another possibility is to sell everything you find to vendorbots, then buy ammo at 1 cap per round from player vendors. Try to use weapons that have low ammo consumption. Daily ops can also help, I always come out with a big net profit on ammo.
---
Yup. I always go straight for the objective and ignore everything on the way to objective.
---
Once the booster and the 2 uplinks are done, its a race to kill all the marked mobs. 
---
Then head directly to the boss, which in this case is always just up the stairs next to the atrium where the mob is. 
---
As a solo, you only have about 10 to 20 seconds of give to make elder rank, and I always run these assuming I'm carrying/solo, even if it's a full squad.
---
Next year could be the last year this game will be supported with dlc. Bethesda has more important projects to work on like elder scrolls 6. I can't imagine them making more free dlc when 76 bigger brother is making so much more money and has a far larger player base than fallout 76. It's the only reason I can think of that elder scrolls online gets a next Gen upgrade and 76 doesn't. 76 has too much jank in the programming to not be worth fixing but who knows maybe they will continue to make dlc but as a business stand point the end is near for active in game events and dlc.
---
Thanks! I’ll go with heavy weapons. But I really don’t know which one.
---
DR is irrelevant compared to the innate damage resistance pa gives.
---
Fellow heavy junkies here (though I'm a non explosive type). Build looks good, though I'm personally thinking that you might be better off taking some points out of endurance and maxing out tenderizer and suppressor - because you've got take one for the team, you are basically wanting the bad guys to target you, so reducing their output and upping your dmg is the way forward. If you're worried about health, one rank of born survivor and super stim packs (or use a medic pump on your armour).
---
To be honest though that's very nit picky, you'd be fine as is :) ooo though if you stick with power armour reboot, stick revenant in for the sweet sweet dmg boost :)
---
Step one, play Uranium Fever.
---
Step two, collect everything off the dead mobs. 
---
Step three, walk your over encumbered ass to the very nearby train station and sell. 
---
Step four, profit. 
---
If you do this right, you can clear out the vendor of caps in one sitting.
---
If you get close range to where the boss spawns in vault 94, there are rad barrels that were fairly strong. Running at 40% hp, all of a sudden I was down to a fraction of health due to rads lol
---
Thanks. And same to you
---
I tend to not give up easily when camp building is concerned.  So probably fought it alot longer than I should have.  :/
---
Because Daily Ops are new and thus more exciting. It will balance itself over time.
---
It's a glitch that we're even being given them, they're craft able gold bullion rewards, the glitch makes me happy that I never spent gold on them as they're all worse than frag grenades!
---
Yup.  Even better.  Although I am interested in testing rank 4 on the ISS when I have the chance.
---
By going to the Bethesda forums and posting it there?  
---
Bethesda doesn’t really officially monitor these forums, although some community managers check in occasionally.
---
Would be far less of an issue if teams could actually communicate together with text chat in a quick manner no matter how scattered to hell they may be on the main map.
---
Bethesda is too lazy to actually implement base online game features for some reason or another. Mics are not a solution.
---
Gutsies come in energy, ballistic and occasionally melee. 
---
Outside daily ops, ballistic gutsies drop 10 mm as loot. It's 10 mm :) Just think of it as prenerf bloodied explosive 10mm haha
---
Hacker is great for nuke runs to shut down those loud ass turrets; I mostly use lockpicking to break into other people’s camps and get a bounty.
---
You expected them to have a feature that exists for almost no other surface in the game outside of rain hitting water?
---
Yeah, I wear pa, so rads aren't a problem for me.
---
Yeah that happened to me a lot as well. I'm curious if that's somehow connected. I haven't seen Lode Bearing pop up since the update, but if it does, I'll do it and see if that helps.
---
Edit: It was indeed connected. At some point after Lode Bearing I didn't redeem my tokens (I guess I wanted to save them up) and I was getting a quest directive to do so at the beginning of every session. I just did so, joined a new world, and no message from Melody.
---
That auto-stim with a Minigun sounds awesome. What specific heavy weapon should I go for? If I can be picky that is.
---
Mega sloth hunting, here we go.
---
Wow.. never thought about the stealth armor but makes perfect sense!!!
---
You know you can repair it all with one button click?
---
"Fix all"
---
Mine is at the snake, I always end up at the miner memorial. Which isn't too bad, considering the random spawn nearby.
---
Hitting glass?? It’s pretty much a joke. We get rained on it every other structure we build
---
It was a joke, I highly doubt any of Bethesda read 90% of the posts here
---
The miniguns and laser miniguns are decent but i prefer 50 cal and the gatling gun. The plasma caster is also pretty good but it boils down to preference.
---
Perhaps instead of it being a legendary card, they could introduce legendary helmets that give build specific perks. Like a bloody helmet that gives the bloody perfect radiation healing?
---
Fighting Molerats it's as terrifying as the movie tremors now 😆
---
I find that those kinds of enemies deal the same amount of damage to me in or out of my power armor. Maybe I'm not doing the armor thing right or I'm just dumb.
---
👍🏾
---
PA Heavy Weapons. But what PA and what Heavy Weapon? No SH or T-65 since I don’t have the gold bullion to buy those.
---
Reloading my Dragon is impossible too!
---
Thanks, was curious about it :)
---
So the first time you unlock elder and get nothing erases the rest of your chances for a rare drop for the remainder of the day?
---
You have excavator?
---
The ops glitched out and auto completed for me today... It said I've done it today when I only did it yesterday!
---
Thankfully this is a per character problem unlike when it happens to challenges!
---
Log out when someone starts doing this.  Don’t stay there and just let it happen.
---
Do you run at full health or bloodied?
---
Thanks! That’s appreciated.
---
If you have the supplies yea. Luckily i did but just like WHY
---
I see it coming to firsf
---
Vanguard, full health
---
No super mutants in the Burrows means automatic disqualification as an optimal place to farm.
---
Ah, sounds fair. Thank you!
---
I did when i realized it- but like, why does someone do this. I don't get it.
---
Came to post this exact link, mine’s a bit different than his but no problem dying with Daily OPS or anything else for that matter especially with a vampire’s fixer.
---
Yeah it’s not on anyone’s list of must have guns but I like my shotgun build. And I’ve gotten nothing remotely close from the purveyor or vendors.
---
You said SEEING raindrops hitting the roof. You don't SEE that happen anywhere else, the rain just stops at the surface in all other cases.
---
Yeah, but before I got the marsupial mutation and having to go the long way around took a bit of time, just kinda made my experience a bit annoying, but now I'm stationed over in the cranberry bog, near those 5 or 6 random encounter locations
---
I thought so once ..... now.  Pistols are obsolete in this game. 
---
 Bethesda knew their changes were putting pistols on the endangered list and tried to mitigate it be extending Tank Killer to them, but AA and Tank Killer were already nulifiers, and pistols don’t have the damage or fire rate necessary to make any impact on the new bullet sponges of mobs at present.
---
Pretty much the same for me too.
---
Doesn’t pacifist mode make it so this doesn’t happen?
---
So, does this mean having a full set of sneak armor is viable now? I am going for PA heavy. That stealth suit is good!
---
Craft them, use super duper.
---
Emergency protocols on pa negates 50% of incoming damage at low health, makes you feel like full health, to be honest
---
lol people were killing sbq in 2 hits with unarmed attacks because they had 100 strength.
---
Yeah, I can craft it.
---
Because they are asshats. Block them, leave the server, fix all from your CAMP module, and move forward. 
---
Don’t give them the satisfaction of knowing they annoyed you to the point of going on Reddit to gripe about it. 
---
That’s how they win; by getting an emotional reaction out of you.
---
OMG, my bad dude. thanks for the correction...smh
---
Graveyard smash! Oh hey... That gives me an idea
---
There are ways around that, unfortunately.
---
Let me let you in on a little secret: it's just as good as t65.  I've tested them both on the hardest hitting enemy I know and excavator took 5 more damage than t 65.
---
Put emergency protocols on the torso.  It negates 50% of oncoming damage at low health.
---
I had 2 pretty solid groups and both were in the 6 minute range.  It was honestly pretty boring, full set of troubleshooter armor and a vamp gun turns it into a walk in the park.  The most tedious part was finding the enemies at the last site to get the boss to spawn in.
---
Thanks! It’s hard to choose.
---
Hadn’t seen this message, join me anytime
---
Lol shocka +1
---
The helmet is a gas mask too I think.
---
I can say the damage perks are lacking to a point where I would rather use QOL perks rather than the damage perks themselves they seem so useless to me but the damage isn't that noticeable imo
---
I’ve been hoarding my plans and every other day after a public event or if I run past a low level “I’m only lv95” I drop them all my plans and extra ammo / a few legendaries if I’m overflowing!
---
If you are on xbox i can give you a carry
---
If a purpose server swap happens then yeah I would say it's griefing (unless they meet in the future by chance) but on the same server session. Both parties agreed to pvp.
---
It was with the blood eagles in the mine, not these evil robots... These bastards are rough lol
---
I see a lot of posts saying stealth doesn't work for people. On my main (commando, non PA) I run sneak 3 escape artist and have a fixer, and I notice I'm in caution a lot more. 
---
But I'm rarely in "danger" despite going into caution a lot more frequently now. 
---
If going for PA heavy, who cares what you wear under xd. Totally up to you!
---
like ^ said....then scrap em for mods!
---
Did you pissed off Todd? Oof
---
Thank you for the offer, but sadly I'm on PS4
---
Gatling gun or .50 cal MG are the most ammo effective, due to .50 cals and 5mms having the best material to ammo conversion, so I would go with either as far as ammo concerned. 
---
Gauss minigun or minigun are better if you don't mind farming the ammo for them.
---
Two shot Explosive miniguns are fun.
---
man i just lost a ton of weapons trying to transfer in my private server because my game froze at the main screen. I feel your pain...I love this game 😐
---
People are not very bright. This event isn't going away, they basically throwing away legacies for no reason. The outfits will only diminish in value lol.
---
Lmao.
---
Thats true. As long as I can still wear a hat on top of it similar to outfits and armor.
---
I don't have the plan
---
Get a magic shotgun, or get a tesla rifle, as both are super broken rn
---
You may have to get used to another style of game play. Move out of your comfort zone. I'm not saying you gotta join the hyper optimised meta power gamer crowd... But be ready to change things up.
---
Stealth, power attacks and blocking, crippling things, drugs, new weapons and armor, power armor, teams. Try new tactics, new weapons. Experiment.
---
Really dig around your perks menu and look for ways to boost your overall damage, instead of boosting a weapon type. I'm set up for heavy guns to fight bosses but I use auto and single shot rifles for exploring the world. Most of my time is spent using rifles and I have a 3 perception. I use concentrated fire. Better damage boost than three points spent in rifleman or commando. The rest go into Gun Fu, adrenaline, bloody mess... Stuff like that.
---
Having a form of dogmeat that acts like old carrier/kuburow's from warframe would be great 
---
Gotta give bestest boy pets to get the loot
---
Been a stealth rifleman for the longest time can someone suggest something to replace sneaking perks?
---
Get the plan.
---
I get 200-250 shotgun shells and use like 100 maybe per run = maaaad gains heh
---
Yes, it is stupid how hard it is for second characters trying to get legendary perks is
---
bloodied stealth commando is tough now. but my bloodied PA guy is still quite functional. I think you're fine
---
Its so much fun 😅
---
Try loading into a different server. It does that to me sometimes but changing servers usually fixes it.
---
It's called working out
---
definetly wear a power armor.  get close to assultrons while circling around them and they switch to their melee weapons.  also shooting their legs out works. They flop to the grpund. Use medx and psycho.  Be on a public team. And troubleshooters gear can help.
---
It is a gas mask helmet. And a pricey one (1250?). But I bought it. Would be nice if we could mod it like the other armor helmets. Night vision, super perception, HUD  targeting, etc. It would be a real Secret Service helmet!! Also so cool paints would be nice...
---
Did you complete all 3 tiers the first time
---
It does it every day for me, wait a couple hours after reset and it works itself out.
---
It didn't help alas, only changing character!
---
Technically, you can get 3 plans a day. Each rank can unlock a plan. I always do it 3 times, one for each rank, so I have the best chance at getting them!
---
Cool thanks!  Guess theres no more incentive for me to run anymore then lol
---
man, I really hope they don't pull an EA and dip on their title like Bioware did to Mass Effect: Andromeda
---
Mad respect to gaming studios that revamp/reviv their game like Hello Games did with No Man's Sky
---
Here's to hoping BGS in invested in this franchise for a while longer
---
filter for this subreddit is also a joke, js.
---
What’s the challenge today?
---
I don’t think anyone ever had real official numbers, some people said double level, some people said a third, some people said the same or higher - just go see if you can grab something
---
No, I only got the paladin tier the first time, which weirdlery enough, got me the bos suit. I got elser the second time. I just thought you had one shot per day
---
Today I joined an Op team as the fourth person.  I waited about ten minutes with 0 activity from the other three, so I sparked off the Op hoping that we were all waiting on each other.  Nope.
---
I got 7:49 by myself.  At least I got to benefit from Taking One For The Team.
---
So far I’ve had much more success on my own.  90% of players run around aimlessly, run away from the uplinks to grab loot, or don’t even show up when they’re in an Op team.
---
They fixed that a couple updates back.
---
They don't have to be 1/3 of your level. They just need to be a random encounter and all by themselves!
---
Right, there should be a filter that says “airing salt please ignore”
---
The legendary perks were mainly placeholder ones that looked interesting. Good call for revenant, i has no idea that would work with eachother. Thank you very much for your input
---
I just got mine from the rare plans doing the daily op. I lucked out.
---
Double sucks that the actual weapon is no trade. So, great plan, if you play a melee character, If you are lucky enough to have that plan drop for that character. My hvy gunner, and pistol character both know how to make it, but will Never use it. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have even learned it, so it wouldn't show up in those character's legendary drops.
---
So should I intionally get a lower score on my 1st play though to maximize my rewards, since all 3 tiers have a chance of dropping rare plans?
---
Where can I find one?
---
Hell, I don’t read 90% of the posts here! There are so many of them it’s unreal.
---
Haha!
---
This is why when I trade I like to use the trade menu rather than dropping stuff on the ground. I do that to avoid the 1% chance of lost items.
---
If I'm not mistaken, you get the decon plan from scorched earth first try now if you haven't learned it yet. May be wrong on this though.
---
I'm really glad I gave up my stealth commando for a heavy weapons/power armor build. I wanted to play a grunt type soldier with automatic rifles that didn't stealth, but just couldn't do enough damage without eating a tonight of ammo, so I switched. It's kinda sad that there's really only a handful of viable playstyles. Way too much reliance on Bloodied/Stealth/Power Armor/VATS set ups.
---
Nah you have one shot of a roll on the completion of all 3 (5%,10%,80% or sumn like that) and infinite chances to try to achieve that time that day
---
Thank you! Yeah, I knew that the assaultrons had melee weapons, but I didn't realise you just had to get close to them for them to actually use the melees instead of the head laser.
---
The plan is buyable at the Harpers Ferry bot or the BoS Bot, try at local places and the Whitespring one's.
---
Yup, totally. Broadsider should do what a cannon really does: colassal impact damage. Hitting one enemy point blank, should not only obliterate them but also send everything around them flying. Broadsider should have massive stagger damage buff, impact should knock down all mobs in immediate area. Would love to see a cannonball punch a hole clear through a charred ghoul. Boom!
---
I just logged into that character again, still says complete!
---
Thank you, I really appreciate the time and effort you put into this.
---
Do you purposefully get lower times to maximize your rewards?
---
Blocker is also good if dealing with melee. 45% damage reduction is useful when swarmed by melee mobs.
---
Robots (i.e. army of Gutsies) with slowing weapons in the Vault.
---
Always trade via trade menu not drop them
---
His explanation is literally just "shoot at them until they're dead."
---
Anything that attacks in groups and jumps around. Mole rats, radscoripions, stingwings, and especially liberators.
---
I’m glad it’s not just my house!
---
How about the people that are at max budget getting the stuff in their stash bought through vendors and such? Stuff that was never ment to be sold? The countless hours spent farming or trading to get those items, id call that a little game breaking. Or the fact you can kill anyone not in passive right now with just a legendary card thats bugged? That ones minor, but can ruin someones play experience, or worse case scenario a lower level player loses all the junk theyve been farming from a pvp griefer? Gamebreaking to me is not just being halted in main story progress by a bug, but running into bugs that completely destroy your interest in the game.
---
But only if you dont get elder twice in a row?
---
I believe they are going to add perk load outs later, so I am going to hold off on that legendary perk for a bit to see how load outs work
---
Or just don't bother with any of it and farm teddy bears, good for the soul.
---
No worries :) on the legendary perk front - the fusion core recharging one will also give you health. You are basically assaultron proof :)
---
Read the post again :)
---
Lucky, I envy you😀 I only got some signs for the Burrows.
---
Yup! I make sure it is just my squad for this so randoms don't get upset. We personally love running the Ops, so It is fun to run it several times for max stuff!
---
No his description tells you to specifically target players on teams. So a pvp’er can literally identify you on a public team, find you on the map, fast travel to you, and try to kill you. If they can’t kill you they move on to the next public team player.
---
Then we have my level 2 weapons mule capable of breaking any lock and terminal in the game.
---
I'd say Tanderizer rank 2 is to expencive for what it offers. 
---
Tanderizer rank 1 offers you +5% bonus dmg. But Tanderezer rank 2...on +1%...do you really need that much that +6% bonus dmg ? I'm sure you can spend this special point somewhere else like in "Silencer" [Edit: "Suppressor"] that could potentialy save your ass multiple times.
---
And Ricochet isn't that bad, but on your build, that is absolutly not optimised to be a tank, it becomes a too random variable that will mostly never proc. If sometime it often procs, sometime it can just not proc at all. This is what made me put this thing to garbage. Too expencive, too ramdom...i'm definitly not in control of my defense.
---
I'd use "Grim Reaper's Sprint" instead. Everytime you kill something with your vats, you have a chance to completly refill your action points pool...and it often procs ! 
---
No, if you get elder tier, you get 3 different chances rolled at once.
---
If you are extremely lucky, you can get 3 rare rewards in one go.
---
I just got 2 today in a single run-- Caged light bulb and liquid courage recipe
---
.... 1500 hours playing and you just turned my world upside down.
---
I got 3 symptomatics wish I could sell spare
---
I also was on a full team 
---
Totally different experience than if your running solo
---
Each tier gives you a roll of a rare, each tier can only be got once a day, each tier can be attempted infinite times until you succeed it that day
---
this. I get tons of them. They are really good about getting all kinds of meats to cook.
---
nope, its random. I have thre characters that done scorched earth and only one had it after numerous times  
---
but yeah, probably better to use the trade menu I guess
---
Wait, Bethesda hasn't fixed the magic damage yet on fast firing weapons?
---
Yeah, just go into photomode and back out. None of this hopping server or quitting game stuff necessary.
---
Every weapon gets affected. It looked like I had a hard time just holding my mini gun, let alone fire the thing. 
---
I'd sooner face a vault full of cave crickets and stingwings than those robots from today!
---
Probably was the common name for drugs that are derivated from dung or fertilizer (like in third world country) and maybe we don't find It because all the junkies that know How to made It don't escape in time from Apalacchia
---
Thanks for the tip! I’ll definitely try that.
---
still should not be the workaround for something that should just work
---
Bloodied are fine, but as I said numerous times before EVERY THING got nerfed, so those that were hit the hardest were builds that already did less damage or were risky to play as!
---
Yep - I join do one and bounce. I’m not clogging up the team to be “that guy.”
---
BoS Bot? Where? Atlas Observatory?
---
okay johnnyboy
---
Harpers ferry bot is now at Berkeley springs train station.
---
You are doing more work than needed. You just need to finish as elder.
---
lol yeah head laser is no joke.  Im a full heath pa and can only take it for about 6 seconds.  The new legendary enerhy absoeber perk actually make it heal you which is awesome.
---
If you don’t have adrenaline max maybe put points into that if you wanna min/max a little better
---
Whitespring and Watoga of course?
---
You don't have to do this.
---
When you get elder tier on your first run of the day, it rolls the chance for the initiate, then the chance for paladin, then the chance for elder. So there's potential to get up to 3 in a single run.
---
That doesn't increase chances, whether you get all three at once or separate there's no difference for rare rewards what so ever.
---
I thought they need to be a lower level than you.
---
You can't sell fusion cores
---
That doesn't work. If you run Initiate you get 5% chance, if you run Paladin you get 10% chance and you roll Initiate. If you run Elder you get an 80% chance and roll all 3. Running them and getting lower times for perceived extra rolls literally doesn't work. Running Elder once is sufficient
---
Bro, do you even lift?😂
---
I don't really think the Ops are much work, so it doesn't matter for me and my squad.
---
Seems it's a thing in one of the updates over past year: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hqr9ul/how_many_sbq_kills_do_i_need_to_get_decon_arch_im/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
On two characters I've had it as a first drop. Either really lucky, or the comments in reddit posts like the one I've pasted are correct.
---
Really? Hmmm, I thought that your CAMP was safe now from other players. Apparently not.🤔🤨
---
Yes it slows everything down, even mutated jump height. Renders Plasmaflamethrower almost completely useless.
---
wait what, can you elaborate? If the card says the same as before what has changed?
---
I'm five coins short of being able to give you an award,I'm sorry little one.
---
Just shooting your gun can also help too. No idea why.
---
Sure, you can run it for fun as many times as you like. But you only need to finish it as elder to get all 3 rolls.
---
So this "so I have the best chance at getting them!" is pointless and wrong as you just do elder rank and get all 3 rolls. Doing every rank separately doesn't increase your chances.
---
That *is* impressive.
---
The way I'm reading it, is if you get elder on your 1st try, you get all the reawards. If you get a lower tier then a higher tier on your second play through, you have another chance at rare rewards. So I should intionally handicap myself on the first playthrough to maximize rewards? I'm sorry, I really did read it all, its just clear as mud after experiencing what I just did
---
I got lucky two days ago and got one plan for getting second tier and another for elder. But today when I did solo I got 830 so I got second tier and got nothing then did elder and got burrow signs. Yesterday got elder first try and got nothing. So you could also get 3 rewards in one day. But if you get elder and get nothing like I did yesterday then you don’t get anything until maybe the next day. So now I’ve gotten 3 vault 94 outfit plans, one liquid courage recipe, burrows signs, and someone was awesome and built symptomatic for me today.
---
The watoga shopping center in the northeast corner of the city has Vendor Bot Phoenix of the BOS and one of the “LOCAL VENDORS” bots at white springs resort
---
You get initiate roll, once. Paladin roll, once. Elder roll, once. After you get one of each roll for the day you're out of chances until tomorrow.
---
 Your first run gave you two rolls, initiate and paladin, of which you got one rare plan. Your second run you achieved elder giving you a third roll and landing you another rare plan. Now you're out of rolls for the day.
---
Working as intended. You got lucky and two of your rolls paid off.
---
Exactly, unless you have more than 10 points in perception already, youll get more use out of using legendary perception over infiltrator just on the flexibility alone
---
I wouldn’t necessarily say that. You still get legendary drops for every op completed. Not to mention the xp, stims, and huge amount of ammo you get.
---
And scrip. About a 1/3 chance of getting between 5-50 scrip from it.
---
Not sure on how good the source is, but apparently microsoft is throwing shade at publishers charging for next gen upgrades.  I guess we will see what happens with that
---
https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/next-gen-game-upgrades-should-be-free-xbox-tells-developers/
---
Yeah, I figured for that one. I don’t recall there even being a boost?
---
Its just.. frustrating.
---
I have a jffr shotgun, whats so good about it, is it magic?
---
I'm guessing that's an unlockable perk card? I don't really understand the legendary cards as of yet, but that does sound really useful.
---
Oh that's right, I saw the BOS territory marks at Watoga. Thanks!!
---
Nah new bug thanks to a certain legendary perk.
---
I think it's leaving a team in general. I was doing an op last night, in a team by myself so while I had a second I left the team mid op and was booted from the op.
---
XP boost for doing faulty ops (:
---
Edit: haha nice autocorrect. Daily*
---
I always qualify as a member for this club.
---
I skipped Bear Arms because I'm using Bandolier instead along with Batteries Included. The guns are heavy, but Bandoiler really helps with the weight of all those .50 cal rounds. The two big guns I have weigh ~38. 10,000 .50 cal rounds is 50 without the perk. I find I get a better investment with those 2 points than 3 in Bear Arms.
---
Dual wielding swords. Im sure you can port some of it from skyrim, but that would really make melee somewhat viable.
---
Thanks! At least it’s not melee kills only. I’ll take literally anything over that shit show. 😂
---
Physics simulation, not IK, that you are thinking of.
---
All magic damage still works
---
copy/paste from the link:
---
"**I'm still incredibly confused...**
---
No problem. Just start reading from the top of this post again and you'll get it eventually."
---
That's a bummer. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. 
---
The Daily Ops definitely feel like they're manually switched out. It feels completely random about when they change from one day to the next.
---
If not there, try the various faction trade bots in Whitespring. If none has it, try another day. Some plans rotate daily.
---
I think I know that perk. Dang...
---
Alright, double trouble with 2 big irons. Time to go to town on some legion wannabes
---
So if i get elder 1st time and fail amd get paladin 2nd tile I still get palidin rewards the second time. But if I get elder a second time I only get common rewards
---
Berserker should get 3x the damage
---
Same here,  as sneak doesn’t work I just spec for extra damage and damage mitigation.
---
In my experience those amazing vendor finds are two types of players. Those that just don't care and sell it to clean out their stash and those who just don't know what items are valuable.
---
There is a difference between repeatable and daily, even if both show up in the pipboy under daily tab in the quest log
---
I think you're quite lucky, in fact. I ran dozens of daily ops and I haven't received *any* Elder tier rewards despite finishing Elder rank with time to spare.
---
This. THHHHHIIIIISSSS. And the explosion feels so delayed like it waits for you to get close.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Todays was horrible. I really, really was glad to see that final assaultron.
---
Just throw them, it takes like two seconds and it’s a knockoff firework
---
I hear you on that. I'm so paranoid about this I once paid an official courier 10k caps and ammo to move one single item to an alt. Worth every penny. Had that gun since 2018.
---
Ok. Thought I read somewhere that they fixed it. Guess not. Guess that means my Furious FFR Gauss Minigun is still weaker because the damage actually caps properly unlike the magic modifiers. Lol.
---
My pip boy light was only pointing at my feet yesterday no matter what weapon I switched to, view I played in, and fast travel didn’t fix it. I haven’t logged on today so idk of relogging fixed it
---
its a legendary perk.  You have unlocked 2 levels of it being just over 100.  on  your perk card screen up top you will see legendary perk area.
---
You should be able to dual wield any one handed weapons without any Perks.
---
I have been playing for 3 weeks and I got really lucky to get in before things got so hard to kill. But still, I had lots of really nice players stop me in game and give me bullets without even asking. And my number one way of getting bullets for guns was to buy them at the saloon area vendors at the beginning of the game. Most are very cheap and give you a great deal.
---
You used to be able to get the plan at multiple train stations; Grafton, Lewisburg, Welch... probably others too
---
Less people selling weapons for insane amounts of real world money now ,so the latest dupe kind of fixed everything back to how it should have been,trade for trade.
---
Flamer works on players?
---
For the low low price of 1200 atoms!!!
---
For plastic, I just buy in bulk when I see at vendors. Or player vendors. Expensive but I prefer it to going places and hoping to find some.
---
I was using my stealth suit and hidden and a molerat still instantly teleports into danger and bites me from across the room when meanwhile the mirelurks and mirelurk king the next room over could never find me.
---
Fuck Molerats and fuck their stupid magical instant teleporting. They don't even hit hard it's just annoying.
---
You get a chance for every tier.
---
If you finish the initiate tier, you get a roll at a 5% chance to get a rare reward.
---
If you finish the paladin tier, you get a roll at a 10% chance an for the elder tier a rollt at 80%.
---
It makes no difference if you achieve all in one go or if you do it in 2 or 3 runs.
---
For every unlocked tier you get one roll at the corresponding chance.
---
If you finish at elder in the first try you get 3 rolls, one at each 5%, 10% and 80%. So if you are lucky you can get 3 rare rewards in one try. 
---
If you finishes the initiate, got your 5% roll there, and in in the next try you get the elder tier, you don't get the roll for initiate, but for paladin and elder you still get the 2 rolls.
---
So if i got elder 1st time I would've used all my rolls? This is what I'm getting at. I wouldve be SOL for the rest of the play throughs amd should handicap myself to maximize drop rates
---
It probably works like the score auto complete bug where it either fails to wipe the completed tag from the previous day, or auto completes it on login!
---
3000 rounds per Daily Op seems very excessive for only a few minutes.
---
Harpoon or shotties with limb damage are OP AS FUCK. I one shot lvl 100 super muties with my combat.
---
Berserker's was never good compared to bloodied. 
---
Wow you're a glass cannon, except instead of crazy amount of synergies turning you into the mary sue of Fallout, you get all kinds of anti synergies.
---
But hey, you can benefit of some of bloodied's and unyielding's synergies if you also get low health, but then what's the f-ing point of going berserker's in the first place?!
---
It's glass cannon, but just worse. Can't even be used in PA unlike bloodied. They need to change the requirement to be amount of broken armor or something instead of DR so they can at least get some kind of DR through perks, vanguard or bolstering, and then also possibly buff the damage. 
---
Only buffing damage will just be stupid, it's contesting with bloodied too much as it is. It will always either be worse or better if the mechanic itself isn't changed.
---
Can we also get a slide move ?
---
Mantle and climb ? 
---
Vaulting ? ( Seen this as a possibility with mods on fallout 4 )
---
Also go on intelligence team, eat cranberry relish, and get well rested, also there is a perk in charisma that gives you even more xp, and if you wear unyielding armor, XPPPPP
---
Oh so you guys been taking them all on me 😜 lol. 
---
I know where many are, they just ain’t been there lately.  Thanks for the replies, I’ll keep hunting
---
If you can see them. Some enemies are invisible!?
---
No. Get elder once and save yourself the time. Elder instantly rolls all chances.
---
If you do it one by one each tier you only waste time.
---
Enemy’s has Gatling laser but drops level 1 hatchet
---
Why give the player the option to play however they want when only certain "builds" even stand a chance now? People who don't spend hours studying character builds are pretty much boned.
---
Yah that’s true.  I’ve got a surplus of all of that right now though... been at max caps for a week now, tons of ammo already, stims, too many junk legendaries that I can’t scrip.  Maybe for the xp though...
---
So of you got paladin on your second play through, you'd have 2 chances of getting rare rewards, but if you got elder again you'd be SOL
---
If you get elder you get all three rolls at once... Meaning you could get three plans in one elder run if it's your first run of the day. Once you hit elder once all your rolls are gone for the day.
---
Not sure about microsoft but Sony did say that any digital version of  a game you own on PS4 will be playable on PS5. It may not have improved graphics are a complete refresh but older games should be able to go 60fps or better.
---
The signs are amazing for camp building though. Much better than this stupid suit
---
Lol actually yeah 😂😂 I could get down with a spider fang dagger in fallout!
---
Oh, okay! You're good. Honestly, as much as I use my power armor, that perk might be really helpful. I'll have to equip it at some point.
---
Well it ruins the bank account of people trying to sell weapons for hundreds of real world currencies.  The trading is pretty normal again now,people are trading/swapping items for items ,not money for items. So In a way it actually did good. Someone will probably be mad because I have an opinion lol
---
Thats what seem to be the issue with mine. 🤷‍♂️
---
I've got all those and using a vampire's handmade and get wrecked by those freezing robots, just lock up completely.
---
Technically no but it'd be money on the table.
---
Handicapping doesn't maximize drop chance just wastes more time...
---
They stack together for even more ammo.
---
I have fallout 4 and 76
---
Was possible in fallout 4. In fact you get a minigun in one of the first missions
---
Build link or it didn't happen.
---
Yepper
---
Okay yeah that’s the answer I needed...thank you!
---
SWARMIN' VERMIN! FML, pretty sure it's connected to the load bearing event.
---
Ok I'm understanding this more, but the question i still have is, if you get elser 1st time, if you get elder a second time do you get nothing but common? Would you only get a chance at rare rewards if you failed and got paladin level
---
you use power armor all the time?
---
I have adrenaline rank 1, not sure how I feel about putting another 4 points to not even double the bonus
---
Ah! Ty!
---
well i can make 30 2mm ec with no ammosmith 2 and 54 with ammosmith 2
---
so...........
---
There was litterally one post on Reddit about it and no one else has reported anything similar. The OG post didn't even provide evidence, and when asked for evidence he just said, my friend did it so how could I have a recording.
---
...no.
---
If you get initiate on your first run, you get a small chance at a rare reward. You can still get paladin and elder on your next try.
---
If you get paladin on your first run, you get a small chance at a rare reward, and then you get a second slightly better chance at a rare reward. So 2 chances, possibility of 2 rewards in one run. You can still get elder on your next try.
---
If you get elder on your first run, you get a small chance at a rare reward, then you get a second slightly better chance at a rare reward, and then you get a really good chance at a rare reward. So 3 chances, possibility of 3 rewards in one run. You can no longer get any chances at a rare reward for that day.
---
I don't think so, it just has reasonably high dps for a non-magic shotgun. The instigating pump action also used to be pretty good from stealth but now it can't really one-shot as consistently so I retired mine and went full-time power armor.
---
This is what I'm asking. You could handicap yourself and get 1 chance at low tier, 2 chances at paladin, and 3 at elser resultinh in 6 chances vs 3 of you fot elder 1st time
---
I may be wrong but isn't every perk passive? There are no perks you actively use like none that require a new button press like an active skill in an mmo.
---
I just want the cure machine! So far I have the box and the jumpsuit
---
if you're on xbone i can give you a decon shower plan
---
"Pistol packin' mama" a must have for any build
---
Not all the time, but whenever I have to do a big battle that I know I'm going to die a lot in, I'll equip it. So... I do use it a lot.
---
I use ammosmith 2 and super duper maxed out and the legendary maxed up. So much ammo and not much resources. I love it
---
Any common bloodied build will do. Just get yourself a troubleshooters (even 1*) armor set and vampires automatic rifle for robots (pref. exploding). Super mutants and blood eagles can be done easily with unyielding + vampires. Or if you really suck at the game you can get mutant slayers armor set for super mutants too. If you are stiiill failing, jump on a power armor with emergency protocols and hip fire with explosive vampires weapon (hip fire is to save cores).
---
You can only get Elder once a day.
---
IDK, it always seemed to be the same as the first to me, maybe the cap was just higher before?
---
I have done top rank every day, not seen one "rare" reward.......
---
Wouldn't completing each roll from the bottom up give 6 rolls? 1 for lowest, 2 for palidin, and 3 for elder
---
One of my alt gets it ever time it joins Scorched Earth, I have 12 of the plans. Not sure why i keep them...
---
when do you actually **need** to open a lock or hack something
---
Collect food cook it sell it, sell unneeded resources, find good legendaries that will sell
---
I've got no rewards at all in 2 attempt days so far. Might try for 3rd time lucky after the football tonight.
---
But rng?
---
Wow I actually didnt know about any of that, but it makes a bit more sense why we haven't seen them! I figured if bethesda could do it for elder scrolls then fallout shouldn't be a problem but thinking lore wise it would raise a couple of questions unless they just like, primarily lived underground or something. I appreciate that bit of knowledge though! I didnt know horses and stuff like that were extinct 😅😅
---
They're kinda shiny
---
Dual wield fist weapons too
---
But in all seriousness i doubt the creation engine can handle it
---
The only limited resource is stash space. If all mules are full, sell that shit and keep playing.
---
Its kind of pointless trying to level 2 characters to max out them perks , makes me sad
---
Or tasty squirrel bits
---
No, you don't you NEED A GOOD FKING BUILD
---
watch angryturtle yesterday video he is killing mobs with a fking pipe rifle with a supresor that he made.
---
you don't need godtier weapons to be effective.
---
Haha grenades goes brrrrr
---
We did a couple of ops and just never thought to change the team to casual or something for the rest of our play session.
---
No. You do not get 6 chances. You get one chance for each tier. It's up to you if you want to do them separately, running the ops three times or once as elder. You still end up with only 3 chances. 5%, 10% and 80%.
---
This is what im talkin about. I think this to me is what made the prior fallouts more fun to play cause you knew what you would get it you put in the effort. There are things i love about 76 but fo4 did it better. Maybe its just cause 76 is online and its harder to drop exactly what they have
---
What?... Your RNG is the same regardless. Elder gives you all three rolls; a 5%, a 10% and an 80% chance. I don't know how to explain it better to you. Good luck.
---
Trolls like attention or knowing that they cause pain and grief.
---
Unfortunately, you just made their day by posting this.
---
I guess what I'm saying, is with RNG, it's possible to get more rare rewards with going through the ranks vs spending all RNG on one rank. I know I must sound stupid, but in my mind it makes sense
---
No because you can only get each tier’s rare roll once a day
---
If you already did initiate it won’t roll it again when you beat paladin
---
If you’ve already done paladin it won’t do either when you do elder
---
Take a look at the other dozen posts. This is the definition of RNG. Some people get weird patterns because thousands of people are playing this every day and rolling the dice
---
Hop in some power armour, nerd rage and blocker work in power armour
---
&gt; This is part of the story. The other part is that some people legitimately aren't that good at gaming and maybe even just thinking.
---
Agreed. I'm constantly running into posts where people say they're unable to do anything as a low level yet my experience is the exact opposite with a build that isn't optimized in the slightest (no bonus damage perks, no bonus accuracy, range, etc perks, almost entirely quality of life perks) running around with a hunting rifle and light leather armor.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Lol of course I have imagination, If I was todd I wouldn't just plop them in and forget about them, west Virginia and bugs go hand in hand so I bet there's plenty that could be done with them considering events like campfire tales exist.
---
I have that energy absorption  maxed out and now assaultrons are my best friends. Actually everybody with a laser weapon is a friend.
---
That perk does not work with laser turrets in the silo
---
Damn the conversation has made me wanna play borderlands 3 really bad tho
---
Really,  I should look into building them then? Now I am curious. 🤔🙄
---
Ohhh I get it, I should buy skyrim again.. lol but thank you for posting the link. I think im just more than incredibly confused
---
Everything ok until you saw someone with double gauss pistol
---
Look on a trading sub.
---
&gt; step on millions of legos 
---
A fate worse than death...
---
You're not getting it though. If you progress through the ranks 1 at a time, you get 1 lottery ticket each try.
---
If you get elder in your first go, you get 3 lottery tickets at once.
---
It literally does not make any difference, RNG wise, whether you do them one at a time or if you just run elder.
---
Yes that’s why I said they were rare. Very few people experience these problems. Everyone I know family and friends that play this have not even run into stuff like that or things magically vanishing from your inventory.
---
The few that are affected are the vocal few that blows up to insane amount of attenchen. Which is fine imo so Beth knows about the glitch/Bug.
---
I myself have run into items being put in the vendor some stuff was sold but it really didn’t matter to me. I removed the vendors and items on sale and fixed it. ( I’ve lost 2 legacy items from that)
---
I’ve only ran into a few griefers and I’ve played since the game released. Like I said when we play games for 4 hours~ and some bug comes along that happens like t posing then we remember that detail a lot more and make a big issue out of it.
---
Having these problems known is a great way for Beth to know what’s wrong but to lie about things and say the games shit/ not worth your time is another matter
---
I play games to have fun and by far I’ve got my entire money worth and more from this.
---
So it works with the bots, but not the turrets. Got it. Thank you!
---
Yeah, this is my fear now. Ive said before, PP is my favourite event. Hardly anybody ever plays it sadly, yet Id happily do it solo.
---
I havent tried since the recent patch, but im guessing I wont have a fun time no longer.
---
orange mentats
---
The new theme that plays at Pleasant Valley/Top of the World is a bit of a remix of the Prydwen theme from Fallout 4, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Wait a sec...
---
lol.  okay  what chest mod do you have? I am leve 205 and I use excavator all the time.  The key is your chest piece mod.  I use kinetic dynamo.  With action boy/girl and dodgy.  Riochet helps too.  And blocker card. With kknetic dynamo any damage you take refills your ap. Dodgy will have your ap absorb 30 percent of your incoming damage and your kinetic dynamo chest piece and action girl refills your ap at the same time to make you super tanky.  There is very little difference between powers armors in actual practice.  Like 10 percent difference in damage taken in between excavator and t65 so just stick with excavator for extra carry weight.
---
If they had a bigger blast radius they might actually be useful
---
I dont think Bethesda ever expected the majority of players wanted a permanent base location, like they thought we would like the portability. If building wasnt so damn fidgety and buggy perhaps... but really naaaah.
---
Theres a few glitchy pieces. The atom shop skull mask clips badly through a prospectors hat. Kinda ruined my whole punch priest aesthetic.
---
Oh, I never used them, how silly of 😀🙄🙄me
---
Honest I know putting the code in make the animals fight instead of flee and hide I just wanted the back pack but it was dead in seconds. Think I managed to kill two enemies.
---
If they do, PM me. I'll give you plenty
---
Look like the Predator cloak!
---
Thats why i gave up on SS armor...its pretty much impossible to get good rolls on them
---
That called being a Gunzerker with a Grog Harold.
---
Shouldn't be 'booting' anyone from a Public Team in the first place...!
---
What do those chems actually do ?
---
Just could test right now this issue, I tested another report issue with concentrate fire too. This is my observations:
---
- non-auto rifles (rifleman): vats critical fill works fine always recharge when hit and concentrate fire increase 20% vats hit chance every consecutive hit
---
- auto rifles (commmando): vats crotical fill sometimes dont recharge meter even when I killed, not necessary just after critical shot. Concentrate fire seems to increase just arround 6% vats hit chance every consecutive hit!
---
Ps) tested with rank 3 concentrate fire
---
I dont know If it was intented to nerfs commando buildings only or just a bug. Please open a ticket and let us know whats come from Bethesda.
---
one of my weapons?
---
I have one weapon.
---
junkies gauss shotgun with limb damage and something else.
---
It would be possible if Bethesda invested in larger AWS instances with faster CPUs, more RAM and more bandwidth. However, these larger instances would also be way more costly to them, and in turn, to the players. What we have today is a trade-off between cost and performance that's generally acceptable to both players and the publisher.
---
Yeah, absolute junk. Any type of grenade is junk in this game and I always just straight up get rid of them.
---
Bethesda logic thinking we want all this useless crap that does literally nothing. Its the same with Missiles and Mini Nukes. Just trash.
---
did you try healing it?
---
4k 45 ammo can do tons of damage, what is your damage number on Earle? I thought he has something like 30k HP total?
---
And they can't have freezing and cloaking.  Cloaking isn't a problem
---
New untested perk allows this bug to come back.
---
Shame really as it takes bethesda atleast a month to fix these.
---
That's if they can
---
Are you sure it's not a problem with max 8 person instances
---
It might of been 2.5k but it hits headshots for 40 to 100 depending on adrenaline. 500 on reg spawn.
---
It could’ve been but I mean I saw the guys sitting there waiting to go down and then I look around and it’s me and two others
---
Right, but if you 3 chances at a rare roll regardless of the percentage, doesn't doing it from the ground up grant you mor le chances of you getting a rare reward even if the percentage each time isn't the same. Like if you have a 1% chamce of getting something rare 3 times vs a 90% chance at getting a rare item once, you could possibly get 3 rare items vs 1. I know elder give you the chance of rolling 3 rare items, but doing it separately give you 3 separate rng rolls vs one. I think I'm making this more complicated trying to min max
---
That looks horrifically beautiful, well done!
---
Sounds pretty good. Do you charge it every time? I remember having difficulty in FO4 charging it up and using it in vats.
---
I didn't get a chance, meet your friendly animals came up on screen wave one coming in. Kill two enemies turned round to see him at 15 percent health and dead. Was literally 20 to 30 seconds of wave one. Going to try again next one I see. See if heavy guns works better than my shot guns.
---
I am currently doing runs to tame creatures on my characters.As far as I can tell It is still the same as it was.As in the creature had to be half your level or below.Example for instance I had a tame option for anything I encountered at half my level or below.Creatures that were above that I could not.
---
Yeah I just figured that out too, always hated it in 4
---
How about recall based on proximity and not time
---
Bitch wtf it’s the same % every time chill it’s 5 10 80 no matter when you do it and it’s one shot each a day that’s it that’s a wrap clip clap skippety bap big boy thread is closed
---
Hold the fuck on. There are berserker users?
---
When you get elder on the first run, you unlock all 3 tiers, with that all 3 rolls for the different tiers. For every run after that you can't get any rare rewards, because you already unlocked all 3 tiers in the first run.
---
You still get all other stuff, like ammo, radaway, stimpacks etc.
---
Maybe... but i remember it being so bad with my .50 cal, maybe its because of me using a .50 cal though
---
I know people have been complaining but honestly a bloodied rifleman still does well.
---
Level 50 is the max weapon level, so I would start doing events that drop legendary weapons, and once you have a legendary weapon you really like, start getting the perks and mods to make it better
---
If you have someone around you during the boost the time you save (vs solo) more than makes up for the 3 seconds u lost, broham!
---
Because of duping and Beth making some weapons harder to get but mostly dupers fault.
---
I think the main issue with pistol is that the primary damage slot is agility which contains all the core dmg boosting skills aside from luck tree or tenderizer.
---
You have to basically go what, like 2 1 star guerilla, a 2 star guerilla, 3 modern renegade, 3 gunfu, 5 adrenaline. I forget but I think thats the optimal setup and it leaves many agility cards out of play. But otherwise you do considerably less damage.
---
So you lose out on durability, on damage from weapon design, from clip size, and from perk customability options. The benefits, low AP cost, ability to carry multiple options at a relatively low weight without perk investment... just don't stack up to what you lose. 
---
TL;DR - I think guerilla/gunslinger should be perception not agaility tbh. Thats the only real way to make them able to hit all the necessary perks, barely. Perception perks are garbo, agility is where the damage is.
---
Yes! Exactly why i think it should be universal.
---
Could not agree more... got the plans 3 days in a row now and have no use for the them, this must have been a massive oversight.
---
Um... I don't have one. I've never really thought about it until know. I guess that would be helpful. I'm definitely going to look into it.
---
I haven't gotten a single rare reward and I do it everyday...
---
The survival chem is awesome. It gives full food and water, cures disease and a bit of health. Never personally noticed the health part as I play a bloodied build and am always either at full health or dead.
---
So 3 Seprate rng attempts at once, vs 1 separate rng attempts per tier this is exactly what I was asking. I thought elder gave you 1 rng attempt at getting 3 rare rewards vs 3 separate attempts.
---
I am a stealth sniper build, and if my one experience with Daily Ops is an indicator, I'm screwed, and I won't try it again. I died more in 5m, than I have in the last 2 months. I was literally surrounded on all sides constantly, often with 5 or 6 robots attacking simultaneously. I couldn't even clear a room without having them spawn in around me. Used up 500 rounds of ammo, plus whatever I managed to loot off my kills, my main (anti-armor) rifle broke from use (without sneak multiplier everything took 10 hits to kill). Now, I read "you've got to adjust your build", which is easier said than done since "legendary perks" used up all of my "perk points". If I gain another 30 levels, I might have a build that can complete a "daily op". But a tight indoor setting, where the opponents can detect stealthy players, add in waves of opponents, spawning in from all sides, no thanks!
---
4th day in a row: 3 Vault 94 stash boxes plans and 1 for the lamps.. RNGesus where are you?
---
Lol. Just count your card ranks bro. I don't know how many you have left, I'm just telling you how many you're supposed to have. Didn't tell you to scrap anything. And for the record, you would only need to scrap 300 more perks to get the coins you need.
---
Submit a text post on r/fo76
---
I'm anti-reddit
---
Its called legendary for a reason
---
Very true, buddy.
---
“Waste a lot of junk because someone recked your shit”
---
This is what inwas getting at. Elder so 3 seperate rolls vs 1 roll. I thoughy doing all 3 would give you 3 rolls vs 1
---
My problem is that one of the dailies is always "Do a Daily Op" and the ones like today (Robots) just kick my ass solo. So I'm not bothering, which means I'm missing out on at least two dailies: that one, plus the Golden reward for doing 5 challenges.
---
And if anyone finds it aren't on a melee character, it's just a big waste!
---
i hardly ever charge it. I have started doing it more though. Usually for that first shot.
---
I see you, I love you
---
&gt;3 Seprate rng attempts at once, vs 3 separate rng attempts per tier
---
Exactly. No matter way you do it, you're getting 3 separate RNG rolls.
---
Whether you get all tiers at once or all tiers in separate runs, you are rolling the dice the same amount of times and have the same potential for rewards.
---
if it's your first time whats the hurry?
---
Doesnt work if they are in passive.
---
Ahh ok, I just saw that the casual team boosts intelligence. Does that also increase XP? That also clears up what the card sharing option is for. Thanks!
---
Why do you feel that you're being forced to switch to a bloodied build? Just because you're no longer one-shotting things that doesn't mean you're no longer viable. You can still do your support role just fine, and the dps builds are going to be as grateful for your service as ever.
---
And yeah, I do play a bloodied build, because I think it's fun and I like the play style, but I get it's not for everyone. Bloodied is still at the top of the food chain, that was never going to change. So don't feel bad, it's all good, just keep playing the way you like.
---
What other option is there?
---
Concentrated fire is 2/3/4% hit chance now, instead of the bugged 2/3/20% we had previously. The damage increase remains at 1/2/3%.
---
I've been testing this critical hit thing whole day. Not once have i gotten the recharge on the first shot (actual hit that did damage, not counting vats miss bug) after critical. Even after fast traveling to another location right after the critical. On new location, first shot would not recharge.
---
The latter. I clip through one of the many cliff faces near west Tek then go straight underground.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Get yourself a set of Trouble shooters armor, literally cake once you do that. I have a full set and can solo Encryptid with it. That and a Vampires Gun
---
Targeting HUD does not work consistently during Daily Ops and definitely not against invisible enemies.
---
May he receive only floater grenades!
---
For camps it's something else.
---
At level 6 it’s quite normal to be broke/poor.
---
Th-the what?! I mean haha yeah I totally knew that with my lvl 90 character and haven't been going into the core this whole time.
---
I've been wanting that backpack, too. I've done it a few times since this clusterfuck we're in currently. And it's absolutely insane. I've got three events 1 success and 2 failures. The success had 3 people 150+ players, the failures myself in one and my LVL 22 and another player in the other. 
---
Well, I'm really not sure that 1Wasteland is working properly, since my LVL 22 is constantly running into mobs that are 40 levels above, including in PP, I got mauled by a LVL 60 Wolf. 
---
The successful event I was in, there were so many LVL 100 Honeybeasts running around it was bonkers and nearly impossible to take them out with a powerfist. Not to mention the LVL 50 and above Bloodblugs and bloatflies. AND LVL 100 ANTS...wtf.
---
When I did the event alone, before I could normally collect around 40 Venison, well, this time I only got 25, and my Wolf was dead in just the first wave when a swarm of YaoGuai appeared. 
---
I like a challenge and all, but this shit is just not fun.
---
Try em all or look up builds
---
After some testing, it's apparently with all my shotguns.
---
I have a friend that can make me a legendary weapon but I have to be lvl 30 and I want the power suit
---
Did you.mean berry? Cos the berry mentors don't work against the daily ops enemies. I've heard so anyway.
---
It's so they have better control of the types of loot they give everyone that hits and loots, yall get your own custom roll of the loot, and not just for balance but for variety.
---
Psa berserker is useless.
---
Millions of legos between upright plugs
---
Helpful info!!
---
How do I try to get perks to make it better, isn’t it random?
---
How do I try to get the right mods, isn’t that also random?
---
Do I really only go for one weapon? Is the last word a good one? It just sucks up soo much ammo
---
Two shot if you’re not full bloodied. Check the damage when you swap to it, should be extremely similar plus two shot will keep the higher damage if you ever go full health for events or in the future
---
There shouldn’t be a feeling if a “grind” that early on. Just do the main quest lines and side quests too, you will level as you go. You will be level 50+ before you know it. You can also do some easy events and such if you really want.
---
&gt; berserker feels like it should be associated to str and or melee 
---
Swift berserker? Nimble berserker? AFAIK berserking implies armorless fighting style, but not lack of brains or a(A)gility. Beth can easily add some more perks like "gaining extra speed with all actions while at 0 armor" and put them into different Special parameter groups. Of course, some of them might aswell conflict each other's bonuses, even with down to nullifying.
---
Report them to betheseda they will get banned. .
---
It's not going to make you never going to have to repair it.  It would be op.  5% sounds fair.

Hey.

Some of us tank in our CSS.

Lunchboxes
---
They should just let us drop or sell them, I have no idea why we cant
---
May he only recieve pallde string ammo! Some people may use floater grenades in rare cases!
---
They aren't exactly the same.
---
I'm not your 'buddy', guy.
---
Most MMOs now days have an area looting system. WoW implemented their's 8 years ago but there were other MMOs before that which already had it. 
---
It really sucks that FO76 doesn't have one. It takes me longer to loot stuff than it does to kill stuff.
---
*edit: LPT use the "Transfer all" button to loot corpses with a lot of shit really fast. I press R R on PC to do this and it helps tremendously.
---
Do you know to get the back pack you have to put the code in to shut down the robots. Sorry if you know this, You just can't get it other wise and you wont get a notification either you just have to try craft one.
---
Interesting, I thought it might just have something to do with the way the gatling gun fires.
---
Yes fire damage only unfortunately.
---
This doesnt need to be changed though because the addition of legendary perk cards allows for this extra creativeness in builds already.
---
You had better luck than I did.
---
While playing a game, with headphones on, I didn't hear the closed-loop liquid cooling unit fail completely.  Wound up cooking my CPU.  Completely dead .... and it was seven years old, so it was unlikely I could have just resurrected it with a new CPU.  (The only one was an AMD FX-8350, on an AMD3+ socket .... I don't even know if they make CPUs that fit that socket anymore ...)
---
So I had to shell out about $4K for a completely new computer.  It's a *serious* upgrade, mind, so I don't really regret the money.  (For example, my GPU went from a barely-cuts-it GTX 970, to a "wooo, this is effin' nice" RTX 2070S.)
---
Long story short: y'all got off **easy**.  :)  Celebrate that fact!!
---
Have you tried conecntrate fire with non-auto? For sure its add 20% with rank 3, I tested many times
---
Agreed. All the manual weapons shoot away too slow.  I'd like to see speeds similar to New Vegas' weapons, especially the revolvers.
---
Better that get stuck in your head than baby shar.. OH GOD DAMMIT
---
Thank you. I thought elder gave you 1 chance at getting 3 rewards not 3 separte attempts
---
Electric absorption?
---
Is that a bug? That's insane!
---
Full food full water diseadr cure and some hp. The important thing is you get one every half hour stacking up to 5
---
Yes!
---
Gauss rifle?
---
Praise be! I understand finally! under his eye
---
You don't have to escape, so loot away. Once the timer runs out you just get teleported to the entrance. The stuff in the chest isn't really worth leaving those sweet screws and Ammo behind.
---
I know the built War Glaive isn't, I thought the plans would be though
---
Which backpack is it?
---
Some areas have minimum levels for enemies. Some areas have maximum. Youre in an area with a minimum floor and the lowest it goes maybe 30~
---
Sorry forgot to add that on semi-auto it's 10/15/20%. And this has always been working as intended. On automatics they just forgot to change the semi-auto 20% into 4% after copy/pasting the numbers i think. That was the extend of the bug they fixed on patch 22.
---
This is true not sure why someone downvoted you
---
450% with both maxed.  250% with just ammo factory.  Your choice.
---
If the grenades stop then it seems likely that the posts complaining about them should stop too.
---
The blood eagle with a TSE Minigun pulls up...
---
Quite literally the only reason to buy the plans is for this notification to do one. 
---
Although knowing my luck I’ll get the one you get for atom shop items saying I know how to make it for later
---
Arktos pharma.
---
Pretty sure there are more planned for the future.
---
I lost somehow a Vampires Faster Fire Rate Faster Movement Speed while aiming Gatling Laser somehow, was just gone. I feel like it disappeared through the shop glitch. I paid 25k from someone for it too 😫
---
Yea felt the same. Its super packed
---
You can get power armour at lv 15. Legendary weapons can be found starting at lv 1 :)
---
Or you can just not bother picking any locks or hacking anything. All you get is random junk and scrap gear. Meh
---
They can also report this player for exploiting.
---
Make the gun more accurate please.  It's so hard to aim.
---
Not sure, I have heard that it's been confirmed as intended for when your fusion core is maxed but I can't confirm myself. I do know I've been using the same fusion core for 3 days tho :)
---
Or can we get the option to sell them? We can sell other grenades but not these ones.
---
Lunchboxes give you exp boost of 25% for each one for 1hr so if you have 4 and opened all 4 it would give you a 100% exp boost for 1hr.
---
See, I thought you got 1 attempt  at 3 rolls at elder vs 3, so doing it 3 seprate times would give you 3 attempts regardless of drop percentage
---
If it was an exploit.  If there's actual proof.
---
I’m not your guy, pal
---
I wish the floater grenades could be modded to fire from nade launchers
---
sorry. Shotgun
---
I think the new suit is ugly and would have just gave it to you.
---
I might need to try this
---
Exactly. Like, what makes them so damn special that they can’t be traded or sold.
---
Ah
---
Click on score board. They're rewards.
---
I like using them on settlers at random locations after I’ve milked them for rep. Simple things...
---
For sure but I did get 2 rare drops. Useless plans tho.
---
As far as I know everybody has his own quest progress. 
---
I'm not sure for the open world quest parts, but pretty sure for the instanced ones like the wayward. In these instances everybody has to do it in his own instance. When you enter the instance of your friend, you can't help in dialogues, only with enemies an such. 
---
After you leave, and your friend started his quest in his instance, you have to enter your own and start the quest for yourself. And like that for every quest part that is in an instance.
---
No. What you're experiencing is the intended way. Quests are always solo. You can't "help" each other in terms of npc outcomes. Just help with combat only.
---
Them and the valley galleria signs are great. Theyre just as rare as the suit, but the suit, in my opinion, looks dumb. Actually the signs might me uncommon vs rare, bit still theyre amazing for camp building
---
Glad I asked, that's a bummer
---
Ok thank you I thought I read people of any level could play with friends anywhere. A level 1 definitely couldn't go there
---
This explains it. Thank you. I was trying to big brain it, only to fail
---
All the games and RPGs I have ever played berserkers are crazed fighters of insane strength and durability ( attacking anything in sight ) Armor just makes them tanky or more agile depending on the gear. 
---
I have heard of armor less fighting but those are only usually the case when you have to ability to dodge and avoid damage. Armorless in this game is a problem due to the effects of legendary effects on pieces of gear.
---
I dunno, I didnt make the game or do their PR :/
---
They definitely *did* mention there will be floor and ceiling of levels in certain areas, so maybe a bit of a contradictory messaging from Bethesda..
---
Edit: at least now I know lower levels can still be carried! If you have a high lv friend you could tap lv 50 enemies and get tons of xp, while your friend kills em.
---
Ah ok. That makes more sense. Thanks!
---
Ah ok. That makes sense. Thank you!
---
What is flux and is the Spec ops suit worth anything? Been playing game this game for maybe 8 days now and I just got one.
---
Indeed if all these "ifs" end up to be truth.
---
This really annoys me and it shouldn't. Guess I can blame battle bot.
---
Today i've done it only in full team ,all day long ,it's seems they read the post :))))
---
Power Armor, Two Shot and Anti Armor weapons to me got the biggest jumps comparatively since bloodied and junkies and especially bloodied unarmed and other melee got hit hard. I’m trying to switch my junkies character to a full health, two shot, no addiction issue character. The damage is essentially the same for some reason on two shot explosive vs junkies explosive. But many junkies weapons are magic glitched so it’s still pretty good.
---
I mean, isn't camp destruction part of the game?
---
I have to be lvl 30 to craft it
---
My buddies wasn't working the other night
---
You can find them in the wild. 
---
This is also not correct, you can craft raider power armour at lv 15. You need the plan, which can be found most often in player vendors or by completing one of the raider quests, iirc.
---
Also, your friend most certainly *cannot craft* you a legendary weapon, regardless of what they say. Crafted legendary weapons are locked to one character. If you try to drop it, it will delete.
---
They may mean they have an unused lv 30 weapon waiting for you that they found in game.
---
You loot it from the Queen. It's not an event reward. So basically you need to pull enough damage on the Queen. The first time you'll get loots from her...you'll get the Decontamination Arc.
---
Just the tip? Okay, bend over.
---
Cabins north of the tea time event usual have 5 or 6 bloatflys
---
Seems like almost everything in the gold bullion store is player bound.
---
He's not your pal, friend.
---
Not a hunting rifle fan. That nasty recoil. I'm on PC anyhow.
---
Reeeeee ahhhhhh glub glub ooga booga [clicking noises] ffppprttptttt
---
Listen here stupid mother fucker. I thought you got 1 chance at 3 plans at elder and 1 chance per rank if you worked your way up from the bottom resulting in more chances at rng. Let your wife's boyfriend know ill be home soon.
---
Depends on your build and play style: you don’t get the extra little benefits of 5 pieces armor with 3 legendary slots and two mid slots each. But if you really lean hard into stealth it may be all you need.
---
It’s a random encounter
---
what would make this amazing would be to have the base XP amounts at 1 int, and a variable that players can edit to get the xp based on their actual int.  
---
Not everyone will have that insane 30 int you are running with so this spreadsheet displays vastly over inflated values for non bloodied players.
---
I don't think this would be too hard to figure out as int adds a static additional xp % per rank iirc, so you could likely deconstruct the values using the formula.  
---
Outside of that great work!
---
if it mentioned self destructing it's real. random encounter in the savage divide.
---
head south from lake eloise which is south of south mountain lookout and east of vault 96
---
+1 to this. Specifically, perk coins.
---
Courtesy of Nerfthesda.
---
I’ve been using nothing but the Chinese stealth armor since I got it. Enemies literally walk by me and if you have more stealth in your perks the better.
---
I did SQB yesterday for the first time and was completely protected. My only advice is if you’re going to try another armor make sure the stealth armor is NOT broken or else you will have to repair. If you don’t remove it you’re fine but minus the damage resist. Finding the fiber optics and ballistic fiber is a pain.
---
I got one today! Yes please on that 20% discount!
---
&gt;Armorless in this game is a problem due to the effects of legendary effects on pieces of gear.
---
Perhaps it's due time to present some kind of jewelry and/or tribal tattoos? Maybe some savage and gruesome wear like finger necklace, skull codpiece, et cetera? Players already have got severed Deathclaw's hand and bear's skull, why stop there?
---
&gt;All the games I have ever played
---
It's your own experience, not universal. Besides, "overall" berserker image does not oblige Beth to make it the same way.
---
My build atm is more catered to sniping so I suppose I might as well try it
---
I know your pain.. Stash,solar panel,stash,stash,none. Rng is a real bitch
---
When I hear the wind up noise, full book.
---
I don't think you should have been using a 7 year old PC to play a new game
---
This is the root of the problem. Caps aren’t good for much these days.
---
Granted I sell pretty much all my decent excess legendary gear for caps, simply because I have all the shit I need, minus a few marginal upgrades that would like but don’t go nuts seeking out. Then I usually just buy plans I don’t have or vendor hop for people selling fuel, missiles, 40mm, or nukes for dirt cheap.
---
RNGesus does not look favorably on booger eaters.
---
What would the 2nd 3rd and 4th ranks do?
---
You are a monster.
---
Bomb drop event
---
I bought some bulk fiber optics to build it so I might as well give it a go
---
At least somebody will be able to do some Damage...
---
I'd like to thank you for suggesting this. If I'd known it sooner, I might have been able to salvage one of the daily ops I'd abandoned.
---
Melee sneak attacks do +200% damage.
---
To put it more in line with the additive nature of it.
---
But in Fallout 4 you would be able to unlock a certain perk at let’s say level 10 but wouldn’t be able to level it up again until you reach a required level. For example I remember that master lock picking was unlocked at level 40 but you can unlock advanced lock picking at a much earlier level.
---
I’m guessing you can’t get mods for it
---
The ammo that drops per kill varies by ammo type and, significantly, not by weapon. So my heavy runs with a gatling and a minigun. If I use the gatling, I'll kill with about 5 shots and gain between 20 and 60 ammo per kill. I'm literally farming ammo.
---
What you kill the last boss with also changed what you get for the rewards ammo. So I swap to my gatling laser, use a half core, and get 2-4 cores back.
---
Both of these are great ways to get ultracite ammo. I am currently trying like hell to make prime receivers to take advantage, but I have not found anyone selling flux and have had no luck getting mob-drops from nuke zones to use with the flux.
---
I keep one on me as it’s handy to whip on in a nuke zone and weighs the same as a hazmat suit. No good in daily ops though
---
All grenades are useless in this game. The time it takes to throw one and for it to go off, the enemy has likely already moved and you could have done more damage just by shooting it. I’ve never heard of a build that utilizes grenades or weaves in grenades between attacks.
---
I was hoping it wasn't one but makes sense. Thank you.
---
shrugs .... today is actually the only times ive died ( due to not putting serendipity back on after making some ammo )
---
I got a legacy BE plasma for my suit which kinda proves your point. Unless you are trading high tier gear nobody cares which sucks ass

---
Ill have to take a look. Thanks!
---
Would it be too much to ask for you to search the sub Reddit to find this information yourself? Because this question has already been asked hundreds of times already.
---
I loved it in fallout 3 and from what I can tell it hasn’t been nerfed for this game. It’s the same as in that fallout so I’m happy. 
---
If you make a new one every 5/10 levels I just scrap my old one for parts with the perk cards I have for scrapping also.
---
It would be interesting to note any sudden shifts in difficulty when crossing level boundaries (like 5, 10, 15, etc). 
---
I finally leveled up to 50 this morning, and since I was focused on perk cards that affect ammo generation, and Super Duper became available at 50, I used that instead of another Rifleman card. With no other changes to the build, armor, or guns, I got my first 1-shot headshot (level 50 Ghoul in Camp Venture) since the update came out, so some kind of shift occurred. On the other hand all the ghouls at the Charleston DMV switched over to the level 62 Charred Feral Ghouls, and were substantially more difficult. 
---
All the Super Mutants in West Tek switched to Enforcers, but by that time I had rebuilt my weapons to Level 50, and was wearing Ultracite armor. I got cornered in a small hallway with 4 Enforcers and a 2 star Legendary, but survived that. It felt good enough to go farm Ultracite in the Glass Cave.
---
 Coupled with Ammo Factory as a legendary perk, crossing over Level 50 was a pretty massive shift in the enjoyment level.
---
Tighter spread increase mag size by +5 each rank.
---
That would make the main story a little too easy, if cranberry bog was level 1.
---
No they wont its part of the game, a stupid part, but its still a part of it.
---
As someone else said...  *it was a joke.*
---
I’m talking about the Reddit poster, not whomever took this screenshot for attention, you sad, desperate little man.
---
So, these are OKAY ways to get caps. 
---
Sure fire way to get ¢1,400 in 10 min a day or less: make Marine Helmets and sell them to the vendors.. they are made with rubber, plastic, and glass.  
---
Farm rubber at grafton HS, plastic at the cat-lady house, glass everywhere.  
---
As for plans, drop site C2 or AMS Testing Site... I had to check time for a month to get them
---
Guess what I have for sale now though? 😁
---
I'm a stealth sniper as well and I don't feel as punished. My Gauss rifle went from 998 to 638 damage so I can still one shot most stuff,  just have to charge the weapon. Although I feel bad for lever action, hunting rifle and semi auto users. 
---
Energy weapons however have improved vastly because their armor penetration has been fixed so laser rifle, plasma rifles and other energy damage based guns are worth looking into. I advice a plasma gun over a handmade for [DANGER] and a handmade over plasma for [CAUTION] situations. 
---
Heavy gunner for the most part gained more than it lost because of the new Legendary perks and the fixing of armor penetration for energy guns (plasma caster, gatling plasma , gatling laser) although Legacy weapons are still very powerful and broken 
---
Unfortunately,  the biggest problem comes from Hacked and  Magic weapons or weapons that do more damage than intended and stil nothing has been done to them.
---
Thanks for the info, sorry for sounding salty, just got my ass handed to me by those freezing robots, then realized my stupid dumb ass had forgot to put my full trouble shooter set of armour, was still wearing my unyielding.
---
I was confused why I was melting so fast. Thanks for being a good sport 👍😎
---
No, it's not a national holiday. We do have a few weird federal holidays, but average workers rarely get them off.
---
It should just stop being a drop!
---
Seriously I just chuck these things as it's faster than dropping them
---
Nope. I max tier’d yesterday’s op with the blood eagles and invisibility, but not today’s robots in vault 94. The pip on the map says (earlier) that all of the tiers were “incomplete”, so I played it, got the middle tier in the playthrough, but on the summary screen it said I had already unlocked all three. Maybe it’s confused by yesterday’s unlocks which means another pretty big bug. OR, rewards and untethered to the tiers showing as unlocked.
---
You’re welcome , it obviously will take a few more grendades becuase of one waste land now , but I knew that have an aoe when they explode so knowing Bethesda sorta put two and two together and there you go
---
I’ve not played any of the daily ops yet tbh, think I need to improve my guns first
---
took orange and thought it helped, but I get confused with all the shooting and explosions
---
I know my view is not universal. I was just making a suggestion that could solve the problem of berserkers effect. The unarmored is pretty bad due to legendary effects. 
---
But if they would increase the damage like someone here already mentioned that’s more then bloodied like 150%~ it would be much better for the current berserker users since they have to take more risk due to being armorless.
---
In the end it’s all up to Beth how they want to handle legendaries in the future and more input from the player base is welcome for them.
---
Best combo is sizzling style with a dense mod on your chest armour.
---
No unfortunately it’s a stand alone piece. You can’t equip other armor on it either, but you really won’t need it. If you’re a sniper I assume you’re shooting from a distance and therefore have a low risk of enemies running for you.
---
I forgot to put on my party best trouble shooters armor set, I feel pretty silly right about now 😁
---
Yes, those melee arm mods are very bad.
---
I’ve got it at level 50 anyway so I’m guessing it doesn’t level up anymore after that
---
It exceeded minimum specs. ::shrug::
---
Also, I never said it was a **new** game I was playing.  Point of fact, it was a game from 1992.  :D
---
Besides, the AIO cooler would have died just the same if I had been *reading Facebook*, except I might have heard the pump fail and known to shut down before irreparable damage happened.  Unless, you know, I was listening to music, or a video ..... with my headphones.
---
I never do the NW challenges. Everytime I decide I'll give NW a chance I get killed by somebody camping in some obscene spot, it's never fun lol
---
I stopped using mine, it just too difficult trying to figure out the best way to shoot it. First person, no third person, in vats,  out of vats, pres, release and press vats again, lol. I just want to shoot and an endgame gun should be better then this.
---
Mr. Looty
---
Yeah and when they get close I just use the fixer on them and that usually deals with them
---
Another annoying aspect of their burrowing is that they can burrow into the ground and then magically burrow out of the floor of your wire mesh platform that is floating four stories up in the air, then end up knocking you off of it.
---
Must be a pretty huge tip 👀

---
Great! Are you on ps4?  If so i can give you a vampires heavy weapon for the missle silo.  You wont need stimpaks lol.  I use a vampire minigun for  daily ops and my health never gets below 75 percent and I come out with 30 plus stimpaks.   A good video to watch to is Angry turtles full health pa build.  I copied it and eventually tweaked it for me but its a great baseline to hardly every die.
---
Also, make sure you have hard bargain equipped and pop a grape mentant
---
How about pistols get +5% dmg and one handed gets +10% dmg each level but only if they are equipped together. No PA.
---
Make it pirate themed.
---
Whip out my T51b and my gatling laser...I'm your huckleberry
---
Sorry to disappoint you, but Beth is not listening.
---
Your points were brought up during the PTS-time, with the results you saw.
---
Further more, there are only 3 official "managers" active on this sub, they have yet to say something other than "we tell the devs". But who knows...
---
Maybe u/ladydevann or u/valseek have some words for players that are negatively affected by this, and maybe they know why the camp-defenses were forgotten when scaling everything up.
---
In that case do you think i should drop power user to reallocate those points elsewhere?
---
True, but in FO4 you didn't have cards that could be swapped out at any time.
---
Maybe they could rebuild the perk card system and only allow you to level up each card at certain character levels... but that's a pretty big overhaul, so I wouldn't count on it.
---
Well I do not not know what is popular at this exact moment but I have always seen a good amount of PA rifleman toons running around.To answer the other part of your question the answer is yes.The new update to the game pushes towards having to run specific builds with specific weapon types to get by.
---
Why do I have a feeling that ‘something shady’ shouldn’t be posted here at all?
---
Why should I keep people who doesn't share perks in my teams?
---
That makes more sense then, I have puzzled over people farming it when I get so little ammo back, and with vampires I never thought about stimpaks either.
---
iirc if you don't escape nothing happens to you other than missing out on the chest at the end of the mine and two first aid boxes
---
Thats called greifing they can be banned for it.
---
Perk sucks, get something useful like serendipity.  Repairing is not a big deal.
---
Truly, the most useless grenade in the game.
---
I've only gotten three rare plans and it's been the war glaive Everytime. I don't even use melee.  Good ol RNG.
---
Did you get two legendries after finishing the op?
---
He talking about Frank Horrigan, an Enclave Secret Agent...a cyborg.

Not saying I doubt this one iota, but personally I don't think I've ever had that particular bug.  How common is it really?

Free lead, bro

I am on PS4! I just hopped off because there wasn't much else for me to do event and quest wise
---
No ps4 haha
---
Just use fireproof. For w, rank 1 of fireproof halves the explosive damage of cars and the 6 damage it does do isn’t noticeable enough to upgrade it anymore. Don’t waste a legendary perk slot on sizzling style
---
What did he do? Get you to shoot him back?
---
Because that’s a petty thing to ruin someone else’s run over. I don’t share perks because I chose to forgo my charisma value in favors of an all out melee/explosives tank, should I be kicked just because I can’t share Master Slugger with you?
---
np, we all have those moments.
---
Last Word is decent but yeah it eats ammo lol, are you a power armor user? If so then yeah heavy weapons may be the way to go 
---
You can craft a lot of ammo by grabbing the ammosmith perks under agility, and the super duper perk under luck
---
I highly reccomend getting the super duper perk maxed out for any kind of crafting, it really comes in handy 
---
I'm a little confused what you mean by mods and perks being random?
---
You can unlock mods by scrapping the weapon or armor you want to learn the mods for at a workbench. If you know how to craft that weapon, you can craft multiple low level versions of that weapon, just for the sake of scrapping them 
---
Whenever you craft a weapon, it comes with a full clip of ammo for that weapon too, so crafting and scrapping tons of heavy machine guns may get you ammo for your Last Word if you decide to main it
---
As for perks, I'm not sure what you mean by random either
---
You don't have access to picking certain perks right off the bat, but after level 50 you should have them all unlocked and able to be chosen whenever you level up
---
Legendary Weapons are actually random drops, fortunately though in the most recent update, while the game has gotten harder, the drop rate of max level legendary weapons has never been better! If you decide to try and grab a different legendary weapons than your Last word, some good legendary effects that will pull their weight without you having to Min/Max are Anti-Armor, Junkies, Increased Firing Rate, and Furious 
---
Other legendary effects can be good too, but those are the easiest at the moment to get performing well for minimum perk investment, so you'll still probably have to change your build a bit, but not too bad 
---
I wouldn't bother with two-shot or explosive legendary weapon effects at the moment, as they will just break really fast and not deal much extra damage 
---
Do you know how to convert legendary weapons into scrip to try and get new legendaries? Also do you have a backpack yet?
---
Need to rebalance the rewards for some old events too.
---
I have a legacy beam split laser that breaks SO quickly. Just trying to make it viable.
---
Dang. I'll make a big post about it but I hope someone else does first lol
---
Gotta put a Fat Man to use somehow.
---
Damn I haven't had a reddit connection yet haha
---
ok  my psn is sinistmark.  Add me if you want.
---
Just let us trade blind items between alts already!
---
SS armour, gauss weapons, glaive plans, whatever. Give us a small account wide bank that we can use to move gear between alts!
---
r/inclusiveor
---
You can also get the plan from the prison event patrol duty.
---
Yeah agree all the events could do with a bit of a look at.
---
Notice its a private effort not meant to break anything, not to hurt anyone, and not to benefit in any way that could do anything above, thats why Im not trying to disclose any details lol I know how people in this game's underworld are. I just need a bit of a second eye in helping me with something is all.
---
My suggestion would be to focus on armor for daily ops. The important thing isn’t so much killing as much as possible as not dying while waiting close to uplink. If you’re full health a mix of autostim and revive and then some enemy specific pieces depending on what’s on the menu that day. A full set of troubleshooter armor will reduce every incoming attack by 75%. These uplink missions reward tanks. And on a team others can handle the enemy quickly if your weapon isn’t up to the challenge. You can add value by helping the uplink work faster
---
Daily ops are the best ways to guarentee legendary drops: 1-2 legendaries per 8 minutes (10 including load in and out time) is the fastest guarentee drop in game.
---
Legendary perks mirror regular perks, most of which no one uses so proportionally there is a higher percentage of useful legendary perks than regular perks, although I will agree some are trash.
---
Zones still matter: Forest caps at 50 and the cranberry bog has level 100, much different experience between those levels.
---
This patch made more legendary effects able to keep up- so yeah they are all similar but rolling an item that is not bloodied means you can still use it 
---
If they made the game static and the best build and items were achievable easily and never changed/rebalanced people (maybe other than you) would complain that they finished a mmo style game and will not play anymore- aka they cant please everyone so they keep pushing more content
---
Wastelanders was good but had bugs that took weeks to fix if they aren't still in the game
---
Earle got delayed forever and even after that patch was deemed a Collosial problem for weeks. Also dont forget this patch created an issue where you could not progress the main story and therefore could not start wastelanders quest line until patch 22
---
This patch went off with so few issues youd think BGS knew how to make a working patch for a game.
---
Yes. It's frustrating that the animals actually attack the alpha when you're attempting to get it. I guess it's really more out of reach now than it was.
---
Might mean a Fixer, but that’s craftable as a level 20 version.
---
Depends, if you use gatling laser or ultracite gatling laser, keep it in for 1k shots per fusion core. If you don't and use ballistic exclusively, go for it :)
---
TSE lever is the same way, nothing helped.
---
There’s a lot of things you don’t *need* to do in this game. But this game isn’t only about streamlining for combat.
---
Or if they did more damage or if you could vats grenades or if they didnt weigh so goddamned much. Any of these things would be an improvement.
---
Alrighty!
---
I understand what you’re looking for. However, this has the earmarks of some type of exploit. Therefore, it’s a subject not allowed in this subreddit. You may have better luck elsewhere.
---
with  **The Sword of a Thousand Truths**
---
I’ll look at sorting armour out for that then whilst I do main missions and that, thanks
---
5:50 with just me and one stranger.
---
You can join my game and I'll mod it.
---
Gt:shadyrebob
---
Think I have one in my stash I’d be willing to part with. You got a traveling leather coat or any other rare outfits or some awesome AA/bloodied melee? 
---
Been looking for a good bloodied compound bow with  vats stars.
---
Yeah if u destroy one persons base over and over sure. Base destruction is a part of the game.
---
I mean, the patch does seem to indicate to me that they aren't very concerned with mid-low level players.
---
Yeah, I am thinking about switching to a Gauss. I have an anti-armor handmade that still works pretty well but it sometimes takes up to 6 body shots to down a level 50 alpha wolf when I am not longer in sneak.
---
Hm thats a bummer, well alrighty then.
---
Legendary perk, “taking one for the team”, has the side effect that it will opt you in to pvp immediately - make sure you set pacifist if you plan on using it, or just skip that perk entirely til fixed.
---
If I'm the team leader you probably will
---
Done earl maybe 50 or more times, I've never seen this chest.
---
"The only thing objective about value is the price."

-Paladin Stavros
---
Best of luck.
---
Because I was searching for cases were a gas mask hazmat suit anything like that would look like after it was removed hence this i feel so bad for the man though
---
It's near the entrance.
---
SInce Berserkers probably used some kind of drugs like mushrooms,  why not  have herbivore play a bigger role with  berserker?  ,alot of damage output or DR when ingesting certain herbs? and more perkcards for every role  wouldnt hurt .  Also the berserkers should benefit more from light armor , Odins berserkers often had thick bearskin on them .

---
He’s not my friend, bro
---
But the article has nothing to do with Fallout 76. This subreddit is for topics directly related to the game.
---
If it has the potential to contain items or let you work on items, then the hotkey for Stimpaks (right on the D-pad for console, H for PC) just doesn't work until you're out of looting/interaction range. At least, that's true on console. And the thing is that this is true of enemies who are alive and can't yet be looted too.
---
You press the key and nothing happens. You press again and again and again as you're backing up and none of them count. Finally, when you've backed up enough to not be able to loot them if they were containers, then pressing it allows you to heal with a Stimpak. It just won't work close up. It's literally more reliable to put them on favourites and use them from there, letting the enemy hit you as you navigate that wheel.
---
I've been getting a lot of downvotes lately, regardless of comment. I don't really care either way, but thank you!
---
He moved from Harper’s Ferry. Wasn’t in the patch notes, though.
---
It’s been posted multiple times already, people looking for Vendor bot Wallace. He’s now moved there
---
Harper's ferry bot got moved to EDIT: Berkeley Spring Station
---
Ahhh, I gotcha. Explains why I missed it lol
---
I was looking for real cases to reference what they look like
---
Live enemies for me too. In fact, living beings of any kind, any container, and any workbench/shop.
---
3 ranks is pretty good
---
My apologies for the repost then. I somehow managed to miss all of them.
---
No, I missed the MMOs that are apparently not adding new enemies to new dungeons.
---
lol the thought of a level 100 Brahmin
---
Sorry I dont fully understand: 10/15/20 for semi and 2/3/4 for auto was original bonus for concetrate fire? Or both is suposed to be 2/3/4 and they didnt fix semi in patch 22?
---
I get half that problem. Never have multiple hit, but I do have to hammer the button while pulling away from enemies.
---
You gonna fuck my wife’s boyfriend? ::0
---
I just had to update my computer cuz it was behind on ipdates
---
Yeah, that doesn't actually work when an enemy is in your face. When you're playing ranged it's fine, but melee it doesn't happen.
---
I'll be honest, if it is tradable it's worth a good bit- it is the equivalent of the fixer for 2 handed melee. After hype dies down itll be worth similar to the fixer plan which isnt half bad
---
I know the hotkey, but it's not working with enemies in my face. Can you go close to an enemy (melee combat) and still do that, because I've never been able to?
---
Game ain't free, gotta remember that
---
Gotta respect the edit and not just deleting it
---
I'm more looking for a controllable workaround because the hotkey seems glitchy, but these are thoughts. Only ever found a level 15 autostim, though there is a perk.
---
You can, it can be touchy though. Stop pressing other buttons for a second to make it more reliable in my experience.
---
That's one of the very few downsides to 3rd pov
---
I hate the 4 minute wait on ACP so I usually just nuke SBQ now. Also no repair kits.
---
I, too, miss the old days of   **malaria**, **diphtheria**, **flu**, **typhoid**, **smallpox** and **leprosy. But seriously, I hear what your saying. That is, unfortunately, what happens when new content is released. Hell, some fools even try to sell 1 stimpack for 700 caps still.**
---
Ahh see I’ve always played ranged since beta.
---
Does it count as part of the game though if it is unintended and happens through an exploit? Doubt anyone will get banned from it but it's not an intended part of the game and anyone doing it knows it
---
I had the same problem a week or two ago. Try to download directX from the microsoft site and install it. Solved my problem
---
I run level 3 Traveling Pharmacy, level 2 Strong Back, level 2 Pack Rat, level 1 Bear Arms. That's 8 perk points dedicated to carry weight alone. I have other QOL perks - I run level 2 Butcher's Bounty, level 2 Good With Salt, level 1 Slow Metabolizer, level 5 Gunsmith, and level 2 (3 perk points) Party Boy - that's another 13 perk points that have nothing to do with combat. I'm sure I have more I just can't think of right now. I don't have a single ranked up damage perk, I'm only using level 1 damage cards, with maxed out armor pen perks. The only defense perk I have is Lone Wanderer. Of my four primary weapons, two are Mutant Slayer's which obviously only help with Super Mutants, the third is Assassin's which is useless because I never PVP, I just like it because it's a heavy that has the reduced weight effect. The fourth weapon is Vampire's, which does nothing for damage but does make me tanky while I'm using it. I'm Level 110 with three legendary perks: Ammo Factory at the first rank; Infiltrator which does nothing for combat; and Strength which does nothing for combat because I'm not melee - I'm an 11 Strength non-melee user BTW.
---
I'm having no trouble with the game right now. I've solo'd every daily op at Paladin Rank on the first try, and picked up more ammo than I used in the process. I probably roughly break even on stims in an op, which is fine because I use stims so infrequently that I sell 80% of my stims to the vendors.
---
I understand your motivation. But it’s not relevant to Fallout 76. 
---
Let me give you an example. 
---
The voice actress for The Overseer is Adrienne Barbeau. She has had an illustrious career in live-action acting as well. She was in The Cannonball Run in 1981, and her character was quite the looker. 
---
If I were to post a picture here of her in that role and say *‘Look, guys, this is probably what the Overseer looked like when she was younger!  She’s even wearing a skin-tight jumpsuit!’* that wouldn’t really be related to the game. 
---
Additionally, it comes across as if you’re making light of the unfortunate soul in the article. Just to say ‘*Hey, guys, this must be what Mole Miners look like for real!*’
---
It’s in poor taste, and it’s not directly relevant to Fallout 76.
---
they're gold bullion items sold by raiders
---
Wait... So is having all three maxed commando perk cards and tank killer even doing anything for me now?
---
Tried that too. Fully still and hammering the button to get it to work. Nothing happening until I back off some distance.
---
Starting to look like this is something just affecting me.
---
Sent!
---
Like its absolutely crap man the keys on fisher and fisher is always in the same room with lev you can talk to lev though the window and kill him but you still have to get the detonator. This triggers me beyond belief
---
Yeah, single shot rifles got destroyed. I didn't know the Gauss rifle was still viable tho.
---
But the problem with single shot rifles is that before they were really viable on v.a.t.s builds. Now a v.a.t.s. build with a single shot rifle...it just not working ! It takes you near an whole clip to kill something. Your action points are being completly smoked ! 
---
The time to kill compared to an autamatic rifle is absolutly rediculous.
---
Is there anything that isn’t?
---
A goddamn pitchfork. 😂
---
Honestly weighing up a fresh install versus just changing my play style. I have just picked up an auto grenade launcher that looks like super pretty.
---
All the bugs surrounding it seem to indicate that it isn't.
---
What kind of damage are you talking about here? Stealth still works as before. It does not work in daily ops.
---
I mean have you seen the new Assaultron with the double miniguns for arms?
---
maybe you should play the new content before speaking on it. You'd quickly realize what you said is wrong.
---
now your argument will be "Well its a boss so it doesn't count" or some stupid crap. I'm done reading whatever you have to say. Your replies will not be read.
---
Imma teach him a lesson ;)
---
I guess daily ops is the new hot stuff now...
---
I didn't enjoy it too much. You seem to have get the elder rank to get something useful. And because I am still in the need of flux and treasury notes, I will always join every Earle or SBQ event.
---
There is a notice that pops up when other players start one, you can def 2-man it
---
Yeah I have only the original daily quests active. None of the factions ones are on my pip boy.
---
Put on pacifist mode.
---
I'm pretty sure that the different tiers of enemies would not change with a lower INT. You wouldn't get as much XP, obviously, but high-tier enemies would still give more XP than lower-tier enemies.
---
Where is the power armor
---
The thing is why didn’t you just stash it at his or your base when you bought it? There is no need to fight anything.
---
If your talking about crashing and you getting reseted by like a couple of minutes then ya. It sucks. I’ve only experienced this when the servers crash though.
---
I started a new character and immediately gave them master infiltrator and hey were able to insta open and pick locks and terminals without the 6 needed cards... It is SO NICE.
---
(Does this mean I can just scrap the hacker and lock pick perk cards for coins then?)
---
I was thinking since my str cards are maxed i would try the energy heavies, but i havent found any to actually try it out yet.
---
Thank you so much for all of your help. People like you make this community so wonderful.
---
If you make the team, you’re essentially the team leader. So when you do quests, your teammates can help you by tagging along, killing enemies. Etc. But it’s YOUR quest. So besides getting rewarded with experience and ammo and supplies here and there, that’s all your team gets. 
---
So go put it as simple as possible. Your friends/team can definitely help you from start to finish with your quests. But it doesn’t complete the quest for them as well. 
---
So all the missions they just helped you do, are missions they will have to do as well. (Assuming they are also new players and haven’t done those missions before)
---
Very nice work. Do the wendigos at ACP give the same XP as normal wendigos? Also, do glowing or scorched versions of enemies give the same XP as normal versions?
---
It’s already been posted multiple times
---
I'd like some arms that are able to hold all the melee weapons that are not usable in power armor.
---
Berserker's melee here. I've been doing alright, but that might just be the bonuses from legendary perks and that my chest piece finally broke so I've got 0 DR and full buffs again.
---
Remember: anything that reduces by percentages instead of buffing DR is your best friend.
---
When they called the perk "Taking one For the Team", they really meant it ;)
---
My problem is it keeps wanting to redownload the whole game again...completely ignoring the folder I have
---
For some reason I thought you might miss out on the otherwise guaranteed 3* random item.
---
Ole full stash lol its ok I have caps ill buy more lol just hella annoying
---
Search for:
---
DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer
---
Using the search function helps everyone. 
---
In this case, ‘Berkeley Station’ yields this information posted recently a few times. 
---
Good on you for wanting to share, but searching before posting is even better.
---
Yeah idk what to tell you. I have trouble sometimes too but seizing all other inputs usually works for me. Maybe the button is going out or is pushed in on your controller. Try a different one and see if it helps.
---
If you use a bloatfly syringe and your high lvl it always spawns lvl 100 flys which is kinda neat
---
I know I have an Arktos one but I thought it was from the Atomic Shop. I will have to check!!
---
My only hope is that OP reflects on this 10 years from now when they finally have some perspective on life.
---
Fair point, I'll make sure to do so in the future.
---
Yeah its kinda weird you cant use a power fist in a power armor..
---
Between this and Daily Ops I guess I should stop considering super mutant damage perks useless
---
If they friggin got rid of the caps limit they would make caps a legit currency. Because it is limited there still needs to be realistic equivalent to match for trades because of rng being so strict. 
---
Don’t make things less special or less rare but give us an in game currency that can match the prices you fluctuate everything to because of rarity you set everything to Bethesda.
---
I run a heavy explosive build and use the mirv grenade all the time. The demolition perk gives a bonus on all mirv secondary explosion. I can easily kill level 100 supermuntants with one grenade. I do think that the floater grenades suck though.
---
Then do us all a favor and don’t be team leader. If you can’t do well without three other people propping you up then you don’t deserve to be team leader and I feel bad for whoever is unfortunate enough to match with you.
---
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  
---
ffs
---
i would have cried ngl
---
Any time :) knowledge shared is knowledge used. If you're on ps4 I think I have a spare junkies ffr gatling laser. Though honestly, for walking around, try and get yourself a vampires :) 1k vamp shots and you don't die.
---
Also another benefit for the lasers - ammo factory maxed out gives you 9 ultracite fusion cores for the price of 2 cores and 1 flux. I made 7, procced super duper twice and basically have 100k shots :)
---
Hopefully. It does have that ‘young and awkward’ feel to it. We’ve all made errors in judgment, and this one isn’t catastrophic by any means.
---
Here you go bud. This doesn’t count superduper.  
---
https://imgur.com/a/vWrXZ8d
---
you know there is a pacifist  option in the settings right?  so you cant be killed or be available for pvp that easy. so if you dont have it on ,turn it on it will help you alot.
---
You caved. I deleted that shit before season 1 knowing full well if I didn't I be in the same boat as all of you. I'd rather drag my face on the pavement that is DayZ than submit to a battlepass or season system. Fuck that.
---
nah, you get a legendary for completing the event as well. i usually tell everyone else to run ahead of me so i can take the spawn aggro and loot all the screws
---
Yeah today’s the first time I died to daily ops I was especially surprised because I have electrical absorption and I usually never even go below 10% against robots but I was just getting gang banged by me gutsy’s and rolly polly protectrons
---
So basically just go after the many super mutant bases around the map for leveling then?
---
(Me and my buddy did this last night for my low level character, went from level 20 to 30 in an hour or so of playing.)
---
Safe travels. Thanks for being someone trying to help others. Your heart is in the right place. Don’t let some curmudgeonly old guy dissuade you from helping.
---
You can't trade them.
---
Yeah you either have to move the camp. or if it is on a floor you have to remove the floor and it puts the turret stored in builder.
---
Ah I understand. Sometimes it’s better to have someplace to vent your frustrations.
---
Increase bash damage by 200%
---
Tried that, still wanted to reinstall. Wiped extraneous keys, and folder. Deleted game. Restarted and just gonna check back in 2 days to see if the game works again. Thanks for the help anyways guys.
---
I just go to and click repair all
---
That's the one legendary card I'll probably never use. The only time I ever picked locks or hacked was for quests.
---
You can easily build a pc for 500 or less that can run Fallout 4. It’s not a super hard game to run. If you want to run it on max and everything then yes you probably will have to spend 800+ dollars, but just to run it on low to medium settings you will be fine with a entry level pc for around 400-500 dollars.
---
Bethesda should have buffed the rewards. If we're supposed to dump more ammo into things than those things should provide us with slightly better loot.
---
Ran the Imposter twice. Both times I got a White Fedora. I've murdered that fucking bot god knows how many times and I never got the Fixer plan. Fuck this event.
---
Ran Earle twice. 1 Cursed Shovel and some garbage tier armor. The only thing that currently saves the event from going on my shitlist is that the Wendigos drop the ammo I use to murder them. Not a complete write off, yet.
---
Ran the silos and the queen three times. Silo rewards were never good to begin with but I'm getting seriously annoyed with those damned missiles you get for each run. The queen gave me: 
---
1\* Nocturnal Rolling Pin (the meme must live on)
---
1\* Exterminator Pitchfork
---
1\* Bloodied Handmade
---
2\* Troubleshooter Wood Armor
---
1\* Trapper Chest Piece
---
2\* Mutant Slayer Chest Piece
---
6 UC plans, the bog standard shit plans everyone gets most of the time.
---
The only reason I still bother with the queen are the adds she spawns, those are giving decent XP now and are no longer a nuisance only.
---
In short, Bethesda needs to take a long hard look at the event rewards and the drop chances for decent stuff, otherwise they'll become less and less frequent because people get fed up and do other things instead.
---
Yup. lol it would be hilarious if we would’ve beat Earle. But we didn’t but he sure went in swinging his pitchfork
---
I mean perks that are in use but don't take up space in your SPECIAL stats. Stuff you have to swap all the time like lock pick, hacker, super duper, gunsmith, armorer, white knight, weapons artisan, etc. Stuff you only use while crafting, or lock picking/hacking. There's absolutely no need to make them take up space in your perks once you learn them. Master infiltrator fixed ONE of those issues but requires you to fill a legendary slot for it. And a shit ton of perk coins if you want it to be completely useful.
---
Scaling kinda kills the max.  The min still applies though as long as no high level walks through first.  
---
I don't think I've seen anything higher than 50 in the forest... But still, that will cream a newbie.
---
You keep not sharing perks I'll keep doing whatever the fuck I want
---
Much more intense.
---
This happened to me just this week - twice. I had to scrap a bunch of things to put down a replacement turret and then that one disappeared and I had to scrap even more. Luckily this last turret hasn't disappeared. Sorry, I know this isn't helpful but you aren't alone dealing with this.
---
I think I found the car you’re talking about. It’s spawns a magazine stealth by and outfit every fourth time? No under armor yet, but if that’s the one I’ll keep trying.
---
A floor of single square legos.
---
God I wish. That’s the only thing I really want. My melee build is crying out for it but nothing ever drops! ;-;
---
Not at all.  I've done my dumb shit too.  Empathy goes a long way though.
---
Do you mean the train car just below where the bus ones are lined up?
---
Plasma flamer counts as a semi auto rifle for dmg perks regardless of grip
---
Idk I have a non-legendary flaming bow as a backup and it takes 2-3 shots to take down anything less tanky than a yao guai 
---
Doesn't seem too bad to me, I don't even use any bow perks
---
TBF it was nocturnal
---
Exactly
---
When it triggers it negates the damage completely and reflects only a small bit, is that correct?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
True. And I think maybe that was the initial intent but the poor judgment was ‘let’s make this about Fallout 76 and post it on the subreddit’. 
---
So maybe it’s a ‘good heart, bad idea’ thing.
---
What platform are you on?
---
This combined with all my season ranks that keep unlocking is very annoying to just open my map
---
TBH the fixer plan to me is worth about 2.5-3K and that's only because once you learn it you can start getting drops for it..  The problem is other people think it's worth 10-15k to me, because that's what it is worth to them.  
---
The War Glaive plan is worthless to me as I never use melee, but as a collection-ist having 1 plan to learn is all  I need, same with all the rest of the plans really.  I'd rather make a few caps on it in my vendor to some lucky sod who gets there first, than trade with it to someone who wants to artificially push the price up.  
---
If Bethesda want to break the market on price gouging, they should make the plan's one use only, and non tradeable.
---
&gt; Well yeah. This patch crushed build diversity down to a few small pools.
---
So the same amount of meta builds as before?
---
^(~~zing~~)
---
Junkies does exactly the same +50% damage, but doesn't sacrifice nearly as much.  Not that it matters much now, Anti-armor is just a better prefix for damage than either Junkies or Berserker.
---
Funny you mention that as I've always wanted to try DayZ but it seemed kinda iffy...
---
Are you sure you dont want to be asked ?
---
  [   _] yes        [   _] no
---
You ALWAYS get a reward as long as you complete it. So even if it took you 1 hour. You’ll still get your basic event reward. 
---
However. There are 3 different challenges you can try to beat it under. 
---
Initiate. Paladin. And elder. 
---
If you beat it under initiate you get a small chance to get a rare reward. 
---
If you beat it under paladin you get a medium chance for a rare plan. 
---
And if you beat it under elder you have the highest chance for a rare reward. 
---
So technically you have 3 chances each day to get a rare reward. 
---
Keep in mind, if you played it for the first time and you immediately won and got elder, it will give you the other 2 rewards as well. So if you beat it under elder, you also get the rewards for paladin and initiate. 
---
Some people are lucky and get 3 rare rewards at once. Some people only get one. Or sometimes you’re very unlucky like me and not get a single rare plan.
---
Each 1 int is 2% xp, so at 1 int you get 102% base xp (which is odd) and at 30 you get 160%. Quick math should get you where you need to go up or down
---
Yep! That pretty much sums it up. It also works against the scorchbeast sonic attack funnily enough
---
It had character and now it has none
---
I would gladly give you one of mine for free. It really seems like that's all that drops. The only other drop I have gotten was a Vault 94 jumpsuit and that was with my 3rd war glaive.
---
Yeah it doesn't make sense that it can't be traded, sold or dropped
---
I just had my camp get nuked for the first time and I was not ready for that shit lol
---
Yeah me too. I was so sure I'd not do Season 2 and now I'm hanging out for the next weeks challenges to hit....
---
tbh im glad that this happens sometimes. means i get to move my camp for free occasionally.
---
Same with the fireman/firebreathers/Responders firemen uniform, hard to use any other helmets with them because they don’t cover the neck and it looks weird.
---
Agreed 🙂
---
This bug since patch 7, lol
---
Where do you get this?
---
I'm sorry your daily ops hasn't benefitted you any. 
---
Just voicing concerns here.
---
Yes. You get no Rare Plans for repeats.
---
Nope... well not that I saw anyway
---
Yeah but I'm too used to auto opening doors that it's just a habit to go up to it and open it
---
The bethesda launcher should detect files, that are already installed and not download them again. Check if the install path is correct.
---
I never tried it with the bethesda launcher but the support says it should work.
---
If you have enough space on your hdd you could copy, not move, the files to a different folder an try to reinstall it.
---
If that doesn't work you can try to uninstall it, then copy the backup files back in place and start a complete new install with the old files present. Or you could try to install it at another file path.
---
It can be, that it shows a download of the full size but scans the folder and skips the files that are present.
---
If you get Elder rank the first time, there is 3 rolls at a chance of getting a rare item. Thats the simplest way to explain it. However you could get nothing at all. It's all RNG.
---
Yeah this sucks. Was playing with my buddy and he got the plans and was happy to give them to me as he is a ranged sneak character and I am a strength tank but we quickly found out that he couldn't. Doesn't really make sense when almost everything else in the Ops are tradeable.
---
Oh yeah I finished Season 1 with a week to spare so it's not a desperation thing here. It's more that I wasn't gonna play too much more than every other day kinda thing. But still these challenges are done in like 30mins.
---
Maybe don't make shit up to start crap.
---
Awww thank you!
---
Yeah, that isn't true.
---
Que?? Always suggests the gun shop one for me. Never seen the marker anywhere else.
---
Thank you. I didnt understand that you'd get 3 separate rng attempts at a rare reward at elder. I thought you got 1 attempt at 3 rewards vs 3 attempts at a rare reward if you completed the previous tiers in order. 1:3 if you get my drift
---
We've got two controllers, and it's the same on both with different accounts. Didn't cross my mind this could be a bad install until now. Gonna try to reinstall overnight and see if that helps.
---
If not, I'm turning into another boring heavy gun user because the game won't let me play my way.

Zachy what platform are u?
---
I didn’t get elder the first time I did it today, do I still have a chance to get a rare item today?
---
Message sent
---
This wasn’t me, but last nite I found myself loaded down with almost one hundred plans. (Christmas came early, wink wink) and I found a level thirty-ish player and went to his camp. Tried to drop them, but he fast traveled away. Added him as a friend, he came back and grabbed them all. Boy was he happy. Gave him 1k of 5.56 and I was on my way. You hear a lot about the negative/griefing but not as much about the positive stuff. Stay safe out there.
---
ty, I'd copy/paste and add that in myself but op hasn't set it to allow sharing at all.  No worries though.
---
I go to a cliff and chuck them
---
Hmmm....I used to be a heavy farm build and sold royal jelly, all the cranberry food items and pizza rolls.  Since I moved my camp and switched collection stations(I went commie...caps for crap)....I haven’t been scooping up cranberries or selling any food items really. I’m guessing that was like 3-4 months ago? It stacked then....I used to make the cow run at least 3x a week with that stack.  Does anyone know of stack effects were affected by the new update?
---
Pick a speciality. I’d recommend rifles and focus in on the combat perks.
---
That's how I found out. I was willing to trade it for my buddy's Caged Lights. Lo and behold it didn't show up for trade.
---
Hey Tokes, would you be willing to sell me the suit? I will buy it from your vendor.
---
Xbox, why?
---
I run four leaf, but your math powers have convinced me to test this for myself 👍
---
Appreciate you man!
---
I do agree, I'm getting on OK with my vampire's version, but the VATS missing makes it hard to love it.
---
I couldn’t agree more, the first thing I noticed was the uncovered neck when I got the set today, can’t believe they didn’t connect the pieces like the ranger set.
---
Each rank has a chance, a roll, with elder being the best chance to get something.
---
I’ll take them.  Or buy them!
---
Archer was always obsolete. I had big hopes, grabbed all the perk cards. Got a three star legendary bow....... and it was terrible. Dps is a joke, aiming is really bad. Total lost opportunity. Sad.
---
Ohhh okay so I got the middle time, so I can still get rewards today for elder and the slowest time right? Appreciate you bro
---
And the new event reward thing, not clear on which ones. Got a suppressor bear arm from sbq.
---
&gt;2. The 2 bottom-tier turrets defending my base are no longer strong enough to impact the adversaries since they have increased in rank to level 50
---
Have you tried removing them and replacing them? The 1st tier turrets I put in workshops kill attackers too quickly for me. I don't get the exp from them and I am finding myself not placing as many as before.
---
&gt;6. Bunnies in the Forest near my base used to be level 1, now they're level 5. They do not attack, nor did they before the One Wasteland upgrade.
---
These are considered critters, and won't attack.
---
One Wasteland is the foundation of a rebalance, starting with all enemies being releveled based on you. You will see those enemies as level 50, but a level 5 will see them as level 5 (unless its in a higher leveled area).
---
Do throwing Arc and blast radius perk work with these? I would figure they do, and that makes me curious to try, but I can't at the moment.
---
I get nuffin every time.
---
That's brutal.
---
I shamefully admit I didn't know squat about magic damage... Guess that's what I get for mostly playing alone and avoiding meta-build discussions until recently. Gotta read up on that some more... I just figured limb damage would be rather useful so I kept scrounging for that as a secondary effect. Thanks for the Info 👍
---
I have two characters bloodied stealth commando. One with a bloodied ffr lvc fixer and one with a bloodied explosive lvc. I hardly noticed a difference, not dying. Only killing.....
---
Sorry, but when you said you were a fairy new player I pictured you as Link from Zelda running around the forest with his fairy guide. 😂
---
Well if you got the middle one, you got that one and the lowest. So technically you only have 1 more chance with Elder.
---
Haha, I was not prepared for that tank of an Assultron... I was actually doing rather well up until that point.
---
If you are part melee build and got the twisted  muscles mutation, it greatly reduces accuracy; you need classfreak to offset it.
---
Strength + stabilized will help wield those heavies.
---
Check your range/accuracy numbers at a workbench.  Better sights help. Be aware some mods that increase damage will decrease range and/or accuracy.
---
Thank you bro that makes sense for sure 💪
---
Meanwhile I haven’t gotten a rare or uncommon reward last 4 ops despite finishing at 6 minutes.
---
(Two days, two characters, 4 different daily ops at elder rank, and no rare rewards. Considering how big the rare reward list is and to not get anything from it when I can only do this once a day? This is some old bullsh*t.)
---
Thank you everyone, your answers are much appreciated and insightful 💓
---
Correct but my suggestion would make it so players can figure out exact xp values for their int. 
---
Come to think of it you could add a field for additional xp bonus so players could add the total bonus from double xp weekend, well rested, food buffs, etc.
---
Not a big deal, just an idea to make it more useful.  It's still a great guide for figuring out what enemies to grind.
---
Laughs in two pieces of troubleshooter’s armour 🥳
---
All you are saying is working as intended. Mobs that spawn near you should be around your level. That's what the update is about. Most people complaining are the power creeps. They used to one shot everything and make fun the game was too easy. Now they two shot everything and complain. Thats how mmos are. People are never happy with what they get. Bloodied are still the strongest, junkies still solid, melees are stronger, pistols are just a little better and bows and crossbows got hit hard. I play all of these builds and overall the update was a 8/10 for me.
---
Man, that's super unlucky. I guess we all have our complaints about it.
---
Really? It works for me as before thats really all I can say. Are you undetected when attacking? Ofc using a silenced weapon etc? All cards equipped? If yes then its sadly a bug then. This game have many of those :(
---
I don’t know how people do it without vampire’s weapons—that’s the only way I was able to power through all of them today lol
---
Hahahaha. Yes. Melee is typical beth but theres vats (jumpy, teleporty, lock on melee) and no shields or magic on your offhand.
---
If you like stealth, I'd suggest stealth auto rifles. Semi auto rifles are (or can be) tough for a newer player or even some veteran players since latest patch.
---
It always slows down when they add new content. It will pick back up again. Personally I've have those events pop in off like crazy on the servers I've been playing.
---
Just got done testing a few in stealth commando.  Furious +10% fixer is doing crap vs ghoul slayer fixer +limb damage against super mutants.  The latter seems to be on par to my mutant slayer handmade +10%.  Going to try an AAE +30vats combat rifle next.
---
I don't know what your "typical Bethesda" comment is supposed to mean, but are use a ranged sneak build and it works pretty good.
---
If it’s on a roof or floor or something delete the item it is on and it will be in your storage. It’s annoying but if you keep your turrets on buildings you are good to go
---
They need to be removed completely I don't think anyone will care about thier disappearance
---
Seriously. They're so annoying.
---
Heavy weapons with power armor. Only drawback is finding fusion cores and an actual suit of power armor.
---
I made it through to the boss without dying, felt really smug up until that point... that Assaultron was an absolute tank!
---
The wedigo fight is honestly really boring imo.
---
Well they nerfed the buff so I don't see why they can't buff the nerf, the thing is that where going to run into problems if they nerf the nerf and buff the buff.
---
They can condense it into a Lvl 5 perk, spread it across 1-40
---
I'm on Xbox but thank you :)
---
Other cool shite to do, plus the damage nerf is making those events much less fun to do. 
---
(My 220 damage per bullet on Earl went to 72, it takes so much ammo to kill him now even with a group of 4 that ACP just isn’t worth doing anymore. Glad I grinded out that event enough to get all the rewards before One Wasteland...)
---
You can buy the plan and craft a lot of them.  Then scrap them. 
---
I’d you don’t have the plans you can always ask a few friends to craft them for you. 
---
Obviously be kind enough to give them materials or caps on return. Or you can always just ask a friend to add the suppressor to your weapon.
---
im assuming blood sacrifice does this? would like to know so i can avoid accidentally triggering it since i power around with tesla mods on my PA and wouldnt wanna melt a camp as i walk into it to find the vendor
---
Damn guess I gotta start making blueprints then 🙃
---
I'll bet right now we don't get 12 decks in the official version.
---
Well you can get 3 rate items only, 80 for elder, 10 for Paladin and 5 for the other rank, this roll is only one per day, so two days ago i received 3 rate items, yesterday 0 and today 1.
---
You would think they would have fixed it by now lol
---
I will trade you a schrute buck for some stanley nickels
---
I run a full hp vanguard build, with a vampire magic shotgun, sitting at 720 DR you just cannot die
---
No it’s a guaranteed drop on her the first time
---
I know all of that already.  I already use stabilized, rifled barrel, etc.  But the plasma balls go everywhere.
---
I hope they step on millions of LEGO’s, stumble around, trip into a wall of LEGOs and reach for the door made of LEGOs only to find a LEGO cannon loaded with 1000 single piece LEGOs
---
No, they can't.  Is a month so bad?
---
How long did it take you?
---
This set droped From daily ops
---
But i traded some stuffs last day to get them
---
How shanty are we talking here?
---
im level 460 on my primary and just started out a new  ,im lvl12 on that one and i  reached flatwoods at lvl 6 , it feels like ppl are in a hurry and it punish them way harder now ,i have somewhat plenty of ammo for several guns because i pick up the the scrounger perk and pharma farma among the first ones and level them up ,hoard material and craft ammo and use melee alot until i start getting a bulk of ammo , then i started moving away further from the vault surroundings  .
---
so its alot harder now but actually fun .its  nice to get back to your main after a while thou  .  I think perhaps lvl 1-50 servers might be a thing and then when hitting 50 you move over to one wasteland or something like that.
---
It's a wheely good reward
---
Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.
---
I'm sure you'll find some appearing in vendors soon enough. Maybe all of them in vendors before 25 days is even up. 
---
Just about every character in the game has an 80%+ chance to get a plan a day. For me, that's four 80% rolls per day.
---
My unarmed melee build took a massive hit.
---
I've soloed every daily op in less than 8 minutes first try.  I don't think they're too bad.
---
that surprising. when i throw them almost nothing happens
---
&gt;and anything harder should be harder
---
You say that, but a Commando or Heavy Gunner, using exactly the same number of perk cards, will mow down Super Mutants and solo bigger game trivially while you/we plink away. Don't so easily accept being gimped because you want to a perfectly viable build that has been neglected my friend. Scorched, Ghouls, and Blood Eagles might as well be made of paper and really shouldn't be a benchmark for the viability of a weapon.
---
They asked what I use. I told them.
---
And changing the grip does make a difference.
---
they aren’t going anywhere, why do you need to have it now? Plus they are tradable so you can buy from others
---
I've found that by waiting a couple of seconds in VATS before firing has greatly reduced the chance of this happening.
---
https://youtu.be/Dt_5l9U4uhc
---
Oh yeah?
---
Yeah there’s like nothing I want to scrap to get that budget back. And the turrets were always going to be the first to go to free up budget if I ever found something nice in the Atomic shop. Guess that’s not happening. Time to rebuild :(
---
How did he destroy your camp? As far as I know, as long as you have pacifist turned on, you can’t start a fight with another player, and they can’t harm your camp either. 
---
The exception being you had a bounty on your head, or you had pacifist off and you guys decided to fight at your camp.
---
This is known ... I'd still like to see a bit more time. No reason to make it so rushed - this is a key different with this and Daily Ops.
---
All but the war Glaive anyway
---
Just be careful if you are rampant Activator. Was in someones camp and realized too late that one of their doors was locked. Hit E, auto unlocked.. Wanted.
---
It’s a brave new world baby. Gonna take a hell of a lot of ammo from here out. The pisser is you ain’t getting shit for the kill
---
Thats a shame,  mean its not a holiday here either, but you guys celebrate it a lot more to the point it would be worth making it a holiday
---
I run a full health PA heavy build.  I have two legacy weapons and a non legacy Tse 50 cal.  I can add some buffs and chems to increase damage.  I’m not out to one shot anything, I keep it simple so it’s less to maintain.
---
Yeah there’s 9 “rare” rewards and 5 “Uncommon” rewards that can show up under the rare reward thing at the end, so we should at least get *something* there at the end. There’s absolutely zero reason that reward thing at the end should say none.
---
Plans sometime in lvl 3 safes. 
---
But yeah, not really needed.
---
I only have one point in charisma and can't share.
---
Lore-wise there is 0 good reason for a ghoul not to be able to kill you, they could at the whitespring so why not flatwoods, i get that it is a bit jarring but you're having this problem because you were used to things being a certain way, while i feel the game should have launched like this, i quite like that the world is dangerous again.
---
idk plasma and orbital cannon grenades are pretty epic. Plasma Grenades seem to have added poison damage cuz whenever i get hit by a plasma grenade i get the initial blast plus a steady hp drain afterwards.
---
Melee is fine, players are just upset cause it used to be op and now it's in "just" line with other builds.
---
With the right gear and build you will kill most enemies in 1-3 hits.
---
Yup.
---
Although I do wonder if having 6 levels of lock pick (3 legendary, 3 regular) makes the sweet spot huge.
---
Yes if your on controller select a differnt special and use r1 and r2 to scroll through perks this will add it the prk u select for example if I select chrisma and scroll over to strength I'll get a point of chrisma and the strength perk card I selected.
---
Think this should make sense
---
I only learned from watching angry turtle on YouTube, he has a couple videos about the magic weapons. He helped me so much with my heavy gunner build.
---
I don’t really understand why they decided to make this a player bound item.
---
Yes, but you can only use 15 points worth of perk cards.
---
Directly opposite the tinkers work bench on your way out. When you zone in its just on your left behind an inaccessible door
---
Yes. Every time you level up, until level 51, you get to raise a SPECIAL by 1, **AND** select a perk card from *ANY* category, as long as you meet the level requirements. 
---
So if you want to buy another Strength perk during that time, simply increase a different SPECIAL by 1 then at the perk card selection screen, change the category. Look at the control options under the cards. You could increase Intelligence by 1, then scroll over to Strength and choose one of those cards. 
---
At level 51+, you can either move a SPECIAL point from one to another (still minimum 1 and maximum of 15) **OR** select a perk card from any category.
---
You will only be able to equip a total rank value of cards equal to or less than that SPECIAL as shown in the perk card screen, however.
---
Unfortunately I had them straight up on the actual ground right outside my camp. Thought it looked better that way the way my camp is setup. Really regretting that right now. Wish I would have known about this sooner
---
😀😄🤣😅🤔😶😑😐🤨🙁☹😦😧😨😰😱😭😭😡🤬👿🤬👿🤬 the full series of emotions when this happened...to me...with my BE15rl flamer I had renamed....
---
Math is base + 80% x 2.5 (if ammo factory is maxed out) so take 50 cal rounds 100 base +80 x 2.5 and you get 450 rounds. Without ammo smith it would be base x 2.5 so 250 rounds.   
---
So yes it is most beneficial to have ammo smith and ammo factory on when crafting ammo. It is also great to get 9 ultracite plasma cores.
---
Id rather not getting them in the first place
---
I would fully support this.
---
Yes. Eventually. 
---
After you hit level 50, every time you level up you will have the option of picking a new perk card *or* moving a SPECIAL point.
---
However, if you've put 15 points into a stat before you reach 50, then No. You can't get any more until level 51.
---
FO76 makes you kinda hafta pre-plan your build. Don't just dump points into a stat, make sure you need that perk.
---
Was it like a one day exclusive or is it a random drop that can be earned anytime?
---
You really need to go play the whole series before 76. You’ll appreciate it more
---
Oh I meant a regular grenade
---
go to your camp object and press repair?
---
It sure feels good helping out the low levels. Saw a level 16 building a camp right outside of pleasant Valley Station, decided to  build them a fusion generator and a PA station for free just out of boredom. He wouldn't stop emoting hearts and thumbs up. Glad to be the "helper" after having been on the other side of that type of interaction a few times.
---
Ahh. Im sorry then all we can do is wait for a fix :(
---
I agree with you. It feels like the Berserker class has been forsaken entirely at this point, when it merely felt like an 'afterthought' before Patch 22.
---
I was  hoping that Legendary Perks such as 'Funky Duds' and 'Sizzling Style' would apply to the Berserker class and would make it more viable w/o raising DR... Nope. Armor is required for these perks to work :/
---
I'm not quite ready to give up and delete my Berserker toon yet, as I'm still hoping that Bethesda will address the issue at some point in the future, but for the time being, I'm only playing with my Bloodied characters.
---
I just toss them over my porch into a fissure pit each day to see if anything new crawls out. So far I've just killed an insult bot
---
While I can't speak for others, I already have fifteen points in Perception to accommodate the NINE I have to devote to getting bonus damage.  Since Legendary cards don't allow for more cards beyond fifteen, they don't actually do anything to allow me to use more Perception based cards.
---
Where as reducing the perk card/point load to say, two (10% and 20%) per card rather than the existing three (10%, 15% and 20%) would free up three points which would (well, might) actually be useful.
---
This new patch changed a lot of things.    
---
Regardless, ammo isn't as plentiful until much later regarding some perks, drops, etc.    
---
My main is a stealth sniper and I'm really good at this playstyle. However, there are a lot of factors. Sniper/Hunting rifles have a slow rate of fire. There are other rifles that fire faster but a smaller caliber bullet = less damage.    
---
Melee sucks for the most part b/c most enemies have a ranged and physical attack.    
---
In Fallout, there is no right/wrong way to play. In 76 if you don't have an idea of how you want to play then that char is going go have a lot more obstacles and will be far less effective.    
---
1. Use the Nukes and Dragons site pinned at the top of this sub. After you make a build, near the bottom is a Level by Level Perk list with an arrow. Click on that. Save it somehow and follow it.    
---
2. You cannot bank perks. New perks only show up when you spend points on your SPECIAL.    
---
3. You can choose a SPECIAL to spend points in but choose a perk in another SPECIAL. At the bottom is the option to cycle through Perk cards. For the most part, I add a point and then a perk in the same SPECIAL b/c I know from the build list.    
---
4. I'm on PC and often help newer players. A lot of the time a high level player will look at their Pipboy or have you follow them to their CAMP. They are trying to help (most of the time). Everyone was just out of the Vault Level 2. If you have patience, learn, and progress you'll get to a higher level.
---
Let me rephrase; haven’t played 76 lol. I’ve played up through 4
---
Make the black powder pistol range/melee. After you fire your shot you flip the pistol around and melee with the butt end unless you manually reload. They could even make melee perks work with it.
---
Sounds like you’re just chatting pure shit 🤣🙈
---
The weapon you’re using is a two handed weapon. So you need to have the slugger perks on. Not gladiator. Keep in mind for maximum melee damage you want your strength to be 15. Plus the extra strength points you get for your underarmor. (If you upgrade certain underarmor clothing, they provide bonuses to a few stats, you obviously want plus strength if you’re looking for melee damage)
---
Try to get a set of unyielding armor. If you aren’t familiar with what that is, it’s a legendary effect you can get on armor pieces. The lower your health is, the better the bonuses you get. 
---
Each piece gives you plus 3 on all your stats except endurance. So that’s an extra 15 strength you can potentially have. Meaning more melee damage. 
---
Also, (I might be wrong here) but I think that specific weapon you have, can be obtained with a legendary effect from the purveyor. You obviously want a bloodied version of it so it does the most damage. I don’t have the plan or weapon myself so I’m not too sure on this part.
---
Oh okay thanks man! I just got the liquid courage so I guess I’ll just do my daily’s now!
---
Your skills and char are better than mine.  
---
I'm slightly disabled (military) and my hands aren't as good with some thing. It was my first try so only a limited experience on them so far.
---
What's " Silencer"
---
I believe between 12 and 13 minutes.
---
But when are they actually useful? When every mob is easier to kill with my gun?
---
pms welcome
---
Well get two for free. The rest of the slots you unlock with atoms.
---
Edit: I have no official knowledge. Just messing around.
---
You need to vats to proc that glitch.
---
As someone who as has a bloodied commando its alr and I played my other melle build and   melee after the patch is alr but with the  scaling patch  unarmed inst as good and so is heavy so for melee in my opion u need to use one handed medium wepons as the rest take so much time to kill so In order of usefulness-
---
One handed medium 
---
2 handed slow
---
Unarmed 
---
1 handed fast
---
This is how i lost my hunters long coat :(
---
That’s a lot of legos....
---
Sure but you get bonus cards elsewhere now and there's nothing more you need in perception aside from ground pounder or concentrated fire.  Meanwhile you're able to spec more points now into luck, agility, and intelligence to get some sweet buffs there.  Of course it would be useful but it is unnecessary and detracts from the purpose of breaking them into 3 perk card sets.
---
Good point on not learning it to keep it out of the legendary rolls.
---
Skills, na man, character, probably, (no offense).  I use electric absorption which essentially negates all energy damage.  I also have a hand full of other damage negation tricks, so they really help.  Thanks for serving.
---
What?
---
I have an unyielding set of secret service minus the right arm. plus the underarmor. yes I am told legendary varients are possible once you learn the plan. but still even with the bonuses I still dont do as much damage as shown in videos.
---
My main character is an unarmed melee and demolition build. Trust me... it’s highly effective if you know when/how to use them. Floater grenades do suck.
---
A lot of people like to go in wearing troubleshooter armor pieces. So they take less damage from robots. Along with troubleshooter weapons so they deal more damage to enemy robots. 
---
But honestly, as a bloodied build I just go in there and kill everything without a problem. The ONLY thing that can kill me in there is the assultron. Her laser beam melts me like butter. Other than that, everything is pretty easy for me to punch or shoot. 
---
It also helps that you have energy protection for the lasers (refractor perk) and any protection for ballistic damage.
---
The robots seem to overspawn compared to the other 2. Especially cuz the gutsy are all the armor piercing types and there is like 6 or 7 every 10 feet. The boss for them is ridiculous as well imo.
---
Its one of The Rare items can be drop in Daily ops .
---
If Bethesda Remove Daily ops , yeah This outfit can be legacy
---
i only use it because i like the sound effect when it triggers
---
Thanks for the reply
---
When they ask who's ready to get their ass kicked, they're not joking.
---
Yea i would be fine if I could have finished the op but being kicked sucked.
---
You monster.
---
Can we get an acknowledgement that NW will get ANY kind of support in the future!?
---
I yeet all mine in the air and pretend they are fireworks at the end of a session
---
Not sure transparent surfaces stopping rain is possible, the way rain collision works.
---
Well done. Seems to fit right in. I like dense CAMPS.
---
it's a vastly different game.  Your old pvp shenanigans won't work any longer and in all likelyhood your old build is no longer op though without knowing exactly what perks/gear you used it's hard to say.
---
If you just had the old op tse weapons, then no that is not remotely op any longer.
---
Yeah tried that and it was very poor , it hit but only a sliver of damage like you would expect with no magic - do I need one of the magic effects aswell as the 15% block ? Is it still working for you ? Thanks for taking the time , got loads of collected shells and want it to work so I can go play 😂
---
No they weren't I have the multiple bullet wounds to prove it
---
Yes, camp destruction is a part of the game.
---
Unless you're using unintended way of destroying it, such as bug usage, exploit usage, some cheat program, etc. In such cases Beth should part player and the game.
---
I addressed every single one of your concerns. I even offered to help you with anything you need. I'd really like to understand what your specific issue is here?
---
What part of this is “pure shit”?
---
You shouldn't be missing out on two. I haven't done a daily op yet and have got the golden reward each day. Each day has one daily op challenge, one NW challenge, five other challenges and the "complete 5 dailies" challenge. Same thing today:

 [Daily Reset Thread, Sept. 19 2020 : fo76 (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ivwde0/daily_reset_thread_sept_19_2020/)
---
Most videos you see on YouTube are people who take food buffs and drugs. As well as using certain perks that temporarily boost your damage. 
---
But not counting those. From my point of view as a melee player. You’re looking for a full set of unyielding. Whatever under armor gives you max strength. A bloodied version of the weapon. And all 3 slugger perks on. Bloody mess is a must. Adrenal mutation and the nerd rage perk are a must as well. 
---
I can’t give you an accurate number to compare since I don’t own it.
---
Thank you! All of that helps a lot :)
---
when you are encountering a large mob of enemies just chuck a grenade and watch them explode. ofc with one wasteland nothing dies in one hit anymore which absolutely sucks. so either several bullets and them charging you from all directions or some grenades that wipe out several at a time.
---
Shoulder mounting.
---
1) Yes laser has been sorta buffed in the sense that it supposedly does the correct damage now, apparently laser was weak because most of the damage was blocked by enemy armour but I've read that's been fixed.
---
2) Personally I have never had a problem finding 308 (i normally get rid of loads), however the lmg is a bullet hose so you'll still probably struggle
---
Also theres something I didnt think about until my friend mentioned it, you can also scrap those 6 cards for 12 more points to spend on legendary perks since at level 1 infiltrator you dont need any of them
---
From “I’m” to “coming back?”
---
10/15/20 is the semi-auto accuracy bonuses, and as far as i remember have always been this way. And these numbers are as it is intended.
---
2/3/4 is the current and correct automatic rifle accuracy bonuses, it used to be 2/3/20 but that was a bug.
---
1/2/3 is the damage buff that both receiver types share.
---
no, the rewards are not purchaseable via atoms.
---
I actually think plasma &amp; fusion cores arent supposed to drop but I could be misinformed. Given the weight of them they might be an issue
---
That's exactly what I use them for. Better than nothing
---
Think that this ops are daily, even if they change the rewards per season there are more than 60 days left, and no more more than 10 rate rewards, I think it's very easy to get them all, I have the complete suit, both signs and the reactor in only 3 days.
---
So far I've got Brotherhood Special Ops outfit and helmet, a solid power panel plan, Whisper in the dark plan, cage light plan, sign plan... Pretty good loot if you ask me.
---
Everything in the game should be dropable, tradeable, sellable. Anything else really doesn't make sense (minus maybe skins)
---
Only reason I didn’t die was a vampire handmade on auto and even then it was a close run. I’m working on a full set of ss troubleshooter armor.
---
Super sledge used to be able to 3 shot players in the (again i still don’t remember the name) titanium armour, I assume this was scaled down?
---
The search perks used to be non passive, so you would loot a container, then have to actively press the search button to use the perk
---
maybe try the verify and repair files option in the launcher?
---
Yes, yes and yes.
---
I only have 1 point sneak and 1 point escape artist, no armor sneak points, and have no problem sneaking thru west tek. As I said, just an extra punch or two now. The legendary explosions are a happy surprise
---
Trading seems like a big hassle in this game. If I get advised that the value of a weapon I got is 'trade only', I'll put in my machine for 10-12k and someone ends up very happy.
---
I agree, she is pretty sexy.
---
Pretty sure that was a while ago
---
So enemies do drop ultracite ammo of you're using a ultracite weapon?
---
Check your messages.  I sent you info that will help you out if you want it.  The filthy casuals are offering aid to any new players to help them through patch 22.  Armor, weapons, and aid.  Find someone on your platform and hit them up.
---
yeah sorry bud I'm no expert on that topic but gl and have fun.
---
Some new Under Armor type could be used instead of armor. No DR, just effects...
---
They must have gotten buried then because I hadnt seen anything mentioned or else I would have weighed in. I do actually read. But thanks for bringing it to my attention because it means its an oversight and hopefully if tickets etc are put in it might get fixed
---
Mmm.. 462 with around 30% of my HP, however I have the weighted mod for my SS arms and the Puncturing Power Fist mod as well, so it's working pretty sweet 😊👍🏻
---
Yeah i have adrenal as well. Thinking of getting the mutation that boosts melee. Think its twisted muscles?
---
Oh okay
---
Yup, and dont get me started if they attack a workshop. I captured one a bit ago to do the weekly challenge of building camp stuff (i didnt wanna muck up my camp so i decided to do it in a workshop).  Defend 3 waves of molerats, i did a wave and half, it took like 20 minutes because they just wouldnt pop back up and would teleport to the otherside of the workshop. I just gave upa nd turned the game off.
---
To me, this feels like beth has just pit random stuff together to make an enemy. Not sure why, it just doesnt feel like the sort of enemy you would encounter in the wasteland. I enjoy the event but it seems weird
---
Edit: Awesome picture by the way
---
My solution was to crouch behind the guy in PA like a human shield type set up and vats
---
Ya, so with this update it really does make them pointless.
---
You know. Its fine we all get more xp, but damn, I get kinda tired with 50% of my enemies no matter where i am being level 100.
---
How do I get this outfit?dailyops?
---
Oh nice! I didn’t realize it was for that long! I’m gonna wait out on the trades then for sure and see when I get it!
---
It's the robots, man. The fucking gutsies. It's Encryptid but inside a toilet with all lights pointing at you.
---
Not with the millions of Plasma Grenades I get.
---
If you're at Watoga Station, and you're running toward Big Bend Tunnel down the tracks, the train car that is open and you can walk through it just before you get to the Repair yard, there's a barrel where plans spawn on top of inside of the traincar.
---
Then when you keep going toward Big Bend Tunnel, the NAR repair yard has a barracks building, when you go inside it, on your right(opposite the explosives crate), there's another place for a plan spawn there on a table.
---
If they're not there, someone beat you to them - maybe me:)
---
I go through there pretty regular and grab those plans, usually some good stuff, Marine Armor plans, Marine Wetsuit, some underarmor plans(Flannel Shirt, Plain White T - both of those are pretty rare to find there from my experience at least), BOS Officer, BOS Knight uniforms, sometimes you also find robot armor plans there.
---
There's also a couple of plan spawn points on the other end of Watoga, at the Flooded Trainyard. An open car that is closest to the white building with the safe inside - the plan is at the back of the car on the bottom shelf. And in one of the buildings in the Fort Defiance end of the Trainyard where there's an Armor bench has another plan spawn - with similar plans to the other two spots that also show up there.
---
Cursed shovel FTW. Nice to have it handy for Buried with Honor without wasting 6 lbs on it.
---
Agreed the nuke for ACP doesn't make a ton of sense. As to the blast mines though, they are just mines. I use them if I have them to mine one or two of the steps up to the Bot Stop when I solo Robots on Parade.
---
I don’t know what weapons you use/have. 
---
Or what type of build your character is. But if you’re looking to do a little extra damage, i suggest investing some points into sneak. 
---
And then add a suppressor to your gun so you can use the perk covert training (up to 3x damage when sneaking)
---
Or if you’re a melee build, get the perk card ninja. (While sneaking do 3x melee damage)
---
It's all about passive mode. If you have it off, this game is wasteland COD. Turn it on and you end all the headaches. They really need to explain that better in-game. It would've made your issue never happen.
---
There's a bunch of trolls that run around looking for people who don't know about passive. I'm sorry you were their victim 😥
---
Yikes I can tell you’re not very fun to play with, the game was very different at launch and I got a head start compared to casual players by having a massive level advantage, if you’re not gonna say anything intellectual or helpful then don’t comment at all :)
---
&gt; if they would increase the damage 
---
You do realize that the simplest damage increasing is not the way of working on and fixing every legendary effect and/or perk in the game, don't you? Beth has... not tons, but atleast several possibilities to make berserker work much, much more effective than simply adding damage for every other affected parameter.
---
Wrong sub. Try the market sub, but I feel compelled to tell you it's unlikely to get one for caps right now, cause people are going crazy for it. I would wait a month for prices to drop.
---
You still need to spec, otherwise the damage ramps up from slap damage to tickle damage
---
That's a bit of a tedious work around just to get 200 rounds, you'd spend at least little over half an hour getting 1k ammo, while in that same time i can do a lead run and craft about 17-18k ammo.  
---
I use a vampire .50 machine gun to run ops, so i expend a little more ammo for the benefit of being virtually immortal, so i don't expect to recoup all of my ammo, but it is a bit daft that a system put in place to ease ammo woes so woefully misses the mark.
---
You’re right. It might not be enough
---
Well that explains a few things...
---
I agree.
---
You must Have +50 level
---
Every day you have 1 chance to Drop rare items
---
So Complete Daily ops mission on Elder Rank Reward !
---
They don't allow you to sell ammo (as you'd end up with thousands and thousands caps by selling a few hours worth of ammo and this would destroy the already broken economy), however there is an ammo converter you can place in your camp where you 'sell' ammo to it for 'points'. You can spend the points on any ammo you want
---
In the new terms of use that everyone had pop up on their screens a few weeks ago it actually against the rules to grief other players now
---
Yea, there is that - compared to ballistic weapons, my (focused) gatling plasma is very sensitive to controller movement - which can make SBs rather challenging at times.  
---
Now that I think about it, so are gatling lasers...Guess you could try decreasing X/Y sensitivity in the control panel, but not sure how badly that would affect other aspects....
---
Always been true. But looks like I can update my route to add some diversity now.
---
NW basically normalizes players/weapons against each other. Level is pretty much only an indicator of how much you play.
---
Imagine standard FPS shooters but with a Fallout vibe and worse controls.
---
Can’t really say much about the Hacker experience since I haven’t really experienced it.
---
Adrenal reaction gives extra damage to all and any weapon damage you cause. 
---
Talons increases your unarmed damage. 
---
Twisted muscles increases your melee damage 25% and makes it easier for you to cripple enemies. 
---
There’s other mutations you can get to maximize your strength and strength damage. As well as certain attacks or powers to damage nearby enemies. But those 3 mutations I listed are ones that boost melee damage.
---
Get yourself a Tesla rifle for the invisible ones. It fucks them up. Also, you can maybe throw molotovs at them and turn them into torches.
---
They do work, but with the nerf, some enemies are harder to kill. Blood Eagles? I still kill them with one shot. With robot enemies, I have to fire twice. I’m not complaining - I don’t want to cheese every event.
---
Yeah dude, no way you reached 100 in a week. Did you just play 24 hrs a day? Come on...
---
For the whole build thing, I don't really... have one of those. I know, I know, not efficient. But it works out for me in normal gameplay. I guess if I had to pick what I normally do, it would be melee. My main sword is an anti-armor spiked ski sword that is actually really good. But I do commonly use heavy weapons and other guns, mainly my Vampire's Short Lever Action Rifle, my Frontier Justice (which is a shotgun that gives +10 action points, my executioner's auto grenade launcher, my ported Gatling plasma, and my two-shot Gatling gun.
---
The sneak damage perks do seem really useful, as well.
---
I think u mean ultracite armour and yh way scaled let's say the average plays health is the same as a super mutant at lv 50 your looking at 5 to 7 hits with out crits or snesk
---
I really don't know how long they where, but by the moment seems that they will never change, it will be awesome if they change every season but I really don't think so. 
---
So you will have all the time and they will be as common as ultracite pa plans.
---
I got several magic weapons and the "magic" is iffy. It usually takes 2 shots from shotguns in vats to kill enemies but if vats breaks for whatever reason health rubber bands like a mother fucker. 
---
Also I'm pretty garbage at vats. Half the time the foes right leg is selected but last night I finally targeted the damn SB's head and it was down in two. 
---
And to be fair on my magic heavies, I don't have the frame rate to proc under 200rpm.
---
I gotta ask, what does everyone on here have against those things lol
---
Give it 2-3 weeks and you can buy them off player vendors for few hundred caps. Except the glaive plan, that can't be traded.
---
Sounds good but I'm usually solo running. My stealth unyielding bloodied build are absolutely painful when facing robots in daily ops....hiding behind hard covers only to find mr.gusty keeps hitting me through walls!! however, my PA build can tank the heck out of these robots.
---
Just start a team when you are going in, it gives everyone in game a notice
---
Sorry, dupers ruined that for us.
---
I felt a little cheated yesterday after the daily OPs, I did more then my fair share of the work (set up all of the objectives and stayed by all of them then killed the boss at the end) and I didnt get any rare plans, 2 of my 3 team mates both got things I wanted :P  (symptomatic and large generator) and today 1 also got the solar generator....  
---
1 did offer me the generator plan but I said no as i'd get it eventually anyway, but felt a little cheated by the system there ngl
---
Clearly more fun than you! I never trashed a camp, or waited outside vault 76 for newbies to challenge. Intellectual? You don’t even know how to use the correct “their”....
---
Regarding bases, the trick is to find a location away from regular enemy spawn markers.
---
Yeah, my brother in law noticed and were a little surprised.  
---
If it hadn't been robots, it would've been okay; but when you get swarmed by loads of Mr Gutsys...  
---
There was a reason in our third go he pulled out his gauss minigun...
---
I would say no. It's way better to avoid damage altogether than having to mitigate it. Dodgy, for instance, is a much better choice IMO.
---
They ain't bad.i kinda like em
---
It scales to your level every where now. So if a level 10 is there and you’re the enemy will be 10 for you it will be 50 to 100.
---
People dont want to grind and want it put on a plate tbh like it's been out near a week were not gonna have every item just given too us automatically and I'm not saying all player but some
---
Turrets that I was placing in a workshop yesterday were all at level 50.
---
It already does, just not in the way you probably want. You gain adventure mode XP based on your performance in NW which becomes levels that = perk cards. The XP amount is almost worthless for the time required, though.
---
buy serums. should cost no more than 500 caps each. anyone else charging more is having a laugh. if you're on xbone i sell them for 250 each
---
One benefit is if you just did an &lt;8 minute daily op run with that team and they start another you know they want to farm xp, ammo, and stims so everyone can take it easy and not rush the objective
---
I'm a stealth commando build and started carrying around a 2 star magic shot gun that I recently got. Can confirm that it's pretty magical when using vats at semi close range. It can one shot most normal mobs, and has been my primary weapon in daily ops.  I try not to use it during things like uranium fever, though, since it takes out the legendaries too fast and I don't want to be an ass to others.
---
It's not just in this game. ESO had housing that'd leak water (Exorcised Coven Cottage). Seems to be their pet bug.
---
Mhm. I see. You try to have a little bit of everything. Are you on PS4 by any chance. I might not have anything so I don’t want you to get excited, but I may or may not have some legendary weapons in my stash collecting dust. If I see anything worth while, I don’t mind giving it to somebody that can put it to good use.
---
“Shouldn’t you be killing Super Mutants?”

-BoS Collectron
---
(This isn’t an exact quote but I’m too lazy to check)
---
Flux is an end game crafting item. Drops from Scorched Beast Queen and Earl. Can also be made from nuked plants. Depending what level you are, you won’t need it for a while. As for the Spec Ops suit, yes, currently people are trading all sorts for it. See if you can get yourself a good weapon or two while you can.

---
This makes a lot of sense
---
???
---
enemies scale to individual players.  if you are lvl 500 and your friend is lvl 30, you might see a level 100 super mutant while your friend will perceive that exact same enemy as lvl 30.
---
You will damage the enemy as you would any other lvl 100 super mutant, your friend will damage the enemy as he would any other lvl 30 super mutant so you will both be able to make a contribution towards killing the enemy.
---
The only case when you have to worry about spawning enemies too high level for your friends is if they are super low level and you are in a high level region like the cranberry bog or a high level event like sbq, earl, etc.  in those cases low levels will be facing enemies above their pay grade.
---
Alr I'd suggest badcompanyasarg and angry turtle for the build , captain noob for weapons and final render for camps
---
I am on PS4! :)
---
People who have the serum recipes will most likely craft them for you at the cost of a few hundred caps, some will also have them in their vending machines for the same proce so I'd suggest having a look around.
---
I've been shot at by scorched before, only to find they have a pencil and a spoon on them
---
Yeah I said in a reply above that yesterday I felt a little cheated out of a reward as I more then pulled my weight in the 2 sets of daily ops we managed (elder on both)  
---
After 1 of them 2 of the 3 people i was with got a large generator and a symptomatic which is what im after, I got no rare plan at all
---
What's ur gamertag? I wouldn't mind checking ur vendor out
---
Idk doesn't seem hard to get them. I even got two of the plans from one run before.
---
Cant drop them either?
---
Ye but i mean as in the winning team gets 50 points each or something
---
rare is rare
---
Honestly, its faster just to throw them haha.
---
Nice photo. Love it, I try to remember taking one during these times but I always forget. Or when I do remember I go in get it all setup to get the perfect pic and then.... you have to many photos pops up on top left. Lol so yeah, but nice pic.
---
Yh ik how you feel it did it to me I think leaving the server and doing the beginning part again should fix it and dont leave the chat box screen so clear out all enemy's before so it doesnt bug
---
I disagree, you can sell/trade most of them
---
It's not that, it's that I aim in the same place and the projectiles shoot out like a shotgun
---
If you’d like, I can add you when I get home from work later. I’d be happy to modify some weapons and armor for you. I might even have underarmor you can use. Most of the good stuff I gave to my gf. Since she gets first dibs obviously. But I do have a lot of stuff that I’ll never use and since I’m not really a vendor I just keep. In case one of my friends needs it. Or like now, another player could benefit from it. 
---
Killer-Soldier1 is the psn. 
---
I won’t be home until around 10:30. So I don’t know if you’ll be on or not.
---
If you have any glitches used to build or the camp is too large it won’t let you place it as a blueprint.   Most times I moved my camp I just have to rebuild it.
---
rammadeus. as long as you promise not to clear me out of serums =0 
---
Are you on now? if you are i'll pop on. if not i'll go back to my moooovie
---
You have been nerfed. Nothing you can do but accept your new numbers.
---
I have a min+max unarmed ninja. Perfect fighter. He was also a tank. Now he is just a tank. My advice is: keep the strength and get even tankier.
---
and its not atom purcasable item neither
---
They are not gonna make it that easy. If you couldn't get duplicate plans the whole daily ops would be quite short lived experience. Even more than now. As you can always trade unwanted plans with other players if you really want some specific plan.
---
I’ll help revive someone out 3-4 times, probably carry them through a run if they’re really trying to contribute, but I’m not their mom.  If they start feeling parasitic, they’re on their own.  You don’t have to have a super build, just help with the uplinks timers and try to do some crowd control.
---
I get that someone might get distracted with something happening in real life and get shot up, so I’m not going to be cold hearted.  If it keeps happening or they shoot each enemy once just to farm ammo, I’ll be less inclined to consider them a team member.
---
If I’m heavily frozen, I’m going to kill enemies first.  I can still try to get us an Elder time.  I’ve yet to die in an op, but I assume you just respawn at the entrance?  The best thing I can do for everyone is work on beating the clock.
---
I agree it's not necessary for this game, but it is a fun. Plus since I waste more ammo with my inefficient build, the extra scavenging helps to get more ammo. I'm not a big fan of crafting ammo.
---
Ngl no one is gonna give suck a rare item away dont meen to sound rude but go grind it's not just gonna be handed to u and when it does sell your looking at 5k to 10k caps at best
---
I’m going to be upfront, I xp glitched, there was a way to infinitely disarm a trap and I remember watching the venom movie while spamming A on my controller
---
Well, I don't know what timezone you live in, but I'll probably be able to get on. Unless it's, like, midnight on my end.
---
Same here :( and this camp is a lot of work. I dont want to rebuild....
---
It’s 6:46 pm right now for me. I’ll be home 10:30.
---
Yeah I think ultracite it is, so I’m guessing melee is no where near as viable anymore?
---
It'll be 11:30 PM for me then
---
Will try this later on, if it works you saved my sanity.  Was also trying to save up tokens.
---
I truly loved the last two events of mutants and blood eagles. They were easy. The first ops was a pain and was the worst. This one I did first solo being no one joined me on team. Well I thought I was going to do good until god damn pacific rim robot at the end. Robot ones I’m prob going to have to do team to get elder, other ones I can def do solo with no problem. I used my vamp gauss mini last two days and never died. Today no matter how much I hit them I couldn’t heal enough. Good thing it only took two try’s to get elder and got me a new plan. The burrow signs
---
I also try 40 mm grenades and a fat boy and you can't get any part of his body to glitch out thanks Bethesda awesome game
---
Yh sad ti say unless u do bloodied sneak with unyielding armor no piont as you just dont do damage sorry mate
---
Thank you very much for this info. I'll be sure to make use of it.
---
Thanks! So after 2,000 hours on Xbox I switched to PC and found out there isn’t a limit in the 76  photo gallery on PC. Think I have over 1,000 pictures so far. It’s unfortunate console players have to constantly manage the photo gallery and clear space.
---
YES! I always have wondered that cause I started playing after one wasteland. I was so confused how someone with a pipe revolver would drop a plasma sniper rifle.
---
I usually just keep it on me when needed for rad zones or if i just wanna run around invisible.  but use a full set of ss unyielding armor as the norm for the legendary perks.  But buy it’s self it’s a good alternative if you don’t have better legendary armor.
---
Colossal twice this morning
---
That's what Berserker characters already do. We break really good armor and use the Legendary effects from it with 0 DR.
---
Pretty sure 3 levels of legendary means you just auto unlock everything
---
or if the bug happens
---
I have played everyday since the patch and have only received Caged Bulbs and Burrows signs.  My rng luck sucks.
---
Well. I’ll be on until 4am regardless.
---
Get troubleshooters armor set, even 1\* and any armor type or level. Problem solved.
---
You can bind the keys in game. The option is under settings/controls.
---
I have mine set for the middle mouse button.
---
in daily ops you get only 3-4 rounds.. how about that?
---
Exactly.  The enemies will wander over to your location anyways, so there’s no reason to kill them while not in an objective zone.  I just sprint past everything while getting to the uplinks, and focus only on enemies with a diamond over their head at the end.  I can clean up the stragglers when the clock stops.
---
I’ve even started inching my way towards the next uplink when the bar is almost full.  Every second counts while solo.
---
I fucking hate those grenades.  And yes, fucking hate is a next level above hate...
---
So I have had some good ones that I started using recently when I watch turtles video. I have a quad that’s magic and other ones but I got a 3 star bloodied magic pump to drop from a ghoul last week. I use that bad boy and you will notice sometimes it’s one hit and others it will miss over and over again. I just back out of vats and keep doing that until it hits. Torso shots usually work more then head. I don’t use armor for it either I just use shotgun
---
I'm really trying to do this, and other have suggested, triple tap, going in and out then back into VATS, sometimes it works.
---
All very awkward and uncomfortable, it is a shame as I'm really liking the damage output and survivability of my Vampire's Gauss shotgun.
---
What bug
---
You need sleeeep
---
I’m nowhere near getting the SS armour yet
---
I'll try that
---
:( ok
---
Yh its random however there are other places which have power armor theres a good video on YouTube or sever hopping is your best bet good luck
---
it’s been mentioned on other comments in this thread but basically if you have a certain perk card atm you can be pvp’ed no matter what
---
Troubleshooters armor baby. I don't even have a complete set and it still makes surviving waves of bots a cakewalk
---
In the Controls section of setting nothing is interactable, it's just a list, maybe my game is buggered 🤷‍♂️
---
Honestly it doesn't seem that bad. The difficulty of the map just varies from 1 hit to 2 or 3 hits. 
---
Hack and Slash definitely gives melee crowd damage and the explosions are a lot of bonus damage that all scale so I just wanted to know if there are better builds around it that buff it like with Demolition Expert. It would help in boss fights if surrounding enemies take more damage because hitting the enemies close to the boss would make the boss take more damage.
---
Apart from the bosses the worst I got today was about 4 or 5 hits to kill the glowing mirelurk queens. Still a hit or 2 on the kings that spawned during the queen and I could kill a lot of the wendigos in a colossal problem without event taking a look at them. That's before the damage buffs and improvements I'm considering for buffing the new perks and getting extra regular perks fitted in with the legendary strength making up for a loss. I haven't seem many builds take advantage of 15 strength for the perks and neither have I so the legendary strength gives more perk slots than I know what to do with
---
there was a sale, axe and pipe at half price...
---
Yeah I don’t think it’s worth the perk slot.  Especially since the Asbestos lining is a thing, better off using that slot for another perk you need.
---
Yeah the ambient "world" music has new tracks that are clearly brotherhood.  Just my opinion but i don't much like it.  I never much liked the idea of the brotherhood (a fledgling post war military organization formed in California) showing up in WV 20 or so years after the great war.  Even the brotherhood of Fallout 3 seemed to barely have adequate resources to trek from cali to DC.  It is what it is but i still think they could have made a whole new faction
---
Interesting. I’ll look into it.
---
Try soloing it or doing it multiple times, someone should join it sometime
---
That game is running on a completely different engine. Not comparable.
---
The dynamic rain occlusion made it's debut in Fallout 4, and it's still some seriously impressive tech, but not being blocked by transparent surfaces is just one of the fundamental limitations due to how it works.
---
Not sure if there's some workaround they could implement, but the way things are now, if a texture has transparent parts, rain falls through those parts.
---
&gt;I’ll look into it.  
---
and do what?
---
It seems out of all of the varients, the robot shave the most spawns! Which is a pain as they're the hardest to fight already without the extra spawns!
---
Well no wonder im hearing it all the time at my camp which is like 300 feet from pleasant Valley
---
Shit when the meat week was over I offered all chally outfits and chefs outfits for 50 caps each.  Thought I would be nice for those that missed it.  Nope, some asshat bought them all.
---
Yh areas have set levels untill they scale sorry mate same thing happened to me in cranberry bog
---
Then I’d deff use it until you find a set of legendary armor you like the perks on.  Then just keep it when needed.
---
Yea, maybe it is a bug in this case. As for me, I was able to click on that particular ability then I click on the middle mouse button. That way it changed the keybind to the middle mouse button.
---
I’m not worried about pvp with other players. But my gf is a baby level 16. So I’ll look into it to make sure whatever happens to OP doesn’t happen to her.
---
Right, it’s a pain. If you “move” camp but leave it as is you should be able to place everything like it was because it will save as a blueprint. Yea it makes your camp ugly as fuck having random floors but is necessary especially with the new combat system
---
Or: give me your Floater Grenades! I fucking love them, they’re good fun.
---
Hopefully we see it next week...
---
When the atop shop resets and gets new stuff.
---
If some nard kicks you from a public team there is nothing stopping you from immediately rejoining and  pissing them off. I used to do this all the time. If they want to actually keep you off the team they have to block you. Just keep rejoining until they give up and stop being a nard. 👍
---
Oh, I thought it happened when you were playing FO76! 😄
---
They are worth 20k caps. Sold 2 of em in less than a minute of posting them on other subreddits
---
every single day. the same 'i heard..' 
---
until someone provides actual proof  i wouldn't be concerned.
---
im not even talking about that, im saying where in the game do you **need** to unlock something or hack something. i dont know of anything you **need** to do that to progress somewhere or get some thing you need
---
I feel liked these posts should be banned until someone can provide actual evidence. No idea if this was made in good faith or just to troll.
---
I'd say once u get all 3 ranks you it's a decent back up perk
---
Your right im sorry
---
Yh I was saying in the future and god well done in the sale
---
Does your name begin with a K?
---
xD The only viable gun is what angry turtle tells me!
---
My unarmed melee almost didn't get affected at all. Probably because all my stuff was additive before the patch.
---
Don’t sweat it that much. Repairing it is overall very few materials. They wasted their time, you won’t waste much of yours fixing it at all.
---
That's why I was 15 seconds short today.
---
It works wonders. 75% damage reduction from robots. Other stats on the armor don't matter. If you still feel you need extra survivability get a vampires weapon.
---
The hedgehog is being greedy about the hedge
---
He’s a hedge hog
---
its nice but when we have perk loadouts this will be worthless.. at least 50 perk points will be gone
---
I feel ya on point 1. Not on point 2. This particular mission has that mutation. Oh well. The next one may require stealth to succeed and people who don’t have stealth builds may get destroyed. Just adapt.
---
I think a lot of people are avoiding earl bc since the nerf he takes a lot more time to take down.   But I still find enough show up to get it done...even if it fails, farming the xp on the spawns is worth the ammo.
---
Totally valid. The problem is trying to get the elder rank done which usually needs at least two if not three people. At least at my current level, I don't know about later on.
---
My bloodied unarmed is essentially worthless. He is viable for the melee ops, and worthless outside of that. He went from 500 plus per whack to 67 against Earle.
---
They heavy..... Cant sell em... And honestly it's quicker to shoot something dead then go though the animation of throwing a granade.... And im playing a non vats non stealth semi rifle build....so you can just imagine what a waste it'll be on the vats stealth commando build that rely on instant kills...
---
Grenades don't have a place in this game atm... Besides free caps or helping people tag for xp and now that we fighting lvl 100 super mutants I'd love to know how many grenades would it take to kill... I have a feeling more then 7.
---
Bethesda deserves some of that blame, you can't control whether people will want to cheat, but you can control whether they are able to.
---
After Learning that my meta unarmed build can now only do 20 damage per punch to Earle, I decided to instead become a battle Photographer too!
---
People complaining about not having enough rewards after 5 days...
---
My onist opion is probs daily ops group up with high level friends and dink enemy's so u get xp PLUS ammo would suggest the hunting rifle and sleep before starting good luck out there
---
If you go the route of mutating yourself with radiation and not serums I would suggest a power plant.
---
The reactor core will provide with the rads you need and there are wash stations at the entrance of the core so you won't waste radaway. Just be sure to re-equip your starch before you scrub those rads away if you get a mutation you like.
---
happy hunting.
---
Ah, now that makes sense.
---
Cat lady house?
---
the nerf made them unfun, melee and rifle builds can't contribute at all anymore, so less people are interested in launching the nuke!
---
Wait you want 50 perk coins for winning one match? That seems a little lopsided... how long would 50 perk coins take in adventure mode?
---
But why don't I have them all already?! This is much to hard /s
---
As a level 261 Marketing Director, I appreciate your feedback, but you’ll need to address this to the level 128 Customer Relations Specialist before it goes to the Level 7 QA Supervisor.
---
there is no way to prove it. there will always be a bit of take my word for it. i could show a ss of my stash showing no guns for sale. and a ss of a gun being sold. you would still have to take my word i didnt put the gun for sale after the first ss 
---
someone would have to make a few **hours long** video starting by showing there stash and whats for sale, and then at some point catching it happening
---
Sorry..."Suppressor". https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;d=cm0
---
I'm playing on a french version of the game. I'm often making rought traductions, i shouldn't...
---
It's literally "Silencer" in french.
---
But yeah, personnally i only add Tenderizer if I have a Suppresor perk card rank 3. It's a really helpful perk card !
---
Yes and no. At least in my opinion. Take fallout 4 for example. When they introduced mods. I was extremely happy. Modifying the game so I can have ANY weapon/armor/ammo/legendary etc. 
---
It made the game fun for me because I could change things in the game I didn’t want, add stuff I thought the game needed, and if I wanted to have a full set of t-60 power armor along with my explosive minigun and wounding Gatling laser, I could. 
---
I think the people that dupe COULD benefit from the extra caps and stuff. Along with whatever weapon and armor they want to make multiple copies of. If I could dupe a legacy weapon, I could exchange it for any weapon or armor piece with whatever legendary effect I wanted. In return I’d give away one of the duped guns. I would still play the game like I normally do. The only difference is now I have the weapon I wanted.
---
Got a point but I don't agree with the grenades don't have a place lol as only level 40 their literally my crutch right now lol ill take any throwable I can get
---
As a low level who did a daily op I used the hunting rifle and did fine sorry u had to put with the pitch fork wielding maniac
---
Calm down. There are plenty of tips and hints from people on this sub already that will make the daily ops very easy to solo.
---
With 4 ranks of Master Infiltrator, any lock or computer up to level 3 is auto-unlocked.

I know. I play a Berserker also. However, using broken armor is utterly impractical and merely a workaround at best. The moment you need to get into a hazmat suit, you no longer can equip broken armor pieces afterward. You have to fix them and break them again. It's dumb. The only alternative is living in a broken CSA, which prevents wearing outfits and has none of the desirable effects that broken armor pieces might have.
---
its never ending waves.. enjoy
---
1. If you join a group, and then just jump into DO’s, that means you haven’t formed a bond that increases the bonus for being in the group. 
---
So if that’s the case, rushing in like that seems like why they might have kicked you out. Communication is important. 
---
2. Your choice. But the problem with single focus builds is they are dependent on the game not changing. When the game changed it new content that doesn’t follow what already is in the game, your build can easily not be as effective. 
---
However they have said the next batch of Daily Ops will be sneak friendly.
---
 I normally do a few random mutations before buying what I need in  serum form. I normally want most mutations for my characters.
---
For random mutation gaining, Emmett Mountain is my preferred Mutation farming location.
---
1. Has high rad/sec pools
---
2. Has a decontamination shower
---
3. Is an indoor cell, so unless radiation rumble is going on, you have the place to yourself. I over-radded myself a few times and died and dropped my junk. Since it's indoor, I respawned at the entrance.
---
You are restricted to 1 mutation per X number of hours (on a given server).
---
So if you server hop, you can get a new mutation.
---
Process
---
1. Take off Starched Genes
---
2. Walk into a highly radioactive pool
---
3. Run out before you die of over radiation
---
4. Check to see if you got a new mutation.
---
5. If not, put on Starched Genes Rank2 (So you don't lose any mutations you have already) and run through the decontamination shower near the entrance.
---
6. Repeat.
---
7. If you got a mutation, server hop and repeat.
---
Oh I get it but since the nerf I have fought Earle 6 times and queen 3. Each time we beat it with in ten minutes. Tonight it was just a bad server I guess or we got joined with ppl that didn’t wanna waste or weren’t prepared. Idk did fight the queen just now and it’s easy as long as we have ppl willing to fight
---
I kicked myself out of 2 Daily Ops today. 2 dudes had joined the party while I was soloing one. Wouldn't have been a problem but they were chatting with each other and eating chips into the mic. Decided to leave party instead of mute them both.. kicked from Op. Got salty.
---
Second time me and dude was duoing them, finally got Elder rank but I didn't want him to think I wanted to keep doing it. So I left party, kicked before I saw what rewards I got. Still got them, but eh.
---
If it’s an exploit... you can prove it by posting a video of it happening. Not screenshot...
---
Reproduce it if there is an exploit out there.
---
Been saying this forever. I would also love to see a frontiersmen set of cards set around black powdered weapons and hatchets/axes/bowie knifes.
---
Sometime between patches 22 and 99
---
You sir are the biggest bumbling idiot appalachia had ever seen
---
Yeah Xbox limit is crap. I know even on fortnite I get 10 replays on Xbox but pc can hold every one. And I noticed on angry turtles one video he was able to hold a bunch to bad Xbox couldn’t. I don’t wanna get rid of the ones I have but can’t take anymore
---
Especially when they heard from someone who heard from someone who heard from someone else.
---
You get them from killing bloatflies. They don’t always drop it, but there’s always a chance for it. A better question would be where could you find a lot of bloatflies. I’d you ever see the event “campfire tales” pop up. Go do it. A lot of bugs spawn in that event. And you can most likely obtain all the meat and parts for the quest you’re doing. 
---
I don’t know if the perception perk called “butchers bounty” can increase the chances of finding. Bloatfly gland after you kill them, but worth a look.
---
Heh.
---
Yeah I was excited to see what it could do, had same roll dropped way back. Put all those back on the mule.
---
I’ve been able to solo some of them if the map is small enough, but even having one more person with me I’ve gotten elder my first try the last 3-4 days, it was just day 1 of the patch I couldn’t get elder til like try #6 with one other person and that’s because I wasn’t exactly knowing that you had to stay near the beacon to get the bonus up. 
---
But yeah, it’s extremely hard to get elder as solo. I only did it today because I put on a full suit of troubleshooters and literally just sat there and ignored most of the robots.
---
sometimes vats + ironsight become buggy
---
This blueprint stuff is bugged shit, didnt ever work for me either. IF im about to move i always rebuild from scratch.
---
Im asking this to find out if its threu because People like that should not abuse it if does exist and dont try to silence someone Who is trying to find out for legitimate reasons, the fact that ur responding to it this way makes me think u already know about it and u dont like the fact People try to get it fixed assap.
---
Still a pointless need idea
---
My bloodied gunslinger build definitely took a hard hit, but i was lucky enough to have a back up revolver when the nerf hit
---
Where can I find the hunting rifle
---
You are the one that deserves no one on your team, considering you don't know how people build their characters. I can't share perks due to me having 2 points in charisma and i'm not going to spend a legendary perk slot with legendary charisma just to share a perk probably everyone has.
---
Hey mate sorry to hear this ik how u feel I'm level 20 and some level 200 kept walking in front of me as I shot so he could pvp me and 1 tap i had so much junk from 2 hours of farming all gone cause of them
---
Yeah I agree.  I think people just need to get used to and perfect their new builds.   I still enjoy both events.  But I can deff see a difference with earl.  He is deff more tanky now.  I’m burning through Ammo doing my normal nightly nuke drops,  I use at least 1 or 2k 45 ammo at each event.
---
read sub rules
---
If Bethesda were to make them a bit tougher to acquire and more effective weapons we wouldn’t have this problem.
---
Kinda sad panda, but it's nothing but a thing.
---
Yeah I know right. You kill a Scorched brandishing a pitchfork &amp; after you’ve killed them you don’t always get a pitchfork, more often than not you get a lead pipe or something else that in no way resembles a pitchfork. Frustrating &amp; makes zero sense.
---
Normally on low level scorched I'd suggest Morgan town airport as few spawn there if your on ps4 I'd be happy to mod or give u one I've already modded out
---
It is annoying. Usually I start it and someone jumps in but on average it’s half the team doesn’t even bother. Thankfully my two toons I’ve been using can solo if necessary.
---
A google search away
---
Yes and no. Mostly no, but there is going to be an Atomic Shop version of the BoS Spec Ops outfit that’s gray instead of camo, so you could purchase that instead of grinding if you wanted, whenever it comes out.
---
As for the rest, no.
---
You just can’t sneak,  but I switch to my vamp fixer and still wreck them.   I knew I saved it for some reason.  😂
---
I had one that was something about a Mr. Handy walking into a bar and there was no further punchline or anything. Wtf? Is it supposed to be funny just because a Mr. Handy has no legs? I mean it could still float into a bar. That was by far the worst one I've seen.
---
You're shooting it in the shell at falloff ranges for pistol. Try shooting in the face while closer.
---
Prepatch your shell shots would have done like 15 damage instead of 5. 
---
Still would need to shoot the unarmoured bits.
---
Same
---
During meat week, I had a teammate that went AFK while he was on the drums. His character was starving and dying of thirst. So he had a very small amount of health left. And no radiation. So he wasn’t bloodied obviously. 
---
When I was at my camp I decided to eat and drink. Then I noticed my teammate regenerated his health all the way back up. So I’m assuming it’s a limitless range. Because I was at my camp in whitespring.
---
There’s a note I’ve held on to for ages that used to be called ‘Your the Idiot’, and since the patch it’s changed to ‘You’re the Idiot’. Real stealth-nerf there
---
Your a good man op advictorim brother
---
The Enclave needs loyal citizens! :D
---
I hated Mirelurk Queens before the update, now I don’t even want to bother.
---
They nerfed irony in this patch
---
I'm a new lvl 30 player and the other night I gave a random lvl 150 the 200rds of 50cal ammo I had since I noticed his MG. He seemed embarrassed a noob was giving him stuff and bounced when I dropped another bag consisting of cores nukes and 11 missiles at his feet.
---
Big guns was never my playstyle, not in 12 years of playing Fallout games. Thought they could use it better haha.
---
Thanks.  This was very helpful.  
---
I think before I purchase them, I'd like to try and get a few via radiation dosing.  I wasn't considering the decon showers as a way to rid the rads.  I'll give this a try and see if I can get a few that I want without having to resort to purchasing.
---
Did this affect the heavy master and expert as well?
---
So base destruction has been removed then?
---
I don't like the idea of gimping myself for fun. I wnat the game to challenge me, not for me to give the game a crutch in order to challenge me.
---
It... was still free
---
Todd giveth and Todd taketh away
---
Input on what? What kind of build to switch to? Not really a clear question.
---
So I decided to give the plasma caster a rest and  craft the gauss minigun....got a bloodied on the 3rd try.  Even though bloodied is so nerfed now I am still happy!
---
I say make a perk in perception (luck maybe) that costs 4 and makes it so the game time is always treated like the optimal nocturnal time (for weapons and perks) as long as you are wearing sunglasses.
---
Call it “Shaded”
---
Yup, had this a few times before, if they were sat on something you can save them by storing what they were ontop of, otherwise you have to move camp to get them back!
---
True... I remember when I leveled up my 4 other builds had 100 molotovs at white springs window while my friend finished them off. Once you get to lvl 50 they start getting worse. Once you get better perks your bullets do close or more damage... So frag =4 caps so 4 bullets from players
---
Wow - congrats! :)
---
Insert buggy game comment here.
---
Click “The Build”, takes you to Nukes and Dragons where I saved it...
---
It was in the patch notes.  DID YOU NOT READ IT
---
Just teasing. I didn’t know either.
---
Are you planning to Max the archer peaks? That’s a brave move! I tried playing with the bow for a while but the fire rate seemed way too low.
---
I was pushing illegal keys, I just remapped Left Alt Bash to the Number Pad Enter key so I can kit it with my right thumb  😁
---
I'm happy 👍
---
As a semi combat rifle using maniac yes yes it does
---
I’m sorry this happened to your CAMP. There’s more than enough killing &amp; destroying that can be done in this game without resorting to destroying someone’s CAMP. Some piece of s**t nuked my brother’s CAMP - it was terrible, so I feel your pain. Hope you can re-build bigger &amp; better.
---
I boot anyone sharing rad sponge or sun kissed as I play Bloodied and people who share those are generally trolling.
---
There’s been 5 daily ops, what do you expect? At least you’re getting plans. It doesn’t go away
---
I just hope the atom shop has some good items I actually like this time. I'm sitting on almost 3000 atoms and haven't spent a dime in over 3 weeks cause everything's trash.
---
Why not?
---
I think they’re referring to the historical concept of the berserker as crazed warriors who fought sometimes literally naked
---
Yea probably not for most people but I play a lot of dark souls and i have gotten particularly well at it so games being unforgiving is nothing new. Though I’m sure some low levels are thinking that exact thing right now but with this game
---
woosh
---
I did. I did a lot more shooting than what’s in the video. Headshots did nothing to them.
---
Dude you just opened my eyes. Thank you
---
Yeah, collecting all of that loot on a single tile in Fallout 1/2 after killing someone with explosives
---
Yeah f@#k that robot at the end, twice i  thought we had enough time to get elder and  that robot just went NOPE not letting you have it. 8.15, 8.42 
---
Game devs musta thought, I know, the players LOVE the assaultrons we'll crank one up to 11, give it miniguns and let it spam it's assaultron laser like there's no tommorow
---
Yes I am also the same with the ammo use. He def did get spongy. I do at most head shots I think 100 but mostly 84. Before it was over 200. But I don’t care like you said I like the events. And ammo not really worried about it anymore being I have maxed out legendary ammo card and I can craft a holy grail amount with a little bit of resources. I like the patch and everything that came with it. If anything I think they should bring earles health down a little or armor or the real thing I want is it to be more then 8 ppl. Being I got in a instance and at least 6 where there and then it ended up being only 3 of us. So being they joined no one else could. If they opened it up more then I would’ve had more ppl. I don’t know it’s whatever tho
---
Damage doesn't work that way. You need to factor dr/er into the equation.  Same formula as fo4: 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
You have to learn the plans.
---
Does dodgy work in power armor? I can't get the wiki to load on my phone right now.
---
Anything to do with its resistance? Behemoths have 250 ish br/er.
---
I like the 15 per and luck. You need that for vats. The agility can come down a bit if you're not stealth. You don't need marathoner and action boy if your not pa. Otherwise looks good to me. The white knight keeps the armor nice while taking one for the team. Lone wanderer is useless though if you herd and play public teams. Probably do strange in numbers and travel or inspirational.
---
You need to find the plans for the weapons and learn them. Some plans only come from specific events or players vending if they are tradable. 
---
The Fixer, Bear Arms, the new Glaive from Daily Ops. The Tenderizer from Meat Week. There’s more can’t remember.
---
Any weapon in the game at the start you can get without knowing how to craft them.
---
I will count them tomorrow and i'm fairly sure i'd only be able to squeeze 200,maybe 300 coins.there is absolutely no way I could reach 2514.
---
That's great, thanks again.
---
Yep i just ended up giving me second ops mask away since i have no use for it and i have max caps most of the time. Reclaimed deep mining gas mask all the way!  I only use helmets with an actual headlamp, fuck that pip boy light that is horrible.
---
1k of each variety, maybe 2k of florescent with how much is at the white spring, sure. 10k of an individual variety, no way in hellfire that's legit.
---
Not comparable yet the same annoying issue.
---
Technical breakdown thanks for that.
---
It sure does.
---
As someone who used the suit ince in the daily I'd like to say sorry to my friends as I didn't realise u couldn't sneak
---
Um no... I don’t like someone screaming that the sky is falling and people should shut down the vendors when there is no evidence this is even a thing.
---
Gotcha. Let’s start with what weapons you have or are wanting to use? I looked at your build and I am not an expert but I see a lot more quality of life perks in your build than I normally see. But non pa builds don’t seem very common. I run a non PA heavy guns build with an AA Plasma caster. I don’t have many problems.
---
Thank you, I'll look into that as well then.
---
Nope. It's another *good* removed feature from Fallout 4.
---
you need to learn the plans. fixer plans go for aboot 7k. bear arm plans 15k+. the sheep stuff probably not a lot but you can get them from free range which isn't hard. tenderizer plan will cost you your soul and first born child.
---
I would be surprised, sounds like too much work and too good of an idea for Bethesda to pull it off. Plus it would probably hinder the garbage servers and make crashes even worse than they already are having player pets. I still get multiple crashes daily id rather it not start hitting double digit numbers lol
---
I know right? We were lucky yesterday when we had to SQ once and Earle twice. That was it. And yes, I think it was like before we saw it again.
---
Yeah this definitely needs to be addressed. I've got the outfit as well and am super annoyed by this. Hoping it gets a fix sooner rather than later. 
---
Hell, I'd settle for a scarf to wear lol.
---
I can still kill thinks while bloodied. Instead of my usual one punch now it’s two. Big deal right? 
---
My bloodied heavy guns still kill things in 2-3 bullets.  
---
And I’m honestly always going to be a bloodied build simply because of the unyielding armor.
---
If have no intention in taking allot of time to try and find out if its actualy going to happen Because the chance of that happening to one of my camps is very small so thats why i made this post in the first place to find out if others have had this happen to them. And if it did so happen then there's other to make that proof happen would't it? Have a great Day.
---
Yh or for when u kill a 3 star enemy and his friend shots his body halfway across the map with a missile launcher
---
I would just join a Daily Ops team. You'll be helping with the uplink connection speed. Take a few shots here and there, earn the rewards, and you'll get the lay of the land as you play more.
---
I can solo it on all 4 of my characters. But they're all well-geared, well optimized build (B HW in PA, B Rifleman/Commando, B Melee/shotguns, Junkie Unarmed/Shotguns). 
---
The Ops are all about time. As long as you rush to each location and start the timers immediately, and don't leave the Bonus area (stay close enough to the uplinks to maintain 1x bonus), you can complete the uplink portions in ~6:30 minutes on most maps (I get lost in the Burrows, not sure I could do it on that one). Then it's just a question of how fast you can move/much DPS you can do to down the last squad and the final boss to nail the sub-8min timer.
---
It takes couple seconds for the server to realize that the client has gone poof if you don't leave the normal intended way, so anything that is about to happen to you in that brief moment still happens to you. Most of the time atleast, depends on network. This is true for most online games in my experience.
---
You can build on other peoples camps? Or was this a workshop?
---
I usually just see which direction the bullet or laser is coming from and shoot in that direction.
---
&gt; Lore-wise there is 0 good reason for a ghoul not to be able to kill you, t
---
And there is zero reason for not being able to one shot a humanoid enemy with one or two bullets to the head.
---
You can vats grenades. In fact, it annoys me a lot because I'll chuck a grenade and then switch to vats which will auto target the grenade not the enemy.
---
Its to get people to playing it again the numbers can be tweaked
---
If my Fixer that has damage of 190, is hitting a Behemoth in the 150's crouched and stealth, and continues to hit in the 150's standing and non-stealth, I doubt Dr/er be a factor here?
---
maybe he wanted you to play minecraft instead
---
Throwing arc does. Don't know about blast radius.
---
I got kicked out yesterday, crashed to dashboard and came back in and didn’t have any rewards that I know of. I was just walking around getting the ammo before looking at report and nope game froze and dashboard I went. I could be wrong tho maybe I got stuff but nothing new.
---
Jist I got, 
---
legendary run = bad, 
---
2nd season = good 
---
Doubt it. I'm hitting in the 150's rather if I'm crouched and in stealth, or if I'm standing and non-stealth - as the clip shows.
---
As far as I'm aware, this PHASE of daily ops will always have Piercing Gaze as 1 mutation- that's what it was on the PTS.
---
However, it sounds like they're going to do more phases in the future- potentially ones that are focused on being stealthed (maybe super high damage enemies that you want to avoid being hit by?)
---
But no word on how long before the next phase.

I switched from a minigun to a 50cal after the first time I used it.  The minigun with the same legendary effects definitely has superior DPS vs something big and stationary, but the 50 feels much more nimble and responsive.  Tap the mouse/trigger and fire one bullet if you like.  Use a stimpak immediately.  It’s a great, all purpose gun, but other options beat it for specific purposes.
---
I use a 50cal vs 95% of enemies, but it’s great to swap to a gauss mini or LMG vs things like mirelurk queens, sheepsquatch, etc.  If you can manage weight, it’s good to have a small handful of guns for different purposes.  A ye olde gatling or plasma caster is also nice to have for long distance, like when an annoying enemy is shooting you from a balcony or cliff.  If I could only carry one gun, it would definitely be a 50cal.
---
Oh OK I'm surprised I didn't figure that out on my own. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Lol I was at this part of the game a week ago too and it took me a bit to figure how to get back inside it
---
Would think with 3 eyes that they could avoid walking into stuff.
---
i'm not concerned about what damage someone else is doing
---
I often find the biggest complainers know the least about the game, just what they have read and copied.
---
I’m always amazed to read people struggle with collecting resources. Namely were to find them.
---
What was your last Trophy? Mine was Field Medic and Good Grief!
---
They said in the future there’s going to be different “cycles” of ops, and specifically said there’d be ones oriented around stealth (I’m guessing VERY high damage output enemies that you want to kill quickly without them detecting you).
---
Other than that, it’s really thinking about perks vs what the mutations are. For now, swap out anything stealth oriented for tanking perks; and if it’s a Camouflage mutation, dump those VATS cards. Generally Commando is going to be a better fit for the current non-stealth ops, but if you’re a bloodied build with a high damage weapon like a Gauss rifle you can still pull off oneshots (my bloodied stealth VATS rifleman was able to do oneshot body shots with a Gauss rifle, I forget if it was a bloodied or an instigating one, but I was able to run it as a VATS rifleman- but if it’s a Camo mutation, I much prefer Commando)
---
Omg guys I nearly choked on my coffee 😂
---
..and this is still when it’s new, might be impossible later. They may need to think about implementing some sort of matchmaking. 
---
It’s really crippled it depends on having others in your server, wanting to play when you do.
---
It wasn't gone, but now it's more pronounced.
---
Headshots or critical area shots render them useless. If people would just aim for vital points they wouldn't be having these problems
---
I just have some sneak skills on. Crouch to evade and harder to detect. I just start hitting and they never know where I am ane if they see me, jump away and crouch then walk around to them again. 
---
When they're about to detect you they attack randomly but if you move fro  there they still miss. Lured the queen out the nuke zone with my gun and she was spitting and spraying gas in the wrong direction
---
I'll send u a dm on xbox but I have just been stuck looking for empathed serum for the longest time
---
It was the Mothman's wisdom. He passed it on to me when I donated a bunch of firefly fluid. Now, I pass it on to you. Use the knowledge wisely.
---
Mine was Good Grief.  Been playing bounty hunter for the last couple of weeks to get it
---
Now that takes me back.. my first epic weapon in my first mmo was a shoulder mounted plasma cannon. Thanks for the inadvertent nostalgia trip.
---
I scrapped it too. I’ve been here for 2 days thinking ffs these glitches. I also black screened repeatedly trying to go back into a server last night. So I really genuinely thought it was a bug I was getting.
---
They also need to fix the 1st person pipboy light while wearing the mask
---
Grats on your plat also
---
I've been curious about these changes. Would y'all recommend only using the tier one perks for weapon damage and spreading perk points around for more versatility in weapons and defensive perks? I want to experiment but without a respec option it's very limited.
---
I'm on xbox😔
---
If you are not in &lt;danger&gt; while crouched you should be getting bonus damage. If that's not happening id make a video and send a bug report in but don't hold your breath on it getting fixed. 
---
Make sure you are targeting the same body part and roughly the same distance from the enemy. 
---
Sometimes you still don't get the bonus in &lt;caution&gt; but at the least it should 100% work in &lt;hidden&gt;.
---
Why can’t the rug look this good ?
---
I thought it just increased bash damage like in the description?
---
Same. When they were doing the atlas donations, several people on a facebook group I was in complained that concrete is rare and hard to find so they wouldn’t donate shit to the brotherhood. 
---
I responded with “don’t expect resources to be handed to you. This location, this location and this location have tons of concrete and this event also gives concrete. Work for the shit you want.” 
---
I immediately got under fire saying that “it’s easy for someone whose played the game to say that and that the game is hard so finding resources shouldn’t be hard too” 
---
Like just fucking google where to find concrete and it’ll tell you? People are insane.
---
I agree, that's pretty ridiculous tactics. If only Bethesda would balance the good potential of certain builds.
---
If you scroll down that’s in there too but my plan was the get a Vampire’s rifle with Vanguard armor and try to keep myself topped off. 
---
Losing stealth is a major DPS loss but half the time now even with max AGI and the Chinese suit I’m losing it anyway. Plus Ops doesn’t allow it for now either -.-
---
Some men just wanna watch the world scream
---
That has kind of annoyed me a few times. like if the enemy has a minigun and it drops something else, like hey I could have used that steel scrap you ass.
---
I’d love to see the T-65 fixed as well, especially being able to see inside the left arm when using a 50 Cal.
---
I want those pre war house walls and porches but they are atom shop only right?
---
Can you get any clean/whole looking building sets during regular gameplay?
---
When a level 50 gets carried by a level 10 you should. Not because they are doing more damage than you, but because that person going from level 10 - 50 will get that much weaker. It’s the antithesis of good game design.
---
I never understood what the term “magic” means when used to describe a weapon in 76
---
care to share it?
---
I die from the liberator's right outside vault 76 now. Knew I sucked at this game but the new patch makes it to where I can't even play the game anymore. I just don't have the gear to fight level 50+ enemies.
---
The biggest issue with this patch is all my characters were leveled when I was playing NW like a mad man but in adventure mode I'm level 50+ without having even done a single quest.
---
I honestly had fun living in the noob zone building camps.
---
Can't even do that anymore since everything in any zone is my level.
---
I wish the scaling mobs was optional at least in a private server.
---
It seems u realy have an isseu with People asking qeustions because ure litteraly blowing this post out of propportion for me asking other People on reddit if its a thing or not so i suggest for urself to calm down a go play ur game again instead of being so disrespectfull. Im only asking for some info and what other players do with the info i give/ask is up to them.
---
nobody carries me.
---
I haven't tried the robots yet and am a little afraid
---
I have made a video of this, it's the clip I have linked in my post. Abide for the last 4 sec' of the video, I never enter danger. My opening damage on the Behemoth was 163. I stood up. It was one 153. I switch back from crotch and standing to show how inconsistent / nonexistent the damage was.
---
Can sell to vendors 100% for a sizable 24 caps
---
was that you who just slid into my dms?
---
I assume you breathe with your nipples. Teach me
---
Lol which rug?
---
If you want a legendary fixer. Besides buying it from other people, you need to own and LEARN the plan. Once you do that. THEN you’ll have a chance to get them as legendary weapons from the purveyor. 
---
Same with the wastelanders weapons. You need to buy the plan for those weapons with gold if you want to have a chance of getting them from the purveyor. 
---
This applies to the bear arm weapon you can get the plan from project paradise. 
---
Or the tenderizer plan you could’ve gotten from meat week event. I’m sure there might be other weapons but I don’t know them from the top of my head. 
---
If you don’t know the plan for those weapons. You’ll never ever get it from the purveyor.
---
I think it means it can do more damage then what it says. Its a bug I think. I've googled it and read about it and tbh I couldn't tell you how it does it or why but it does it.
---
With your egocentric approach to conversation, I question your ability to notice even if they did.
---
This! I was so confused when I couldn’t drop them
---
I see ~255 in stealth and 155 out of stealth in that clip. Looks fine to me.
---
First couple shots look wrong but after looks fine.
---
The colossus pelt rug . It’s looks nowhere as good as your pick or the taxidermy heads . Awesome pick though !
---
They are, people just complaining to complain as usual. Especially if you headshot, they die almost instantly.
---
don't hate me for spitting facts
---
You can get the fixer plan from encryptid, sheepsquatch weapon plans from free range, bear claw plans from project paradise, glaive plans from daily ops, grognak axe from xmas gifts or mole miner pails,  or search the marketplace
---
I stopped playing yesterday. The game has become too difficult for me.
---
Resilient is so dumb they better completely remove it. Not sure how it made it past pts.
---
Oh! I forgot about that rug. Probably because it’s so ugly and I’ll never use it 🤣
---
If that was the case, you could potentially get all the rare plans within a few days.  
---
This is done so you play more. And you can always trade those extra plans for other plans you don’t have. 
---
I personally don’t have the signs you have. I’ve gotten the BOS outfit. The vault 94 stash box. And the vault 94 jumpsuit. 
---
If I get another one of those, I can always give it to my gf or one of my friends. 
---
I haven’t gotten the plan to build that symptomatic machine. However I asked my friend to build one for me and in return I’d give her one of my BOS outfits. 
---
I’m not too worried or concerned, or in a hurry. I know within a month almost everybody will have most of them unlocked already.
---
Instigating with a decent RoF applies double damage to your first few shots.  The game takes a split second to register what’s happening.  Alternately, instigating can trigger “magic” damage if you have a RoF of 200+ or explosive damage doubling your registered hits.
---
Tenderizer and the Follow Through perk are the same, negatively, with high RoF automatics.  Your second, possibly third and fourth hits don’t apply the bonus damage until the game can catch up.
---
Magic damage works the same.  It’s all tied to packet exchange and latency.  A lot of lag can sometimes get a gun with a RoF less than 200 to start dealing runaway damage.  It’s happened a couple times with my old j/10 50cal, j/10 gatling laser and a j/e 10mm SMG.  It doesn’t happen often, but it can.
---
Yeah I agree
---
I had this once too, pretty annoying.
---
Luckily my team seemed to know where to go.
---
This shit has gotten so bad that when i hop over to buy stuff from a vendor and the persons camp is being attacked i start shooting the enemies to get rid of them and 95% of the time the vendor hops off. Once anyone hears gunfire they assume their camp is being destroyed. Screw those douchebags who made all the vendors on edge
---
It’s hilarious the legs are about 3 feet long .
---
No. Reread what I wrote. Also turn spell check  on.
---
The war glaive from daily ops has really strong potential for two handed builds. I don't know much about 1h but the cattle prod from the settlers faction rep seems well-liked. For unarmed, Power Fist, Gauntlet, Deathclaw Gauntlet, and Bear Arm seem to be all top potentials
---
Thanks. This info helps out a lot, like the rest. Time to grind then.
---
Thanks to all. I figured as much that you had to get them from events. Turns out their plans. Looks like I have to have a war with RNG, lol.
---
You’re spreading misinformation and encouraging people not to have vendors.
---
I don't know that it's working as it's intended to work for lower level players. I've been running around with my 5th character I made last season for easy levelling  to get that challenge done. And, I've been running into LVL 40, LVL 60 mobs pretty frequently at LVL 22.  
---
I put it to the test at Westek and Project Paradise, and in both of those places, the mobs I was facing were way above my level on that character. It could be doing something behind the scenes unrelated to the visually displayed level, since I was able(with many deaths) make it through Westek and take out the mutants with melee fights. But, there was some odd behavior from them, they sort of just stood there and let me hit them in some instances. I was crippling them, and didn't have, to my knowledge anything to cripple them enabled.
---
I also ran Mr. Messenger today with some other LVL 100-150 players, and I was still seeing LVL 30, 40, and 60 mobs. At Project Paradise, I got mauled by a LVL 60 wolf, but I saw quite a few LVL 25 Randstags as well. 
---
I guess the events aren't being subjected to the same level scalling as the regions, perhaps?
---
Aside from the scaling, I feel like every mob in the game has the 'piercing gaze' level of perception from the Daily Ops now, like stealth is just utterly useless no matter where you go.
---
Yes there was a post here where bethesda responded and said that the perk is working as intended. Should be easy for you to find, look up posts with the yellow tag saying bethesda replied.
---
Don’t worry, 0 chance of that happening.
---
If you're asking about the melee weapons themselves, a war glaive for a two handed build (super sledge if you can't find one) and possibly a gutter for 1 handed. If you're asking about legendary perks I would suggest Instigating or bloodied + 40% power attack damage + 1str or 40% less damage while power attacking.
---
I do have the Slug Buster in my Stash.  
---
I haven't used laser/energy weapons much. Do you know what perks affect energy weapons? I can find none and someone mentioned it's the Receiver and name which dictate which ones affect them.
---
Ive tried and it does not
---
Do the SPECIAL legendary perks add perk points allowing you to equip more cards in respective perk tree?
---
Not sure why you capitalize “phase”. The dev team refer to uplink as the first daily ops game mode. We may be saying the same thing lol
---
Magic shotguns still work. I’m still using my bloodied pump shotgun. Even without a suppressor and sneak perks, I can one shot most enemies. If anything, at most I have to shoot them twice. But you need to have an armor piece with the legendary effect “reduce damage while blocking” in order for it to be OP in vats.
---
I'm on track with you except for getting 8:02 for my very first attempt on the first day.
---
No it don't, i have got Elder everyday and I run solo. 
---
Learn the map and all the shortcuts and it's easy.
---
We haven't faced with this problem. Low level character in the group didn't do much damage, I could say opposite, I helped her with almost every monster. At least it worked such way with shotguns.
---
Yeah i really don't know why beth is releasing all this lame and uncool stuff that nobody really wants.
---
I just want a loot all button without entering their full inventory.
---
That is weird, I'll let ya know if I find any more cases like yours
---
So...weirdly enough I was doing a thing where I wound up with about 30 grenades. I was at max caps for the day and just felt like getting rid of them, so I equip, toss one over a rock face, it goes off, damage numbers pop up and I get a ding and some xp. Turned out I killed a ghoul. I'm level 310 so it was probably minimum level 50 and Ive no explosive perks applied. 
---
That being said, if you try that shit on purpose you are guaranteed to fail
---
What system you play on?
---
Skills of course.  
---
No two gamers skills are the same let alone how we approach each enemy.  Is that one of the Legendary perks? My main is only 121 so only has 3 slots open. I'm no fan of grinding so it's best for me if I go in with a group. We're more likely to get the best rank that way.
---
Yeah the 8 cap is deff not enough I think either, i do see why they did it tho, 24 people in there if the whole server showed up would be too much.  But it sucks when the first 8 shows up and the second gets stuck with half that or less.
---
Add in Dodgy and Ricochet and nothing really hurts.
---
Xbox One.
---
I’m really hoping we can build a water source inside for purified water and what not
---
Yup, that's what they are for, but to a max of 15 perk points. So there's that limit, but it's great for getting that extra perk or two you need for your build.
---
Yeah, I'm unimpressed after getting the super reactor as well.  Make it provide 200 power and it would be a  sweet machine.
---
There is no plan for the armor itself. You can buy them one at a time from the Enclave bunker.
---
Have him contact Bethesda support and he will have to unlink and link his account again. It's the only thing that fixed it for me.
---
I have two if you would like to message me so we don’t get in trouble here
---
Sure.
---
I just use power armor when I need radiation resistance and have quad weapons to use for that.
---
Oh god. That's bad. I guess I should thank you for explaining it, but man, it was almost better when it made no sense.
---
I’ve been seeing a lot of Tesla Weapons in events these past days and it seems fine on my PS4 again. 
---
Just a little confirmation from me as well.
---
Toilet's that make a flushing sound
---
If you're on a team. Then the person who didn't build it can move it or even store in it the build menu to use later if they don't know the plan.
---
Yes, I hope today isn't considered 'normal'.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Wow that's actually epic! I'm gonna have to think long and hard and my build. Lately my build was focused on drinking whiskey with charisma perks and a two hand melee build. It's fun and all but limited. Maybe now I can get some Commando action in there too!
---
Well if it's a molotov cocktail build then yes lmfao
---
I have 19 people to kill before Platinum.  But I suck at PVP so it will forever be out of my reach.
---
From what I've noticed lately, robots seem significantly tankier, Mr.Gutsy's ballistic guns do more, full-auto weapons for enemies shred your health, and for the assaultron in the daily ops, its laser tickles in comparison to its mini-guns.
---
So does that mean I, er... They could grief and boot everybody off the team at the last minute?
---
Sweet, er... I mean, Dang.
---
I'm kidding. I mostly play solo and don't join teams so my Lone Wanderer Perk doesn't get all screwy.
---
Added: and I don't play the ops.
---
DPS ..... don’t you mean DPH?  There is no per second with the bow.
---
Solo with 10 mobs coming at you at once .... its a done deal.  Even if you do hit the first one stealth and do “insane damage” as another poster put it, the others are immediately alerted to your whereabouts and ALL stealth and covert perk cards/stacks/bonuses are nullified, leaving you shooting one clunky shot per 5 second intervals.  Unless you get locked in VATS and can’t shoot, cant aim, can’t change weapons, or exit VATS ... so you die.
---
How?  You can’t nuke Flatwoods.  The Forest also caps off at lvl 50.
---
I fully believe you got gang raped, but sadly it was by the gang that the other gangs laugh at.
---
They still work. Part of the glitch is that if it's working non-vats shots will also display high numbers, thought it only actually deals damage that high in vats
---
But if you can shoot something and each of your pellets are saying 20~ dmg instead of 2~ then you know it's working properly
---
Man, yeah that's pretty bad. Lord.
---
Thank you for clarifying that.
---
It's probably going to be a small questline with a faction grind at the end. That's really all I am expecting from it. Hopefully I am surprised.
---
I think this was one that stumped me as well and I believe I even went and looked up an explanation, which was the "hedge hog" one that's already been provided.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tick](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tick) in addition to locations on wiki, there are few of them in the pumpkin farm where you collect the pumpkins for the trick and treat daily quest.
---
Make sure to see how damage perks, like commando, have been affected with One Wasteland before you invest in them my dude
---
Gilman Lumber Mill, below the vault I believe. Server hop a bit and you should get tons of ticks. Haven’t played in a while so if this is outdated then... yea.
---
Stealth sneak attack wanted players
---
 They don't  see ya coming.
---
Kinda ridiculous that the card doesn’t say so explicitly
---
Explosive bait would like a word...
---
It's funny - sometimes it's really noticable  while other gameplays at different times it's no problem....
---
I believe me I know. Being last week I was with 8 ppl and some used Tesla’s and first time I experienced this. I was looting and framed literally went down to pixels. Right before it collapsed I got in my power armor and I could see every pixel on it. So I could imagine what it would be like with the whole server there
---
One sec'. New clip, this one without tenderizer and Follow Thru' one. failed to stay fully hidden on this one but even saw a greater flux in number's.  [Link](https://gameclipscontent-d2003.xboxlive.com/xuid-2533274804633520-private/badea564-b52a-4895-b312-1eac97dd42e3.MP4?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=nG0pUfNEli6dFFFmjznArqkMVMsjbtYfd0rX4tdrckA%3D&amp;__gda__=1600562008_3d8b124afd838d4d566dac8bf4e01389)
---
Have a 3rd clip now, with no VATS and I got the Behemoth to get stuck to ensure the range was more or less the same!
---
Yeah I feel you. 
---
I usually jump from team to team asking if someone wants to join me over the mic. 
---
Eventually someone will give me the thumbs up emote. 
---
But I must say I’m surprised actually. 
---
It’s typically only 1/4 players in the team that actually joins. 
---
Imo they would have much better gain from the casual team if they aren’t doing ops anyway.
---
All of the plans you get from the daily ops can be traded.  Not only that, but if your friend has them, they can build them at your camp for you. 
---
I asked a random person on Reddit to build me the symptomatic thing at my camp and she did. 
---
I asked my other friend to build the solar powered generator at my camp and he did. 
---
It’s really all about luck. Don’t give up so easily. The first 2 days I didn’t get ANY rewards for elder. 
---
Then the next day I got the BOS outfit on my first run. And the second day I got the plan for the vault 94 stash box and vault suit.
---
Grenades are pretty useful inside the Burrows, and anywhere else you're wanting to draw mobs out at.
---
My FIL's cabin. Fucking ticks everywhere. Might as well be a goddamn tick farm.
---
I'm thinking it not worth the points to try and get them maxed out. So maybe just 3 points for one of each card for 30% damage increase? Maybe an Anti-armor or Explosive prefix too.
---
Its the DPS that is the problem .... and the lack of availability of good, legendary, compound bows.  
---
Hard to play at this point.
---
Sorry man. I’m pretty new to using reddit. I had a vampire shotgun that I loved but it was early level. If you’re using a ballistic weapon you really want vampire explosive if you can get it. I ran a sneak, handmade explosive build that held up to everything but radiation rumble. I highly recommend glow sighted over concentrated fire. I would also swap out all your lvl 1 perks in endurance for Ironclad level 5. Actually. It’s pretty necessary for non PA builds. I run lifegiver and ironclad but if I had to choose it’s ironclad. I would get rid of thru hiker to fully level lone wanderer. If your not running bloodied nerd rage isn’t really needed. I would also take Four leaf clovers and better crits over your picks. Essentially, if s perk adds damage, you want it in your build. I’m still trying to get exterminator and some luck perks in myself with legendary perks now. Also, instead of thru hikee have you considered a grocers backpack?
---
Let us know your platform and IGN so we can avoid joining your team.
---
If walking around the Whitespring with a black powder pistol isn’t gimping yourself for memeingful flavor, I don’t know what is.
---
Works as intended for Power Armor only, if it works/heals for normal armor this is a bug and they want to know about it.
---
I actually managed to get my hands on Beckett’s 50cal and it is pretty nice to use!
---
Yeah, that's what I do dude. If anything, just do three 10%'s. AA, Instigating, Vampires are great
---
And vault 76 was *supposed* to have the best and brightest!
---
Gotta craft it from raw violet flux, hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluid. That or you can buy it from someone.
---
Explosive bait doesn’t work anymore. Tested it out with my friend. After spending some time hunting radstag and farming frag mines. We crafted about 20 explosive baits. 
---
I put on demolition expert. Wrecking ball. And grendader. I went to my friend’s camp, we both kept pacifist on, I threw it at her little wooden house with a few decorations. Nothing happened. 
---
We both turned off pacifist. Tried again and nothing happened.  Then we swapped, one of us had it on, while the other didn’t. Nothing happened
---
Yep ... done that.  Miss ONE shot, and you are toast.  The DPS is insanely slow.  And putting ALL your apples in the same basket, build wise, has always been a boring game for me.
---
Yes, they even acknowledged that. I kinda think that is was originally a bug and they decided to leave it, instead of fixing it. And as a result no tooltip on the card.
---
I start the team then jist sit and wait in the mission. 
---
Even after I've completed it ill still hop back in and do it again if my teammates leave and new randoms join.
---
I hope too and Agree with you mate 👍
---
Monster Mash is your friend with this.
---
Definitely need one Vampire. Probably gonna be doing a bunch of theorycrafting over the next week or so lol
---
I've done all the daily ops so far with berserker character without too much of a problem. I do have troubleshooter armor equipped which helps a lot though.
---
Feel you!
---
I solo’d my first op. 
---
Holy shit... I used 60 stims and 2-3k ammo lol. 
---
Maybe going in as stealth rifleman against the resilient robots wasn’t a good idea lol.
---
Yeah, I am curious if our camp interior’s will be completely self-sufficient or will we be dependent on placing some items outdoors
---
I myself got the 94 stash box and two named weapon plans.
---
lol - I’m good with more interactive items
---
swapped stuff maybe 10-12 times since then with no problems. i use the icebox at rusty pick. 
---
i HAVE had problems in the past. 4 or 5 times out of like 500+ times doing it.
---
What level, daily ops are for level 50's to complete, and any level 50 should be able to solo it in 8 minutes unless your fighting off the uplink things..  in which case your losing because your doing it wrong.
---
The OP stated in the very first sentence the person made it all the way to the end of the season, implying they cheated. The OP did not read that folks are able to buy ALL ranks immediately.
---
Why downvote folks when the op assumed incorrectly.
---
When is this coming out?
---
This method was *never* 100% safe, and never intended as a transfering method by bethesda. You see these types of posts by people who have lost items weekly.
---
Only 100% safe way of transfering stuff is by using a friend that you trust or by using a second account you own.
---
Yeah One Wasteland has a lot of players like that, me included. It's kinda exciting in a way, even though the damage nerf kinda sucks
---
Mole rats can get stuck underground. Thats pretty aggravating. Only molotovs and floater grenades can easily get them.
---
Right, I was talking about the " +3 Lockpick and Hacking skills" the level 1 card gives you plus the 3 regular perk cards. So I guess I should have said +6 lock picking skill.
---
It looks like the legendary card doesn't actually say anything about making the sweet spot bigger, so it probably doesn't.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux this will give you most of the information you need including a map of what flora will turn violet when nuked
---
There's also a chance for Scorchbeast Queen and Earle to drop random Flux, but your best bet is figuring out where to go in nuke zones. Raw Flux can spoil so consider Good With Salt when hunting for it
---
I did it earlier and had no problem. Sorry
---
There's a spot a bit SSW of Harper's Ferry, west of the red rocket stop. Just about where the "108" is on the map. I believe it's an unnamed location but there are usually 2-4 ticks outside the building and several more inside.
---
At the moment it’s just “Nov-Dec” - likely patch 24 I’m thinking
---
I welcome the changes to damage. Even though I haven't tried it yet, it was boring running around some of my favorite zones and everything being weak as hell. I love a challenge.
---
I have a full set of troubleshooters armor 3* I put the first suit together from vending machines for about 5k for all 3* scout armor. I've been slowly replacing it with SS when I roll one. It's well worth it.
---
Make a mule character to horde
---
Yeah, haven’t been able to play since the update. Get anywhere from instant disconnect to 5 minutes of gameplay before disconnect.
---
I wouldn’t mind having a VE Handmade, I may already have one. Gotta check my mules. However I’m under the impression some perks like Limb damage will increase damage like EX would.
---
I left Nerd Rage on just as a heads up for “hey, stim bruh”.
---
I’m not super concerned about using Iron Clad when I’m going to do Secret Service armor.
---
And the backpack I was planning on Armored vs. the Grocer mod.
---
Yes, it's a legendary perk.  I only have it at level 1 and it makes assaultrons do literally no damage to me.  But it only works in power armor
---
Simply call out "hey man u got some stimpacks" into the ether and 5 level 300s will show up to unload 250lbs of healing items on you
---
Junkies and the alcohol addiction?
---
If they're in a vending machine, what "category" would they be under, if I'm seaching vendor camp sites?  would they be counted as meds, or Misc, or something else?
---
I bet you got it second try though, right?  Tbf, I had practice in the pts.
---
I thought this was an easy platinum? Just under two months for me. Got it reaching level 100.
---
F in the chat for the resources spent repairing
---
I remember in PTS, people would routinely brag about 6 minute solo times.  But on live, I couldn't possibly beeline faster or spend more time in front of the beacon, and I'm nearing 4 minutes by the time the first beacon clears.  It doesn't matter how well you've "learned the map."  It takes a certain amount of time to do the beacons (we don't see a hard number, so for all we know, it lags), and short of having teammates all standing in the radius, there's nothing you can do to speed that up.
---
Sure didn’t accidentally log back into an open world server? I’ve done that by mistake before and logged in thankfully.
---
Must have pacifist off for it to work
---
Huh whats that? Sorry I lack basic knowledge of FO76
---
Why ignore they already finished the season. The devs put out in the patch notes ranks can be bought from day one.
---
You assume they cheated, that is why you made that first sentence...."Okay we'll ignore that somehow someone was already FINISHED the Season." Then the OP adds in "Probably exp stacking", also assuming. never taking into consideration they paid the atoms for the ranks as the devs stated they could from day one.
---
Folks are getting downvoted for correcting you and you are the one that is wrong.
---
Why abuse the AI like a boring potato when you can stare into it's eyes as you put a round in the gas tank knowing full well only one of you is wlaking away from that.
---
Fallout 4, a game for a more civilized time
---
I suggest everyone that wants to be pacifist checks to be sure they still are btw. I've always been pacifist and it was somehow turned off this week.
---
positive.
---
(and not four times in a row LOL)
---
I've never been able to place a full camp blue print. 99.9% it's not going to work
---
I get that idea, but it makes total sense why you can't drop most Gold Bullion crafts like Gauss weapons/SS armor. That stuff means a person actually put time into the game so they keep value.
---
Floater grenades, backpacks, and other minor rep/gold crafts should be at least tradable though.
---
I like to open up with a big dick round, and then switch to a .44. 
---
To be fair, the entirety of Gunslinger is gimping yourself. 
---
Plasma throwers don't count, I don't care if it's still a pistol, that's a flamethrower.
---
Did great yesterday and the day before. Got just a bit over 8 minutes the first time, under the 2nd. Nailed them both. Can't get even 1 person to run it with me today :(
---
He's not your bro, amigo.
---
The only thing different about the old lvl 5 radroach and new lvl 50 version is the 0.  You can still kill it with a gun bash.
---
Mole rats are still pretty weak, but definitely more bothersome than they used to be.  They also seem slightly more common than before.  I don’t think they should be eligible for lvl 100.  Level 50, at max.  They’ve always served as low grade trash enemies, in every Fallout game.  Radscorpions still fill the niche for obnoxious, harder to kill, burrowing enemies, if some sociopathic dev insists on it.  We don’t need more of that.
---
Of everything I’ve fought, I’ve only noticed ticks being one type of enemy that used to be easy to kill with a backup knife, but now require some bullets to kill.
---
Just another character on your same account. Just to hold extra gear
---
You have to have Pacifist OFF in order for this to bug work.
---
Pretty easy just took a long time for me
---
If you do have an explosive it’s worth considering adding demolition expert for +60% damage fully leveled. Since both my main weapons are explosive it’s worth it to me. I run buttressed SS armor and I still get wrecked. Even with Ironclad. I have tried to add as much dt as possible. I really don’t want to wear power armor but sometimes I think it’s the only way.
---
Yep, 7:42. I dun goofed on a few things on the first run. One minor annoyance was that I held the button too long when repairing the beacon which caused me to exit my Power Armor.
---
Because I don’t feel like getting a perk like that when 90% of the time I’m alone. I only join for the XP boost.
---
Probably scrip the legendaries you don't use or plan to use.
---
I’m a bit out of the loop. How do you get this outfit?
---
This has happened like for the past i don't know 10 years or so. But not a bad thing you can farm them for scrips. It is not like getting meat and tato requirements any harder than breathing irl.
---
Same, it's so Annoying
---
The Centaur from past games would like to have a word...
---
Tesla is rifleman or commando, if you go semi or auto. Go auto.
---
Not that it matters, with one wasteland, my fixer doesn’t do enough damage to even pull out anymore.
---
you NEED 1 gun fu. 
---
i'd drop aquaman tbh
---
I know everything got nerfed. But I keep seeing videos and posts about commando sneak builds still killing things easily.
---
Oops that link isn't up to date... Sorry
---
Funny
---
Unfortunately PA has an innate resistance, so even matching PA for DR isn’t enough. So the idea for me is to stay out of melee range lol
---
I haven’t used Demolitions since they nerfed it due to the fact they break much faster.
---
Don't ever try to transfer anything. The game has a tendency to rollback and lose your items.
---
Im trying but either I dont play at all or I play so much that I get more than I can sell
---
Thanks for the clarification.  
---
However, I have not used energy weapons and doubt I have the ammo for it. I do have the ammo maker.
---
Wastelanders was a solid 3 hours of content, surely they can't introduce less than that.
---
username checks out
---
B-but your positively glowing... I'll help :),  jokes aside me and my gf only did that to a bloodied who one shot everything in events and wouldn't leave cause of the lvl 3 insperational and lvl 4 carry weight perks being shared...even the low level joined in and shared canibal... God my musupial hates that lol
---
Yes, atom shop BUT this is not that, this is an already in game house that's got some "issues". I do have that set but didn't use it here. This house is by the nuka cola plant along the river. I'd say the cleanest in game walls/building parts are the barn, brick and metal building sets. When I say metal I mean metal not the aluminum siding shack with holes in it etc. lol not sure what they're actually called in game.
---
There are a lot of in game building and campgrounds you can place your CAMP at. Check out this person's videos they have most of 'em I think but it's probably a bit outdated. - https://www.youtube.com/c/gamerMOMover50/search?query=camp%20locations
---
How could I trade items between them? Only one can be online or is there a way around?
---
I'm not a PA user in either of my characters.
---
About as bad as telling a guitar player that they'll always drop their "good" picks and lose them to the floor void.
---
We need a "Wanna do OPs?" emote.
---
Have someone help you move them. There's plenty of people on the trading sub that are happy to help
---
One would think that some spiky glow that shows above the plants or grass for that particular player (not everyone else) would be a standard thing and we not need mods to do the job that devs should have done in the first place. The flies are hard to see and many meat/ash piles simply do not sit on the ground properly.
---
The problem with a Shotgun build is that you may not be a melee build, but you you are quite close to it ! I mean you are going for close range combat. Having a great defense is important. I'm running a Bloodied Shotgun build on this alt character ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1773f8&amp;d=sd2so2sp2sg2sf2p00ej4eh1c72cm2ir2a72as2a12am2l71la2a02lt2&amp;w=lg2au2lu2e31c13&amp;m=c24fe3&amp;am=172a38-172a38-172a38-172a3a-172a3a&amp;wp=w9&amp;wm=142036 ) But if i'd had to go for a Junkie build i'd change just a few perk cards here and there...and honestly this build here with a few change could definitely do even better in a Junkie build in my opinion. 
---
- With hope it inspire you ✌
---
Did you see the tree house village? The npcs got no dialogues to say to you. That is the lowest bethesda has ever gone.
---
I don't know about that many stims and I don't think the Op tracks that kind of thing. It was on my alt who is 56 and I haven't tried with my main who is 121 but a Rifleman not Commando.
---
Make a new character so u can store stuff on so ur main character doesnt get overweight,  have a trusted buddy help u transfer those items your not using on your main character. If u dont have a buddy to help u transfer im pretty sure u can find a verified courier to help u transfer or someone with a high amount of karma.

A few spots haven't been updated since wastelanders and no longer spawn mutants (like the model home, flooded train yard).  When I was doing a legendary run and it felt like I had a hot server (aka lots of the same god prefix drops) I liked to expand my runs vertically rather than just server hop. Folks will say it's just RNG but to me it FELT like certain servers are predisposed to dropping similarly rolled legendaries.
---
I don't have a YouTube channel perse (aka I barely do any content) but this is a video I did as well.
---
https://youtu.be/qcwUX6C9BMc
---
Ill do that. Thanks alot. I appreciate it!
---
At least you’re willing to use late 19th century technology with a revolver.  That’s a step towards sanity.
---
People love to cut in front of me while im doing it and holding a also makes you leave power armor so it always kicks me right out of my armor, I also had one do it to me on an uplink and as soon as I got out of my armor I got shredded lol
---
Of course I planned on running SS armor with Vanguard. I'm a long way to swapping over as I need more pieces still but so far I got 3 and I'm just leveling up to grab all the perks too.
---
Yeah. My handmade had to be repaired pretty often even with gunsmith 5. My gauss minigun holds up pretty well though. The only reason I switched off my handmade was because esp w/demolition expert if I shot anything relatively close to my I killed myself. So every time a ghoul rushed me was bad. Had to go big gun to keep up with mobs. Post patch, only my minigun keeps up with mobs.
---
Fair enough.  That's just what I did.  Ymmv and you may find something else you prefer
---
Use commando.

This is what I run and it works beautifully

No it doesn’t track that. You’re right.

I just know I went in with 60 stims and got out with 0 haha.
---
It's never been 100% foolproof, unfortunately.  Just the only solo option we have, given that Bethesda refuses to implement a proper transfer box for god-knows-what reason.
---
I don't believe I've attempted to transfer something since Patch 22, so I'll be mindful of this.
---
There have been some rumors that the entrance to the interior might but a vault type entrance. However, I am hoping that the entrance to the interior can be attached to a regular door.
---
Found it, its at crater bullion vendor some price around 1200 gold bullions
---
There's a lot more than it looks. I scrapped everything except what I absolutely needed. My perk inventory is practically empty and I still have 125 unequipped perk ranks. That's 3-7 perks per SPECIAL stat because those max rank 3 tier and 5 tier perks add up. If you're trying to save max rank of every perk, you definitely have close to 600 spare perks.
---
It's triggered by Taking One for Team.
---
Definitely not enough
---
For the love of god, please, yes.
---
Edit: I still have a toon that can't drink, eat, or do anything but destroy items in the inventory because they're overloaded.  I just logged in one day and couldn't pick anything up, not even caps, and just stopped playing.
---
I went the opposite route. I used to use 1x of each Commando and Rifleman perk, and carried both an automatic rifle and a LAR for sniping.
---
Since the patch, I've found the LAR just wasn't cutting it (it could still one-shot some things, but it fired too slow for any combat with more than 2 enemies), so I spec'd wholly over to 3x3 Commando, and went full in on my automatic build. (I suppose if I had really wanted to stay a sniper I could have gone 3x3 Rifleman, but with VATS *also* broken Commando is just easier.)
---
Honestly, it just works better. Things die harder now, so increasing your damage is a good move. And I'm actually having a bit more fun overall; I can still fit some utility into my build, and the extra damage means that the OWL changes don't feel quite as rough.
---
It aint magic im using quad pump it also one or two shots everything in vats
---
"Hand it over, that thing...your T H I C C ass..."
---
"Delicioussss"
---
/shudder
---
On a related note, mind if I caption that?
---
How is it going with pistols? If I ever move away from rifles I’d do that next.
---
Hey....thats my spot, get your own
---
They threw a ton of grenades and shot down my walls and roof
---
Store and replace her item?
---
It’s literally down to the wire each time solo due to the speed of the beacons at 1x. It’s not that easy. You’re saying you solo’d it first day of the patch at elder? My first try I solo’d it at 12 minutes
---
It is how reddit gaming communities work bro. "I spent $20 dollar on this game so that means the devs and the people involved in this game are instantly a level below me. They do something I don't like? I can instantly enraged and call them incompetent,  impotent, failure etc etc" and they can't do anything about it. In fact, everytime I do it, the community applause me for it although I have no idea how game development process work or even the things I'm complaining about.
---
True. I alternate bt the two, non pa or pa
---
I know some people complain about their unarmed bloodied build and dying more meanwhile my death rate hasn't really changed that much and if anything I get way more stimpacks from like 1 or 2 daily ops runs. Of course people are complaining they have to pick up stuff.
---
Borderlands 1 has this SAME thing.  You get killed by someone using a cool ass rifle that shoots lightning? well if you manage to kill him then you get to pry that same cool ass rifle that shoots lightning from his hands.  Bs they don't have that here considering it was in other fallouts.
---
Already tried
---
I've only paid cursory attention to the whole camp instance interiors, so bear with me. Where does this leave those of us that have built "houses"? Are the instanced interiors limited to upcoming prefab buildings? ELI5, please. I worked really hard on my camp but am at max budget; I am excited about an increased camp budget but don't want to lose my house.
---
The three at the hunter shack attack me everytime and they don't do much damage and I kill them every time. And I'm 110. Fix your build or put on some armor, because ticks should not be killing you.
---
Yea but if you're dual wielding pistols in Warframe, you're meme.
---
Thank you, new to reddit and didn't realize this.
---
my two shot shotgun seems to suck more than it should as well. I was excited until I used it a few hours and now it’s stashed
---
Ain't that a kick in the head (sorry I had to)
---
Yeah, I'm upset that my unarmed bloody melee and junkie's commando took such a big hit, but I need to rework my builds anyways. Just sucks that all of the time I spent working on both builds is gone LOL.
---
Ha ha ha
---
They work pretty well in the daily ops since the enemies always cluster up.  Great way to get rid of the 20+ pounds I build up a day.
---
Shishkebab and Black Powder pistol, and MIRV grenades. I want to be Gangplan, yarr harr fiddle dee dee
---
There’s some fun alcohol related cards
---
But if they don't make their own post, they don't get their validation and acknowledgment.
---
Shame your post was removed.
---
Who cares the amount of time you spent on it? Just go to your CAMP table and repair it all.
---
Lol, I was more thinking about the colors in the photo, but sure
---
Sorry about that. Didn't realize it was that rare as I only knew it existed by getting the mask. Also wasn't asking for a handout, was going to pay caps for it. Have 21k.
---
Thank you for the help.
---
What two mutations are you looking for specifically?
---
People don't know how to sprint to the objective and heal through the attacks. Keep being 5 seconds off all because we can't get there together. The freezing is really challenging lots of players it seems.
---
Rad roaches and mole rats should not take more than a bullet to kill if I'm level 108 and using a tse handmade, I'm fine with everything else tbh it's just the week enemies that can now kill me that piss me off
---
Satan: Calm down there you black void.
---
The traditional route is to fast travel to vault 76, hit the moonshiners shack and then go to gillman's lumber. There is more at Dolly sods if you don't mind a few Yao Guis.
---
This method is outdated. You get heaps of stimpaks from human enemies. Lucky hole mine will give you quite a few. Even this method is now outdated as the daily ops are giving you so many chems you will eventually have to start dumping them once you have exhausted the robot vendors.
---
First time I couldn’t finished a daily solo.
---
