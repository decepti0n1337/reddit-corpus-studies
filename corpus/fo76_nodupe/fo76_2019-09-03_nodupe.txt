fwiw I tried 4 times on pub server, switched to a private server (fo1st) and it worked first time. All doors were closed obviously. So maybe it works once on a fresh server, then bugs out.
---
---
---
Why is it spoiling anything? It makes visiting camps more exciting IMO
---
“Close my CAMP door”

Out of curiosity, are you a FO1st member?

Thanks for the reply, much appreciated.
---
I hate Fortnite also...
---
YOU LOOK ULTRACITE
---
Lol I’m thinking of my house on the river that would assuredly flood multiple times a month. Looks cool tho
---
I know you can pull anything you've stored in the scrap box out but not put stuff back in it if not subbed. Can you put stuff in your scrap box?
---
I use a Vampires Ultracite Gatling Laser as  a daily driver. I take two power plants on the weekends and have enough fusion cores to blast away all week with the power user perk...
---
I do this often. I feel like it rewards more xp?
---
I'm level 300 and assaultrons can still be a pain in the ass to deal with. There are two that spawn in silos right next to a door you need to lockpick when you're taking the power armor shortcut, and if they notice you while you're picking the lock their lasers make quick work of any bloodied toon.
---
When Wastelanders came out, the warhawk was in there for a week. After that, it was back to this crap for weeks on end. Just put the damn warhawk in there, Bethesda! It was already in the game for FO4, dammit.
---
The Ammo machine is definitely one of the top rewards, it makes ammo out of thin air, no materials input, you just return to your camp and empty it a few times a session
---
People price things in vendors currently with the cap limit in mind. 7x limit means less restrictions on how much people can charge.
---
K
---
Commenting because I would like to know as well.
---
It would also be awesome if they made more uniques like the Avenger minigun or the Red Glare rocket launcher!
---
If you get stuck doing emote  switch to photo mode will fix it
---
Top tier strategy: Be a bloodied stealth commando with a good fixer and solo him in under 5 minutes.
---
You should be sad about it. If you consider that a win, or a “haul” then that means you are destitute. And that is sad.
---
Thanks for sharing this. It confirms it's not broken (which is good), BUT it also confirms the 5 points can be better spent on other INT perks.  For the little difference it makes in weapons degrade, I'm better off just using the piles of repair kits I've got stockpiled.
---
I don't understand low levels ruining ACP. I can solo him in about a minute. If a low level shows up I'll yell at them to tag wendigo spawns and really enjoy watching them level up as,I wipe them out after. Then I kill Earl at the end.
---
Mine was standing far away from his radio, in a corner of my house on the other end of the build area. Even when changed the server. I slightly moved a chair that was close to his radio a bit away from it and he was immediately walking back.
---
Depends on how you play. On my commando, I unlocked secret service armor and jetpack. Then I unlocked dirt tiles and ammo machine. I unlocked the gauntlet, and I often wonder why. On my pa tank, I was saving up for t65 power armor and gauss minigun, but then I got bored with him. On my other characters, I decided not to grind reputation or bullion.
---
Maybe shoot 'em in da head?
---
Amusingly, it's much lighter to do that for a heavy gunner than it is to carry a melee weapon!
---
True, I didn't think about it that way.
---

---
May I ask what your thoughts are on the other two suggestions about scrip and gold?
---
Use melee build and save up all ammo found.
---
I sacrifice super mutants to Poundcake, the bloodied power fist goddess.
---
why don't you ask someone from "The couriers fallout 76 XBOX” group on Facebook =0
---
it is cripple chance. "magic" weapons with it have to be upwards of 186 dps
---
Ask him.
---
Shields would be badass. That and a 2handed sword
---
There’s a perk called damage?
---
You mean Fixer Skins right? :/  :(
---
Now that it has been pointed out to you how stupid vendoring serums is you are quick to say that you don’t do it yourself, after making arguments for doing so. 
---
So you are either backtracking and are ashamed of how stupid you are, or you never believe it was a good idea and made arguments for doing it anyway. 
---
Tell me which one of those you think is less dumb?
---
I’m so tanky.
---
I can take an Assaultron’s ray to the face!
---
Because this guy in trading with wants to rush me to join the Facebook group to use a courier of his choice
---
Nice one. Thank you.

unless its a shotgun for some reason
---
Make a heavy weapons toon. I run a BE15r gatling gun for run of the mill enemies, a BE15r gatling plasma for running west tek, and a B2515r ultracite gatling laser for the sbq and earle. I haven't had to craft 5mm ammo for the gatling gun once since I got it, plasma cores are cheap and everywhere, and I don't use the gatling laser enough to really need to worry about making fusion cores. I actually transitioned over to ultracite ammo for it just because I use them up so slowly.
---
The absence of needing gunpowder is sweet
---
*cries in long hair*
---
i do have a "legacy" 2 shot pipe rifle with it and it seems to do mad damage
---
Earle gently lifts his head at the rumbling sound, but upon realizing it's not at his front door he goes back to sleep, gangling arms clutching a plushie of himself.
---
Just shoot the motherfucker. No need to get AI path technical with him......
---
“Unfair treatment” Hello straw man, we meet again.

I never said that I sell them myself. Therefore, there’s nothing to backtrack. 
---
Sharing an in-game option isn’t the same as ***encouraging or endorsing*** the option. 
---
I never defended anyone going to workshops to attack other players. I said that it was a part of the game design. 
---
I never called anyone dumb for not selling serums to NPCs. I pointed out that it was an option. 
---
You clearly have a chip on your shoulder and are easily triggered when someone has a different point of view than you. And to justify that, you make up things to fill in the gaps and get offended by things that weren’t said. 
---
You make assumptions to justify your defensiveness. 
---
You have my pity and sympathy. That must be a very frustrating way to exist. 
---
I hope what ever hurt you mentally or emotionally heals soon.
---
I engaged in pvp in a designated pvp area.  I lived and the other guy died.  Spoils go to me.  That's called a win.
---
On the one hand, in a Fallout Universe I understand weapon durability being a thing because of the age and condition many of the weapons have been left in. But 76 its a little too early for them to be THAT ruined, and use of perks should increase the durability to nearly unbreakable to show the players skill in correctly using, cleaning and maintaining their weapons!
---
Blocking player from session should stop them from joining, not sure if it actually does just saying it should.
---
gotta be level 25 for the plan to appear. and sometimes they have it and sometimes they don't.
---
If you're on xbone i can make you a level 25 and mod it all up nice.
---
Are you telling me running around screaming like a school kid, while trying not to get torn apart by the wendigos, while also trying to maintain a bead on Mr. Three-Face IS NOT a good strategy?
---
Are ypu doing vats or aimed shots?
---
Swapping weapons when stuck will also break the animation and free you
---
I don’t know who that is
---
I have no hypocrisy. You’re the one that made false claims and failed to provide supporting evidence. You’re the one that jumped to a faulty conclusion.
---
Look at you being logical and trying to suggest something to make the player experience better, next you'll be trying to say that the targeting reticule should default to the last position you died in on the map or something crazy like that.
---
+Limb damage only speedup the crippling process, it doesn't add any damage.
---
Cheers. Glad to help
---
At least yours has a door! My red rocket garage has never seemed to have a closeable door.
---
It is explained during the nuke tutorial at the whitesprings bunker that unless you have an escort in the silo that security will be hostile.
---
With a dry interjection from Modus that it's unlikely there will be any escorts still alive.
---
Nice. I like that idea. It would be better if the doors just shut after use.
---
Don’t dance. Lol.
---
I don’t really care about those limits tbh. I rarely bump against either except sometimes scrip and then I just do something else in the game.
---
AMEN!
---
My suggestion... and I don’t know this Arthur person ... is if someone is rushing to do Trade... **Red Flag** If someone says use this **specific** courier only... **Red Flag**
---
Can confirm
---
You can inspect from the favourites wheel and then repair from there
---
Agree!  I thought it was broken because I would expect a MUCH better degrade of weapons than what is shown in the pictures.  For 5 points?  It should last 5 times longer than without.
---
But where they at tho !?
---
Fair enough.
---
Thank you, take care!
---
Yesterday I got "I heard you got drunk and missed the exiting of the vault. Too bad the same didn't happen when it opened."
---
Best one yet.
---
Would love a device or option to just naturally close all doors at once. Set it to auto after so much time passes
---
I went from having 100 to having 50,000 with the display dupe that was patched long ago.
---
Bloodied
---
Unless you hit multiple targets at once, or in a short amount of time.
---
Where would that be? Even a rough area if you want to make us work to find it.
---
People who loot spawns instead of helping kill earl are awful tho :/ Had a run in with a team of 4 level 100+ players who didn't do a single point of damage to the dude and revived nobody. We lost the event with a quarter of earl's health still remaining. Very frustrating night for me and the boys.
---
I still can't figure that out other than to decision people have no clue about the player base. We'll try to sell a fat man skin but not one for the most popular gun in the frigging game.
---
I'll feed them through the ammo converter if they talk shit to me 😂😂😂
---
And it’s part of the game design. Anyone that has a problem with that should complain to Bethesda and/or play a different game.
---
Oh lord I would kill for some new hairstyles, Make up, and tattoos. I feel like those should of been the logical thing to add right after clothes.
---
Can the pair of you either take this to DMS or stop arguing, this is silly there's no need to be at each others throats.
---
Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator Power Armor for lead ore. Tanagra Town for the crickets, which drop Acid. Acid both smelts the ore and can be half of gunpowder, if you need it to be.
---
If you don't already have Excavator Power Armor, there are signs around the Ash Heap that will point you to Garrhan Mining Headquarters and give you a quest that culminates in crafting the armor for yourself.
---
This is why we need an emote of the Vault boy shoving his own head up his ass.
---
K well too late now
---
Yeah I’m level 41, I keep server hopping hoping to find it but no dice
---
Honestly its been over a year since I found it, I want to say the ash heap but I'm not positive
---
It takes less than 5 minutes if you know the optimal path
---
I dont think that would work for most outfits
---
I’ve said my piece.  My apologies for hijacking your thread.
---
Just save up like 30 levels and transition over. What's your current toon?
---
Too late
---
Plan: Red Flag...  Drops from the You're About To Get Screwed event.
---
😂😅 BOS likes em thic
---
I currently live southeast of Morgantown. It’s a nice spot that only occasionally requires me to skip servers. I do good business, but I think my cheap prices do most of the selling for me.
---
The camp almost got nuked a couple of days ago when someone decided to drop a bomb on the city. (They should have put it down a bit further northwest to get the airport too.)
---
No I do I just have to craft it again.
---
X01 is way cooler
---
My hot rod x01 is awesome
---
The ticket system is useless, they either ignore them or auto lock them these days... I've taken to publicly spamming their Facebook and twitter to draw attention to bugs after they lock my tickets!
---
It has a “legendary” effect
---
I always run campfire tales when it pops up. I don't need the backpack plans and they're worth p much nothing these days, it's just fun to do and I've always done it a lot.
---
Hopefully it works for yah hah
---
The point of Steamcharts not being the best indicator is valid; I still play from the Bethesda client. I just have conviction that the trend may be similar on other platforms. I also agree with a move away from dailies is not going to make or break the game. 
---
From my perspective, the seasons and dailies were supplemental to the gameplay content. It kind of made the end game loop less monotonous for some of the people I played with, but not by much. As for the atom shop, my purchases have been more on impulse than being impressed.
---
So how do I get rid then?
---
I’d be good with new stuff too - just thinking it would be cool if some of it was part of the “matched set”.
---
lol for real. I love going on wendigo duty with my shotgunner
---
Definitely fair
---
I play on PS4 and I've never even seen an issue with Teslas. So i assume it must be an Xbox issue. I hate the PC users that whine that their game is buggy and it's definitely not the 2000 different and conflicting mods they're trying to run.
---
I really wish the enemies would respawn after a time like in ESO or Destiny 2.
---
Events are odd because sometimes there will be half a dozen or so coming and going for a good hour, and then other times there is like one or two per hour. It's very inconsistent/laggy/buggy or something. More frequent and consistent events would be nice, along with enemy respawns.
---
That’s an immediate no. Rushing and requesting specific couriers are both huge red flags. I would definitely not engage.
---
Ah yes glitching through walls &gt;.&gt;
---
I also love CT! It's fun and pretty low-hassle.
---
xbox?
---
Gonna have to wait a whole hour for that food to reheat.
---
Sadly this does nothing but turn their character model gray and you be unable to shoot at them like a per person Pacafist, it doesn't stop them from doing anything to you or the servers from matching you to their servers!
---
Is it a legendary fixer or a normal one , if it's a normal one just drop it , if u are trying to learn mods for it scrap combat rifles
---
If it's 2 handed out of power armor it's 2 handed in power armor.
---
I prefer calling it creative walking
---
Can I Count on you to join?
---
I feel ya. It's not a quick event. I like doing it but don't always have the time.
---
Sell or drop, my dude
---
Good stuff
---
Yeah begging them to stay is like falling right into their trap
---
Probably just drop it then
---
Aimed, not a fan of V.A.T.S
---
I think I read that it's just a visual bug? My SPECIAL scores were unchanged even though the Pipboy effects text made it look like Class Freak wasn't working. You shouldn't need to re-equip anything.
---
Gratz On rockin that bish out yo!!
---
I could never,my build isn’t that good,but I really appreciate those of you who are able to do this.
---
Sell it to a vendor, or in your vendor.
---
I'm sore all over.
---
Your comment has more upvotes then the post does 😐
---
PC
---
When they brought down the servers for survival they reported less than 100 people on them at the time. PvPers not playing the mode killed it...
---
A level 50 one moves quickly for 100 caps on Xbox
---
Can't say I disagree. Spam them by any means necessary.
---
I think it should count as a pistol aswell, give us like a 2 stocks that turn it into a uzi.
---
Adding to that remove the auto pistol perks and make it just one pistol perk tree like in NW.
---
It would help kinda I also make tons of ammo. But also super duper perk might get messed up as a whole. At least I think it would
---
Why?you never see the tattoos.and who cares about a hairstyle.that is just stupid.i would tather have new eapons armors and skins that look like i live in the wasteland.
---
I usually say buy, don't let the door hit you on the ass on the way out.
---
So, i know it does count critical shots out of vats, even though it does show it. Should try concentrated fire with hitting the limbs. Might show better what it does.
---
It’s a level 30 one, I just made a level 40 so I don’t need it anymore
---
There is no snow in the game.
---
It won't fix the problem but hopefully draw enough player attention to apply more pressure.
---
Guess I just don’t have any friends.  I only pay for fo1st  for the scrap box
---
Less than 5 min.
---
I wouldn't risk it,no doubt. Claim them monday 7.
---
Secret service armor is also worth getting if you don’t use PA. It can make getting a good legendary roll easier if you don’t like trading and it’s the best armor in the game for now.
---
It's ash but it looks a lot like snow (and accumulates a lot like snow) beth is pretty meh with their textures
---
Ah yeah, just sell that at a train station or drop it in front of one for a lvl 30
---
My best time is 4:42
---
U home?
---
I think it's fine, the issue is damage should also factor into the durubilty loss.
---
More damage should mean your gun runs hotter so automatically weapons will break easier.
---
This is the 3 story building with the armor station in the basement and now have robots in it. Its the building where you climb fallen shelves and duct to get to the safe.
---
Have you tried stealth commando? I am a junkies stealth commando build and I will tell you this, while my damage output isn’t QUITE as good as bloodied it’s honestly right on par with bloodied. I solo’d Earl with my build. And you don’t have to worry about health/rads, etc. Find you a good junkies fixer and become an addict and I promise it will change your life.
---
So any idea how + 50% limb damage and rank 3 tormenter work together?
---
You got a way to skip the launch prep too.
---
That’s awesome and also some dedication. Maybe I’ll lag past you one day. Cheers!
---
Ahhhhh I do not know...was just gonma walk in and shoot everythingvthat moves....slightly confused on the bio card...is that if you domt have a nuke key card?
---
Back On The Beat. I fucking love walking that robot around Morgantown. No idea why.
---
Also, I put the Spooky Wraith Scarecrow in my camp and have to hit the "spoooky" action every time I pass it.
---
That intricate walkway through those tree has toy wood blocks that spell "Danny B". I have a screenshot of it in game.
---
Launch prep is quicker than it feels
---
I haven't noticed that happening, but I also only use the Pearly Peepers if I need a recon scope.
---
Me neither. The thing that I like about the private server is that I’m able to run a few workshops at once without having to deal with pvp fuckery. I’m not as good as some players who are able to get all running at once and will spend a bit of time rotating through to maximize loot
---
I thought they patched the server hop refresh, it doesn't work at whitesprings, or fissure prime anymore.
---
nah, you'll always need a keycard. there's just a barrier at the beginning that you need to make a bio card to be able to cross
---
Its brain is human. Humans are susceptible to scorched plague, brains are no exception. That’s my excuse anyway.
---
Avatar tattoos that glow xD
---
I take it this is a console thing? Never had any problems on steam. When I joined back when the steam version launched a high level guy came over and dropped a bunch of ammo, medicine and mutation serums. Me and my buddy were greatful and just kept giving him hearts and salutes.
---
Explain scorched mirelurks 👀
---
I use to play Star Wars The Old Republic and I remember that when we entered in an "event such this we have to pick a role like healing, tanking, damage... Something like this. And the best we performed on that role, the best our rewards from the event. I really likw this concept.
---
I personally wish they'd give us more exclusive emotes
---
Hell ya. Something that you hit with but it also can block ranged attacks so you don’t get insta killed in pvp. You can have god damage but not god damage reduction against another god. You may be tanky against most npcs but you’ll be one to two shotted by a bloodied bastard.
---
I went from one photo of my backside to 50,000 of them using a similar glitch.
---
Okay thank you!
---
Power armor is still one shotted by players.
---
I will blow through Blackwater mine and waddle out with all the weapons, even better if Uranium Fever is running, but not entirely necessary, cook up at the meat gained for food later,sell the weapons to the vendor at WSS, scrap all the junk. Usually do this a couple of times a day while waiting for friends to do a silo run, keeps up the cap level, and spare scrap is always a good thing.
---
Launch enough you miss one, it happens ;-)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Happens to us all when we get older. Aim is the second thing to go.
---
Nice.
---
I’m sure that would be too OP and everybody would complain although it sounds awesome. I’d be happy with it being very defensive and a good enough melee weapon as it is.
---
You know what would make sense? Even if it was just BoS style army haircuts for now. Is a Hairdresser in the ranks of the BoS when they arrive for new recruits. Lol..
---
Obvious won't happen though. For some reason they can't even think of the smallest stuff like that.
---
Nice
---
Yeah I got two, both asking for 50 cal ammo and when I said no one of them threatened to delete my character
---
Every. Event. I. See.
---
Oh look at Mr. Moneyebags over here...
---
The real question is when we get more Enclave stuff in the game.
---
Shoot em in the leg.
---
To be fair though the SCORE autocompletion is annoying and the best way to stop the posts would be if Bethesda just fixed it.
---
I like this idea, maybe a new Companion that's a Barber, and after you finish his quest you get the new hairstyles from him (There's a tattoo shop in the game, its a front for the Nuka Shine quest).
---
The lack of haircuts years later is starting to get pretty weird.
---
I mean, his last name is practically ‘Liar’, so maybe not so trustworthy?
---
If someone is trying to rush you to make a trade or is trying to get you to use their courier, that smells fishy. 
---
There are subs here on Reddit with good couriers. Check for those.
---
I’ve noticed that just about every resource in this game ends up feeling the same. It feels overwhelming to try to have enough, and then you get stronger, pick up some tricks, and play more efficiently, and then all of a sudden you have an abundance of that resource. 
---
I can’t remember the last time I needed to craft ammo. I just always have plenty. 
---
I can’t remember the last time I needed to run a power plant for fusion cores, my inventory just is always between 23-27. 
---
Caps just flow now, I dip below 10,000 because I buy something big, and within a couple days I’m above 25,000 again. 
---
Works for everything.
---
2 out of what, like 4. Mong.
---
You forgot the "I'm quitting" or "I'm cancelling my Fallout 1st subscription"
---
They are also susceptible to scorch plague
---
It’s not called overarmor
---
Have you seen captain noobs vid? He did it in like 38 seconds💀
---
Mirelurks are just giant crabs that happen to be susceptible to the scorched plague? I don’t know, I’m not a mutated crab virologist... I’m not even a regular virologist.
---
Love that event 👍🏽
---
YES!
---
CHAOSBUCKLE NEED LASER MUSKET BADLY.
---
Personally I get invulnerability with a vanguard block damage reduction build that pairs with my damage reduction perks whenever I block. Without it, I can still be tanky but I don’t reduce like all the damage. Blocking doesn’t work against guns with the damage reduction like it should. I still get like one to two shotted by players.
---
Yeah,sorry man I'll get on rn. My psn name is Egg_boyYT
---
damn pretty dope
---
Don't the vendors buy them for 400?
---
Cool.  I’ve rarely had PVP issues on public. But honestly only ever claim workshops when in needed to for score or atoms
---
I didn't care at all about this season, am about 3/4 the way through, but can't wait to grind the shit outta next season for that sweet power armor display.
---
I just want to know how much u have. Then I’ll pay in gifts
---
You cannot scrap fixers. Sorry
---
Well sorry! every time I shoot my gun in this fun ass game, I'm fighting for my damn life!I'm pressing all the buttons!
---
Yeah yeah, what he said, definitely not this Ultracite 5mm they drop by the hundreds I'm here for... Its you guys! No magic weapons? No problem! You take your time!
---
There are modded UA in the bos building also. Normally you find straight jacket or asylum outfit.
---
Checking pipboy then switching view will also help
---
Join party
---
Need more skins for guns and new guns in general.
---
😂
---
Awarded you because it is your cake day. Have Fun!
---
\
---
I use a minigun for bosses. And melee the rest.
---
Yeah they do.
---
It is a rare reward from savage divide events (the mask)
---
How does it go from 10 to 25k tho
---
Armor is through enclave events and quests. Sometimes they drop from enemies as well. 
---
The specific mask is a rare savage divide event reward.
---
Responders vendor in Whitespring sells it.
---
It’s arguably the most useful power armor if you wear the full set, so its worthy in that regard. Everyone can just craft it after doing the associated quest. The hard part is getting all the materials for it, since it’s relatively early in the game.
---
first thing i do when i log into a server is go check for asylum outfits. I'm trying to find a yellow to complete my collection so that's what i try first without fail. one miraculous day, maybe lol.
---
Yes and 3rd target on gun fu to be thorough
---
Sorry man, i thought I had some. I don't have any
---
Yo, all my friends are only pulling bullion and some scrip, which takes 10 mins tops, since they have completed the run. The servers are half empty too (EU, PC).
---
Scorchbeast Queen.
---
I use to hate that event... until I learned how to do it...lol
---
Oh geez that explains my first day playing. Fast travel and a queen corpse drops on my head. I walked away from it and the damn thing teleported and dropped on me again.
---
Yes.  its rare but i have seen several posts on this subject.  All hour vendirs are emptied out.
---
How do you convert? Is it that machine I unlocked from the legendary run board? Sorry I’m a newb.
---
Awesome.  Adding you. Thanks
---
Sometimes people like different things than you like
---
I am ALWAYS alone for it. Always! Steelheart and I bop around town, tho. That's ok; we got this.
---
The one and only time I had a partner, he was a level 12 with an Uncle Sam outfit and a minigun, lol. Wtf.
---
crafting it. I'm almost always nearly max caps so i buy a lot of my lead and steel from station vendors to get my caps down and just craft 5.56 by the ton.
---
Ok is it a single use or just once and it stays with you...not the nuke card but the one where you get into the test tube...lol
---
Crafting my own.
---
Retire them WHEN BETHESDA FIXES THEM! Till then all you are suggesting is censorship and suppression that Bethesda is already doing by locking our support tickets and ignoring the problem!
---
Treasury notes are worth 10 gold bullion each.  
---
The vending machine has 200 gold bullion every 21 hours. 
---
So you want them to make it so you can only get 20 gold per 21hrs? Or you want them to make the machine show 20 treasury notes? But why, it changes nothing. But them changing the code can fuck up dozens of other things.
---
Nah you have to do it every time you run through a silo. it's easy, takes under a minute
---
The communist bunker is so annoying because I like it but.. it’s broken and everything floats like 3 inches off the floor. I hope they fix it soon
---
I like these though, it’s always fun when I get a reddit post about me from one of my griefing victims.
---
The only time I ever cracked open my wallet for anything that fast was for that plague doctor mask.
---
Honestly you don’t notice the limit much with fo1st because of all the junk being unlimited
---
Gotchya...i got 2 cards so maybe ill laumch 2 tonight lol
---
i can.  Ill be on in a couple hours though.  Sinistrmark is my psn.
---
I'm lvl 212 now and I've never done it again. I sell my nuclear cards in my vendor lol
---
Yeah I won’t be killing her anytime soon, I’m level 41
---
happened twice in like 5 months for me. all your displays will have emptied as well
---
Yep,you got it!
---
&amp; no worries,we all had to start at the same spot...
---
I don’t think I’m gonna be able to get on tonight,but next time I’m on,I’ll message ya,&amp; give ya a bit I ammo &amp; show ya how the converter works,if ya hadn’t figured it out by then.
---
Interesting, it must change because behind the chest, I saw 3 teddy fears murdering a gnome.
---
You would think Fireproof 3 would do this, but no.
---
I always shoot the beavers next to my camp idk why 😆
---
I desperately could use aeweapin for dealing with wendigo spawn. Would 4000 caps get me something nice?on xbone
---
I think we should as a community just decide that the two or three lowest level players are responsible for the mobs and reviving while the high levels handle the big guy. Also to never EVER use the Tesla in the event. If only we had a way to make a plan before the fight via an in game text function since neither party or team voice chat works for both scenarios.
---
Holy fallout this guy gave you 6000 xp?
---
Had this problem for months, reported it, ticket was ignored.
---
I want all the light......
---
I was not aware you could buy both. It amazes me what I learn from this group still after almost three years in this game!!
---
Well I sell to the vendor for 1400 per day. 
---
I sell in my own vendor, any unyielding, bloodied, junkies legendary. Also little secret I shouldn’t share but hey why not. 
---
Once you have access to the Enclave vendor, you buy the plan for x-01 military paint. It costs under 200 caps, and I consistently sell it for 1476c. Don’t know why, but it works. 
---
Ammo goes quickly as well, 1c for everything. I’ve experimented recently with 2c for 5.56 and .45. Seems to still sell. 
---
And then I do almost every daily and event I can. Somehow it just works.
---
Yep, that too
---
Thanks! I have and it's a lot more efficient now.
---
Ok cool I’ll add you in a bit
---
P-per-perhaps....
---
Omg thanks so much ima try that out in a sec
---
False, it has nothing to so with camp glitches, any laggy server or would be thief with slow Internet can do this!
---
A problem being though that Bethesda still needs to make loot open to everyone regardless of whether you tagged at least in instances like this if not everywhere.  If you're killing all of the adds before they reach anyone else they're not getting any ammo to keep their reserves full.
---
what's ur built if u dont mind me asking?
---
I sell mutation serums. 1400 caps a day X 5 characters.
---
It still happens, apparently it can be done in trade menus now too!
---
Someone on here told me about that paint trick. First time I did it, it sold in under 15 minutes. 
---
If you hop servers the vendor has another copy for sale.
---
Strafe left or right and close the distance on it.  The assaultron will switch to melee when you are close.
---
Also probably same blocks with names at camden in the token redemption room. Seems to change names. Maybe devs kids or something. Also, there's a Mr. Fuzzy eating a meal on the roof in front.
---
What so you put it in your vendor and someone will buy it for around 1.4 k
---
Oh ok
---
Yep
---
Honestly I do it solely because they drive me insane. I get attacked by one like every ten seconds if nobody culls them lmao
---
I went from having three or less at all times to having 300-450 at all times using a simple in game mechanic. But hey bud, you don’t mind me taxing you on those illicit goods mate? Call it a bribe to the guard, because like the Guild’s master thief you stole time from Bethesda’s ridiculous grind.
---
I got in on closed beta, have played constantly since then, and have no concerns with patch 22, just love this game.
---
They didn't fix it, it isn't a hack it's a server glitch that also still  works on console!
---
I would like to have colored lights on all the power armor. I'd buy that as long as it was universal.
---
Purple lights help tremendously plus I cant even use my mothman lights without the paint. Which the light was the only reason I bought it
---
I have noticed that this game got a really bad rap at launch but i played all day and honestly thought it was a good time!
---
“I already bought this game should I come back and play now?” 
---
You already own the game dumbass, download it and play if you want to...
---
But how. Why doesnt everyone buy it at the enclave vendor?
---
Pick up every cola product.. except dark
---
I want the default to be 20 instead of 200 since it is a waste of time having to it there and move the slider back to 20 every time. I only use the Gold Press Machine at Foundation so maybe there is another practical use for the default of 200.
---
I don’t really think level has much to do with time invested. I’m 3275 hours in and my highest level character is 205, lowest is 115. I personally don’t care about leveling up. I just launched my first nuke a few weeks ago. I just wander around, do the occasional event, look for good legendaries, and help out low levels.
---
That would be great. I want to use the Nuka Cola door inside. Looks great closed. Open not so much
---
I’ll always blow up the cars in the galleria parking lot, I’ll shoot a random one and see how many I can get to chain together.
---
Agreed!!
---
Never even knew these MF’ers where a concept...
---
Those are both badass &amp; beautiful.
---
I love putting the broken and pristine cola machines next to it.  So few people realize that they can be a door. XD
---
Oh yeah for sure. I’d love the Shoulder Mounted Minigun and an Anti Material Rifle. Tbh I’d also kind of love a Holorifle just bc that was one of my favorite guns in NV but I realize that probably wouldn’t work from a lore standpoint lmao. (Inb4 Lol Bethesda Doesn’t Care Abt Lore)
---
I’d also personally just love to see some Fallout 3 and New Vegas era outfits come back. Like, what about the robes that BoS Scribes/Elders used to wear in F3/NV? Would love one of those. Also the ‘mercenary outfits’ from FO4’s Capital Wasteland Mercenaries add on would be a really nice addition.
---
yep, it’s what i focus on and i run medic HM, team medic, and empath serum
---
It would be more awesome if the damn door stayed shut when not used. Then you get the full double take effect
---
👏
---
Better yet, get rid of her. One of the most annoying things they've added to this game.
---
I bought mine for 1400 at the Welch station, check the lewisberg if it isn't there
---
Fuzzy!!!!! 
---
But yeah, I know right! Fucking hilarious.
---
Near Braxton medical supplies there is a camper with a broken skylight. You can get inside but must fast travel out. Inside is a ladder tangled in straggler vines. Fallout ladders, you cant "It just works" your way outta this one Todd.
---
Ill one up that, I use multiple shotguns and Enforcer, and and I kneecap every wendigo to a shambler, and I stim anyone I get to.
---
Its free tags and xp for everyone, and keep the wendigo threat to a minimum.
---
Beats me, but it works. I sold two to the same high level the other night. I restocked the machine after he bought the first and then he bought the other one. My guess is that he knows he can sell if for even more?
---
I figure it is just people who see something that sounds cool, that they don’t have. Maybe people don’t know that Enclave military vendor has x-01 mods for sale??? 
---
Try it out, it only costs you 200c.
---
So me
---
Yeah is ruined when people leave it open. XD
---
Thx
---
You can buy vanilla urban scout from the enclave bunker...as for the mask as previously stated,It’s currently rare as heck,&amp; “apparently” cost full caps,as In 30k,but I personally think that’s f’in nuts..I’d pay maaaaaybe half that.
---
But it’s all in what yer willing to pay,&amp; what whoever has is it,Is charging,as Is the way of the market.
---
Clicking on the Perfect Preserved Pie dispensers, I've never gotten it first try, but one day... one day!
---
I’m with OP, I’m a bell ringer. Doesn’t matter the type of bell, if I walk by it and it has a prompt, consider it dinged. 
---
For no other reason than it being an option to do so.
---
Actually! It already has one, in fact, there's multiple other attachments that are insanely useful that just aren't in the retail game for some reason, the pump action shotgun has a sight model, the 10 mm smh has a sight model, among a couple of others it's missing. Bethesdas fun.
---
Right and oh i didn't know that
---
Yes my strangler power armor looks sick swinging the peppered tenderizer in one hand
---
Speaking as a person who has firearms....it shouldnt be durabilty...or shots fire but "dirtyness"...instead of the gun "breaking" it could go on stages of jamming or missfireing. And we would have to "clean" our guns or any weapon for that matter...
---
My science scribe outfit looks like a grey tarp when I wear it but everyone says it looks fine to them 😆
---
Honestly I just get shit handed to me at this point. I don't have to pay for anything or dupe a goddamn thing.
---
&gt;For that, I nuke morgan town. Hella bloated ones and you can just refresh em by rejoining the server. I did it for about 2 hours and had 100+ of glowing/hardened mass and high rad fluids.
---
On a private world or public?
---
Demand a refund on that flux!
---
I wonder if anyone else has the same issue.  I have a 90% Reduced Weapon Weight Handmade, but the weight is 8.80 lb.  The normal one weighs 9.60 lb.  It looks like instead of "reduce weight by 90%", it is "90% weight/10% weight reduction".  It is not consistent with other weapons with 90% reduced weight as far as I have experienced.
---
1 to 3 minutes?  What is your build?
---
I’m a raider it is worth stealing it honestly. Feels good to not have to worry about ammo any time soon.
---
The stupid damage cap killed it. They completely unbalanced the mode and only people willing to build for the cap stayed.
---
I always activate any Wendigo Colossus plushie I see, look hearing that cute little angry yell
---
Same
---
Dis me
---
so...many...cursed...shovels...fml
---
Yeah. The Brotherhood of Steel would like you to donate some supplies to the cause. Russel is not associated with my particular chapter. Just remember the Brotherhood is better armed. We are Raiders really, we just pretend not to be.
---
Ran this 3 times focused on Wendingo spawns, each a successful event; yet to look earl :(. always having to respond at the worse time.
---
So *you're* the reason the economy's fucked!
---
 /s
---
I have been thinking this from day one! Thought they would have fixed it by now but nope! Very annoying to try to keep count.
---
There's a weird glitch right now where you do more damage when fighting him solo!
---
Unfortunatly...my dps always seems to be require. 😕
---
Fuck no
---
Yea had a player launch the 1st one...and the circle line of impact zone was just shy of the pitch fork on the map....about 10 mins later same player launched 2nd nuke...this time the mine was dead center...lol took out about 3 player bases in the process
---
I attack every player I come across
---
Honestly more tattoos pls, the face tattoos are nasty lookin 🤢
---
And the excavator
---
No I’m the reason why you probably got a legacy in your inventory.
---
The default is 200 gold bullion and treasury notes are worth 10 gold bullion each. 
---
If they change the default to 20 in the machine, you'll only be able to cash in 2 treasury notes for 20 gold bullion. The machine holds gold bullion, not treasury notes. 
---
If they change the value of treasury notes to 1, everyone loses a shitload of value. 
---
If they increase the value of treasury notes to 100, everyone gets 1000% increase of their current treasury notes value. 
---
I don't think you're putting into consideration how the mechanics of the gold bullion vending machines work.
---
People. Npcs. A stiff breeze.
---
I have one, I'm on pc if you're interested in trade.
---
I craft around 1k .308s so I can use my explosive light machine gun for a minute or 2. Then go back to saving up lead again.. I put my camp next to a lead resource node. Sometimes people leave their ammo factories open. That's a item from having max reputation with.. uh.. I dunno. Up near Vault 96 there's a workshop that makes ammo. But, I never saw much yield when I had it.  I was hoping to find a spot with lead and steel close enough but I don't think there is one. Plus I pick up tons of crap to scrap and seem to get plenty of steel. 
---
Course I'm still newish to the game.. ammo seems to be a struggle. I mainly use shotgun and .45s.
---
Either that or it never actually popped up. Anyone in a workshop zone is automatically hostile if it's being claimed or contested by anyone else. So if you wander through one and someone decides that's the moment to claim it they can kill you outright. 
---
Not that I really take issue with this mechanic, but it would be a help if they made it more clear in the pvp or workshop tutorials that if you don't want to pvp you should give workshop zones a wide berth in your travels.
---
L2P noob
---
I’m shotgun melee. I will run up to Earle, lay down some Enforcer joy to his knees, and then go play with likes of crippled Wendigos to free up the heavies and commandos. Rinse and repeat when he mutates. 
---
Gotta know your role!
---
*8k rounds of 5.56 later*
---
Yes all back it happened to me once
---
I dont have a legacy in my inventory.
---
&gt; Or why the constant calls to the server?
---
Clients cannot be trusted.  Someone might hack it to report back to the server "I just crafted 1,000,000 items!"
---
So anything affecting game state must be calculated on the server then reported to the client.
---
Now, some online systems do both the actual server-side calculation as well as a local client-side projection of the expected results so that feedback to the user can be real-time, but this breaks down if the results are randomized such as a Luck-based perk as the client can't know if the perk will proc on the server or not.  So most games, apparently FO76 included, will calculate those via round-trip call to the server.
---
I have similar issues with the Bloody Mess or Enforcer perks: it sometimes doesn't proc until a second or more after I've ceased fire, so there are these weird cases where I've stopped firing, the enemy still has most of their health bar, then explodes and dies while I'm reloading or maneuvering. So I've learned to fire fewer rounds than it appears I should need to kill it, because maybe I've already killed it but it hasn't responded yet.
---
I love healing factor...but I've only had to buy it once (thank you starched genes).
---
It’s something a lot of the beta male foodbuilds on this sub won’t shut up about.
---
K thanks
---
Everyone wants everything for next to no effort.  We all know how hard this is to get legit if your not really a fan of nw. There has to be some kind of rewards to make people want to play nw. There are lots of people who put their head down and spent many hours grinding nw to earn this, and you want to throw it in all of those peoples face and make this common.
---
With so little time remaining, I'm sure they can pull this off. /s
---
Killing? No. But, you can always join the event and hopefully put in enough damage to earn loot. When people nuke the bottom right hand of the map it'll spawn the fight. She takes a number of people to kill usually. Scorched Earth it's called.
---
We used to get that visual bug during godmode.
---
Bloodied sneak commando ofc
---
I just look at how many components are needed for the number to be created, then calculate the how many components should be left when I've crafted enough, then spam the craft button until the components drop to that level.
---
I try to kill the wendigos but I'm usually the only one so I'll run to where everyone is so they start attacking them. Works 100% of the time, every time 😎
---
When I claim Beckley Mine to get oil, I always build sirens around it in random places to give the town near by a Silent Hill feel.
---
Yes it drops in the savage divide enclave event and both masks can drop at uranium fever and some other stuff
---
How bout they fix bugs, like the fast travel glitch, trade glitch, without fu€Kin more shit up, before they add a new comb over...
---
200 IQ
---
Activate the smoke machine in my CAMP.
---
Mine does this too, I didn't realize my camp was inside a blast zone and it got completely destroyed, I hadn't 100% repaired it and now it "explodes" every time I log in. It's a cool bug and I don't want it to go away lol
---
Hahaha, awww... I have a pet Mirelurk King, and watching him defending my camp against ghouls and super mutants is so awesome... with his sound, spits and all ;D
---
It's human flesh, probably
---
"Iguana" is the Fallout universe equivalent to Soylent Green. There is lore in previous games about it
---
Whitespring Station?
---
Altho you will want to be careful to not step into the nuked zone without hazmat or power armor. I think my 1st time at the event I crossed the edge of the nuke zone, tried to get my PA out real quick and dropped dead from rads.
---
Some people dont want to play a battle royale mate. And Id hardly call a month or twos worth of grinding challenges ‘next to no effort’. Besides, the Nuclear Winter version is totally different in terms of color, it stands out as a clear ‘I got this from Nuclear Winter’ skin... Really not seeing what the issue is.
---
I go to Foundation. 
---
I go to the Gold Press Machine. 
---
It asks me how many Treasury Notes I want to covert to gold bullion - the default is 200. 
---
I must change it to 20 Treasury Notes to be able to get my 200 gold bullion.
---
Is this not annoying to anyone else? Or are you guys using different machines or something.
---
Hey friends, julie her- welp, back to no radio for me.
---
I based my build around healing/reviving and tanking.  I keep everyone topped up with team medic, I have empath rolling, I'm always clearing adds, and I can tank/body block with my vanguards if shit gets rough.  Lately I've been distributing cranberry relish before the event starts too.  If you see Waffle_Bat on PC, join up, maybe donate a few super stims to the cause.  I bring goodies.
---
Few weeks ago I had some little twat come to my camp then started begging me to give them all my stimpacks with really poor typing skills. I had over 200 for sale in my vendor.
---
How about streaks for my hair?
---
I tried to save other people and wound up being the neediest flopper in the pack.
---
Some days the heroics do not go as planned.
---
Just sell it to the bot Vendors. From memory you get around 100 caps I think for it
---
I also like that she plays dark as a dungeon and comments on it when someone goes into lucky hole mine.
---
Has anyone had trouble reviving people during ACP?  Throughout, I was trying to revive every fallen person I could find.  It wouldn’t let me.....
---
Check out Oxhorn's video on it, you'll learn everything...
---
Uhh. That’s really strange cause I’m an Heavy Gunner and I do not hit him for 1 damage at all. What heavy are you using? Even without perks no one should be hitting 1 damage. Oh one last thing what’s your range stat? You could be out of range.
---
Seen it during fallout 2 days where it was human meat.. 🤣
---
What gun is having this issue, for starters?
---
For what it is worth they have given us one super-niche Fallout 1 item recently, and have another one coming soon  (the BoS bannerstand, and the bunker)
---
A month...... I'll like to see you start from scratch and get that skin in a month on nw, or even 2 months.
---
Are we sure this is a bug, seems a little intentional to me.  A reward for end gamers and a goal for low levels. BGS knows the old timers are tired of the silo and this cuts that in half ish. Your thoughts?
---
#WAIT
---
So the log off and log back on thing still works? I nuked whitesprings on my private server yesterday and I logged off n on like 5 times and nothing respawned..... Big rip
---
That's way too logical and smart for the Neanderthals running Bethesda.
---
The T-51 base paint that is in game is the classic paint. Check out some lost hills screenshots, that is the ole paint, just blown up from tiny pixels
---
If the scorched or the ferals dont get you, the ra- BOOM
---
They stack
---
amen.  I've often needed to back out of crafting ammo because i could not remember how much i had of various calibre
---
I shoot my gauss rifle and two shot them and they drop 30 ammo so i usually focus the spawn.
---
I actually got to overseer 104 in a little under 2 months
---
There was a streamer who did it in under 3 weeks
---
I use SS unyielding armour, with a  vampires laser rifle, and most of my perks are around exploration, not combat, il send a screenshot when I get home as I can’t remember off the top of my head
---
How about we get some higher level content. The waistline is boring after lvl 100. Events are overdone and low level like the teapot and swarm of suitors.. Its all lvl 25 or 30. Maybe add more dungeon crawls or allow daily ops every hour. Something.
---
Me reading this while holding 58 stims and one shooting the spawns with my plasma caster.
---
It’s coming but first you need to donate 600,000,000 ultracite scrap, 650,000,000 black titanium and 750,000,000 asbestos to whitespring bunker.
---
I totally do it for the shotgun shells.
---
Threads complaining about other threads complaining about broken aspects of the game that Bethesda is too stupid and/or lazy to fix.
---
Just did it an hour ago. Worked fine.
---
I mean with the classic Brotherhood insignia. I know the base T-51B is the classic Power Armor paint. It would be awesome to have the Brotherhood of Steel insignia on the shoulders.
---
What i mean is: The old Brotherhood paint schemes - not the time traveling schemes that we currently have.
---
Just got it at Welch Station, thanks!
---
Yw :)
---
funny thing , I was on a team but didn't follow them into the mine, then the event stopped showing but i clicked on my tl and selected join event from there and i was teleported inside the mine even though the exterior was already blocked off. i got in just as they were killing Earl, didnt get event completion.
---
Lvl 45 high speed minigun , vampire with exploding bullets , and 50 damage resistant while reloading . It says it dose 32 damage but I shit you not every shot is one damage sometimes not even just to Earle, regular creatures sometimes get 1 and 1 . It’s annoying going to a scorched fight , using 3000 bullets and getting no loot cause I didn’t do like any damage. I seriously don’t understand it . And that’s just base . Because like I said even with heavy gunner lvl 1 on its the exact same . Nothing changes . I’ve swapped to a gauss mini gun and it dose 6 and 6 , bullet and electric damage . I’m going to try and tossing the perk on and seeing what that gun dose and just seeing if it’s the vamps minigun that’s bugged or me
---
And that’s fine, but the frustration is... that’s it. That’s literally all she does.
---
I do wish there was some mechanism to broadcast to a server/world "I'll be launching a nuke, prepare for SBQ/Earl"
---
or Nuka-Cola brewing station and fermenter, I know there is a nukashine one but I want my bright red and white one. Maybe with the bottles replaced with Nuka-Cola bottles.
---
So far I  have scored 3 from the one at the Rusty Pick
---
I am new, does the stand for?
---
I ring the bell on the counter every time I visit the Purveyor, and attempt the port a diner when I leave and got my second preserved pie yesterday!
---
Need to also learn plans.
---
Uhhh Yea you are all welcome.... **takes off backpack and shoves hundreds of screws in it**
---
I have that problem when I log in usually, been told it's just a visual bug. But, for a bit there I was turning it off and on again.. just to be sure. Fast travel might fix the visual issue. I've notice it reads correctly afterwards usually, when I remember to check.
---
They also need to learn the plans
---
Yes happened to me today as well as many items removed from my displays. This is so freakin annoying, all that work for nothing. 
---
Hey Bethesda, at least title this game with a "BETA" or "Early Access"  tag after its name so I can know not to invest more time in it anymore.
---
I only use the foundation machine which most people do. Cause it's actually outside, unlike at crater. 
---
When I click on the machine it defaults to hovering over my Treasury notes, when I click on the treasury notes it defaults to the max amount I have. I hold left bumper for a split second to get to 0, then slide to 20. 
---
So, what you're asking them to do is make it so you can't cash in more than 20 even if you have more than that. Which you can't, if the machine doesn't have enough gold it won't let the transaction go through. If you're already near max gold it even warns you'll only get so much and lose the excess. 
---
Everything you select will default to the max amount you have on hand when dropping, transferring, selling etc. I assume if they change the default to 20, everything will default to 20 when selected. That would be more annoying to me for a lot of reasons.
---
I started NW for the first time when the Season started, and got to Rank 100 in just over a month. And that was from exclusively sitting in bushes.
---
Dam it that sucks, thanks dude
---
Access to everything but actual in game knowledge
---
Wow im a fool. That blows and explains alot. Lol
---
I tried playing it once. The screech ended up making my character walk into the only danger in the whole mine, that one drill. Ended up instantly dying and getting that wondrous spawn glitch. I was over encumbered so it wouldn’t let me spawn anywhere. Had to just quit the game and hope it boots up normally next time.
---
I didn't say it couldn't be done. I said I'll like to see you do it from scratch. And you would have both of those paints if you were.
---
My worst fear lol
---
Oh man I wish I can help but I’m overcumber by like 1k+pounds and I’m still trying to transfer stuff
---
Edit:I’ll try to lose all my weight and then I can help you
---
Some of us actually like cryptography. We don't however like buggy POS games that don't give us a keyword to work with, so we say fuck it and go to nukacrypt anyway.
---
I miss the good old days of video games where damage 31 meant damage 31. Not 31 against this type of enemy, 25 against a different type, 6 against this boss, etc.
---
I wish there would be way more enemies in the open world between events as well though... for example, i walk a long way to other side of the map but meet no ghouls in the forests  . Just some radstags hopping around and it makes the trip by foot boring. I want ghouls to stalk me.
---
They should make Hellfire skins be a high tier reward for different activities/sources.
---
Nuclear Winter can have the Prototype skin. Let Seasons have one or both of the Flames skins. Give Fallout 1st the Matte Black Classic skin, etc.
---
Took me a month to get a turret out if a tree I accidentally put. I didn't actively try that much but, I had to get just the right angle to get the unseen hit box.
---
I was running away while the wendingo spawns were chasing me and I was firing my shotgun while backpeddling and the rest of the party was thanking me for distracting them when in reality I was just trying to stay alive.
---
Well better to know late then never.  Ill be saving my scripts now until I get some plans for them. 3 alts x 150 scripts a day for like 3 months . Hit a few nice things but explains the never hitting a fixer or HM on any of them
---
Hah! I know the feeling. I am still sometimes bringing up the map when I want to bring up the pip boy. I don't know what's up with that.
---
Yeah although that isn't exactly hard to sit in a bush or the water, it takes lots of time. I know someone who also does the same. I dont play in there team because its very boring and they don't play or help the team only them selves.
---
I’ve earned 6 badges from that event and am up to seven, one away from any decent backpack mods. Most of the time others will hop in and help, so I’ll try not to destroy everything in sight. But when I end up running it alone, I go all out and that’s when I’ve gotten possum badges. When I kill and do everything. Is this how it’s set up or is it a coincidence?
---
They should honestly just take it out of the game. I highly doubt a single player uses it the way it was intended
---
Flag 👏🏻 Pets 👏🏻 as 👏🏻 Essential 👏🏻
---
I'm still looking for the red one but hundreds of tries and nothing. Coincidence I got a yellow one today!
---
Kinda dumb, we should be able to craft more ammo for it
---
And Ultracite.
---
as a shotgunner it seems like the most efficient use of my ammo and weapon.  happy to leave Earl to the heavy gunners the second we start to get swarmed.  same strategy for the Queen fights
---
one wasteland should fix that
---
How exactly does this work? Last time I chucked a piece of explosive bait, nothing happened.
---
You could just hit up the Purveyor with your main and get a friend to help you give it to your alt. That’s what I did with mine.
---
This is the answer. We still need explosive bait for blowing up the camps of people who are legitimately griefing and harassing others.
---
Did you launch yet?  I'm available to help.
---
Doesn't their presence alone make the fight harder like the SBQ?
---
didn't stop hating them until i was able to single-shot them
---
But why not add in the unused skins for the seasons or atomic shop? The NW variant is much more noticable than the others. Also, all the other rewards at the higher ranks are well worth the grind, some even cooler than the Hellfire.
---
And at this point why even try to make NW more appealing? Since its release there has only been 2 content updates. 1 map, and the other bringing in a few weapons. Yes there's all the challenges, but that's not really new content to the game mode
---
Yeah, the blue one with the terminal. It has an interface that most people hate using but, they did update it recently and increased the amounts of ammo you can convert. Before it was awful to convert a lot of ammo. Tips I've seen is making arrows or bolts(can't remember which gives better points) can be turned into a good amount of points. The points allow you buy ammo. If you end up with tons of steel, make railroad spikes for points. They only use steel.

Honestly it is a really cool idea and would have been fine as a one time thing for access to nukes,  but not as a thing you have to repeat.  I think that they learned their lesson and that lead to the grafton pawn shop quest and bos transmissions.
---
Here we go... I love these:
---
"BETA player returning. What's the new Meta?"
---
"FIX. THE. FAST. TRAVEL. BUG!!!"
---
"Well, actually, the nerf isn't as bad as people think and here's my Excel spreadsheet and graphs using bad math showing why."
---
"Can we get more rewards after finishing the Legendary Run??" (Actually scratch that one. I'm tired of seeing it, but it's legit.)
---
Collaborate and listen...
---
Truth. 
---
Side note, anyone else getting killed an absurd amount of times by the damn ceiling? Asking for a friend..
---
The explosion hurts camp objects including owned pets part of the camp
---
That's not what this thread is.  Nobody said it was to complain about bethesda or their lack of fixing anything.  It said give your top three subjects that are irritating, to which you replied with one assumptive post, possibly because you are too stupid and/or lazy to give three.
---
I use a gatling laser or a VE 50 cal on earle. I have all heavy cards in strength and bloody mess and some other stuff too. I hit about 15 to 25 depending on adrenaline stats at the time. 
---
If you are only using one card at rank one, dont expect much change. Need to do thewhole load out for earle. He has a lot of armor, dps reducing, and dr. Got to a common enemy around 50, scorched is easiest to fin like at the power substation north of grafton steel. Start off low, clear the area and keep track of the hits and somewhat average dps. Then put all cards on and wait 20 minutes, shuld take that long to get everything done. Go back and do it again. Should show as an increase around 60% wth gunner cards at max, bloody mess will add 15%?, and adrenaline will add 60% at the 6th kill, which that place only holds 4 or 5 at a time so it wont show max normally. 
---
This should be a good test to show everything works.
---
I disagree more pvp content needs to be added.  I really enjoy what little pvp there is.  Including destroying camps whenever the opportunity artists.  It has been in the game all along.
---
Obnoxious begging seems to be part and parcel of playing an MMO unfortunately.
---
Fallout 76 has a sharp drop off in terms of damage against enemies with high resistances.
---
Low damage, high fire rate weapons perform poorly. Low base damage also will only see minor boosts from perks like Heavy Gunner. So if you deal 31 damage, and have a 10% boost from the Perk, it only goes up to 34 damage. Which is borderline useless.
---
Automatic weapons benefit much more from higher damage instead of higher Fire Rate.
---
Yes but nobody heals anyone in this event especially the higher levels
---
Even then they don't deserve the absolute shit they get from other players
---
Map76 supposedly can direct you to spawns but it’s not always the most accurate if someone else grabbed it.
---
Might work better on private but I’ve heard it affects both.
---
Best of luck
---
Doesn't change the fact that it only took a month.
---
"Am I the only one who ________"
---
No, no you're not.
---
aw yes the true reason for the Great War. The Gnome-Teddy war.
---
Is this some special mask or the white surgical looking one
---
Yh, I have that, but as you say it isn't the most reliable. I enjoy the public servers more as private is just too quiet. Thanks.
---
Yeah some of them had it on the breastplate in like a reddish-brown, that would rock.
---
I'd also love to see some of the custom helmet paints we see in 76 as paint jobs (like at huntersville)
---
And you believe that continuing to beat a dead horse here will make one iota's difference in whether Bethesda will fix anything?  That's naive.  This isn't a bethesda bug report forum.
---
I clip through the wall directly outside the elevator in the main room and then jet pack up to the control room.  What path do you take?
---
Hell, it takes me 5 minutes just to get the lights turned and find a place that it'll actually let me out of my power armor lol.   
---
Isn't the launch prep alone close to 5 minutes?
---
I complete it in 10-12 minutes per run.
---
I can also run games like Warzone and Apex at 60FPS minimum but I've always had inconsistent frame drops with FO76 and NW. My specs are Ryzen 5 2600, XFX Radeon RX580 8GB, 16GB Ram, Sony SSD, Gigabyte B450 motherboard. I've tried lowest and highest settings and nearly no difference. FO4 runs above 60FPS.
---
Neither is Bethesda's Bug Report forum or their ticket system, they get locked and ignored! Bad Publicity is the only thing thing that'll get through to Bethesda and if we stop mentioning it ignorant players will just assume Bethesda actually fixed it like their patch notes claim!
---
You probably just need better gear.  Namely a weapon that can kill it quickly or some good power armor.
---
I'm a Fallout 4 fan, less of a 76 fan, and Nuclear Winter is the only reason I keep the game installed.
---
I am and have been since it's release.
---
FO76 players with long hair: \*exists\*
---
Bethesda: I'm am looking away, I do not see it
---
I would love a vault labcoat! My character was Vault 76's doctor and while I have the BOS and Arktos labcoats, it doesn't feel right like a vault tec one would.
---
That's the problem they should be an outfit like they were ORIGINALY
---
Lmfao. I'm taking this tp and fertilizer idea to troll some friends later ,😂
---
Damage cards for weapon /expert/master
---
wut
---
COME AT ME BRO
---
My vendors have been displaying random names assigned to them, although I can still use them as per normal. Occasionally my ally will behave like he/she is someone else's ally (dialog). Weird, I hope the vendor issue doesn't allow exploits to occur.
---
I try to cripple them with my shotgun so they easier to take out
---
There's a place on the bottom of the map where ypu can catapult skeletons, love it
---
Right but you said if a low level keeps don't they'll just leave, no biggie.
---
Yes biggie... You bump up the difficulty and then leave?
---
Unlearn the hoarding you've learned from the earlier games. Took me a good while to do that. Someone posted a good doc to use, bulk junk and sell it every day. If you know you use a resource a lot, tag it and just pick that up ignoring other stuff. You don't really need another clean coffee cup.
---
Once you get higher level and have figured out your Stash problems you'll run into a new problem. 150 scrip a day and you will likely get more Legendaries then you can sell.
---
Oh, also things like Stimpacks and gun powder/ores seem to use up a lot of stash storage. While you might have reduction cards, your stash doesn't and it might be better for you to keep them on you instead of in your stash. I think I'm currently running into a stimpack problem since a recent event pushed me up to 200 stimpacks.
---
Also, also.. look up the Excavator quest. I think it's a level 30 quest. Farm up Black Titanium 1st, think you need 40 of it? The Excavator is Power Armor that gives you 100 more weight. Handy to pull out when you've picked up just one too many clean coffee cups you don't need.
---
That I was unaware of, but I can't imagine using a BP weapon at that fight.
---
Same. Scaling removes all incentive for leveling. Plus I like to go to low level zones now and then and have godlike powers.
---
I think it might be your build that’s broken, not the enemies.
---
Then you must never have had a tamed pet in your camp before. Cause I don’t like wasting time redoing what I already worked on.
---
Do you have the ammo?
---
My guy the very first time I picked up the bos fatigues out in the marsh they were under armor. The update that made the bos event go live made them into a outfit. They were never originally an outfit that's my personal experience with them.
---
LOL ok mama.
---
No because then someone else can join
---
Sadly no flux return
---
Just drop another item near the bag and it should move to you.
---
Nothing wrong with going after Beaver 😎
---
I think we are in the minority unfortunately.
---
Is that an outfit or a under armor?? And where do I find it
---
You are correct, but even the 90% is very significant in relation to non pa resistance.
---
https://i.imgur.com/C0QtIKn.png
---
Same with vending machine ^
---
Yeah I have over 8k on my 50 cal. And 700+ shells on my shotgun.
---
That's a party I could get behind.
---
I've never seen/had an issue with low lev players. I mean the event itself is buggy as fuck, nothing like getting gliched and booted from the sever mid/end of the event and get screwed outta loot adter wasting ammo. 
---
Let them in they gotta learn and level up some how and and most of the time it's someone leveling a alt toon.
---
I have the .50 cal prime I just don’t have the plans to be able to make the ultracite ammo for it
---
Same... does Dark spawn in World, except for Phi House?
---
Wtf is with people downvoting you
---
Hammer time!
---
Oh that’s stupid you shouldn’t need the plan to craft the ammo
---
Unused? I see people with these every now and then plus some of my friends have and also use it. But yes, maybe a dull variant might be an idea to make the other more appealing to newer players. And i agree they should make nw more appealing if it's gonna stay. I play it, but the wait to get in is what kills it for me. Maybe merging regions or making region selectable to choose.
---
😂😂👍🏽
---
Calm down you screaming Gollum-looking shitbag
---
Never had a pet, but my camp has been destroyed before.  It is part of the game.  Online multiplayer survival. It fun and good for you.
---
My problem is that this sub isn't intended to be a soapbox to be used as a personal megaphone to Bethesda. There are proper channels to use for that.  Yes, they ignore half of it, but that in itself should tell you something about these subjects.  They know.
---
Yep - Imagine a reflex peeper and a little chirpy... Would use that gun religiously if such a world existed.  As-is: it’s a Solid Meh.
---
How many matches in those 3 weeks
---
Can buy it at the nuka bar at whitesprings. It’s trash though. Kicks off any other alcohol you may be using like bock or hefe
---
I think word got out about how this community was nice and overly generous to other players, especially new ones,  now all the greedy sacks of laziness want hand outs...tell em piss off!
---
Y'know, that's fair.
---
Yes more boom boom please
---
This post reminded me to check and I got my first forest, thanks you!
---
Yep this happens to me too on Xbox. 99% of the time the game will switch between my Hunting Rifle and Fixer by pressing the left Dpad, but 1% of the time it’ll either switch to fists or another weapon in my inventory. Going into my inventory and selecting/deselecting the two weapons usually sets them up as the main choices again but sometimes I have to do it multiple times.
---
This happens in NW too which really doesn’t help. Super annoying.
---
There was a bug where you were actually able to do this when the BoS Fatigues were messed up.
---
I was talking about the unused variants of the Hellfire. The black + blue flames and black + red flames 
---
I'm against adding the NW variant to be unlocked through any other means unless they remove NW
---
Twice lucky here... first try... never tried more than once at same machine
---
According to wikis and some other posts cultist blade was removed from the legendary loot pools
---
Ok, just like tech support, we gotta go over the simplest explanations first (it's the device plugged in). So you have ammo, the weapons are in usable condition, have we ruled out sticky buttons?
---
LOL it reminds me of the movie Men In Black where Will Smith was doing the test for joining the MIB and the one guy was just all excited and blabbing "The best of the best of the best.. SIR"
---
I'd love to see the Wattz come back like the Plasma Caster: a slower firing, but more powerful, version of the regular laser, with the regular one improved for more rapid usage.
---
YES!! 😂🤣👍🏽
---
Someone gave me a 3 star legendary instigating .50 cal prime and dropped me ultracite .50 ammo for it and now I’ve run out but when I go to make ultra cite ammo, I have the option to make every other kind of ammo except for the .50
---
That’s weird
---
Damnit. So I'm looking for a legacy piece then?
---
No idea but he live streamed it 
---
He wasn't a large streaner, saw a post in this sub about it during the weeks after release of NW
---
While back I took a pick w/ The ORS &amp; Just noticed this today on a loading screen - the right face was grinning.  LOL.
---
Under armour. Was in the atom shop a while back. 
---
There are photos at bottom of this
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grafton_High_tracksuit
---
I play the Game Pass version as well. Can't really say I have any FPS issues, but I only use a single monitor. I often shift tab to firefox and discord too. I have mine installed on a second drive cause my OS takes up most of my SSD. 
---
Maybe multiple monitors is confusing your gpu, but sadly I'm not nearly tech savvy to figure out how to fix that.
---
Lol, Yeah. Thats the way this subreddit works. If you say something that someone doesn't like its downvoted. Even If you give a valid reason, as to why you think something shouldn't happen. I've gotten 3 upvotes but i would seem 4 down votes. As of now. Lol.
---
Fortnite was already far in the process of dying when NW was announced. BR wasn't even that popular at that point. What would they be pandering to if they're not selling anything for it and not targeting any new audience?
---
Lmao, a True Raider 😎
---
I think they don't know how to fix them without rendering shotguns useless.
---
To be honest, shotguns are magic when in VATS, and still suck away from it. And it makes sense for a ghoul to die if shot with a shotgun to the face. 
---
The magic solution is as close to "fixed" as it gets, I am afraid. But I would love to be a programmer in order to imagine how a piece of "reduce damage while blocking" armor can turn weapons into magic weapons.
---
If you like pvp then do nuclear winter. It’s the area for people who like to do that. If you want to pvp in the public servers then destroying anyone’s camp should warrant a 100 cap bounty so there actually is a justified deterrent. 5 caps is crap. If you break my property you best bet those charges are gonna be high. Even killing my pet. Immediate 1000 caps bounty. It’s only fair
---
I don't think that is quite fair either.  There is a veritable wall of posts about the other things that didn't get fixed.  I don't think one can assume that Bethesda only fixes things that are clogging up Reddit.  They fix what they want to fix, when they want to fix it.  What we say here means next to diddly.  The PTS forum is more what steers Bethesda.
---
Sounds super Creepy 👍🏽
---
Seems so but I'd wait for some other replies since others might be more knowledgeable about it
---
1. Yes the device is plugged in
---
2. Yes they have tons if ammo
---
3. Yes they are in good condition
---
4. No because leading up to the fight I had no issues. I was testing out my new revolver rifle to see if its true it takes both pistol and rifle perks and it does. I was switching to my Shotgun because i was going to finish off the bear and then realized i wasn't switching at all.  The weapon would immediately unequip.
---
I use shotguns, and one of the shotgun perks, at max level, reduces spread by 30% and all shotguns have 90% weight.
---
The thank you was great.  It was everything else in the post that sucked.
---
I wish I could build more of them
---
I sometime just go around and get one from every spot I can't think of, using bloodied to increase luck seems to help but I always have to try more than once
---
Nice 👍🏽
---
LOL upvoted for the excel spreadsheet/bad math.  That was a good one.
---
Because of engine limitations, the weightless legendary effect (on both armor and weapons) is a subtraction from the base weight only. It does not affect mods. Incidentally, sturdy/heavy on armor is a hidden "mod", so that additional weight is not affected either.
---
The engine limitation comes from the fact that it can not actively track all the new additions. It would have to be a player effect for that to be the case, like perks and 3* weight reduction armor. But then, the weight would only be reduced while you have the weapon equipped, and not when it's in your stash or sitting in your inventory. Same reason why quad does not boost any benefits from extended magazines, or why two shot only gives you +25% base damage
---
It only just now happened with me.  Was testing my new revolver rifle which takes both pistol and rifle perks and was going to finish off the bear with my junkies shotgun when suddenly this bug happened.
---
Excavator!!
---
Oh hell yes!! That is awesome 😎
---
Definitely this. We can’t hit shit anymore anyway.
---
See you in the wasteland!  Beware the Raiders.
---
Aside from vendors... and Phi House... didn't think it was a world spawn though??
---
Honestly if they add a decent beard id buy it
---
I think I got one recently with shit prefixes and junked it, or else would have saved it for me player vendor for the role-players. Sold a ghoul slayer's grognak's axe and an executioner's guitar sword to a guy who needed script, tho.
---
Would love to have a bloodied cultist blade, but there is a mod called sacirficial blade that makes a one-handed bladed weapon look cultish. Gonna use it on my bloodied machete with swing speed, but need to stack up makeshift warrior.
---
Have you looked into any of that? A ghoul slayer's cultist blade modified with sacrificial would be cool lol. Wait are cultist blades already modified with sacrifical?
---
I don't mind the Wendigos as much as the ones that continue to spawn after the event is over.  Geez give me a chance to loot a few screws without a constant pointy black finger up my rear end.  And up the escape timer a bit..
---
There's something missing in this story. There is no way to engage pvp vs a player in pacifist mode outside of a workshop or pvp event like hunter hunted or monster mash. 
---
Got a video of this happening?
---
My guess is op was owner of a workshop, inside the workshop boundary, and thus there's nothing to see here.
---
Yes! the right one for me, too. Haha
---
Out of 15 events tonight on Xbox it was the worst FPS I had. There was so many like you said
---
😩
---
Well, the trick with wendigos is to avoid attracting them. Have you tried not looking so delicious?
---
Next time you are there, meditate and become 'one' with the vegetable. Cannibals hate vegetables.
---
pretty much would settle for any tats that don't suck to be honest
---
Everytime I see this event it always pops up when there’s a queen for some reason for me
---
I feel like I lost more health from the ceiling than from the wendy spawns
---
Ah I see lol
---
I rocked a Vampire's swingspeed cultist dagger for many lower levels.  It was a life saver, literally.  I still have it because I can't bear to scrip old faithful.
---
No idea whether the loot pool still contains legendary cultist blades, but in 500 levels I've never gotten one.
---
enjoy it while it lasts
---
I actively seek pvp and haven't encountered this.  Unless your in a work shop it requires two party permission
---
No. The queen's health is static regardless of the number of players. 35k hp +70% mitigation +refresh at half power. She effectively has ~135k hp regardless of the number of people in the event.
---
I think somewhat of a middle ground would be nice. Most things definitely shouldn't be pristine, but there's a different between 'rough construction' and 'assembled out of garbage'.
---
It's still a shame there's no log building sets, because as shown by Foundation, it's an excellent choice for building simple structures.
---
Bethesda sure try with locking every ticket that even mentions score!
---
Do we need to damage Earle a certain % like the SBQ in order to get loot if we concentrate mainly on spawns?
---
Youre all welcome.
---
I'd like to see a standard hellfire power armor skin though
---
also would love the tribal spear and clothing as a option to make a cool themed character
---
Did it seem to go down faster as you continued to shoot?
---
Is there a recipe for explosive bait?
---
I got a bloodied BP rifle thats glitched so it just fires as fast as one pulls thr trigger when the event starts I can run down vats a head and fire till the gun breaks this usually is enough to get him to mutate. 
---
After that though I let the fight run normal.
---
i assume you mean sbq pops up? i hear ya man i would jump on that asap if came up esp since everyone just does acp nonstop.
---
Communist fence snaps at 45 degrees in addition to 90 and 180. I found them pretty forgiving to work with.
---
They can't get weapon skins right, I'm not sure how they would handle a new kind of weapon
---
I have no clue man. It’s trash and I don’t look for it
---
I got it twenty days ago, doing the event. Love it. I wear it for ACP. I know it is not possible to repair it, but... What are you saving it for? Just wear it! 
---
It is an imaginary item in a videogame. Enjoy the suit.
---
It's not like I was expecting it so no I don't. :(
---
I was at a workshop but it was already mine and I was building on it. So it couldn't have been contested right?
---
It's also happened at train stations more than once, now that I think about it. Anything special about train stations?
---
I've had pacifist mode since it became a feature, bc I hate pvp. I wish it worked both ways.
---
What about snoo snoo? Where is the love?
---
Yea I mean  doing acp and SBQ if you want to join along you can but if I see project PP I’ll surly do it if I’m not fighting Earle or SBQ
---
I see it but with ACP it seems people aren’t bothered and every time I’ve gone it’s either ending or an XP farming event from others.
---
I’d love to finally get a team to do it in full.
---
I bought the Bear Arms Plan off a player vendor awhile back for a decent amount.
---
That would be how i'd do it. Give it an alternate ported barrel, some different clips (e.x. perforating), muzzle brake and other options, different scopes, and a stabilized stock for aiding with the recoil.
---
Yes it is in a mission from rose the robot
---
Plus the vault tec labcoat from the atom shop has khakis and a white shirt, not a vault suit.
---
Seemed to, but the lmg goes through 75 rounds quickly and then I have to reload, plus the recoil is awful so I tend to fire in bursts.
---
&gt; There has to be some kind of rewards to make people want to play nw.
---
I think that just sorta speaks for the state of Nuclear Winter. No one (barring a few people) actually wants to play it. Locking stuff behind it doesn't make the game mode better.
---
Depends on where you stay. In some other parts of the world. Like where i am. It takes anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes just to get to a lobby, that doesn't mean you actually make it into the game. Sometimes you even get dc when your playing. So if you waited 20mins to get to lobby and it dc's there goes at lease 40mins. Or to hide and wait out a game is normal 30mins+ So for some it's ALOT longer then others.
---
Probably magic, but for the reasons you pointed out not the best.
---
It sadly isn't a magic weapon because you need a higher firerate.  If it was explosive it would be.  There may be weird cases involving server lag versus the total lack thereof where it could possibly trigger magic damage, but those cases would be very rare.
---
The mechanics of this are very weird, and because of that anything is possible but only in rare situations.
---
Edit: Actually the explosive one wouldn't be magic either because you'd lose the magic suffix.  If you had magic armor, it might work.
---
IE does work.
---
Definitely, we need unique uniques in this game.
---
This. I hope OP read this in time before giving up...
---
Yh, I get a few minutes hitting Earl, then I concentrate on the wendigos and reviving. I have my red asylum uniform, red had, responders backpack and jail collar piece.
---
Yes spread the love in the wasteland with 5.56!
---
Idk why but recently I’ve noticed nobody ever revives teammates during events
---
Agreed. I ended up with nearly 50 wendigo spawns chasing me yesterday. Safe to say I died lol.  I just couldn’t kill them all in time and stimpack and shoot.
---
I’d honestly rather they redid the XP system first, and then gave new rewards.
---
But honestly with seasons, I doubt they’ll give us shit. Maybe they’ll at least give an NW repeatable.
---
So even if you own the workshop they can one-shot you? Seems pretty wild to me.
---
I wish pacifist worked both ways, bc as it is I'm just unable to retaliate. Not that I had time to anyway.
---
Add in the whole ass KS hairdos pack.
---
I imagine on a female character it'd be the weird skirt/leggings/socks combo that you get on the BoS/Arktos labcoats. 
---
The vault suit one like James has in FO3 would be ideal, but I'd settle for the labcoat like you get in 4.
---
Agreed, I thought it would be cool if we could get some mini-power armor skins for the Secret Service Armor. You know, like how PA used to look in 3 and NV? Just make them skins for the SS Armor.
---
Hellfire is a personal favorite of mine, still need of hit 100 in Nuclear Winter for it.
---
It seemed like they planned on having seasons of NW content before they realized people aren't going to play it long enough to reach 100 multiple times. I don't think they will bring hellfire outside of that, it's currently a highly regarded reward
---
yeah its been a running joke in every game I love handing new people a iguana on a stick and seeing who gets it
---
You’re so much better off with the one that reduce melee damage
---
I know alot of people who don't play it because they dont want to wait, how ever long it takes to get in. Thats my biggest drawback too. I do play sometimes but thats why i don't play it as often.
---
A streamer could maybe do it, playing all day 5-7 days a week for those 3 weeks. A regular person with a job or school would take a few months of intense grinding in their free time lol. Even if you play with a good squad and win most matches, it takes multiple wins to rank up even by the time you get rank 20-30. Going from 90-100 is just painful
---
FPS drop is likely due to someone killing them with a tesla or energy weapon.  Ash piles are bugged as all hell right now, especially in closed environments.  Look out for the demon pixels.
---
Did you become wanted at some point and not realize it? It's about three only thing I can think of in which they could just attack without any provocation.
---
They stopped playing it because of the silly changes and food builds hiding in their indestructible bases ruined all the fun , I know this not because someone else told me but because I experienced it myself . The servers were heavily populated until that point
---
You could wear Strangler Heart armor.. then you'd look like a tree.
---
You mean we aren’t supposed to stand over you as you bleed out and then loot all your stuff /s 😒
---
They'll snap if you build them outside your house, *not* on top of a foundation.  Do this, blueprint it, then store everything and plop down the blueprint indoors.
---
What level was your deathclaw? Highest i found was a 21 regular. Highest i have seen in a camp was 90ish glowing.
---
Just 21. Never found a glowing one I could tame
---
Modus is an epic gamer confirmed
---
The lmg works but it seems unreliable at times. Lag seems to help. It's a handy tool to use when events get down to the wire or if you want to double dip Scorched Earth and Colossal Problem. Just remember to use it responsibly. My rule is if I don't launch it, I don't.melt it.
---
They completely forgot that section existed
---
Lol
---
I didn't know it did 45 but I wasn't trying to get that tight. I really want 165/170/175 or whatever that would make it fit in the camp. Youre right tho they are decently  forgiving,, what I've started doing is putting some of the prefab atom shop buildings at the edges because the fences will aaalllllllllllmost hit the edge of the buildings
---
Which, again, speaks for how people don't actually want to play it. It's a poorly implemented mode that runs counter to the actual game people were interested in that has to *bribe* people to play it, resulting in many people spending matches hiding rather than actually engaging. 
---
Thus, locking a bunch of content behind it is shitty, because it doesn't improve the game mode itself, and it means a bunch of assets that could otherwise be acquired elsewhere, aren't available.
---
You have answered your own question, you claimed a workshop
---
I’m against limits. Should be none or a really high number most wont reach
---
That’s why we keep the magic minigun 33% VATS hit chance in the strap my guy! You already know I got the OG mini in the back pocket at all times lol
---
Guess you are kinda lucky then. Sum bitch kills a dc at that high and that rare would warrant name dropping and execution of highest order. 21 regular I can find pretty quickly in a few hours and sucks, but just thinking of how much worse it could be. 
---
Sorry for your loss either way.
---
Far too often absolutely nothing is going on the map.
---
i mean if it comes to it i would just buy the plans for it i mean i have so many caps. lol
---
Agreed. I hate to see someone come in, give horrible advice, and then the OP leaves without knowing the accurate information.
---
If you own a workshop someone can come up and contest and shoot you in the back before you see them.  But you'll be notified that your workshop is being contested so get ready.  Watch your back!  
---
    There are some good youtube content creators that post a lot of pvp videos.  Very informative.  
---
Lorespade, rincewind75,jackkillsforcash, and many more
---
Probably not gonna happen honestly, but double xp weekend is the best time to use this effect. Gain all those sweet rewards.
---
Always works for me. All my junk except my fluxes go in the scrap. Well over 8K in steel now alone. Over a grand in basically everything
---
Wish there was game chat, the connection would’ve been much more real between you guys
---
That’s incorrect. See the other replies. Hopefully you’ll pass along correct information in the future.
---
iirc i think i might have added you before when acp first started. either way if you havent just add me and ill be on to do some sbq or Pp
---
 our group of 3 ( lvl 56, 64 &amp; 65 ) literally avoid that event like the plague because I don't want to piss off the higher level players, after its launch and reading all the rants on here lol
---
Dont get me wrong - we're good with doing other things instead, theres still lots to do, and eventually we will go check it out but the negativity does kinda feel like its tainted that event tbh. 
---
sorta like a " lord help you if you're a lower level and go anywhere near there " kinda vibe haha 
---
I'll stick to enjoying the game
---
if you still need a private server, you are more than welcome to use mine. Just send me your IGN and I'll add you
---
If you are on xbox and i find one, you can send me your gt and ill message you to grab it.
---
that would be pretty cool. could start as a sawed off type setup where the accuracy is pretty poor and the spread really high.
---
When I run across alcohol that I do not need, I have my character drink it anyways on the spot in order to not let it go to waste. It makes sense with my junkies build.
---
Just tried it now on the PS4. It worked after the 3-4th time. I started at the train station and worked backwards. The 3rd time it spawned people all the way at the last stretch of cottages and into the golf club. But all the other close to the hotel? Dead. Then the 4th time, all respawned. Then it was smooth sailing after
---
Probably easier to go to the market page and barter for it. I’ve only seen it once in a player vendor compared to the 20x of mounted head plans.
---
Best of luck friend!
---
Sure thing mines is Thatonedumdum- I’ll send it in a few
---
You looking to sell?
---
If it's supposed to be a high-tier reward, adding it as a fallout 1st reward would be a pretty big slap in the face tbh. Maybe if there was one for reaching level 500 in adventure mode or something, one for finishing all the (for example) combat challenges, etc. Having it at the end of seasons would also be far too easy in comparison to playing high hundreds/low-mid thousands of NW matches. 3 months of logging in every day for 15 minutes and doing dailies vs months of heavy grinding. If they do spread it out to other modes, it needs to maintain its prestige or it'll just devalue it for everybody
---
The legendary cultist blades are legacy (excluding the mailer from one violent night)
---
Private. About 4-5 times refresh killing everything
---
I mean sure. What's you're psn?
---
Its a super easy event and if you can't run it you should get good and learn how to make a build honestly
---
Did it about 2 hours ago on PS4 and worked on private. Granted, it did take about 2-3 more times more than last week
---
Hit Freddy's basement to see what legendary I can get 1st time.
---
Man the most Ghouls I can get to spawn after being nuked is 6,no more when other players arrive, no more on hopping away or returning.
---
Hm. I guess I've gotten lucky that it's literally never happened to me at a workshop before since day one.
---
But what kind of weapon can a level 70 even get to one-shot other players?
---
I left the world before he could kill it. I’m happy to say it’s alive and well
---
And yep lol I still got you added I just dropped it on acp then after that I’m dropping it on the SBQ so we can fight both Earle and queen
---
good idea, hope i can get a fair price tbh and thanks!
---
If you enter into an event then go and de-activevate in your quest menu and manage to get into the crossfire of the event.  You can activate pvp against someone who hit you with a stray shot.
---
Yes, let's leave in an exploit that allows you to harass and grief other people and leave it up to players to make the call on when it's justified. That has never caused issues before
---
I would very much like a Legate Lanius costume...they gave NCR ranger armor so it's only fair...
---
Ugh I've been playing since day one and never had it happen at a workshop that's crazy. Thanks for the tip! But for sure it's happened at train stations or my own CAMP so those are the people to report ig.
---
The mask is a rare savage divide drop, good legendary urban and forest scout armor can fetch legacy’s and top tier guns to the right buyers it’s really popular
---
lol !
---
That's wild. I guess I don't know all of these pvp features bc I never pvp.
---
Between all the visual effects and people using energy weapons it really kills people's fps.
---
Same gun a level 999 can have , and being one shot is not possible.  More like a high fire rate weapon
---
Make more things instanced / internal spawns ... include the Burrows, WestTek and others of the big interiors. Change the spawn timer and refresh on those, maybe make them group-instanced.
---
Side note ... are they going to re-balance Project Paradise for one-wasteland? Will be kinda interesting if all the trash mobs that spawn are all level 100 bastards that kill the animals you're trying to protect ;-) I can solo it today, but I can imagine trying to keep your pet alive w/ hordes of level 100 wolves, bears, honey beasts, ghouls, etc. swarming it.
---
some of it might be VATS induced tunnel vision?
---
Maybe I'll do that this afternoon then. Thanks for the tips!
---
I didn't feel bad when I did it this morning as she died with literally one minute left on the clock. But I will follow Uncle Ben's advise about power and responsibility.
---
No I don't steal or engage in pvp :( 
---
According to everyone else: this person came and contested my workshop AND shot me AND disappeared all within the 30 seconds of me owning it.
---
Wild but I guess theoretically possible.
---
I'd love to know what gun a lvl 70 can have to one-shot another player bc apparently I'm doing things wrong at lvl 110.
---
There is a certain glitch that lets you Blue print the ammo factory at the converted munitions factory that can be used in a certain way at another workshop to produce like 20k rounds an hour
---
I used to avoid pvp too.  Always got my rear end kicked.  But after a few changes to my build and gameplay pvp is very enjoying.  Gets the blood pumping.
---
Make Enclave a skin and apply to existing.
---
I hate that I find myself pulling out the gauss mini gun at the final few minutes just to make sure we don’t fail, there really should be a level cap in this event...Ammo ain’t cheap for my guns.
---
Guess I'm playing the game wrong if I don't have anything like that sheesh.
---
Thought the ones at the Airport a different color. Oh well. 
---
Knew there were others. Thanks for mentioning them.
---
200 is a myth, ANY WEAPON with the broken effects triggers it. It only overflows into instakill everything range if you hit enough consistent shots together because it keeps applying exponential damage buffs for each hit. A quad fire rate automatic laser rifle can do this if you hit enough consistent shots
---
source: i actually play the fucking game and don't blindly parrot stuff a youtuber says
---
I'd like that too but what would happen is people would just afk play all day and get xp for it... Much like I do when the seasonal drops come into NW. Time = XP in NW. Engagement = Xp for adventure.
---
There could be easy to mitigate this. You could do xp based on the fire phase. Survive each phase and you get xp. This way AFK players don't get as much xp for inactivity. But I think the NW effort is next to 0 right now and their focus is on adventure.
---
They need to fix that shit anyway.
---
It's just people getting pissy that they are shit at the game scapegoat and all on the level 30 healer
---
Also the event isn't that easy considering the 90% damage reducti, I can knock down a quarter of it's health within 1 minute but the fucking wendigos knock down my bloodied build to oblivion
---
I disagree, there are lots of enemies in the game. The problem is that they are underused (Flatwoods Monster, Behemoth) and you end up facing the same three enemies over and over again. 
---
Also they are not recycled in interesting ways. Look at Destiny 2, most bosses are kind of the similar to other bosses but they do different things. You never fight, lets say a huge Mothman, that creates a permanent shield and summons tiny mothmans that drop unique grenades to break that shield. 
---
Edit: That's just a made up example. They could do more content with the enemies they already have.
---
It would be good if she made a comment when someone makes a new character and go's out of the vault.
---
*"and the vault door opens yet again"*
---
May RNGesus be with you
---
I shall pray to godd howard.
---
Hairstyles, Beards, Tattoos (body and face), generic paint colors for all weapons and armors should all be no brainers for easy to add seasonal rewards. Or even cheap atomic shop items
---
If we are asking for a change then ask for durability to be removed completely. It serves no purpose other than an annoyance. Having to use two repair kits during the Earle fight is just stupid.
---
Or explode into a million pieces that roll down a hill.
---
Thnx
---
How much damage are you doing with that ugly pipe revolver? I got mine to 370 at 30 health
---
Somebody missed on the server I was in the other day. Somebody also launched a nuke one minute after someone else launched a nuke at the exact same spot.
---
You're welcome. =)
---
I try to get my licks on Earle in to get credit, then it's Wendigo hunting time. I HATE those fuckers! So I'm glad to do it. And rezzing is just part of the job.
---
I'll only really step back in on Earle if it seems it's taking too long to down him.
---
I have taken out level 200+ with a character level 20 with out much problem. I had one fellow come back again and again after I took his workshop. I was lol 20 some thing and they were 120 or so.  It's a way to farm caps too.
---
Nah g I think that’s a brick wall
---
I dont have master rifleman yet or master pistol cuz i didnt really spec into that as a heavy gunner but i was getting like 300 with 2 of each maxed out.
---
" Fresh meat for the grinder" 
---
- starship troopers
---
I Mean this literally, halarious when you see people getting feared and b-lining towards the drills, especially low-level/ new comers to the event.
---
What did the hot fix do?
---
Nice..its a ugly ass gun but fun to use.TY
---
Nah, the event list is in the link. Lol, my bad on the pic.
---
Good to know.
---
Have a dildo on my friends list with a trap base and glitched ammo extractors.
---
The enclave definitely are *not* raiders. We are basically what's rest of the US. I'm sure people would donate to us but MODUS scares them off.
---
That’s Mr Moneysuit, tyvm.
---
More Wendigo spawn in, right?
---
The Pannapictagraphist perk helps considerably in finding magazines.  There are guides for where they spawn, equip the perk and go nuts.
---
At end game, I've been working on perfecting Food/Chem Buffs.  I enjoy the challenge of finding the ingredients and crafting copious amounts of different chems.  Then I try to find the best stackable combination for doing max damage/getting max survivability.  Plus, you can sell off the excess for pretty good caps.  I recently made nearly a thousand Berry Mentats in one day.  Chemist/Super Duper is awesome, especially on chems that require other craftable chems because you get to double dip with those perks.
---
At the beginning of the end game my goal was to buy every plan in the game.  That really didn't take long.  Earlier in the year, my goal was to buy all the gold plans whether I needed them or not.  That kept me occupied for a good while.
---
Of course, the ACP event has been fun because I am again able to get something new.  I've already got all the plans and pretty much every gun, so anything new is always welcome.
---
Farming Fort Defiance for the Red Asylum Dress is pretty fun.  That place has a gloomy/eerie feel that I for some reason enjoy.  I just go in there and creep around looting random stuff and enjoying the vibe.  One day I'll get lucky and find that outfit myself.  So far, I have every color but red lol.
---
Lately, I've also been grinding XP for level ups/perk packs to save for getting legendary perks.  I've got 145 level ups and 45 perk packs banked, plus a ton of cards that I never use.  I hope to be able to have enough to get 900 points when the Legendary Perks are released.  That would let me get 6 level 3 cards.  I'd be ecstatic to achieve that.  It's pretty damn hard to level up though at level 500+, we'll see.  Even if I can only get 5 rank 3's, I'd be happy.
---
Since I am nearly always at or near max caps, It's fun to go out and shop for things that I want or can use in crafting.  If I don't find anything, I usually just find some low level that has vendors full of non legendary junk and just buy them out.  Then I drop the stuff on the ground for them to re-sell.  If I find some good soul who is selling stuff for cheap prices, I usually leave them some kind of gift.. A good legendary or rare plan or outfit.
---
I think i like my shotgun, handmade, and 50 cal more. I just want to spice things up. Though with the damage nerfs coming it shouldn't affect junkies as much as bloodied. I run both at once and have unyielding secret service armor so I'm supposed to be tanky... but for some reason im not. DR doesn't seem to matter at all with the presence of so many antiarmor enemies.
---
Workshops are PvP zones. If you don't want to get killed don't go in them. Pacifist mode doesn't keep people from killing you in them if you are the owner or in team with them.
---
IMO mods should just make a "Simple Questions - Todays Date" pinned post where people can ask questions that get asked every single day and don't warrant their own post.
---
Lol I think it’s pretty awesome, frame rates surprising stable actually
---
Look up chickadywickedy or however she spells it. She has a good farm route that has helped me for sure
---
Read the prompt next time you capture a workshop.
---
As a stealth sniper I try to keep the wendigo problem under control for the group
---
Your camp or a workshop?
---
Artists don't fix bugs.
---
Ammo machine 
---
Weapon of choice for your build with relevant mods
---
Secret service or t65, depending again on build
---
The other armor or maybe thorn / solar / strangler heart
---
Everything else because of your OCD completionist mania and all the other plans and maybe you want the other weapons too just maybe one day swap your build and the well sucks but it looks neat what about a bow and if you get the floater grenade plans can you drop the fuckers without the annoying message and wait dirt tiles and I think there is a backpack mod I might use one day does anyone know if smiley has reset yet and I wish they would raise the scrip limit ive crafted and now I can't scrap any more legendaries

It doesn’t bother me when I get put with low levels or newbs granted they somewhat know how to play lol. They gotta learn to beat it somehow 😆
---
It's people...
---
***IT'S PEOPLE!!!***
---
I guess I’ll give it a shot
---
I have an instigating one and two other stars I don’t remember.
---
But it's soo pretty! 😁
---
My exploding pistol doing 8 splash damage disagrees.
---
I'd be willing to trade.
---
Will do. Sorry mate 😬😬🤣
---
It says pvp while contested, but it wasn't as far as I knew. I was just building 3 objects for daily and leaving so literally was there for less than one minute and was using it when I died.
---
If I was supposed to get notified or kicked out of building, I didn't.
---
Its not a glitch if your a sneak build.  It just how sneak works.
---
Sneak damage does not apply not if the enemy is aggrod in any mannaer. AkA just one person is in "danger" and is being targeted.
---
Even if you see sneak damage alert the top left corner, damage numbers are sneak numbers on screen, and you are in caution, normal damage is still being applied NOT sneak damage. This is not limited to Earl, it is how sneak works in general.
---
When running earl solo,  it is easy to maintain a constant "caution" state. With earl not targeting anyone, full sneak damage will apply.
---
This is easily proven with a friend. Me and a buddy did earl tonight on public and on private. Public team had 8 players and it took us about 15 minutes to complete, both of us stayed hidden as much as possible, but there was a few PA users so Earl was in a constant aggro state.. 
---
Both of us run stealth builds. With just the two of us on private immediatly after the public event, we were able keep earl from being aggrod. With earl not having a target, sneak damage actually was being applied, and we finished him off in about 5 minutes total. The whole time our on screen damage numbers where the same as they were as when we ran it on public. The difference in actual applied damage was huge.
---
Not sure, I’m on Xbox with no issues
---
I run a heavy medic build with speed demon so I am reviving people alot it's the best when you pick that one guy up the the second before you die
---
Try different builds, trade for perfect gear or find people to PvP with. Other than that it's all just the same old grind. I'm kind of at the same point myself. NW and PvP have been my main reason for playing lately. NW is full of hackers on PC and not many people want to PvP. I've got 3 or 4 people I enjoy casual shootouts with but PvP is pretty hard to find. Even the hacked weapon kids don't usually fight for long once the figure out that weapons can't make up for lack of skill.
---
The trust issue was what came to mind as soon as I thought it through. I too have experienced a similar issue with the bloodied perk and I’ve also learned to compensate by firing less and waiting a second. 
---
I’m in tech but no where near games. The more I learn about FO76 the more I’m amazed at what they pulled off. So so many moving parts. I want to sit in on one of their morning stand ups to hear the various dev concerns.
---
Before patch 21 my caution counted to allow sneak criticals against the SBQ, I now do shit damage!
---
If you uninstall and re-install will it keep your characters? This may be obvious but I have never tried uninstalling a Fallout before.
---
What a man of culture you are...
---
The problem people have is that those Level 40s are taking up some of the 8 slots available in that instance, which could be filled instead with players that have end game builds. Even if they leave, it doesn't allow a properly prepared player to get in.
---
You listed two BUG topics as yours. Open, unfixed bugs. You want those retired? Get those programmers to do their damn job. Meanwhile I'll reiterate my top one, topics like this complaining about topics complaining about bugs that aren't getting fixed. It's so irritating, it's my top 3. Guess you're the stupid one for not figuring out I was listing YOUR topic as my most irritating one. So sick of people complaining about people complaining about bugs, and not the trash programmers actively ignoring the bugs or the shitty CM's who "pass it along" all the time to no avail.
---
Dude, I probably own at least 25 magic weapons and hundreds, maybe a thousand non magic ones.  I have two 450+ characters, a 358 and a 235. I've played the game more than you I dare say.  If you cared to read my post, I stated that the magic effect can be triggered based on lag and that applies to weapons with marginal to low firerates.  You aren't triggering magic with anything less than 120 firerate unless the server goes nuts.  That isn't magic, it is just bugged out code and lag.  It can't be depended on as a given.  Laser rifles can easily achieve magic with a beam splitter and even without magic suffixes if you have the armor.
---
Source: Someone who knew about magic long before it became publicized.  Go troll someone else when your pants get dry.
---
Yes
---
 https://imgur.com/qbWBU4M
---
Hmmm I must have it then ....
---
This was at a workshop and all happened within the span of about 30 seconds. I capped then immediately placed down 3 objects for my daily, opened up my map to leave and got obliterated.
---
Apparently that's possible just extremely lucky timing.
---
But I have been killed at my own CAMP before too.
---
So even if the workshop kill is "technically legit", there are still annoying players that will somehow kill me outside pvp with pacifist. Idk. Guess I need to turn off pacifist for even a chance to defend myself.
---
Its misleading, on-screen damage does not match actaul damage being applied. If you did SBQ on public your critcals never did as much as they said. Yea the screen may show good numbers, but only normal damage was being applied since she more than likely had a target and was aggrod.
---
https://youtu.be/jagOtAvr9DU
---
Good video explaining.
---
As someone who plays as a half-Deathclaw half-human character yes I agree. My Deathclaw friends do not approve.
---
Ik that. It can get u banned and its cheating
---
Apparently I've got all the wrong gear lmao. Good to know it was most likely legit though, I've just had more experience with illegitimate pvp from earlier days.
---
Picked a guy up only to be shot with acid and falling myself died instantly because acid damage kept ticking
---
i'm in aus so might be on a different schedule to you... but i'll add you and check when i get on :) i just want the xp and plans lol
---
It could get you banned, but it’s unlikely unless someone reported you for it you put em at ur camp cause then they they’re stuck there
---
That’s fair but I also use the method of trading with my mom/dad’s character and setting prices to 0 caps 😅
---
I was just thinking this! I would kill for that medic stealth suit from fallout new Vegas dlc. I loved when the inanimate objects got sassy with you.
---
Okay that is pretty badass. I wish it wasn't an atom shop item.
---
ah i am so envious.
---
Iguana on a stick is made out of people!!
---
I'm not a tech guy myself but I've managed IT R&amp;D departments and worked very closely on product design, including online game design (ages ago!), so have some idea not necessarily of the HOW, but of the WHAT.
---
The "locally forecast, server-side confirm" model gets _really_ interesting when they reconcile. For updating character movement pathing, for instance, the client is constantly averaging between the predicted and reported values to give the illusion of smooth movement without "jumping" when and update comes in that doesn't jibe with what was expected.
---
Super interesting maths in how they make it appear smooth when in fact it's relying on disjointed data coming in at intervals. So when you're playing a game with say 150ms latency (common for players around the world for US-hosted game servers), it's only getting updates an eighth of a second after the action happens. The fact that it looks smooth onscreen instead of tic-tic-ticking around the screen in little staggered teleportations is amazing.
---
But when the actions _are_ the unexpected, it just has to wait for the server to report what happened.
---
Real IT guys, feel free to nitpick the above and add detail :)
---
Im not saying it’s not cheating btw
---
As a melee build I’m glad to soak up damage on Earle, pain train the wendigo’s, and save people so they can continue the event! (Just uh watch out if I’m running and Earle is following me)
---
i love that spot! i showed it to my wife a while back and she loved it so much we hopped servers a few times to shoot them over and over lol
---
omg wait what? the plushie makes sounds???? new daily must do!
---
Whats left of a bunch of Fascists.  The Responders are the remnants of the true America.  The helping hand of a neighbor, the heroes, the call to duty.

You guys just want to fuck things up enough that you can rule over the remnants.

The game runs like butter when its not "focused"
---
Whoever is dishing out the most damage will get the aggro.
---
ohh congrats, that's the second most rare one, only surpassed by the mythical red lol
---
I mean if all the people crying about low levels were half as good as they think they are then they would be able to carry the low levels through it and still get the finish. I tag mobs at both the SBQ and CP to make sure people get their tags. I like seeing low levels their. It takes balls to hop in either of those fights and shoot it out. Some people like myself learn their build isn't that strong when they are newer to the game and it helps them in the long run.
---
Can confirm this bug still exists on xbox. Tried fuse first, tried analyzing first doesn't matter. How the hell can they screw up something so simple as a simple fetch quest?
---
I would rather see some lower levels putting in effort at an event than get a group full of high level players that don't revive anyone and try to melt the boss.
---
Yes, your 76 characters are saved server side so you won't lose them.... But you will lose your pictures.
---
Not with that attitude they dont
---
Respectfully I appreciate healers and non optimized builds but for me personally I don’t want to waste extra ammo and time. At this point with the game the way it is being a healer is appreciated but not needed. I’d like to see that change but I run bloodied builds and I typically die maybe once during this event and queens.
---
Your opinion is duly noted.  Thanks for visiting this thread that you hate.
---
Wow. That’s kind of a mindfuck to think about the disjointed nature of sever vs. client reconciliation and how it sits opposite of the disjointed reality of human perception but in the end it appears smooth-ish. 
---
I think I’m going to be paying a lot more attention to things. This conversation fits in with a thought I’ve been having about taking a deeper look into synergistic perk/buffs/stat combinations. There is a bigger picture here and I’m not able to see it beyond the stuff that’s already out there.
---
Put your weapons on your up button on the dpad. Took a bit to get used to but i no longer have this problem
---
If you want xp and a shit load of steel then yes it is
---
It's good XP, people probably stopped cause we finished the season
---
Farming ingredients is another thing I'm about to start doing too. I think making healing salve and antibiotics will be a cap generator. 
---
I have 3 of the red uniforms now. Got one 2 weeks ago when I wasn't looking on a new character! Done line in the sand, took the long way up to scrap weapons and it was just sitting there.
---
I have about 110 levels banked for the new cards. 
---
I have pretty much every weapon I need now, so I do spend a lot of time trading on here for other interesting weapons. I actually spend more time tinkering around and trading than I do actually playing the game now. But it's pretty much all I play anymore so I'm happy to invest my spare time into it when I can.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Didn’t I read on here a couple weeks ago they were going to nerf the bloodied stuff?  Will it still be super powered?
---
Yep and you don't want that to be the bloodied rifleman with little health. Imagine if it was the PA tank being tagged with the flamer heals over and over.
---
This might be the way I go.  My normal game play is sneak and I haven’t tried commando or junkie.  Thanks for the tip.
---
Server lag
---
love the "get out of the house" point you've got in that first pic, but hilarious series all the way.
---
There’s no world spawn but you can get the recipe from BIV. It can take awhile but eventually he’ll give you the nuka dark recipe. Making it is easy after that, just two nuka, Snaptail reed and water.

You don’t see the bundle till after you purchase 1 of the styles
---
You can wait and see but bloodied vats build deals crazy damage even a little nerfed. I can solo Earl and Queen in under a minute.
---
So, there's a trick to this.
---
If you and I are inside of your workshop area, and I can get you in the crosshairs without you knowing, I can hold down the build button to claim/contest it.  
---
Before the server can notify you that it's being contested, I've probably stacked enough rads on you that your are in no shape to fight back.
---
And then I eat you.
---
You guys are all talky-helpy PUSSIES. You dont do anything and you have like the most *boring* main questline in the game.
---
Exactly the same thing here realising my stealth sniper is useless for this event so I'm making a heavy build
---
nice find
---
You’ll get a Contest notice blip up in the corner of the screen for a moment.  You can die as quick as it appears.  Essentially, any time you’re in a workshop, be on high alert for PvP.  You have to acknowledge the risk upon claiming the workshop.
---
Its a random rare event, it cannot be triggered by a player.
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
My melee toon was tanking earl, pulling Wendingos off my teammates, and clearing whole packs of them, while keeping aggro 80% of the time. It was glorious,  even 8f I wasn't topping the damage parse (non bloody build). 
---
My sniper  toon,  had the entire group bail on him the ONE time I saw a nuke drop all week. He tried to solo Earle, but after the first mutation, he kept healing faster than I could dps. I was not a happy camper.
---
I'm dealing with it just fine, by ignoring it.
---
Except its not, because thats not what op was asking.
---
Oh word. Okay I genuinely had no idea about all this workshop stuff, I just capture for dailies and leave.
---
Thanks everyone pls don't eat me.
---
I thought it was cat meat or something.
---
At least we lasted the longest, and didn't get wiped out because we made our toaster mad.
---
Yes. On Retirement Plan, I sent the raider to Foundation to get some Settler rep bonus, but then immediately killed him so I can report his death to Rocksy and get some Raider rep.
---
From my experience a team of about 4 end game players can mop the beast no sweat so I don't see the problem in screaming down the mic at some random noobie because your friend can't get in
---
Time to farm
---
All the codes all ready decrypted are on nukacrypt
---
when you claim the workshop you get a warning notice that you are flagged for pvp. this was your own fault for not reading.
---
Surely we can find something we... agree on?
---
I plugged all 6 of my fusion cores from my Gatling.  Only had a 2 star shovel and a ton of stim packs.  Spent the last half of the event healing others and taking the odd swing at Earls legs.  After the event some douche was telling me I was useless and I need to pull my weight.  
---
My dude, keep worrying about yourself, I’ll still have your back and revive you.
---
No problem, it sounds like we are at about the same stage in this game.  
---
Some other drinks/chems to consider if you want to sell a few:
---
  
---
Booze, such as Ballistic Bock, High Voltage Hefe, Rad Ant Lager.
---
Radshield, 
---
Formula P, 
---
Overdrive - but it is a PITA to make.  Definitely a seller and a challenge though.  Stacks with Psycho Chems like Psychotats/Psychobuff, 
---
I also like making Company Tea, very useful but the honeycomb is really hard to find in any quantity.
---
Blight Soup is underrated but spoils too quickly to sell.
---
Have fun, hope you find some more ways to make the game interesting.
---
Edit: sorry for the boards crappy auto formatting.
---
Shoot oil spills... 🔥
---
I usually know i have enough ammo when i run out of lead or gun powder
---
Photomode clip through doors.
---
[Nope](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Iguana_Bob_Frazier)
---
I just want ultracite ammo man :(
---
Bob's Iguana Bits is made out of PEOPLE!!!!
---
An explosive weapon will do. I use explosive bow to stop enemies from attacking npc. It would be nice to have that kind of perk though, because almost everyone has explosive weapon.
---
Oh yeah, that’d be neat. Honestly I had a half serious idea kinda similar where I pitched that to a friend as a reward for the next Mischief Night, ‘costume’ T-51 and T-45 that look like F3/NV power armor that you wear as an outfit to tie in with Steel Dawn
---
No wonder Earle is always singling me out.  I thought it was my cologne.
---
I mean you’d also be pretty trim if you jogged everywhere you went
---
...he wants it pre-set to the usable max .
---
That’s a true addiction 🤣🤣
---
Okay. So why not craft some?
---
Don’t have the resources
---
Freddy’s basement?
---
So [go get some.](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
I'm more picturing ISS, Earle etc where they run rampant slapping people down. To keep them focussed on one person to the exclusion of all else is something that could be implemented.
---
I wish the default movement speed was walking, not jogging
---
I would love that
---
Oh my god that would be so slow eww
---
Nah I’ll just pay caps for it.
---
Then you need to visit some vendors in game or post this in a bartering sub.
---
Yep... 👍🏼
---
Yeah I try it out. It would not let me post. Like I said more then happy to pay for it.
---
A mod like [THIS](https://imgur.com/a/b6DNdWt) would be sweet
---
No, if you got that amount of exercise (running around and fighting all the time) and carried that much weight (armour, PA, weapons, etc), you would need all of that food and water just to keep going.   
---
I would imagine that the way Stimpaks works is by accelerating the healing process (though how it mends broken bones on the fly is nothing short of amazing, perhaps nanites from the aliens?).  So that accelerates your metabolism...
---
Don't underestimate the amount of calories that you would burn in real life if the Fallout universe was real.
---
I understand that. But this forum doesn’t allow bartering posts. You’ll need to look elsewhere.
---
Frankly, the opponent I've died to the most in this game.
---
If you don't have a solution to Assaultrons, you're missing a piece of your build.  E.g., I run a VATS build, so I use Concentrated Fire to cripple a leg and then throw enough plasma grenades to make it goo.
---
What do you prefer to run? There might be a simple solution.
---
Would love that.
---
Definitely a lot of junk in that trunk.
---
It's true.
---
this just happened to me as of today
---
-EDIT - I logged out of my world and re logged into a new one and it fixed the glitch for me.
---
Can confirm.  Stay still and don't fight back.  I promise it makes you less delicious.
---
Framerate is the overall determining factor, best test to see if the weapon is magical is to solo a sponge enemy like Earle,SBQ, or The colossus in the grove near The prime site. Higher framerates are more possible the less ppl in your general vicinity, 50 fps is when magic happens, any lower and magic starts fading or stops completely.
---
Angryturtle plays on PC and can achieve higher FPS more consistent than on consoles because of better hardware, thats why you can clearly tell when a weapon is magic, attaining magic damage is more like to occur on a PS4 Pro or XB 1X because the architectures and hardware are slightly better than previous versions.
---
Less items in stash &amp; inventory = less FPS drops
---
In your vendors there's a prompt at the bottom that will detail the key/button that will change vendors to only show what is stocked in them. That will help
---
In other players/npc vendors you'll need to just have less in your inventory, or hope their vendors aren't stacked full
---
I just logged off.double check your live subscription is good.a while back I tried everything. Erased game save then the game reinstalled just to find out my live ran out.i did have to erase my game save once before.its stored it the cloud so it will reinstall
---
You can let him go and still lie to Roxy for the rep
---
I wonder why Escape Artist would be banned. Seems like it would be useless in PvP.
---
Pasta la pizza, baby.
---
Are you using PS4 pro in non-English environment? If so, clean your stash. I don't know why it happens, but too many legendary items, plans, holos... etc, might cause this problem.
---
You have enough ammo when have no lead or steal.
---
And they’ll say they same thing they say about the scrap box: it should be part of the normal game/Todd is stealing my lunch money.
---
Lol yeah invincible in my experience
---
You really can't just shoot it and find out?
---
Heroes. Nothing is made plural by adding an apostrophe and an s.
---
I got the pink bat paint for assault rifle skin (cant remember how). Really wish I could chuck it on my fixer :/
---
I'd rather not if I don't have to
---
You lied.
---
If you get extremely lucky you can find a tamable cat at a random encounter and have 2 cats at once with Murgle. Only problem is the second cat will be level 1 and probably wont live more than a day.
---
I think I’m bloodied stealth but I can’t do any of that.  Level 241
---
Also the best xp farm in the game
---
Wait, the Emmet mountain suit is really rare? I've only done Radiation Rumble a handful of times, and got one before I got the rad barrel plans.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Level 405...
---
I make Disease Cures and Grape Mentats...  
---
Disease Cures sell like hotcakes as they tend to be hard to find in game.  
---
I have the Raider Collectron so I get a steady supply of Whiskey to make Grape Mentats.  Had to learn where the ingredients were for Mentats, though.
---
As mentioned, the cool thing about making your own chems, etc. is finding where the ingredients are in the game and visiting places that you haven't been to in a long while.
---
I'll hit you up when I see it.  Love Project Paradise.  A charmingly chaotic assortment of enemies in a funky set of linked arenas.  Requires genuine teamwork, too, which can be rewarding.
---
btw, if you go to market for a bear arm plan, I wouldn't pay more than 5k.  It's a 'stackable' so it was heavilly you-know-whated some months ago.
---
I'm with you my man.  Criticize the game and here come the downvotes smfh
---
The father winter helmet is a real shame, because it was the only rare mask I got, and was completely pointless for my non-power armor, lvl 135 character. I can't even put it in a display case for bragging rights, why?
---
I hate both of you
---
Colonel's Autumn's overcoat please!
---
Murgle will respawn tho...Considering it’s a Bethesda creation, it’s got more than nine lives. It has infinite lives
---
I'm curious, does explosive bait work on Windigos or only on animals?   Just wondering if it might be effective for the Windigo Colossus event.
---
The way I see it, for exemple when you drink 5 purified waters, you don't drink 5 bottles but 5 sip of the same bottle. It make more sense to me.
---
Its not though. Yellow excavator looks like one of those tard busses, which I guess is fitting considering most of these whiny foodbuilds likely rode one to school everyday.
---
I alternate, but also sometimes i just don't notice, the char i'm playing atm is build to be a tank, i've had 4 wendigos wailing on me and could still unload my minigun into earl before i had to deal with them.  
---
but if i see a non pa user getting swarmed i'll generally throw some lead their way.
---
Stealth bloodied commando.
---
200IQ move, report the account for harassing you.
---
I spent an hour yesterday going up to every service bell in Whispering. This post made me realize that this has not been a one-time event.
---
I'd be on the toilet all day if I ate all the dog food I do in game... All the more reason to get clean camp toilets, I suppose.
---
Lmao, with a name that ends in “Bloodied”
---
It’s ok ... load into a new world ... Murgle will be fine 😎
---
How do you have that much 5.56? I was using a furious handmade on Earle yesterday, and chewed through 3k bullets with 2 people helping me.
---
I wish I would have seen this before the other person's comment :(
---
I think the issue is basically like said, too many items in your inventory/stash. If you think about what has to be loaded, lets compare weapons/armor to junk/aid. Junk doesn't have many characteristics(weight, value, scrap material, name). Aid tends to have more values attached(weight, value, name, rads, buffs, HP/AP, spoilage). Then when you have armor and weapons, they both tend to have numerous stats(that also can't be stacked because of durability) attached so at my guess, would cause the game to have to load much more data each time.
---
wait some time. It'll come back
---
I have several times. Reported on the game and reported to Microsoft. For the most part I just started ignoring them. I think it’s similar to the election spam calls we all get this time of year. I block all the numbers that call but somehow they manage to keep calling from the same numbers. On the upside if they’re serious about talkin about me on reddit my user id here isn’t the same as my gamer tag.
---
I think it was part of the communist camp bundle. But it might have been sold separately as a timed exclusive. I don’t remember. But I do remember that it’s better to be dead than red.
---
I actually got it figured out. Just took saving and exiting ~15 times to get it working. Thank you so much! You’re so kind for offering
---
Was going to say this as well, but ... i only shoot one car, the blue fusion flea, it set's off all but two cars :p
---
Forbidden knowledge. Goddamnit if I don't need to deliver these brotherhood files . I've only gotten 1 bos paint plan but who cares brotherhood needs them plans and also walking around camp venture is nice.
---
I saw that. I was thinking they put you through a test first, with random creatures, bare fist.
---
I love launching artillery strikes at a Blood Eagle roadblock near my C.A.M.P (due east of the R.G station). 
---
I also constantly do Enclave events, as I hope to one day receive a forest scout mask.
---
Ahh makes sense.
---
Over the past week, I think I've seen 3 different people miss the mine
---
It's a quest location in becket's line, and a place you can end up after nukashine.
---
Yes that is a "magic" gun.   
---
I am going to add something others may or may not know TS FFR heavy guns are magical also. The requirement for it to be magical is that it has to have an accel barrel so this is limited to TS FFR gauss and TS FFR miniguns. I tested with the 15% block and in PA,  while a bit less reliable in PA it will still proc the magic.   
---
Now if only people would keep the damn wendigos off me so I don't stagger I could kill earle in 30 seconds instead of a minute.
---
Just did this today. Worked well until 3 people left mid event.
---
Are you sure some sneaky player didn't reverse pick pocket you and just place a plasma grenade in your pocket?
---
Yes!!! I would also love to see a mod that allows you to stun targets in front of you, like that guy from Rainbow 6 siege.
---
I think this has a place in the game.  Gotta roll in the wasteland how you wanna roll in the wasteland.
---
I carry a Light Machine Gun just for Assaultrons.
---
Doing this mission on my new character and the problem is still here on 09/02, PS4
---
Classic hairstyles
---
Level 60 something. With the right buffs im slapping 3k damage. 
---
I punch Earl a couple times and then I'm a marsupial savior to everyone. 
---
Jamming drugs into people from a 30 foot jump, knocking wendigos back with my powerfist.
---
Hellyeah.
---
On PS4, still bugged as of 09/02
---
Ok
---
Speed Demon keeps my metabolism overclocked, the food and drink necessity makes sense from that perspective.
---
My Two Shot Faster Fire Rate mini-gun (non explosive) with accelerated barrel does 3 to 6 damage per shot on Earl with full heavy gunner perks.  The only reason why I use it over my Junkies or Vampires .50 cal (20 to 30 damage)  is because my minigun has a magic prefix (+33% VATs) which means that it ends up doing way more damage than it should (magic effect).
---
For non-magic weapons I find that you are better off with a good .50 cal than a Minigun when going up against end game bosses.  As for the energy weapons, I've seen a lot of posts recently that indicate that killing the Windigos and creating goo and ash piles causes a lot of lag in the Colossal Problem event.
---
Basically, you'll get more out of the heavy gunner perks with a .50 cal automatic, gatling laser, or gatling plasma, than you will with the minigun.
---
I don't even loot the wendies and I tend to run ad clear. Mostly because I don't play bloodied or use magic weapons so my Earle contribution is minimal anyway, but at least I'm doing my part!
---
Oh I don't disagree.
---
Hell, as a Heavy PA user, I can solo the Event myself, it just takes a while. Any other players helping on the boss or adds just cuts the time down.
---
Really nice build. Mojave outpost was also real cool
---
Trade , buy &amp; craft . During Fasnacht i made around 500k ultracite ammo trading for masks lmao
---
I agree ... and I’m starting to think I may have a “few” things I NEED to do in game 🤣🤣
---
Along with Guided Meditation it's one of the most efficient XP farms, as far as events go. On the last DXP, with Cranberry Relish, Leader Bobblehead, Inspirational, 4 Lunchboxes, INT boosts, etc, I went up almost 4 levels on LitS. I was in the high 700's at that time so that's about 115-120,000 XP per level... It's insane. Even without DXP and Lunchboxes, I can still rely on a level gain at level 841.
---
&gt;1Urban armor or mask
---
It looks like this:

Lmao that’s actually amazing; I too had long wondered where the iguanas were coming from
---
Thank you
---
*Can't trust advice from Wendigo.*
---
;)
---
Hahahahaha, that’s awesome ... as for the Mask ... bought mine way back when it was available in Enclave Bunker ... bought and sold a few since they went to a rare drop
---
Fuck the Brotherhood?
---
Definitely worth it for some weapons as you get a lot more ammo when you craft. For example, when you craft normal .308 round you get like 20 or something and for a little flux you can craft Ultracite .308 and make somewhere around 120 I believe. Just look into the weapon you’re using and make sure it’s worth the cost.
---
Have these been fucked too now?
---
My number one is definitely "I finally launched a nuke after 200 levels and it took me three hours". Nuking is not hard in this game hell i launched my first one before level 60 it is just a normal part of the game and I pretty much consider it karma wh0ring
---
Oh okay thanks man
---
I am in my first nuked Foundation right now and it is glorious. They just keep on truckin’.
---
Shouldn't we all be wendigos then?
---
Same. I hope they add them back to MODUS's inventory considering Vault raids have been cann d.
---
My main guns utilize .45 and 5.56, so I'll have to look into what the difference is.
---
I'd rather have it as a perk or armor legendary effect.
---
i see, thanks for the tip!
---
But are the mats cost the same? The steel, gunpowder etc?
---
My items is as much as before but I have not experienced this problem before
---
Me and my friends have had the same problem, i dont get it.
---
I am playing on pc
---
he's doing it to double dip in the rep reward.
---
Aim their legs, or come close to melee range. If you have blocking perk, its easy to deal with them in melee.
---
It’s a little more steel and gunpowder but not by much for the amount of ammo you get. Really depends on the weapon you use.
---
I use the exact same but only my .45 is Ultracite. Worth it imo but I haven’t crafted 5.56 yet
---
It's possible that his base ended up in a nuke zone and was blown up.  The Colossal Problem event spawns at Manonga Mine which is near there and needs to be nuked to start the event.
---
Likely he didn't fix his CAMP before leaving the world.
---
🤣🤣🤣 thanks for the laugh
---
You'd also be dead if you fought a gigant irradiated bat, or a walking burnt ballsack
---
Its definitely real I can't log in to my account on xbox. I am really hoping it's a mistake, but like I said they haven't responded to me and it has been a week😞
---
PC? You can add me. I want to test the ceiling of my build anyway we can run together.
---
I put it on one of my big guns, I grab it if I'm going to do events but I don't carry it with me all the time. I don't grind SBQ but I go sometimes and I always go grab that gun.
---
But I would say it's not really worth it as a filthy casual myself.
---
Ok i will make it show stocked items only
---
A few things helping me out here:
---
 
---
* Ammosmith, Scrapper, and Super Duper perks
---
* My camp is on the lead deposit in the mountains just west of Pleasant Valley, so I get a trickle of free lead while I play
---
* I have FO1st and work from home, so I will occasionally jump on my private server to do a tin can run while my code is compiling
---
* I’m also near the cap cap so if I see a good amount of 5.56 in a vendor I’m buying all of it
---
* If you kill the wendigo spawns you will often get the same ammo type back
---
Fixers are considered to have a legendary effect even for the ordinary versions.  So they can't be scrapped.  They can only be dropped or sold.
---
Basically, Fixers are a special version of the Combat Rifle.  
---
If you are looking to learn mods for the fixer, you'll need to find the mod plans for the combat rifle or scrap a bunch of combat rifles, either by picking them up or by crafting them and then scrapping them.
---
I usually end up doing crowd control on the spawns because there are so many, and I just kind of get stuck doing it. since I use a vampire weapon I'm always pretty high in health so I don't mind using a few stimpaks to revive fellow players.
---
Hours of hot sweaty college teens
---
Yeah fuck the  brotherhood! Me and my homies hate the BOS
---
Interesting ok I'll have to try agian later...
---
Dunno but I have noticed speed demon seems to randomly stop working now. Didn't used to be like that.
---
***Possibly not true for the stick version on the east coast.***
---
Because, well, iguana on a stick in earlier Fallouts looks like...  [An iguana on a stick.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Iguana-on-a-stick_(Fallout_3))
---
The bits however, those are probably people.  So some of it is iguana, some of it isn't.  Wouldn't trust the iguana *bits* on a stick though.  Looks like ghoul bits.
---
Get a shotgun and slot in "Enforcer" They are much easier when they can't get up. if you use vats slot in "concentrated fire" as well to auto target limbs. this should make life easier for you.
---
All good options :)
---
You lose a % of the money u make.
---
Vending machine tax
---
Everyone sees it, my dude. You only get 90% of the sale.
---
Don't feel bad, I'm lvl 200 and apparently I have the wrong perks &amp; wrong weapons too. 😶
---
the jet pack is a must have, power armor or no power armor there is a option for it 
---
other then that i would save the gold and treasury notes because they are going to be selling alot more things soonish including lunchboxes i have one character right now that has maxed gold and im saving it for the new content instead of wasting it on things i dont want/need
---
There are high levels that aren’t optimized to full damage as well, you know, people who don’t play the typical min max builds. More people joining bumps up the boss health and difficult (more spawns). 
---
An instance event means you’re stuck with the same 7 people throughout the fight, even if they leave, no new players can join. 
---
So imagine being able to contribute to chipping the boss health but not enough to solo in time, and finding yourself in a instance with other players that cannot do damage at all. No one likes to fail an event after wasting a bunch of resources. 
---
It was the same during the first few months of fighting SBQ when the majority wasn’t ready for end game content.
---
m8, it sounds illogical but the masks dont drop from enclave events. 
---
they drop from savage divide events. as far as I read about they drop from uranium fever, guided meditation and one violent night, all in the savage divide.
---
some people also claim that they drop from any the messenger event, doesnt matter where it takes place.
---
but they dont drop from enclave events. 
---
btw they drop as a bundle: both masks and 3 jumpsuits: whitespring, white powder and bos jumpsuits.
---
Bell at the Wayward 👍
---
I just finished a couple hours ago. It's such a relief. Now I can put some time into C.A.M.P. renovations and stash management.
---
are you guys still having the problem??
---
Fortune cookie says: 'That really wasn't iguana...'
---
Think a shotgun fires 8 shots. If you do the challenge for vat crit hits, a shotgun gives you 8 towards your total per critical hit
---
I have 15 years of experience in mmo's. I can confirm, yes, fast killing is not bad. IF, and here is the big if. If it's because of clever group composition. Group buffs, debuffs, builds etc. Not because someone bought a hacked gun you can just hold one button for 3 sec and boss dead.
---
Fallout has good in theory when it comes to group compositions. They have both healing and debuffs. But this is not needed when you oneshot a boss.
---
Fallout has tank speccs. This is not needed when you oneshot a boss.
---
Fallout has a lot of aoe stuff.. This is not needed when stacking and taunting mobs isn't a thing, and during events, you sit and wait for a mob to spawn, just for one bullet hit and dead and wave cant spawn fast enugh.
---
This game does not currently work towards group compositions at all, other than that you get more xp and some shared cards that make you save some caps. The only fun left in my opinion, is the collection, exploration, atmosphere and community. Group compositions arent a thing and probably will never be either, specially due to the extreme amount of both physically and mentally pain you have to go through to be able to change your build.
---
So the ONLY "group comp" that is working atm, is multiple players cooperate with their own build, play as you want. Which results in people using medicore builds, and one or two people with top tier meta builds.  During this, a boss fight is challenging if there is less players and no meta builds, and can be a bit too easy if the two meta build guys kill boss super fast.
---
But this can be sorted with pure balance and a bit redesign. But as long as bethesda allows hacking in the game, it will never be a balance towards legit players and this is sad!
---
Why does my mind immediately go to the mechanics involved for breeding such a monstrosity...
---
What exploit? :D. This game have been exploited since day one and still is. Are you playing this game at all? No offence.
---
I have heard about the Savage divide thing, but I've never heard of the bundle drop. Any chance there's a spreadsheet floating around that has the drop chances of these items?
---
Im not talking about a non legendary scorch queen. Im talking about a collosal problem. And thats one out of 200 exploits out there, and if you read patch notes, there is always a fix for exploit trying to fix it. Im asking to ban the players and be more strict.
---
U know Bethesda is skimming off the top!!!
---
You have my attention. Proceed mr sir.
---
My average is around 1200 screws to learn all the mods for a radium rifle. Did it on 2 characters. Those screws took me basically 2years to accumulate. After, what 2 weeks?, of this event, I am well over 4k screws across all my alts.
---
The point is, whats the purpose of the insane years of grinding to get legendary perks, level and best in slot weapons, when you can just buy it all for a few irl bucks out of a hacker? I'm not defending this game design, it's a complete failure, but at least make everyone on the same page.
---
“And then I eat you” 🤣🤣🤣
---
That’s the **BEST** fucking ending to a post I’ve ever read 😎
---
Boi 👏🏻
---
Seems the ui glitches, sometimes I see scrap values instead of damage.
---
Lol first world problems
---
What?
---
I'm not saying this game design is perfect and it should reward noobs. But raising the floor and lower the ceiling, is the most common shit you will find in any games out there and it's working and make the players happy.
---
You are supporting scammers by writing this to me. You are saying that you rather want to accept a shitty game design to counter it with exploiting so you dont have to play the game the way it's designed. And on top of that, you calling me personal stuff that has nothing to do with the game or not. This game is not ment for pro gamers, and that 2 sec delay everytime you shoot an enemy, shows that. It's not for casuals either, and the 2 years of grinding shows that. It's for medicore players so they should balance the game towards that as well. And exploiting is not medicore.
---
Oh ya, EVERY time ... and Duchess doesn’t seem to care
---
Yup, and way more fun too in my opinion. Nothing like going to town on a pack of ghouls with a giant blender.
---
If you see a level 44 girlscout chasing you around, I’m just trying to do the tadpole ally quest lol
---
You radium rifle guys are a little kooky.
---
Agreed.

Lord Howard takes 10% tribute from all vendor sales.

Was this like an hour ago on xbox and like 8-10 lunch boxes were popped? If so I was the pink cosmonaut with the penta gauss.
---
Maybe those high lvl tanks need to move onto a private server where they can do this event to their hearts content, in private.
---
On a public server, it is a public event and anyone should feel free to participate. I'm only a level 200, I don't play on a team and even I'm intimidated and haven't tried this event. If necessary, when I do go in, I'm turning off my mic so I don't hear people screaming at me because I don't know how to do the event yet. Everyone should feel free to enjoy the game their way, without being intimidated by other players.
---
Eh give em the benefit of the doubt I think they just got kicked, either from the instance or the server
---
It was an hour ago, yes. However it was on the ps4.
---
Because of how many people have sexualized Deathclaws.
---
Ahh
---
"Higher" level player here. This probably wont be well recieved but I feel like it should be said.
---
I much prefer that level 22 firing every last one of his/her .38 rounds into deaths screaming face while the mine crumbles around them to that level 70 something scumbag who things his/her levels are what matters with a trash build trying to blame the rest of the team for not being able to carry them. Killing a couple wendigos doesnt count as a contribution, if someone can do a meaningful chunk of damage to Earle, they can kill wendigos. Maybe if people would stop parroting posts about it being the "low levels" fault, they would realize THEY failed the event too. And then maybe they would work towards getting stronger, and then maybe they won't fail it again. 
---
Just some dumb level 397s opinion. Maybe I just play with a group of overpowered team mates, but then again, we dont go in solo hoping the rest of the team will be able to complete the event for us.
---
They definitely can be killed. Tho there are a couple in the world that cannot, like the one at wixton homestead, but you also can't tame him.
---
Workshops and notifications have been pretty buggy for me at times. Many show up as unowned even though they are and I've had friends contest the workshop with no notification until well after. I can't say what happened in your case but you can be standing outside the workshop zone and still get killed if you are close enough when someone contests it.
---
So much effort to look right and he just looks like even more of a twat
---
I also really want to have a cat
---
Serious?  So do you tack on 10% to the item you’re gonna sell?  Pass it on to the shopper lol
---
I have a new build I'm working on strictly for PvP. Raider armour and going to basically take over every workshop I can. I'm always a friendly player and will be on all my other characters. But... It sounds fun and I look forward to being a raider and causing a little chaos. Have a melee, junkie, bloodied and full health already.
---
Depends on if you can get the flux
---
Place a 1st tent to bug the spawn points, and then unload on the mass "drop". Love doing it solo with a VE gat plasma. Easy kills, and usually at least a couple of Pleasant Valley claim tix.
---
Nice. I will have a look when I'm off work.
---
Get your tags and clear wendigos off of people. You don't have to do tons of damage, just find a way to be useful. That seems to be the biggest issue for a lot of the lower dps builds. As someone that runs several bloodied builds have someone that clears mobs so I can focus on the boss is a god send.
---
I guess I would say that the one thing that I do EVERY time I see it is gather flux.  If there is a Nuke Zone then I go into flux farming mode.  
---
It's one of the disappointing things about the Colossal Problem Event, there is no good nuke zone for flux near Manonga Mine.  It's like the Developers deliberately did their best to find the worst spot on the map to nuke for flux and selected it for the event.  The least that they could have done is seeded the area with more flux plants.
---
It used to be Campfire Tales.  Not for the badge, that's just a side benefit, but for the Acid.  It used to be that you could extend the timers out to about 90 minutes by maxing out each stage and you ended up picking up about 900 acid by the end.  But they killed that when they reduced the timer to about 30 minutes.
---
It also used to be Uranium Fever for legendary script but I seem to be swimming in legendaries to script these days.  Also, I'm tired of the new players who like to one-shot everything, including the legendary spawns at the event.  There seems to be more selfish players than ever before, not willing to let everyone get a shot in.  We used to have a pretty vocal community, calling players out on their behaviour on mics, etc. on the PS4.  There seems to be less of this.
---
Chemist backpack mod, SS chest and jetpack, SS underarmor and shielded mod.  For my 2nd character this is the full list of stuff I'm gonna get, only played a 2nd to side with the Settlers and get both story lines.
---
That will be part of the fun... Scouring the wasteland and just traveling like a lone wanderer again. I'll definitely try to not use fast travel and role play more instead of hopping and grinding to eventual boredom.
---
where is ceases legs on for example
---
Bethesda: "No."
---
Any tats that aren’t on the forehead. Those always looks so damn ugly
---
I have started ballistic bock and have a dozen or so, but yet to get formula P and a lot of others. Maybe in time I'll just make my main a bloodied commando/salesman as I have the chem backpack too. Maybe swap a few perks into strength and tweak my armour. And thanks.

Really depends on what weapon you're gonna use.
---
Pc here, i would need mad mouse acceleration for that
---
https://youtu.be/hIItKekZzIc

You’re completely wrong in every aspect
---
Honestly, just the ammo lol 
---
Seriously though, the flamer is the best CC to use and reviving is super useful especially more so when he's nearly dead
---
Plasma weapons don’t make the game unplayable,  weapons that make ash piles are the devil right now unfortunately.  Even Line in the sand wasn’t safe yesterday,  those Tesla’s are brutal.
---
Rookie numbers.. I somehow managed over 700 in 2 runs lol
---
Have you seen a shotgun cartridge?  It shoots one thing that then splits into multiple things.  It doesn't shoot 8 things.
---
Definitely worth priming the .45. On the other hand, 5.56 is so common and available I didnt have to prime. My 5.56 was my secondary though so I use it less than the 45.
---
Personally, I’m using Daddy-O, Daytripper, Mentats, Formula P and Overdrive addictions. It frees me up to use Psychobuff and Ballistic Bock (whenever I get that recipe) for major damage. You could replace Mentats with something else if you use those a lot.
---
So you are saying that because it's doable, it's allowed? So if I'm able to beat someone up irl, I can do it because I can?
---
It's about principle. This game is all about community as far as I understand it. So why can't we be a good community and stay together? Yes, Bethesda fails on so many things and this game is a scam we can all agree. But I don't think hacking a game should be allowed anyway. If people find a glitch and use that, sure I can live with that. But hacked weapons? Really? Common. Btw you hard reported for supporting exploiters and I assume you got permabanned before as well, which is why you are speaking on a brand new account now? I'm gonna make sure non of your accounts will survive, good luck.
---
Vampire ffr heavy weapon can tank a direct laser attack, even the imposter
---
There’s a ultracite laser rifle in NW?? Is it from hacking terminals?
---
This is a game buddy, what’s your point? Everything you’ve said is wrong in terms of what op is referring to
---
Formula p, mentats, daytripper, daddy-o, and alcohol. Those are my 5, doesn't touch strength, endurance, or endurance
---
Thats...  not what I was talking about.
---
It was explained in fallout 2 that it's human flesh
---
You don't have to run out of the mine when Earle is killed. Loot some baby wendigos and hangout til the dust comes. You only lose out on the lackluster crate rewards.
---
Brighter color lights would be nice too. I'd like a more functional red
---
If you are a casual player I’d say no - the main reason for ultracite ammo for me is to be more efficient in SBQ and ACP - I don’t usually use ultracite out of those events that much. 
---
Just try and max out your rep with raiders and get the ammo factory from them... and keep a vending machine open and buy rounds from other players with the caps u make from yours.
---
Some uranium fever and mole miners in particular and you will never need to craft or buy them
---
Ya, one shotters can be a pain... completely depends on player ... went to do AWOL ... normally I’m alone ... this time 2 others were there ... it was obvious we could all take out mobs easily ... so I was a little nervous about the last Legendary... saw it 1st .. shot once ... others shot once after ... we were all making sure each got a hit ... lol  ... Xbox btw ... don’t think that makes a difference??
---
Just go to your armor bench and you can see the difference (assuming you have unlocked a prime receiver for that ammo type) ... some of them are significantly less - I.e. .308 as another comment said
---
i... I've been eating it for so long.. its so tasty.
---
You dont lose your damage bonus when you temporarily get cured of your addiction for the duration of your chem. I'd recommend Alcohol and mentats specifically because their withdrawal effects are pretty minor.
---
I'm a solo 79 and I do a good chunk of damage sometimes more than the power armour tank builds was playing the event today with the  5others and nobody not one would heal me on the escape tunnel everyone ran and left me now kn a low level team I don't even see the respawn screen
---
It would be impossible to account for all the armor pieces clipping
---
Lucklaster crate rewards? What does that mean?
---
And I thought it we didn’t escape in time we would get crushed to death and lose all our loot and fail the event.
---
I'm just being pessimistic. I still haven't completed that event because everyone just seems to give up about half way through.
---
Knight Moreno to I guess no one... If any brothers pick this up EL-7 is gold, I repeat EL-7. We have no idea how many are in the cave, but they're definitely hostiles in there... God help us.
---
I have an op weapon from ages ago plus all the perks when I was trying to become a jack off all trades never put them to use till now
---
Ghouls are more dangerous than deathclaws in fo76 sadly
---
Twice this week I've had to use explosive bait on someone's camp. One, I was spawned inside their locked camp and had to blow the door off, and second, someone put a stool right in front of their chemistry bench so it couldn't be used. Felt like the right thing to do in both cases haha.
---
Sorry wasn’t home asking these questions
---
It's nice when an ember the size of a .45 round falls down and burns like a volcano
---
Use asbestos lining in torso to ignore ceiling fire damage or equip fireproof.   Thanks YouTube.
---
Never tried it but I could probably kill it 2 man if someone else would kill the wendigos only problem is I constantly die because of my refusal to wear power armour
---
Sneak lever bloodied build.
---
Typically focus the adds.
---
However...
---
I also equip suppressor perk, friendly fire, and my wonderful suppressor shishky. 
---
Between add waves I go tag Earle, then run around giving my team some love. Heals those other folks right up. And Earle just got neutered for a bit.
---
Could I just focus Earle? Yep. But I've always enjoyed a support role and this event benefits from it.
---
Then count me among your homies!  ...just please try and be a smidge less fascist. Promise?
---
PvP can be a lot of fun. A good player is more challenging than any boss in the game. I love fighting without legacies or teslas. Having to aim makes it a lot more fun and challenging. I wish more people would give it a try because I think a lot of people would enjoy it. It's just not an easy thing to ease into especially on PC. I've run across several people that wanted to fight with shovels, bare fist and naked, and so on. The Fed76 group had a big Civil War re-enactment battle with black powder weapons that looked like a ton of fun. If you are on PC and want to have a friendly PvP match let me know.
---
Casual, absolutely not.
---
I had the laggy stash issue, cleaned out all my unimportant holos and notes and my stash has been fine since. I don't collect notes and holos anymore, I drop them once I use them.
---
Not in the slightest, except *maybe* for .308 and fusion/plasma cores.
---
Completely depends on your build and playstyle. There is no right answer any player here can give you as you didn't tell us your build.
---
You need to choose 5 addictions **that least affect you and your playstyle/build**. Meaning if you were a stealth commando, and therefore your main specials would be PER and AGI (maybe LCK too depending if you are using crit build) then you would want to choose addictions that don't lower those specials. Or if you were a melee character you would not want addictions that affect your STR as it increases your damage etc etc.
---
[Here you can see all the addictions and their effects on specials](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction#Fallout_76)

---
I'm level 50 so I'm not the much help, but about a week ago I found a loot bag with plans, guns, and most importantly, around 500 frag/pulse mines. So when i first went into the event and noticed that im extremely underpowered, i was running around throwing mines everywhere and reviving players, and it worked out very well. Might have made the game run at 10 frames but we beat it
---
No way it could have been bannable.. all you had to do was leave the building and go back in!
---
I just want the screws and 'Quack Surgeon' means I don't have to use stimpaks.
---
Damn, I'm on PS4. And that did sound a lot of fun. I need to check out fed76 as I've seen it on here a few times. Once I'm off work I'm going to go through my characters and try and make a decent armour set-up and trade so I can get a matching set. But raider is sounding pretty fun.

Whenever I see a murgle camp, I kill it and cook it into a cat meat steak, then find the camp owner and do the gift emote and leave the steak at their feet.

Last time i traveld that way she was dead :(

If your going for a perception build get addicted to the ones that take away anything but perception. Vice versa for strength. And then true junkie builds pick a chem or few to activly use so youll end up with 6+ addictions.
---
Gross. A heavy guns build with 8 charisma

I usually wait for 3 days ... than do all 3 👍🏼
---
I used the following link to select which chems to become addicted to.  What you select will depend on your build and your style of play.
---
For example, I play a heavy gunner build so I have a lot of SPECIAL points in Strength.  So my first two addictions were Buffout and Psycho, because I could afford the -1 STR for each as it doesn't affect the damage that I do with heavy guns, just carry weight.
---
The point is to find addictions that does not weaken your play style.

But... In real life, if you want to repair a gun you can source the parts from either another gun that’s also in bad condition or you can source gun parts from elsewhere.
---
I’m in a similar situation, but with WWR armor that gives me a large inventory, creating lag. Interior buildings usually give me more trouble, and I found “The Deep” earlier. On my lesser system, I get up to 15 second freezes due to server load so my only chance is PA to live through the game stutter...

I mean, if you didn’t have to buy the game in the first place, yeah! Limits all the way and pay to bypass them. But this isn’t some shitty free to play mobile game. This is (apparently) a triple A game some of us paid £60+ for. These time gated grinds are indeed bullshit.

There are plenty of folks that will PvP on console. I wish people on PC were a little more lighthearted about it. I contested a workshop of a level 200+ player and was just throwing meat cleavers. They just ran out of the workshop and wouldn't even shoot back.

If anything it's more
---
There should be one on the way I heard
---
So just more skins of everything?

Swear to TODD a wendigo whispered that in my ear

well good thing because actual iguana on a stick is...actually a full lizard on a literal stick

You're doing it right, ammo 1cap. I don't normally increase the price to compensate for items in selling in the vendors. What in selling in vendors are usually mid to lower end. High end items are usually kept for trades

So an IE lmg is magic?

Most clothing gives you no materials when scrapped. Military Fatigues is the only piece of clothing I've found that spawns naturally in-game that scraps for 1 cloth. I haven't scrapped any of the Atomic Store clothing that you craft, but my guess is most cost more materials to make than you'd get back even with Super Duper taken into account.
---
This is me. Just it’s all bells I come across.... don’t know why but someone has to ring them.

Your incredibly lucky, maybe it's the platform your on idk but Xbox users are ruthless my level 50 friend gets these sorts of people a lot on this event plus a weird encounter with some guy who tried to scam him for a regular hand made for 5k he said no, after that the scammer said he wasted his time and sent him some pretty fucked up shit
---
Also consider the relative time in-game as well.
---
I rarely eat or drink more than 2-3 times during a game day/night cycle.
---
It can be annoying, but probably more realistic than you think.

Did you just get done using the camera? Not photo mode through the map, but the one in your inventory.
---
You mean from all melee/unarmed weapons? People do use vats a lot in melee. Particularly in the ever so lacking unarmed category. Those bloodied/sneak unarmed builds that make no fucking since kinda utilize the stalkers effect to a point. Abuse of vats, chameleon armor and a bloodied powerfist? Just a stalkers build with more damage.
---
So that’s why all the Chally outfits are dirty...
---
Im only level 68 but i have over 200 stimpaks so i try to help revive players (especially the really high level players) when i can

Stalkers has no effect at all on distance for melee since you actually have to be close no matter what. Stalkers on melee is never going to be good and you can’t explain how it ever could when it never can

---
This absolutely! Bethesda also needs to change damage weight calculations so that they're intuitive and consistent. 
---
Much like with the damage nerfs that simplified damage buff calculations, weight reduction buffs should be reworked to be the same way. There's no way in the world someone picking up a weapon with mods for the first time is going to know what the base weight of that weapon to calculate weight reduction off that.
---
I second the use of Enforcer. It makes the game almost unfairly easy when dealing with bipeds, whether living or robotic. With all three levels of Enforcer you can usually put an enemy on the ground in 4 or 5 shots, max, and finish it off at your leisure.

Different people.

Blocker is awesome for any build tho

This game is a mobile game though. If you start to think of it as such all the design decisions make sense. I’m pretty sure Bethesda Austin used to be a mobile game dev team prior to as well.

BattleCry Studios was founded on October 3, 2012, as subsidiary of ZeniMax Media, headed by Rich Vogel as its president.[1] Initially, BattleCry Studios was seeking employees with experience in microtransactions and free-to-play games.[2]

On May 28, 2014, BattleCry Studios announced their first game, BattleCry.[3] On September 10, 2015, it was reported that BattleCry Studios had laid off a "substantial portion" of their staff.[4] On October 7, 2015, the development on BattleCry was halted for the studio to work on different projects.[5] One of the studio's first projects following the hold of BattleCry was the modification and restructuring of Bethesda's Creation Engine (in conjunction with sister company id Software, utilizing netcode from Quake) to support multiplayer functionality in anticipation of then upcoming Fallout 76.[6] In September 2017, Vogel announced that he had left BattleCry Studios in favor of Certain Affinity.[7]

Never said it was good. Just comparing the bloodied/unarmed builds people run to the stalkers effect on melee. Its the same thing. Bloodied/unarmed higher dps, a reliance on sneak and vats. Stalkers lower dps, a reliance on sneak and vats.

I use bloodied/unarmed as the example because people tend to run those a lot. In theory, neither should be viable builds. But one is and the other isn't? I run a 2h melee character and I don't like seeing that as the effect. 
---
Not letting my personal dislike blind my judgment over the builds/effect or lack of practicality in the game.
---
Mate, I'm not saying it's justified, but if you're trying to sell single action revolver ivory grips for 200 caps and shotgun shells for 5 caps each, it's justified. 
---
Came across a camp last week that was trying to sell purified water for 12 caps a piece and was trying to sell a 1 star assassin's gauss rifle for 1400 caps. I ran the Bravo Silo just to nuke their camp... Some times its about sending a message.
---
If anyone disputes that I'll show up at there door and shove a 50 cal In their face... irl.
---
Issue is more people that aren't contributing as much makes more wendigos spawn, unless they have the common sense to stay in stealth with a silenced weapon.
---
Usually doesn't bother me too much, but if no one else is clearing them and we've got low levels plinking Earle and dying repeatedly, then I'm spending almost 50% of my time dealing with wendigos and losing dps on Earle.
---
The calmest battles are usually when there is a 2:1 or higher stealth commando to heavy ratio. Stealth commandos don't add to wendigo spawns. The few heavies contribute consistent damsge, while drawing  enough wendigos to make the fight interesting.
---
It just gets *really* busy when there's a bunch of lower level power armoured players in there. I'm confident enough in my build to say that won't ever mean a loss, but it makes the fight less enjoyable.
---
Ya rly
---
Ok maybe behemoths instead
---
First things first.
---
Redo the XP system so killing someone awards more than 10 shitty XP I can get by hiding for thirty seconds. 20 if I also down the dude. When you’re a perked and kitted sniper or a commando it’s not difficult.
---
Second, perks shouldn’t exist. At all. Frog legs is fucking ridiculous, and takes all the fun out of a straight shootout because it’s pretty damn difficult to aim my combat rifle at the dude with a .50 cal raining lead on me while jumping about like a fucking kangaroo. If I build myself right, I can wipe out an entire squad in 12 seconds without breaking a sweat. That needs to change. Killing four people at once should be much more difficult if not impossible.
---
Third, rework power armor. Power armor should be a genuinely scary thing to come across. As it is, I would rather go naked than use a suit of power armor. Power armor is a big target, it’s loud so impossible to be stealthy in, and the damage resistance simply isn’t worth the trade off. It is a suit made of several inches of reinforced steel! It should fucking act like it.
---
Fourth, disable VATS entirely in NW. I get it, VATS is an iconic part of the Fallout franchise, but it has no place in a competitive environment - it’s practically an aimbot/detection hybrid. You can’t use it on players which is a start, but if I throw a grenade at you, you’re not dodging it because I can VATS it to kill you.
---
Fifth, the ghillie outfit is totally overpowered. I can bush camp with a ghillie skinned hunting rifle, and you won’t know anything until your head is blown off in a haze of pinkish red mist. And not everyone had the ability to spend hours grinding for that thing - especially not if they turned up after that event.
---
Six: make the grenade launcher a purple item - it far outdoes everything that’s part of the blue loot pool, and outdamages half the shit in the purple pool too. Ammo for it also needs to be rarer - when someone has that gun and 150 more 40mm grenade rounds ready to fire, you’re not surviving unless you can empty a magazine into them before they one or two tap you.
---
Compare them to deathclaws in fo3 or Vegas for example, ghouls can swarm you and give some trouble to bloodied builds, cuz every attack gives you rads
---
You absolutely can. 
---
Take over all three power plants and go to town.
---
You realize one adds more damage the other adds nothing at all for the melee weapon. That’s why one is viable and the other is not. Just because you are sneak and do damage doesn’t make stalkers better. It adds no damage to being sneaky when the other adds WAY more damage thus making better. That’s what you seem to be looking over
---
Thanks
---
Anything related to changing the grind. I’m totally in favor of it being loosened but I don’t think Bethesda has ever even addressed the major grind issues people have so like why even bother asking.
---
It’s made by people who primarily make mobile games. That doesn’t make 76 a mobile game. I can’t download it on my mobile and play it.
---
Yes you can take the power plant workshop and just make fus6cores and all the cores in generators will be their since you're in a private world.
---
Jokes on you I survive solely on dog food
---
You da real MVP
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) sep 22nd\*
---
Well duh lol I didn’t mean it was a mobile game literally but it is clearly designed like one.
---
Wrong, fortnite is still the highest grossing game at over 2 billion currently
---
I wouldn't say nobody heals anyone. Everyone gets 1 from me.
---
You mentioned you do go down frequently for this event, so you may be upset at me when I refuse to pick you up again after your first down. 
---
This could be a factor in what you notice in your game play, if other players at all feel the same way I do.
---
I have yet to be revived lol
---
Yea
---
I wish they just stuck with Fallout Shelter and Maryland made 76.
---
why it wasn't made that way in the first place is because it was basically copied wholesale from fallout 4. that's the answer to probably 80% or more of why things be stupid in this game. EDIT another 15% is probably because they have to make it work on outdated consoles
---
They suck too. 
---
I want the fallout ip to given to a dev team with better resources. Imagine fallout with a competent and modern engine...
---
Nerd
---
Ignore the snap and turn each fence 180, you can then place it anywhere at any angle. Have to place it manually but will allow a circle effect this way!
---
I mean... we eat the glowing meat that drops from glowing enemies. Glowing radrats, glowing radstag, glowing ghouls...
---
I am having the same problem.
---
Idk Pa is weird. I feel like it has vents or something right? Maybe air conditioning...
---
You know, I wouldn’t want anybody else writing the story and making the lore, and there’s nothing quite like Fallout. But if Bethesda and another company made it together then Bethesda would be responsible for the design, storyline and the lore, but the other company should be the ones making it come to life.
---
Or just use a pipe gun in the existing events
---
Honestly - the best damage, ROF, ammo crafting and repair material weapon is the Final Word .50 cal. You can always find Lead, Steel and  Gunpowder and make  180 rounds per build. Prime requires more specialized materials that don’t return as good an investment relative to their damage
---
Thirding. Also extremely important to note that head shots will completely disable the Assaultron's laser attack. Between my shotgun perks and my electrified gauntlet I have gone from absolutely loathing the enemy to gleefully going ham on them on sight.
---
Thing is Bethesda apparently doesn’t use dedicated writers. The programmers write the story or so I’ve read.
---
If we're wishing for more sort options, would also love to see a "Total Weight" sort, which would calculate (weight of item) \* (number of items) so if you accidentally pick up 50 Purified Water, it wouldn't be listed as weighing less than a single melon
---
The biggest challenge for Bethesda is to make sure Earle doesn’t go underground or above ceiling. After that’s taken care of we can talk other creatures.
---
I mean...use a mic.
---
It's 2021.
---
We all have mic.
---
The other, other white meat. Long pig.
---
Or fight other equally equipped players.
---
No way. They don’t make this shit up as they go along, I don’t see that somehow.
---
Yep just bump the price to 1.1 caps. Problem solved. 😆
---
Thats just pvp lol
---
I've never seen that... hmmm
---
They should stop pvp in open free roam, its pointless and the only pvp that exists is workshop griefing.
---
Yea lol
---
I do alcohol, mentats, med-x, psycho, and day tripper. Once you've got your five addictions you can't really use any other chems or you risk getting an additional addiction that it's a pain in the ass to get rid of. So pick any chems you plan on using - my junkies two hander/commando crafts a lot of whiskey and psychobuff, so I can offset the strength penalties when needed. Grape mentats help with bartering. The med-x and day tripper penalties are pretty light.
---
I always feel compelled to fix that poor lady’s robot in the random encounter.  There is 0 benefit, but I do it anyways.
---
I don’t like the writing most of the time. Hell literally every guild quest in Skyrim was subpar to oblivion except MAYBE mages. All their main stories sucked except maybe 3(big maybe) the best they do for me was the lore books in oblivion
---
I go down 4 ish times but I will likely deal the most damage out of most people so I don't see the point in letting the guy with the bloodied 10%aim gataling laser maxed perks for my build (I can go more into that later)sit in a screen for a minute just use a stim in me,  hell ill even give em back lord knows i have loads
---
Yep my rule is if there’s more than two minutes left I won’t attempt to magic it.
---
Yeeeaaahhhh
---
I’m not a fan of Skyrim. Fallout is where it’s at for me.
---
I throw them at trap camps. If I waste my caps travelling to a camp and they imaginatively drop punji boards on me that  steak bomb is getting tossed your way. 
---
If it's at least creative I move on.
---
But that's the only time I ever do anything like that.
---
Hehe I meant for other items like higher end weapons 😁
---
well they shoehorned an old singleplayer 'fps' garbage collecting rpg into a game that suddenly has to be able to accomodate coordinating 20 some odd clients all across the earth on 1000 ping connections and who knows what hardware including two different five year old (at the the time! now it's seven years old) consoles. and they did it with like the third string studio. It's kind of a miracle it works as well as it does and is as succesful as it is
---
A long time ago they dont make them anymore
---
Haha that’s neat. I’ll go one more time for the colossus.
---
What about a legendary machete with a sacrificial blade mod
---
An event with super mutant behemoths at radiation rumble spawn rates would be insanely awesome.
---
A human being would probably give you a better run for your money... Just sayin.... You want the blood pumping start challenging folks!
---
The fo76 community: "Everything in this game is too easy! We want more difficult content!"
---
Also the fo76 community: "Assaultrons and Gutsys are OP!"
---
I already do that some times and an event like that already exists. Its called the "hunters vs hunted" radio
---
Awesome.  I meant awesome.
---
Oh ok. Yea lol I agree
---
He then proceeded to die in one shot.
---
Ad Victorium, motherfucker.
---
Today I started my alt and was sad that I didn't have the ability to fast travel to events in time for ACP because mmm the satisfaction of walking into it at level 4 would've been so delicious.
---
I just did my second ACP event and somehow ended up off by myself in a corner completely surrounded by a huge horde of wendigos the entire time. I'm not sure how I was drawing aggro (maybe because most of the other people were stealth builds), but it definitely felt like keeping the horde away from the bloodied folks was helping. It'd be nice to be able to do it intentionally. I'd go for a perk or legendary armor effect that did it.
---
I hate it when the game crashes during an event. All the effort, gone. That’s what makes me sad.
---
I personally Prime my handmade(5.56)  &amp; leave my fixer unprimed, I find that .45 is easy to find/buy but more expensive to craft than  5.56 &amp; if  you're not using normal 5.56 you can vend it &amp; it will always be one of the first things to sell. 
---
Also, if you unlock Super Duper &amp; Ammo Smith while crafting you'll make a ton of ammo
---
No ooooo God no it's horrible in mine and there is no high pressure water to clean it and it gets stuck in every little crack bolt hole joint it just smells like death all day long.  And that is why I run a bloody build just hoping I get taken out of my shit filled miserable life
---
The simple reason is I also have a character that doesn't wear PA, but I have the decently to run at 50% hp, so I'm not constantly asking my team for help. 
---
As a result, apart from my first run I've never been downed more than once. 
---
I can also solo Earle just fine. In my case, the downed player is the one who needs my help. Like I say, everyone gets one helping hand :)
---
Edit: And I'll just say that it's silly to suggest that you will need this assistance 4x in any given fight, and that other players should feel it's their responsibility to be healers. That's too many. Sorry. Get lifesaving gear. Or be a dedicated healer yourself.
---
I'm an ammo trader so I make it then sell to the masses
---
I’ve encountered it twice, first time I lured him back to floor height and killed him there. Tonight when he had less than 1% hp left he suddenly went into ceiling and won’t move any more. Too funny for endgame boss to do stuff like this.
---
How come you have to eat and drink or there's a penalty but if you don't sleep nothing bad happens?
---
Yeh I’ve had multiple failed events as people give up or just target the wendigos and then dip. Nobody was reviving anyone, someone took my junk when I died too
---
Lol, that's bestheda 4 you
---
No I planted at least 20 cores they never produced shit sorry
---
it doesn't matter if it's the same staff, the way they did it in the past should be noticed or somewhere in the logfiles.
---
also there are several ways for dirty workarounds we see at many other "bugfixes" for this game. they could cap the maximum damage each bullet deals like they did with pvp, remove the Multiplikator that cause the bug or simply make the modifiers work as intended (the last one is utopian, i know).
---
I've always seen it as target practice, but with us as the victims. These kids aren't shit without their OP Weapons/Builds. That's all they do, hide behind their guns and call you trash because you can't defend yourself against OP. 
---
OG PvP was fight club, bare fist. No holds bard, no stopping until someone dies.
---
Funny story, when I made this [hunger/thirst/sleep mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11418) for Fallout 3 I was initially trying to use absolutely realistic numbers for everything. The problem I ran into was that a human being that spends 22 hours a day running with a heavy pack goes through about 12,000 calories a day. I had to dial the numbers back significantly and tell people to play at a reduced timescale.
---
Keep them and always check around that area most of us dump extra stuff around there for new players
---
We need emo/scene hairrr
---
Judging by what we can *barely* see just west of the Ash Heap, it appears that at least the backwoods of Kentucky remain untouched.  Whether the rest of Kentucky survived isn't guaranteed, but there's hints that it's at least partially habited.  For example, Blue Ridge Caravan has had companies in Kentucky hire them to transport supplies, suggesting at least one large trading hub.
---
I honestly would love to see Kentucky since I grew up there.  I remember roads built on the side of steep hills, old houses claimed by nature, abandoned whisky factories, and muddy creeks filled with crawdads and snakes (miredaddies anyone?).  It's a land of mystery and adventure even without the fallout, and that's just the hills.  The western flatlands of Kentucky are something completely different.
---
no problem!
---
So far all the heavies I have tested on the pts are no longer working
---
There was a weekly but people complained and it was taken from score
---
Laser.
---
That should debuff stealth honestly.
---
Is there any legendary perks that do more damage to Wendigos?
---
Been advocating for this as well! I love so many aspects about the game but dressing my character up is one of my favorite things to do. She needs new hairstyles sooooo badly. I know that long hair is a bit of a stretch with clipping but a messy bun or long hair pulled up with loose strands would be cool. Or even some more classic 50s glam styles.
---
Ok I will
---
Add you
---
Fire rate over 200 damage over 100
---
I know you can still do it with junkie mini
---
I have a second char. Lvl 100 sneak build and clear all wendigo's and every critical hit i do on de colossus head. Also a flying medic to revive everyone
---
Sounds like a whole lotta lag
---
And yet my power armor won’t stop the disease from reaching me.
---
If only a legendary perk gave us that option... sigh.
---
*Laughs in vaccinated*
---
Personally I never bothered with it and my results have been fine
---
I have a few vanilla tenderizers, if you're on xbox.
---
I’m just in the back wiping up the spawns.  Once I’ve done my dark deed I drop the pain on Earle.
---
I am on Xbox. PM please
---
Yes it does. Multiple projectiles triggers it.
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I doubt we’ll ever see that one since it’s a Big MT exclusive.
---
Thank you!
---
Then why are my double barrel and pump magical?
---
🤣😂🤣 um.... no. That's not true at all.
---
To the end of what?
---
I’d like to see the ballistic fist return with some different ammo options as mods. Preferably with plasma included, so plasma could be available for almost every weapon type (excluding one hand, and shotguns until they hopefully make the splitter mod turn plasma rifles into shotguns. Two handed is coming with the ops.).
---
Ah yes cloths glass and leather are the best materials to have &gt;_&gt;
---
I just drop about 100 stimpaks while fighting as ive got over 3k never have enough
---
Open world PvP in a low communication MMO is utter garbage. It's never a fair fight its only high levels picking on low levels as they try and claim a workshop. Thats all that exists in FO76 adventure mode pvp.
---
Its bad design.
---
Disconnecting on a Private server that you PAID a membership for is ridiculous. But it’s Fallout 76 so what do you even expect anymore.
---
This guy doesn’t seem to understand that melee never goes above 95% and the only other option is 0%.  Stalkers literally does not effect a melee weapon like you have said.  His melee build comments are straw man beyond belief.  There is no 100% in melee, other guy.  A one star stalkers melee is a vanilla melee weapon.
---
Sure... if they make double exp the base amount of earned exp. The experience needed to level right now is obnoxiously slow.
---
Where you in sneak when using your Stalkers and the Gauss?
---
That’s the most common way to obtain it. The thing melts everything in that game mode, and shoots almost invisible plasma projectiles for some reason. If they made that the default, I’d be fine with it as long as it used the actual green lasers.
---
I was doing the same quest in my own instance on his server. Both of us lost connection in the atrium.  I mean come on..
---
I carry loads of stims just to help my friends and anyone else who needs saving. Im not bloodied myself so its good that we have a guy who is tanky in our group. I run a power armor/ commando build.
---
It sucks to lose progress on a mission, but I’m not sure why needed to use repair kits? Why is your stuff breaking in the middle of a mission? You can repair it at your camp, there’s perk cards that give extra durability. My armor takes forever to break cause of the one that gives 200% repair. My two shot hunting rifle breaks pretty quickly so I use a Fixer for smaller enemies and that lasts for ages.
---
I see that you enjoy playing fo76, but, if you get a chance, there's another settlement that needs your help.
---
No. I am a daily player who does grind ACP and SBQ religiously and I don't think it is worth it. I need the flux for my serums to make caps. The flux has a way better ROI in serums sold to station vendors.
---
Not for the bullion weapons, at least. To my knowledge, it doesn’t add any damage beyond the hardened receiver.
---
That's my real frustration, I'm paying to use this server to avoid exactly this. But also the fact that the game offers no fix or solution is beyond frustrating.
---
Dude doesn't have a clue. Lol. Or got confused with Heavies.
---
Only thing I can think of is coming out of sneak after using the Gauss.
---
I was in there a while man. I was having a rough time. I got some repair kits from the Legendary Run and saved them for a mission like this.
---
Probably because you're comparing it in stealth. The Gauss shotgun is pretty weird sometimes though. I got it the other day and absolutely loved it, one shotted generally everything, until a regular normal ass level 50 scorchbeast dropped... barely tickled it. Seems to have some weird damage numbers sometimes to me and I've read on here about it being bugged, who knows.
---
And this is why I equip Bear Arms and carry all my best weapons on me at all times.
---
Exactly.  People throw around misinformation after watching 4 minutes of two of turtle’s videos.  I’m closing in on my settler max tank after recently finishing raiders.  Getting excited for my new toys.  Gauss minigun is my baby, so I have 2mm up to my gills.
---
Same with money trees, maybe the old paper ones work and that's why they changed 🤔
---
Never has been.
---
Sounds like a whole lotta fun!
---
Just put on the hooded rags outfit. It instantly unequips all armor, under-armor, headgear (helmets/masks/glasses) and outfits.  I always carry one for just this purpose.
---
Yes it doesn’t save THAT much time but it does make the process more convenient. And now that I think about it, it may not remove underarmor. Can’t remember.
---
Re-naming your main armor set and starting each with a space, symbol, or the letter “A” will force them to the top when set to standard sort (alphabetical) to make putting them back on easier as well.
---
Hairstyles and tattoos, it's so damn limited currently..
---
Bruh, I have maybe 3-4 missions for The Crater and I'll get my plan. I can't wait. Being able to switch between builds is gonna be awesome. Have a semi hybrid shotty build that is a lot of fun.
---
Dam it I just put some in the ground yesterday
---
Ha I'm always so quick to revive people because I know how bad it is dying and waiting to spawn in.
---
Appreciate it but I’m on PS4
---
Either way, it's all fixed in PTS, so enjoy it while it lasts :-)
---
I knew people that did this, not to farm it lol but for other legally questionable reasons, they forgot where it was because certain habits affect memory retention lmao
---
Honestly, they should either buff prime ammo or remove the flux cost. Right now it’s just not worth it, but if I just needed ultracite or it was substantially more powerful, I’d be all over it.
---
My junkies mini does 6 damage to earle before adrenaline.
---
Also equip Demolition Expert. That'll help bump the damage a bit.
---
Been there done that sadly
---
Me too.   I really wish this event weren't tied to nuke dropping.
---
thats how the game is lolololololol
---
How many were actually trying to hurt Earl?   Anyone besides yourself?
---
Area chat wouldn't work?
---
Dysentery should include  a -15 Charisma debuff.
---
Should be fine as long as you follow some graphics tweak guides to reduce the graphical load.  I run it on a 1070 and generally stay above 60fps, though granted I have grass turned off, godrays turned off, and shadow/item/NPC distance down low.
---
If only Bethesda was capable of that. How much they paying you?
---
Hey man we all gotta get by somehow, I'm one of them people referenced when Julie prefaces "When I get low, I get high" that do take it literally.
---
You could have fast traveled again to the same place, that's just you being an asshole.
---
And the bench one, you could have just gone elsewhere.
---
So, in conclusion, you're just an asshole who feels entitled.
---
I was doing SBQ with one other person (and a lvl 12) until about 15 minutes in and 6 others showed up nearly at once. Now I know why.
---
You can just re-fast travel back to the camp and it gives you another spawn.
---
Ok this thread took one hell of a left turn lmfao 7 degrees of wtf
---
A Gargantuan Tick would be a challenge.
---
workshops are pvp zones period.  pacifist won't help you.  the fact you owned the workshop is why you were vulnerable to pvp.  this was 100% on you and you reported someone who did exactly nothing wrong so Bethesda will just ignore your complaint as they should.
---
In the future don't hang out in workshops for any length of time unless you are 100% ok with pvp. 
---
Train stations, no, but again as you left out the information that you were in a workshop in your op you are probably leaving something out of the story about whatever lead you to get killed at a train station.
---
☝️⭐ TRUEST STATEMENT ⭐☝️
---
A guy I work with runs for a hobby and regularly does marathons.  The amount of food he can eat and still look like a stick figure is unreal.  He must eat 1500 calories just for lunch every day, and he’s no stranger to a case of beer.
---
Maybe 1% of the playerbase is interested in PVP it doesn’t work, 76 is to clunky. Maybe you need to find another survival game that appeals to your play style.
---
I haven’t heard of that changing.
---
I know right? Very first ACP I did was just me and my level 39 brother because nobody else showed up. He was excellent at drawing Earl’s attention and healing me when I was downed. Same with a level 20 buddy of mine that accompanied me to ACP another time. And today I joined a team as my level 15 character and helped them with 3 ACP fights. I couldn’t really lay down the hurt but I drew everything’s attention with fire bows and Molotovs and revived people when downed. (My level 300 teammates were understanding thankfully, really nice too. They used a few lunch boxes for me. I was level 20 by the time we were done.)
---
Maybe so. I had to give up a nice Junkie’s 50 cal because of the stealth aspect. I’m not a shotgun build either. I’m stealth commando. My Stalker’s fits better with my build, I guess. Really wanted a new, cool looking toy though.
---
Yeah it's not suited for your build I don't think. It's more of a loud and in your face monster! It's a great gun, I just wish I could get my head around the damage it does sometimes. Magic shotgun that is suppressed would be alot better for your build even if you're not specced for it, which you already have.
---
Probably goes with the crap attitude of one-shotting legendaries.
---
https://imgur.com/ztfmD9n.jpg That's better than anything I've seen before.
---
200% preferred it to be an outfit instead of an underarmor. It looks much nicer then the steel dawn one we just got and I actually enjoyed the change.
---
Informative posts about the Tesla being the cause of FPS drops are useful. I would not have associated the Rifle to be the issue if it wasn't for these posts. I love using it to mass kill Wendigo's or mass tag in LiTS, but I've easily given that up to enhance both mine and other players experience. Of course it would be good for Bethesda to fix it, but until that, we can temporarily solve it by avoiding usage
---
Ummm military fatigues have been around since Beta....
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Military_fatigues_(Fallout_76)
---
Also now that they apparently fixed (ruined!) Brotherhood Fatigues, that’s another option assuming you don’t mind gray/blue camo
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_fatigues_(Fallout_76)
---
The Camo Ops underarmor is another atom shop option, granted it’s more of a tan/desert camp and hasn’t been available for a while but you never know when they’ll add it again and it’s moddable
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Camo_ops_outfit
---
Luckily no, But I do hunt for low levels and drop all my unwanted plans on them on my Lvl 200 character.  
---
I've just started a new pistol build and I'm low on everything. However, it's all about gathering supplies and gathering weapons/armor for plans to make better weapons and armor.  I musty admit it's a lot easier with a FO1st sub as I can level up by taking workshops and not having to worry about contesting them so I only jump on to public servers looking for cheap (5cap) plans from vendors.
---
Um I think you mean +15
---
No!, its WAZER WIFLE okay?
---
I’m pretty much always shitting myself and covered in parasites, welcome to the wasteland! 🤙
---
If you think that's bad play wasteland 3 it crashes quite often
---
I prime certain weapons, but not others.  The first thing I’d do with an LMG or gauss mini is prime it, because large quantities of ammo are easier to produce if you spend time gathering and stabilizing flux.  The legendary ammosmith perk will make it even easier.
---
Sniper rifles are also nice with primed receivers.  The rifle is efficient, assuming you have a good build and a nice legendary version, so 1000 rounds goes a long way.
---
For a Fixer, 50cal or Gatling gun, I don’t.  Standard ammo is easy enough to acquire, and I’d rather supplement with the ammo I get from the ammo press, converter, boxes and corpses.  Daily Ops may change that, but I’m not sure.  As of right now, the bonus damage to Scorched isn’t all that significant.  Scorchbeasts are much tougher on the PTS, but I’m not fighting them around every turn.

When I was a junkie, I didn't actively use chems, so i got the addictions with the least amount of drawbacks(IMO of course)

I was able to offset these penalties by using the herbivore mutation,  herd mentality  and strange in numbers if you play on a public server.  herd mentality still works in private servers as well if you create a public team.

Why would you want a bright lamp for Power Armor.
---
The second you get close to anything (looting distance) it becomes blinding and washes everything out anyway, why would you want brighter?
---
ammo machine
---
I like to imagine that in long term use power armour suits there would be catheters and suction to remove waste.
---
mate  You cant scrap fixers, if you are looking learn mod, you need scrap combat rifles, using the same mods table
---
It’s good for getting scorched beasts to land if you’re a melee build, I use them all the time on my melee character.
---
(They occasionally work on the SBQ too.)
---
Killing wendingo in mass is one of the few things in-game I truly enjoy more than sex, drugs, and copious amounts of food. Kamikaze with Nuke mines! Auto Grenade launcher! Come get some! Why don't you try a taste of my nuka grenades!
---
very valid question 🤔
---
Maybe it's like the "burger" Stallone are when he visited the underground place in Demolition Man.
---
Ain't super mutant immune to diseases?
---
There is a few places to jump up to, like barrels, where wendigos mostly wont reach
---
You know what's more annoying then crashing out in the middle of a fight? Rubber banding health enemies - bulletsponge supermutants with 9000 ping, that's a challenge buddy. I cleared out West Tek a couple of times like this - power armour grinded to dust, went through several *** weapons. Beth knows how to make a souls like game 😂
---
Maybe the gauss will get a suppressor one day. I’ll be in business then.
---
I’m imagining this player spawned into a SBQ event and decided minimum was the way to go from now on. Good effort lol
---
You should play FO NW
---
Damn if these power armor skins were rewards in NW I might actually put fourth time and effort into this POS game mode... I love that blue one.
---
The problem is NW failed I’ve only played it when it has events to unlocks items for adventure and I’m level 30. The game is to clunky and PVP in general in this game failed (majority of people don’t play 76 for the PVP inc adventure PVP)
---
They need to find another source for these rewards but they need to make sure that people who earned them through NW didn’t waste their time (at least not completely)
---
This was my impression, that the FEV protected them from virtually anything, which should include anything infected with FEV like Mutant Hounds...
---
I'll two shot those guys for ya so we can get it done faster... just let me shot him a couple times first
---
That almost looks like a Kevduit thumbnail.
---
LOL!!!  I snort-laughed!!  I don't GAF about the downvoting ladies, that shit is funny!
---
I know it’s worth it for the bows. My Bow was the first weapon I ever primed cause the arrows I get from crafting went from like 20 to 70 every time.
---
In the words of Metallica. “Sad but true”
---
I have framedrops as well, but nothing near to going from 60 to 20. Worst case scenario i can drop 1, max 4 fps in particular zones.
---
But beside that, my experience is pretty smooth.
---
Yeah i may have an overkill rig to play it, but still, it happened the same with my old PC (which was high end as well). FO4 runs miles better because its a single player game.
---
   
---
Does your character have time? I had the same bug in all my characters, the effect of food only gave me 10%, I had to remove the mutations and put them back on, and all ok.  I remember a year and a half ago that adrenaline reaction stopped working, the solution was also to erase the mutations and put them on again.
---
Eh?? I transferred some ammo and a new bow I crafted to a second character just fine today...
---
(Glad I didn’t decide to transfer them a couple rare outfits too if it’s being buggy...)
---
I swear I've gotten a few recently. Regardless I have a furious SS, an AA and maybe a couple more (I get legendaries faster than I can scrip them) and haven't had them that long. 
---
Cultist... Umm not the machete looking one, I'm not online right now but will be shortly.
---
i do that to flex my Instigating/33/25 Double Barrel and to get screws and also get rid of my stimpaks since they always weigh me down
---
Holy crap... Did it do the screams and sounds a normal scorched does but in the robobrain voice? I’m very curious.
---
There's an exploit to get back in the front door, look it up
---
Only buffing modifiers to outgoing damage have been changed. Everything else works pretty much like before. This includes things like the energy damage reduction from the Grounded Mutation (which is still 50% of all damage) and the way armor reduction stack.
---
They're in the game files. The face texture was never completed, so they probably just never got around to implementing it, rather than for a story reason.
---
You can see a Scorched Behemoth in all its glory
---
"I saw your CAMP today. Great start! Now that you've gathered all that junk into random clumps of structure, when does the real construction begin?"

As someone who finds their CAMP as their endgame, I only cried for about an hour.

You really dont have to there is an entire subreddit of art devoted to deathclaw human breeding.

Lmao, you sir are the first person to genuinely make me laugh for a solid minute in a year or so take my upvote

10 in all SPECIALs is super weak in 76 my guy.

This would make more sense for Grahm to wear, sorry

Why is it so hard to just have clean stuff?

True. I had one in my machine for 2k and it only lasted a few days. Mine came from a gift bag of spoiled stuff and the note 😂🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Anti armor will still multiply same as always
---
With tank killer 3, anti armor and penetrating mag :

DRf = DRi × 0.64 × 0.50 × 0.60
---
Milk a brahim. I like to see if its a nice boy and give me milk and how much or just kick me
---
12.7mm is .50
---
I almost cried when the clean lab coat came out.
---
Yeah dude.  I'm an entitled asshole like as if. You're calling people derogatory terms on the internet. Who gave you the right?  Suck my dick.
---
Yup you can take workshops in your own private world and just farm with no worries of getting attacked by Dickcheese Mcgee looking to pad his K/D by killing low levels in workshops with his explosive energy weapon.
---
(Just make sure you have your world set to closed in case you don’t trust any of your buddies to join and capture your workshop while you’re AFK.)
---
Even if you weren't running around jumping and just sitting at your camp... You'd still have to chug 4+ litres of water......
---
I work 12 hour shifts in a warehouse.... I can't even do that lol.
---
Pretty sure a can of dog food would full anyone first try.... It is 500 grams of food...
---
Yeah, my thing is that people shouldn’t be *forced* to play it... But people who do should be rewarded beyond the one daily objective.
---
Once they fix energy armor penetration, hopefully you kill things fast enough to not burn through condition
---
Genuine lol
---
Honestly they just need to remove this mode and make these rewards unlockable else where. I’ve grinded my way to level 30 and it’s been painful, I spend majority of the time hiding and mostly afking and I still can’t be bothered. I purely play for unlocks for adventure mode.
---
So to respond to you no thanks to more ranks.
---
Imagine playing as the fascist in 2020
---
The hate-bandwagon at launch (and after) is one of the most undeserved bad reputations forced by a community I have ever seen. At the time, there was a huge trend among gamers to attempt to topple over AAA-gaming behemoths like Bethesda, Blizzard and EA.
---
It was probably hugely inspired by the attacks on EA for adding obscene microtransactions to Star Wars Battlefront, which shook the company to the degree that Disney almost pulled their rights to the Star Wars franchise. When people go together to make a change, and it actually works, is a huge step and feeling of being *us vs. them,* which is a sorely needed feeling these days.  
---
Anyways, I'm real glad you're having fun! Keep at it, Wastelander
---
I love you
---
Yeah, it's not this one, right? This is still in the game, as a very rare drop from Savage Divide events.  
---
[Forest Scout Armor Mask](https://i.redd.it/y2o9a6typic41.jpg)
---
That won't do it. Drop all those dumbass notes and holotapes, I know you have them
---
It just works
---
Very rare that you get a server where people pay attention and listen to the higher levels tho unfortunately, always stand in a clear area nice and spread out where she can aggro someone, don't shoot her in the air, that simple, but even when you're doing it no one's paying attention there is always one dude with a gallon plasma that won't stop shooting her in the air and makes the event last so much longer and expend way more ammo🤦‍♂️
---
All of the killable faction npcs will work this way. Free xp and stims.
---
If you get XP for killing them, it is a good thing to do.
---
Would you please share where the Scorched [Krotchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYaEqIQQmLA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=628) can be found?
---
Follow me!
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Yeah, thats fair. I mean i pvp in both when i can.  One takes anywhere from 5 - 30mins for a game and the other is even harder to get someone to have a pvp with you you'll be waiting longer for that. Lol. But i know what you mean about the lag. I curse when im in a battle in nw and it so clunky, that when my screen starts moving again, I'm on the ground needing to be revived. That does my head in.
---
Playing on a low lvl char atm, and my job is run around and reviving people. If possible, kiting spawns around
---
I still see +300s plop down their tents &amp; camp on top of them. Yesterday, I was in a SBQ fight for 15 minutes FULL of people because half of them were blasting away from their tents &amp; ended up just tabbing out until it was over. Donkey Brains at Queen fights appears to affect all levels.
---
Gonna do this now to the guy with the 200 ammo factories lagging the server.
---
Especially if you own the workshop. You think pacifist does A Lot more than it really does. All it does is prevent you from handshaking for pvp in the wild.
---
It does not bend the rules of workshop pvp so you can afk farm junk
---
Nope. Ultracite, t65 and excavator don't have headlamp mods
---
I keep firing as I have tenderiser 3, I swap out one gun army for luck of the draw though
---
Wendigo gang
---
I was on the pts the other day and ran the queen omg it was so nice to be in a group that new wtf they were doing only one guy was blasting away.  I recorded it been meaning to post it
---
Reginald P. Humphries: *Should be all empty now*
---
Ammo machine and farming tiles, I have the herbivore mutation and having a whole nice looking field of foods I need for quests or recipes is a time saver
---
Yeah not that one. It’s called tanned scout mask I believe
---
Exactly. Anyone who puts jetpack plans in their vendors for 1500 caps needs to be punished.
---
I don’t have access to t-65 just yet but yes just like the secret service armor you need to buy the t-65 chest plan and jetpack modification plan separate.
---
Haha Dino go extinct
---
I'd like a normal version of it more tbh Not a fan of the hotrod flames
---
Yep! You need to know the base plan before you can add skins.
---
Haha bag go bye bye
---
Man, was Sandra Bullock looking good in that film.... :-)
---
Dude these are awesome! If I wasn't so sentimental with my builds, I'd definitely do recreations and themed builds on the weekly!

So you cant have two mods on the chasis?

For a mining PA it's ironic that the Excavator has no headlamp mods.

How to get those Brotherhood of Steel role players off the bunker during scorched earth 101
---
If cow kicks, it dies
---
I do it for the screws! And also Wendigos drop stims so it's no probs to revive people.
---
Buy Secret Service Tempered mods. Thank Me later
---
It takes reduce damage to the head dumm dum
---
Ya i guess adding would be wayyy too op, i mean it would be 100% reduction pretty quick if it was the same as damage output
---
I always felt like people got annoyed if I just took on the wendigos. I dont have a very powerful weapon so I'd always  just tag Earle and spend the rest of my time fighting the little shits
---
All my homies hate troubleshooter armor
---
When u say everything else “pretty much” do u mean there is something else that has changed besides dmg output
---
He's a raider
---
You should try shooting it until it dies
---
Ah I see, cool. Thanks for info
---
Nah i figured i was just pulling at a male cow if that happens and let him be.
---
You could always team up with someone and raid it again
---
I farm the ultracite ammo in the Daily Ops. It's better than crafting ammo like a simp

I usually just make a point to not buy anything at their camp...

Or, at the very worst, leave a bag of fertilizer and TP on their front steps...
---
Shhhh
---
I don't mind the tents of they're spread out, if anything the ones on them should kill adds, but I just stay hidden with my fixer so they don't bother me, but yeah it's frustrating, and then you get people even at the new even that are clueless lol
---
They're not lying, and yes it is eyebleach-inducing.
---

No, loot 180 other items and they will respawn on server hop

Go read the wiki page. You need to finish a free states quest in other to start it.

I don't know why everyone is calling it a legacy because I keep getting so damn many of them that I script each one if its 3*

I would pay money for a three perk slot stash. Even if it only gave 50% of the bonus.
---
US citizen vibes

Shhh keep it down man Todd is gonna hear you and im gonna get in troub-
---
Spend 2 minutes equipping a load of perks whenever I return to my camp because it took them over 2 years to implement a perk loadout system.
---
Beth's code must be checking the areas for rad zone instead of where the nuke is heading. They trigger events on all the rad zones, resulting in this bug.
---
Nuke monogah mine first, then 2 SBQs and you can do ACP 3 times

Rule  8. Something similar already happened with Assaultron heads and was patched out.  Neither were intended, both are considered exploits.

Nsfw. People do post the occasional rape of a vault dweller on there so may not want to go there. I was subscribed for a time as a joke with my cousin and kept forgetting to unsubscribe.
---
I'm level 410 (Bloodied, Stealth, Commando/Heavy gunner Build, never use power armor), my 1st 2 attempts at this event I died so much my wait time got up to 60 seconds to eventually I got kicked outside. Twice after that I made it to the end but because I was standing at the entrance I died just as Earle gets kilked because of rocks falling down. Although I'm a high level player, I didn't know what the hell I was doing because all the crap falling from the ceiling.
---
If I had not seen the YouTube video about the asbestos chest lining preventing you from taking damage from the falling ambers, I would have given up on that event. Now imma do that event as much as possible. I can care less who I do that event with, I'm on a public server. If I don't want to play with anyone else, I go to my private server. What I have noticed is most players focus on Earle. As long as I do enough damage to be able to loot Earle is good enough for me, I get my shoots on him and then take out the smaller wendigos and if I'm able to get to you in time when you need reviving, I got you.
---
You would never find a good legendary on the market if it weren't for duping

Daily quests were good, but now they're poofed and I'm done with the SCOREboard, so …

I like to [yeet this skeleton](https://gfycat.com/compassionateflusteredangora) that occasionally spawns at my camp.

Omg thanks this is gunna be fun

Pay your taxes

Same but Whitesprings

They had all the time to implement quality of life changes. But nope. They make more skins instead
---
N op e
---
WHAT!? THESE WERE GONNA BE A THING?!
---
"Eat shit, food build!"
---
HA..HA..HA..bzzzt..REKT!
---
I mean zero Charisma
---
Yes, we can still beat the boss but we dont want you freeloading and extending the event. Someone else with end game build would be more useful.
---
BOS outfits are what you want to wear to stand in solidarity with Kyle Rittenhouse
---
Surely if its 90% reduced weight a mini nuke would go from being 6 to 0.6
---
Yeah its not that active maybe once every two weeks someone posts so it was like four chan bombing myself
---
When the Scorchbeast doesn't immediately appear what has happened is it has spawned nearby on the ground and bugged out.  In the mire if you're doing the event east of Harpers Ferry then it spawns to the south down the cliff and on the other side of the mire it spawns in the trees to the west.  If you run up and shoot at it just enough to get it's attention it will eventually unbug and teleport closer to the event and trigger the next phase.
---
Yeah, can we get some more, pretty please? The beehive looks stupid as all hell and the ones we have are just the fallout 4 styles. More character creation would be lovely as opposed to content like whoever the fuck Grelok is.
---
Yup! They're going to add an extra 40 seconds to your load times and crash you out of the server!
---
Psa: I dont say anything to low levels but wish there were high levels instead.
---
I do that too! Mine is always open. Flyers for all!
---
I assure you that there are others and that you are not alone.
---
Ranger Outfit = Kenosha Kyle
---
Me, a bloodied melee, getting rid of the spawns because always being near Earl is kinda dangerous.
---
I don't mind playing with low levels at all. It's sometimes the highlight of the event watching them blunder around. We had a level 15 show up at radiation rumble and when he left he was over level 20.
---
Yeah, it was custom built for him when he became a super mutant which was 130-odd years after Fallout 76, so how would it fit a human here?
---
That’s what I was doing last time!
---
Nah I think that guys just on potent chems.
---
Udderly low perception
---
Op is having big brain time
---
Oh look another one of you who takes video games way to seriously, read that back to yourself and try to remember your early levels when you would've done the exact same thing.
---
I didnt go to end game events in my early levels...
---
I thought it was baby Deathclaw. Why else would the damned things be so pissed off all the time?
---
I just thought it would be cool to have it as a paint job for the power armor.
---
Shades of BioShock Infinite...
---
Blocker is OP as fuck. Any real incoming damage is going to be melee.
---
Same here.
---
I turn off the radios i come across.
---
we need a man bun hair style, as well as being able to change the color of hair, beard and eyebrows separately.. as much as i love have blue eyebrows, i dislike having blue eyebrows
---
Also melee attack with weapons work
---
That's be great! I think that's the trade off for the damage numbers though, would be way too OP if you got stealth bonuses too! My junkies Gauss specced for shotguns with full demo expert is over 1000 damage.
---
Strange doesn't require squadmate to have that mutation.
---
It probably is visual bug where you lost the strange benefit and the effects tab updating to show base value. You'll still be getting the 20%.
---
Ouch, you'r killing my eyes with those you'rs.

I hope the next Fallout is better.

---
No, that's just me trying to avoid absolute statements when I don't know for sure. :-D As in, I am not aware that anything else about the damage calculation was changed apart from the way outgoing damage bonuses stack, and I'm fairly certain that all other factors (armor reduction, all damage reductions, anything applied at the target and not the source, sneak bonuses) still work like before.
---
My collectron would say that it is because your collectron is a filthy capitalist
---
No scorchbeast events or uranium fever around 20-40 bullshit

Damn right. I need something to sell in my vendors and I'm not picking up garbage.

Nah, it's nice to use on someone who looted my bag.

Thanks for the suggestion I finally found a piece of armor that has that effect but it still didnt work, thank you though.

Yes i didnt go to sbq event before 50 you dipshit. Game literally tells you it is a high level event.
---
Make sure you are on a team with heavy damage users then carry around a weapon youwant ammo for. You dont have to fire a shot. I gather all of the wendigos up and walk around with them attacking me. Im a tank so they do little damage to me and i just stab them with a ultracite minigun and pick up all the ammo.
---
it’s year 2102, we all have radiation now
---
Add asbestos lining to you chest piece, you will not take damage from the falling ambers. If you can sneak that will help. Don't stay in one spot, shoot and move (think of it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move).
---
at least in eso there are public dungeons, area bosses et cetera. bethesda really missed the mark where zenimax succeeded
---
Try playing the game and having it happen organically, you afk bush
---
I tried a lot still trying.
---
Hope the drops arnt exactly the same.. atleast change up the flamer and shiskabob plans for something else but.. its bethesda so more then likely be exactly the same
---
I would like it to be more realistic, like literally shitting and vomiting
---
“Sometimes I think about burning this C.A.M.P down”
---
They are mistaken. I have 5 pieces of -20% weight for chems and drinks and it works just fine, capped to -90%. I could unequip Traveling Pharmacy III and Thru Hiker III thanks to that.

Me, a bloodied melee power Armor user, slapping Earl about the head and neck a bit then going on a wendigo rampage until the end. Exp is noiiice.
---
You can indeed! We hate looters, Freuuds and spammers.
---
I'm bloodied so I spend time on the boss an use stimpaks to stay alive then after a used a few I go for the spawns to get more because I prefer not to use too many of my own and like to have spares if I need them and can't get them like generally playing. Any extra meds I can sell. And they're good for xp so going for the spawns in general is a good idea
---
Me, a junkies melee none PA user, doing drugs \*hits physcobuff\* I WILL LIVE FOREVER!!!!!

You trying to tell me I shit myself daily
---
I see! So this was probably what happened to me in the real wasteland in Mexico. We used to wash up in the river.

I want night vision on my T65 from the secret service ffs

I do something kinda similar to camps with Brahmin farms. I use the "come here" emote to the camp owner while im standing next to thier Brahmin. Once they find me I yell in english over my mic, in a German accent, to "Give me the grail Dr.Jones!" "Or your wife will not be seeing the next update" "Give to me NOW!".... Actually got a couple legendaries out of it, more then often It ends with  me poping off one of the Brahmins heads with my revolver.
---
What kind of ammo?
---
Well hello mister fancy pants!
---
Yes, it was Todd.
---
It'd be nice if they didn't genderlock the hairstyles tbh
---
Just another thing to add to the collection of forever broken outfits.
---
No mountain scout mask still
---
Even the new bos outfit meshes horribly if you are wearing operative under armor.

At least they fixed the insurgent hat eventually

Just today I saw a three star mythic deathclaw pet. It took all my will power to just shoot some pictures and not bullets.

Ha ha i dont even know what a wendigo is im level 12, just starting the firebreathers stuff.. cant wait to find out what that is tho, do you need to be level 20 to start to get the stealth suit plan?
---
I wish I knew where these spawns were
---
Dont think the way armor pen and % damage reductions have been changed aince they multiply to give deminishing returns. However the performance between AA and junkies is within 5% or so on the PTS.

Does tem medic 3 work for all nearby players, or just those in your public team?

I'm wondering if all players in a public event also are classed as team members while the event is running.

I've been trying out stim diffusers but don't know if I'm wasting my time.

Im not sure why screws are so important, should i be picking up all junk? Im level 12 but im often over encumbered and not sure what to drop?

This would be hilarious, guaranteed.

Only thing I could think of seeing this picture was [This Song.](https://youtu.be/XUhVCoTsBaM)

is that why shotguns break so fast, because all the pellets count as dmg to the gun?

Nicely done. Thats really cool
---
Says you. It doesn’t look like it so I must have stopped offscreen and popped a squat. Plus, my power armor must have a waste recycler in it.
---
I am not sure. I think it's only those on your 4 man though. BUT knowing bethesda it probably is everyone there
---
I don't understand why the gold press machines even have an UI. A simpler and faster design would have you [Activate] them and drop all (up to the max) your treasure notes.

Lore is abit of a mess in 76, they (Bethesda) need to focus abit more on lore rather than the AtomShop imo. Then again, people keep on asking for this and that for their camp, can we have this skin... The cosmetic side of things are very far from what we know and love from previous titles, again imo. That said there is a demand for cosmetics so why not supply it. I blame fortnite, and kids.

Escape timer? Simply stay and loot, when the timer runs out, you'll only be teleported out and receive the event reward.
---
I had gotten one of these a few months back and didn't know it was valuable, I dropped it...fuck me.

&gt;e been around from the start.  But unless everyone votes with their wallet, nothing really will encourage Todd to fix things.

That would definitely make sense. You could equip one of the appropriate weight perks to properly roleplay a drug|ammo|items seller.
---
I was never able to switch weapons while in VATS.
---
If you want your site to be taken seriously, you need to overhaul your price checker, it's a joke
---
Its a fucking shotgun
---
The light is great for nuke zones and pitch black areas.
---
An emote for this please bethesda
---
So you are saying we should now mow down your camp?
---
Who are you to judge what others price their shit at?
---
Im currently level 306 and i dont give a fuck about low level player in that event.  
---
If you are at a similar level like me and you cant solo Earle, then please, stop attending that event and make space for some low level players, so they can get the rewards.
---
Anything with screws in keep you can check what the junk item contains by checking them in the menu
---
Even more when fog rolls in
---
Dude, I'm right here, and I'd like to think that I'm a perfectly cooked giant ballsack.
---
I don’t know how anyone could kill you at your camp. Workshops are PvP Zones and pacifist doesn’t matter. They shouldn’t deal any damage at a camp
---
Nice one, I'm wrestling myself with a pool or modern house build, like your ideas 👍
---
Yes you need to learn the plan...
---
they should bring back vaults and make some nice hard arena with tons of enemies.
---
That's a good tip about the hooded rags! I will definitely start doing that. I already rename everything so it's just "A Left Leg" etc. That came in really handy when I was trying to compare equipped vs new armor to see what was better.
---
Stalker does jack shit nothing to melee weapons, but increase the AP cost. Try to grasp it now.
---
I'm not being argumentative, but I feel like I'm ignorant as to why people still use PA instead of the SS armor. My DR is at 460, and I get all the legendary and mod perks as well, without needing costly repairs and fusion cores. What are the perks of PA vs. SS armor? Is it just a preference, or is there a notable bonus?
---
You should create a berserkers character.
---
Glowing Mole miner is my favourite.
---
After 20+ ACP events I must admit its a breeze now, even done it with full JunkE and Bloodied builds. So we have now do an ACP, then 2 Queens. I'm awaiting One Wasteland now and Legendary perks to play with.
---
But dont tell him I have a bloodied fixer
---
That’s if it doesn’t consistently crash and you loose everything
---
You on ps4?
---
Fun Police here: It would probably create new exploits for NW/PVP &amp; possibly add more ways to glitch through walls.
---
Just drop one piece of ammo or something else, that will move the other bag.
---
Yep! But I’ve been just buying them from vendors and scrapping weapons.
---
Was wondering if the luck stat level have anything to do with drops ?
---
drop some more stuff a few meters away but not too far. The stuff from the other bag will go to the new bag.
---
sorry that it is too late...
---
True facts mate
---
The glitch is only for photomode itself to get through  doors. If we don’t even use photomode it shouldnt happen. All it has to be is a se o dart quick wheel we can access with the d pad

There's a few events which have plans unique to them. Things like underarmor linings but it requires you to know the previous lining. Census violence throws out some plans you can't buy.
---
This makes me think of Warhammer games (in a good way).
---
Very Cool

Lmao everyone has the right. And hes doing it be cause you're comment was stupid. If you don't agree then why has it been deleted?

there is more effective and not boring ways to farms these junks. Playing the game and finding them in specific locations.
---
They called it Chorro or running poop.
---
Works also with enclave underarmor. I noticed ss underarmor clips big time though.
---
it's all I can really do as Earle makes my guns look like paintball markers facing down a tsunami
---
I also demand that in a multiplayer game I am protected from anything anyone else does.
---
Thats how i use my stealth build kill the wendigo revive the PA tanks ,dump couple hundred rounds of gatling lazer crouch and repeat
---
This is why you don’t where pants in the wasteland.
---
Thanks for the insight. I wouldnt have expected it to work on scorchbeasts. I never hear of anyone using it in a positive way so its good to know it does have some use in game.
---
only true gamers will understand
---
I turn them all on, and juke boxes.
---
They could just disable the ability to pose when you are flagged for pvp or in a workshop if there was any possiblity it could be used to exploit. As far as NW is concerned, that mode wouldn't need the feature.
---
I'm all for it, I love popping random poses and I think having the ability to use them outside of photomode would make their pricing a bit easier to stomach. As it stands I only buy poses when they are on special. Please Bethesda, this can't be that hard to implement and would be so amazing.
---
Gringo diet is another one :)
---
Guess that's why it has a feedback option.
---
Oh no I ran out of toilet roll not long ago
---
I feel like I only ever get the same three diseases...
---
Mostly radworms...occasionally I've logged out completely clean and later logged back in to an in-progress radworms infection...
---
I've just accepted it at this point, and operate on the assumption that I will always have the little shits when I'm playing.
---
I only prime high damage weapons. Things like the gatling gun, lever action and so forth. IMO high fire rate weapons go through too much ammo, plus for things like the mini ammo is pretty easy to find. In saying that, I do prime my explosive gatling plas and laser as you can produce a lot of cores with ammo smith and super duper.
---
Good thing i live in a swamp then dont have to worry bout cleaning up after people who visit
---
Go to the forest and click kn all the logs. Doeant take long
---
Not if you're not wearing pants.
---
I click everything in my camp that can be prompted.
---
Because he's an asshole who at least realized he was wrong.
---
Do the adds keep spawning if you cripple them but leave them alive? Heard that works for Radiation Rumble. Got enough level ups unused to chuck 3 at enforcer...
---
Which is why you won't get one
---
I’ve lost track of the number of times I’ve killed her in the air.
---
She doesn’t need to be on the ground to die....with the right weapon, it’s not that hard.
---
That's quite an army, of 3 ppl, you got there.
---
Appalachia has had it's fill of the military by the looks of it, and rightly so I think.
---
I managed to get Paradise with five others the other day but that's the first time in months ive seen people actually there, which is a shame because its an alright event
---
I can't give you too much shit about the action, i too have nuked a camp ... of someone who was being an absolute shitlord to me.  
---
But the why .... dear baby jezus, that's like ramming your car into a hotdog stand because you feel he's overcharging, are they holding you at gunpoint ?, are they MAKING you buy one stars at 1400 caps ?  
---
I recently heard of some shithead youtuber popularizing harassment over vendor prices and now i'm torn between you being a closeted sociopath or just easily goated into harassment, but in either case the only message you're sending is that your should get out more :/
---
That's what I try to do there. I have a shotgun build, so hitting Earle is very tedious. I only try to hit him a few times critical and then help the heavy gun players.
---
Yes, and if explosive it’s twice as fast.
---
Should he the full 1st shot.all pellets.its a bit wonky works alot better if you get that shot in with vats just wont see that double damage if enemies are not at 100%health
---
Throw useless floater grenades behind low lvl players in sneak mode
---
I got 9. High luck build
---
Naw they fixed it now
---
Really, that's how you think people use the internet? Go to a new site, use a broken feature and then decide to help that site with feedback rather than just never bother with it again? Yeah good luck with that
---
Vendor hopping. Saw a guy yesterday who had 50k ammo for sale. Need to ask that question to him really.
---
it was a long time but it was definitly fixed with patch 21. i use it again since then and it worked properly til the last time i checked which is some days ago.
---
*salutes* 
---
Grenadier Ashlyn at your service, clearing hordes of Wendigos with explosives since 1992, If you would like to request my services for your boss fights dm me. 
---
OORAH
---
Is it passive?  I never see anything pop up on the screen like nerdrage does
---
I haven't stopped doing it, and I admit to bugging it, the more lvl I get before OW hits, the faster those perks are getting upgraded.
---
As for you doing it solo, you have to decide that for yourself. Can you oneshoot every single mob as fast as they spawn in?
---
It doesn't have that sort of popup. But if you look at the active effects on your pipboy it shows there.
---
Their inability to deal with hackers is the reason they abandoned NW. It's sad because the game mode had a lot of potential. The gun fights are really unique and fun once you learn the meta.
---
Screws and Adhesive are 2 things you should never pass up grabbing. 
---
You will use them every time you repair a weapon or armor. 
---
At level 12, and being un familiar with the game, I'd suggest picking up and scrapping *everything* that isn't bolted down. 
---
By level 20 you'll have a good stockpile of everything and you'll know better what you need (screws, ballistic fiber) and what you don't (glass, ceramic) and can go from there.
---
Another tip would be to go into your pip boy and scroll to junk, then select 'view components' and it'll bring up a list of items. Scroll until you see screws and then select it so that a magnifying glass icon shows up on any item that contains them. This way you'll learn quicker what contains them (desk fans, typewriters, toys) etc.
---
Cool thanks
---
From previous posts, I’ve found that an Instigating shotgun gives all pellets the damage multiplier. It seems that this, as well as the Furious variant count the pull of the trigger as the attack rather than each individual pellet
---
I haven't done it  the last several times because the lag and jerky screens make me feel kinda sick.
---
Must be bad luck then every time I go to dyer I only find pods
---
they already stole a bunch of ideas from NEXUS for 4 so dont see why it'd be a problem for them now
---
dud that was fun last night, thanx.  I got more key cards maybe we can do it again tonight
---
You have to remove what is at the top of the stairs first then you can remove the stairs.
---
Thats what im sayin, out of all the low hanging fruit, this has to be one of the lowest
---
I may not be the person doing the majority of the damage, but even so I don’t find myself using that much ammo in ACP. Maybe a 200 or so gauss shotty ammo and 500 handmade. And that’s not me being lazy that’s just all I use constantly shooting Earle because with the other players’ damage combined that’s all it takes
---
I know exactly what you're talking about and my point still stands..
---
There are bugs like magic weapons that you stumble on and do not need to go out of your way to happen. With your train of thought those who are just playing the game should be banned because of bad game code.
---
Other bugs like wall breaches that you have to try and do I could agree with you on.
---
The difference between a bug and an exploit are big.
---
Bugs just happen even if you dont want them to.
---
Exploits are bugs that you have to try and do.
---
So magic guns... Bugs.
---
Dupes... exploit.
---
I can't make the difference any more clear.
---
Every time I see a key-closed camp, I try to sneak in using windows or anything. If I get inside, I leave a bag of ammo to show that I could get in.
---
In fairness, it’s difficult to avoid shifting your pants when they’re non-removable.
---
Except that if the weapon in question is the Gauss Minigun then the Ammo Factory won't produce the rounds you need.
---
Hehe
---
Came here to say this. 👆
---
you need a fresh server apparently. You could ask someone to invite you to private server to see if you can complete it. 
---
Xbox?
---
First time I've seen someone gatekeep shitting their pants.
---
Is it? I use it to sell legendaries and they sell well. Should I use another place/guide to check prices?
---
Sorry mate but you've missed the point completely. It's not difficult to kill her in the air, but it's undeniably less ammo efficient and more time consuming than if you can get her to land.
---
Maybe one or two weapons for the rare fight, but finding high radiation fluids is too much of a PITA to do regularly.
---
True...but the “zealots” who make bold claims about not getting her to land for a variety of false or unproven reasons aren’t healing either.
---
Yep, all the time with this event, its caused by 2 different  things, 
---
1 it lands outside of the event area
---
2 i f you kill it too quickly it doesn't register.
---
So am I missing something, is there a game setting that is fucking me over because when I get close to something with the default headlamp on everything becomes washed out in bright white.
---
It's usually always bugged, if you can't see the scorchbeast then it's stuck somewhere. If somebody has already activated the device it can be stuck somewhere far away, and even if you kill it from range the event doesn't always complete. I get about 50% success rate doing it.
---
I have a aae I use and it seems to do alot better for me in semi auto..might just be a placebo though
---
Do both! If you nuke the Queen after ACP has been previously triggered, it will trigger again.
---
Go in, kill Earle, then jump to kill the Queen.
---
Not worth it imo, glowing blood 75 rad res + radx diluted 100res and you doing fine in nuke zones wearing PA, or clearing ghouls in burrows or whitesprings with regular armor. 300 extra rad res seems good on paper, but not saving you in nuke zones wearing regular armor 😒
---
Oh god thats what the "Toxic water" was
---
Hard quit/crash is what i use on pc. Quitting via ingame menu makes you leave the team
---
It's has most certainly been proven that the stagger effect in one gun army staggers her in the air and prevents her from landing. It can clearly be observed in a queen fight where somebody has the perk equipped, it's glaringling obvious to see. Further, hitting her with the cryolator in the air, by definition of the effect of the weapon will slow her mapping and landing.
---
There is a skeleton that was burying barrels of pre war money with a hazmat suit and gas mask beside it, a reference to Breaking Bad from what I recall.
---
..just an emote?
---
hauling tons of ammo, loot and gear while only RUNNING everywhere, being mutated and thus having accelerated metabolism needs severe amounts of CALORIES. ...
---
If you do the one south of watoga it's usually chilling in NAR repair yard. 
---
sometimes fats travelling to the event can fix it
---
The mechanics of the building in this game are so confusing. If what the other guy said doesn't work then my only other advise would be to attach a foundation to the second set of stairs before trying to remove the first set.
---
People complain too much.....sorry, but I fight the way I fight and she still dies.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
Personally, I don’t use that perk, nor do I use PA for the Queen fight.
---
If you’re patient, she lands. You really only need a few landings to kill her. If you don’t want to waste ammo, don’t.
---
Wood chucker perk then go to Helvetia I think. One of the towns has mega wood piles.
---
I never noticed it was so bad until recently, I got a legacy laser rifle so I've been using that and the durability just disappears so fast that's not even worth using over a fixer, handmade or any other rifle really.
---
most likey you joined the same private server you were om before
---
Good tips man thanks, ive been prioritising weapons over junk but i guess maybe its the other way round, unless its a new weapon i want
---
Yes - sometimes it helbs to tag the SB - this could cause her to help find the way back to the trap
---
I think its the same problem which causes SBs flying in their holes instead of flying in the sky - after you hit them, they will raise up in the sky
---
You just wrote my post for me.  :)    I'm 303.   I don't post weapons, etc., that aren't in demand.   The 30K cap is a constant struggle.
---
Me and my friend duo it all the time on private servers. 
---
Last night I was on public and saw it so I popped over. There were a couple of level 550's and me at 94.
---
I took my usual position on a catwalk and aimed towards the fence line...
---
Then I started hearing rapid gunfire behind me. So I turned to see mobs of scorched appearing in the air, 6 feet above the sonic and then dropping. 
---
We had a killbox! The spawns just kept coming. My explosive handmade emptied clip after clip. My score shot up faster than I could keep track of. I gained 4 spots in less than 5 minutes!
---
Then I leveled up. Shortly after... I leveled up again! 
---
I'd heard about it being bugged but I'd never actually seen it in action. I've gotta say it was quite fun just massacring them like that.
---
This! Plus I lie to the hunters to get their 100 caps and then kill them for ammo and scrap. 🤙
---
There's another breaking bad reference: two teddy bears in an RV with gas masks on
---
you never made enough
---
I thought about this yesterday as well. It’s super dumb.
---
I always run around reviving players with alcohol because my character is always drunk lol
---
When Wastelanders released I committed my heavy to the Gauss Minigun. I'm not entirely convinced it was worth the effort, but that decision was made worse when I went for the Prime receiver.   
---
People forget that time is the most precious commodity here. It's what made me consider rerolling as melee just to avoid the ammo upkeep. I mean, you have to launch two nukes, farm 2 locations, then farm lead, acid, and steel... NOW you can play the game? Naw. Not worth it.
---
Yes. You'll end up scrapping or selling most weapons but junk is always useful.
---
Because when we get done fighting Earl, SBQ or clearing the entire map of level 68 SM, etc., we don't want to come home and fight yet another monster.   Where are my repair stations, bed, and ally?   That's all I want at that point.
---
I wasn't swimming in it I was drinking. Please get your facts right.
---
is this really a thing!? first time i hear about. i use OGA in my PA-build...
---
To be fair I would guess everyone smells like shit anyway.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
Why?
---
Yeah, meatpiles and mob's dropped loot will persist if you reconnect within 14 minutes. Especially when a friend servers as an anchor on your private server.
---
I’ve never gotten a single enemy at my camp in the mire and I’ve been there for months
---
Nothing ever happens until it happens.
---
Go Helvetia and there is tons of wood stacked up behind the first building you come to and lots more stacked up around town. Fastest way to gather wood pile.
---
I tried using explosive bait. Didn't even look at it.
---
You've gone from completely missing the point, to accusing me of spreading false information, to now again not  understanding that if somebody staggers her with one gun army while she is entering a landing animation SHE WILL NOT LAND. 
---
You've then continued to COMPLAIN about people complaining in a thinly veiled insult to my post and retreated  behind a curtain of 'different strokes for different folks. 
---
There's some kind of ignorance and hypocracy to be analysed here but have a good one mate, bye 👋
---
Is there a particular forest?
---
Analyze first and put the fuse in after you analyzed it. 
---
Restart the game before you do it.
---
Same and I steal,the prewar monétaire on the des evertrime she gives me crap
---
Thanks!
---
I still manage to die.  (hangs head)   However, I had the same experience.   Resisted it to level 230 or so.   Now, at level 303, hard to imagine going back.
---
Really insipiring.
---
Yeah?   That's good to hear.    
---
I guess it turned me off when I watched 3 SBs destroy my partner's camp in the SD.   Really don't want to deal with any of that.
---
I thought it was Fallout 1
---
Sure but that mod will cost you 6900 caps
---
For both the mask bundle and jumpsuit bundle, the drop chance is 0.25%.
---
Source: Me. I am also searching for both of these little bundles.
---
Once the patch comes and here limbs can me crippled, one gun army will be very effective in crippling her wings and bringing her down, but for now if she is staggered while going into a landing animation she will stay in the air.
---
One of the (IMO) best outfit is comment reward from thzt event
---
So touchy...jeez.
---
This is why people can’t have a decent dialogue anymore.
---
What did it say.
---
The main issue I'm finding in this event is not any difficulty in taking out the queen but the increasing frequency of her going down suspiciously quickly. I have the feeling more people with magic weapons are behaving badly.
---
The people killing you are having fun.
---
OP nailed this one. I go into the event as PA heavy guns and I run around chasing Earle with my auto stim T65 and either the FFR explosive gatling or the Vampire FFR gatling plasma, I love the help of those clearing the wendigos. Yesterday I had 30 or so chasing me and out of nowhere a melee build and bloodied come running to the rescue and slaughtered them all so I could continue tanking Earle.
---
They are a community site, not Amazon. 
---
Giving constructive feedback is one thing, shitting on someone's work they've done for free for a community is another.
---
I do agree the price calculator could be better, but it is better than nothing and they do try to improve it. No need to be salty about it.
---
BTW, you would be surprised how many people prefer to give feedback on broken features in commercial projects. One company I used to work for did a website redesign, and allowed users to switch to a buggy beta to help test it out, or use the old website. The testing was a huge success and when they replaced the old website for everyone, it was pretty much bug free thanks to free user testing.
---
As others have stated, it's all the pellets in the first shot. Sometimes you'll even get multiple full damage shots off.
---
The IE is a beast. In VATS you will one shot everything except bosses. Enjoy!
---
You accused me of spreading missinformation when I explained your points irrelevance and then you took a shot at me "complaining". You've laid no foundation for civil discussion and are now perpetuating the conversation with classic deflection to reconstruct the narrative. Get lost bro.
---
Luck only gives you more Condition on gear found, unfortunately.
---
I got it to work for my newest character today. First, I replaced the fuse, then placed the sample in the analyzer, and then I just stepped into the booth, didn’t touch the terminal. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
My power armor needs a power wash.
---
It's been hit-or-miss in my experience. For the most part it's broken but once in a while it works.
---
A M E N
---
I gotta agree with this. Killing is a lot more fun than dying. Have you tried not dying?
---
I wish they had a modern updated version of that game.  I don't need like FPS or anything like that, just even a Fallout (1997) level of graphics for it.
---
yeah, magic weapons are a wild issue. My suspicion is the root of the issue and damage calculation must be so deeply entrenched in the games coding that they must be a nightmare to fix. But I know nothing about game writing at all lol.
---
I used to sell it all the time. Usually couldn't keep it in stock.
---
No, I said there are some people who spread misinformation...like claiming that standing on fences prevents her from landing or falsely claiming that general staggering her in the air keeps her from landing - neither of which is actually true.
---
You’ve presented a hypothesis, which, on the face of it, may or may not be true. I, personally, have never seen the Queen stagger out of her landing animation, ever.
---
Therefore, as a skeptic, I would prefer to see proof of this before accepting it as fact.
---
Haha I was actually at your camp a few hours ago, very cool setup you have
---
Oh, you...
---
Nah, it's got whatever the shitter version of a catheter is, so we all good.
---
Do you keep dropping into crowds?
---
It's south of the entrance. My camp is right above bravo. I get a pretty good view of the launch.
---
Scraping unyielding 🙈
---
Even when I was in cranberry bog, it was just floaters or a mob of super mutants, never a SB and my camp was never destroyed
---
Isn’t the whole point of this game is to help each other and survive together?
---
Effects do stack, except Chameleon. You only need one piece for the effect to trigger.
---
I'm not 100%sure what you're asking, but the acrobat effect (50% fall damage) does stack; get two pieces and jump off cliffs to your heart's content.  Eight reduction effects max out at 90%, total. That means 5 pieces of 20%reduced weapon weight will add up to 90%; and even if you have weight reduction perk cards, it's still 90%. Eventually these things will start taking up space, you can't trade them, even between your own characters, so it's best to just scrip abs rebuild until you get it just right.
---
Bugged mate.  I only do the one on the ash heap or bog.
---
Lol. I do that too.
---
I don't know if it's just coincidence, but from around 30+ ACPs I've finished, only one or two rewarded me with non-3\* legendaries - today I got AAE15r LMG, few days ago really decent heavy metal Chameleon/sentinel arm. I remember getting something good from SE once or twice from the beginning of the game (and I have 3200h+). So despite lack of repair kits and less amount of fluxes I prefer ACP.
---
It adds flavor
---
Agree^^
---
Nice ! I'd love the ability to build a nice clean pool in my camp. Yeah my lake is nice and all but I think scorchbeasts wee in it
---
My mistake, it seems I was internally trying to justify you're input assuming there was some sort of relevancy in your initial post. If what you're saying is true, why then did you use "scorched" if it was not directed at myself in any way?
---
Awesome!!
---
Think of all the exercise your character gets though
---
Crack bolt hole joint
---
Isnt the virus they are made with an cure against the scorched plague ?
---
It was a play on words - I used “zealot” in its traditional definition...although I now see that it could have been seen as a direct attack on yourself, which was not the case.
---
Sometimes, trying clever wordplay can backfire, and for that, I do apologize.
---
Gonna be hard to switch cores that way.
---
Very good point!
---
Like the entire forest area on the left side of the map is lloaded with logs. Fast travel to vault 76 and start wandering around.
---
Probably will come to the atomic shop at some point no doubt
---
What platform?
---
Shotgun builds are underrated.
---
Robobrain - Human After All.
---
Go to Sylvie and sons with woodchucker equipped.
---
IMHO stagger and cripple are overrated for the vast majority of pve. The only thing it would be useful on is the sbq if she didn’t stagger in the air. I swapped for luck of the draw permanently and haven’t missed it.
---
Google buy hacked weapons.
---
Yeah if i start ACP event with 900 Ultracite .45 i end up with around 1200 rounds.
---
Some are, for instance 2mm electromagnetic is simply because its far, far more economical than the regular 2mm. With ammosmith 2* you get like 108 prime vs 27 regular for the same cost in lead and steel, you just need flux and ultracite too but both are fairly easy to get.
---
Maybe your LCD brightness is too much because I don't have trouble seeing something when I'm up close or perhaps the area you were in wasn't dark enough .
---
Every "defend workshop" event drops a plan. Maybe not every one, but frequently enough to be worthwhile.
---
It causes the game to slow down to a crawl and becomes unplayable for everyone in the instance. However, the Tesla shooter may not see it, so they are unaware of its affects. Thanks for asking.
---
Give us mouth harps! And playable jugs! And washtub bases! A fiddle! A tambourine! 
---
Let’s us make jugbands!
---
Daily ops?
---
And maybe a different song to play. I don't know if that's common knowledge--all the instruments are playing different parts of the same song.

Not a bug... hack... they should be banned.
---
Little slow on the uptake huh.
---
That has been edited, initially it read "scorched".
---
Use asbestos lining on your chest piece to avoid the embers. New info out thanks to Tyr but he got it from one of the dataminers x something.
---
Yup it known but I also agree it would be cool if find sheet music plans and learning them lets you set different songs for your instruments
---
Playing since beta.   I have not primed one weapon yet.
---
you have shared slots, so basically every your character can have 6 x 1star legendary perk for free. Its huge boost.
---
Oh for a gauss mini that’s really good actually. You’re 70 per hit is like a million times faster than the fixers 250 per hit. I messed around with heavy guns for a bit and got my gauss mini around 50 per hit on the queens head and was able to solo her with that so I’d say 70 on Earle is sweet.
---
the ROI of materials is way, way better for the bullions to be primed. 
---
With Ammosmith 2* crafting regular 2mm is like 27 
---
With Ammosmith 2* crafting ultracite 2mm is like 108
---
Costs the same steel and lead
---
Nope, it was always “zealots”
---
Murgle can be killed but it respawns.  Someone always has to kill my cat when they visit my camp =\
---
Go pick some up.
---
I saw this yesterday, for the first time! A nuke into Monogah, then another one to Queen, and everyone running back to Monogah. Three bosses, two nukes. Amazing.
---
Also just after Earl, someone started Encryptid, and then it started a Line in The Sand. I've never had this luck honestly.
---
Does escaping the mine give anything differerent/better?  I escaped once got same type of rewards, so now I stay there and collect all loot and just get buried, lol. Respawn by mine and get rewards, still have my junk too. Rewards seem the same. So I dont escape anymore lol.
---
Why does it Party Boy/Girl add with it? Is this tea considered Pre-war alcohol?
---
I personally like the event to be somewhat stretched out, good XP and more chances at legendaries from the mobs
---
Buuut that goes out the window when she's stuck in the air
---
Ok. Everyone starts somewhere though!
---
And what does that do for ya
---
Ya could say that,but cha never know...fate is funny like that.
---
When it’s my time,I’ll get one.
---
I’ve seen people get em off of there private servers from vendorbots,so to say never...
---
Time will tell
---
I found out it falls under alcohol when I kept drinking it on my junkies build and after a while realised my DPS was a little lower than usual, check my stats and the alcohol addiction is missing, only thing in its place was this lovely tea
---
Its not hard to add "bloodied" to any build.. I go from full health two handed melee PA to bloodied explosive heavy guns with some rads and perk change out. If Earls lobby is full: I Melee PA and farm screws. If the lobby cant take on Earl, I switch to bloodied rip out his vocal sac.
---
Your life will get much easier once you let go of the desire to have a weapon for every ammo type. 
---
The only weapons that should be in your stash are legends you are storing to scrip when possible and a few situational weapons like heavy weapons for events. With the exception of weapons you want to use but can't until 'X' level. 
---
Everything else should be scrapped at a workbench or sold for caps.
---
I had a flamer once that killed 300 enemy's with 2 tanks. 2 taps on the fire button was enough.
---
Ah ok, but if I for example take a buffout in my junkies build my damage stays the same, also with alcohol. Maybe it was something else that has put down your damage.
---
The 15P discovery is cool though, take some updoods.
---
Can you still get the fatigues from the atom shop? Haven't played in awhile.
---
A launcher with mags?
---
If only wood was everywhere
---
But crippling the head will disable its head laser
---
And the frame drum (Exclusive to Welch Station). And the Metal Drum (Exclusive to Meat Week and the Nukashine Frat House). And the Chemical Barrel (Exclusive to Meat Week).
---
It’s not just that one. I agree that we should be able to, but it isn’t just the one.
---
Neat assortment of stuff. There are glitches that you can use to make your place look more lived in. For example, you can put stuff onto lower shelves by placing the item on top, and then moving the shelf so it's partially buried in dirt. The thing placed on top will start to glitch down when the shelf pops back to the surface. Repeat until it's in the right place then do the other shelves. If you overshoot a shelf, you have to start all over from the beginning but it's super easy, barely an inconvenience once you get the hang of it.
---
Yes, if you look at the crafting recipe for Sweetwater Special Blend, it contains Bourbon, I assume that is why its called Sweetwater **Special** Blend, because of the extra kick from the Bourbon
---
Question: my best weapon is a vampire gauss mini gun, also have 
---
a vampire 50 cal, final word &amp; a prime 50 cal. Would any of them be of any value in this event? 
---
I noticed that I don't have the blocker perk which I really want to get before going in. I was watching a video, where it might have been angry turtle who used it as part of his build.. I've noticed that for some reason I am missing crucial cards...probably because I've had no idea what I'm doing with perk cards for a very long time! 😬
---
Yeah,  grenade launcher it has a magazine.that you change.
---
They just became available September 2nd, they should still be there for a few days at least
---
enough? I'm toting over 5K shotgun shells.
---
Oddly I remember when I thought they weighed too much.
---
Also in real life, the more there is of something, the less valuable it is...but...in video game life, making something unrepairable means u have to be careful of how u use it. AND since it only drops in one place,  under a certain condition, with a low chance, kinda makes it more valuable
---
Sweetwater: so how was your tea?
---
Vault Dweller: [Perception 20] Tamsty
---
Did you get anywhere on this?  don't know that it is related, but I was playing along this morning, got kciked out and now  I can't get back in.
---
That's awesome!  I always wanted more stuff on the shelves. Thanks man!
---
Or a clean version
---
I've made a habit of drinking from the sulfur fountain at White Springs every run. That way if I've been shitting my pants I can get cured for free.
---
Hmm I might have to look into that then, maybe one of my mutations. Although maybe it was a fortunate bug because I've logged on and noticed my daytripper and daddy-o addictions have randomly disappeared on separate occasions (Spending a few hours to get enough to reapply them was a fun grind)
---
Still funny to think this is why the British love our tea so much, it's secretly 45%Abv
---
The weak lamp is what I hate most about Lucky Hole mine lead runs.
---
8 times in a row? You're far more persistent than I am. I'd have given up after the 6th time for sure.
---
less crying more playing
---
All the more reason they look the way they do
---
This event is becoming another Radiation Rumble.  Everyone just wanted to kill gouls for the points, now its just kill the wendigo spawns for the screws.  Don't forget about Earle!
---
You sometimes have to reequip things. I for example have a bug we're I don't get the defenses from my backpack, one reequip fixes it.
---
Make sure you check the 'usually' empty suitcases at the train stations as well. They are a common spot for players to leave surprises for others.
---
Not the standard 200 rep for completing *Retirement Plan.*. You get that even if something else kills the defector. You get +10 Settler rep for sending them to Foundation and +25 Raider rep for killing them and then telling Rocksy ‘Appalachia has a new corpse’. But that has to be truthful and by your hand, otherwise it has the ‘[Lie]’ prefix and you don’t get the bonus. 
---
Check out [this resource](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations) for more details and reputation guidance.
---
Thank you. I’ll see if that helps me from getting my butt kicked all the time.
---
Good question. It increases your VATS accuracy by 0.4% each level, and also compass distance (I think?).
---
So, +6% VATS accuracy in exchange for two perks on Charisma.
---
I do that sometimes too, if I have time.
---
Same reason we can't plant pumpkins or tarberry patches.
---
They really just don't give a shit about us being able to customize our characters as we see fit.
---
Escape artist is also a good perk for this scenario
---
Useless at 119?
---
Oh dear, my lvl 56 ass has a loooong way to go
---
My stealth sniper even with crits doesn’t put a noticeable dent in Earl’s health bar. I tag him and focus on the wendigos, and let the heavy guys take him down. Sadly, last time I was there I got killed as I was leaving, and could not get back in to retrieve that big pile of loot.
---
With my tank/melee unarmed hybrid build. I did crowd control for about five minutes. Keeping the power armor players free from harassing wendigos. At one point surrounded by 4-5. More damage I received the more damage I put out. Started to one shot them. Eventually went down once, to falling rocks/acid. Once I had my fill of screws. Pull out my bloody LMG and joined in taken down Earle.
---
Hate us cause you anus
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
There are all kinds of tricks for placing items closer than they want to go. One of my go-to things is to destroy the first item you place, put the next item down, then repair the original. That works great for the new junk walls.
---
&gt;anyone who doesn't have Fallout 1st 
---
I have Fallout 1st and I'm more casual than you, I can assure.
---
I just finished the vault raid and I now have access to gold bullion. I'm that casual.
---
first thing first, rifleman builds work well in day to day combat but they really fall behind when you face tanky boss enemies
---
instigating is nice for mobs, but absolutely useless against an enemy that will allways be under full health basically
---
your best bet if you want to keep your rifleman build would be either a furious or anti armor fixer/handmade/combat rifle with a semi auto reciever.
---
your damage per shot will be lower compared to lever actions/gaussrifle/hunting rifles, but the increased rate of fire and mag capacity will do you a great favor
---
overall though, dont underestimate your usefullness in the event.
---
You almost allways have players at the event that deal great damage and bring down earl on their own.
---
killing of the wendigos to help them focus on earl is a blessing
---
And if I know anything about Fallout mods there'll be some massive boob/ass 4kHD 18+ packs
---
I prime all my heavies get more ammo when crafting
---
Id like some options for male hair to be worn up with making me look like a peasant from fuedal Japan
---
I had to get vaxxed, MODUS wouldn't let me in the bunker otherwise
---
Its not always about levels tho. If you are at level 50 and planned your build good and you have great gear, you can kick the ass of a level 500 who has no idea about builds ect.
---
There is a ... workaround. Dm me if you wanna learn it, I don't wanna give spoilers public.
---
I was not aware of that bug, have an updoot for the info
---
&gt;	Only ever had 1 commando card so going for a commando build won't be easy unless I manage to unlock more with perk packs.
---
Every time you level up you have ability to select any card you want after level 50. No need to wait for a perk pack.
---
PvE and Nuclear winter got better regarding bugs, and PvE now has alot of content for new players, but Pvp in Adventure mode is a mess.
---
I do it all the time after I get the first piece for that slot.  If I get a better version, then I keep the new and scrip the old. For my main, the only reason I keep an Unyielding set is just in case I decide to go Bloodied, or for crafting. Otherwise, they don’t have much use.
---
Thats what friends are for
---
I’ve played since launch.... never lost progress on a quest randomly as you describe. 
---
If you log off mid quest and haven’t hit a checkpoint, yes you will probably lose progress. There is no quick safe. It’s not a bug.
---
Well realistically, it is a bit of over kill, but on my Bloodied rifleman I already had the charisma necessary and more, so wasn't much of a burden to get this setup, just thought it was a cool find that one drink can give such a big stat boost is all
---
It's true, I used to server hop in watoga there are like 4 pa spawns in close proximity and I'd grab all the armor and fill cores I could get
---
I'm always missing it when joining or switching servers. It's annoying but I can live with that.
---
at least 5
---
It's got bourbon in it.
---
Glad to hear that. My not very optimised squishy babe does what she can but usually concentrates on reviving and pot shots on the spawns after tickling Earle a bit.
---
If you have the armco machine it makes 5.56 super fast.  Faster than I actually use sometimes depending on what I'm doing in game.  If they nerf the production rate I would consider priming it but as it stands I haven't had to craft 5.56 in months and use my handmade a lot.   Free ammo is nice!
---
@waster1993 it already takes forever and crashes 😆 what’s 30 more seconds gunna hurt?😆
---
Thanks you all! I hope it’s fixed in the next update... i hope!
---
*You’d think with a Perception that high you would have noticed the typo.*
---
 Not covid compliant.
---
Probably, but I can dream
---
The raider survival tent has the barrel drum, so does the Crater
---
Either way, doesn’t change that they can’t be placed in camps.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Look it up on here a video on YT it’s been a while so idk what it’s called, but from what I remember it’s him being a masognistic POS
---
I know, but it's not exclusive to meat week so people who are curious can still go play it
---
I had to do this a few time, but it actually worked.
---
You were not useless, you were killing the wendigo spawns, so that in itself is useful.
---
I once died from   dysentery...
---
Go into your settings and turn damage numbers on. Then notice after each kill they get higher
---
Because our companions will never get off them and Bethesda is taking pity on us
---
All I want and all I've been asking for, is a long ponytail with bangs!!
---
Wavy hair would be nice too!
---
Are you mamking fun of my speemch impemdiment? I like cheemsburbgers
---
Following that thought...
---
There are only 2 types of people that wear Chinese Stealth Armor:
---
1. Those who pee in their suits. 
---
2. Those who deny it.
---
You could also try taking a RAD-X to see if a mutation might be affecting your output.
---
I think this might have to be it.
---
No I don’t quite consider paying to win I’m not winning anything just because I have more stash space doesn’t mean that I’m doing any better in the game than you maybe I’m a hoarder
---
Chorro 💨💦
---
Eventually got this working on the 4th attempt, was driving me nuts. thanks for your help
---
Yeah either way I guess this games always going to have people unhappy should go back to ESO I guess lol
---
An instigating lever is fine for anything under 2K hp and if you get the first shot.
---
For anything else you are hard pressed when it's hp is higher, as your damages drops off to maybe 200/shot. And Earle and SBQ? Well you are SOL because they have a flat 70-75% damage mitigation and a fuckton of hp.
---
Since you have all the rifle perks that means you can change them for the commando perks and get an automatic rifle if you don't want to keep on playing the garbage disposal for the adds.
---
Everyone who sent me a friend request has been added to a group chat, I would like to have the event Saturday or Sunday evening
---
Dude, these are awesome!
---
I don't have the patience for stuff like this, otherwise I'd be trying my hand at recreating favourite venues from the other games too. Well done!
---
Yes, literally this is very weird. Absolutely no robots spawn when the scorched earth event is happening, this was one in a billion I suppose 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Oh yea and remove ghoul slayers, mutant slayers, hunters, and all those too.
---
1070 is still nothing to sneeze at.  Still going for $300-$400 new.
---
I run one with an overclocked i5 and it is smooth at 1920x1080.
---
Wouldn’t you want to be able to buy some extra space?
---
They are guna be sold in the atom shop
---
Shoot my buddy's brahmin and fire off any tank statues that I come across.
---
Right but I don’t see them changing it anytime soon they’ve already said 800 pounds is a lot and once you want to be able to buy some extra space? A dollar for 20 pounds don’t seem bad
---
Myself personally I wouldn’t mind bumping the stash to 1000 but I also don’t hold weapons as much as other people or ammo as I’m more melee
---
People spend $15 on a mask when you could spend $15 and get 200 pounds you know most of the stuff on the item shop I don’t care for what I would care for is stuff to actually benefit my character not make me look like a fool lol

Interesting idea for a mod.... The whole migration of the Quincy group, Oregan trail style.

Damn that’s a pain. I voluntarily walked into the drill the first time cause I wanted to see if it would hurt and to see if it was hornwrights
---
Chameleon pieces do stack a stealth bonus but you're absolutely correct in saying you need one peice for the invisibility whilst crouched and not moving to trigger
---
So just a standard Saturday night then
---
I mean you could totally get it as a drop. I was referring to someone selling it to you for what you said it wasn't worth. They are super rare drop
---
And Maily weapons most of them weigh a ton you know what I mean it’s just I want to be able to put my money towards something that can actually benefit my character not just some costume and honestly fallout first isn’t even worth it Unlimited stash space for junk. Honestly all the scrap that I accumulated when I had fallout first 80% of it still in the stash box

The train car just north of whitesprings station has a Dark and a Cranberry every day.  It is the one with the scavenger inside.

Sell Davenport's photos to someone else just to piss him off and hear his rant.
---
I only seem to have 1 commando card when I look?  I scrolled to end of all available cards and only 1 commando card there?
---
Nope. Everyone gets a keycard.  He was likely just a dick.
---
Yeah not keen on FOM bloodied builds.
---
I will see if I can get a better lever rifle - it does 213 x2 from a sneak shot and 186 base damage, but not much against bosses.
---
Will also look at commando build options if I can find the cards.
---
No, both people can get a NK from the drop. Its also not junk, so not something you would drop in death.
---
People can't kill you unless you shoot back at them. Stick around and taunt them for awhile to get them to shoot even more bullets that all deal 0 damage to you. As for the keycard thing, no. Usually you won't see other players hunting for the same key card you are. Out of probably 150 key card hunts I've seen other players chasing the same bot 5 times.
---
Skipping the end of 2020 I see...
---
Good choice
---
The Frame Drum is at the Sons of Dane compound as well. I think the barrels might be there also but I can’t remember
---
That's cool :)
---
Barrels definitely aren’t, that area was in the game before there were playable ones.
---
Or cranberries, snap tail reeds, bloodleaf, etc.
---
Have you seen the radiation?
---
You select new cards when you level up.
---
My chemist wants his chemical barrel.
---
yes, but none there to pick from available list.
---
I didn't unlock them when I was levelling below 50.
---
Yeah it's been bugged for months And I don't think there has been any word from Bethesda about it

Fixer in adventure mode but still broken in nw.

Weird that anyone is down voting this post, seems to be a lot of trolls on this reddit.
---
The people who have these weapons are down voting it.
---
I'm roughly in the same situation and currently working on getting commando cards as well. However, like others said, don't count yourself out in ACP. I focus on picking off the wendigos while stealthed and reviving any downed players. Believe me, no one has ever complained lol
---
Lol look at you, simping.
---
Now I really want to see a video of a live scorched robobrain so I can hear the audio it makes...
---
When a scorchedbeast does its crop dusting attack it’ll turn animals into scorched, do you think if that attack hits a robobrain it’ll turn it scorched right in front of you?
---
(Or maybe even see human NPCs turn into scorched when hit by the attack?)
---
They should change the skinned weapons to just lose the skin if dropped. If I'm not mistaken, Nuclear Winter kind of does it already, so it shouldn't be an issue.
---
I had a few likd that but the empty spaces bugged
---
Yep! Sweetwater’s special ingredient is an entire bottle of bourbon!
---
Genuine question: how do you know they're shooting five bullets per shot?
---
This!
---
Please believe me,when I say,that what you say Is 100% accurate.
---
I had spent months trying to get one,until I gave up,&amp; decided they where not worth what everyone was asking,to me personally...
---
&amp; figured I’d let RNG or fate take the wheel...
---
I want one,but only so I can complete my set,as they have no actual bonuses,It’s purely for looks/completion sake.
---
No problem bro
---
I can see five bullets come out of their gun with a single shot. They explode too and that makes it easy to see.
---
Tbh, I really don’t know. I’ve never seen a scorched mob transmitting the plague to other mob.
---
Note - you can have the blend and another alcohol active at once! If you add cola nut, and chug a nuka dark, you can add + 6 to str and end at the same time. Then add in a berry mentats or grape mentat for even stupider stat gains.
---
I just checked and I have access. What troubleshooting steps have you taken so far?
---
Easy answer, whenever you get hit with ballistic bullets or certain weapon types a sound effect plays for each hit.
---
Some people have the best/worst luck?
---
Oh god why did you say this
---
Ah as far as I know I haven’t seen infected mobs turn other mobs scorched, only way I’ve seen stuff turn scorched was via scorched beast dust cloud. I once saw a mirelurk queen turn scorched down by fissure site prime, it spawned outside the little building with the workbenches and a scorched beast crop dusted it.
---
sounds like a 2SE modded for auto
---
Ive never heard of a hacked weapon that fires 5 rounds..
---
Hard reset my xbox, switched profiles, taken game out of the xbox, reset my wifi. All i am getint is a spinning circle next to both of them like the buffering wheel you get when ur net is slow, but my net is over 70 MB i dont think that is the issue
---
Now you have heard of them. I know what a TSE is and is not what these are.
---
the daily ops thats coming will satisfy some of this. it will take place in many locations and have boss fights with waves. some have objectives also
---
Sounds like my two NW experiences. 
---
I think there is only 2 types in NW now. 
---
Complete newbs, who just end up fodder for the other type, high level know all tryhards.
---
Until lobbies get grouped to a levels range, I will pass.
---
The question is, how did a Robobrain got there? Walking from watoga? 😂 I’ve never seen a single robot spawn in this specific event
---
The last interview I saw said that events like ACP and Scorched Earth would scale, however there would be a level minimum to how low some enemies would scale. My assumption is that the spawns in ACP would only be as low as level 40. I don’t think I’ve seen wendigos spawn any lower before,and don’t see cause that they should spawn lower with One Wasteland. It probably won’t help with scaling Earle down for them too much since I’m theory they’re going to do similar damage to him as a high level player, but they could definitely take care of some adds.
---
I cry a singular tear as i hope for this luck
---
It still sounds like a connection issue, somewhere along the way. If it was the shop itself, no one else could get in.  
---
I hope it works for you soon.
---
"Prototype Alien Blaster" we need it
---
Ah the army camp closest to the train station will sometimes spawn a robobrain. The one full of robots?
---
I'm pretty sure bethesda said that they were not gonna scale down big end game bosses like the queen, or Earle. I 100% beleive a level requirement should be put in place for the event
---
Ooh, I've honestly never noticed any particular sound effects apart from the shot itself and my character grunting
---
You should be able to lock items by now
---
Ah, don't think I've encountered this myself but definitely will keep an eye out
---
But it’s still far, and mobs don’t chase you across the map
---
Ok thank you, thats what i dont get, i can load into the game which requires a connection, i can surf the xbox store but cant seem to open up the atomic shop
---
Yep add control and stimmer right here 🙋🏼‍♂️
---
 I did it just caus3 it tells you too ive only done the event like 4 timess but  what happens  when it collapes and ur still jn the   lower level of the mine?
---
It also looks incredibly good with a gauss rifle.
---
Make sure not to kill it till it gets right up to the trap too, or you will not be able to finish the event.
---
I dont feel like a hero, it feels natural after some damage on the Boss and noticing (almost) nobody is concentrating on the spawns, then fine ill do IT. As long the bullits hits a enemy it shouldnt matter!
---
Arrrhhhh, and this should be an easy event?! 😂😂😂
---
It's possible that they are Children of Atom
---
I’ve had that happen a few times, but usually a system reset or modem reset fixed those kinds of issues, or it goes away within an hour.  And it is odd that you can have a strong enough connection to play an online game, but not enough to look at static displays.
---
It really works with another alcohol active? Well damn. The only reason I haven't been using it during ACP was I didn't want Ballistic Bock getting cancelled out. Thanks for the info.
---
I'll stay with dense chest and fireproof but thanks!
---
Isn't it ironic that you are giving feedback on Reddit, but you don't want to do it on their website?
---
The only boss that’s glitching and falling through the ground is Earle at A Colossal Problem. Otherwise play the game as you normally would.
---
I know you forgot to go back and loot which is a huge pain. In future raids arm yourself with some scrapping kits. Raid all the crap after you clear a room. Once you feel that you have enough junk on you use the kit to send it back to your scrap box. I do this sometimes if I need to go on a 'loot all the things' materials run in the asylum.
---
I'll take yall on in PvP. I jus cane back from an account wioe so I'm low level and getting my shit together but I'm down.

I wasn't in front of my game when I wrote this, but I know the unmodified weight is 6.0, and I thought my carry weight is 0.1, although I could be wrong.  Happy now?  And don't call me Shirley.
---
You have to wait for the display to go from prepare to fight to kill the scortchbeast I believe. The cliff more one had been spawning deep in the forest for me as of late. Have to keep aggroing it from a far. Till it comes running.
---
Yes you can; it will ask you twice I’m before you scrap an item that’s favorited if you really want to.
---
Also the flute
---
Take a screenshot (with their name visible) and report them.
---
Do you have plans for the Ultracite Laser Pistol? Crafting and scrapping is the fastest way, though I’ve run across mods as event drops and know the drop or spawn. I just don’t think it’s very common.
---
Usually after I blow the legs off, it doesn't have much health. I suppose to be efficient you could target the arms next. Taking limbs off does major damage to bots.
---
Its nearby players and its just a chance for stimpacks to be shared (seems to be ~50%) and it is only to nearby players. Its honestly kind of a sucky perk purely because of the chance thing and the way its description is written it makes me think it was intended to be a guaranteed proc but it isnt
---
Eh? I’ve had mobs chase me across the map before. Mostly stuff like radscorpions and mole rats, but the other day I accidentally shot a settler in the defense random encounter north of the whitesprings station and he chased me all the way to the front gate of whitesprings before I fast traveled away.
---
(I forget the official term for it... Leash? When an enemy in a video game can’t chase you outside of its spawn I think? Sometimes it feels like some enemies in 76 don’t have a leash... seen some pretty persistent creatures hell bent on killing me.)
---
Could also be possible it was a mob summoned by the SBQ that just has a very low chance to appear.
---
I don’t really have an issue with it but seems some players do. And it’s clearly not enough apparently.
---
Most builds have the ability to be completely maxed out between levels 55 and 70. My heavy gunny was completely done leveling at level 68, shotgunner: 56. Check out nukes and dragons. It’ll let you build your character with the cards you want and tell you how to get there.

*I can sssmell you nasssty hobbitsesss.*
---
On a side note, do the legendary perks give me more points in special to put cards in? Orrr
---
No i dont have the plans,  i just got a legendary drop and wanted to make it to a rifle
---
You get that sweet reward of a nocturnal rolling pin from the queen? Id rather kill eral than the queen. Earl does not fly around for 20 of the 30 minutes you ha e to complete the event. The event rewards are almost identical but earl usually gives better legendaries and the event legendary reward is usually 3 stars for me not 2 like the queen.  Also get 8 notes not 3 or 4 is it?The queen seems like a frustrating waste of resources. Usually have earl dead pretty quick. Need to farm the crap out of the event now because when the nerf hits with patch 22 he will be near impossible. Least that's my opinion.
---
They have been updating it, though the last iteration was from 2011.  
---
It's no longer a casual travel across the continent, it's a survival simulator. I tried playing it one time in college, I was soo confused with the game.
---
You navigate the starting town via wolfenstein 3D style, old school 3D maze movement. 
---
There's multiple shops that sell things at different prices. 
---
There are multiple gun types from muskets, blunderbuss, pistols, etc.
---
You don't just buy bullets, you buy rounds and black powder, like shot pellets for a blunderbuss, and lead balls for muskets.
---
They have medicine, but it's not simple, they sell it as ingredients you have to mix. Like lavender and mint.
---
You have oxen, horses, donkeys, etc pack animals.
---
Whats this about legwork?  All you need to a nuclear card and the code, you don't need to collect the code pieces.
---
I wish they got rid of these bugs. It realy takes some of the fun out of the game.
---
It's 5% health per crit. However a medics shotgun is 40% per crit thanks to 8 pellets × 5% health.
---
Nice I still havent got a better monitor have a nice for the time Asus that's 60hrtz. But I'll definitely pick this up on pc.right now the only thing playing on that is roblox with my kid.lol
---
as in, the stash could have 3 (weight reduction) perks slotted into it?  I doubt that would ever happen because it is so novel -- perks can only be used on the player.  However there is a mechanic that does include weight reduction modifiers added to inanimate objects: legendary effects.  A legendary stashbox (restricted to 1-3 of the weight reduction legendary effects) would be super cool.
---
hmm. i've never noticed it not working.
---
I mean I was there for like 3 or 4 months. I liked it bc it was soooo flat omg. I miss it. I think it’s proximity to fissures. I had a friend who built in savage divide and had the same problem bc he was near a fissure site. His place got destroyed constantly.
---
I'm pretty sure my cat is rooting for mine.  My collectron wants to harvest my dead body for bone shards
---
Ive heard of bigfoot too. I dont believe in that either...
---
I was fully automatic in vats, with multiple crits per clip, it should have accumulated to something noticeable but it didn't.
---
It's fixed now. But 5 points is waaaay to much to spend on that perk. Well at least IMO
---
😂😂😂
---
That's not what we want.  We want to be able to lock items.
---
Most hacked weapons have beam splitters attached to them, often invisible.  This multiplies the actual damage dealt, and often even creates a "magic" weapon if used in vats with blocker's armor.
---
No kidding, maybe this should be Fallout Miami, those things are everywhere.
---
I would like it if they just upped the flux cost to mod the gun, but it uses normal ammo.
---
I have two furious swing speed cultist blades, ones a 2* and the other a 3* with reduced weapon weight, I got these a long time ago though, before the first meat week I think. Now they’re not in the legendary loot pool I think.
---
20 or less, not starting at 200.
---
Ive tried standing next to a friend and using it but it didnt seem to work first try every time.
---
Have you tried adjusting the music and dialog sound controls under settings?
---
Happy with that too!
---
Riot shields are made out of Lexan and other high-strength plastics, and I don't think that material exists in the Fallout universe.  They haven't made many advancements in plastic -- thats why so much of their goods are made from metals and alloys
---
Yeah youd need 20 crits to pull of a fuell health bar. Its quite bad.
---
Or just collect the rewards before the end date. I’m sure you have your reasons. But rather than just hold out because you hope for being able to claim after seems like setting yourself up to be upset.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/qsyzHwI](https://imgur.com/a/qsyzHwI)  
---
This is what they look like, its always the same,  
---
beam splitter at the front and that floating scope on top, effects are always bloodied, explosive, plus a 3rd (to me unknown) effect.
---
You have advantages over non subscribers, so its p2w, even simple junk stash saves so much space
---
I wont waste a nuke card on ACP again, I always get stuck with noobs who can't do any damage or they are there only to collect screws.
---
r/fo4
---
How much damage is that weapon poison?
---
I've read a couple different values, and I don't know how much poison resist is out there, especially on bosses
---
I had more than enough crits for that, as a sneak commando I didn't need any heals for myself, so the issue is either the range on the team heal... Or the heals don't proc on public teams.
---
Well, ye, ppl buy them for sure. But at this point i dont even know how to spend my 30k caps on 5 characters lol (dont suggest serum recipes)
---
There's another season, mate.
---
I figured more damage good so I went with it. I’m a 135lvl new 3 month player lol
---
I'm clearly talking about 76
---
OMFG just collect the damn rewards
---
How’d you get the word Acutely to have that font in your description? Looks fancy.
---
Nuclear Winter gives you a fair amount....but you have to play Nuclear Winter.
---
Did you ever find out?  I'm now wondering how much it is.  Especially if there's poison resistance out there, like on bosses
---
Have the same issue on my PC (RX 5700 from Sapphire), very sad to see.
---
Some of us have clean Chally suits thank you very much.
---
There is detergent all over the wastelands being filthy is a choice
---
They posted on the forums that you need to collect before it ends.

---
also not on a private server.  I do the Morgantown nuke run about once a week, and can get at least 15 High Radiation fluids just from wandering around.  And twice as many Hardened and Glowing masses too, if needed.
---
Oh there you go its range. It has about the same range as a stimpak diffuser which is pretty abysmal that'll be your problem.
---
Lol nerd
---
Hoarders..... Smh.
---
Probably trying to hold onto those script rewards for the sale. Bethesda ain't letting that happen.
---
I've considered buying it for one month, and loading up the scrapbox with everything I could find, then cancelling.
---
I can’t kill wendigo spawns but my medic lvl 30 ass will run like a bat out of hell to save you
---
Report them where?
---
Yep, that’s it.
---
I know exactlty the one you're mentioning. Ive had run ins on Xbox. Runs out of content, and turns to "justified" bullying to be an ass clown for views. That, or they start pvp, lose, and pull out the Tesla and legacys. Then come the flood gates of kids server hopping, and sending PMs. Not sure if it was direct friends or others that watched his content. Either way I've since watched any content from the channel an unsubbed.
---
Yeah I don’t get this. Scrip is never going entirely run out. It’s a game. Just playing it gets you more scrip. Gets you more legendary story turn in for scrip.
---
I have several legacy energy weapons and I hardly use any of them, maybe once in a month, it’s just not worth it to pew pew then immediately repair then repeat. Many other weapons are just as effective but aren’t made of cardboards
---
Disappointment, mostly but I'd recommend t65

In the support center on bethesda.net:

---
TIL Sean Connery plays FO76.
---
Very well done. After crashing during multiple builds and also hitting budget mid build a few times I don't put muh effort in anymore. Budget is definitely a camp killer
---
The start of Emmet Otter role play.
---
It's not really about pen, but the way energy dmg is calculated. Also you can't reliably sneak with it so unless they buff it by like 300% it will be trash anyways.
---
Yeah, and Troubleshooter's armor helped me out a lot in that respect, too.
---
They should all be available unless you haven’t actually taken cards for the past 70 levels when you level up. Post a screen shot next time, are you looking under the correct special category?
---
Removing all the warning labels from household items would also fix this issue, by funny coincidence.
---
Yep! It’s counted as a tea, which is why herbivore has an effect.
---
I personally think they should change it to function as one and add an intelligence penalty, because it’s a very strong consumable right now.
---
Yes, but I don’t think they should be able to personally. Oh well...
---
WV Lumber Co in the Northwest corner of the map.  Free up some space before you go, because there is a ton of wood.  Usually has some supermutants hanging around it.
---
I got my friends to help me in the event and i got a executioners explosive handmade. They got mad since they got trash.
---
Looks cozy
---
Check your chats/dms.
---
Shit well its no use for back of the action support, medics need to be upfront and tank as f...
---
I got one if you want to trade
---
And assassins
---
What about how halfway through the season the cursor speed on the legendary run screen dropped by half
---
It's made of people!
---
Gotcha, so they're somehow hacking the game so they can add that mod to TSE rifles... pricks
---
Yeah!!! I’m down for that! Get people to dress in the different mascot costumes
---
Yeah, he wasn't that far from the Whitesprings fissure.
---
I have no suggestions, but I love it and hope you get it to work.
---
I have an IE Shotgun. In vats it is insane but compared to FO4, the shotgun feels incredibly weak outside vats.
---
The problem is that the events have no meaningful loot to justify replay after you've gotten all the rare rewards. The longer the event is around the less likely it is you'll find people motivated to do it.
---
If you dont want a feisty collectron dont take the raider one lol
---
It may be more than that. I have personally seen rings for sale in vendors that have legendary perks. I have seen screen shots of weapons with 10 perks. I have personally seen an auto grenade launcher fire about 20 rounds a second for at least a minute straight.
---
All player on player healing in this game seems to be proximity based
---
Good story. I want to hear more like that. On the other hand, I got griefed the other night during Guided Meditation. Dude way higher level than me just started killing me over and over, don't know why, maybe I accidentally hit him with a shot? I don't know, was very annoying.
---
Whats a radstag knife
---
Yes Irrational Fear! I love that one but it is pretty rare for some reason.
---
Now that sounds like a great evening
---
If you're within the bounds of a player camp or workshop, opening what would otherwise be a public safe triggers the wanted status because the game thinks that safe belongs to that person.
---
Not saying it should be that way but that's how it works.
---
Our tank does well in power armor and a vampires limb damage buzz saw blade, he never dies and Earl's legs are perma crippled.
---
Shame I can't keep anyone else healed unless I get too close.
---
Yeah, I brought in my 50 cal and used like 3-4K ammo. Barely any return.
---
Gatling gun has such a slow rate of fire, I reloaded maybe twice with a 500 clip, and had the same amount of ammo I went in with once it was over.
---
What about the melee guy that destroys it!? I love the spawns they equal adrenaline. Adrenaline equals 3750 to earles face. Bye, bye earle😙
---
I know mate
---
Right but wouldn’t this kind of even the odds I’m not saying it Hass to be in fallout first even if they Added it to the atomic shop where you could buy 20 pounds for a dollar I think everybody could do that I am in no means have money but I could save up a dollar for some extra weight I’m not saying it’s just for the people in fallout first
---
I've never actually been to the locations where they launch, something to do. Cheers for the idea. 👍
---
The true question you should be asking is not will you be able to but should you?
---
That and not everything scales 1-to-1. Apparently more end level stuff won't scale all the way down to new players. I imagine this event is no different.
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! WE DID IT!!
---
As my second edit states the issue seems to be resolved but for the 2 or so hours after the hotfix i was never able to join back into the same world. I only once, and at first, got the telltale hotfix error of "Failed to find world". 
---
I am consistently on at the times of hotfixes and after and have never seen this issue. When it was happening I wanted to quickly warn others that something was wrong to minimize losses. I, for one, expect hotfixes at noon on Thursday but not 11:00 est on a Wednesday. But I always have another account in with me when transferring after I got burned once by a hotfix they didn't post about until an hour later.
---
Sure. Just, you know, keep that attitude there and not know a public server.
---
how do you think earle got like that........using the same cath over and over now he is just one giant swollen 3 testicle bad comb over thing spewing pusssssssss all over the likes of us.  not a big deal to me im protected by a shit cocoon.
---
Junk is the life blood of this game. You use almost all of it a lot.
---
Glad you're enjoying it bud :)
---
Medic's shotguns w/ 4 leaf clover or Team Medic seem to be the only semi-reliable mutli-player healing methods
---
I know a guy who crashes servers during events with spawned guns. He has orbital strikes, mini nuke miniguns and much more. They are taking care of him tho, got him on video last time he did that
---
I think you mean Publishers, not Developers.
---
Literally every question you asked about the guns and ammo was already answered by watching the linked video.
---
Was it ever resolved for you or still ongoing?
---
That level of technology is out of our reach like washers and driers.
---
I was going to say 4, but I think you're right.
---
Thats so if you time it correctly a group of people playing instruments doesnt sound bad.
---
Whiskey and nuka-dark, right perks, grants +6 str
---
I do the same
---
I've noticed this too. Was waiting for awhile wondering if the event was stuck then saw a Scorchbeast chilling in the distance. Was in the cranberry bog area. I got the sniper out to hit it, and that kick starred the event luckily.
---
What’s a good price?
---
Ill keep trying hopefully it,ll work soon, thanx for the advice 👍
---
Well your username certainly checks out
---
Cranberries only grow in bogs. You can't plant them in solid soil and expect them to live.
---
Well now I know why I got my one and only wanted status.
---
HOLY RUN ON SENTENCE BATMAN
---
I don't have Fallout 1st anymore, but it is still happening in my friends server!
---
Never understood the whole "the game was a mess at launch" legend people refer to. 
---
I've played since the moment the PS4 servers went live during BETA. At no point has my game been "a mess."
---
Well, I WAS drinking it. What i was TRYING to do was pick up the ammo on the river bed.
---
If you're on PS4 you can use my private server
---
There are still deal breaker bugs but they're situational and don't always occur. 
---
Nothing so severe as reverting to a past state but the worst of it is a server crash or respawn bug that doesn't allow you back into an event.
---
It's really dependent on your bug tolerance level.
---
You'll use 3 guns of the same type most of the time. They'll be on you. Then your box is for stuff you're selling, junk, excess aid and plans you're trading. You should also pick one gun and focus don't, spread your special abilities out. Example don't use rifles and shotguns just use rifles and get every perk for it. Build new characters to use different weapons. With this focus you'll be slamming at level 60.
---
Grape for lower levels. It removes rads but not mutations.
---
Wastelander is dummy sick! The flarp of his buttcheeks keeps alerting the scorched!
---
All of them. Lol.
---
Yayyy more free shit for doing nothing.
---
In his most recent video, Angry Turtle even stops to rant a bit about hacked weapons on PC (which wasn't meant to be the topic of the video). But yeah, you can clearly see in the video footage somebody using a hacked .50 cal with a beam splitter on it.
---
You can DM me for the fixer plan. I have one for sale
---
Don't know why you're being down voted, passing items to a friend is the ONLY safe method!
---
Yes. there was a whole article about it and everything.
---
Ballistic Bock. It got a recent uprising
---
I mean yay for big number but Perception isn't that big of a deal once you get to a certain point.
---
Do you find that anything significantly changes once you get your +15 bonus?
---
Hilarious.
---
Can support what you are saying, this is one of my characters:

I barely notice the heals with my fixer
---
A year ago, when my son was 2 and really struggling with his speech, he would sit on my lap and push the 'e' key on my keyboard to interact with the train whistle. He really seems to enjoy that and, as a side note, his speech is much better. Last night he was on my lap while I was playing and he said he wanted to go down the hole to fight the boss. It took me a few but I realized and confirmed he was talking about the A Collosal Problem event. I was so proud :'-)
---
Bit like the Mole Miners
---
I try, even if i run out of stims ill just get you wasted and back into the fight.
---
I am playing since beta, usually several hours a day together with my wife, and we haven't seen a single hacked weapon once.
---
While I agree that those weapons need to be deleted, I wonder if this is a regional thing. On European PC server here.
---
That’s tough to say. If you have a great CAMP theme and you’re there in-character?  Possibly up to 10 caps for regular drinks and maybe 25 for speciality. But that’s on the very generous side. 
---
If you’re going to just have them listed in a vendor and nothing special about the camp, I usually wouldn’t pay more than 25% of the item’s listed Base Value.
---
I'm one of those! I have nuclear key cards I hate launching nukes. If anyone is down to launch them I will be more then happy to give up the key cards.
---
5 ranks of demo is not needed.  1-2max is all u need.
---
You've missed... a lot.
---
&gt; instigating lever action rifle
---
Nah. What you mean is an ordinary level action rifle. Instigating is only good on full health enemies so that's why it's ok for the spawn but utterly useless for Earle.
---
The advice is to either switch to a semi auto rifle like combat/fixer/handmade or switch your build to commando.
---
Your build is only good for support in its current state.
---
It all depends on ammo. I turned 40 plasma cores into 76 when converting to prime. Gain ammo for 20 flux and 20 ultracite. Definitely worth it imo
---
Yup. Same thing happens if someone owns a workshop and you're not grouped with them. Found that one the hard way too
---
I mean, it kind of does at that point. Just like if you added a lock to an existing door in a workshop and it was picked, that would also make you Wanted. 
---
The game does need to do a better job of warning about the Wanted status. Either all of the Wanted potential locks show as red, or a one-time pop-up per lock that has a warning.
---
Unless it is one of the glitched ones which will always be amazing.
---
Yeah. I think you're forgetting about the thing they fixed. Not many people even realised it was broken.
---
I can see that, it's why I made the post
---
I know mate.  Took me ages to get my full set of unyielding.  Still don’t have +strength on any.
---
Better than my medics fixer, yeah looks like we'll have to try and coordinate our groups to stand closer together or just go back to dishing out damage.
---
Well technically, it's the remnants of a bug in FO4, you can fudge the weapon editor to allow for mods to go on weapons they are not supposed to, there is a video tutorial on this somewhere on youtube and i believe in that case he attached a MIRV to a pipepistol, so that the gun would use .38 ammo, and shoot at full auto, but it would be launching nukes at that pace.  
---
looked up the video for you:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oM\_UTdfaPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oM_UTdfaPc)
---
It could be your garage door causing the issue. I had to remove the door from my blueprint to avoid the "item needs suport" error.
---
People still complain about low levels.  If ur failing CP with low levels, then ur not as strong as u think u are.  
---
I do this with low level players every dam time and have yet to fail event.
---
Killing the prize bot ASAP and doing AWOL. Honorable mention, grabbing fusion cores out of generators.
---
There’s some at Aaronholt homestead just chilling in the soil
---
Sorry bud, this is one of those git gud moments.
---
There's a lot of reasons why NW sucks. Little if any covers what you dealt with.
---
I like the loot from earl but I like that you get more stable flux from the queen vs earl. Atleast with the queen I can use the flux I get to replace the ammo I use vs earl where you only get 2 or 3. And I use way more ammo for earl than the queen. But Earl's loot us pretty nice.
---
There's a bug that makes your nuke miss. One time I clicked the mine dead center (I checked in shadowplay to be sure), and it missed. Thankfully I was saved by the other bug that spawns the event when someone else had previously nuked the mine.
---
I've only used the laser rifle and gatling plasma legacies, good to know the rest of them break quickly too.
---
I’m going for +Int or +Agi on my bloodied riflewoman character. I’d also be happy with AP Refresh and one piece of Poison Resistance.
---
WS on a private server.
---
I have a medic 50/15v pump I’m gonna try. See if that makes a big diff
---
I have sold Nuka Dark, Nukashine, Ballistic Bock &amp; high  voltage hefe all very well(cranberry moonshine &amp; a few of the of the others also sell well but are more of a hassle to make). For non craftables Nuka Quantums, Grapes &amp; Oranges all sell well but  mostly spawn in VERY few places. However, the king is Nuka Cranberry which has a few spawns &amp; if I am near max caps may spend up too 50 on.
---
As the colossal problem came out, I've noticed monogah is actually a nice spot to farm, or the raider camps around.
---
Other than that, Morgantown is the place to go, place will be filled with glowing ghouls after a nuke.
---
Yeah, your fire rate is much higher that mine
---
It'll probably be more expensive to proc the crits.
---
Since when does endurance on armor work?
---
And while you are at it, stop the math and go, do the field experiment.
---
The sub has a post for returning players in its menu.
---
Daft Punk's lawyers are going to enjoy this.
---
i do not think you can. it has limited modifications and no stocks so will always be pistol. if thats what they wanted for it i think they should have skinned it unique.
---
What menu ?
---
Herd can add up to +4 with strange in numbers and depending if you had any partial special points sitting there.
---
Either hop and hope to get it, or get the base plan and scrap the pistols.
---
In the header on the subs front page.
---
WOOD SCRAPS dam it I got that all screwed up wondered why he kept telling me to stop but hey I got a shit load of plans
---
My best selling beverage is rad ant lager. Sells commonly for me at 100 caps per.
---
Morgantown, White Spring and Harpers Ferry - all three give you quite a bit of different fluxes and spawns for ingredients.
---
Ah I see it now thanks
---
It’s the same as saying that guns kill people.
---
Well, there goes that gun. Thanks!
---
Naa, it’s not about mods, I’ve just made a new fixer at level 40 so don’t need my old one anymore
---
Weird. My suit has an invisible zipper that runs from pubic bone to coccyx. Maybe I just have more skillz at the armor bench.
---
The fissure site that is near the Pumpkin House, you can keep activing the ultracite nodes to generate waves of scorched there and walk away with quite a few materials - take a buddy with you for maximum payouts. Plus, there's generally a selection of other enemies in that area, possibly a scorchbeast, super mutatants, death claw, maybe even a sheepsquatch - if your nuke can encompass the random encounter spot nearest to Sons of Dane - and who knows, maybe you get One Violent Night to pop up during your nuke.
---
Surrounding area has a lot of cobalt and yellow flux, as well.
---
Must...have...all...the....mods...
---
Don't forget to wear a mask.
---
ACP, being an instanced interior, may have slightly different scaling, but I believe they will use the "recommended" level as the baseline for the scale. 
---
So, if you're level 50, you'll have a challenge, but should be able to contribute (and not insta-die). 
---
If you're level 20 or 30, yeah, you're still probably going to die, a lot.
---
It's a nice idea but I feel you won't make much caps in your venture, I used to sell the odd beverage at my camp and they never sold and they were available for months.
---
If you are going to do it I think it'll have to be niche items, maybe nuka dark, ballistic boc and your own nuka ( some people like to collect the various different ones for display) 
---
Anyway good luck in your venture
---
Meet a guy who has faster swing speed on his handmade, said it made it shoot crazy fast.
---
I got 4 or 5 and still use my handmade ,fixer,minigun.
---
Damn, you're right.
---
Most break in 5 minutes, Just OP repair kit killers
---
In my last few fights, the real heroes have been spending well over 3k ammo shooting at Earl, while the other 6 people have been collecting screws.
---
You are seriously lucky
---
Like using an auto fixer without gunsmith
---
Yeah I was planning to post a rant myself after a bad experience with one of these players.  To the dude who decided to "carry all the little dudes" last week: First of all,  no one is impressed that you can down Earl in seconds.  Second of all, please do not describe what you did to the SBQ, or anything really, using the phrase "f*ck her right in the p*ssy".
---
Seriously, how can people enjoy the game when they kill everything so quickly?
---
It uses a chunk of my limited stash space.
---
Wrong place friendo
---
Makes sense, you’re a Responder 😎👍🏼
---
I know what you mean even without legacies
---
it happens on EU for sure, i'v met afew.
---
they deliberately try to hide themselves so that they dont get reported or noticed, usually they will be wearing stealth suits, fat PA skins to cover the invisible handles of the .50 cal, etc.
---
if you know what to look for it becomes alot easier to know whos weapon is hacked.
---
Not terribly different. 
---
Im in your boat.  Started around wild Appalachia and didnt get a chance to get any legacies.  Around this recent fasnacht I was able to trade for a TSE Gatling Plasma however.
---
In general, since I only have the one, it's kind of like an 'oh shit' button that I can pull out in certain circumstances.  It also raises the caliber of event I can solo by allowing me to clear entire swathes of space.
---
That said, its spin up time makes it rough to use in true pvp (not a pvp person myself, but I've gotten my feet wet).  And its comparatively fragile when looked at alongside the rest of my arsenal. 
---
Lastly, you suddenly get a lot of people interested in trading with you.  They all want to try and buy it off you.
---
🤣🤣
---
Where were you during the 3 dupe wave? I got them for some irrelevant loot.
---
What u mean ?
---
Eh it’s not that great. Being op sucks. The fun now a days is trading said legacies and trying out new ones
---
it me
---
That sounds kinda kinky. Is it made of leather by any chance?
---
I thought workshops were so cool when I first started until level 200+ players would 1 hit me when I was level 10 and tell me I was shit 😂
---
Newsflash: all videogames have bugs.
---
Oh yeah, Using Gunsmith and Luck of the draw i get like a clip and a half for my flamer. Gatling plasmas/lasers aint so bad. I only ever had a TSE laser rifle but that thing broke after like 90 shots
---
And yet you will still miss most of your VATS shots....
---
No trades posts allowed
---
What's a 3 dupe wave?
---
As Cmdr Dugerre says ... “Why, just Why?”
---
Yes. It is also covered with studs and has a matching collar. Strictly functional.
---
buff every heavy explosive weapons durability while your at it.
---
had a grenade launcher, fired from 200% condition, 13 hits into a crowd and it broke.
---
from 13 hits, 200% condition.
---
They’re kind of just a meme in this game. There was an actual reason they were in some of the older games but they shouldn’t have ever been on the east coast. Now it’s just a code word for human meat
---
Oh lol u right wrong page
---
That's pretty common in my experiences with doing that event. I've only had it complete a few times correctly.
---
Nope hims just a dick.
---
Haha, looks like fun 😎
---
Fix all energy/explosive weapon durability!
---
Lol fair
---
I feel your pain https://youtu.be/RaTDPSovQ0k
---
Thats what the explosive vent mod is for.
---
I feel your pain. I agree that it's important to pick off the adds in a boss event, but it's sure not very satisfying to play a rifle build there.  I usually haul around an AA lever and an AA handmade for longer fights, in addition to my normal instigating lever gun.  And weapon weight reduction armor.
---
One other bit of advice: a good bit (but not all) of what people are calling damage mitigation in these boss fights is just range limitations.  I've had people swear up and down that the SBQ has extra mitigation when flying.  Maybe so?  But she's also at the edge of your gun's range.  You'll get more damage when she's flying right above you.
---
Same with Earl.  I don't know what it is about those mines, but the range is deceptive.  I feel like I have to stand under Earl and fire up his nose(s) to get full damage.  Keep using long barrels to keep your range up and get in closer than you normally would, and you should see higher damage numbers from that alone.
---
And recent finds the rug bleeds when you shoot it 😍
---
Whilst I hate cheaters, seeing these guns always makes me laugh, like mini guns with an experimental MIRV on the barrel XD
---
Is that a mod or a plan?  Need this strictly to complement the raider theme. 😏
---
Sometimes, some of the workshop events will drop up to three plans.
---
GET EM OUT BOYS WE DID IT
---
Are you on pc?
---
Now if only you could leave a Cryptic Note
---
I was just wondering about the ability for lower level players to be able to participate due to one wasteland. I didn't know if a lower level player could do the event if the bosses themselves scale or not. 
---
I knew certain areas would have level floors, i just wasn't sure of bosses/events.
---
I personally haven't failed, i just seen a bunch of low levels taking up spots of other players that could've been on our team who meaningful contributed and gotten the reward .
---
And you’re not that far from the laundry room either 🤣😎
---
At this point some of the best apparel combos involve clipping so I honestly don’t care about that anymore but I do understand your point
---
even with a team i can waste 3-6 ammo i have a plasma gat that with one of its legendaries heals me each hit so i can just tank him without interrupted fire. also have a explosive gat that i can waste 2-4k ammo
---
Agreed I got one left to get explosive cryo
---
What else are friends for? 🤣🤣
---
RadAnt Lager. That one is always in demand.
---
Morgantown seems to be the best , I hit it for the materials then I nuke whatever flux I need separately
---
They are being punished by not making 1500 caps.
---
Xbox sadly
---
Thanks 😎
---
Nothing wrong with enjoying the classics.
---
Lol... carbs are the devil in more ways than one.
---
There’s a PSN group that RP’s as the police force for the Responders, they go by the Five-0
---
Where am I gonna find a lobby like that?
---
I had to craft/scrap my way to getting the mod plans for Ultracite Laser. Just make sure you have your science perks loaded up when you scrap or lots of luck actually unlocking.
---
Lol definitely should have let him waste more ammo. Also i agree that people usually are nowhere to be found during keycard hunts, but today someone's bot flew through the Scorched Earth event so like 10+ people all got the keycard 😂
---
Once again, thanks to the gaming gods for blessing me with a copy of the game that works as it should.
---
Dam...I thought I was a nuke junkie but you are a pro you get my upvote now I'm going to go nuke that thanks
---
Ballistic Bock, Sweetwater's Special Blend... Rad Ant Lager is always nice to have on hand.
---
Do you still get The Treasury Notes for completing event?
---
That sucks would have tossed you a tse laser rifle
---
3 times where cheaters were going nuts duplicating all sort of rare items. Everything had the value of burnt bread.
---
I knew about level floors for open world i just didn't know if all events/bosses would scale or not.
---
I would prefer if under  level 50 players cannot enter the mine since we had a situation with low levels taking up spots from other players.
---
I have a quad explosive cryo..nothing to Wright home about.just sits in my stash
---
Ah I see
---
Glad his Speech is getting better 😎👍🏼
---
On Xbox unfortunately. The name I'm using right now is Responder Rangers.
---
Moleminers are people who made a choice: either live like a normal human being or live trapped forever in the suit because they bought Duchess' onlyfans
---
Currently they’ll spawn in accordance with the area of the map you’re in. For example: Forest: level 1-15. Mire: 20-40 ish. Sort of broad brushing that obviously, but you won’t find level 100 enemies in a workshop and each wave of enemies doesn’t get progressively harder.
---
However with One Wasteland dropping soon this is all going to change and enemies will spawn in accordance to your level.
---
I haven’t grabbed a Fusion Core in forever... are they fully charged?  I’m not in PA often, so if not I don’t want that weight.
---
You can get a legacy. Find some loot that people want.hell when acp 1st came out guys were trading legacy's for the Miner mask.not everyone was but the guys that have a stash full were.some trade for apparel.tatterd jacket,leather coat etc
---
Well then I can help you with some space management
---
Would a wrapped cap get me anything
---
I'd even settle for a nice wig. I had a great mod for Fallout 4 that gave me a chest full of gorgeous hair. I went around to every settlement spreading wigs. Preston had a wig of long jet-black braids. He looked hot.
---
I tried two days later and i was able to log in and play just fine for the past week. Not sure what changed.
---
Usually sitting on 50 to 100 of the other two.  Have to give it a try this weekend
---
I have a quad explosive and it does hit harder than a normal one but it's not something worth taking out of my stash for.really not missing out on much.its more of a oddity  for me
---
15 perception = 6% increased vats hit and 180 feet increased compass range
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Perception
---
Well, I happen to have one. A BE one.
---
My weapon isn't hacked and it doesn't oneshot tanks, but mowing down ghouls and supermutants makes me feel "haha shotty go boom" so i guess it's kinda the same feeling
---
Bravo! What a brilliant summary. I too am very intrigued by these mysterious folk. I’d never heard an explanation of their dialogue before but wow, that’s visceral!
---
I havent seen the plan.might be able to find a mod at vendors.i had to buy the ultracite plan from Phoenix bot in watoga or harpers ferry  and make then scrap to learn them.well worth laser pistols or laser rifles are kinda meh without explosive
---
I feel like it's dependent on your build and preference, really. I prefer PA, as to me it's not costly to repair as Im a junk hoarder anyway, cores are free, I've never paid a cap or flux for cores, just use power plants. No fall damage, more carry weight. And it looks badass, and way cooler than regular armors in my opinion.
---
Long story short, because it isn’t the math. END doesn’t work the way you’re describing as some END boosting items, such as armor, don’t boost hp. Even then, if your math was right, you’d be talking about someone who would have to constantly eat food and inject chems, only fight at night, drink a lot, etc. 
---
All MMO’s do this. Players willing to spend the time or money should be able to get short stat boosts, likewise players who don’t have a small playerbase that in most games would shell out a lot of money. It’s one way games balance their economies and contribute to endgame combat, especially pvp.
---
Whether Bethesda did that well is a whole other topic tho.
---
"Overseer, I'm trying to sneak into the Glassed Cavern, but I'm dummy thicc, and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting the scorched."
---
Logging off and logging back on fixes it for me, on the rare occasion it happens.
---
They better rebalance weight system, instead of adding more atom shop crap. I was talking about 400 extra weight for 1st you suggested
---
h o w d y
---
100% incorrect.
---
PRO TIP! Don't defend the workshop instead let it be taken. you then get a quest to retake it and there's only one wave of enemies rather than up to 4.
---
Well since it’s free if you don’t like what it collects you just don’t use it
---
I see nothing wrong with that; melee is riskier oftentimes; and gunslingers need some kind of a buff for their weapons that isnt "just make them rifles that weigh less", an DC the engine cant handle dual-wielding very well, so
---
Prickett’s Fort and Sylvie and Sons are your friends
---
'til your hearts content.
---
So I must wear a stupid looking outfit for a 17 year old kid who defended himself against domestic terrorists? I'm in!
---
Bear arms is definitely way better for heavies
---
Pemmican gives 7.5 extra HP with carnivore
---
Well I’m sure they wouldn’t mind if you used the name for a new character if you like it. You can also look up slang words for police. Some of them sound cool and that’s how some FO groups were named.
---
Ballistic, and I’ll give you 30c for a 6 pack.
---
You should be happy for Mag, her father finally rests in heaven.
---
Well fed + Rejuvenated?
---
I have an environmental sensor in my back yard, between my water purifiers. I always click it when i gather water, even though i get absolutely nothing from it. FOCD 76.  
---
And i try to get pie at the Rusty Pick every time i walk in.
---
IIRC on top of its raw DR; PA also has a flat % damage mitigation per armor piece equipped.
---
I mean, in the end it's still worthless compared to body armor where you can just stack legendaries until your a god smiting your enemies with impunity unfortuneately
---
I guess there is the rad resistance to a degree
---
It's just me trying to be funny. But there are prisoner collars at Eastern Regional Penitentiary that would fit that aesthetic.
---
Tried it a few times and always died super early to people camping. Teammates never come to revive or anything. Seemed like a waste of time to me, especially since I don't like battle royales to begin with. People just get a weapon, a few armor pieces and camp out.
---
You have a minstrel!
---
The tunnel under the purveyor doesn’t go anywhere, and pretty much all of this was just stolen off of widgeontvs video
---
I thought Giardia was something else. Dysentery has a few different causes, but usually if they know it's specifically Giardia causing the issues, they'll call it giardiasis.
---
Or adding a a loadout like any other mmo. A character in menu with slots of fill with your equip gear separate from the rest of your inventory
---
You should combine Rifle, shotgun, and pistol into a new word, that should make your character sound very badness.
---
Something like Rifishpist.
---
*chugs a bottle of vodka and bourbon*
---
Liver failure doesent exist in the apocalypse !
---
I haven’t seen anything official but I would guess maybe energy ammo? Since we have the raider bit for regular ammo? Maybe junk option too for things like fuses and circuits?
---
It happens when you play NW and then go to adventure without closing the game, just close it and log back on it fixes it
---
I believe it's connected to playing NW then going back to Adventure mode. Usually reloading the game fixes it for me though.
---
Trade all the way, you'd get one of those eventually.
---
Awesome stuff for full health builds.
---
"Simping" is supposed to mean what, exactly? 
---
It took you two full days to come up with "OMG! I'll use the same pathetic incel word but in the gerund because that's so much more meaningful!  I've got him now!!" lol
---
Are you seriously telling me that in retaliation to "simp" being such a meaningless, pathetic word as to be ridiculed is your 'powerful' response to the same word being used against you?
---
That is _so_ pathetic lol beta beta beta ))))  
---
"simping" haha I gotta tell me friends about this one-- you won't know who's serious or trolling by the end of it !!!   
---
so pathetic ))))))))))))))))
---
Edit: I upvoted you, BTW. Think of it as a 'participation trophy'.
---
Its never worth going if it's underpopulated in my experience. Always get stuck with people who can't do damage or only focus on the small wendigos and we run out of time. Save your ammo if you think you guys wont be able to handle it, cause when time runs out you just fail and get booted from the mine.
---
Justice
---
I'm guessing it just collects cloth. You needed to donate millions of cloth to unlock it, so here's your cloth back. Enjoy.
---
Do you want to lighten up your inventory?
---
War bonds.
---
Conversely, people that ignore downed players are also the people that one-shot legendaries in group events. They probably leave their shopping carts in the middle of the parking lot, too.
---
That wrapped cap .honestly I'm not sure.to that guy that needs it to complete his outfit of course it will get you something nice.enough for a legacy it's up to the trader.search up the 76 trade sub.cant name it here though .but it's odd what folks will trade for at times
---
Steel, Cork, Wood, Cloth...
---
I got feared into the drill one time and was afraid as I ran towards it and died laughing when it actually killed me lmao it's a nice touch
---
Honestly this whole sub has a super toxic vibe: I see people asking questions or stating things similar to this post or complaining about people who over take events and their post is 5m old with 2 downvotes already.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!
---
I have 2 legacies on each of my toons. Still I just don’t use them.
---
Hmmmm well guess what im doing tonight
---
You had me at Circuits.. a man can only dream of having to not farm telephones anymore.
---
I got a BE gatling plasma in stash and still use bffr cal50 and LMG, or b2525 fixer. I played with explosive weapons for more than 1000 hours and now I find them annoying as fck, at the point I would be happy if they were not in the game anymore especially legacy with splitter (and the teslas too)
---
I know there is an inventory steal glitch where you spam request until you get lag and it will just move over to the other person’s inventory. That’s real. Haven’t heard of this one.
---
It’s not. I have similar weapons and it isn’t the same feeling.
---
Hounds wouldn't be scorched either then, they'd also be immune
---
Thanks! Makes sense, I’ve started doing a lot of NW recently in the last week so that’s probably it.
---
I don’t understand what you’re asking, sorry. I’ll try, but if I’m not answering what you intended to ask, lmk. By legwork I’m referring to the physical, as opposed to mental (like codebreaking), aspect of launching. I’m talking about the work you do from the point at which you enter a solo to the point at which you’re inserting the keycard/code. My point was that they’ve done a great job of making it so that you can cheat and grab the weekly codes if you choose, but doing so is not enough, that you still have to spend half an hour getting to the keypad. They’ve made it tedious enough that nukes aren’t detonating every 5 minutes, but not so tedious that no one does it.
---
If you're getting 5 fps on ACP, look for the guy using a tesla on the wendigos. Something about that gun makes latency get really bad as the kill counts go up. Same with other events.
---
I want to play the spoons.
---
If you are in PC I highly recommend the mod Save Everything. It prevents you from dropping, scrapping or selling anything that you’ve favorited (it actually greys out the option)
---
[Save Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148/)
---
This is a good PSA for all new players.
---
This is definitely the best use of my bloodied stealth (lever action) rifleman build, which really does negligible harm to Earle, especially on a DPS basis. Can one-shot most of the spawn via VATS, two shots if my adrenaline charge isn't active. I don't even really do it for the screws. I scamper around to collect some, but I really don't need them. I am hit or miss with reviving people - try to do it, but being bloodied and this fragile, trying to help some people is a death sentence for me. If I can revive them before I die, it's OK, they can revive me - but if I die first, then the team is down two instead of one.
---
As an aside, I had my first non-Earle Colossus experience a couple of days ago. Someone nuked the Fissure site prime, but no one(!) showed up for Scorched Earth. So I headed over to the Sundew Grove in the hopes of getting some of those sweet High Radiation Fluids. When I get there, it's a Colossus. Eventually a few other people showed up and we took him down. Worst part: neither the Colossus nor the spawns dropped any stable flux components. Not even a hardened mass. Disappointingly poor return on the time involved in the fight. Oh I did get a three star legendary I guess - a Hunter's knife with blocking and something else useless. Cue sad trombone sound effect.
---
Or if you join an event that event should automatically be turned on rather than having to either wait for the little diamond to appear on the map or hunt it down in your pipboy. Especially if there are timers.
---
This is no stalker outfit. It lacks significant cheeki breeki.
---
I had the same bug and I did the right order, just join a new server and try again. I had to leave my world and join a new one and it worked, didn't require a game restart like people are saying but that's just me.
---
I'd rather live with my collection who spouts communism rather then live with yours who'd most likely have me dead on a matter of hours
---
No. Bethesda took those away months ago.
---
Finally rolled two acrobats pieces last night. And yer damn right the first thing I did was a flying leap off the monorail elevator.
---
I’m aware but is there something in between seasons  to motivate logging in and playing ?
---
Platform would be helpful.
---
I saw one last night a minigun that shoots orbital strikes the server almost went down because of it. I'm glad the person had a bit of common sense and it stopped.
---
Theres a clean version datamined about 12 months ago
---
Xbox one. Sorry.
---
No clue. Nothing has been announced yet.
---
Bethesda needs to buff a LOT of stuff. Pistols, lasers, Black powder weapons, the broadsider, but no they just want to release new guns that you have to go through a 8 week grind to be able to touch.
---
LoL.i kinda  want to trade for something I'm on xbox the last clown I traded with got the better of me.found out after i checked his profile it was only 2 weeks old with good karma
---
Even if Bethesda has the ability to detect them, their system is broken at the core, and hacked weapons will continue to exist because of said broken game engine.
---
I haven’t heard of this until today so it kind of made me nervous. I just wanted to ask the community on here to see what people know about it. Reddit seems more accurate than Facebook when it comes to these types of things.
---
I do wendigo, then queen, queen every day and I get a total of 2 queens and 3 wendigos. I do it in a private server and solo or with a couple friends so their resistances are low. I always kill the queen before the wendigos when I launch on her.
---
A recently went from a hybrid melee gunner to hard line guns or melee, made it to 250 on the 3 level 1 weapon cards for 30% buff rather than 3 level 3 for 60%
---
What do you think of The Blue Line? Also any suggestions for my build? Thanks.
---
Theyre buggy as fuck and ruin everyones fps. I really wish bethesda could just whipe them from the game.
---
This is one of the many reasons I prefer the Scorchbeast Queen, doesn't glitch out of map, you always end up with enough people to get it done, people usually don't go there just to kill the other scorched. People love to let Colossal Problem time out and waste time and ammo on failing an event, never had it happen for me at the Scorchbeast Queen though.
---
The game?  If you’re not enjoying it, don’t play.  There is no bonus content once you finish the season.
---
Checkout Organ trail: Directors Cut on the app store
---
I can't say I've seen handmade but I do see an awful lot of scatter .50 cal MGs, its completely out of control. I'll join a nuke at ACP/SBQ and there's always one, I'll go to trade with someone and what do I see in their inventory? Of course a scatter .50cal. Bethesda really need to crack down on these hacked items.
---
That's what you get, filthy Brotherhood scum.
---
That’s been going on for a while, it’s a server bug, the damage output on a weapon, is not registering properly with the server. Hopping servers usually fixes the issue.
---
Or just get rid of durability being removed per hit instead of per shot.
---
Whenever you hear this stuff tell them to prove it. Most of the time they can’t. They’re just spreading hearsay.
---
That's what I'll be replacing white knight with for the event! Been trying to think of a way to up my damage in power armor more.
---
freedom, justice, and the souls of the damned.
---
Dam it always the brides maid never the bride.  I'm on pc well that just sucks
---
I'd rock that 100% ha ha My fav atm is the new T65
---
Mining ultracite ore in the blast zone. Some ores will have a chance to mutate into ultracite ore. My favourite spot is at the house east of the Overgrown Sundew groove. If you mine them, a wave of scorched will spawn nearby. Scorched mostly drop high rads fluids.
---
The ore sometimes glitched, so you can just spam the mine button.
---
But can he harvest *you* for bone shards?
---
Its a port from cc but they retexture to higher resolution and a darker paint
---
Wrong sub and no chance.
---
The 10 perks image was fake. 5 Star is possible but Beth at one time went through and purged all the 5 Star items that and been hacked in.
---
[It's just a bicep](https://i.imgur.com/H8zgwfM.jpg)
---
True
---
I mean that's kinda of a trash answer since the only appealing thing about the title other than rewards is playing with friends. Bethesda already knows the game doesn't offer much that's why there will be a new season up before the end of the month.
---
My first award thank you now I really feel like shit were on different system.  There is plenty of groups where you can find a legacy imo I would go for a laser rifle it's the one gun I never part with but that's just me
---
A request for a couple flux might be one of the few I'd consider.  If someone is begging for common materials or ammo or whatever, they should just go out and get it or try another weapon.
---
Flux is tricky for a new player though, until you get pretty deep into the game it's not even clear how to get it.
---
Should be able to stash and store pets once you tame them, just like the allies work.
---
That’s why I carry a magic weapon with me.  If that happens.  I take on earl myself.  Still takes a while.  And usually I need to be respawned a few times.  But I can get it done that way while others go screw hunting.
---
Sounds good, assuming the textures load in
---
Thank you for the info.
---
I believe season 2 starts right away once season 1 ends.
---
Gun fu adds 30% damage on 3rd target + in VATS. If you can get 2 windegos than Earle it helps a lot
---
Just look up fallout 76 hellfire and you'll find it
---
I got one THIRD try a week or two ago.
---
Before that I had to bump up luck a ton and drink liquor and hit activate over and over and over.
---
I guess it’s not a big deal unless you’re selling pretty large items.  Just baffles me there is a tax at all... on in-game currency LOL. I mean, who is even collecting it or where does it go....
---
Whyyyy did I have to read such a concoction of a sentence? 😂😂😂🤮
---
I think it should be really hard to get, the people who have grinded the original hellfire will understand why. After investing all of those hours I don’t want to see hellfire armor everywhere.
---
Did the same thing, then went to the logger camp that isn't too far with woodchucker on.
---
No one who has a legacy got it on their own. 99% of every "legacy" you see resulted from duping.
---
It's why they just need to be removed.
---
There are bots that auto downvote every post in this sub.
---
I'll need to cut my food carry, and swap in a gun Fu or 2, thru hiker is honestly my bane and crutch.
---
Honestly, doing a full sweep of the game to remove weapons, armor, and power armor with impossible modifications/legendary effects would help improve the overall experience for PC.
---
I believe it will collect speculation and conjecture.
---
Same here. I think I see maybe one a month.
---
Haven't heard of anyone having this problem except for people who possibly have glitched their camp budget.
---
Do you have a backpack mod? There is a backpack mod that is the same thing as thru hiker (cant stack so great replacement)
---
 I'm just happy knowing you'll never look at Earle the same way again!
---
Yah... tax on in-game currency that goes to nobody.  Doesn’t benefit anyone just gouges everyone.  It’s strange.
---
except when alcohol is one of your addictions.
---
I do those "drink a ton of liquor" events last thing in the day all at once.
---
I don’t even cheat but I don’t mind having a guy take a quick chunk out of the queen or colossus. Saves me bullets/farm time  and I’m way past bored of the queen. It’s the overzealous one to ten second kills that are a bit much. Yeah you got me, you wasted two minutes of my time and are super cool guy troll supreme.   
---
The sad part is how they get it. 
---
1.somebody buys it on eBay. This is why some of the good ones are rare. It retains eBay value and they don’t allow your basic cheater to get it without buying it themselves. If they find out you bought it and distributed it they will let you out of the loop of the current dupe. That’s what keeps a market.
---
2. Their friend is a cheater and they got one but can’t keep a secret.not a norm as most duper’s keep the good stuff under lock and key. So if the items spread odds are it’s not the current hot item in the first place.

3. They are somebody’s  sweatshop slave that trades/dupes on discord like it’s their day job. You do that until you get in good graces with the Narcissist that made the item or one of his minions. It’s  pathetic to have to jump through hoops for a treat. But in general it’s a young  network of teenagers  so it feels more important to them. A few are older and its predatorily creepy for an inflated internet ego.

Been a while since I've seen a one-shot on anything. Are you on PC?
---
Chemist (junkie build) and then traveling pharmacy eats 3 points the second I step into power armor lol
---
It's there to remove caps from the game. It helps keep the economy from inflating.
---
Now? It's been like this for almost a year.
---
Not bad! Only thing is I don’t have a private server so hopefully it works.
---
 So nuke the WC first and kill Earle.
---
2nd nuke to SBQ kill her then fast travel to ACP and kill him. 
---
3rd nuke drops on SBQ again?

All the radiation means our guts are basically a puddle of goo straight from lips to butthole. It's a mess in there. Takes a lot more food and water to get any useful nutrition out of it.

/headcanon

I buy every ballistic boc I can find.
---
it's always a quick bump in score.
---
Happy cake day!
---
A lot of people are still sharing old information...it's easy not to know that it's out of date.
---
I haven't heard of anyone having vendor problems in a while now.
---
Been playing since Day 1, never seen a boss one-shotted.
---
That’s what the Melee scrubs like me are here for.
---
Technical plans &amp; high tech weapons...which it hordes &amp; won't give to you.
---
Fuck, I didn't realize I was playing wrong.
---
Yup
---
All negative effects of starving and dehydration are being removed but as for when Bethesda wasn’t too clear on it.
---
Why on earth would you buy the ranks as soon as you got the atom rewards? As you might know, the amount of score needed to rank up gets higher by each rank, you could have finished way earlier if you had bought the ranks after rank 90.
---
Do both - you can nuke ACP, fight &amp; kill him. Then drop a nuke on the Queen, ACP will pop again, go kill him (again) then go back and kill the Queen too.
---
Then they need to remove or raise the cap limit.
---
To quote an ancient proverb "Pics or it didn't happen"

This is the sort of rigorous scholarship that brings me joy. Am I afraid Beth won't do anything cool with Mole Miners? Of course I am. Do I live in hope that all these puzzle pieces will come together and bump the MM up into the top echelon of Fallout creations? God yes.
---
Yea someone posted a theory saying that each time when a projectile hits something, the weapon degrades. I think it makes sense. The lasers’ many beams all explode and the splash damage all count towards the weapon condition. No wonder two-shot explosives die faster than their targets. In fact my very first legacy was a tse laser, looted off a fat ghoul in WS, used it to kill a super mutant, the darn thing broke immediately. I was shocked and sold it to a vendor bot lol
---
yeah you can't really solo that thing without using a glitchy "magic" build. If there aren't more than four or five people going in I normally write it off.
---
I don’t like how the devs tend to gloss-over and be inconsistent about how radiation affects things in the Fallout universe, but the idea that mole miners get fused into their suits by radiation is a little better. Technically it would result from the blast and heat effects of a nuclear detonation, and WV didn’t take a direct hit, but still it’s a decent premise.
---
I just did. Back to back queen earl imposter. They all died within 3 seconds once people started shooting. I was lucky enough to kill the imposter but was not so fortunate on other bosses
---
Maybe. Im on xbox and its always fun
---
You're right where I am. The fact that anything new for them exists on the PTS (granted, in an interior we can't access yet that was added back in April on their internal build, according to the version control on it) gave me some hope they've got a plan to go *somewhere* with them.
---
What I have never seen or heard of, that doth not exist.
---
Right?
---
Totally agree it was fantastic content
---
It's okay. I wore my brown pants today.
---
Truth i agree with the build area limitation but we for sure need a way to up our build budget, whether it be granted by leveling up alone, or maybe as a INT/PER perk
---
You mean by giving it to you? Cuz no. But id be happy to trade
---
There has been announcements. We're getting another season with the whole board already being shown. We're also getting raids again.
---
My friend got giardia in Minnesota because he drank a water bottle that was still purifying while half asleep.
---
Hilarious XDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
It’s a 2-3 week gap.  10 week season 2-3 weeks to restart makes 48 to 52 week cycle.
---
If you’re on PS4 I’d buy a boatload of ballistic and high voltage hefe
---
Yes!
---
Once a day, I might add.
---
You are buried alive and the game ends. 
---
Lol. No, just kidding. It spawns u outside of the mine, I make sure I am close to it and the rewards pop up. I still have my junk too.
---
Whiskey + party boy 3 = +6 str
---
That is so true
---
S.C.O.R.E. doesnt stand for anything other than Bethesda thinks all Fallout things need an acronym lol
---
Before the get removed I just want to try one
---
I should start doing that, but sleep in a bed.
---
That was my original comment in the thread. Amongst several other people. But nobody has been able to produce as far as I can tell. And the guy who posted said his friend got taken. I’m willing to bet he just lost his stuff somehow. Dropped it. Put it in the vendor or script it. Who knows. Just looking for anyone who can validate.
---
Ok, thank you. Trying to figure this all out coming back. 
---
I just made assumptions before, but don’t want to waste gold anymore buying armor that does nothing for me.
---
It's their way of telling you they actually don't want you as an ally and hanging out there.
---
"Uh oh, here comes that asshole Gatt guy.  All he does is stop by and drop his junk on the ground in a paper bag before accosting Ward for work.  Quick get out the instruments!"
---
But it sorta kinda is the only answer, whether you deem it trash or not ... Running events, camp building, the usual array of daily quests, dropping nukes *is* the end game right now. That’s what we have to do while we wait for the next big DLC. Seasons just mask the staleness by offering rewards for doing the same things over and over again. There were planned breaks between seasons. So really, this is the game’s service model: expansion DLC, season, break, season, special events like Meat Week, and eventually the next DLC expansion. At the end of it all, atoms and cosmetics will only satisfy to a point, and it does come down to whether you enjoy the game enough to keep playing. Just because it’s the answer you don’t want to hear doesn’t make it trash.
---
Right. That’s what I said. But there’s always excuses as to why they can’t produce proof. Fake news.
---
Was actually just wondering last night why i had picked up pumpkins and wasnt able to replant them lol
---
I have yet to see a one-shot boss.  I was at acp last night and we didn’t even make a dent....
---
That’s a very thorough and well thought out post. I applaud and commend the effort it took. I used to wonder about the mole miners myself. Unfortunately the more I played the game, the more I realized Fallout 76 has nothing to do with any previous lore. Someone on this forum called fallout 76 the Fallout Amusement Park and I think that’s the perfect analogy. So now instead of trying to wrap my head around all the established lore that’s been bent or broken, or being completely annoyed because the brotherhood is coming all the way from California 25 years after the bombs fell when according to VERY established lore they were little more than a somewhat organized group of military survivors at this point, I just play the game. Since this is probably the last Fallout game we’ll ever get, I’m going to enjoy it as much as I can.
---
Don't get why there's a log door, but not log walls...
---
You can do that that.  I have a SS zealots machete w/ the sacrificial blade mod.
---
Keep thinking that ACP should reward repair kits just as the SBQ.
---
Everytime i tried to fast travel to someone in there it puts me outside.
---
You can use these guns openly all day and not get banned. 95% of the banned accounts are accounts that have been caught using hacks or duped in a notable excess. The other five are straight up arbitrary when their algorithm fails them. Which probably hurts those people more than the guy with five burner accounts they bought at a bulk discount just for this occasion. When it started I think some people got nicked for having legendary rings and other oddities. But at this point everyone’s dirty and they don’t want to lose 15 grand a month in fallout first money. Probably why they unbanned half the duper accounts last round. People used their main accounts and most of those got reinstated.
---
yes it is still going on
---
Lord almighty guess im waitin
---
So many easy QoL improvements that should had to be already in Fallout 4...
---
Thanks so much for the quick response!
---
\[agrees with you in piano and mouth harp\]
---
That doesn't change that a lot of the time going to ACP is a massive waste of time and resources
---
It's up to three guaranteed 3-star legendaries - with the right build, it doesn't take long at all.
---
So how exactly do people even do this shit? Even with magic damage i dont do enough to kill earle in a few seconds. I can kill the sbq and assaultron kinda fast but not near as fast as some other people.
---
Same but everywhere really.
---
Saw it couple hours ago
---
So essentially, the game is trash.
---
I got downvoted to shit last year asking for this but I wholeheartedly agree. 
---
It would be nice if you could swap out emotes with poses. 
---
Sparklers on the fly ftw
---
yeah looking under the correct category - Perception and scrolling all the way left &amp; right.
---
I think I had to unlock them earlier, but I was focussed on a shotgun/rifle build so didn't take them.
---
If I am somehow missing them and they are there, that is good news as like everyone I have a reasonable fixer to use.
---
Thanks for the helpful replies.
---
I'm not a PvP person, but the Legendary Race score points challenges had me logging in a few timed.  I made it more of a stealth challenge game, seeing how long I could survive just by sneaking from bush to bush.  It was actually kinda fun.  Made it to last 3 once - usually top 10.
---
Yeah - I know, probably doesn't help with what you're feeling....
---
That would explain why we all still float then, yes.
---
It freezes you in place. 
---
It wouldn’t add anything that doesn’t already exist with photomode so please stop charging excessive overtime here mr fun police ;)
---
Did it last night
---
I think the consoleros have an advantage in this issue due to less hacker issues.  I play for almost a year now and havent seen this Happening a Single time.
---
Although i can Imagine that its possible on PC, i mean i read alota stuff about hacked level 50 handmades with invisible beam splitters and stuff.
---
I feel sorry for PC players but thats the risk of having more options and possibilities in General.

It is crazy good in VATs. However currently VATs seems to be a little screwed up. Can one shot a lot of enemies even in non VATs too, but not like before. Agree that it works a little weak sometimes, even on low levels, when not in VATs.

Don’t you have to manually start this one by activating the terminal?
---
That sounds more like the depressed robot from Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.
---
Something isn’t right. It doesn’t matter when you unlock them. Post a screen shot the next time you level up.
---
We used to be able to catapault ourselves there and in CAMPS
---
it was a glorious era🕊 but bethesda clipped our wings
---
I shouldn't have to make a build that can solo Earle to do his event. I can do damage to him and with a team we can get the job done. Instead everyone goes there to farm screws. And I already am overloaded with legendaries because the scrip limit doesn't let me offload them more than a few a day, the last thing I need is even more taking up my stash space. Scorchbeast Queen is much better in my opinion. Doing both also doesn't stop Earle from glitching out of the map, once again making it a waste of time and resources.

What did you think the explosive vents were for?

Year 2021 you log on to the game and find a new quest from the Brotherhood of Steel in ATLAS. Talking to the Paladin, you were inform that the brotherhood has detected a sudden large seismic activity happening from Ash Heap to the Salvage Divide.
---
Scouts come in with news sighting hundreds of mole miners suddenly migrated away from Ash Heap, scattered mostly to Salvage Divide, and from the looks of it they are running away from something.
---
While trying to inspect the weird activities you were informed by Mobius that unrecognized life forms are detected in Ash Heap. And you are send by the brotherhood along with a dispatch team to investigate the mining sites. 
---
On your run through you found various tunnels leading deep into the earth, inconsistent seismic activities happening while you explore deeper. As you think you’re about to hit a dead end, the tunnel comes to an opening deep into the underground. Within it, you spot numerous familiar but unknown large creatures, head shaped like a vulture, body long and slim, featherless yet covered with crystalized skin. Amongst them a particularly large one stands out, when your try your VATS their name revealed: SCORCHBEAST KING.
---
THE PLAGUE HAS EVOLVED.
---
No, it will pop up on the map.  Then you have 15(?) minutes to get there and start the computer.   You can't just activate the terminal whenever you like.
---
Widgeon TV did a similar video on the topic of mole miners if anyone’s interested
---
https://youtu.be/GxWgnoRjZxQ
---
As all other responses have stated, first pellet but to add it's all pellets that hit at the same time as that pellet. VATS hits all pellets at once so highly recommend using VATS
---
Edit: also VATS crits apply to all pellets so you trigger 8 crits at once with the instigating effect (if you ever need to overkill a mole rat)

I wanna do this event so much, but I'm like level 30 and will get absolutely pummeled by all those wendigos for sure.
---
Two would be nice like it was when first sold.
---
Reason why I finally started reading Reddit. I typically avoid PvP anyway, but I'm also concerned that the intruder will have a better build and weapons than I do. Basically, it still comes down to a don't really care enough to get into PvP over a workshop.
---
Yeah lol Vault 76 was the brightest and best of the world and is apparently supposed to rebuild the country, and all you can build is a tiny camp and workshops that you constantly lose from crashing lol. Was definitely a major disappointment with how hyped it is in the beginning with the vault supposedly housing he last hope for america and us being the rebuilders and building is so limited when you actually do it
---
Why would they do that? The more score people lose, more likely it is that they will buy the ranks with atoms. I'm 93.6% sure that fixing the score challenge auto complete bug is last on their priority list. 
---
And customer service has had the ability to give atoms since launch of the game, they could have given us atoms to compensate the loss of score (for us to be able to buy the ranks lost) but they choose not to. They want your money dude.
---
Lol me too.
---
I never knew why I kept picking up phones....learn something new every day.
---
You know... maybe scrip is used to make some of their masks and filters. It would explain why the purveyor values it over legendary weapons.
---
So did I. I would make a little altar for it in my CAMP like the lobotomites did in their cave.
---
Bold statement
---
Its pretty good armor.  At L238, its is still my goto.
---
For the overencumbered, the additional carry weight is A huge help, that it does the job is another, and with 200% repair, is quite durable.
---
I once found a wendingo colossus overgrown sundew and killed wendingo spawns for as long as I could.   300+ of screws later, I was a happy man
---
Right now, I'm looking at the Season 2 web page, and it has the new **descriptions**, but the old **images**. So it says Rank 4 is a "Military Foot Locker Stash Box", but the picture is of the sink. 
---
They can't even get their website together. I would be shocked if score-granting tools have been created.
---
Makes me wonder what you've been doing up to this point...
---
 kids downvoted you.
---
More Mole Miner lore! They're 76's coolest addition imo. So mysterious, &amp; seemingly intelligent. My hope is that they are developed into something resembling the Super Mutants on the West Coast.
---
These two groups are really unique in the Fallout canon, in that they're radically different from baseline humans, unlike ghouls, &amp; so the societies they form &amp; the ways they survive the wasteland can be really fantastical &amp; imaginative.
---
There's that loading screen tip that says the fires beneath the Ash Heap continue to rage "for some unknown reason", which I've always imagined to be the fires of Moleman industry, a subterranean city down there somewhere.
---
Also, I never got to explore the Rusty Pick pre-Purveyor, has that jury-rigged monster truck out front always been there? Or is that hers?
---
I think the biggest mystery of fallout 76 is why was it released in such a desolate state and why is it still in such a desolate state 2 years later
---
The struggle is real lol.
---
Make it, loot it when you see it, and use melee weapons when practical
---
Interesting. I run carnivore but I could still get +4. And it stacks with alcohol and chems?
---
What do you mean?
---
Well said. Would give an award if I could afford it. I’m 17 and I’m glad I’m not like that.
---
High Voltage Hefe and Ballistic Bock sell like hotcakes.
---
Oh, I missed the announcement of what the daily challenges will be in between seasons. What will they be?
---
I want that bug back. Reminded me of I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.

Since the glitch has never gone away, do you wait to log in every day?

I’d love to have the hunger rate decreased

**I see you aligned with the Raiders eh?**

There is a basement with a lil open-secret connected to it too.

---
Expulsion notice
---
2 of my characters only use legacies for their builds, but I have dozens total. Most of them sit unused on a mule or on display.
---
Consider a Shotgun build. I can do 300 with an explosive shotgun and almost 600 with a Gauss shotgun.
---
Other than boss battles requiring nukes, there aren't any public events that can be started manually any more.
---
Just a heads up this is actually fixed in the PTS so it is coming. We just gotta wait until one wasteland drops for everyone to have the fix.
---
Oh no im usually asleep when it changes but i flipped my sleep schedule so now it's something i have to worry about
---
I enjoy the bass :)
---
Don’t stand behind a hoof you don’t want to get kicked by is a life lesson I learned early on
---
For some weapons yes. ultracite plasma cartridges come in large quantities. I run plasma caster and make 1000 cartridges with like 5 flux. Usually lasts me quite a while.
---
Well, i have no free camp budget. They add so much stuff. We really need bigger camp budget and stash space.
---
I’m on PS4 and it feels like all the events are stuck waiting until a nuke drops. Line in the sand dropped twice while people were nuking earl and SBQ.
---
Untrue. I legitimately spawn hacked my BE25 alien blaster
---
L238, in the forest between Monongah plant and Bolton greens. 
---
 Central on the map (which is great when overencumbered - faster to get from there to (whereever)
---
Didn’t want to spend my relax at camp time fighting high level enemies, or having camp destroyed by same while I was away.
---
The acid node is the other reason :)
---
Quantums, grapes and cherries
---
I am interested as well. Usually just throw my legendaries in vendor for the price it states on their site and they all sell quickly.
---
Gotcha. Yep, it's still a thing
---
This isn't the sort of thing that should even need to be reported, if Bethesda cared at all they'd detect these weapons automatically and remove them.
---
If you want to stick with rifleman and are having trouble with tankier enemies, I would suggest getting a plasma gun with flamer mod.  Plasma flamers use rifleman perks and they shred.  May take some time to get used to fighting up close with it, but you won't have to worry about changing perks at least.
---
Seen boss on PC one shotted or very close to it a few times.  Very frustrating. 
---
 It happened to me yesterday in a completely different game after I waited like 20 minutes for something to appear.  Had to wait another 20 😔
---
Can you share with the class your math and statistical receipts that got you to 93.6%?
---
no u

Season 1 ends September 8. Season 2 starts September 15.

Unfortunately. So now I'm just sitting here with 40 minutes
---
My Gunslinger toon is basically all pink.
---
It’s not a question of market, it’s a question of Bethesda having the ability and resources. Right now they’re focused on Starfield and Elder Scrills 6. That will probably use up the next 3-5 years of development time. The bigger issue is Todd Howard. He’s 50. He’s also been the driving force behind Bethesda purchasing and developing the Fallout franchise. When he retires, that drive is gone. That’s why I think Fallout 76 will be the last Fallout game. They’ll keep updating it and adding content, but I don’t think there will be a Fallout 5. I hope I’m wrong. I really do.
---
:D
---
Fun fact! The Purveyor has a network of tubes in the Rusty Pick, one of which runs from the scrip machine to her counter.
---
Riding Shotgun
---
I love it when people I attack say something like “haha ur wasting ammo griefer”. OHH NO NOT MY 100k+ 5.56 oh the horror!
---
Willing to bet the ghillie items were part of that too. 
---
It would help if it wasn’t such a absolute chore grind to level up in NW. 
---
At this point it only makes sense to play when it’s 2xp and your not getting slapped in the face for time spent.
---
Wow, thanks! Appreciate it.
---
Nope. Keep it out of F1st. 
---
I have F1st and I don’t even want it in that.
---
Oh PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a sticky of your comment on the sub front page so people will shut up about this already.
---
Thank you so much! Ill snag the LAR plans today, still dont have them. Appreciate it! Ill be sure to message ya if I have any pressing issues 😁
---
Teslas are destroying my fps. Mine are in stash box.
---
sell ballistic bock, high voltage here, and all Nuka cola types
---
I would argue waiting times have nothing to do with it. 
---
people don’t play it because it’s a absolute heartless grind unless you have a squad or cheat.
---
I’ve seen one only in a single day where the imposter was one shot, the Queen, and her two sisters were dead in less than two minutes after the nuke dropped. A quartet of level 600+ on PS4 with legacy weapons and insane builds. Beyond that it’s a usual twenty minute bullet sponge kind of game for me where more often than not we fail events if we don’t get a full server in on the action or a good mix of weapons on earl.
---
Thanks for the detailed tips! Appreciate it. Maybe ill make another character in the future thats a commando so i can see what thats like. Im sure ill make another one in the future.
---
That is excellent news!
---
Nothing much related to the mole miners but I think of them as the group that actually knows most of the secret of Appalachia. The scorchbeast lairs, the mysterious interloper, Earle’s tragedy, most of the vaults, etc etc. Most of them most likely seen and encounter those things waaay before us and survived them but are unwilling to share the information with the survivors.
---
Vampires Vanguards Heavy/AR build here. No one dies on my watch. I will not die. Always finish the event in 15mins or less. I do go through 30-50 stimpacks saving players though lol
---
I don't think so. Unless someone started one recently.
---
Depends on the weapon.
---
There are some weapons that are purely hacks.  These are things like explosive .50 cals with Beam Splitters on them - the ones that garble the game's audio when they are used.
---
These are other weapons that are "magic," but circumstantially.  They generally require you to have certain Legendary attributes, target the same body part, and hammer on it fast enough to trigger a kind of "damage overflow" glitch.  You can always tell this by how the boss's health bar depletes in a staggered, but exponential fashion.
---
Not a public event. 
---
Campfire Tales, Uranium Fever, etc. Those are Public Events.
---
look here, if I take a four nap during a 8 hour shift &amp; go home 2 hours early it's only fair that I get 5 hours of overtime pay.
---
If you could  use the laying down pose in the bushes/clipping into something without being in photomode i could see getting up to kill someone faster possible.
---
Took me a year of playing every 2xp and every NW rewards sprint to hit 90 and it’s stretching out like the beach scene from jaws
---
Yep, had the black &amp; orange smoke... was pretty cool
---
This is what makes it all worth it.
---
Just report them to Bethesda using the in-game reporting feature.
---
I’m still trying to figure out how all of these randoms are getting their hands on this shit. I would expect it from the members of one of the raider clans, but I quite often see foodbuilds with these weapons.
---
Die.
---
Legit Explosives Handmade makes the same sound tho
---
Great breakdown! The presence of mole miners in the northern Savage Divide is weird, now that you've got me thinking about it. There is a spawn and maybe tunnel opening just north of the Sunnytop ski lodge, too.
---
Can anyone tell me when the legendary mole miners will return... thx in advance
---
Well im on xbox so idk if hacked weapons are a thing, but i have a magic gatling laser and a magic lmg and still cant get rid of the bosses like some guys do
---
It goes away when another player kills you.
---
remove cloths and armor, stash your junk and run around. 
---
Someone will oblige.
---
you must be killed by another player, and they claim your bounty. best option is to remove all armor and go to vault 76, bend over, and wait
---
Did you afk overnight? 
---
Be honest here
---
So, like, im fucked no matter what (i lose caps)?
---
I'd say it's become a full-blown epidemic on PC where, for the past month, I've had more boss battles than not end this way.  It has become a pleasant surprise when they *don't*.
---
It's especially bad since we're getting this damage nerf, but Bethesda has yet to address these hacked weapons and exploits at all, which is just further punishment for the players who fight legit.
---
Probably. But we don’t know for sure.
---
No exact date but given they've had some updates on the PTS likely some time in September or October.
---
Sure, Todd might've been the driving force behind reviving &amp; developing the IP, but it's beyond massive now. They're developing a Netflix show for christsake. One day they might lose any sense of a coherent vision, &amp; drive it into the ground like EA did with Mass Effect, but there's waay too much money to be made for Zenimax to think about shelving the IP.
---
I'm a full health stealth rifleman/commando (usually run commando for Earl) and I \*love\* keeping the room clear and reviving people. Folks with heavy weapons can sit there and do massive damage while I backflip around the room headshotting wendigos. I also give away the ammo heavies need at my camp as a sign of support. I could \*probably\* take Earl down myself, but I think just shooting him is terribly boring, so this is the part I play.
---
This is one of the main things that's been fixed by the new damage system from what I've heard.
---
Ditto my f(r)iend
---
I prefer a marine wetsuit. It really seals in the flavor
---
Ikr, I've been watching a YouTuber in the PTS. He's giving updates as he finds things out. Doing a lot of testing while he plays, only YouTuber worth watching tbh.
---
Never understood how it's enjoyable to just have all god tier legendary armors. As soon as you become untouchable in a game it takes all the fun and challenge out of it. All my legendary armors get turned into scrip before any of the weapons do, but that's probably just me
---
your current bounty is how much caps you will lose on death, if it is small (5 caps) you only lose 5 caps. if you where a bad boy and racked up a 100 cap bounty, you lose 100
---

---
Yeah been playing on Adventure mode lately and people kill the bosses in seconds.  I can imagine this is not fun for anyone who cant get in enough damage.
---
I would feel robbed if I launched a nuke only to have the boss killed before I can spin up my barrel.
---
You only lose a small amount of caps.
---
See above.
---
My bad. You're right. I think of all events as public events.
---
Heck yea, i had some level 200+ guy take me to a glowing one ghoul killing event, raised me by 4 leves up to around level 22, and scored a bunch of wild loot off the ghouls.  Then he took me to some pond, and we killed a giant mutant like swan from f04, and that gave me another level , haha in like 1 hour, 5 levels, was amazing, thanks kind stranger.
---
Stash your junk. Caps are meaningless. Ask another player to kill you.
---
You're welcome friend. It's what we do for the community
---
I haven't seen a hacked weapon, but I have heard one.  Someone had something that fired a shitload of mini-nukes or grenades or something when I was in my low levels at the airport, after finishing the event that's there for the Cargobot drop.  Just kinda made my system lag a little bit but unremarkable other than that.
---
Oh ok well i died and lost 10 caps to some level 131 asshole. I only picked a lock to an ammo dispenser :(
---
Look for the secret of Freddy Fears Basement for your chance to recoup your losses. 
---
I’ll say no more - good luck.
---
Thats rhe problem... As long as Bethesda keeps considering that people who acquired those weapons could have done it without knowledge and traded/bought it in game blablabla so they dont remove it, it will be worse and worse. I  can understand that they do this for duped items (if you have only one of, if tou have several, all instances should be deleted) but not for hacked weapons
---
Hopefully not, at the moment it's not nearly complete enough to even think releasing it as is, just like Legendary Perks were.
---
Today there's a PTS update though, so we'll see what they are doing with it.
---
Why do you need to farm flux?
---
Doors seem to break blueprints on prefabs rn in some cases as well.
---
Will confirm. I added asbestos to my armor a few days ago. This totally works 100%.
---
Good. I saw this was only half way yesterday. This was the only one I worked on. I have spent the weeks since we learned it was cloth to unlock the collectron grabbing every cloth, rag, money, shooting in rage every scavenger who complains about finding 200 bucks and then mentions burning it, etc.
---
I now have 70 of these provisions one one toon and somewhere around 40 scattered on the other four. I like CAMP items and feeling like it wasn’t going to happen and from the Reddit’s and 76 forums no one cared made me sad.
---
Baaaa....😀 we now want the Encrypted Sheepsquatch Assaultron participating in ACP to make it more enjoyable.
---
Wait you can't catapult yourself or others anymore??? Damn found a great view last night as well whilst adventuring
---
It works.
---
Whether or not you think it's worth 5 points is a different story.  1, absolutely.
---
Honestly I am on this sub every day when I'm supposed to be working and have not seen anyone mention that the Tesla issue has been fixed on PTS. There's lots of other good info being posted but this, at least for me since I am a Tesla noob, is huge huge huge news. I was already looking forward to One Wasteland for scaled loot, but now I'm even more excited to know I can use my fave gun again. 😁

With the exception on New Vegas, the development time on these games has been 7-10 years. With 76 releasing in 2018, if they started development on Fallout 5 immediately we’d be looking at a 2025-2028 release date. We know they didn’t do that because of Starfield. IF there’s another Fallout coming, we likely won’t see it until 2030 or later. This is my favorite game franchise by far. I’ve been playing since 1997. I’m just not going to get my hopes up that a real, single player, story driven  Fallout 5 is on the horizon.
---
Needs to be a server not bogged down. It's based on having a high frame rate.
---
Yes, let's us all pretend this isn't a game-breaking problem right now so you can keep pretending the game is perfect...
---
The more SCORE I lose because of bugs that have been in the game for over a year, but they found convenient not to fix because challenges rewarded atoms, no doubt makes just as many people, if not more, less willink to sink money in a game with such shitty motenization practices.
---
be aware different areas of the map are ‘better’ for different color flux.
---
for example, morgantown has lots of cobalt, but not much violet.
---
Toxic valley and fissure prime have lots of violet - the enemies in toxic valley different, and unless you incLude Wavy Willard’s, may not be quite as plentiful.
---
WS has lots of everything except violet.
---
There is a big big différence between buged weapon and hacked weapon...
---
Cat meat steaks are fantastic food items.
---
But if it doesn't mean anything, is it still an acronym? 🤔
---
I mean it's unfortunate but this is easily the worst fallout game
---
Yeh it is great news, no more ghouls aimlessly standing with no head and invincible, all enemy types. Goo piles can also now be looted properly to.
---
Send me a pm.ill trade you that qEx cryo for a few things that should be able to get with some grind.
---
I see. So thats why they eat away when im alone but with more people around it wont do as much
---
I want a cryo handmade ^^ (obvisouly joking)
---
Cranberry!!
---
They don't work on SB per the datamining thread last year. Would be nice if the game let you know that little detail..
---
I think they will be in the shop until the 7th of september.
---
So you stole from someone, but they are the asshole?
---
I lure them into a choke point, pull out my vampire gat and I'm like McDonalds, with 1 billion served. I'm lovin it.
---
Yes.    
---
That's exactly what it is but also vomiting. Imagine if they made it show up visually in-game. They need a "Point and Laugh" emote.
---
That was probably the worst movie of all time. .....
---
Well yeah, obviously the game engine wasn't originally designed for multiplayer.  But that doesn't mean when they shoehorned in the multiplayer code that they had to just "make it work" and then leave it at that.  Certainly I have taken old code and shoehorned in a new function that was never intended to be done in that program as a stopgap or bandaid, but you can't just proof of concept something and then leave it as production code unless you want it to keep kicking you in the ass over and over.
---
That's the part that I don't understand.  Yeah, they made a single player game and engine multiplayer, and it's a really cool idea but poor execution in a lot of ways.  And there are a lot of easily fixable issues (well theoretically easy.  I have no way of knowing how much of a cluster f the code is) that shouldn't take a lot of work to make things far better from a usability standpoint.  But if it "works" then spending time fixing problems isn't fun and doesn't really make any money, at least on the front end.  And it's obvious that they are trying to wring all the money they can out of the game, which I don't have problems with them making money on it.  But, they are certainly shooting themselves in the foot in the long run, though maybe they don't really care if the games lasts long term if they are already drowning in money with how things are currently.
---
I'm glad in my job that my boss will let me make it work right instead of only making it work.  And I have a feeling that the programmers adding features and maintaining the code for FO76 would likely make it work right if they could.  I doubt it's a lack of skill problem, but I imagine their hands are tied for the most part.  I have certainly worked jobs in the past where I was only given time to make it work and not to make it work right.  It's defeating when you actually care about the quality of the work you put out but your manager(s) won't give you the time necessary to put out quality code.
---
But, it just goes to show how amazing the game really is that even with all these dumb issues it's still successful and certainly it is a miracle that it doesn't crash and choke more than it already does!  I have been a fan of fallout since the start, and it kills me to see the state things are in with FO76 when the possibility for greatness is just under the surface.
---
Can’t wait to get that military footlocker at rank 4 that looks like a sink!
---
well, i hope that happens here.  I don't relish the idea of having to reinstall.  downloading again would take a chunk out of my monthly data.

That's why I wear the Chinese stealth suit, it lets it all flow to the bottom and keep me warm
---
Keep a JE GP in my back pocket for fun and when a group on ACP or sbq needs a boost to push through the event. Mostly use a 50 cal. JE GP has high likelihood of turning myself into a goo pile and requires high perk investment not to break every min. With 1 rank in gunsmith it would break every 500 or so shots.
---
a man who lives in a glass house should not cast stones.. unless he has an automated anti aircraft gun on his property

May have to rethink some aspects of my bunker

Happened to me while doing ACP too, burned 5 fusion cores with my vampire Ultracite laser to tank Earle and he dropped nothing, I even waited because loot can take some time to appear, but nothing showed

When I first left the vault I was trying figure out how to build a camp and a high level player to my confusion was shooting at me and striking the ground. I finally realized there was a paper bag in front of me with clothing inside to replace my vault suit and stims. At that moment the outfit was a prize. As a high level player now I try to remember that my excess of what I consider mostly useless stuff is a big deal for a new player with nothing.
---
Yeah.  But with Earl it just gives you back the ammo you use without even having to craft it.
---
I'll start with play bloodied heavy, but I always keep a mele ready to hot swap to, just I  case nobody handles the spawn waves.
---
So last night someone drops a nuke, we join in and start the fight, and a huge wave hits, I killed a good 20 to 25 spawns with only a couple of them slipping past me, thought that wave was never going to end. Then a short while later I get downed in the fight, and not a single player could be bothered to pick me up, even though there were 2 to 3 players near me.
---
I'm sorry, but when I see a downed player I try to bolt across the room to pick them up, I don't care if I have to run through a ton of spawn to do it. I might play a low life build but that doesn't mean I can't pop a stim pack, smack some spawns, and press A to revive.
---
So to the guys that sit and watch someone throw the downed panic emote through their downed state, you guys are the true douchebags of the game.
---
All atomic shop paint/skins? Or did you find some tradable rarities? *nudge nudge*
---
I can only hope we will be able to buy the greenhouse set with bouillon at some point because nothing else is remotely interesting in the rewards :/ i am really sad because I’ve been wanting this set for a long time.. not like this x x
---
It's posts like this that make me wish we had a true Fallout lore discussion Discord sever.
---
Would have been nice if rose said “Hey maybe those giant bats will get lured out of the sky by one”...
---
I found out about it on a random Reddit comment, can’t imagine how people get by on this game without this sub...
---
No no no i stole from someone THEN some OTHER rando comes to my camp and kills me. Not the guy i stole from
---
I remember hearing rumors in the past about Aries might have been one... I don’t think it’s true though.
---
Level 25 theres a quest for excavator armor
---
*laughes in console*
---
Ah ok thanks
---
I have a sinking feeling it will be renamed to "hidden military footlocker" (...in a sink) ;)
---
You were wanted for stealing, they were not the asshole.
---
One of the atom challenges is to kill wanted players so there’s always plenty of people who will shoot you if your wanted, if your lucky and they are just putting you out of your misery as it were they may open a trade menu with you so you can sell them some spoiled veg etc for the amount of caps you lost but if it’s the person you tried to steal from its unlikely. Best not to pick locks on locks that come up with red text as in players camp water purifiers, resource machinery, ammo dispensers and converters. If someone has locked their stuff it’s probably because they need the stuff they’re making like ammo, or they just don’t feel like sharing but whatever the case if you try to break into their stuff you’ll end up wanted. As others have said if you get naked, stash your stuff and hang about whitesprings that will indicate to other players that you just want to get it over and done with, get shot, and don’t want to be constantly looking over your shoulder and potentially lose the junk your carrying
---
I have never been in an instance of more than three people.  Regardless of how quickly I join.   The game doesn’t actually want me to do this event
---
I’m actually swapping 3 different chest pieces depending on what I’m doing. Asbestos for Earle, pneumatic for mrs. queen, and wwr jetpack for normal farming. It’s 30 lbs, but worth it.
---
The BOS field station at level 76 looks awesome!
---
This isn’t necessarily true. The words you’re after are “the more of something *is in circulation* the less valuable it is”. That’s why the gold standard works. That’s why silver is cheap. But there’s one guy with a fuck ton of silver. If he goes bankrupt and sells all his silver on the market, then the price of silver will plummet.
---
I'm actually excited to see if bethesda will elaborate on them or if it will just be another silent ug qualoth type situation
---
Lowest level power armor is the Raider PA at lv15. You have a chance to find the pieces for it early on from various raider locations around the map (google it) or by asking someone to craft one for you (someone that has the right plans).
---
I guess we'll see if they announce the Patch 22 date.
---
I haven't been following these bums that moved in asking for my goodies. Is this the collectron that was purchasable through the atom shop all this time, or some other iteration?
---
I gave 35k cloth. I earned mine :\
---
Hacked weapons are pretty easy to spot because they all have something slightly off about the visual. Either it’s a beam splitter, or a mini gun barrel on a non minigun, or in the case of the 50cal it’s missing the back handle. The 50 cal is probably the hardest to spot but is obvious once it starts shooting like an explosive Gatling plasma rather than a typical 50 call.
---
It just takes time and patience. PA is usually at level 15 minimum but you can at least wear a frame regardless of level once you find one. As for earning caps, do every event that you're able to at your level. Sell chems, grenades and mines at the vendors for super easy caps. You're gonna be swimming in things like frag grenades and chems like Psycho or Mentats which can be sold in bulk for nice amounts of caps. Good luck!
---
Oh man, I'm actually gonna have to put in the effort for season 2. I want that greenhouse set something fierce!
---
Yeah, so don’t do that.
---
Caps find stuff to sell to the train station vendors and join event teams
---
Happened to me last night in Encrypted...was literally standing right next to the bastard when he went vulnerable and still couldn’t get a shot off quick enough! Rough times in the Wasteland
---
Don't worry about buying anything at your level right now.
---
Thaks for the info! Trying to come back once its changed and start fresh.
---
Yeah but like i just wanted a bit of ammo. When your as new as me ammo is kind of hard to come by. Sooo i took advantage of the fact that some guy left an ammo dispenser locked at level 0 and i took some. But yeah i guess its kind of a dick move. Still i think i kinda needed that .38 ammo a BIT more than some level 60 guy who probably wont even notice its gone
---
You knowingly stole from someone, you deserve the wanted level.
---
No, I think durability should stay at its level, but the damage improved to be better than ballistic. 
---
My reasoning is that energy weapons are more complex than ballistic weapons. So they "should" be more difficult to maintain imho, but should punch holes through enemies.  
---
Also, lasers pistols/rifles should have no recoil...
---
Also, gatling lasers should have an ammo pack mod...
---
Rip all the people like me  that mostly wanted the glass walls (lvl 99)
---
"*Knight Moreno to... I guess no one?*"
---
Why do people want acid? I have so much and I can’t figure out why I’d want more
---
I was hoping the Armor Ace PA station/PA stands would be a season reward...
---
Also, what's the logic behind giving an Armor Ace skin to the backpack, but all the regular armors have Red Viper skins? I would have definitely loved to wear an Armor Ace Secret Service set. Edit: There also are only Communist outfits and not even a single Power Patrol one, so not  sure what we're supposed to match that backpack with :c
---
Built up farts
---
It was like 15 .38 ammo, i was level 9, and the guy i stole from was like level 60. I think i needed it a bit more
---
FYI, if Season 2 goes to mid-December then it must be a 12 week event. Because 10 weeks would end in November.
---
I just depends on what you carry more of.
---
I had the weight problem last night also.  I jumped from 430/430 as I was jogging along to 785/430.
---
Reloading my perks fixed it.
---
Not sure if you know, but you can just use that extra time when the event tells you to escape to loot all the bodies around you, you won't die, when the timer runs out you will just be placed outside the cave - with a bunch of extra screws in your pocket ;)
---
Pick up junk as you can, you will learn what junk is most important over time. Just dont forget to break down your scrap at a workbench before putting it in your stash box or you will fill your stash box up too quickly. I would advise checking the junk section of your stash and pulling everything out and checking whether or not everything as been scrapped at a work bench. Some items will not automatically scrap when you select the scrap all junk at a work bench, the reason is that some scrap has a secondary use or is specifically needed whole for a recipie, it is up to you if you decide to manually scrap these items, but I will say some of these can weigh quite a bit.
---
Baseless speculation time: They absorbed/founded Bethesda Austin to do work on 76, &amp; most of the studio is now assisting on Starfield. I think it'd make sense for them to, after working w the main team for awhile/taking on some of their senior staff, be assigned to go make full games on their own. *It just works,* monetarily-speaking.
---
It could be a disaster, but with the ridiculous increases in profitability following Skyrim &amp; Fo4, I think there's hundreds of millions of $$ of incentives to speed up the dev process, &amp; I really can't see Beth Austin as anything other than an attempt at just that.
---
Same here! I've been wanting glass walls and roofs since day 1. I'm way more stoked on season 2 than I was on this one already.
---
It's still stealing. Lockpicking a container accidentally in a taken workshop because you didn't know you would become wanted is one thing, but knowingly stealing from someone is your own fault, regardless of your level.
---
Yes, the only guns that aren't possible to get are the legacies. Which are any energy weapons with explosive, and Legendary The Dragon (no idea why this one is a legacy?) and explosive Radium rifles.
---
Also I think legendary Rippers and Chainsaws don't exist.
---
I’m not 100% sure but I heard something about all/if not most camp items from legendary run will be available or gold bullion if you don’t catch it in time.
---
I would recommend setting your camp up at a water source and as soon as you get water purifier plans start selling your purified water. Sells pretty good actually
---
👍
---
You hit the fo76 lotto my friend, congrats.
---
No doubt, but those are all marked as Atomic Shop items. In other words:  
---
a) dropping them will destroy them  
---
b) you will NOT get the [favourited item warning](https://i.imgur.com/RLE5vST.jpg) that is automatically set to *"Don't drop"* but the [Atomic Shop item warning](https://i.imgur.com/SnbaYVM.jpg) that the items will be destroyed which is pre-set to *"Yes"* which makes it all the more easy to destroy your legendary item :/
---
This is the BoS version of that Collectron.  So free goodies every so often.
---
I take it you hadn't showered that day?
---
I have a Bloodied Prime Gauss Minigun, after I used 3000 rounds and died 3 times I just gave up.  I figured why should I reward those guys and just started collecting myself.
---
??
---
Thank you.
---
I can see the argument for not banning (although I don't entirely agree with it, as I think the vast majority of people with these items know EXACTLY what they're doing) but there's no sound argument for not removing these items and securing the engine better to prevent their introduction.  Even if they're not going to ban users of these items they should mark their accounts and alert them that they've been found using a hacked item, and not to do it again.
---
Ok well its kind of a mix of both. First, i had no idea about what wanted was before i picked the lock. Second, i did know i was stealing but i saw that the guy was like level 60 and i had barely any ammo at all so i assumed he wouldnt miss it
---
Imagine it pooling around your feet in the PA boots, between your toes...and how it kinda stings your blisters a little bit...
---
The rad resistance is a little less, but the legendary effects with a diluted radaway make PA seem like a lessor choice for me.
---
I see everyone got defensive about it. What can I say? Good for you?
---
Let me explain. If something breaks for 80% of people, there is 20% of people who see it working fine like you. Doesn't mean problems don't exist.
---
There was a total shit storm of bug reports back when I tried it, and many of them also happened to me. Now everyone is trying to do total recall on me like nothing happened and I was delusional. Feels toxic.
---
And a heavy would obviously carry more heavy weapons, hence bear arms being better for heavies.
---
Better than it being in the shop...
---
No problem.  They’re mounting up an expedition to Appalachia and moving into the ATLAS Observatory.  Some local nut is fortifying it for when they arrive.  I’m not betting they’re good guys.  *Paranoid Free States Noises*
---
I heard this as well from several PTS testers, which is good....b/c I have a full time job and 2 kids, so finding time to grind season 1 was tough. I'm only rank 62 as of last night.
---
It's extra seasoned with salt from the mines.
---
They were mass duped and handed out to randoms, dropped in bags near train stations, suitcases, etc.
---
Not a glitch. You won a rare prize pack. Congrats.
---
With instigating, Angry Turtle has said that it's damage buff is applied during a short time. So for majority of weapons it's only one shot. But faster firing guns like Gatling Lasers and the M2 can get a couple of double damage shots off.
---
A [combat knife skin](https://i.imgur.com/Owrqb02.jpg) the plan for which you could get during the Treasure Hunter event.
---
70% damage reduction, free repairs from repair kits, infinite fusion cores from just finding them, your  ignore 45% of armor, highlighting your enemies at night to see them, no limb damage which means I can't get crippled, less stagger...
---
Gotta a lot of builds in mind...
---
Like i wouldnt steal from someone thats like level 10 or 12 or something. Cause i know they actually NEED their ammo,water,food etc. But this guy clearly wasnt gonna miss the like 15 .38 ammo that i stole
---
It sounds like something I can definitely tolerate. Thanks for the input.
---
That is the way those items drop. Not a glitch or bug.
---
I'm glad it's not just me. I'm on PS4 pro with 100 meg Internet and there times when it's like 1-5 FPS.
---
The few times it's happened to me I noticed Tesla fire around me and we were all grouped up by the entrance where you drop down. I'm not sure if it's because of the Tesla's or the number of people around each other but when it happens all you can do is hope you don't get killed in between screen refreshes. I just pop a stimpak ever few seconds just in case.
---
This also happened to me once in Radiation rumble.
---
They said they were looking at it as a possibility, but never explicitly stated anything would be happening.
---
Do you play heavy?  I carry 2.  I also carry more meds than that, in terms of weight.  So no, traveling pharmacy is better for me.
---
Kool thank you again
---
Nice!they drop its rare.i wear my scout mask always and it looks good with the gillie hood mask.try it out.got my package from uranium fever!
---
Not a glitch, you can be rewarded a bundle of the scout mask and the BOS, whitespring, and white powder jumpsuits like you said. It's a rare drop from completing events
---
Bloodied does have some resistance counter balances with perks like radicol, serendipity, dodgy, secret service armor has power stats, and food like cranberry cobbler. I rarely die. 😃
---
I'm sorry people not validating your specific viewpoint feels like an attack.
---
This is true but I’d rather it just be available from vendors.. like all the other wall type plans in the game or thru a questline or from the raiders or settlers.
---
No, I don't believe that was ever the case.
---
There're bots that autodownvote all posts on this sub like most videogame subs have. It's nothing personal, it's just a couple knuckleheads with a tiny bit of know how, and a chip on their shoulder.
---
I well aware of their intentions, but they can eat bag of  d#cks if they think they are getting an ounce of my scrap. It's just going to add more player locked gold based weapons and armor. Making this more a single player game. I'm fine with that I just wish they would pick one.
---
Ah. So by this logic, it’s okay to shoplift from a big box store, and it would be silly for anyone to call the police to report it as a ‘crime’.
---
has it been datamined yet? what does it collect?
---
This happend to me yesterday I just left the game for couple hours and came back and it started working again
---
My cats’ breath smells like cat food.
---
people really dont pay attention to the exact wording, i feel. if something is implied as a possibility, they take it as a fact
---
M8 its a videogame. No one is really being affected in any real meaningful way by me stealing 15 fucking .38 ammo. Who gives a shit
---
as a member of the brotherhood it is my responsibility to wipeout those abominations and to keep you safe. there's no need for thanks you deserve it thankyou for helping keep the wasteland clean of these monsters
---
If they are food builds you should have no issue running a shotgun through their base with Wrecking Ball on. There's no perk that increases building health.
---
I'm not sure about "getting something to help" other than your monthly atoms, I always figured if there were to be some special 1st feature it'd be about some additional reward.
---
Well per the FAQ “A: Cosmetic rewards are limited during a Season to players who earn them through progression. Utility items, such as Lunchboxes, the Ammo Converter, and Chicken Coop from Season 1 have been added to the Gold Bullion store to give players another chance to claim them.” So.. I guess we have to see if they consider it to be a cosmetic vs utility.
---
Now you know that picking a lock in an owned workshop or camp will gain you wanted. Do it again, that's on you. Also, .38 ammo is the most common in game so there's no need to steal it. I leave hundreds outside the Wayward multiple times in one sitting.
---
They said they were looking into it, so i hoped they would put something into play this season, never took it as fact
---
For things like that it's better to keep your expectations low and be pleasantly surprised if it does happen. Unfortunately it's something they mentioned introducing in the future but there weren't any explicit details IIRC.
---
Some guy on this sub reddit suggested that you should bloat fly syringers which spawn those bugs which give you materials. You can then continuously keep doing with the bloat flys until you get enough.

At least to my knowledge it was nerfed early last year because we flew too close to the sun lol

FFS just looked again as had 3 levels to use - this time the commando cards I had been looking for were there first time!  I honestly don't know why they were not there before as I did exactly the same thing I always do when picking a card, unless I somehow kept missing them.
---
XP definitely needs adjustment first
---
To me the whole point of being heavy is not taking much damage and having lots of different guns to play with. You shouldn't need a ton of stimpaks as a heavy, because you can take the damage. Seems like a major waste of inventory. Lots of health, lots of damage absorbed in good armor, no reason for that many stims. Run out of ammo for one big toy? Switch to another and keep shredding. 2 weapons on a heavy seems like you aren't even fully enjoying the experience, but keep doing you I guess lol
---
Per the FAQ “A: We may add extra Fallout 1st bonus rewards in the future, but want to focus on getting Seasons in the game first and seeing your thoughts.”
---
Once the nerf hits with Patch 22, no one will be one shooting anything so settle down  lol
---
You obviously give a shit because you're here trying to figure out how to lose wanted you got from stealing lol
---
It was a fallout 4 feature that various mods expounded upon.
---
Example: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/46893](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/46893)
---
 "**The Main FX Pack** that is included with this adds new:  
---
\- Impact Sounds (Flesh on Ballistic)  
---
\- Grenade Explosions (Dependent on Distance)  
---
\- Gore/dismemberment sounds  
---
\- Grenade Pin/Throw (All ported from Warzone) """
---
Flesh on ballistic SFX for fallout 4/76 is a thing, certain weapons will repeat this sound to tell you how many times you get hit.
---
And obviously I play heavy or I wouldn't have commented
---
If more than one people on a team are sharing strange in numbers, that number will further increase because it is a perk that stacks.
---
Just got a TSE fixer 3* so will give that a whirl.
---
If it’s locked with a Level 0 Lock, then that’s usually a deliberate temptation to get players like you to be tagged as Wanted.
---
Oof. Only interested in rank 99..
---
S.C.O.R.E
---
Some Challenges Obviously Require Editing
---
Convince me otherwise 🙃
---
exactly.
---
I am whelmed. Not over or under, just whelmed.
---
I just don’t understand how people who complain so much about the game never keep themselves informed about the game.
---
You’re trying to justify it because of the player’s level. And you’re deflecting and calling them an asshole. 
---
Maybe take some personal responsibility for your own actions. You stole something. You got caught. You lost some caps. 
---
Move along and stop whining about it.
---
Lol imagine needing to buy hacked shit on eBay because you aren’t friends with the people who made them
---
Your welcome
---
I don't use stims.  What I do need however is rad away and diluted rad away to manage rads, as well as toxic goo, I also use many other stat boosting chems.  You know what experience I don't enjoy is making 5 different types of ammo.  I much prefer to just pump out 10 to 20k 50 cal ammo.
---
The atoms were more than enough help for me to buy some levels so I didn’t have to grind every day
---
Mole men have become fallouts dwarven race. We may see them in the future at other mines.
---
Happened to me twice in a row this week, it’s definitely really frustrating.
---
here lies andy
---
peperony and cheese
---
Strange, but I'm on Firefox and everything reset without even closing the window.
---
The moment I saw them I knew what I was going to do to my camp
---
It's getting ridiculous at this point really. I've been sick recently and thought maybe the double score will mean I can finish it up but no dice.
---
This story gets a lot weirder if you read it thinking at first that you were talking about irl.
---
Unless it's a hacked weapon. They seem to do such ungodly levels of damage that they can outright kill you with slap damage.
---
Had a guy do that a month or two ago during the SBQ. He instantly killed the queen, and after the event was over and everyone got their rewards. He used his hacked M2 to kill everyone around him one by one to steal the stable flux you get as a reward.
---
I always get it from eating too much spoiled meat lmao
---
Yep I feel you I lost out on my weekly challenges too. F
---
Every day I take 2 grenades from the artillery piece on my camp and blast the cars in front of Pleasant Valley Station, or the South Cutthroat Camp. Fireworks are great and if there's someone around it's always more fun.
---
Any of those ultracite nodes can be used for that, some of them you can hit them multiple times, and some of them just disappear after you use them. That spot, there's a bunch of them all around that fissure and if you've got more than 1 person, you can get a bunch of scorched spawned in there.
---
Go forth and wreak nuclear fire!
---
1600 checking in
---
That is the ghilli hunting rifle skin from last season - the image is just stuck on the new season for some reason
---
Why would you thank them? That's odd.
---
Gorge junkyard sometimes has s set of raider power armor in the trailer, but its level 3 locked, and you cant open level 3 locks till way higher levels. But if you had a teammate who could do so, thats a level 15 partial set. Note, like many spawns its only sometimes there.
---
If you own the workshop, you may be able to unlock it yourself, since its "your" lock now. I know that works on containers, havent tried on the trailer door.
---
read the description, my dude. 12 Vintage Nukashines. That's the thumbnail from Season 1 that hasn't been fixed yet.
---
There's a Zombie variant called Organ Trail, but it looks just like the OG.
---
This is why I have two Kibos (portapotties) in my camp....
---
If you want fusion cores, another easy way to get them is to craft gatling lasers with super duper and Science Master (pretty sure it's science master, whichever one of the science perks that says "Your crafted energy guns require less materials") each Gatling Laser you craft comes with a fusion core. And all the parts for a gatling laser as easy to farm a couple hundred of in a short time.
---
can someone post to imgur and link? cant pull it up at work and these 12's are killin me.
---
Gonna disagree. 
---
Your gonna want them for daily ops which is why Assassins is getting a buff.
---
Because of how much I appreciate it obviously
---
Glass roof ! I've been waiting for this forever ! My first Fallout 4 house had a glass roof so i can look at the stars while working in my workshop and customizing my bots. Great memories !
---
Thanks for the news ! 👍
---
Dang you are right. I feel like an idiot
---
MVP!
---
Wish we have more PSAs like this.
---
It is Reddit. 
---
There will be downvoting.
---
Well luckily that's never happened to me but I can just imagine how annoyed you were! Did you lose the weekly and dailies at the same time?
---
You sweet summer tadpole. 
---
We won’t spoil the fun of discovery for you.
---
Whitesprings hotel *cough*
---
That's the case for the Gauss Shotgun but the Minigun doesn't have a hardened receiver. And the prime receiver adds a good chunk of extra damage that the tesla capacitors doesn't.
---
The BOS collectron will generate scrap, ammo, beer, and grenades.
---
So essentially, infinite provisions minus plans, snacks and medicine.
---
Because the ammo weighs very little compared to the flux, I just craft the ammo to keep the stashbox from being full.  Then when you have a lot of prime ammo you can just mod your favorite gun to prime and have some extra damage for a few weeks.  Some weapons like the lmg and plasma weapons stay prime though, because ammo for them is not plentiful or easy to craft unless it's prime.
---
Are they set up through trigger words or just new posts in general?
---
You have to do a certain number of damage to them to get loot. Sbq is 1000, not sure about Earl.
---
On the flip of this mechanic, when you take ownership of a workshop, all of the containers become unlocked to you (even if they had level 3 locks).
---
The first time I became wanted was due to a footlocker at Wade airport....
---
Then for the minigun, I’d say it’s worth. On the other two, I still wouldn’t think it’s worth the flux.
---
It's just the uselessness of the comment that got to me.
---
It's like me asking "Is this road safe, do people die here?" and you answering "Well I have no clue about others because I don't care, but I'm alive, so I guess that means the road is super safe." Like what kind of logic is this?
---
When you say that "the mess at the launch was a legend" and I read this while remembering my own experience and the amount of ridicule and criticism this game received at launch, it sounds like such denialism, that it's hard to take your opinion seriously. Not much to do with validation.
---
I’m glad this is something they still haven’t fixed, I wear the BOS Officers Underarmor and the gloves appear on my hunters Longcoat and it looks awesome.
---
I gave 3k - good work!
---
I’m the screw master. Also I loot Wendigos.
---
Well tbh i still want to know what kind of armour and weapons seem the best at this state of game, I have no clue on what to use or try to trade or grind for
---
Camp invincibility was implemented in survival at same time as in adventure servers, so your argument has no ground to stand on
---
You can
---
I love the mind blown emote lol
---
That's a cool idea.  Use a prime Guass rifle to farm ammo for the minigun...
---
OP was asking about .45 and 5.56 I think... yeah for gauss mini you need to craft and ultracite is more efficient for steel/lead if you have the flux/ultracite - that is an expensive gun to run  ...
---
I knew grabbing all those Yao Gaui hides from Primal Cuts would be worth it for something
---
Who can resist that dumptruck of an ass, though?
---
September 15th can't get here soon enough. I am ready...
---
This. Level 15 Raider Power Armor.  Asking is always a good bet with this community.
---
Lol who knows
---
Man.... I’ve been doing those events in hopes of that drop.  Been trying to get a scout mask for a while.  Last night I did the majority of that event by myself before everyone started showing up.  I hit 4 legendary ghouls running towards the jukebox.... I’ve never seen that many before.  Of course they weren’t quality drops, but at least it’s scrip!
---
Don't ask me, i'm a moleminer
---
Nice!
---
I’m not sure where to get the plans for crafting the gun and I’m not sure where to find mods for it. 
---
I got a god ultracite gun roll (and I have the plan for crafting it), so I decided to go on a ultracite laser gun fiesta and crafted dozens so I could learn all the mods.
---
and m8, the weapon is plain awful. it’s like a laser rifle but with increased RoF and lower damage. A LOT LESS DAMAGE. A .38 pipe gun gets you the same damage output.
---
I would love this! Would be a neat addition to the current taxidermy quests - they could implement them at Lowe’s Taxidermy :) or other small side quests like the wendigo mount
---
So like my kids' diaper? Very Very Ripe Cheese.
---
Why am I not surprised that the same person who needs to hack a weapon is the same person who would describe it that way?
---
Tell her to try out ugly hairstyles with cute hats on. I wear the insurgent hat mostly, and I change my hairstyle almost every day just for fun so I’ve tried almost all of them. A few of the ugly styles look totally normal with a hat on
---
👀👀👀👀👀
---
My CAMP uses so many of the first season awards already, but season two looks amazing!!
---
I kill the weindego spawns so I can get adrenaline lol
---
What the fuck kinda roads are you traveling on?
---
Not a problem. I've been playing on a pistol build lately. I can barely put a dent in earl even with an AA, better crits, gauss pistol so I'm always on spawn duty and revives for the people with the more powerful builds. On my heavy gunner I can solo the event but frankly that's kinda boring so I prefer to play a support role atm. The gauss pistol does just fine on the wendigo spawns. It's a real shame pistol builds are so underpowered. I have a lot of fun being a gunslinger but I always feel very behind the curve, even with a junkies western revolver.
---
Also the fact the the gauss pistol doesn't have a prime receiver is kinda insulting. The gauss shotgun doesn't even need one and they get one. Why can't I (who actually need a damage buff) get one?
---
Lmao 😂😂😂
---
Fair enough, ended up getting her to make a raider character with me, now we both just have mohawks. Lol
---
[this guy...](https://media.tenor.com/images/5e0f51c53dc0faebae9fc4b947b65048/tenor.gif)
---
No there won’t.
---
And from all the reports it sounds like they need to do it again.
---
So one week of no weekly or dailies rewarding anything . 😕
---
That would be some sh*t wouldn’t it? It brings you all the stuff you donated...
---
I remember vomiting over a horde of zombies in Dead Rising, it wasn't that bad...
---
rewards are trash.
---
I would not bother with The raider PA. Just make shure you collect a descent amount of black titanium and craft the escevator at lvl25. Best PA in the game in my opinion
---
BOOTY PENIS™️
---
One perk point for a temporary 6% damage buff is where is at. An additional perk point for only a 1% increase in damage is just not worth it. Bloody mess though go for all 3 and depending on your build all 3 ranks of perks like nerd rage for bloodied.
---
Thank you for clearing that up! I was a little more focused on trying to help players with better weapons than me. Trying to keep the weindigos off 'em. That might have been the problem! Thanks again!
---
Just a heads up for you, during PTS testing for Wastelanders, a lot of issues were addressed and fixed but Never made it live and they still exist today, vats being one of them.
---
No idea . By the sounds of it nothing lol or Bethesda is going to surprise us lol
---
Meh. Bloodied is better because it has a flat dmg bonus over them lol
---
Yes there won’tn’t.
---
1 steel per 6 bullets is way too much for Fallout Second players.   .50 cal really isn't that efficient, it just happens to hit pretty hard, is easy to aim, and doesn't need much lead.
---
the fuck are you doing around *any* screen while Uncle Sid is in town?
---
For PA, there are a lot of spawn points. You can wear a chassis at any level; just remove the exterior pieces. At level 15, Raider Armor is available, but the pieces can spawn at higher levels, FYI. 
---
Here is [a map](https://fo76map.com) that can help you find Power Armor spawn points as well as other things. 
---
As far as gaining caps, sell the weapons and armor you find on enemies to vendors. Build some water purifiers and sell the purified waters to vendors. 
---
Build vending machines and sell your excess ammo and chems for about 1c each for ammo and about 20-25% Base Value for the rest. 
---
You’ll eventually learn ways to get your daily 1400 caps.
---
well if the spartan's suit can jack him off, I don't see why power armor can't do the same.
---
They said they were exploring it but hadn’t committed to anything.
---
The glass walls will make for some really cool camps
---
Just keep going to the enclave and pick up the quest for it
---
Tried to go to whitesprings bunker and locate the keycard?
---
That would be wonderful, if only to hear the screechings of "bUT fALlOut 76 IsN't cANnon!!1!"
---
You’re welcome. Like I said, I don’t know how much damage Earl needs but I feel it’s two, three times more than the queen. Just keep shooting till he’s down. :)
---
Everything posted, they're basically indiscriminate. It happens a lot in gaming/hobby subs
---
/r/ffxiv is SUUUUPER bad with them
---
Most of them don't touch comments, but anything made as an actual post is targeted
---
Down in the whitesprings bunker you can use a computer that will start a repeatable quest showing on the map where a cargoship is currently flying.
---
It cost you exactly $0 to not say that.
---
Make 5 chars. Grab one wjth each char each day. 35 cards/week
---
It's so easy to farm steel.  I really don't have a problem with it.
---
A question with a lot of answers my friend. 
---
Pick a weapon type **you like to play with** and honestly just take in Wastelanders and it’s story. 
---
**I will give you one tip:**
---
You can max both factions quest line for Wastelanders. 
---
There’s serious rewards for taking both Raiders and Settlers to the decision point before you make your final choice.
---
A lot of players only do one and then get hit with a “gold” grind to get the questline rewards they ignored. 
---
Good luck
---
I've seen a scorched Mr. Gutsy though, its a bug.
---
And besides, if the brain jar would have to be punctured to expose the brain to the scorched plague, so it would die of exposure to all the other horrible radioactive germs and shit.
---
I am surprised that next season starts just week after season one ends. Since this one seem to have 12 weeks, I won't complain.
---
Had no idea that was a thing lol
---
Not a dumb question but the answer is yet another oversight.
---
Diseases could use a bit of rework. Imagine if when you died when infected with bloodworms, a Fallout 4 bloodworm popped out of your corps. Maybe it even eats your loot bag and you have to hunt it down to get it back.
---
Did it two hours ago. It failed suddenly with no apparent reason.
---
I'll take overall damage over utility in this game, more damage means less shots, less materials and higher survivability. Not saying you can't survive without doing this, just telling the new guy how to get on other guys strength levels.👍
---
How the hell have they managed to make mistakes on the season pass section of the website... jesus christ Bethesda
---
Do the first story and it’ll give you a full suit of Ultracite power armor once you do the brotherhood part.
---
Maybe make your post and only hit the submit buttons once? Or at least clean up your spam afterwards
---
For those that have played Oregon Trail, I would like to remind you that dysentery can kill you.
---
Uncapped framerate?
---
Not for the favorited items using the Atomic Shop skins :/  
---
You will only get [this one](https://i.imgur.com/SnbaYVM.jpg) (set automatically to dropping).
---
I used to until I learned that you can just kill super muties, have high int, and use scrapper perk for 20+ steel per assault rifle dropped by them.
---
Or even more easily, I just ask for it and a Fallout First hoarder will drop 8k at my feet like it's nothing.
---
Nice job man!
---
That was my thought, sounds like the issue when you go to 144 fps.
---
What the hell is a Health kit. 
---
I really wish they would stop making quest and event rewards into challenge rewards. 
---
It comes across ultra low effort imho.
---
It is going to take FOREVER to get the smell out of my power armor. I suspect either the air recycling system or the frame will have to be replaced entirely.
---
Angry Turtle?
---
Referring more to the damage reduction which you’ll definitely want as a bloodied player
---
Yeah i have a 144 hz monitor, guess that breaks the game
---
That's what I do.  Just go to west tek, and soon just anywhere with super mutants and get steel.
---
Possible rewards/Atom shop purchase
---
I don't mind them not being available. I kind of like finding them in the wild.
---
It's activated for me every time there is a notification in the top left of the screen. Actually pretty handy, it lets me know to eat when I'm suffering from starvation lol.
---
there was a joke about how the suit worn by master chief john 117 in halo could jack him off and Brian David Gilbert made several references to it in his video where he read every piece of halo lore. [Here](https://youtu.be/WEWEdIcx1DI) is the video for reference
---
But theyre asking a question on the games sub to get information on the game and correct their misunderstanding.
---
Same here last night. I noticed automatic Tesla fire around me when it started. They really need to fix that gun, it's ruining events. Happened to me in Radiation rumble also, again with Tesla fire around me.
---
Is it a girl with red tinted goggles on?
---
That hacked 50 cal is so unreal,,it does like 140 balistic and 1400 energy damage per shot,what surprises me is that they could remove effects from the radicals mask but they cant flag and remove those weapons.
---
great find, thanks! i always wondered if they were trying to say stuff with their grunts. makes you wonder how and why the purveyor is so docile. the mole miners are certainly mysterious.
---
The Raiders offer the Ammo maker at max rep.    
---
The Settlers offer farming plots at max rep.    
---
IMO, all range char's should go for Raider. If I use another char I'll go for Settler to experience it from their POV.    
---
You can get max rep with both but make sure you do the quests for both up until the game warns you that choosing will lock you out of the quests for the other faction. Grinding dailies is annoying.
---
Tried catapulting the hubby.
---
One star rippers are available for trading candy in monster mash if I recall correctly.
---
Just started with a handmade kinda like the suppressed sound
---
Yawn! and pass! Purveyor sales suck anyway. I really enjoyed the "Purveyor" sale we had a couple of months ago. I was able to get all kinds of great items during that sale. I got a B2525 Fixer and Handmade, BE25 Handmade, BE50 Fixer and Handmade, a Bloodied Bear Arm and a BE gatling laser. It was a great sale.
---
They can. They have done it before.
---
Yeah i just meant like the legendary effects, like how two shot explosive was the meta for so long. Appreciated the advice though
---
I feel like getting perk packs as a reward is essentially the same as getting no reward for those levels. Scrap kits are also pretty useless.
---
Yup im getting 240-280 fps in doors and its literally unplayable, guess back to capped frames at 72
---
Then that's something fucked up with my Reddit is Fun app... Tried posting and said "doing too frequently"
---
So I assume everytime I tried posting it posted but still gave me that error
---
Reward was well deserved. This is definitely needed.
---
Yeh cap that, higher fps just causes issues in this game.
---
Appreciate the info... Well I'm keeping my fingers crossed. A
---
If your app is multi posting, maybe that’s a bad app to use?
---
Yeah, sucks that have built a 2500$ CAD pc to have it capped but oh well. Its only for this game
---
OOTL, who?
---
So much good stuff... Can’t wait for the scout skin, handmade skin, pump shotgun skin, and many more thing...
---
Very curious what that emote looks like.
---
It's a nuclear winter reward.  Unlocks at either level 40 or 42 I think.
---
If you want to hunt multiple keycards at a time though you will need to server hop. Once you complete the repeatable key card quest, a period of time has to pass before another cargobot spawns. If you server hop, though, you can pretty much do the quest over and over.
---
Mannequins are coming soon.
---
I dunno. Seems hard to have a good raiders camp on such manicured lawns.
---
Actually, you can grow cranberries without the massive watery bogs - [for example](http://craftthyme.com/dont-need-bog-plant-cranberries/). You just have to mix in a lot of peat to the soil. It’s actually more likely that you could grow cranberries in the garden tiles than corn, since cranberries only have 6” of roots, while corn is 12-60” depending on the variety. 
---
Though the soil for cranberries has to be so acidic you’re not going to grow anything else next to it (maybe mutfruit?) but the game ignores that anyway.
---
I have done this event so many times that my treasury note count has actually increased since Meat Week. I've cashed in 20 every day, and not done a damn thing to earn treasury notes apart from that and a couple rad rumbles/line in the sand.
---
And I STILL haven't gotten that damned mining mask.
---
Are they really people? I thought the Overseer called them creatures.
---
Sorry but that just makes sense. No place for it in this game.
---
I'm all for ditching durability altogether. A mechanic for jamming and overheating would be great, but current durability mechanic is a joke. An M-134 Minigun has a 100.000 round barrel life and 1.500.000 round system life. Ingame miniguns are broken 10 times faster, and if they are two shot explosive... well you know what happens then.
---
Are your vending machines powered up?  Are there items for sale in the machines?
---
Underrated comment
---
So am I, been way too long to have these "issues".
---
So old coal mines back in the early 1900s used to use fire to draw fresh air through a mine. Essentially they would burn a fire on one end with a “chimney” to the outside. The fire needed need oxygen to keep burning so it would pull air from the entrance of the mine. Perhaps that is what the reasoning of the fires at the mole miners holes? Edit: this doesn’t make a whole lot of since the fires are outside but like you said, maybe the mole miners need smoky air to survive? Or they are using fire to scare something away from the mine or to keep it in 
---
Also back in the early 1900s miners were paid with mine script. Basically, the coal mines owned  you and your family. So you would use script to pay for housing (which was owned by the mine company) or grocery stores (also owned by the mine company). Maybe this is why the purveyor wants paid in scrip
---
Yeah anything outside of the parameters of the legendary roll should be banned or flagged. Duped items are entirely are a lost cause.  Legit players have scores of scrap items at this point and god roll items aren’t unheard of. Not that they weren’t mostly  obtained through a endless purveyor/ Christmas present opening months back . Hand a couple players 1-10k presents and if they open something nice borrow it for dupe and bam every rare combo is in the game forever.  The fact they finally flag people for opening too many now AFTER disabling the script reward was the real joke.  That normalized legendaries across all platforms.
---
farming plots is much, much sooner than max rep. max rep is the gauss shotgun for settlers
---
It's been fine for years - so... Bye...
---
I thought they were a season reward but didn’t see on the list? Also the website was bugged, so that could be part of it. Are they going to be in the atomic shop?
---
Ok thank you so much! Time to grind
---
Yep, I did that last night. I was kind of surprised we pulled it off, I figured somebody would waste the queen before we could finish ACP.
---
Lol. I just recently unlocked it and am currently using it .
---
From what I have heard, it's the ash piles it creates.
---
Too bad there’s no content in general right now
---
You unlock the Farmable Dirt Tiles at Friendly with Foundation, not Allied. That only requires 3000 rep compared to 12,000 rep. 
---
You may be thinking of the Turbo Fertilizer.
---
I've been getting Score since completing it over a week ago.    
---
I highly doubt it's going to carry over but has anything been said about that?
---
Answered my next question haha
---
This is way easier than randomly stumbling upon them in the wild
---
Hmm, I’ll have to go back and check my notes. Perhaps they will just be a ‘freebie’.  Maybe they will be added as a plan that can drop in game.
---
I have 4k leather. Well time to donate it all lol
---
Thats awesome that you can actually *see* it in the guys hand.
---
PC strikes again!
---
Making different ammo types isn't hard at all. Especially with the perk that increases ammo made and also considering the resources to produce ammo are everywhere. But like I said man do you lol
---
I can't speak for pc or ps4 but if you hold X on xbox it should holster your weapon
---
As of right now, current rank 99 (fireplace secret door) is not available through gold bullion, so unless they change that I'd doubt glass walls/roofs would be either
---
Christ I've said this since the beginning. You want us to buy crap from the shop but if I need to sacrifice other things in my CAMP to make budget space, I won't be buying as much
---
Sorry, I meant like actually holstering them on your characters body. Like I’m Fallout 3/NV
---
Lol, bum thought people were gonna give free shit. Think twice.
---
Exactly. If the camp budget was drastically increased you sure as hell bet I would spend my my money on the atom shop. It’s hurts seeing all of these cool camp items and bundles being released but you have to put a limit on yourself because then if you buy them all you’ll barely be able to actually use them because of the budget. And yes it bothers me and many players how we have to choose our camp preference. We usually have 3 choices, defense, decoration, or resource based. It would be awesome to have all 3 at once but that it’s clearly impossible because of limitations. I know Bethesda has been working hard for further updates but they are taking an opportunity and setting it outside. I have said countless times I wouldn’t spend money on the game but if there was more budget I would’ve spent at least $20. Plus my camp is already at max budget and with the upcoming season pass camp rewards I need to make room for my personal weightlifting gym, and my power armor display hallway. It sucks knowing that when you get something new, chances are that you’ll have to get rid of something in your camp. Because for the winter I want to have a nice Christmas themed hangout area but there’s so much I can do. Again, no rush to Bethesda because of all the updates they’re working on but I’m just putting it out there
---
If they invest properly in Mole Miners, they could become a new race in Fallout universe (adding to the Mutants and Ghouls), some sort of dwarves that live in mountain zones. I think they will not let us play as any of this other races besides of human, but hte seeds are there...
---
Interesting, thanks!
---
I think the new damage model is considered part of One Wasteland yes.
---
I bought it twice so I've payed $100 total for it. So yeah, no bueno.
---
Upvote for the scorchbeast wee.
---
I have been on plenty of times during the reset and not gotten autocompleted. I only get them when I open late in the day. It’s all hit and miss
---
It's so cute!
---
I think more people play in FP so it's probably not high on their to do list
---
Thats what i thought, but there hasnt been an actual confirmation. 
---
Maybe u/Ladydevann or u/Valseek  could chime in for clarity.
---
Ammo in general isn't hard to make, but why fuss over which I should make more of, how much I should make of each, etc.  Just make all the ammo for one type of gun, have different effects for that gun and there you go.
---
I've seen it before. Someone one-shot my SBQ out of the sky after I launched the nuke and everything. Some people just want to see the world burn.
---
I don't understand using hacked guns.  My Primed Bloodied FFR LMG can already kill earl and the queen in under a minute if I get the drop on them. It's broken enough - where would be the fun in something even more powerful?
---
Thing is they removed slap damage. Also when you die after a queen your flux disappears. So unless this is a PC thing your statement is incorrect.
---
Now that would be pretty cool!
---
Huh...that makes so much more sense now why my 2shot explo 50 cal broke all the f'in time....Im pretty sire I bought about 100 fix kits thinking thats just how this game works....
---
..at rank 99. oof.
---
Was this resolved? I'm not sure if my friends quit or its still a bug.
---
Some are showing up but I know some friends are online and not showing up through Steam or [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher.
---
r/falloutlore is pretty good, and most of the users aren’t shitheads when you ask about 76
---
Do you think I can 16 lvls in time?
---
I love that back wall too. The whole setup is so nice.
---
Daily ops will be closer to what you want I think
---
True. I just feel like it wouldn’t be hard to implement considering they’ve already done it before ya know?
---
I'm not sure I have it in me this time. I completed mine weeks ago... but... damn. Again. Fml.
---
This is the only good argument for increased campsize I have seen.
---
I'm happy to share experiences!
---
 That's one of my favorite spots to play in the game. I always run down that way after I do One Violent Night and it can get crazy down there fast. I had a battle down in front of the Pumpkin House once where super mutants, scorched, ghouls, ants, and a Glowing Mothman were all involved. One of my favorite things about that area, after I do One Violent Night, I like to go check to see if there's a Sheepsquatch, [then I lure it up to the Buck's Den](https://i.redd.it/4xjbvkoxv8451.png). I keep hoping I can get it to come inside the bar, but [it just likes to party outside](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eISLXN46shUQyTZeEcHVZVT-6dh_PAhp/view).
---
Eh it's ok. It's just getting over hyped because people are just desperate for new content imo. It kinda just reminds me of the vault raids with extra steps lol
---
Weapons are a pretty good source of steel, as well, especially once you get the scrapper perk and max it out. Even though West-Tek has been nerfed to death in terms of legendaries, you can still get a few hundred steel easily from there just by looting all the dead muties and scrapping their guns.
---
I'm honestly surprised they are releasing the Season so soon. I guess this means they want to release at least part of Fractured Steel in time for those sweet sweet Christmas sales.
---
Thanks for the info. I love the look of PA, but always feel like I'm losing out on my armor perks (I just made my first bloodied build after two years resisting the hype, and it's honestly too OP for me).
---
And I already have a backpack and jetpack on my back, I think I'd look awkward with another object on me anyways.
---
Thought I'd come back and admit I was wrong.  I did have pacifist off.  Been playing with it on now.  I noticed when I do scorched earth how wild some of my firing is.  No doubt I must have shot the other player.
---
wasnt referring to you specifically, just talkint about in general
---
Following this post so that when u/killasqueeze shares that information about what we will have for daily/weekly challenges ***during the one week gap between seasons***, I am also informed.
---
except for if you read my post it says i read today's ITV (i would say that's keeping informed about this game) I asked a question about something that they said they were working on at the beginning of the first season on the SCORE board.
---
Pickett's Fort with woodchuck is my go to! It has a few huge wood piles. You can also just take a walk across the toxic valley there are logs every 5-10ft
---
100%. 
---
I showed a level 470 how to move stuff along different axis in workshop mode (xbox: hold place, then use right stick/shoulder buttons etc). 1000+ hours, tons of camps, he had no idea. 
---
The only reason I knew was because I built a ton in FO4, and even then, I originally learned it from a youtube comment(!)
---
Yea, i thought there was supposed to be a 2 week break in between. I was figuring sept 22, not complaining though.
---
Anyone else think the new power armor is ugly af?
---
Bethesda, 10 weeks is not mid-December. 
---
Also, no mention of the auto-complete bug? WTF
---
Nukashine... I have a CAMP with all my materials and a shine shack and I just can't keep up with demand.
---
To craft Ultracite Ammo, would be my guess.
---
Which is what I guessed, but that’s not the official answer. 
---
Season One ends on Sep 8. 
---
Season Two starts on Sep 15.
---
I've rolled 4 myself.    
---
My first two are really good. Both are three star and one Unyeilding(1st roll) and Nocturnal(2nd roll). 3rd was one start garbage and the 4th I scripted. I don't remember what it had.    
---
It's similar to the Perveyor, IMO but you need more materials and script for Legendary Modules. At least you get end-game armor out it. None of the chest pieces have mods on them.
---
I assumed they were miners who didn't go on strike and then were bonded to their suits when the bombs fell. Like the suits in Big MT and the Sierra Madre.
---
The look is crazy badass. I'm not a PA user, but farming lead in my Responder PA is always fun.
---
Maybe theyll address it in the actual patch.  They dont usualy mention bugs in ITV.
---
Ooooh yea. No I agree then. Armor is a whole different ball game lol
---
My grandma called it the "backdoor scoots".
---
Yes indeed. A while back I got into a habit of always hunting one down when I started playing and sometimes as the last thing I did before signing off. You start banking lots of cards pretty quickly. Once I hit 50, I stopped. That was a long time ago and I'm only just starting to run out of that supply.
---
when you level up they often group the commando/rifleman/etc cards together so they are not in alphabetical order.
---
I use a bloodied gauss minigun too most of the time, and my friend don't bother with that for Earl. Swap to the cursed pickaxe you get from the event, pop in melee damage cards and incisor, eat all of the foods which boost melee damage (they actually stack unlike other things) and just go whack the shit out of him. It's like chopping down a really screamy tree. I hit him for 2.4k damage on a power attack to the head. You can see his health bar drop quite noticeably every time you hit. If someone keeps the wendigos off of you, you can kill him by yourself if you can survive his kick. Power armor and tick blood tequila helps, his kicks only tickle me.
---
My friend got the one charisma perk to revive with alcohol because he's got so damn much of it, he's one of those guys and can confirm that he's mostly there for the screws lol.
---
Thats the base increase for Perception? Wow, seems like it should be higher if you put your specials into perception, the compass distance is essentially useless and I don't think it actually works properly and 6% increased VATS chance seems like nothing when you consider the investment.
---
*Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel* would like to have a word with you.
---
Up to 90%, AFAIK.
---
That is quite a pitch... I especially like the 45% dmg penetration that you mentioned. Which mod is that?
---
Yall have been sleepinggg on this mod lol 😴 I used it to make myself immune to molotovs from mutants and raiders lol
---
definately try this \^\^\^\^
---
u/ladydevann  u/valseek for good measure.
---
Please someone mention the devs, lady something
---
I have a TSE laser with a beam splitter attached. That thing hits like a magic shotgun from across the map.
---
Pretty sure it must be level 42.  Personally I was grinding to hit 40 because you get the big orange large supply crate stash box.
---
There is also a male version of the icon as well which unlocks somewhere in the 30's.  Honestly a lot of the NW rewards are better than the stuff they put in the atom store.  Some of the other icons you get are not that great, but the PA and weapon skins are pretty nice.
---
It's a perk, stabilized.  For heavy weapons.  Obviously it doesn't apply for everyone, but if you use a heavy weapon without power armor, you're missing out at 45% armor pen.  To be clear the perk specifically says you have to have pa on for it to work.  I think it's a great perk.
---
Every single SBQ fight, some asshole has to turn on the BOS transponder, so everyone has to hear that message. 
---
I'm that asshole.
---
Some do like myself others don't.
---
I really wanted the glass walls/roof, but I am really really having a hard time getting myself psyched up to deal with the boring challenges for this season. Not that it’s a lot of time, but it’s just tedious.  
---
Especially when we are at the whim of bethesda on when and if we get extra challenges or double points.  
---
I’d straight up quit if it wasn’t for friends that played
---
Oh ... hahahahaha
---
Not exactly inspiring, since they've already "patched" it once and it's still affecting so many people.
---
Sounds like you had an infinitely more awesome time. I'd much rather be fighting the bosses from Doom.
---
I'd like to see a picture of this.
---
Pew Patrol was the first thing that came to mind when I saw your post. Only as a joke name tho. Or Miner Miracles.  
---
A more serious one tho: Aid Appalachia. Probably not the first choice but better than Pew Patrol.
---
I presume the "fun" is ruining it for others.
---
Duchess is an NPC with a really fat ass
---
Yes, it stacks bro.
---
I think u did good   : ^ )
---
I haven't been playing for a while and just getting back into it. With the new season coming out in a few days, is there anything reasonable to shoot for in the first season (without paying for levels) besides the ammo converter?
---
If you go to Braxton Medical, [there's a note there](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_extraction_guide). It would be cool to tie a quest to get the parts for a full skeleton model to that note somehow. Maybe finding that note generates the questline. Then, you have to go find some unmarked graves and collect the pieces to build your model, so you can begin the 'Skeleton Wars'.
---
I'm hoping that becomes a gold bullion item at teh end of the season. People would want that set because it will be really sought after
---
What do you mean? If you've ranked in the LegRun, you've seen it lol. Just imagine ALL 100 happening one after the other....
---
Ok thank you so much! I've always related to RaRa with her personality so when I saw it looked like her I just had to get it
---
Runs at about 2 fps and it pauses a few seconds at a time.  Beths needs to fix them for more then one reason.
---
I've only ever had this happen on the PTS but I definitely second the notion to move the notifications away from being dead centre in your face.
---
In fact, ALL the notifications need to be shrunken and moved. Quests, Legendaries, Score, level ups, the lot. I don't really need my view blocked when I'm in the middle of a fight.
---
What does pneumatic do again?
---
That was my point. I've seen the notifications, and they take up a very small portion of my screen. I assumed yours must be bugged if it's "taking up as much visual real estate as it can."
---
I was at an acp where it wouldn’t let anyone escape.  It was stuck, the event never ended or gave us rewards even though we killed him.  Had to fast travel out (into the radiation) then quickly fast travel to my camp.
---
It's fixed on the PTS, so it should go live when patch 22 drops.
---
Agreed! Nothing should be dead center...
---
Main reward isn’t the drops from the boss itself, it’s the rewards for the quest completing. I’m not too upset at people killing the Queen first time she lands or Earl and the Imposter within the first few seconds, I miss out on the 3 to 40 scrip sure but I still get the reward from the quest completing and it saves me ammo.
---
Now if any of these bosses guaranteed a 3* legendary drop from looting their body then in that case yeah you don’t want them to die before you can damage them... but they don’t, 90% of the time the legendary they drop is some 1* POS. Much more likely to get a 3* item from the quest actually completing.
---
N I c e
---
LMG isnt a rifle, so Fixer by default
---
I saw it last night but didn’t join
---
Not sure anything really needs to be. Of course it doesn't carry over.
---
I honestly don’t have a build. I started as a stealthy rifle, now now I’m a pa heavy working toward a vampire tank build. Unfortunately not getting much luck with the vamp fast shooting guns. I only have a vamp gat with +25 fire rate.
---
Entire sets of modded power armor 😍
---
I love the red viper armour paints, will definitely be trying to get all of those at the very least. The greenhouse is cool too, and probably fair being at level 99 to reward getting up that high.
---
It's because they just removed the Legendary slot from the Radicals mask.  You couldn't remove it from the .50 cal without removing it from every .50 cal in the game.  They would clearly need another strategy for dealing with this type of exploit and, unfortunately, it's taken them entirely too long to come up with one.
---
Well, if you are keeping up to date, you could have gone back and read older ITV from season one.
---
What they said was this. 
---
At start, everyone will be on the same path and get the same rewards. They are looking into offering more for Fallout First members. Which people speculated meaning that FO1st members will have points in the season they get offered different and better rewards. 
---
So, there you go.
---
Knowing Big B they can’t touch one without touching the other which is why I chimed in. 
---
It’s a shame the weapon dmg wasn’t a bit more. It would level the weapon field a whole lot.
---
Yeah I get this as well, but I have not completed the run yet. It will continuously cycle with pop ups for the rewards (although the reward image is blank). I use PA (those notifications don’t happen while in PA) so it’s been very difficult to try and figure out what’s causing the issue as it will only show the rare times I have to exit my PA
---
And make it bigger like the sheep squatch
---
Ye
---
Yeah, I agree with you. If they increased Camp Budget, I'd actually buy more things on the Atomic shop to put in my house, but since there's limited budget, my house is both mostly empty, and gives me no room for placing more furniture and other objects down. They'd gain way more sales if they increase camp budget and so many more people would probably buying more bundles on the atomic shop. It would be a win/win scenario if they increase camp budget.
---
Its not a small notification to begin with (least not for me) takes up about as much space as a baseball dead center of my screen. If it were to the side, I'd not care at all, but this makes it impossible to play the game. Least of all is the fact that it happens repeatedly.
---
no more than 10. 20 for super and 5-6 for diluted
---
YAAAAAAS! Great idea!!
---
I don't sell them, but 9 is cheap, when I sell themi usually charge 12 caps. I think 10-15 is a fair price. 20 is already overpriced in my opinion.
---
Sell them for a price your comfortable with.
---
Depending on the circumstances, that weapon can outright crash other players, if not the server itself, which is why they do it.  Kind of a parting "F U" when they leave.
---
Is this an old outfit?
---
Have you tried it? 
---
It was a challenge to solo it but I also didn’t try to spec into it heavily. 
---
I do agree that a “blood moon” behemoth horde event would be good. 
---
Though they would need at least 50% of the queen or Earles resistance to be worthwhile imho
---
Few days - you still got over a week and a half to go.
---
I know there is a bug that prevents the SCORE notifications from appearing while in PA, and only happen when you get out. I could't imagine having BOTH of these bugs active at the same time! Stay in your PA! :D
---
Naw it’ll just give you booze and the other junk in the provisions they handed out....
---
It comes and goes out of the atom shop.
---
You have a very messed up definition of "rifle"
---
Ok cool, looks interesting
---
Cloth challenge is already done, we won. 
---
Did try this though with the intention of donating the cloth for the challenge... Made like 250 bandannas and super duper only proc’d 50 times so I only had 50 extra cloth from sitting there for a half hour clicking the craft and scrap button. Takes way too much time to be useful, especially if you lag in the workbench menus.
---
Thank you! Definitely gonna just do some browsing around there for now before trying to jump in headfirst :p
---
I havnt changed my clothes since I started the game so poop is the least of my worries.
---
Yea it did but honestly I stopped halfway through because I got so triggered by the DPS nerf lol
---
This ^
---
Best to get ammo as 1 flux gives you between 300 and 500 caps, which will buy 300/500 ammos, which is alot more than you cqn build with 1 flux, even for the .308, which is the only prime ammo worth crafting.
---
Church
---
One of my personal favorites. To get a good look at it if you don’t have it, Meg is wearing the outfit.
---
It's not my favourite, probably won't be applying it to most armours. I think the X-01 paint sort of works though, might use that one if/when I get around to building an X-01 suit.
---
I always have the hardest time finding the high radiation fluids..
---
You say 16x the detail but the grass is still a png
---
It was always there
---
Thanks for your comnents. I am selling stimpack diluted for 6 caps, stimpacks for 9 and stimpack super for 12 atm. I have noticed some players starting to revisit on a regular basis too.
---
Yes on weekly reset I lost my weekly and dailies, but for some reason I had like 1 weekly and 2 dailies and of course 1 was the NW daily. Then the next day I lost out on my dailies again... I think Bethesda is trying to tell me something.
---
Ah ok, I’ll prob snag it next time it hits the shop hopefully 🤞
---
It's all the same mentality that drives them.  Trolls who are the heroes of their own story.
---
I explore in 3rd person and enter 1st person for combat so I'd really appreciate being able to see my holstered weapons!
---
What weapon and build were you running?
---
Didn't even know you can blow a whistle on that thing. Learn something new everyday.
---
I disagree that you can’t have a well decorated camp that is also functional.  I rotate which items I’m using in my camp.  Sometimes it’s a Raider Drug den with junk walls, eagle nests, mattresses on the ground, and a small garden so I can grow the materials I need for making booze (but all the other stuff is there too).  It even has turrets on all the walls. 
---
Other times it’s a refurbished Red Rocket. But in all cases my camps have:
---
* A few turrets
---
* All of the crafting stations
---
* Decorations
---
* Farming
---
* Water Purifier
---
* Collectron
---
* Extractor (if the location allows for one)
---
* Chicken Coup &amp; Cow
---
I watch videos of people like no respawns and he builds great camps that have all the fixings, are functional, and have all the crafting stations.  I honestly don’t know what people are doing that they are so limited on space, unless you are trying to use every single thing, every single time.
---
I wish we got that actual Mistress dress from the sprite artwork and not just the slight reskin of the tattered dress.
---
Its' why we can't have fresh undies.
---
🚨**Legitimate Improvement Alert** 🚨
---
*Code: Gold - Critically good idea*
---
⬆️ **Lets get this one to the top** ⬆️
---
Bloodied ranged weapon, fixed it for you hahah
---
“Greatly reduces the magnitude of incoming staggers” which is great against the queen’s wing swipes and the deathclaws and yao gui’s she spawns.  You’re not 100% immune to them but it’s a very noticeable difference.
---
It isn’t that great against Earle because his stomp attack and the wendigo spawns stagger you no matter what you do, even in PA
---
It's Bethesda. Wouldn't be surprised if they fucked up and it does carry over
---
Fair enough. It is annoying
---
I mean squatsh looks like he already had a party before lmao
---
Yeah I didn’t think the cloth challenge was gonna be an issue for anyone. Across 3 toons I think have 100k that just sits in my scrap box. I was looking at it more for the glass and leather challenges since the goggles offer 1:1 craft:scrap. I made about 100 or so this morning and got about 75 back. Most efficient way to grind mats? Definitely not, but for people who don’t wanna check locations for mass amounts of materials and have this outfit this is a good alternative.
---
Aye. one of my alts has enough weapons and armour to stage a revolution.
---
I saw the army floors and foundations but no walls??
---
Why tho
---
Is this update coming out on the 15th for consoles too?
---
I think this is where you are going to see the Instanced Camps really come alive. With a larger budget coming with them as well as relaxed building restrictions (hello paintings leaning against a wall????) you will see people start to go nuts!
---
Plans you already know. :p
---
The LMG is a heavy weapon, not a rifle. But if you still want to compare them the lmg has a Better dps but less modding options and can't really be used in vats. Fixer is better in stealth and vats.
---
Most useful anyways
---
Is there a video on YouTube that subtitles what the mole miners actually say? That would be interesting. I’ve seen video like that for zombies in other games.
---
Wait what? 
---
Lol what is a bad argument for increased camp size? I haven’t seen these
---
So, what would the whoopsies be then?
---
If so, lots of people are gonna be done with it in a week LOL
---
His biggest sins are copyright striking people, having some neckbeardy views, and I think bullying a fat chick back in like 2010 IIRC. He’s still a phenomenal Fallout lore youtuber, and sometimes you have to separate the content from the creator.
---
Legendary Ball Gag.
---
Want
---
Assuming so, does not say otherwise.  Other than the PTS, everything usually drops simultaneously.
---
Its called the classic jukebox because its the same design from fallout 3
---
Awesome! That was my first time so i panic when the mine was about ti collapse
---
Scout armor has an even better trick.
---
Awesome! Thank you :)
---

You get 10 caps if you sell a stimpak to robot vendor with enough charisma and/or with the bargain perk
---
Hilarious. Picture of a ghillie rifle skin and a reward description of 12 nukashines.
---
Ooh oh
---
Why the gap tho from 8th end of season 1 to the 15th start of two. Never had a game with days between seasons when it comes to game play function. Not to mention challenges will mean absolutely nothing. Just like when you cap out.
---
It was pretty fricken great ngl. Until.... ya know... the screen became about 8 pixels and I couldn't click on Earle's corpse to loot and died in the mine since I'm a slow ass PA user
---
It was most likely always there. The Purveyor probably tunnels her way to places.
---
I’ve been trying for ages to get dysentery (and the woopsies),anybody got any tips on getting infected with these!
---
:O
---
Ah glass I’m not too sure of, but you can get 300 cloth from the burned books in the Summerville house, about 100 cloth from picking up the cups and stuff at the fair, and 100 cloth from collision course in pre war money.
---
As for leather pretty much any animal drops hide, I get a ton of it when I kill the 9 Brahmin in flatwoods for steaks, so much so that it usually over encumbers me.
---
Just to tack on you can claim without hitting up the Center bench. 
---
As long as you’re in the area circle holding the build mode button will trigger a claim
---
There’s 2 periods In There!
---
Everytime we all jump into the cave I wait a second to revive all the players that didn’t realize it was such a big drop 😂
---
Ok so first of all its not the guy who i stole from that killed me. It was some other random dude. Second the "crime" that i committed wasnt exactly the worst crime ever committed. I stole 15 .38 ammo. Third, im only justifying it cause u assholes keep giving me endless shit about it. I know it was a dick move but it wasnt a big enough dick move for you cunts to constantly give me shit for it. So why dont *you* stop fucking whining
---
How could you even do that?
---
No, I would start a match, place my character in a bush in the middle-ish of the map, then do something else, like watch YouTube or play my Switch. If the circle edge moved close enough, I would scoot my character into it.
---
Sometimes if I was feeling up to it, I'd actually "play" by moving from bush to bush to last as long as possible. Did that a lot during the bonus xp weekend. 
---
Hell, I even won 4 matches hiding in bushes because everyone else died from environmental/enemy causes.
---
Not likely - all of this crap still works in PTS.
---
It's a really bad look, to nerf everyone except these exploiters, but one that Bethesda doesn't really seem bothered about.
---
It's working again :) 
---
I removed one of the items that I have for sale and added it again to the vending machine and now my camp shows up.
---
You can kill stuff faster than 1 shot?  99.9% of the mobs in the game die in 1 shot to anyone that tries.
---
Dang. I’ve been checking everywhere for cloth and donated all of mine, and that was only about 2k. How did you get 35k??
---
They wasted it all on lighting haha
---
Only explosive bait can do that on PC. They fixed or changed all the other methods. It was probably just a bunch of people with pacifist off.
---
I meant if there is anything worth trying to get besides the ammo converter
---
I personally dont really need the extra caps or the stimpacks, I just want to keep a nice atmosphere to the game where both low and high level players can afford to buy things they need to explore the wasteland. My CAMP is just a helpful spot crossing their way. Also my food products all go for 2 caps.
---
So bad but very memorable
---
I think i bought it for relatively cheap. I've had it since I was around level 50.
---
Doesn't do anything [in my experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ilsblb/hacked_weapons_in_pc_are_completely_out_of_hand/g3vcnju/). Support just gets stuck in a loop asking you to provide information you already gave them. Repeatedly...
---
I do this, I'm at a net gain of resources every run. Even  besides the screws and fiberglass
---
I use a shotgun with magic armour so I hit my 2000 damage threshold on earl in one shot (then stop BC killing him too fast is a dick move) the proceed to be the resident healer and protector. I use 20 stims on me and 20 on the team (max) and I pick up 60 from the meatpiles. I burn 250 shotgun shells and pick up 2500. I get away with 50 radaways every time.
---
Even with repairing my shotgun 25 times a day I'm raking it in, long live (and keep dying) Earle!
---
Unfortunately no, i wanted do the same thing hanging from my roof garden farmable tiles but no dice.
---
It also prevents damage against scorchbeasts screech attack
---
There are macros for PC people use and slow roll xp overnight. By joining matches constantly. 
---
You can sometimes tell who they are in game because often they jump up and down incessantly. 
---
Imho the power cost IRL isn’t worth the XP
---
Ghouls have somehow evolved the ability to fling rad worm parasites through the air. Because I've been in plenty of fights where the ghouls never actually hit me, and I kill them before they get within arms length.
---
"You have Contracted Rad Worms" everytime.
---
Yes, and the way it works the more you have the stronger it is. 4 pieces gets you 80% and 5 pieces gets you 90% which is twice the reduction of 80%. Imagine a 10lb weapon, with 80% reduction it loses 8lbs leaving you with 2 lbs. With 90% it loses 9 lbs leaving you with 1lb, which is half the weight compared to 2lbs. I would fully commit to 5 pieces
---
WTF did i just watch? o_o
---
I sell Diluted for 10, regular for 15 and Super for 40, and I can't keep them in stock
---
Shit i missed cloth. I Have so many i was going to turn in.
---
I am a glass canon so I usually run around getting the wendigo spawns and reviving players who are tanking Earle.
---
Omg please!!! I would def get this if they offered it
---
I will sprint as fast as I can to revive anyone. My years of playing healers in mmorpgs have trained me for this.
---
Right there with ya.
---
This might be a much smaller patch than wastelanders as far as content, but its going to be the biggest game changing patch yet IMO.
---
Meh, I guess I'm not gonna try as hard next season. Only things I like are ship in a bottle, foosball table (cause pool table ain't let you put anything on it), the greenhouse set, and the atom rewards. Chances are they make the greenhouse set sell for bullion after the fact. Even if they don't, if I get to rank 99 cool, and if I don't, well, whatever.
---
Well its a bit harder to come by ammo when A: you literally just started playing fallout 76 like a couple days ago and B: you have no idea wtf your doing cause the game is so much different to fallout 4. Cause like fallout 4, when i see a fucking lock (if i can) imma fucking pick it.
---
Considering how some people act, its appropriate.

---
All game have bugs... But Bethesda games much more so. Pretty much every game they make is a buggy POS, but it’s always a fun POS we enjoy for years to come.
---
(I remember reading the wiki years ago for NV and FO3 when something didn’t work right, here to find out each Fallout game has platform specific bugs... Some could be solved with a workaround, others you could only solve on PC with a console command. Pretty much I just learned to make a save before doing anything and reloading in hopes I don’t encounter the same bug when I try it again... But I still had fun.)
---
I once pvp'd a guy abd he turned to ash and it wouldnt let me take his loot it just said search ash pile
---
Maybe it's because it's a known issue.
---
I'm a tanky power armor build. I'll run around just shooting an explosive weapon at the ground to get agro. Then sit with 10-12 wendigos on me while I hit Earl for the kill credit. Rinse and repeat.
---
Then people wonder why I have so many screws...
---
It ain't much, but someones gotta do it for the bloodied high damage dealers.
---
This was my thought as well. Could have gotten to rank 87 or higher and *then* spent Atoms to hit Rank 100. 
---
I personally wouldn’t have spent Atoms until this weekend if I hadn’t hit Rank 100. More bang for the buck. And this way, I have a net profit of 2000 Atoms.
---
Will probably be Atomic Stop I reckon!
---
I just go to colossus when it comes up, no need to launch the nuke yourself to finish the quests
---
Wow this is so creative!
---
I'm on ,PS4, so outside of something like a Turbo Controller and Rubber Band, I don't really have that luxury.
---
The last thing I would need is to leave Fallout 76 unsupervised with auto-button pressing so it could crash and let a controller go haywire with my system.
---
Sure, but I wanna do it at least once.
---
I hope we get more lore for the mole miners too.
---
I also enjoy their ascetic, I wish we could wear some of the things they wear... or at least similar things.
---
Right, which is fine. It's good that new players are coming to the game. But you're gonna learn pretty quick that you don't wanna be stealing from other players...even if it is just measly .38 ammo.
---
To be blunt, not really.  There are a few things for bragging rights, that you finished it, but other than that, there's almost nothing I use on a daily basis or anything.
---

---
 &gt; Wow this is so creative!
---
Morgantown, IMHO.
---
The inconsistency and dark patterns in this games UI / UX design kills me as a designer
---
Yes but I’m finding that trying to ally with the faction you didn’t side with takes a very very long time.  That little neighborly progress bar seems stuck a little over halfway LOL
---
Oh.  
---
There's a Turbo Fertilizer?  
---
I just checked and my mistake&gt; Samuel only has the first two rewards. After getting the next level, I think I'm done with them for awhile.
---
Hmm, sounds interesting
---
Huh, really? Maybe its just in my own world but I find that pretty weird.
---
Ah that sucks!! Thanks for the answer tho!
---
Yeah no doubt it would cook your hardware to death lol let alone potentially purchase shit you didn’t want
---
I get that but like it was a tiny bit of .38 ammo and all of u mfs (maybe not you specifically but a lot of people) keep giving me.endless shit for it. Like cmon its not that big a deal
---
yeah, hubs is a coder and this game makes him itch at times lol
---
This char is a Stealth Rifleman.  
---
All the Rifle perks. Sneak maxed and my gear would do better than the chinese stealth armor anyway.
---
I know what the old one said, that's why i said i remember them talking about giving FO1 something during SCORE in the future and i was just curious if they were going to implement anything in the second season.
---
\-- Per the FAQ “A: We may add extra Fallout 1st bonus rewards in the future, but want to focus on getting Seasons in the game first and seeing your thoughts.” 
---
Since that was season 1, i don't think its insane to ask if it is coming in season 2
---
No, that's not true - perk packs will be one of the most coveted rewards because they push you towards ranking up your legendary perks.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
It's both. Pen is a bug, sound level is a shit design choice
---
Probably they will do an Armor Ace atom store bundle and you'll have to buy the skins that match the backpack.
---
Depens what you kill mostly and loot, anglers - adhesive i believe like snallygasters/crickets - acid
---
Yep. Did this yesterday. Hopped on a server. Joined a team and saw that they were at the mine. Fast traveled to teammate and was placed in the event at the beginning. Quick jog down the mine and had Earl in my crosshairs for the second half of the event.
---
I didn't, but the person above me did! I was wondering that myself!
---
Maybe you need to re read your post, and realize what you were asking and how your own words come across. 
---
You’ve made assumptions, you misread. You seem upset people pointing it out.
---
This should have been fixed, can you DM me your username and a ticket number?
---
More worried that it would start messing with other apps.
---
It's not the stealing, it's that you came here asking how to remove wanted after you stole from someone...while acknowledging that you stole the ammo willingly. All I'm gonna say is, steal and deal with the consequences. That's it.
---
I'm a bit uninspired by the bulk of those rewards. Maybe I'll sit this one out, and hopefully buy the greenhouse building set from one of the factions for bullion if it ever becomes available.
---
While that is true, you can only have 1 collectron at a time.
---
Yes but I’ll caution you - you **CAN** carry so many weapons it will slow the game down when interacting with inventories to a unbelievably grinding halt. 
---
EG: If you get lockup’s on weapon switching or pipboy or craftbenches it’s probably from your 125 guns and 50 pieces of armor plus your aid plus misc plus notes.
---
Yup me and Todd run one every night
---
No doubt
---
I'll ask about this!
---
They always reminded me of the Ghost People of the Sierra Madre, but that’s probably just because of the suits.
---
I already said what I knew. It had nothing to do with in between seasons. You guys are pretty damn touchy. I'd expect more from a community that likes Bethesda games.
---
Thank you very much! :)

---
 &gt; I'll ask about this!
---
And in adventure we found multiple ways around it, you getting upset about survival has no ground to stand on. Go make some explosive bait, to me half the fun is cracking the shell of a house to kill them. Like I said, people found multiple ways around this.
---
That’s why I said the lore is great but the person is garbage.. I’m not a fan of bullies
---
I gave 250 cloth, I helped lol
---
Yeah they have no idea how to balance a game and they said they’re not making the game harder but with the nerf and higher-level enemies? That clearly is contradictory.
---
Not  unless you buy ranks. Ends next tuesday.
---
Dang I was feeling good about my 14k cloth till I read that... I earned mine too I guess.
---
They could be the counterpart to Wendigos, but rather than being hungry for meat they are territorial, once human miners but deteriorated and the heat from the burning mines sealed their clothing. If you look at Murmghr she has yellow claw-like hands similar to that of a wendigo
---
You're fucked
---
Pretty screwed. You have 5 days to finish lol
---
I am glad that they decided to remove stimpaks as rewards. Who came up with that idea anyway............................................ ... .. .  
---
Or were they just place hodlers on PTS?
---
you will not complete it without buying atoms. Won't even come close.
---
It would go a long way toward saving budget space if they let you prefab a full bobblehead stand or magazine rack (one for each type of magazine collection). That way each individual bobblehead/magazine doesn't take up all my budget space (if you want mixed magazine racks, then you'd still have to deal with the current problem, unfortunately). I don't even need x2 or x3 budget space for my camp. Just another 20-50% would go a long way!
---
Some decent stuff. Need that new theme pic to be wallpaper friendly though.
---
Wasn't there supposed to be a power armor display stand? What happened to that?
---
Yeah figured as much, and I doubt 1170 atoms will help at all.
---
If you stack lunchboxes and join the public event or building team and use the lvl 3 inspirational perk, and farm XP... Playing nonstop, it's possible. Have you done all the weeklies?
---
You mean the level scaling so your low level friends do similar damage? Yes, that is part of One Wasteland.
---
Yea it sucks. I have any idea for a garden area but I'd have to use the tiles. I was really hoping the various trees would place on them.
---
Leader bobblehead is good too
---
Looks like that will be an Atom Shop item.
---
Abusing explosive bait is griefing  , i wqnt to pvp not be a griefer.  I am done talking to you now

---
 &gt; Oh! yes that is also part of One Wasteland.
---
Jetpack is kinda nice.
---
I actually came to ask the opposite question.  I thought there was originally slated to be about a month between seasons and didn't know why that changed.
---
**New rule!**
---
Anyone who rants about fallout already tenuous canon gets shot out of a literal cannon.
---
so "looking into it" means not gonna happen in your opinion and Im "upset" for asking if it is coming....ok
---
Was more refering to how damage is now being calculated additive on the PTS rather than multiplitive like it is on the live game.
---
Dude, the question was about any content in between seasons. Not content during the next season. 
---
You corrected someone that wasn’t wrong. And I thought that meant you might have new information. 
---
I’d expect someone that likes Bethesda games to be more attentive to detail.
---
  *"We’ve also been reading feedback from players who don’t have quite as much time to play each day as they would like"* 
---
This clearly has a typo I think they meant: 
---
   *"We’ve also been reading feedback from players who don’t have quite as much time to play each day as* ***we*** *would like"*
---
Well he said 300+ in 1 run,  ill would say close call then.
---
So to get this amount i suppose you must loot also during the fight? 
---
Because i did it twice after Earl was killed and manage to loot Just around 120-130 screws each time!
---
They're talking about the new way damage is calculated
---
Was there anything even remotely of value from this legendary run?
---
5 days left in the current season.
---
I gave .25k
---
Just making sure I didn't overlook anything. Ammo converter is very unique, but nothing else stood out as essential.
---
I agree with that, but a lot of people haven't gotten Arktos stuff, so when I see it in vending machines it's still worth upwards of 15K. And do you really think running Wes Tek over and over is going to get you better rewards?
---
I never eat iggy on a sticcky.
---
I was actually in there with a few people last night. We were still only able to get 1 Friendly to rank 3, the other 2 died.
---
As we can assume every single person using fixer is using it from stealth, it will actually out dps LMG by quite a big margin (by over 50% more on bosses), which can't be used from stealth. EDIT: Even rifleman stealth build with fixer is better in dps by over 15% on bosses.

Actually, she's wearing [floral print yellow gloves](https://i.gyazo.com/76e292957373a947f1ccfbac8f359d82.png), though most Mole Miners seem to just be barehanded.
---
I had that too, had to open in a incognito window, clearing out cookies or such would probably fix it
---
Gave my friend some fusion cells when he was out of ammo on like all guns he proceeded to use a tesla and I just went NOOOOO as he proceeded to thanos snap my frames.
---
Pffft...no respectable raider would camp there.....
---
Oh yeah. I always thought they were Yellow, must have just been the unloaded textures
---
Fireplace door, Ammo converter, clean sink, jangles stein, jangles backpack are my favorites.
---
Well, walls are definitely cosmetic so I'm not sure why people think they would be available later.
---
As a 40+ year old guy, the 80s G.I. Joe vibe is sucking me in.... Damn you Beth!
---
I also fully expect a PSA after every SCORE rank up.
---
We set the market.    
---
I'm not rich and at most have had at least 13,000 caps. I hate going under 10,000.    
---
Many items are so common in the world that pricing them in the thousands is ridiculous.    
---
I don't sell Stimpacks. I sell mostly plans, mods, and lower level gear.    
---
An item should be priced in the real world and fantasy based on supply, demand, materials used to make it, how common, rare, and expensive that items is to make, time and labor, and enough of a profit margin.    
---
Everyone needs Stimpacks. Sadly you can't lock a vendor machine by levels so some 300+ can come in and take them all. It is a free market.  IMO, level 2-10 char's could be helped with free items and then after they choose from a vendor.    
---
9 caps seems good. I tend to find a lot of them just by playing the game. I might have crafted 20 since the game came out.
---
I could overlook all the bugs and glitches, but the inability to solve the hacked weapon problem is why I quit playing. I like to PVP with pistols and other legitimate shit, but every other PVPer out there has duped energy weapons or other hacked bologna.
---
For me it’s likely the “armoury” is now getting a greenhouse vibe
---
Thanks, issue seems to have resolved itself after a PC restart. Appreciate the response though.
---
That sounds like a good price point for those.    
---
Do you have a fast, easy way to farm the mats for them?
---
Oh! yes that is also part of One Wasteland.
---
I think the tinkers bench is good as is, but the chem bench defo sucks ass and needs a reskin
---
Im on PS4, don't know if that changes things
---
Thank god I wear the marine wetsuit.
---
Where to donate
---
Jokes on you I dont wear pants
---
I'm sure they'll all go on sale at some point after the legendary run
---
There's also a big stack behind a house in Helvitica by the Fasnacht parade's first stop.
---
Awesome, thanks for the response on that.
---
Definitely.
---
Did you look at it on your phone?
---
Feels good right?
---
The outside of the Rusty Pick was crawling with Muties before it went to the Purveyor.
---
I always considered it a Super Mutant dragster...😄

Sounds reasonable.
---
I use a mule. They only know fixer plan and bear arm plan. My main only rolls modules (currently) and they roll weapons
---
you bet your sweet ass I am.
---
There is a souvineer sloth plushie already in the game. I know it's not a mega sloth, but still cool.
---
No it's part of his dodgeball team with Blade, Blazer and Fran Stalinovskovichdaviddivichski. Team of commies if you ask me.
---
I hate to say it since it's completely out of place here, but...  
---
Those people in point 3?  Trumpers.    
---
Sorry in advance to my karma
---
My silly brain gone "Haha, legendary sofa"
---
I believe 2 of the "better" rewards are supposed to make their way to the bullion vendors eventually, but i cannot recall which items. I want to say chicken coop and fireplace door? Not sure though. PTS players could confirm.
---
bethesda cant just give her cake and expect us not to notice
---
I think they’re all the same once you do their quest line. Every ally has a vendor companion.
---
In your post you said something to help fallout first members along in the SCORE board. That implies you’ll get a benefit in gaining score. But Bethesda never says that, they said extra rewards. 
---
In the future. But right now they are just focused on getting the seasons into the game. Seasons with an s at the end. Which reading means that they want to get at least two or more seasons under their belt before they start working on giving fallout first extra bonus rewards.
---
So you’re asking something they already answered. You aren’t getting extra in season 2. Season 3? Who knows, since they haven’t said when.
---
Legendary sofa. Sometimes you sit on it. Sometimes... it sits on YOU!
---
This. I had an event fail because there were a couple of players over level 100 literally not contributing anything to the fight and just crouching in out of the way locations. I would much rather have lower levels that participate than higher level folks hoping to get free experience.
---
I think for a lot of players the main reason to have a maxed out Beckett is to get both the Blood Eagle jacket outfit and The Final Word .50 cal.
---
that and the glass house is really the only good things in there and they're both late into it :/
---
Buffout, modified liquid nitrogen pumps and Tryhard Boots.
---
They put the only thing I want at Level 99. Those MFs.
---
Until then, just put it on your ally.
---
I wonder if the weight station gives you a buff for using it, or if it's just random junk to place around your camp.
---
Yes can’t wait
---
Eh, ammo converter is only really useful item. Everything i thought i wanted was just oh, not great. Def wouldnt spend atoms on it. The 3rd leg had the worst collective rewards IMO.
---
Beckett's my least favorite out of all the possible allies.
---
Kill the fucking adds!
---
nope. nothing they could possibly offer to force me through this bs again.
---
Yes, however I'm talking about going above and beyond a "normal" camp. No offense, but that's a typical camp. I'm referring to people who want to take things to the next level and who would be willing to spend some money to get an amazing camp. Yes the budget is fine for a decent sized, okay decorated camp with basic defense, but not for truly amazing camps. Besides, who is this hurting? Literally nobody. I'm not asking for a bigger camp space, just more budget.
---
Not the companions without a story line. Raider punk, wanderer, settler old man dont have vendor.
---
It was mentioned here that they were going to remove the debuffs from not eating and drinking with One Wasteland: [https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/](https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/)
---
&gt;Another big change for One Wasteland is the removal of *Fallout 76’s* negative survival elements. As it stands right now, if you don’t eat or drink for a while in the game, you’ll find yourself struggling on with a heavy debuff. But in One Wasteland, there will be no penalties, only bonuses for those who take the time to quaff and scarf all they find. “We want the flavor of survival without the drudgery,” Gardiner said.
---
Is this still happening? As it seems unclear right now.
---
Perk packs are gonna be sought after once Legendary perks drop.
---
So you're mad they made changes to make bases invincible, but you didn't want to use the workarounds, instead you complain about it. It's not griefing if you're in PvP...... And you proved my point about not enough PvPers actually playing the mode, instead THEY wanted to whine about it just as much as the adventure mode players trying to get the extra xp. Edit: It's almost like there's a PvP game mode that doesn't have to do with base building, it's called Nuclear Winter! Just straight PvP, exactly what you want.
---
Doubt it.
---
Hell yeah after seeing the rewards.  Let me at it
---
See what the rewards are and go from there. If nothing looks too appealing take a break and play something else. If we get more double events it gives leeway on the run.
---
Beckett screams like a psycho when defending my camp, I love it. I’ll be tinkering in my house and hear Beckett do some battle cry in the background and gunshots shortly after, defending my camp.
---
Ammo is huge.  250% increase.  Poison resistance is huge, burning resistance is good, slightly less so with fireproof though.
---
You go to Atlas Observatory. It’s the grey dome on the map next to Sons of Dane Compound on the map.
---
A week. Yeah. Got anything else you need to take care of?
---
I’m not sure on the BoS Collectron but I have the Raider version and he’s hilarious. He always talks about wanting to do chems, drink or how it was more fun to work for Rose killing people haha. He can collect weapons and ammo or chems and alcohol. Pretty sweet!
---
Ah
---
Special ones will be the most beneficial ones for sure.
---
I personally will max out the stealth damage one and then dump rest of the coins on specials.
---
Ammo factory will go to my alt character that will become my ammo maker. As why on earth would i use my mains limited perk coins on something that won't affect me 100% of the time? You don't see people running around with ammosmith and super duper right now..
---
Rest of the legendary perks to me are pretty mediocre. And don't bring anything meaningful to the table. We have survived the game for nearly 2 years without resistances etc.
---
EDIT: I can max 3 cards and have the rest at rank 1. Without sacrificing my swap perks for different builds. So i will have max rank stealth damage perk and 2 maxed specials + 3 rank 1's = 13 extra perk points to my build. That will open up so many possibilities to building ones character. Like for example proper 2 weapon type build (like commando + heavy gunner) if you want. The special ones are too good to pass by.
---
Prob tech related junk like fiber optics and laser weapons
---
We're Bethesda players. We wouldn't be here if we had attention to detail mindsets.
---
I never put my whole stock of something in at one time just because I sell cheap and some will clean me out most likely to resell. Stims I usually keep around 10 and restock when I'm at my camp if needed.
---
If I were to hazard a guess, Mole Miners are indeed employees of Garahan and Hornwright who after the war were trapped in their mines and workplaces. A combination of heat, radiation and exposure to Ultracite likely caused mutations and is the reason they are hunched over and are so aggressive. 
---
If anything the Mole Miners have similarities with the Skaven in Warhammer Fantasy: A mostly aggressive subterranean race that views anything not itself as plunder and possibly food sources, since we don't know what they eat.
---
Another thing to note is that Mole Miner's seem to really have a common hatred for their employers as exemplified by the attacking of the Miner Bots in Lode Bearing, their attacks on the Strike Breakers and of course Breach and Clear too. Oddly though despite their disdain for their pre war careers, they still follow the social structure they had, like Foremen and Supervisors being leaders.
---
Hell yeah, unlike the lame ass space man theme of the first season, this one is military themed. G.I. Joe VS Commies. Looking forward to it so much I’d be okay with immediately jumping into it instead of a 2 week break.
---
(And I’ve already beaten the first season, may as well beat the other two.)
---
Patch 22 comes September 15
---
Edit wrote wrong date...:p
---
Synths, but without realizing it . ...
---
Yeah I can see the ammo one being a first pick for many (especially heavy builds). That and one level of survival shortcut seems to completely cut out the need to eat/drink (unless I’m misunderstanding how it works). Would there ever be a need/justification in maxing that one out I wonder?
---
September 15th
---
Because "Why cant we.." is the unofficial slogan of 76.
---
I dumped Beckett because his bar seemed to offer zero advantage other than take up space. After all I did for the guy, he still wouldn’t give me a discount. I rock Final Word all the time, so grateful for that, but Beckett, my dude, don’t stand there babbling about how great a friend I am and try to charge me 10 caps for a drink.
---
Nice post 👍🏼 some interesting season 2 cosmetics, ship in a bottle, train set and Bobblehead table soccer! 
---
No fireworks..
---
Does it stack with perk card assuming it doesnt go over 90%?
---
Yep, you HAVE to have luck of the draw with gunsmith to make it be kinda near par in that regards. But yeah like the cost of use for laser weapons is super high for such an weak output. (outside of shooting the limbs off robots with tormentor and beam splitter)
---
just hoping the BoS brings some nice new laser weapons along with them (preferably the classic fallout's Wattz 1000/2000).
---
Not into bloodied build, using explosion shotgun to lure a ton of wendigo and get loot.
---
You can always use an alt as ammo maker and save your coins for things that affect you 100% of the time, not just when crafting. The resistances imo are very mediocre. We have survived without them nearly two years, why would we now spend our limited coins on them? Do you die that often than you feel like you will benefit from them enough to warrant the cost?
---
If you're going to take it, max it out... eventually.  No reason not to.  The only thing legendaries are limited by are number of spaces.  You can max all 4 out.
---
I would love some more Mole Miner lore. Thanks for posting this.
---
I've had to rearrange a lot in my CAMP to fit the new stuff
---
The theme is wack, but some of the items are cool. I really dug the first season theme comparatively. Too bad the wall mount of the game boards don't show anymore and sink into the walls.
---
Perk cards dont affect the weight of weapon mods, but the legendary effect does. So I think they do stack but not in a way that is easy to see
---
so what happened to the armor/PA displays?
---
I absolutely agree. I think my reasoning for the x2-3 increase was to compensate for the issue of bobbleheads, magazines, gunracks, displays, etc. taking up an absurd amount of budget.
---
Yes I’m likely to max out ammo and then start working on the special ones. They offer so much utility what with the ability to swap out cards. I was honestly surprised to see Bethesda include them as, to me at least, they completely overshadow everything else.
---
Dude, I love your post about the Mole Miners, but you left out a little detail. Some Mole Miners hold onto children toy.
---
Leveling to 200+ on a second character just to make ammo seems like a huge waste of time.  Dying instantly to poison sucks.
---
Super Stimpaks I get alot from events and quests like Nuke Silos and Forbidden Knowledge. Regular Stimpaks I get from just exploring, quests and making them from the tick blood and blood packs.  And Treasure Maps. Diluted not so much, I used to use them and sell whatever I get.
---
Just one week of rest.
---
After I apply the +15 bonus from drinking the Tea, It feels that V.A.T.S. is more consistently at a 95% hit chance. That is with my base Perception being maxed at 15 on my bloodied rifleman character (the character I got all the requirements to get +15 from  Sweetwater Special Blend on) and also having more Perception from 2 pieces of unyielding armor and other mutations like eagle eyes and herd mentality. When in a team I am usually running around with 25 or more perception (depending on time of day or my current health, or if I have teammates or not) but if I feel like V.A.T.S. is missing a lot, I Pop one of the Sweetwater Special Blend I have on me, and it seems to make more shots land in V.A.T.S. but that is without testing, just my observation from general play with this setup.   
---
:TLDR   
---
\- V.A.T.S. seems more consistent, but would have to do testing to confirm it, just feels like it is from my general play with this setup, could totally be a placebo, but I don't believe it to be
---
I can see Take one for the team becoming standard with the blanket damage nerf coming
---
I believe that the Ash heap is on fire likely due to the coal mines being set ablaze by the nukes perhaps?  I'm not real knowledgeable about it, but I believe that coal mine fires can burn for decades...the Centralia mine fire here in the US has been burning since some time in the 1960s - though I'll admit I don't know much more about that fire except that I've heard it is still burning.
---
I'd recommend it as you only get 2 minutes when you kill him and you may die when he dies so (also, don't worry about that time too much as it spawns you outside anyway)
---
So the special cards push the special up past 15 right? What is the cap?
---
Anything that was utility so ammo machine/ chicken coop, lunchboxes will be bullion, anything cosmetic isn't.
---
&gt;You essentially have to choose between heavily guarded camp, a practical (ammo converters, farming, collectrons, etc.) camp, a large and mostly empty camp, or a small and very well decorated camp.
---
I mean, you said this, which made it come across that you can’t achieve those things in a single camp.  And that’s where I was disagreeing.  I would also disagree that some (Many?) of the existing camps are  “amazing”.  There are plenty of camp showcase videos out there that show some astounding build for CAMPS that make good use of the space and budget in such a way that you’d think they glitched to get that extra space. 
---
My raider camp is not small.  It’s not sparse.  I’m built along all of the edges of my camp. All of my walls have decoration.  The main house is two floors and it’s decorated.  I mean, at the point it’s at, adding more is simply adding clutter for clutter sake.
---
Unless your definition of amazing is reliant on the number of atom shop items a person can cram into a camp.
---
&gt;Besides, who is this hurting?
---
Primarily load times,  it’s bad enough when shopping to fast travel to a camp and get stuck waiting for things to load so you can actually go up the flights of stairs that the person decided to have to get to their vendors.  Every item in the camp has to have it’s X/Y/Z coordinates saved, in addition to other stats such as the current durability, if wallpaper is attached, etc.
---
That said, I’m wasn’t arguing that the idea is bad or whatever, if you want to spend money on it, more power to You.  Rather, I just don’t think people are as shoe-horned in as people complain about.
---
We’re also supposed to get instanced camps with bigger budgets down the road, so the answer may be on the way (and preferably free)
---
I am pretty sure that mole miners were human miners that got trapped in their suits during the bombing. They had ghoul DNA explaining why they could survive radiation and don’t need to breathe. They can’t see properly which is why they use close range weapons and are are scared of strangers that don’t represent the brown balls that they see each other as. The suit got melted into they’re skin sealing of their ability to do many things like see properly, hear properly and speak without just grunting. That is my theory
---
Yeah, there are a few rewards that I want (like the rank99 glass walls).
---
you clearly don't use an two-shot explosive gun, because I have to repair mine at least once per play session, more if I do SBQ/earle
---
I'm going with 4 SPECIAL, since it gives me enough points to have everything I want, plus, having 76 total Perk Points to use feels fitting.
---
I believe the cap is still 15. So you can max out a special if it’s at 10 by level 50, but not otherwise.
---
He also doesn’t have painfully annoying dialogue.
---
Forgive me, but what does that one do again?
---
They are a huge issue and the players who are willing to abuse them are also a massive problem. Bethesda needs to get far tougher on these things and exploits. It's already greatly tarnished the game and its reputation.
---
Red armor paint... come on guy!
---
With 3 fully upgraded commando perks, 5* adrenaline, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, ballistic bock, small gun bobble, overdrive then psychotats you will do more damage. I get almost 300 on a non-VATs crit with my b25/25 fixer.
---
I need me a fo76 prince albert
---
bethesda doesn't care too much about hackers, they are looking for new ways to nerfs things so you grind more and get the illusion of content.
---
Mond blown.
---
Enemys take 10,20,30,40% more damage after attacking you when your on a team
---
I haven't really cared to look at them yet but does anyone know if they benefit anything for pvp?
---
Sorry, I wasnt trying to call out level 70s in particular. That's more against the guys who make post saying "I was at ACP with three 50+ players and three  lower levels, and we lost because of the lower levels." I really dont have an issue with anyone there because I know it will get done just by me being there. I just don't like that people who arent capable of succeeding it apparently trying to dictate who should be able to show up. 
---
Finding a nice group of people can be difficult, but when you do, the game becomes much more fun. It did for me at least.
---
Are you running adrenaline and any other DMG boosting perks?
---
This is precisely what I mean. Situational bonuses vs constant benefit. Also bravo on that idea btw. 76 special points dies indeed sound very fitting.
---
Wonder how one wasteland and will be taken. Sure the damage reduction will get some time to get used to but in the long run it'll help the devs make damage changes.
---
Enemies take 40% more damage if they damage you. It's pretty damn good. Have to be on a team though and everyone would get the benefit.
---
Ah yes. Thank you! I was just reading it on the ITV article.
---
"Next, we’re adding a number of last Season’s rewards, like Lunchboxes, the Ammo Converter, and Chicken Coop, among others, to Gold Bullion vendors. This will give players who missed these items during The Legendary Run another chance to snatch them up."
---
Go to pricketts fort with wood chucker
---
Move up to the deep, dark woods and i will then visit you on a rainy, stormy October day.
---
The dupers literally were giving them away to spread their cancer in the game.
---
Probably a lot more casually than Season 1. Most the rewards I’m interested in are level 50 and below minus the final Stein in the bundle at the end. 
---
But I also said I wasn’t gonna care about season one at all, and I then proceeded to deliberately go through the whole thing, so we’ll see lol
---
You’re confusing the players with the developers. 
---
It’s our attention to detail that allows us to notice discrepancies.
---
are you soloing Earle or fighting him in a group? because that sounds about right for a public server.
---
in private I get about 130 per head shot with a handmade. 200 per crit, 250 with a B50. no chems.
---
Oh wow, is that at max level? Also does it stack with others in public teams? Sounds like one to bear in mind for sure.
---
How long was season 1? I would assume it would be the same
---
Chinese using Google translate
---
Yeah, I'm just an okay player, I think.  I probably need to put on dodgy, among other things.

I'm pretty sure there are bots that downvote everything.

Start at vault tech ag center and head east along the dry river bed. With woodchucker you can get 300-400 in less than 5 minutes.
---
It's way less than 200+ levels. And i'm sure most of us have alts already. We need 300 perk coins to max one card. And we get 2 coins for each rank/card. That alone comes to lv150 and i didn't calculate the card packs we get every 5 levels (which would bring the level needed well below lv100). And you can scrap every card on such alt. Even if you make a new character for this purpose it takes less than a week to level it.
---
Dying with poison sucks, but honestly how often does that happen to you? Do you need to spent limited coins on that? Especially when dying in this game is meaningless. For the same 300 coins you can get 5 specials. Which can be used anywhere on your build.
---
This is the only donation drive I’ll be upset if we don’t reach.
---
So what are they going to do with the daily and weekly during that week where there is no season?
---
For me, it was worth it to get to the Gauss Shotgun.
---
Sounds damn good
---
Except on PC, where 2xp means every cheater is bringing out their alt accounts that aren't rank 100+ yet
---
I'll be running Ammo Factory, Master Infiltrator, Survival Shortcut, What Rads, and probably Funky Duds.
---
Running a PA full health heavy gun build, so the QOL perks seem a bit more favorable than the SPECIAL stat increases. And What Rads is pretty decent. And Funky Duds eliminates one of the few things that hurt in PA.
---
Yes.
---
They are going to make some items from this season available with bullion, ie, chicken coop. So I imagine that after the season is over you will be able to get the greenhouse stuff with bullion too.
---
Not a PvPer so can’t really say for sure. I’d imagine your build could benefit from additional special points though.
---
Concrete.
---
Spend Cash On Ranks Eventually
---
I've noticed no difference in numbers public vs. private. I do notice difference depending on perks being shared and such. But my numbers are the same in my private server as a public server.
---
That's max yeh, can't answer your stacking question though sorry, I'm sure someone else can or when it's live we'll find out pretty quickly.
---
Big facts.
---
The thing about their appearance at Breach and Clear that interests me is that they don't attack the Motherlode itself, and just attack whoever there trying to get at it. Granted, this may be a dev oversight or just something they didn't see a need to implement.
---
I would also say Ultracite likely had a role in mutating them, given their mutations appear to be fairly convenient and Ultracite causes more or less spontaneous mutation in some cases. 
---
Given their usage of Mole Rats, including for leather, I think they likely farm them in some capacity for food, possibly alongside mushrooms.
---
On a final note, I think they might be "learning" or something along those lines, given Treasure Hunters wear entirely custom masks, with goggles and face protection alongside their relatively clean garb. It'll be interesting to see if things develop.
---
Now just imagine if this game had “smell-o-vision” ...all the wonderful odors you would come across while playing in the wasteland.
---
After it happened to me the third time I set an alarm on my phone reminding me to log out at 8:55am.
---
Oh thats fucking awesome. I need some cards back into luck. WOOHOO
---
The SPECIAL legendary perks will act like a block of points for that one stat. It won’t increase the maximum, it just saves you some points to spend elsewhere. The cap is still 15.
---
Oh, sweet summer child.
---
How was that for a TIL? ;)
---
are you sneaking though? it's only relevant if you're sneaking. sneak multipliers don't trigger if your target is in combat with anything else.
---
I've heard this befor .needs fixing
---
Yeah, it's really a constant work in progress. My advice is reach out to folks and ask what works and doesn't work. This community is highly knowledgable. I'm level 540 and I still tinker with my build. And it wasn't even long ago where I realized I had to constantly press triangle to make my vats crit hit every time. :) Also a good reference is YouTube especially Captain Noob and Angry Turtle...
---
That sounds like a great setup. I’d forgotten about Funky Duds! That one does also sound very useful. I believe it works with 5 pieces of PA also. Is that right?
---
This is a classic reddit thread.  Correct answers aren’t nice, downvote!
---
Less than a week to level to 150. We must be playing a different game.
---
Does anyone know if the survival drugs perk drug can be dropped or traded?
---
ya know what...I love the fact that Bethesda is just shoveling content out. To make sense of it all I've come to accept that not all content is meant for all users (me). I'm never going to see it all. There are soooo many inside jokes that I've come to love the sheer amount of updates, skins, storylines, etc. It's actually pretty dope.
---
Oh god are they trying to flop this patch? Ask them to finish the overhaul first. No casual will be able to finish SBQ/ACP within the timer.
---
If Bethesda wants to add new enemies to the ash heap, they should consider the [Gehenna](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gehenna_\(Van_Buren\)) and the [Molechs](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Molech). They'd fit in quite well at the burning mine, since they were originally intended to come from a burning mine.
---
They are certainly the choice no one will complain about.
---
Follow Through, Ammo Factory, and Take One for the Team are the only other ones I'd want.
---
Why did I read that in a William Shatner voice??!???
---
I was also wondering this. Can see them being good for player vendors.
---
When you kill them you can eat the glowing meat. Does this suggest they aren't human at all?
---
Oddly Beckett gives me that legendary gun mission every 2 days.i had the other ones and they never reset that mission.the wanderer kept sending me to save some one over and over.
---
There were 3 of us on a team, and then those dudes.
---
Which could just be her initial reaction. The Overseer is definitely an "unreliable narrator" when it comes to the nature of beasts in Appalachia.
---
Will let you know when it is for sale.
---
Vendor prices are and always have been a stupid reason to harass people. Some people don't trade hundreds of duped gifts or the exact same bloodied explosive laser that's been passed around like a bad heirloom, and aren't aware of what the duper trade subreddits set as the "global" price. This goes double if they're still new, and that is the first gauss rifle they ever found and think it's rare. Or maybe they've realized that caps are useless to high level players and they get tossed around like candy anyway. Going out of your way to harass people for that just says you're petty or have too much time on your hands. If it sells at that price, who are you to tell them what to charge? If it doesn't sell, they will either learn from that or just not sell things, and that's their loss
---
They push it past 15, but you don't get to assign cards beyond 15.
---
However, if you had Luck 11, and then ranked up the Luck Legendary Perk 4 times, you've got 4 whole card slots in Luck to populate with whatever you want.
---
So would I, which makes the conflicting information confusing.
---
This is why I never wear pants. Shitting them would be embarrassing.
---
You do not
---
Follow Through is similar to Tenderse? Is that pick mainly for boss events? I thought that might be good on rifle builds when I saw it.
---
My friend just started the game couple weeks back for the first time and was well over lv200 by the end of the week. It boils down to how dedicated you are and do you take leveling seriously / research best leveling methods. But like i added to my comment, the level needed is well below lv100. So even faster.
---
Yes, everyone who has completed it knows what you get.
---
You get nothing.
---
Explosive weapons shred them. I have a explosive gatling gun and it takes the wendigos in big groups down quickly.
---
Interesting, I did not know that perk stacked, I just joined a few public teams, so I couldn't see if multiple people using strange in numbers affected it, because nobody I joined was sharing it besides myself, also does it stack if everyone is sharing the perk? or is there a limit on it and or diminishing returns that you know of at all?
---
For some, yes. But with only six available at a time, I think for each of my alts it will vary. 
---
I might do it for Intelligence, since all of my characters seem to have a minimum of Int 5 (for Gunsmith or Makeshift Warrior), which is then 5 more points to spend elsewhere. 
---
It will help fine tune some builds to add more ‘off-stat’ perks, but since it can’t make the base stat go above 15, it’s less useful than it could be.
---
In essence it makes sense if: A) You have a stat above 5 and B) There are different stats that aren’t maxed out that you want to use some it’s perk cards.
---
The PA displays were data mined. They’re coming eventually
---
Sofia gives me a similar quest with legendary rewards. I feel bad saying I like Beckett the least because I still enjoyed his story and his VA did a really good job. I just find him boring.
---
That would awesome
---
Agreed!
---
Another well-done writing by u/Gearsthecool 🔥👍👍
---
Yea I want my bos bunker
---
timestamp the handmade for me please.. Im at work and cant watch all that..
---
You get freedom from weeklies and dailies.....
---
That's pretty good, I'm getting 8x5=40 with my quad double barrel. He has a really high armor rating so armor piercing is important - probably not enough to make anti-armor better than bloodied, but you'll definitely want tank killer and a perforating magazine.
---
_shrug_
---
Not a waste of my time if I can farm flux to use/sell. Two birds one nuclear stone.
---
Or like, any other Bethesda game since Morrowind that lets you grab and throw around any item in the game
---
I just want some better stairs, a decorated wooden one or even a spiral one.
---
Ones we got now don't look nice or seem very out of place with the building materials (wood/barn)
---
This is, of course, why the Broadsider is available in all games after 4, to regulate upon those who rant about tenuous canonicity.
---
Nope, my shotgun just to taunt all the side wendigo, not enough to deal serious damage. I don’t even have enforcer perk or any main shotgun perk equipped.
---
Then a 40mm vampire start doing his job.
---
I agree with this analysis. The special perks make far more sense for stats not maxed out yet (and below 11 currently). It will be interesting to see some min maxing going on with people redistributing stats to make optimal use of the special cards.
---
A lot of the non microtansaction  "fancy" camp items can be had by buying plans for them at the Whitesprings.
---
Given the cannibal perk card applies to them, probably not.
---
Ouch that's painful man! There always seems to be one or two left for some reason. Mine was the ghoul one today, which conviniently got stuck at 10.
---
fuck shuttered windows, me and the homies use GLASS WALLS AND ROOF FOR REWARDS!
---
Only 20? Now I know this I can make my perception 70+!
---
Right around 2-6
---
No. Claiming it does not auto-apply it.
---
It's never actually happened to me but I fell asleep playing last night and had a few dailies left, which I stupidly tried to do before the reset
---
No, but that issue has also been patched
---
Are we getting the atom challenges back next week? I finished the score board early ( no I did not buy any) and its kind of boring now. There is nothing to do or earn. I just get on to see people really. Are we going to have something to actually do next week while we wait for the new score board?
---
Reminder we lost a ton of free atoms along with the luxury of choice about what we wanted to spend them on for this garbage.
---
I'll probably either take a break or just leave it happen on it's own through normal play. An entire communist themed season bums me out. 
---
Maybe if they had a gatling laser skin or something like this I'd be interested but handmade and guass pistol skin again. Maybe even a couple liberty prime type items or maybe some holiday related items I would've been interested but nope. Plus yet another set of blue pa paints. 
---
This one shows a severe lack of effort. Just my thoughts on it. 
---
Free states, enclave, and responders still neglected when all three could have fit in here as well.
---
It can't apply it to a placed camp, if it activates it in the atomic shop as your default skin, you would still need to move your CAMP to have the skin take effect. So just claim it and then go to the atomic shop and remove it.
---
Hahaha. 214 here buddy. And im missing 2 uny. Nice to watch his health drain. I usually do one clip per mutation and focus on adds for others.
---
I do want those glass walls...
---
I’ll focus first on the other ones that are useful, since to be honest I’m pretty satisfied with my builds so far. 
---
But I am thinking that it could make some extra flexibility for combat. If I’ve got both melee and ranged perks available, I can switch between my 2H Super Sledge and my Handmade more easily and still be doing high damage, and also have my sneak cards active as well as my critical hit perks.
---
Damn that power armor paint at 100 looks... bad?
---
So that explains why I see player dots then when I go to them it’s actually more like 1500 feet!
---
why are you trying so hard to change or invalidate someones different opinion? lol. i say this as someone who was also disappointed in becketts questline, although for slightly different reasons.
---
Its like their minds were taken apart and slowly being put back together again. The Mole Miner's devolved essentially to their more baser instincts, but as time goes on it seems they are developing a sense of self-preservation as shown by Treasure Hunters and barter, as shown by Mama Murm.
---
1. Yes, people have built amazing camps, but I'm saying why not take it further. And many people like the cluttered aesthetic, I have a medium camp and only half of it managed to become "cluttered" before I ran out of budget. And I have no defense or resourceful items. 
---
2. Yes, it will increase loading time, but so do new events and additions to the game, but since Fallout 76's release I haven't noticed a substantial increase in loading times, so I feel that the increase in time will be negligible (I mean, which do you think increases loading time more: camp budget increase or the Wendigo Colossus event? Ps. The Wendigo Collection event barely increases loading time)
---
3. I'm saying a free increase in camp budget of a substantial amount will be compensated for Bethesda by an increase in sales. I'm not complaining, just pointing out a goldmine of opportunity they are missing. (Why would anyone buy atoms unless it's for their camp, besides the occasional power armor skin?)
---
4. I know there's supposed to be an increase, I'm just giving a reason why the increase should be more than 10-20%
---
Makes me wonder if the code is so baked in that there really is no solution. Not sure how any of it works but one would think a solution would been found by now.
---
I want more micro transaction stuff. I have no problem buying atomic shop stuff. I'd love them to hire some of the modders from 4 to make items.
---
Trust me, I know.
---
Damn you.
---
10 weeks, begins at 30th June until 8th September
---
Maybe it is just a bug, that it isn’t included in the instrument plan?
---
Maybe u/Ladydevann could confirm?
---
Yep. Some of us will even purposely jump in front of your spray of bullets so we'll get tagged and can attack you. (I've been on both sides of this. Lost flux because I too have been a dumbass.)
---
Fuck Beckett. He can take his bar and GTFO of my camp. I helped him out with his brother and took his rewards. Just finished up with Sophia and don't see her going anywhere (although it would be nice to have her stop complaining about having a headache every night).
---
I’m in the exact same situation, I hit 61 on Tuesday. I guess I’m not as far behind others as I thought I was.
---
If they had the DNA to allow ghoulification then why is it Ghouls and Mole Miners would be hostile to each other? Last I checked Ferals dont even beef with non-Feral Ghouls.
---
Also don’t forget everyone who loots it gets one so if you’ve got friends with you can can collect quite quickly
---
Never heard of this. Thank you for potentially saving me alot.
---
Yeah I’m in a similar position with my build - super happy with it already, but can see ways to improve it further (even if only for convenience). Starting to feel like a Demi God in PA though ...
---
The only thing you get is freedom and goddammit you will LIKE it.
---
Not really.
---
There is a FB community for it though.
---
Just wondering if the Weight Bench gives a buff to strength?
---
Nope. I had the garage doors in place on a few of the placement attempts so the garage doors weren't an issue.
---
Dont feel bad.i havent even met Sofia. I been biased as hell w her.i seen those video going on about her headaches...one day I will go through with it.lol
---
Tesla rifles are godly for wiping out the spawns since they always bunch up.
---
Having to move your camp to get the new skin to apply is definitely not an advantage.
---
I would like the drum barrels from meat weak and my survival tent
---
It’s 10 weeks ends on 17th November, so if we recall a week ago u/jg93 said BoS content could ( we don’t know if he means Steel dawn or Fractured steel) coming in November so Season 2 Page have a mistake
---
Edit: sorry for any grammar mistakes
---
If you go to Nexus mods(on PC) there are alternative view models for some items but only you(and people who also have the mod installed) will see them rather than the base item.
---
Hmmm. I guess they could have adjusted it if they felt players were having a hard time finishing season 1.
---
This is different from the "prototype hazmat suit" correct?
---
Thats all good until the whole instance starts doing that and no one but like 1 or 2 people are focusing the colossus
---
The sneak multipliers still show if hes agrod if you are sneaking. The damage dont actually do anything tho
---
No, wanderer has one. I did her quest line a while back and now there’s a bearded looking mennonite vendor in my camp.
---
Same happened yesterday to me. One maybe two other guys. Died alot and when it was done, didn't even get the screws. Big waste of ammo though I switched to sledge about half way through.
---
This 100%  everytime i take one down i spam "follow me" emote until my teammates port to me 😂
---
Military junk and tech scrap?
---
I finished season 1 w/o actually trying hard by power-leveling a new toon and just playing the game and doing events. I plan on doing the same thing again with another toon for season 2.
---
Unfortunately I'm on Xbox. I hope they get modding working soon.
---
I beleive it does. Pretty sure i read it somewhere.
---
Wow. Thanks!  
---
Yes, I am on PC and completely forgot about this mod :)
---
Honestly casuals really shouldn't be able to complete boss events. It's supposed to be hard.
---
Are you sure those are in the correct order? I can’t speak for perk cards but I have a 90%wr Gatling plasma, lever action, and lmg, all of which take the full weight from mods. My lever action, which startd as 0.9, weighs 4.6 after just a stock, scope, and standard long barrel which doesn’t even increase weight.
---
Maybe..
---
I have given exactly zero cloth! I earned it because I am Brotherhood.
---
I was in the same position, ended up going for optimized.
---
Update 22 is shaping up to be a pretty cool update. I'm not exactly looking forward to the grind, but hoping they can tie earning SCORE into daily ops and events rather than just the dailies/weeklies and the xp repeatable.
---
Are you talking about the astronaut? She is a different ally from the wanderer
---
They are missing out on a lot of $. People would love to have more character customization options and are often asking for them. I would also buy into tattoos that don't go on my forehead.
---
I know, right? I mean, ultimately we play video games for entertainment. We have entertainment choices. If Bethesda can’t fit the bill, something else out there might. It just baffles me all the indignant posts of shock and dismay when the season ends and rewards conclude for the season. If constant daily rewards are the only thing keeping a person playing and the gaps between seasons is too long, then I think that says more about the individual than it does the state of the game.
---
Camps are getting interior spaces and PA stands, allowing for larger budgets and more freedom of placement
---
On paper you could be getting 195 with the fixer from stealth, using the Fury chem, covert operative, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, strange in numbers, tank killer, bloody mess. More for headshots from stealth.
---
He sucks as a boyfriend. He just wanted a bar. I miss Gage :(
---
What about Steel Dawn Quest ?
---
Very cool
---
You would need to have every possible xp buff and perk with either the herbivore or carnivore bonus (herb gets more xp bonuses) plus in a build group with strange in numbers.   
---
Then you would also have to have a glitch line in the sand and be the majority killer of them and you would have to do it back to back so lots of lucky server hoping  yo0u could end up with a max of 1400 score per line in the sand. But figure for 1000 on average. You would need to run it 15-20 times a day until it ends. Each event takes 15 minutes total from the time it pops to the time the last mobs die. Figure with server hops you will only get 3 solid uses from lunchboxes each time needing 4 every hourish, once lunchboxes are gone you xp per at max goes to 5k per wave so you will be luck to get 800 score if others are there so now extend that 15-20 to 20-25.   
---
So while not impossible that is one of of a fucking grind that I would be amazed if you did.
---
Damn, I want that glass roof.
---
Lol I'm a shotgun+chem user and I've gotten potentially the best 2-star legendary double barrel ever. It's got the hunter prefix and +50% limb damage....I've got it maxed out for damage+all of the shotgun perks+ridiculous vats so anything (besides SBQ and Earl) goes down in 1-2 shots....I mean everything, nuke zone glowing ones, deathclaws, beheamoths, you name it (scorch beasts not so much). Safe to say I prefer shottys over rifels (although I'll never say no to my 3star blackpowder XD)
---
Edit: that character is level 60 and I got the legendary from the purveyor at level 25 lmao
---
Youre scaring me with your post
---
Are you ps4?
---
Yeah, works for matching PA.
---
I like Survival Shortcut for the chance to ditch worrying about water and food. Frees up 3 slots in agility by dropping Thru Hiker.
---
What Rads will greatly reduce the amount of Radaway I carry. Still will probably need to carry a few for larger, constant rad doses, like nuke zones and Radiation Rumble.
---
Master Infiltrator and Ammo Factory are pure QOL.
---
What did you gain out of saying that? Can politics not infiltrate every community?
---
out of your weapons, the fixer will do the most damage to him, and i suggest tweaking your build, if all you want is damage. you need to go stealth commando, there is a shit ton of guides and videos out there for ya
---
Couldn't agree more with this comment.
---
Does that apply to the "stored blueprints" too?
---
I know you said you don't do mobile camps but was wondering if you came across it anyways. 
---
I couldn't get an actual blueprint of much of anything so I'm relying on the automatic "stored blueprint to move it. All I could do is the flooring. 
---
So I'll put this up on the testing too. I'm going to want wall decor so this is going to be a big issue.
---
It's my favorite weapon, the rock on which my character is built. I just accept that it is made out of paper-mache. Repairing it at least once per big fight is expected.
---
Yes it absolutely does. I’m going to try and see if it can be duplicated later on.
---
I'm a lot more keen on the rewards for the new season though I'm lukewarm on the board's overall theme. Got to get me those sweet glass walls, though.
---
Oh no my internet points :(
---
Keep in mind all of this is being built on a very broken frame
---
I ended up with two of them and can’t do nothing with them. Such a waste. Those two and two winter man masks where the rarest ones I got. Traded a winter man mask for a raven mask a month ago.
---
It's a bug. They shouldn't have them
---
Well damn. Sorry I couldn't help.
---
Theyre the Dwemer.
---
I use my ally as the mannequin 😁👍
---
I still enjoy it 🤷‍♂️
---
Okay so  the mobile version of the site might be a little bugged
---
Man, if I can help at least one person with this post, I’m happy. If I can’t get my 500 atoms back, it’ll be worth it if I can save some other player(s) from this.
---
I hope they do something. I have a standard 3x3 with the basic work stations, a bed, and bobble head stand and am already at about 75% of my build budget.
---
Me too.
---
This. LOL. I am leaving the game this weekend to investigate what that bright light is outside. Furious Sun Ray with 25% faster sun burn rate and 20% less limb damage when enjoyed from a hammock
---
Legendary perks and season 2 starts on the 15th of september.
---
Is there anyway that can backfire? I mean can the ally be killed and your stuff taken etc? (Sorry if that is a dumb noob question. Currently Becker is wearing the Moo suit)
---
It was on the power armor build menu. But then they removed it. They either never had the intention of allowing people to learn the plan or they didn’t want to  spend the time to fix it. It’s disappointing honestly, I have a rare paper weight at this point.
---
In Mother Russia you don’t sit on Legendary Sofa, Legendary Sofa sits on you!
---
So about a month ago or more everytime anyone launched a nuke on Xbox I would fast travel down and as soon as I got there it would do exact same thing. My Xbox never shuts off for being to hot. I have a Xbox one x and it happened like 5 times then nothing again
---
I mean, we've known that for a long time, my dude.
---
That sucks. Doors are kind of important. Lol
---
To tell the truth I think I have only 2 doors I need to place. Outside of the garage doors but I've already moved it with those and it worked.
---
Nope. No issues whatsoever to this day anyway.
---
Same thing with my poor goo piles
---
Gramps was giving me that quest every day... Then he broke. Now I get it once in a while from the Wanderer.
---
They may also just make it part of the BOS invasion, or hand it out on the shop as free content. It has not been determined.
---
YES
---
I have it as my helmet on my Pale Rider PA.
---
It's a good thing power armors come with a bathroom installed in them.
---
At least I hope they do...
---
amazing
---
Id love some new hair styles. Not just some from previous fallouts but new new
---
Something i dont like about the atomic shop is that there isnt the classic: "Are you sure you want to buy *insert item name*?" "Yes/No" That annoy me, i havent missclicked yet, but i feel someone may did. In PC at least on Steam, i recomend you dont write to your steam friends or minimize to do something else while being in the atomic shop, it may buy you stuff because of the "Spacebar".
---
Makes complete sense and would add a lot of depth to the crafting aspect of the game.  
---
So don't count on it.
---
My entirely limited knowledge says the placement of a blueprint is going to be the same regardless of being saved by the game or printed by you.
---
Every nuka grape ever
---
my TSE handmade does about 4 with all rifleman maxed, bloody mess maxed, and demo expert maxed
---
It's not a problem to be the hero of your own story,  just don't let the story be an incel fairy tale.
---
No worries. I appreciate it none the less.
---
There is 6 legendary card slots, not 4. Requiring total of 1800 perk coins. Not many people out there that will reach high enough levels to max them all.
---
Less then 200 to just get the legendary perk, but last I checked it's hard to level up with no perks at all.
---
There is no hacked handmade in that video but [here I searched one just for you](https://youtu.be/zpUfJEEsvpU?t=3192)
---
There are 4 on the pts.
---
To be clear: They specified that utility items are getting the bullion addition. Unless they make the greenhouse have some sort of in-game effect, it is probably not going to be available for bullion.
---
Honestly, kinda shocked they don't just cram it all as bullion purchasable afterwards, drop a special vendor for that season somewhere.
---
but there so meany
---
That would be the "Health Kit", it seems. Still there.
---
I’ve hit just over 200+ on his head while crouched using a BE Flamer with all the Heavy Gunner perks, Stabilized, Nerd Rage, Demolition Expert, and Covert Operative equipped. I’m also on Psychotats. First time I did it I got him to regen before anyone else had started firing on him before my gun broke. Gonna see what I can get that number up too with A big guns Bobblehead and Curse of the Wendigo in effect sometime.
---
If we did I wouldn't have asked
---
Nope, PC
---
Assultron named kilroy
---
It is supposed to give a buff after use, last I heard.
---
Ok thank you
---
You do know that you can scrap your ally and replace them over and over until they give you the collect a weapon mission. So everyday is a legendary weapon day.
---
They need to buff weapon durability when doing “world bosses” anyway. Like what they said they will do with daily ops.
---
Whats max Bullion ? count ?
---
Same as season 1 for me
---
Pretty sure you get one or three months of free live with a new account
---
Ok. I'm going to try it out later tonight. Obviously a "ship" or any camp really, without things hanging on the wall is... Well not a camp.
---
4k
---
Don't you think it's a logical step to add the Greenhouse Tiles to the Settlers for bullion to accompany the Dirt tiles? Seems like a bit of a no-brainer.
---
You must be lower level then. You get a slot at lv50, 75, 100, 150, 200 and 300.
---
Not really, I feel like you can only plant certain crops in camps so that the others are more rare and have to be sought out. But instruments aren't used for anything besides being well tuned which you get from all instruments anyway so it makes no sense to make some of them buildable and others not.
---
Although I do wish you could place tarberries in you camp if you have water because they are a bitch to aquire.
---
I am, but I likely won't get into it every day like TLR now that I'm going back to work in a school.
---
That being said, my region's numbers are up and school starts Tuesday... And I fully expect to be in and out of work for a couple of weeks at a time.
---
TL;DR: I'll play, but not every day, unless I get temporarily laid off again, then yeah, I'll play heavily.
---
Less than 100. Lets say you are a level 100. Thats 200 coins there, plus all the perks card packs you get every 5 levels on top of that. Well over 300 coins.
---
I get around 200 but if I’m doing body non vat shots I do around 90. I have a bloodied fixer that the sweet ass purveyor gave me but it’s 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage. I switched my whole build just for that gun. I have maxed out agility 15 points. I’m not getting as much because I started using 3 points intelligence for batteries included instead of nerd rage. If I wasn’t such a hoarder I would switch my build more. I have all 5 unyielding 3 star secret service armor but sometimes I switch one leg out for chameleon marine armor with weapon weight reduction
---
Nope.  I see the locked ones.  There are only 4.  Are you on pts?  My guess is they only show one locked one until you unlock it and then they show the next, but that's really weird.
---
This is my build...maybe I'm not close enough.
---
Are you game sharing? Gold is shared across a console that way
---
No problem :)
---
Depends on your build. What type of weapons do you usually use, like guns or melee weapons? Are you bloodied, junkie's, etc? Answers to those questions will determine what's "best" for you to use/trade/grind for.
---
If your xbox is set as the home console of an account with an active xbox live subscription, then all accounts on your xbox will have that same subscription.
---
If your main account has gold and has your Xbox set as home all accounts on it can play online with gold.
---
Try leveling up without any perks.  Yes less then 100 for the legendary perk itself, but to level up you need regular perks too.
---
Well i have my own main account with ultimate on the same console and my gfs account is also on this console with ultimate
---
People are really after faster fire rate and faster swing speed weapons.
---
Rifle Gaming nukes camps when they have over priced items.
---
I agree I don't mind grind in my games or end game but this game is way too RNG. Maybe they could tone it down a little with this.
---
If you mean a new XBox account, then as long as the ‘primary’ account assigned to that device has Gold, then any other accounts that are on that specific console have access to gold, on that specific console. 
---
Example:  On my wife’s XBox, my account with Gold is assigned and designates that console as it’s ‘home’.  That means either of us, on that console, have access to the Gold benefits. 
---
On my XBox, I am also signed in on my account. Because my account has Gold, I have Gold access on any XBox.
---
So we are both able to play with just one Gold account.
---
oof
---
You can have max reputation with both factions. 
---
You can only do the vault raid with ONE faction. 
---
You can choose to split the reward with both of them, one of them, or keep the reward to yourself. (No spoilers just in case)
---
You can unlock/purchase all the rewards for both factions once you reached max reputation. 
---
They will not turn hostile towards you, regardless of your decisions.
---
Dont have space for adrenaline, but I'll take another look. What dmg do u get with that perk?
---
Have you set either as the home console?
---
If the cannon isn't canon, then I say to the cannon with canon!
---
Nope. This is what we get now. Weeks filled with nothingness and no insperation to play the game anymore.
---
You level up, using the perks you need to do so, and then scrap everything. If one is talking about dedicated ammo character. He does not need other perks than ammo smith, super duper and the legendary perk.
---
Oh man, I like what I see! And the stuff towards the end looks even cooler this time.
---
The sell:buy ratio is like 1:4 for everything so I don't think there's an ammo you can craft where you'll come out ahead. You can use it to get around being out of plastic or gunpowder though, since you can craft things like 2mm EC or .50 caliber ball ammo without them, then trade it in for shotgun shells or energy weapon ammo.
---
How do i see what account is set as home?
---
That or something that uses something along the line of lawmen sounds cool. 
---
Are you wanting to go for a wandering sheriff or more militaristic swap setup? It would definitely change what build you’re going for. Sounds like you like the idea of the traditional Wild West lawman
---
Oh so it's G.I. Joe themed?
---
But then you can't use the character again.
---
Was hoping for more Bullion, measley amounts and the grind for that is all I'm playing for at the moment (and can't be bothered playing events for treasury notes unless Collosal appears).  Trying to finish my T-65 but other than that loosing interest.  Once I finished Season 1 on Sunday I've barely touched the game all week (and I've been home on holiday all week).
---
Will probably play more once this launches but not really out of desire for the rewards, more out of weird grind feedback that this game continues to give me!
---
Meh, more junk just like season.1. I'll try out the camp items in someone else's camp. Back to working on my backlog of games until some actual substance is added to this game.
---
We don't see any cranberries growing like they usually do in a bog, tarberries seem to have taken their place as bog plants. The cranberry plants seem to have mutated to be more bushy and the fruits they produce are much larger than normal cranberries. And for some reason (besides at Aaronholt homestead) they require sundew trees to be disease free.
---
It was full body cringe.  Very teenage voice declaring "once everyone gets their hits in,  I'll f_ck her up..." *pause as he has the idea to add the next sentence*  "...f_ck her right in the p_ssy."
---
Dude.  Like. DUDE.  Stahp. Not only maximum cringe, but just hilariously bad mental imagery of guy in power armor struggling to copulate with giant mutant bat.  Ugh.
---
Yes, it's a bug
---
There has been no indication from Bethesda what we will see between 12 noon ET Sep 8th and 12 noon ET Sep 15th.
---
I truly loved the commie one until I got the raider one. I never really used the other collectrons. But I started using the commie one and had him bring me blood packs and Chinese swords and grenades. The blood packs where game changer. Never had to go for tick blood anymore. Had so many stims just from that, but after getting so many I bought Raider one and just the ammo and guns for scrap is awesome
---
Besides, I wouldn't want to risk losing so much ammo or so many resources transferring between characters.
---
Log into main account. It’s in the settings somewhere. But if you have only ever logged into that one Xbox it probably is set as home console. It’s what allows all accounts on the Xbox to play the games your main account owns.
---
Always be sure to check where the greatest concentration of players are.  If you follow the pack you have a much greater chance of downing both bosses when both spawn at once.
---
If scorched earth is empty get to ACP asap.
---
If i over price something id rather you send a message to me telling me that i have. Idk what people sell things at. I usually sell junk and ammo. I bulk the junk i want to sell and half its price. If its to high message don’t destroy my camp because i wasted so much time on it
---
Fair point. 
---
I'VE known about it for a long time.
---
Level up to the level you need to max the card out, bank all your perk packs and level ups not needed for levelling , then scrap all your cards. Problem solved.
---
No wonder I've seen an uptick in people clearing out all the ballistic bock at my bar.
---
I run with a JE FR gat plasma and cumulative on headshots without dipping into nerd rage 240-250 mark with lone wanderer tenderizer bloody mess and master heavy gunner perks without buffs. I think it’s up to 36% with maxed out
---
I thought it was 5k but whatever
---
The Gehenna seems to be a slight inspiration for Beth’s version of the Grafton Monster
---
Well just this afternoon i logged in on my gfs xbox to resolve something, other than that i always logged in on my own xbox for last 5 years
---
Then you can't use the character afterwards.
---
The wooden log door looks so dumb.  I was thinking it might actually look like a log with knots and little holes in it.
---
That's a frickin heavy paper weight.
---
Ive heard 4k in the enclave discord im in, I haven't bothered to test it out
---
Are you on PC?
---
Based on what we know about BoS so far, probably cloth, concrete, cork...wood.
---
When season 1 score rewards were data mined, they found the full skeleton anatomy model in the files . There are 3 camp items unless they are designed to be a hat stand

Ah I was wondering how one swapped them out. With the bug I hadn't bothered figuring it out though. That sucks.
---
You have to nuke it every time you want the event to happen, like sbq.  It doesn't make any sense.
---
Have to nuke it everytime
---
I try to stay under 3k anyways
---
Naturally requires a friend to help with transfering the ammo or extra account which you can get for 10e on PC.
---
That’s fine. You have to actively set an Xbox to home. If your second account can play all your main accounts games then your Xbox is set as home. You get gold and game pass and purchases shared from main account.
---
That's what I do. I need the ammo and screws, and when I don't, a shocking number of players ignore the wendigos and die to them, more so than earl himself. Last time, I got 150 screws while also DPSing earl. That was just me casually hitting spawns attacking others and looting them before going back to earl.
---
That's a good point about Vault 76. I will have to take that into account...
---
No, and have no idea why people keep asking.
---
So nothing next week at all since the season is over? Is that meat week? Seems odd to have a gap.
---
I also finished the board last week and this week feels empty already.
---
The mine is an instance and you can only enter it when the event procs, which happens when you (or anyone) nukes it. If you missed it there's a holotape you can collect and give to Maggie, but it spawns whenever you enter the instance so you can go get if you haven't already. There's also some notes down there written by Earle from before he became a Wendigo.
---
Now I'm imagining [this](https://imgur.com/a/B7D1Ggn) but w Muties &amp; nothing would make me happier.
---
That would be so tedious.  I'd rather just go get some acid and cloth and make gunpowder or go farm cloth, but this is true.
---
It would be time consuming, and unless they remove the *ability* to create these sorts of weapons and armor, said hacked tings will keep coming back.
---
Why they refuse to give us the modern abstract paintings i don't know. It drives me crazy and honestly at this point one has to chalk it up to their usual incompetence.
---
Thats why i said dedicated ammo guy :) Only purpose for him/her.
---
Im lvl 124 and I've got my heavy weapons perks maxed, shotgun perks, auto and semi auto rifles done. I just need better weapons that the ones I've got cause last time I played two shot explosive was the only good weapons now i don't know what I should be trying to get.
---
I can see all the installed games on my xbox from my main account, not gamepass ones tho
---
No, because the greenhouse tiles are not utility items, they're pure cosmetics.
---
Personally? Yeah, I think they should be. But that's not what they said they would do.
---
10 euro?  Now I have to pay irl money for ammo?  No thanks.
---
To add if you have friends or a mule on a second console/system you can down the bot and everyone can come to you and each get a card.
---
Ill down a bot and put my tent near by and tell all those I'm playing with to come to me so when I'm playing with 8 people its 8 cards.
---
Sometimes my partner will also tag along and give me her cards so I get 2 cards per bot because she only plays casually.
---
I think leg perks were on the test only. Some problems found and bumped it to next update.
---
I've got one weighing down my stash,  but it's not quite as pressing a concern as the 20+ wendigo colossus vocal sacks I got.
---
Should just scrap them but what if a really good plan is eventually made for them.   .o   ,
---
I didn’t know season 1 existed until a couple days ago, so I currently intend to play season 2
---
Nope, I do not. I have a two-shot gatling laser, and I have an explosive .50 cal, but no weapon with both perks on it.
---
Do you run Luck of the Draw? Curious if it would trigger more often as more "hits" are being registered.
---
Ah fair enough starting to understand now!
---
I choose my ally based on what fits best with my camp theme.
---
Pretty good
---
I didnt think the explosive effect worked on the bosses unless its splash dmg.
---
You have definitely given me a whole new perspective on mole men.
---
Couldn't you just equip/unequip the ammo card every time you want to make ammo?
---
Oh cool. Another red handmade skin. Some of the camp stuff looks cool tbh but this season's theme is ass.
---
Ok. But if you are playing FO76 and you didn’t have to repurchase it then you are getting it from your main account.
---
You'll have wandering vendors come through your camp regardless of the ally. They are not linked other than the assaultron.
---
Logic to me says having 30 more special that you can use for perk cards outweigh all the others and since you can hotswap for 2 coins total when it is time to mass produce ammo is what I will do so 2 levels max needed to 2-3 server hops on 30 minutes of my time.   
---
I mean that makes you a level 80 character I am using this as my jump off point [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=a3a4aa9](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=a3a4aa9) and the extra perk card will be charisma so I can share 3 star cards. Perception is meh to me since I rarely use rifles ever. But overall the possibility to have 5 rank 15 Specials is HUGE!!! (well 4 and 14 in luck for me since I want the 3 star in C) I mean the QoL perks alone win over any of the other legendary perks to me aside from ammo.
---
Just because everyone else is cheating doesn't mean you should too.
---
It's 5k is max. I hit 4700 last night and was like let's go buy random stuff since I already have all the stuff I need/want
---
Awesome thnx i thought maybe this only lasts like the first comment said like 3 months and then need to repurchase gold on this new account
---
Thank you for sharing this tip👍 Updooted 😁
---
Yea i'm on PTS and looking at 6 legendary perks slots right now.
---
I’m so tired of only getting a weapon find about 1 out of 10 missions anymore. When that happens I switch them. I’m in Beckett now and he sucks. I only got two weapon missions and they where crap. Not even 3 stars. The Astro at least got me a couple 3 star including my 3 star bloodied cyro. Wish allies where more awesome
---
i think the canon ending for the master is he dies
---
Wish we could have had athena as a companion.
---
We wont fail we almost did on concrete they lowered the amount and then we "just" made it...
---
Yes I'm suggesting they are not honest with the numbers.
---
You kill The Master in Fallout 1. Which is 2126 and Fallout 76 is in 2106. The first super mutant was created in 2103. It took the Master 30 years to create a small group of super mutants. By 2137 you get your mass produced super mutants. Until then you just have a small group of them created and ran by The Master.
---
Exploiters will exploit but there is a legit little ammo maker after grinding raider rep. But only one may be placed
---
I have tried Luck of the Draw in ACP a couple of times - not sure that it *really* helps prevent my weapon from melting. It procs several times.
---
People make gunpowder?
---
That's true but some people just have alt characters for this sort of thing that aren't meant to be played. Just depends on how each person uses there characters.
---
Nope! I have my moms Xbox set as my home so she can access my games and gold for free. She doesn’t play much so it doesn’t make sense for her to pay for those things.  :)
---
Yeah, so my thought is that it hides the extra ones until you unlock them.  Wierd.
---
Yes!!! I have a group of low level friends who just got the game recently but we don’t play with each other much due to the power difference! Been wanting “One Wasteland” for a while!
---
I do.  It's easy.
---
unless you plan on melee, there really isn't much for the arms, the only options for the arms is:
---
(hydraulic bracers) which increases unarmed damage
---
(optimized bracers) which reduce action point cost for power attacks
---
(rusty knuckles) which causes bleeding damage
---
(tesla braces) which add energy damage to unarmed attacks
---
to be honest I'm just leaving my arms mod free, unless Bethesda comes out with something else for ranged weapons the arms would just be throwing the bullion away. If I had to choose any it would probably be the knuckles for the bleed damage.
---
Not sure how helpful this was but hope it does help a bit. Have fun
---
I recommend just buying when ur within 5 ranks of the items you want most.
---
To be honest, I doubt \*game\* sales is a drawing point by now (atom sales and 1st subs are different). If you have not bought by now, you probably won't. But releasing major content during the holidays may keep folks from completly forgetting the game, which seems more likely to me.
---
Absolutely. It would cost 1 perk coin each time you change it but that is cheap. But the main reason i don't want to is because the legendary perk coins get harder and harder to get as you level up (leveling takes longer). So we have to work with very limited amount of coins. So spending them on something that you only use when crafting is not very optimal to me. Better to buy perks that benefit you 100% of the time. And use that dedicated ammo guy. But this is just my humble opinion.
---
Anybody a bit concerned with the adding of more weeklies and getting things like 2500 caps very early on, that Level 2 is gonna require 25 more SCORE than it did for Level 100 of Season 1 and it will continue to build up every level?
---
Use a friend then :)
---
Anyone know Will legendary modules be on sale?
---
My personal fave ... man, I love their website. So many layers of entertainment.
---
Its 5k. Im at 4850 bullion.
---
What about that camp fire trick people used to use for planting plants indoors?
---
Seriously 25 gold bullion .. and lunch boxes, and scrap kits when you can just pick up junk and scrap weapons
---
You can get "4" treasury notes in most quests and better rewards in events
---
The ghillie marine arms usually get half in way of your screen while aiming a heavy gun
---
The super mutants in Appalachia is explained in the lore around Huntersville and West Tek
---
Not sure myself but I run the splitter instead of focused. Each hit comes in 52-62
---
In regards to 2., good items get distributed on the main network, it's because someone leaked it when they weren't supposed to. 
---
And in regards to 3., this is hilarious because I've never had to do a damn thing except be nice and social with people, and I get handed hundreds of pounds of stuff. I can't imagine what it's like for those who have to put in effort to get handed stuff. Lmao. My bloodied explosive fixers? Handed to me. All the backpack mod plans? Handed to me. All of the rare outfits in the game? Fucking *handed* to me.
---
Sorry some of y'all have to kiss ass for mere scraps.
---
I have mixed results. Sometimes I Get around 500 others around 190. Don’t know why
---
Far oveeer, the Misty Mountains caaaall
---
I didn't know that I thought once they gave you that mission it stays with that person till complete..nice to know
---
Same, been bored af after completion but these peeps who are stating there won't be anything know just as much as us...nothing..time will tell.
---
100% the rewards are way better in season 2 then season 1
---
Closed my friends
---
The Master dies in Fallout 1 the super mutants in 76 are a result if government experimentation in the town of Huntersville I believe with help from West-Tek. They released the FEV into the water supply of the town turning the townsfolk into super mutants
---
It's Railway Spikes
---
Steel -&gt; Spikes -&gt; Points -&gt; Profit
---
I was wondering about this too. If the railroad spikes are the cheapest/easiest to make as far as materials go (not even sure if that's accurate, just throwing it out there as a possibility as I've never crafted them), then would it be worth crafting a fuckton of them, converting to points, then buying whatever ammo you want?
---
It's a bugged T-45 skin right now.
---
This was helpful. I really have no need for any of these but because I need to spend bullion I have to make a choice and I already have everything else I need.
---
+karma
---
That tunnel at the Rusty Pick is a dead end now.  Maybe it will be opened later?
---
And be limited by time zones, availability, etc?  I think I'll just "lose" one perk slot for the convenience.
---
I’ve only found it out a few weeks ago. I use the punk raider and just let him give me the mission and then quickly scrap him until it’s the right one . He seems to give me the weapon mission the most.
---
What weapon r u using?
---
Ah yeah whatever happened to those?
---
The cosmetics are better than last season.
---
Every Gamebryo title ever.
---
Until they get delayed for introducing a new bug that doesnt let you pick any perks when you use a level up but still spends the point.
---
Brother of steel bunker and greenhouse locked behind a paywall which is your time and energy in any atoms you buy or spend
---
Some problems found 🤣🤣🤣🤣 way to sugarcoat it.
---
B2525 fixer with psychotats, overdrive and ballistic bock. I’ve been trying to figure out why sometimes I do way more damage compared to others
---
Besides the ace of spades symbol on it I really like the tier 100 power armor looks pretty cool. Reminds me almost of the flair on federation ships from star trek.
---
I have 3 open on a level 7 character.  So your highest level character unlocks slots for all characters?
---
I was there when the mine got nuked but the entrance was still closed. I didn’t see any event get started and there was no pop up notification like there is with other events. Is there a way to manually start the event.
---
The thing about corporations is they used to have child miners before laws where passed. I assume those laws weren't passed in the FOU.
---
4lbs each tho!!! I've been scrapping. 😬😬 It was novel for about 1 day having a Thanksgiving display full of balls but then I was like damn I need the space back 😂
---
Keep raising your wanted rating and see how long you can go ducking bounty hunters.
---
That is an option. Buuuuut :D You could craft large enough quantities that you don't have to depend on those time zones etc that much :D I main a stealth commando and i craft ammo maybe once a month, and i play daily for maybe 2-3h.
---
The Master I believe hasn’t yet been smoked or just become emerged in the FEV, but this game has made no references to him as WV has no contact with the West Coast since the BoS loss connection with Taggerdy. 
---
The reason we still see super mutants is Bethesda has done a soft retcon by basically establishing that West Tek has been experimenting with FEV all across the country. The reason we didn’t know about this sooner is basically explained by the lack of communication in the wasteland. Most Bethesda titles will most likely continue to reveal more West Tek locations that were experimenting with FEV
---
Truly,  but what if???
---
Handmade rifle skin is cool but it needs the silencer fixed on it
---
Oh FUCK yes. Id also kill for plushies of the cryptids. Sheepsquatch got two but where’s our Mothman plushies!
---
Maybe we can get Beaver Tails as a nod to our pastry loving pals to the North.
---
I think this is what I was wondering - sounds like it's not good as a general approach to keeping primary ammo stocks high, but alright in a fix when you're caught short.
---
Edit: clarity
---
Oh they like to tease stuff but have not followed through. Like the horse river pictographs. There is a mystery around this and can be stitched together on terminals in the game. Been obsessed iver it sense beta. But nothing has been added to help solve the mystery. Also the church in the mire. Why is there music at night? It is madaning.
---
I do heavy gunner so I doubt we have the same ammo consumption.  I don't think losing one slot is a big deal.  I already play for efficiency over max dps anyway.
---
Well. Since everyone else is so stingy ill fill you in. You need to go turn on the ammo maker at the ammo dump workshop. Then you can blueprint it. Then you can put it in your camp and poof your making ammo. I think i read that you need to set it to whatever ammo you want while at the workshop but idk if thats true.
---
Wow! Looks like it! That was news to me. Thats very very handy for alts that can use those rank 1 legendary perks. I have 6 slots on my lv16.
---
Based on the time line, he's most likely  in the mid stages of FEV experimentation. Richard Grey officially named himself the Master in July 2102, and Vault 76 opened up in October 2102.
---
the era of free atoms is over and dunzo..
---
he sounds like a mole miner, wears a mask, talks about being in the dark.  he for sure is.
---
🥺 then I'll be asking you for some spare sacs
---
Usually means no one repaired the screeching box thing after the scorched managed to break it.
---
XD
---
Glass mazes anyone?
---
It won't be usable; like the little chinese igloo, everything will float above the ground in it, since it's just a reskin of that.
---
And there was a perk to double said wood... If only.
---
Yeah, that'll be great for leveling new characters.
---
Gives you a buff to Stength
---
Oh, I know, but hush, we're busy over here subsiding entirely on FAITH. FAITH, i tell you, HOPE! Surely they'll give us a story, hope hope hope!
---
It's something we're working on but it won't be in the next patch.
---
Depends on weapons you use. I used to main heavy gunner that used a gatling gun for daily running around and minigun for bosses only (same cheap 5mm ammo). I don't think i crafted any more frequently.
---
But absolutely if you only use some fast firing heavy gun you will burn ammo faster.
---
I do not run Bloodied and get 5 per headshot with my Minigun
---
Great for you. I keep getting junkies bone hammers with reduced weight and 33% vats chance. Or a medics pipe rifle with 40% more bash damage and +1charisma.
---
A gap week is nice so you don't totallty burn-out your playerbase.
---
yes
---
Thanks 😎👍🏼
---
That was supposedly patched for those not to cause so much damage and lag out servers anymore, but goddamn, the FPS really suffers.
---
My best memory from the game was running across the legendary item shop(?) with this old miner lady in it, towards the start of the game. So many cool details in the store and I was absolutely upset when I realized there's nothing to do in there.
---
Lore wise nuclear blasts were used to create ultracite deep within the mines of Cranberry bog. It could be possible that the heat and radiation shot through the tunnels and somehow broke through to tunnels in the Savage Divide and Ash Heap since it would have been an enclosed blast.
---
Yes it's PC. Hence the existence of hacked weapons.
---
neat.  time to horde script....
---
Only make it. It is too heavy, and it's components can sit in the scrap box till you need, Fo1st necessary.
---
Yes, play since launch
---
Did you do enough damage to get rewards?
---
Oh I hate it, I died and had a long timer, well due the timer earl died and then the game put me outside the mine, so I couldn't loot earl. Kind of pissed about that.
---
Yes.  Especially when stacking XP buffs, Double XP weekends, and now the new lunchboxes. 
---
A bloodied build alone is getting massive XP bonuses from every point of INT they have.
---
I’m constantly spouting guns, bullets and aid. One would think I’m some sort of free collectron for low levels XD
---
Which is a shame given that we were originally told we’d be able to buy items from the atom shop by grinding in game, and the seasons now limit us on that.  So chalk that up to another “improvment” they have made.
---
Theres a  natural drop location for it???
---
Been hoarding them and buying up all the rounds I come across hoping one day to get a decent roll for that gun.
---
Yes it is doable, but very unlikely. There are people at those levels that have played only legit, but most of them have exploited xp glitches. There have been several well known ones in the game since launch.
---
I couldn't bring myself to kill the treasure hunting mole miners after my first encounter with one. It fled from me in terror and was obviously a sentient being. It wasn't hostile even though its friends were. 
---
I'd agree, there's a lot to explore with Mole Miners if Beth is so inclined. I also think Super Mutants have been underutilized. They obviously hate the Scorched as much as the 76ers do, they fight whenever they are in close proximity to each other. Could have made for an interesting alliance between the humans and some smarter mutants.
---
Yeah, wouls destroy the economy. A once in a lifetime weapon becomes grindable in an afternoon
---
People tend to not realize the main reason cranberries are planted in a bog is to aid with harvesting. Flood the entire field, they all pop right off and float to the surface.
---
I agree. My new favorite weapon on my bloodied character.
---
I get there are new, low-level players, but get rid of the Caps and Perk Card rewards on these new Seasons...add more Atoms...give people the chance to buy at least some stuff from the Shop.
---
I have 1st now, so have a way of getting Atoms, but not everyone can afford it. At least give people who commit to the game a chance to pick up more Atoms so they can have more than just the basic stuff to build with.
---
Oh man, if I grind my ass off for it only for it to be purchasable after it’s over I will be pissed. That whole system defeats the entire purpose of a battle pass.
---
There is a small slither on my raider rep.think I'm at neighborly. Plz let me know it's the last one before unlocking everything!
---
There was supposed to be. No surprise once again Bethesda lied to us about something. Only thing they seem to be good at any more.
---
I guess. It's pretty hollow.
---
Hershey squirts
---
It doesn't matter. You can get full allegiance with both sides via quests. 
---
The game will tell you when the "point of no return" is.
---
I just seem to always have too much and end up dropping hundres where i go.
---
Lol I don’t care if they have to fudge the numbers, I just want this discount.
---
Ive been fallowing the PTS forum closely. Im teally looking forward to the changes. Totaly agree with future balancing made easier aswell.  Something had to change and its gotta start somewhere.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 End Game. Seasons and world challenges are the only way to get free atoms, and that has been well publicized since Beth first announced seasons. Periodic events like Meat Week exist to break up the routine. Until Daily Ops and story expansions drop, this is the state of things right now.
---
Yes. I'll never use any of them, just like I won't use the ugly ass skins from last season besides the Cosmos ones.
---
I used to then I started crafting 10's of thousands of 50 cal bullets.
---
Enclave skulls
---
Can you throw me a bone here... Can I share the Vault 79 VTU plans with both Paige and Meg? Is the point of no return when you actually decide to raid the vault?
---
Fracturing an already small population of players is not a smart idea for the longevity of an online only game.
---
Do you really think they would give us the atoms back after they just trained us to play for Score? Think a little bud.
---
I sell mine for 1, 5, and 10, tho partially its due to my camp being a rather elaborate Silent Hill experience.
---
So I keep my prices dirt cheap to compensate the time players dedicated to making it to the vendors.
---
Average of about 3 out of 5 never make it to the end.
---
Some out of fear of it being a trap, some for just being too impatient. 
---
Also sell my legendaries for 100 a star, even if their magic, and plans for 50 and recipes for 5. Even if their highly sought after.
---
Peeps who make it to the end usually are quite elated and love the place.
---
Made alot of new friends that way. ^  o^
---
Probably not, it seems that all the worth while rewards are later into it and with the possibility of auto completing challenges messing me up for a while day/week it’s just another thing to try and get me to play when they can’t get actual content out fast because of a small dev team
---
The chicken coop is towards the end of the board and that'll be up for gold bullion once the season ends.
---
And no, not particularly. A battlepass is there for you to grind and earn rewards. It is your decision on whether to grind for them or not. It's only one reward out of 99.
---
So easy to get wood in this game OP. An hour running round The Forest and you've enough wood to build a small mansion.
---
I would be about that level if I didn’t keep changing characters and making new builds. I’ve been playing since beta and all my characters are at about level 200 that’s usually where I stop and make a new instead of moving all my cards around and perk points
---
Spoken like a true gentleman I do say.
---
No you cannot pick both sides to do the raid. You can only pick one side.
---
Neither side will give a shit if you pick the other. Nothing will change at all whatsoever.
---
Sounds like alot of effort. Ill stick with my gatling gun.
---
ahm can it be.... that the "red viper" skin for the handmade rifle is THE SAME pattern as the "blood eagle" skin from season one!?
---
It's easy, like super easy. If you self buff.
---
Think a little yourself chief, seasons was meant to keep people playing. It's you conspiracy nuts who think it was purely to work harder for atoms.
---
The ammo converter is unique.
---
The sink is functional, but only provides dirty water. The chicken coup is functional and provides 10 fertiliser which is more fertiliser than the brahmin pen
---
Everything else is cosmetic
---
Fingers crossed , it’s utility so maybe.
---
Mole Miners always reminded me of the Ghost People in Fallout New Vegas. Mostly because of the loading screen that was mentioned. Like both Mole Miners and the Ghost Prople are trapped in their suits. While Ghost People were created by the cloud, Mole Miners could very well have encounter something similar in the mines scattered around Appalachia. IDK it made sense to me, but who knows.
---
Too many good ones to pick a favorite but ive been rockn the blue ridge outfit, worn patriotic tophat, and my patrolman glasses
---
I asked 2 different questions there... \^\^
---
1. Daily missions give the most.
---
2. It won't lock you out of earning the items from the factions, minus the quest specific rewards.
---
3. The point of no return is you lose the experience from the side you didn't go with.
---
I was expecting more mystery places like Dunwich. Appalachia has SO MANY real life supernatural places. Seems like a missed opprotunity. The time frame the game takes place. Jesus the missed opprotunity. All you got was notes and holotapes about the time just after the war in the other games. This was a chance to SEE it. Even with wastelanders you just get a peek 2 comments at foundation. "Glad to be out of the pit". I do hope with expeditions we get some of this.
---
I don't craft very often though.
---
This is going to be interesting. Concerns on the PTS have been all but ignored, but it seems like some of them have already bled over.
---
That is wonderful advice, thank you so much!
---
I love the Mole Miners, they're one of my favorite enemies in this game and the only one that still spooks me, even almost 200 levels later. The way they talk and look is just so frightening to me.
---
I like my surgical mask+med goggles+bos science scribe outfit
---
Still searching and hoping. 😋
---
*Places weight bench in BoS field station* Beefcake Brotherhood ™
---
That's so awesome :D I'm glad that they took their time with the legendary perks.
---
Oof. No balance pass, huh? Just One Wasteland as it is on the PTS. It's going to be interesting seeing how the community responds.
---
I'm really torn on this one. I don't want people to suffer frame rate issues, so it needs to be fixed, definitely... but the ash piles have been bugged for so long, and I dunno about you folks, but being able to permanently prevent an enemy from respawning on a server is super useful.
---
There are 2 Scorched that have a legit spawn near my CAMP, so I log in, goo/ash them, and I don't have to worry about them attacking my camp for the rest of my session. I do still have to worry about the "random" spawns that show up at your camp, but at least the fixed ones I can avoid.
---
And I'd feel bad about using this "exploit" but I think it's bullshit a LVL 1 Scorched can do damage from 200 yards to my Fusion Generator. I have to listen for the soft "plink" noises to even know I'm under attack. So, ash `em.
---
Sometimes they do respawn, but naked and without a head and they're unable to take damage or move. This is always good for a chuckle.
---
Dude, I cannot express clearly enough how little it matters which side you pick. You can only do the raid ONCE, and you can only pick ONE side to do it with. So yeah, the raid itself is the "point of no return", AND THE GAME WILL TELL YOU THAT.
---
The funny thing is everyone here talk like they will max many cards,but with the avarage player level,it will barely be 2 cards.
---
Visit the Overseer and talk to Davenport for Photo Opportunities,  basically spying on the Raiders and then give your pictures free to the Foundation. Also do free daily missions for Ward at the Foundation. This will slowly but steadily raise you reputation. Worth it, I got the gauss shotgun and can do 600 damage per shot now with my shotgunner build.
---
This is after the raid if you go with the Raiders. And keep all the gold!!
---
I glitched myself to the room with the friendly MM under the rusty pick and the tunnel leads nowhere it just ends sorry mate
---
It's not possible to miss the goal, it'll be okay.
---
Im more worried about magic heavy gunners murdering queeny in 30 seconds to save on time
---
I'd like to see Emotes available in Photomode too. Some of those poses and anims can be used creatively to get some good shots, like the thirsty drinking one, or shrugging, or even just crossing your arms.
---
This is both surprising and extremely welcomed. They obviously are listening with these perks.
---
Just hope they will continue to listen on other big issues as well. XD
---
Either you haven't completed the enclave questline, didn't do enough damage, or were not actually in the event. Has happened a couple times lately where I FT to someone or something down there and still have to go to the map and click join event.
---
I'm afraid I don't know what trick you have in mind, but I doubt it will work, just because this one is under "floor decor", not plants.
---
If you can grind then grind. Some people don't have the time and an alternative way to get some of the rewards is nice. (Granted they still have to grind for bullion)
---
Feel ya. My camp is near Camden Park and there's always 2 or 3 Scorched shooting at my camp all the time 😂
---
Oh yeah
---
Yea, tis a bit of a bummer only ive you die right before you wanted to loot him.
---
This is the way.
---
You'll be seeing a lot more magic gun users popping up. They'll be the last viable option.
---
My casual bloodied handmade build does 29 damage per shot to Earle. It's insane.
---
My personal theory is that they're a distant cousin of the ghost people from Dead Money. In terms of outright hostile behavior to everything that isn't them, to their use of explosives and firearms. Yeah, Miners aren't nigh invulnerable and aren't athletic like Ghost People, but that's why I think they might be distant cousins. As well as the whole constant underground network that both have their own versions of. But that's just my theory.
---
This is the way
---
(New mandalorian season october 30th  🤘)
---
Genuinely annoyed me as well could've gotten a god roll worth a legacy for all I know
---
Bethesda is a company. Companies need money to keep providing their service. They havent made enough so they take away daily atom gains so the players will be more tempted to spend money to buy atoms. You call it a conspiracy, i call it what plenty of other businesses have figured out and been doing for years. Sure the seasons make it easier to swallow that we cant gain as many atoms anymore and sure itl help keep people playing. But they want you to keep playing so you spend money, not because they take pleasure in  providing us a service.
---
I was level 567 when I left ps4. I'm on xbox with a level 161. Totally doable.
---
Most spare plans I get I tread off to the overseers camp and drop me off right there for the low levels to enjoy
---
Why would you do this anyway? There is no more "flavor" of survival when there's no penalties for ignoring it.
---
I have it on a  chassis, not that it helps much but if I've got other PA I dont use (which I personally do) it reduces the weight for me
---
Use the perk that lets you know a magazine a nearby and explore
---
Poor misunderstood dudes.
---
You earned everyones lol
---
Could be the reason, yeah. I didn’t pay attention to that.
---
Just what i read didn't play on test. Is the pts on steam?
---
Im gonna switch to commando and use ammo factory to offset ammunition costs semi auto apparently now is outpaced by full auto according to a few different PTS users but if there is a magic gun user well rip loot
---
As a guy with one of those cliffside camps (top of seneca rocks) I endorse this message wholeheartedly.
---
My favorite new enemy.
---
They really need some quests. Would love to learn more about their weird ass miner robot hating society.
---
They're definitely smart and still seem to be people. I don't believe they're aggressive by nature, it's probably something they built their new lives/culture around like a hatred of prewar mining tech or humans for making them what they are today
---
There is nothing hard about any boss in this game save for maybe the fake Sheepsquatch because it actually has extremely simple mechanics that seem above even the "hardcore" players of this game.
---
If things were black n white they'd be so much easier to understand, unfortunately that's not how the world works. 
---
People aren't going to play or buy atoms if there isn't anything to do 🤷‍♂️
---
Yes. Neighborly is the last rank before ally.
---
&gt; With the exception on New Vegas, the development time on these games has been 7-10 years. 
---
76 was released 3 years after fallout 4.
---
Water is wet
---
A lot of people would use the perk card packs for legendary perks, a decidedly end game grind. The health kits and supply packages are the real culprits of wasted space. Don't even get me started on nukashine.
---
I thought it was assumed that they're just another form of ghoul with different means of exposure. Everything you point out pretty much puts them on the lines between feral and regular ghouls.
---
How would you begin to explain..."I dont have the required sacs for this so here I am...is there any way you have more than enough to spare for both of us?"
---
Perk cards.  Serendipity, Dodgy especially.
---
It’s definitely 5k
---
You should post this to r/falloutlore they’ll def enjoy this discussion
---
Does that still.work..? Couldn't run through the wall last time I tried.
---
Of course I will. Without challenges ,I was so close to dropping the game for good.
---
Lol. I’ve been running past globes and fans lately.
---
I wonder if party boy works with company tea. It's using whiskey... Would be a massive AP regen boost!
---
It is actually easy to achieve with some prep. To this end, I have put together a 'kit' composed of low-level legendary armor pieces, weapons, chems and food items allowing me to power-level a new toon quickly. It takes me about 2-3 days to go from level 1 to level 50 and another 3 days to get to level 100. It takes less time if you manage to do it during a double XP weekend. Note: this kit is meant for levelling Bloodied commando toons only, in order to benefit from UNY armor, along with the Inspirational perk and playing in public Building teams.
---
That’s insane
---
pored about 500- 800 rounds into the dammed thing yesterday with a furious 50 cal
---
I thought the mole-miners were children who were trapped in the mines.. i wouldn’t put child labour past Hornright or any other company in fallout tbf  (since you almost always find toys and posessions on them, as well as the occasional miners key) they also grumble ‘i dont wanna die’ and other sentences occasionally when agrod on a player
---
The Nuka I sell the most of is Nuka Scorched. They vanish pretty quick at 20 caps a piece just for display purposes.
---
By the way do as much of the quest with both before choosing. Rep grind is horrible and those missions boost it more than anything else.
---
But we got all the mods though.  Lol
---
Is that the sale that doesn't effect legendary modules?
---
Tanagra town cave, nuked, turns ores to ultracite. Cave is enclosed easy to manage space, loot the m79 and the scorch all but kill themselves. No chance for legendaries, because scorched, but silly easy. Tons of steel and flux components.
---
Are you tooold2play?
---
I would love to have Mole Miner outfits, and what's more I would love for Mole Miner outfits and Mothman Cultist outfits to make Mole Miners and Mothman Cultists respectively non-hostile towards anyone wearing them, like the faction outfits in New Vegas.
---
Or at least have the Mole Miner outfits let you understand what they're saying.
---
The commie sounds sweet for a stimpak hoarder haha! I run a Junkies build so the chems and alcohol are always nice to come home to.
---
Nice! Is there only one level of this challenge? Or does it scale after the first milestone?
---
Who cares about their Legendary cards...more Atoms means more stuff for building cooler CAMPs.
---
I can already do most things in the game without too much hassle.
---
Pretty sure Earl takes reduces explosive damage but the reduction isn’t nearly as bad as SBQ
---
This is appropriate to my feelings as well.  Nothing really pops out at me except the Lv. 99 reward.
---
It has always been outpaced, but the gap is more apparent in non-boss enemies now.
---
Ammo factory is a honey pot. You're better off taking a SPECIAL training. You can farm any ammo type you want in Daily Ops by exploiting the contextual ammo rules
---
I am a fan of the theory we were all told we were the best and brightest but in reality the entire vault was packed with invalids. Why do you think we all leave the vault with SPECIALs of 1 and our trophy case in the vault was full of awards for doing things like scubbing toilets?
---
I like how on the events page the label still says project Alpha materials even though it’s now project Bravo.
---
I.e. collect cloth below when the top says leather
---
TY..that legendary run really threw me off.i was already close to finishing the raider rep but with only a hour or 2 to play I just avoided the photo quest or the raider one.still do foundation because I just had to show up u know.
---
I don't think they will make them because the developers support and endorse death trap camps. I believe during quake con they actually showed you how you can make one. If you make a fast travel mat , you can spawn in the middle of a trap house and end up dead. I too want a fast travel mat for my camp , but at the same time , I don't want to teleport into some assholes death trap house.
---

---
Apparently, asbestos chest mod stops the fire from damaging you at all. Or fireproof 3 to delay fire damage and pneumatic chest mod to stop wendigo stunlocks. 
---
Blocker 3 to prevent wendigo oneshots. Lifebringer 3 to prevent oneshots in general. If that's not enough shoot for 30-35% max hp and swap nerd rage for first aid, then serendipity for better criticals, and add born survivor 1 to autostim you at 20% hp once every 20 seconds. Not sure if the acid is affected by poison resist, but if it is one or two pieces could help.
---
Not sure of the answer to your question, but... In my experience the only use for the cryolator as the game stands now is freezing big boss characters like the Sbq. Even Max damage for it is not particularly useful in the endgame.
---
The amount of damage is debated but it's only around 1k
---
I have had lots of success farming it when people nuke prime also, though, as long as they hit the red forest spot where the wendigo colossus sometimes spawns. There's a ton of glowing fungus there that gives you florescent flux as well. If you want the best of both worlds (event as well as farming), it isn't too shabby. Plus, the Scorched Earth event usually rewards you with stable flux anyway, so it's a little bonus on the farming.
---
I thought it was pretty clear from the Uranium Fever event that Mole Miners are super-irradiated Appalachian miners "trapped within deteriorating mining suits." The computer in UF is "detecting terminated management personnel" during the event, the legendary mole miners. The non-legendaries are the non-management workers.
---
Garrahan and Hornwright had huge operations and probably employed the plurality of Appalachia's population. A ton of those were caught during the nukes while working.
---
This is great!
---
Have you tried running an anit armor handmade paired with adrenal reaction/nerdrage? Earl has 80% damage reduction and 400 DR. It might be the way to go with the new damage calculations. Since overall damage is much lower negating super high DR is going to be important.
---
Sounds like one of the challenges that you earn once per character.  Once you reach level 50 you are awarded 50 perk coins and that is it.  I believe that is how it would work for now, unless they have further changes.
---
Haha I suggested that a few weeks ago... except I had it at lvl 100.
---
Mmmmm crab relish
---
Dang you autocorrect
---
Not with scrip limits it doesn't.
---
76 was supposed to be part of Fallout 4. That’s why so many assets and bugs from 4 are in the game, and why things like the Prydwen could be spawned into the game on pc. If this had been a brand new, stand alone game the development time would have been similar.
---
Yup. I survive Earle several times a day with my Bloodied commando toons. I rarely die during the event now. Stealth is your friend. So is an asbestos lining for your chest piece, as I discovered today 👍
---
Oh fuckin hells yes
---
don't have such low health
---
Its so awesome that we get an actual CM on these responses!!
---
It's something in the right directing
---
Mountain Scout + Glowing Skeleton mask.
---
I know it does at the moment, but it's an easy thing to expand on later.
---
I thought it was on September 15th.

I don't have one, I sold it literally the day before our character data got pulled.
---
AA will be the only way for bosses.
---
So i too have had extreme generosity.  I am a lowly, say, lvl 7.  I don't have a mic on my headset and this level 400+ shows up and just starts dropping stuff.  Like lots of stuff.  Like 2000lbs worth of materials and building supplies, meds, power armor frame, fusion cores.  He works with me for like an hour plus trying to help get me essentials and due to lack of mic was crazy patient with text messages.  Finally i was so over geared i had to bail, plus it was 1am, but still.  Another day someone just drops a bag and it has like 30 different house item plans.  Granted none with terribly helpful, but still.  Another woman just dropped a 100 stims for a lvl9 and ton of screws.  Thats been the biggest surprise of this game, how generous some folks are.
---
It’s subjective. From my view If they were to release it after the season is over, then I will no longer be grinding through any future battle pass, thus rendering the battle pass pointless.
---
That is evil and smart. How many "base plans" does a character have? You probaly still have to go through many unwanted items.
---
How do I get Chinese stealth armor? Side with settlers?
---
Is that like the leafy crap you put next to the crab on your plate?
---
Spots that are super-quick to get to, and where I’ve seen holotape games:
---
 Top of Watoga High (at the “Gnome watching a teddy bear puke” scene in the northeast corner). FT to Watoga station, and take the outdoor stairs at the school for the fastest way up.
---
 Right side of the bed at Toxic Larry’s. There’s also a magazine spot at the outhouse to the north, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a holotape game there...
---
they 'drop' a disturbing amount of glowing meat
---
Well if you are not in a power armor, you need to stay away as much as possible and...stimpaks are your best friends (dilute them).
---
If you have a power armor, the "Emergency Protocol" is pretty much a must. I mean i'm tanking Earl with this thing...as a Bloodied Heavy Gun build ! Like no joke...i'm standing right there in its face and poping stimpaks when needed.
---
I hope we learn more about them and the Interloper/Mothman cultist. I'm so curious as to what caused some of them to split off and start worshipping the Interloper over the Mothman.
---
2 can spawn at lost home
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here\_is\_why\_lost\_home\_is\_the\_bomb\_yo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/)
---
and then pop over to forward station delta. there's a chance of 2 there as well. one inside the cabin on the table and the other on the walkway with the table and ammo crate. Also a bobblehead spawns there
---
I run a PA bloodied build and my x01 with emergency protocols works fine. I try to keep an eye on my health to make sure I use stimpacks but I’ve died 3 times total in my last 4 attempts.
---
A lot of them carry things like toy cars too. On a side note,  "You'll die screaming you shit!", "Tear you apart! Spread your guts on the floor!", and "Dig straight into your eyes!" shows they're SUPER pissed
---
Also, when you get parasites, they are eating your shit.
---
I tend to stick to the center column near the railings, nothing falls on me and the railing keeps me running in place when the panic attack hits.
---
There are also some alcoves on the far side of the mine from the entrance, I can hide behind the crates when Earle is aggro'd on me and spitting acid, plus the roof cave-ins dont happen there. 
---
Positioning,  psychotats, staying stealthy, using serendipity, and shooting as many wendigo spawns as I can has worked really well for me so far.
---
Then you don't need to ask for this. You already know, put on the perk and search. 
---
But I guess you need some attention today?
---
Exactly. XD
---
But possible to get rare plans a second time.
---
Try to go for 30-40% hp and hide in the center behind the computers. Wendigo spawns are a bigger issue but a good bloodied should be able to 2-3 shot the spawns at that hp. As long as you’re maintaining the wendi horde you should be fine, but still watch your health carefully
---
Sticks to your ass and gives 300000 damage resistance
---
If someone doesn’t have time to grind, then they don’t get the reward. This shouldn’t be kindergarten, where everyone gets a ribbon. 
---
I do agree that a few lower tier rewards purchasable post season is fine, if you make the top tier reward purchasable you water the whole system down.
---
Saw someone else wearing the pink suit with a Toothy mask. It was incredible
---
This. Photomode poses and emotes should just be the same thing. You should be able to plug any pose/emote you own into any slot on the emote wheel, like the quick inventory wheel. You should also be able to select any pose/emote you own from the photomode menu. In NW/When flagged for PVP, the emote wheel could just revert to the default set of emotes to avoid any exploit concerns while still allowing micless pvpers to use emotes as a basic form of communication.
---
Power armor.
---
One issue is that people can use this to make it so that you always fall into their trap camps. Meaning you zone in, trigger the trap and die. Can't get your stuff. I don't mind trap camps, but being able to instakill players who fast travel to your camp isn't right.
---
&gt; ACP is a massive waste of time and resources
---
Yep, I ended up buying all the rewards from player vendors, because to hell with that clusterfuck of bs instakills and drain on ammo and stims.
---
Dang that’s sooner than I expected
---
Now tell him how it permanently takes up a portion of camp budget even if he deletes it later.  I think the numbers are each machine takes up 1% of the budget that he won't get back, even if he moves his camp.
---
I never missed one challange from this season and managed to finish 19 days earlier... These double SCORE challanges Will help allot
---
Both right. The Mandalorian new season.
---
There’s a couple of YouTube videos on runs around top of the world area and another run around where the big empty lake is (can’t remember any names, I’m tired) the one with the super mutant levels in the middle
---
Thats too ambitious of an idea. They really just need to replace the queen with a new boss and redesign that prime area as permanently irradiated and add to it a little. Like F4 and make it very challenging. Id settle for them moving the queen to another fissure at this point though.
---
He means mandolorian season 2
---
Anytime I see one of those bots flying around with an escort I take them down. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I think it is fine. This one seems to last 12 weeks so extra 2 weeks.
---
Odds are probably not, but I can clear west tek and server hop in the time it takes that event to start. I'd bet you could probably clear 3 or more servers in the time that event was going on.
---
Also I'm a man of little faith when it comes to doing events with randos, too many things can go horribly wrong.
---
u/nwordcountbot
---
It is strange that we can trade with one of them. Maybe she's like the ghouls who can talk and walk around.
---
This community is one of the reasons I still play the game. As a person that has also dealt with GTAO community, this one is gleaming by comparison. Destiny 2 also has a great community if youre looking for another time sink with good people.
---
Really enjoyed the positivity from this post. Thank you :)
---
I heard that they had regular sales for 50% off where legendary modules aren't part of that sale where it's a 50% off sale for items in the store, but those particular items are excluded from that 50% off sale. I really need to stock up on Broadsiders and Harpoons, I hope that this is the Broadsider &amp; Harpoon Sale.
---
&gt;Who cares about their Legendary cards.... 
---
Some people? The cool thing about this game is how you can kinda do your own thing!
---
Now I want some crab salad
---
There comes a point where fear of exploits means we should all just pack up and go home instead of even trying to have fun.
---
Shiettttt. I didn't realize that was so close either.
---
I apologize for my confusion. **I have spoken.**
---
Rocket Raccoon level logic there.
---
This, LOL
---
Run the route only picking up what you issues are missing. When you server hop remember the locations you where have taken a mag and don’t bother checking there again as nothing will spawn in that location for you until the spawns reset for you.
---
Use power armor. I run a power armored bloody build, and have fought Earl in both melee and with heavy weapons successfully. Take max Blocker, Dodgy, Fireproof perks. Equip power armor with the highest DR you can, and put Emergency protocols on the chestpiece. Earl's kicks TICKLE.
---
If you fight in melee, stack as many foods with melee damage as you can with psychotats and strength food, and drink Tick Blood Tequila. You will heal yourself each time you hit him with a melee attack. Do not let yourself stand in the orange goo or let the fire from the ceiling fall on you. The goo is survivable, but the fire from the ceiling is not. Also stay away from the acid barrels, they will kill you too.
---
If you fight with ranged weapons, stand around the central column, and try to avoid standing in places that will send you into the barrels on one side, otherwise the railing should usually keep you from running to your death into a drill, acid, etc.
---
It just went on game pass recently and lots of new people are coming at least on Xbox. I myself waited a long time to try it with all the controversy around it, and I ended up buying it recently so I'm sure there's lots of others doing the same
---
Sadly no changes against the damage nerf. I hope they'll take their time and won't publish it on the 15  september.
---
Mechanic coveralls and bog hockey mask
---
Was referring to the mandalorian,  edited for clarity
---
Is Lamant home?
---
Interesting. I think I only ever moved 1 or 2 points around ,but have lost quite a bit of cards as duplicates of maxed animated card,maybe more than 50 but still it's nice to get some back.
---
Forget the ghouls. Farm the Level 60 Sentries at the Whitesprings. If you are doing it right it’s 1500 XP per at 43 INT. Server hop and do it again. Sentries are the best XP grind IMO.
---
I think that the Scorch Queen would be way more fun if there were more Scorched spawns, more frequently. It's an open area so it's more difficult to be overwhelmed, but the fun of the Wendigo spawns is how they're going to mess up your day if you ignore them.
---
I asked for farming locations. You responded by saying I should click on a perk &amp; explore the whole map. Water is wet. Thanks for playing.
---
Why does the Red viper skin for the handmade look like the blood eagle one we just got? Did they just forget the picture for the new one?
---
So like...what exactly is the difference between the blood eagle handmade paint and the red viper handmade paint? They're both black metal with red blood splatters
---
I was a member of a couple of those aged gamer groups, then I forgot about them. LOL I'm only 45 but I've had a rich life.
---
GT = TEH RED ZMAN
---
They'll most likely refund your atoms. As long as you explain them what happened, they'll return your atoms without complaint.
---
Once I bought something by mistake, contacted support and next day I had my atoms back on my account. They even let me keep what I bought.
---
Tattered dress and the Inspectors top hat or White powder jumpsuit and a Blue Mr Fuzzy Hard hat.

Do the scrap kits send back to STASH or your scrapbox if you have fallout 1st?
---
Is it wrong I cook and eat the meat that comes off of them? I'm a hungry survivor and sometimes there isn't anything else around to hunt.
---
No shit lol thats why i havet been on in a week. Its just too bad bethesda doesnt see it that way.
---
You can get that separately free from a mission but also available for purchase later once you are ally with the Foundation for gold bullions. Just follow all the quests that Becket and Commander Guerre gives you. Then do the raid with the Raiders and it will give you the Bug Buster plasma rifle. And keep the .50 cal that Becket provides, it is a nice weapon.
---
Right, the fact that the mine recognizes the mole miners tells me that they were the miners. I assumed that they tried to take over ans occupy the mines (hence 'terminated' management personnel). These are the angry strikers. I think they tried to destroy the auto-miners in some mines - the conspiracy on the computer in the rusty pick. But there were other things. Monoghan mine where earl was trapped was different and the glass cave where the ultracite was had an explosion... Not sure who caused that one. Anyway, irradiated and trapped, they dug into the mines and expanded them, but lost some humanity and maybe sanity in the process.
---
Will try that out after I finish west tek :)
---
And their level of creepiness fits as well, I had the same thought.
---
When the goals are reached how long till the reward appers in the shop?
---
One of the Daily Ops reward is a plan to craft the Gutter using legendary modules. It was probably related to that addition.
---
Noted above, trap camps need to not really be worried about this stuff anymore. Every time the subject comes up people bring up trap camps, and that's perfectly fine but they have been nerfed enough and people are aware enough that you're either going to get killed or you're not. Again, run into a trap Camp consider what you had lost and block the user you never have to see them again.
---
I've been caught in several of them, sometimes I'll go back to try to find out how they did what they did but you can always find trouble somewhere else when you get killed.
---
The glowing ghouls used to give mad XP.
---
This is one of those things you wish had slipped the net haha, guessing it's to do with craftable Gutters.
---
Don't have a cow, I'm sure it'll autocomplete.
---
I would if i knew that part.
---
I love a few of the camps that I've seen up there but it's gotten to the point where I don't even fast travel to them anymore because I know I'm not going to get there.
---
Get a friend to upvote this so we can actually get some attention and maybe a real answer.
---
Collectron should be in the shop tomorrow, purveyor sale will be  SEPTEMBER 10 to SEPTEMBER 14, and the second week of meat week will be SEPTEMBER 22 to SEPTEMBER 28
---
I was told it's much more time consuming trying to earn the gold bullion for the Chinese stealth armor rather than just complete their quests. Can you confirm?
---
Are you a bloodied build by any chance?
---
because the only people i seem to see complaining about this change are bloodied builds.
---
There’s no farming locations. Magazines have a fixed spawn location but aren’t always the same magazine. 
---
And might not always be there. For example there’s several that spawn inside the clubhouse at Whitesprings. 
---
So the best is to put on the perk and search every marked location on the map. It’s pretty easy to just travel from one to the next nearest. 
---
Or just do a google search for magazine locations. You know that there’s lots of people that put in the effort to cover these subjects. 
---
It’s amazing how people are to lazy to do that, but are more than happy to spend time being a dick in response to an answer.
---
The point is if they make it in one of the methods I mentioned above, and some of them that other people have mentioned before, there's not really that much of a problem of big killed when you spawn in.
---
The only difference is right now people that travel to a camp and have to look for the entrance to go inside and get killed.
---
Welcome to MMO games in 2020!
---
I hate it.
---
I agree, just that more Perk Card packs when you have 200 unused and dozens of doublers made me grind my teeth when I saw them in the Run.
---
Handy for my other characters, but that was about  it.
---
Too bad they didn't use the community suggestions for what legendary perks should be.
---
Asbestos chest lining completely negates all damage from the falling embers.
---
probably less people playing it.
---
Yes, it would cost you a lot of gold bullions. Just do the quests and you will get it as a reward. As a tip don't kill the Mom in the Chinese secret cave.😁 No more spoilers.
---
So with 50 coins thats should be the first level of a legendary perk (1--&gt;2) for basically nothing correct?
---
That existed (off and on) since the beginning of the season for most people.
---
Me too. Same boat. Switched focus to the run so only really did the dailies on my days off. I finally got 2 of my characters to ally both a few weeks ago only to just do the raid with my 3rd. 
---
Fk everything people said about the gold grind, the rep grind is way worse. I split the gold with both factions this time. I don't even really remember where I started with keeping it all on my other 2 but starting half way through neighborly on both makes me much happier.
---
1343!  Nice.  Are there specific spots for them?  Or just all around?
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/p3mGTB1)'s what it looks like. Third effect is less vats cost, so they can spam this ungodly abomination even more
---
The start getting pissed because they are planning on doing it just like they did with this season.  Camp plans shouldn't be exclusive IMO
---
I agree that it's ambitious but while the general idea that runs in this sub is that Bethesda doesn't care about this game the truth is that Zenimax bought a whole studio to make this game work and heavily invested and keeps investing and it's not like the game hasn't grown after it's launch
---
They stated they are fixing that floor in Patch 22. And it's really not that bad, at least for me.
---
I recently got fo1 so I have plenty of atoms right now.  Looking at what I have now + September + October I would just need to get to level 40 (not including atoms we'll get from season 2).  I'm going to participate, but I'm going to play the game my way and not worry about building 5 floors or planting 10 ears of corn every day.
---
There's no point really saying it. People here adore the cheaters, and bethesda unbanned many people who owned these weapons during that """ban""" wave a few months ago. They are aware of it and give exactly 0 fucks
---
It wasn’t a guess, the whole seasons talk, still on the website, noted a “few weeks’ break” between seasons.
---
I like your idea.
---
durability per shot my balls can only orgasm so much.
---
this is a change that needed to be done yesterday.
---
My headcanon is that Mole Miners are essentially just feral ghouls that are trapped in their suits. Their slow, lumbering Walk is very classic zombie style, and their grunts and growls sound a lot like what I’d imagine a feral would sound like with breathing equipment bound to its face. Arguably this doesn’t explain why they can use weapons but maybe someone else could come up with an explanation for that
---
To me, that explains the purveyor a little - maybe she is to the regular MMs what a ‘sentient’ ghoul is to a feral. Maybe she found a way to escape a mine and got out before she went as crazy as the others? Maybe there’s other potentially civilised mole miners out there, or small settlements of them built in mines less affected by the radiation and the scorched plague.
---
You mention trap camps. But only that you avoid these players and that you block them so you never have to see their camps again.
---
But I also don’t want an entire foundation piece dedicated to a fast travel point. Or anything else like that. 
---
If they give us a fast travel point, all it really needs to be is a spot we place down that can’t be on top of something we built, and has to be on the ground. 
---
Then you can’t place it over a trap, you can’t place it in the air.
---
Ya it kinda blows if you don't realize it's a glitch and let someone put a bunch in your camp.  You lose the budget and if Bethesda ever wants to clamp down on it, it's going to be hard to hide the fact that your camp is filled with these things.
---
Just a fyi, if you team up with someone on a private team (not public), they can drop them all over your camp and screw you over.
---
This berserker isn’t impressed either
---
Stopping at rank 70-80 and waiting for double scores and such
---
I got it on my quantum X01 which makes me wonder why I still have my X01 helm sitting around.
---
give it another 12 days and I'm thinking the sub will be flooded with 'where did my damage go' posts.
---
double that if they manage to fix magic weapons in time for the patch.
---
The part of the silencer facing the player looks like steel got really really hot and discolored
---
cool ty :)
---
In both Uranium Fever and Lode Bearing they're attacking the automated mining devices/robots. They attack when you're going after the Motherlode too. It seems pretty clear they're the miners that hated the automation taking their jobs.
---
I usually survive him as a assassin's sentinel build with half health with 1 auto stim sent piece and one unyielding sent full sneak full explosive and bloodied tesla and handmade, serindepidy and full commando
---
Pretty much all of it is Atomic Shop.  It's the Pink Metal Armor, Valentines PA, and Pink Pip-Boy.  She also has the pink Cupid Vault-Boy backpack, but I rarely use that because it's kind of big, and the smaller gray Secret Service one goes with the gray collar on the Metal Armor anyway.
---
Usually has the felt reindeer antlers, other times the Devil Horns, which led to my nicknaming her Pinky Demon.
---
Each of my toons has a theme, that's hers.
---
Greenhouse? Me too. The only thing I genuinely REALLY want from Season 2 rewards. Sucks it's L99. I've only made it to like L78 on Season 1 and I'll have even less free time this go around. 
---
Some of the other rewards are pretty cool too, like the train set. But most of it just isn't my stylo
---
Careful if you buy the Stealth feature for the torso. I already had the jetpack on it and the stealth removed it. Apparently you can have only one mod on the torso. Someone suggested that it can be put on the limbs but that did not work out.
---
She’s great.   I like her dialog about counting the birds.
---
They like to spawn at the exterior gates randomly. But you can always find two at the main entrance and one by the back parking lot. I like to start at the main gate head out towards the railroad station and make the perimeter then head back in and hit that one last one in the back then clear out the clubhouse of ghouls and server hop. When I was doing the legendary run I could get 300-400 bonus XP SCORE in one run easily.
---
Well, looks like my rifleman will still be going full auto in two weeks....
---
Easiest way would be to just ease off to 40-50% health and/or use Vampire's for the fight. That's what I had to do a while back for Encryptid when I ran Bloodied.
---
But seriously, I would argue that Bloodied builds -should- have trouble surviving this fight. That's supposed to be the trade-off, right? Reduced survivability? If you're running around at 19% health in Unyielding for one of the hardest fights in the game, there should be some consequences.
---
Just ran into this bug. its a shame it hasnt been fixed in a months time. really a huge turn off to the game. i cant even progress in THE MAIN STORY?!
---
"Can we keep politics out of this community for a franchise that satirises the greed, hubris and brutality of America"
---
Okay, boomer
---
Double XP weekend I was getting 3500 per. Lol.
---
or just a fixed toilet and Shower, like we're not animals you know.
---
They should be both IMO
---
How do you change what they can collect? Mine only collects soup, plants, and hammers.
---
Weirdly I got into a section of fighting where suddenly it wasn’t showing me gaining XP anymore.  Not sure if visual bug.  Or something broke
---
It was still a guess, especially with Bethesda’s track record of delays.
---
YES! They're embarrassingly bad.
---
It's equally amazing how people are more than happy to spend time being a pretentious dick, 𝑛𝑜𝑡 responding to a question &amp; go "tUrN oN dA pUrK aNd SuRcH aNd gOoGle It BrOh" like what's the point of a niche community if not to ask for help? Rather than sitting through more aged YouTube videos I thought I might ask the expertise of the community very sorry for my transgessions
---
If you get yours why do you care about anyone else?
---
Oh boy, rank 29 is 12 Vintage Nukashines. 12 free caps...
---
Rank 99 is the Greenhouse set!? Gawd damn.

How much you wanna bet someone is gonna use a bunch of atoms to complete the season day 1?
---
Not done the event for a couple weeks, maybe I'll give it another go 👍

In my experience, 5.56 is the way to go. Railway spikes may be easier to craft, but i don't think the exchange rate is as good on them. For 2000 rounds of 5.56, you get 5000 converter points. That's a damn good deal
---
Whomever handles their support tickets seem to do a pretty good job. I’ve reported several of the infamous challenges that will not mark as complete (Discover Beckley, Kill the Scorchbeast queen, etc), and they credited me the atoms I should have been given for the challenges. 
---
It still shows as incomplete in game... which is annoying... but at least I got the atoms for it.
---
People *have* gotten banned over reports.  But whatever the threshold is, it's not an easy one to meet.  And they are usually unbanned in just a few days, because Bethesda doesn't take the problem seriously.
---
That would be amazing! If only
---
How do you change what they can give you? Mine gives soups, plants and hammers.
---
What  part of the 'profit' bit of his equation did you miss..?
---
Either way don't tell me I'm gonna rebuild the wasteland and then only let me build a tiny camp and workshops that you lose as soon as you leave or crash which is what happens usually when I lose my workshops it's cause it crashed for the fifth time that day
---
Excellent idea.  They should also work when you try to place them.
---
Better rewards would get more people interested instead of 2XP.
---
Good shout. I'm offline now, but will be back online later and I'll check that out
---
They have enough voiced dialogue for them to be more than feral imo
---
i've said it before. As a junkie i welcome this change.
---
Nothing for FO1st again even though they said they would be implementing it for the second season? Definitely cancelling it. Not worth the money anymore since it’s definitely been ignored since release.
---
They kind of did. Some of the perks they added between the first and second iteration were specifically asked for, like the lockpicking/hacking one.
---
Hopefully they do more frequent balancing thanks to it. I kina hope they fix the bugs on explosives/weaker legendaries
---
I hate having to kill mole miner treasure hunters but I want their loot. They don't fight back, they just flee in terror.
---
Oh god, I'm so sorry.. ;\_;
---
I have less time also, but somehow finished the run last week. It sounds like they are making more opportunities to earn score but who knows.
---
Only my response wasn’t ANYTHING like your exaggeration of it. And you’re response was to be a big dick.
---
I don’t know what rank you are, I don’t know what you know about the game I don’t know what perks you have.
---
So I gave you a decent honest answer to your question. You choose to be offended by it. 
---
And even after you keep replying like a big dick I still gave you information about magazines and spawns.
---
So the issue is all on you. Later!
---
That’s nice.
---
It’s still all grunts and groans still - maybe they developed a primitive kind of language being trapped in the mines together for so long?
---
Ah ok, i was just wondering, stumbled across a camp in the southern savage divide which owner was called tooold2play and his camp was crazy detailed and thoroughly put together. Im sure, your camp is awesome too. You old timers with your crazy camp building skills.
---
I feel ya man, I've stopped going most of the time because it's not worth it and all my nukes go to Scorchbeast Queen. Less time and resources wasted, and less aggravation.
---
That's been possible for a while now
---
When they do a double xp weekend for adventure, it also works in NW. If you didn’t know that already, you can use that to help yourself out.
---
Everything blows up! What a load of bullshit.
---
I feel mole miners are a lot like a Jawa and sand people hybrid but fallout instead of Star Wars. I’m pretty sure sand people wouldn’t be hostile if we could speak with them and they’re short and mysterious looking like Jawas plus their interactions are very Jawa like
---
Where am I supposed to weigh/cut my buffout if not in the stall?
---
Just dropping by to get confirmation that Bethesda still hasn't change the rewards here and its only beneficial for lower levels to participate?
---
As I understand it there is nothing new so my level 456 ass won't receive the chance of earning something fast and cool, rather the same old shit that I already have.
---
Less people are playing because they removed the unintended limited time rewards from Chrstmas and Halloween. 
---
I stopped once I got them all.
---
Maybe, but when I use my flamer I don't get frame rate drops and that makes ash piles too.
---
Yes I've a bloodied build like 70% of everyone who like to do high damage.
---
But you question is wrong, you need to ask me if I use Rifle/Pistol/Energy/Explosive/1H/Unarmed weapon, because that're the weapon which will be obsolet after the nerf. 
---
I think it's okay to nerf bloodied but making literaly almost any build to trash is just stupid.
---
And no I won't have a problem after the nerf since I've automatic/Heavy guns/legacy weapons. But I would hate it that I'm forced to use a special build or weapon. 
---
Fallout is and will ever be a game for me where you can play how you like it.
---
You can just move your camp device to a different spot and spawn there
---
I am, maybe I should add some kind of flair
---
You don't like waiting for 4 minutes to find a match because there's so few people playing NW?
---
I finished the run a few weeks ago. But when that challenge showed up before that is exactly what I did and yes it did work.
---
Ig I didn't really notice til a month ago when it became persistent
---
Yes just finally finished it. Beaten zorbo it ends in a few days anyway not long to wait
---
Recent fallout games (4 and 76) use different mutants that probably haven't even heard of the master, let alone come from him
---
Free ammo and tp?
---
I'll stick with my PA and the related perk cards for it that I use.  Otherwise, yeah, this would be the way to go although I have never died from the falling fire.  It hurts and lost health but no deaths.  Yet.
---
&gt;I'm not og like some of you brutes
---
Rude, I consider myself more of a troglodyte than a brute
---
When Bethesda taking action appears to be the exception to the rule, they really aren't taking it seriously at all.
---
That’s a nice addition. I’d like to see more challenges that award perk coins upon completion.
---

I have played ALMOST every day since launch, since I have a full time job and kids. But I’m only level 492. Then again, I didn’t fully spec into intelligence, or use experience buffs. That being said, level 1000, without cheats is crazy. I’m not saying it’s not possible. But someone must play for over 8 hours a day, every day to hit that. Just my opinion.
---
LOL the hubba hubba is the part that got me.. but very true gotta cut the buffout and TP is in need
---
I honestly don’t understand why it doesn’t just use the vendor interface instead of this stupid terminal.
---
A kitchen sink too. We know the kitchen counter and sink exist
---
My alt is only at level 15.my main acct is basically a god right now.all unyielding ss armor a few guns that I'm sure are d;%ped that I couldn't pass up while trading and now I am dreading having to level up my alt.ill def split that gold!
---
I'm usually in a live NW match in under 6 minutes total, so the "wait" never really bothers me.
---
They need to see this
---
OP is wanting more people to invest time in NW.
---
never in my life have I seen someone dislike damage as much as you do.
---
I guess you're roleplaying as a pacifist hippie, spreading the love through chems.
---
Lmao I've seen this dont remember the location.
---
NW is only popular during limited time events because thats the only time people are desprate enough to bushwookie it up.
---

---
Damage reduction multipliers are unchanged, as are incoming damage multipliers like the Tenderizer perk, sneak and soft spot bonuses like e.g. head shots on humanoids.
---
50 perk coins is equivalent of 14 levels + 6 perk coins
---
Probably a visual bug. Another way you can keep track of XP gains is by making the repeatable XP gain an actively tracked daily/weekly. Then you get a pop up for each kill as it tracks against the 10k. It does however get behind especially if you get kill happy at Wes Tek.
---
This was stupid.
---
Stealth my freind.trying to overpower him and his minions is alot harder than finding that perfect spot where he cant see you.sneak damage is almost a 3x multiplier so it turns a 10 min battle into 3.5
---
I occasionally like to rock up a public event wearing my responders fireman outfit
---
I have yet to use an Gauss weapons.  
---
I prefer the silent, stealthy, deadly approach.
---
Go down once early on and have somebody with the injector perk revive you. Problem solved
---
GET READY TO GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!!! HE'S ALMOST DONE IT!!!
---
DONT CLICK THE LINK ITS A VIRUS
---
Again, to each their own. I've done my fair share of Wes Tek runs, but to me it gets boring fast. I'd rather literally just wander around random spawn locations looking for a good time than doing Wes Tek more than once or twice a week. 
---
I see a public event pop up, I'm gonna do it. If there's 1 person, maybe more people will join, which will inspire more to try. That more people think like you, "Why bother, no one is going to show up?", it's why these events are dead. Not blaming you specifically or anything, of course. There's however many people on a server generally and it's almost only ever me and 1-2 other people in an Event. 
---
I just don't see why people complain about not having enough events, when they just don't do the ones that are there in the first place.
---
You don't seem to understand what a lie is.
---
Apart from the gas mask with hat I have 0 will to farm any of that guess Im safe
---
They have their ups and downs. With some topics they just send you a copy and pasted generic response that couldn't be more useless, and feels like they didn't even care to read your ticket and was sent by a bot.
---
With this I can't complain. They were really nice and was solved in less than 24h.
---
Probably because a majority of the player base hates the food/water mechanic. 
---
Personally I can't stand it. Its just an annoying feature that I have to deal with every 10-15 minutes. There is no challenge because the game is constantly throwing food and water in your face.
---
I like the idea of removing the debuffs and leaving in food bonuses. It means I can dump all of the canned dog food and purified water I drag around and only use food when I want the bonus stats.
---
What system and what country are you in?
---
I just picture you shopping, looking through all the vendor machines, while completely ignoring the fact that you are shitting just EVERYWHERE.
---
\*horrifying shitting noises\* "Excuse me, but do you have this in blue?"
---
Read that bit the other guy added. I gues each one permanetly take up 1% of your budget. A small price to pay if you ask me.
---
Pipe is Life
---
This game guy dropped a weapon that had two prefixes.  It was an anti armor furious handmade. It had other perks.  Then he told me he made it.
---
I don’t like or use power armor. So I don’t really know too much about it. 
---
But for a bloodied build such as myself, it’s very useful.
---
So I can have just the frame on my table instead of on the wall.
---
ok
---
I have one because I wanted to make one that looks like my wife.
---
It's an odd interface design choice for sure.
---
Unfortunately it just leaves me with stacks of unused ammo that I'm waiting to hit a critical mass. Realistically that means it just hangs around in my storage and I forget about it after a while.
---
Why does gender matter either with a game character or real life?
---
I don’t think it’s that skin is showing, that’s the blood eagle one from season 1
---
I believe that’s the case
---
I would say that some outfits look better on a female than a male and vise versa. Or it could be for story reasons like some people will make a back story about there in game player.
---
Yeah [here’s ](https://youtu.be/f7pSKBuVIiE) a vid for it. This method should get u the tnt dome key 2 the quickest also it goes over some of the story as it was meant to be found (presumably).
---
Because dudes are weird and have some issue about staring at a dude's behind all day. At least that is the historic answer to this question. I mean I'm in PA all the time anyways, so who really cares?
---
Unfortunately it doesn't work. Moved it to about 40 different places in my Camp over the course of three hours with a couple friends of mine fast traveling to it and it only moved their spawn area by about 12 feet in a circle. 
---
I think this old trick works for camps with smaller foundations or are smaller overall, doesn't work at my Camp anymore.
---
I create every character in every video game in the image of my now nine-year-old daughter. That way, she’ll have my accounts, trophies, and characters for the classics when she’s old enough to play them.
---
How are you finding out they are guys in real life?
---
Honestly, couldnt tell you why I do. But I'm kind of split down the middle. I have 10 toons, 5 male 5 female. 🤗
---
It’s not paranoia if you’re right.
---
Id play more NW if they added more maps. Im sick of Morgantown every damn game.
---
I play on third person view and i don't want to look at some dudes ass all day long. That said, i do play both genders depending on my mood and rp reasons.
---
The outfits for female characters look better than the male ones
---
Probably some crappy .38 special
---
In game lore explains it...
---
I have five characters. Two are women, and I like to mix it up. One character is modeled on myself, the rest are kinda random. The funny part about the female characters is that some people have gotten quite mad about “getting killed by a girl” screaming shit over their mics. On the other hand people gift way more stuff to the females. So it’s a mixed bag....
---
Hahaha, thanks. I think I've got the only fully automated gun range in Appalachia at this point.
---
I will have to look him up, I am located about 25 yards south of the Southern Fence of the gorge junkyard in the forest. North of the road but south of the river Oxbow.
---
I'm one of those guys that like to go and give the new players a couple of plans or a weapon if they are polite and need it. We got to have our folks properly trained and armed if they're going to help restore Appalachia to its former glory
---
About 300 with my super shotty
---
The clean version of the greaser jacket and jeans from the atomic shop
---
must. know.
---
That makes sense.  I'm with you mostly.  I only use PA for SBQ and Earl when I know I am going to be using my heavy weapons and want the Stabilize card to kick in along with the other PA benefits.  All other times, I'm a full health Vanguard kind of player.
---
I'm a bloodied build. I'm offended.
---
At first it was in the crafting menu but you couldn't actually craft it.  If you dropped it, you got a message saying you could craft a new one. Eventually, it just disppeared from the crafting menu.  The only thing Bethesda ever said about it was a response to someone's tweet.  They  said that it was never intended to be crafted and that having it appear in the crafting menu was some kind of bug.
---
I think it was meant to be crafted but the crafting part got messed up somehow. Because the helmet is rare(ish) they figured there's not enough people pissed off to result in a signifacnt backlash so they just decided to blow it off instead of fixing it.
---
Even if that's not how it happened, it sure as hell looks like it.  Which is why I think Bethesda would have been better off just making the damn thing available for crafting.
---
I'M COMING ELIZABETH!
---
Why not both?
---
[He stayed up there the entire fight](https://imgur.com/xbp3VzR)
---
Just why?
---
It doesn't bother me really, a game is the ideal place for role playing as someone different. There can be many and different reasons for everyone. 
---
I am a girl, with a female character, but people call me dude all the time, apparently taking for granted that I am a dude with a female character XD.
---
From what I have theorized about the mole miners is that they are the remnants of the mining community of the area known now as ash heap. When the bombs fell they were either trapped beneath the surface or used the mines as makeshift bomb shelters to escape the fallout, taking themselves and their families down with them.
---
Not knowing whether the surface was habitable due to high radiation they stayed down in their mines for 25ish years and dug tunnels to other communities like themselves.
---
Over time due to radiation  and most likely ultracite exposure ( ores turn to ultracite when nuked) their forms evolved into the mole miner. I also suspect that a little bit of FEV was involved, places like west-tec most likely dumped it's waste within the mining tunnels or it seaped into the mines from sewers or the soil itself further accelerating the process of transformation.
---
Everything they ate would've been contaminated (mole rats and fungi), due to their environment clean fresh air could  be poisonous to them, they need the toxins/dust of the mines to breath properly
---
A sweep of ones inventory when they log on, remove all all items that do not belong legit in a players inventory.  
---
Clean Mr.Fuzzy outfit = Gone  
---
Hacked in weapons with effects + dmg mods = Gone  
---
Camps that lag out the entire map because they float in air above Whitesprings? = GONE!  
---
I love this game though, we be awesome to see some things like these cleaned up.
---
in non-online games, its usually for RP or story reasons. for example, after playing Dragon Age 1 and 2 as a male, i decided why not have DA Inquisition's character be female and see how the story goes. turns out it's easier for me to put myself in the character's headspace the more i distance myself from them, and making them a different gender is one way of doing that.
---
in online games, though? no idea. i can only assume they're playing third person and like how it looks.
---
the damage output in this game is WAY too high though for the enemies it has.
---
Ha.  :)
---
Dang, a real one? I didn't know they really existed.  My buddy (Bloodied) rolled a BER25DR Fixer yesterday at ACP and I had to convince him not to scrip it.
---
Edit: Berzerker's fixer, not Bloodied.
---
It's just more fun playing as a female character, for me it might have been playing a game like Tombraider where you were forced to play as a female character, or GTA, where the females have better clothes than guys, idk. For me all my future characters are female. Much more fun playing the opposite sex.
---
In FO4, I had 1 male which was probably made to look like me, but then I just opted for all female characters since then. Female characters just look better in certain gear, but at the end of the day it really shouldn't matter and you can't assume one way or another if they female or male but it shouldn't matter too much.
---
I am sure females probably have male characters, although I might be wrong, who knows.
---
It is even more interesting when I see crossdressers next to the Wayward, waiting for new players to drop by.
---
I'm not saying I want the foundation, I'm saying that that is one way around all of the reasoning we're ever given. 
---
All we need is to have them make the existing fast travel mat that is at the workshops available in our camps. 
---
Let the users weed out the folks that they want to visit or not if they end up at trap camps. 
---
If what they're really worried about is trap Camp's and griefing, there are other ways to do it. The phone booth I mentioned would be perfectly doable. Foundation piece with the mat on it would be doable. You don't have to use it if you don't want to, but for those of us that do, we should be able to.
---
I have  5 characters, two which are female. I rolled two female characters because I wanted to make use of some of the outfits in the game like the asylum dresses, rocket girl costume , mistress of mystery etc. A dress on a guy just doesn't work for me...lol
---
Although I generally don't roll female characters,  its no different playing games like Tomb Raider, Assassins' Creed, etc. where the main character is or can be a female.
---
I've come across my share of women that play as males too,  it all depends on how you want to play the game. 
---
For me its nothing more than a change of pace.
---
The video i've seen of the bloodied "nerf" had a commando still doing silly damage against a sheepsquatch.
---
Their voices, in all likelihood.   It's how I found out about one.
---
Module weapons are non tradable, so that fixes that.
---
It’s niche for sure. But viable and fun if challenging and occasionally limiting. But it will be a lot less fun if the only advantage is taken away.
---
That said, if that last bit of the fixer your friend got is damage resist.... then it may be scrip. It may have changed since Wastelanders but in the past any DR effect on a weapon has weird and unpredictable effects on berserker weapons.
---
This is the right answer.
---
My take is that the 50 free perk coins is the real win here.
---
I'm convinced that Aries from the Blue Ridge Company is a recovered mole miner. I made a post about it on here a while ago and was surprised that it was actually pretty well received.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hgzyen/could_aries_from_the_blue_ridge_caravan_company/
---
My main is always the male.  But if games allow for multiple toons I swap genders.  
---
For fo76 I went m/f/m/f/m.   Why I choose a different gender? Cause I can and variety.
---
Probably by talking to them????? How the heck else
---
Because women get shortchanged in the Apocalypse.
---
perhaps the same reasons why some girl gamers pick the male bodies. could be-
---
\-Personal preference
---
\-how outfits look on some bodies
---
\-the wonder of trying to understand the opposite sex
---
\-Dat Butt
---
\-because they can
---
Role playing at it's core. F76 only has two choices, male or female. I would love to play as a super mutant or mole miner. Some outfits are suited more for female characters. Besides, I don't like the way a red dress looks on me, but have no problem letting Beckett sport it.😁
---
when i wanna be goofy, or during fasnacht/mischif night, i do the spacesuit plus Moonshine Mama fasnacht mask. fits my "SpaceZombie" name.
---
when i wanna be serious, i tend to rock the raider pathfinder face mask, piper's goggles, a Vault 76 trucker hat, and the mountain scout outfit.
---
and during meat week, i switch to bloody chef's hat and apron. even if im not doing the events.
---
i'll play..
---
guy with 3 toons.
---
2 males 1 female.
---
Many years ago in the original fallout game, your gender and build had an impact concerning carry weight and stealth.
---
always had a tank, a thief and a sniper. i no longer have the stats but it seemed the roll *rng gods always seem to favor women, for crit hits or locks. I dont know why they just do.
---
been playing this way ever since. sniper or thief is always a chick.
---
tanks and DPS, guys.
---
Mole Miners are the best! I love the way they hobble towards me unarmed and then their death screams, which I can only describe as, "AAAAAAAAARRRRRRHKAJDGJKABLJSDFHALFDHSDJL" It's just too great. I'm all for more Mole Miner lore.
---
Seems like the game server should be capable of scanning a player’s inventory and stash for impossible combinations and removing them when a user logs in
---
I’m still kinda annoying with the dmg still being messed up like it is for example I’m Bloodied heavy gunner and my gun still is useable but a commando build can put on 9 special points into commando perks and only get 36 dmg is absurd and why I think it’s still messed up and they don’t care
---
I keep other players mics muted, so that didn't immediately occur to me
---
“Scrap all x ammo”
---
“Buy as much x ammo that I can”
---
Where x is the ammo you select. 
---
Why are these not options???
---
I watched
---
I would be happy if they would just let us scrap it for resources. If you use ultracite ammo you're just SOL because the converter wont make it, so its not of any use.
---
At lease if it was reduced to resources I could use it to make whatever I needed.
---
I assume the writers had all sorts of grand plans that got scrapped due to budget/time/Bethesda caring more about other titles. Like you can glitch in to the presidential suite in White springs and its completely modeled but there's no indication Bethesda is ever going to open it up.
---
they really don't get what the issue is...
---
We are showing our age

Any more dude is unisex
---
Are you serious? I literally gave you the link with the info.
---
Thats the telltale sign of a sooper dooper

Far fewer people now that most have finished the legendary run and don't care about the extra SCORE.

This is the mindset to have. It's a game, enjoy what it has to offer

I'd rather have a non-loading screen elevator, but a catapult would be a great defense item.

Its a camo colored skin for handmade. Same model as Screaming Eagle.

Because I can't even stand being myself in real life - I don't want to be myself in games, too.  
---
The further removed from me the better, or else it doesn't cut it as far as my escapism requires.
---
I remember seeing that, but now it’s updated to red viper skin for the handmade
---
If you reach rank 100 and hoard your atoms you’ll end up with 2000 atoms. Worth it for me.
---
If you are fighting Earle I found sitting on the middle platform is good because no DoT can get you there and the railings protect you from being feared into a drill or a DoT pool and if you cripple Earle and sit next to the pillar of rock  in the middle you can avoid us ranged attacks by hiding when he spits and still hit him alot
---
what if I told you all the vendors in the game share caps?
---
very early on they didn't and it was a real PITA going around to scrape 200 caps from each faction's vendors
---
Yeah, I guess you're right, but "man" is pretty much unequivocal XD. Either way, it doesn't bother me, I'm here to play the game.
---
Nice to hear.
---
Oof. This is going to be a shitstorm. Shitnado. Every 76 forum is going to be flooded with whining about the damage adjustments for at least a week, and it may noy even stop. It's gonna be really rough for pistol characters(which already have the shit end of the stick with their entire class of weaponry being wholly inferior and Tank Killer won't change that) and melee requiring Good with Salt permanently slotted now to keep those food buffs ready for pretty much every encounter.
---
If magic weapons are fixed on top of this, participation in endgame events is going to plummet.
---
Sheepsquatch outfit and the white raider cask mask
---
No idea honestly, it's really weird imo. Especially when they try to make them look super good or wear some super revealing clothing. The super creepy ones are the guys who have a complex backstory for their toon or referring to them as an actual person. 
---
The only time I ever did it was in Fallout 4, because parts of the game changed depending on your gender. But in an mmo I have no idea why. I guess it's just something to look at? 
---
Guess it just boils down to the fantasy of having your own idealized female.
---
Based on the holotape you can find in the Purveyors shop by the front door I think the Mole Miners were workers of Hornwright or whatnot, but were a specific class that wore mining suits. Let’s say while on the clock Hornwright would lock the suits for whatever ridiculous anti worker reason, then when the bombs fell they got trapped in the mines and in their suits because they were never “released” from work at the end of their shift.
---
MAYBE, all this happened but in Vault 63..
---
Or maybe something similar to this, I’m not sure. I just really want more lore for them too.....
---
Where do you get it
---
I have two 450+, a 358 and a 235.  All perfectly legit, I've never done any god mode glitches or the like.  While not a 1000, I'm pretty sure I could be there if I had focused on just a single toon.
---
All your suggestions seems to involve objects in the camps. Which means players either have to have it in their camp or go without to avoid being teleported into a trap.
---
And while I don’t think the idea of setting a zone-in spot is wrong. There’s better ways than objects. Like how I suggested. There’s an option in you camp build menu. It’s an invisible circle that you can place in your camp. It can’t be placed on other build items, only on the ground.
---
Then you haven't been paying attention. The changes affect all builds with more than one outgoing damage buff, which means effectively *all* builds. The more buffs you stack, the more you are affected. Bloodied builds should expect on average a 40-45% reduction in outgoing damage, which will still put them at somewhere between 75% and 100% more damage than the next best (Junkie's). Anti-armor and Furious will be about the same, sharing 3rd place.
---
Commandos and heavy gunners will probably notice a slight increase in ammo use but not many other negative effects. The builds that will be hit the hardest are likely those that largely rely on one-shotting mobs, i.e. Rifleman snipers with gauss, lever-action and hunting rifles, as well as melee builds.

Nah. Lol. Just like designing new builds, and I've been playing since beta. I just wish they'd have upped the number of characters on one account. But after a year of waiting, I caved and just used my old ladies xbox account to make more characters. Its nice having a variety of different toons to play, only drawback is my atomic shop stuff and my F1st isn't shared between the two.
---
It is pretty bad to me just because I'm ocd and want it to look right and everything is floating a good six inches off the ground as if Cris angel is mind freaking all my furniture in it lol
---

It's crazy that NW hasnt been worked on for ages. The last real update was Morgantown as far as I know.
---
~~Okay Robin~~
---
Lots of people have respeced builds in the past with the thought in mind that ,thats what extra levels are meant for because legendary perks wasnt a thing at the time.
---
Than bethesda came up the a legendary perk system that utilizes the scrapping of excess perk cards to rank up legendary perk cards.
---
If a player used 50 saved levels (which is 50 perk cards) to respec in the past, than they would be out 50 perk cards. This is bethesdas way to help get those players back SOME of those lost perk cards.
---
1850 I think.
---
No one plays it
---
90% of the community behind this game is amazing. in fact the community is the reason i play this game still. i’m always running into kind hearted people. i’m glad you got to witness the kindness too🤟🏻

How to improve nuclear winter:
---
- remove %damage weapon perks (commando, etc).
---
*all these do is limit your weapon selection, which is counterintuitive in any battle royale. No other game has this stupidity. Make them grant extra range, better recoil, reload rate, anything that isn't plain extra damage*
---
- reduce the height of Frog Legs by 50%. Add Marsupial mutation back in.
---
- add explosive resist to the armors
---
- add xp for looting containers, dealing damage and taking damage.
---
*anything to remove incentive to be a bush*
---
- disable photomode 
---
- make build mode automatically exit after placing your turret/wall
---
This.  5.56 wins because the ammo generator generates it so much faster than the other ammo types.  It only takes about 30 minutes to get 200 rounds.  For .45 as an example, it would take nearly all night to get 200.
---
If you are straight crafting it, I don't think any particular type would stand out.
---
Because male players think I’m a girl when I put on the rocket girl suit and I pretend to be a noob so they drop good stuff for me for free. Then I hop on the mic and say “thanks fir the legos bruh” and then split.
---
Can't check PTS right now but i think i saw the camo one with different name on PTS today, not that red viper. Hard to tell with bethesda, that page saying different thing than in game PTS. Could be that they are planning to put the camo one to atomshop and give out the recolored handmade skin and renamed it that viper thing. With lazy copy/paste from this season.
---
Less goofy stuff, more gritty stuff

What does your wife think of your impression of her? I did this before, but gave the toon my wife's name (for no reason at all), she saw the toon and didn't appreciate I used her name for that toon.

Happy cake day as well.

Quote from Valseek on the PTS
---
*Hi,* 
---
*No, the damage bonus calculation changes are not intended to make the game seem harder. Previously, the way damage scaled with all the buffs you could accumulate through Perks, legendary effects, food, etc., etc., was pretty unwieldy to work with from a development perspective. The changes that are in the PTS right now greatly simplify how those bonuses affect your damage. As a result, we have a much better path forward to make smarter and more effective balance changes (and buffs!) These changes look like nerfs right now, but they are changes we needed to make as we continue to work on the game and make it even better.
---
I know it's frustrating right now that you're dealing less damage than before, but it opens up more possibilities in terms of balance for us going forward. Will definitely be bringing all of the thoughts folks have been sharing here on the damage bonus changes in the PTS to the dev team. Will let you know what I hear back.* 
---
*Thank you!*

PS Im a handgun main and am looking forward to this.

When I was younger I was friends with a slightly feminine boy that only played as the female characters in video games. Just something he liked to do
---
Right, I remember that camo one being the reward but the site has it being a different skin. You think they changed it or it’s bugged on the site?
---

As for the scrip get it up to max 1,000 . Purveyor 50% off sale in a few weeks I believe.
---
I've got a Brahmin launcher
---
Most of the girl gamers I know play as male characters. It literally doesn't matter.
---
I use female right now because I'm sick of hearing the male grunts I've been hearing since fallout 3
---
To put a jetpack on limbs you need to buy the camo skin for the power armor
---
Railway spikes, for .50 cal you even spend less steel, then you get back in ammo after conversion versus crafting not even counting other resources
---
The Treasure Hunters were cute.  I'd like to see them re-introduced as traveling merchants that are not hostile.
---
The "magic" bug or however people call it will trigger on some of the variants, resulting in very quick kills. Don't now if the fixer can reach the fire rate to get the glitch running.
---
Same...
---
I always assumed they were some sort of mix up of man and molerat now.  And there is some brood queen down there with a plan to take over the surface.
---
Bad battle Royale.
---
%damage perks for specific weapons and frog legs have no place in a battle royale.
---
It was shit before it even launched.
---
I recall New Vegas having a system where you could break down ammo to component resources. I didn't exactly dig deep into the particular numbers of that system, but I recall it working out okay.
---
It'd be nice if we could do something similar. Like even if we could just recoup a third the resources that go into making the particular kind of ammo, that'd be huge because it'd clean out a crapton of spare bits laying around.
---
???
---
He's right.  ***YOU DESTROYED THE ENTIRE APPALACHIAN ECONOMY, YOU FIEND!!***
---
(At least until tomorrow.)
---
I'm not talking about abusing bugs with "magic" weapons. That's cheating. None will do more damage than them. And they will be eventually fixed. I'm talking about legit weapons. And no, doesn't work on fixers.
---
Besides the Weight bench and the BoS bunker, just a bunch of commie crap. Too bad the bunker isin't an Atomic Shop item instead
---
What actually do legendary modules do? I can hazard a guess, but I don’t really know.
---
There have been plenty of exploits to get xp. Plus double xp weekends and nuking WS used to give a ton
---
Just use a spring trap...
---
I could care less if the brotherhood show up! But I’ll take their stuff
---
Whiskey. Nuka Cola. Nuka Quantum.
---
I couldn't find it in the calculator, is the lmg used in PA?
---
Or you could use sparklers in a bush
---
Thanks for all the comments. There was some useful information here. Much appreciated.
---
The alternative is Aries could've been a raider who formerly lived in Big Bend and didn't die with the rest.
---
Everyone gets hit by the change.
---
Yes it is
---
Yes it’s a heavy gun and u need strength for heavy weapons
---
Will try that, thanks for the advice. Can you explain why the current Atomic Blast paint will not do the same?? Why would the camo skin make a difference??
---
My advice would be to buy the SS Chest Piece and the Jetpack (you did).  Then Legendary Modules.  Craft yourself a good chest piece and then work toward the rest of the set.  You can use the jetpack even if your limb armor is not SS.
---
If you have enough gold, get the buttressed and Asbestos lining for it.
---
Buy as many Legendary modules each day as you can.
---
After all of that, grind rep to Friendly with the settlers and grab the Gauss Shotgun.
---
Once you have those things, then grind at the other gold items that you might be interested in one by one.
---
It's also not "abusing" a bug. It randomly start when firing at an enemy with a high-fire rate weapon with certain legendary effects.
---
I wish there was a way to make them. When we kill animals they drop hides.  It’s be cool if we could make taxidermy stuff that way
---
Go to the terminal on the side and change the mode.
---
I actually enjoyed that. It made me move to parts of the map I normally wouldn't go to.
---
You're right, I didn't think about that.
---
Buy all the plans for SS armor. They can then start dropping from the purveyor after you learn them (it will still be rare, but its possible). Even without the mods, they are some of the best armor in the game. Buttressed mod is the highest resistances for it. You 'll need legendary modules for making the armor pieces if you don't want to take your chances from the purveyor. You can spend your scrip on those (they have not been included in sales in the past, don't know if that will change).
---
At ally with the Raiders you can buy the plan for the ammo maker with bullion.
---
There are still two other weapons that grant modules. Those ones grow on trees.
---
LMG is a heavy weapon and benefits from stabilized perk, which i used in the calculation as it increases the damage of heavy weapons when in PA "Stabilized: In Power Armor, heavy guns gain excellent accuracy and ignore 45% armor". You can use LMG without PA but it won't be as effective and will do less damage because of that perk.
---
Would make a lot of sense, possibly as part of the BoS stuff. With the one wasteland update, could also do with armour and weapons to going up to lvl 100
---
The power armor looks incredibly generic this time, one of the most dull paints yet. Way too much commie crap as well, but there sure are a lot of really cool camp objects I can't wait to get. That mind blown emote will also be nice for using when someone has an awesome camp design, I bet. I enjoyed the first season so having a new one will be fun but overall there's much less I'm excited to get this time around.
---
Every time the queen goes down, as soon as I'm done looting her I make a beeline for the grove. With Green Thumb equipped, I walk away with about 50 raw flourescent. If I'm nuking on my own private server, though, I choose Whitespring because it also includes plenty of opportunities for stabilizers.
---
I know, but I couldn't find it in the calculator, thanks for telling me.
---
Are you getting less than 60? If so, try unlocking the framerate.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/how-to-unlock-your-framerate-in-fallout-76
---
If we hit the goal the event page says the sale will be from sept 10-14th
---
Yes the lmg is a heavy gun. You can absolutely make a bloodied build without strength if you’re doing a rifleman/commando build, but you’ll need points in strength if you want any melee, shotgunner, or heavy gunner build for the damage perks
---
Xbox? I have a launching platform in my camp
---
It's there in the perks section if you have a heavy gun selected
---
Im not entirely sure why. I dont know how long its gonna be until they fix it, so be quick
---
I think the CMs are great, but this sounds like spin to me. A lot of things promised by Bethesda employees have proven to be spin. Remember "16 times the detail?" Promises and claims with nothing backing them shouldn't be taken at face value. Pass it onto the team. Until I see more than a promise, I'm not eager to believe.
---
XP is based on a "npc difficulty curve" and modified further by max HP. 
---
HP has two components:
---
- Base HP
---
- HP/Level
---
Great post. I've glitched into the basement area with the 2nd mole miner and it currently goes nowhere.
---
Game has to be full screen. Not windowed not window borderless.  
---
Also game kinda runs like ass so turn settings a bit down.
---
Chally

Ive experienced the same. Like one shot will do ~600 and all others ~250

This is the video I use.

Cool, thanks,  I have been eyeballing that camo anyways and have atoms burning in my pockets.😁
---
Bloodied lever user checking in head shots 385, torso 190, legs 90.
---
My lever has extra limb damage and I have 2 points into tormenter. He spends alot of his time crippled and laying down so head shots are easier for everyone in the fight.
---
I try to be the first guy down the shaft as I have covert equipped and can usually get around 5 sneak shots off (around 750 each.)
---
This is fucking bullshit. No wonder this game flopped.
---
Low INT build and it shows
---
The legendary effects that cause the "magic" effect are bugged and are causing unintended damage when fired. Thus using one knowingly is abusing a bug, as you are using a bug intentionally to gain benefits and do more damage than intended.
---
Hmmm im gonna start doing that
---
Nice got my scrip maxed just hoping modules are 50 % off but I doubt it .
---
So identical level / identical
---
Mobs can have different HP base?
---
LOL, and have you all miss out on that mental image
---
Why would you buy the arm mods? Melee power armor is a gag weapon
---
Data miner here. It's 5k
---
I have more then one two shot broadsider - we might be able to make this work at scale
---
That would defeat the entire purpose of the purveyor
---
Quack outfit+ surgical mask+bottle cap glasses +black prospected hat. That’s what I use
---
Wait a few weeks, they'll be adding lunchboxes for 100 GB each
---
This is great and should be an every 50 levels thing.
---
I know it doesn't add that much damage but there isnt any other intelligence perk that i actively need all the time.   
---
So i run demo 90% of the time for that extra damage and take it off when i need other cards.  
---
I run 15 intelligence for more exp gains.  
---
but yes if you dont want to change cards all the time then its not a big deal to use a lower rank demo.
---
Only outfit i need is my BIRTHDAY SUIT
---
I think this game has the friendliest gaming community of all games I've been to. Never have I met so many mature, helpful players and so much generosity and respect. This game really brings out the best in people - love it.
---
6 SPECIAL
---
Anything else is bad
---
Ive heard that unlocking it make you move faster is this still a issue or not anymore?
---
No
---
My chemist wants his meth lab.
---
I think so.
---
I still think its a step forward. I see it like this, theyve finally broken the FO4 mold. I think theyve come to realize that the way damage was handled in a single player game doesnt work in a large scale multiplier game. To me  it seems like its the first stepping stone to direct 76 towards feeling more like a true online game. 
---
Single player games , especially modable ones like FO4, balance doesnt matter, you can make it into anything you want. An online game is different, especially looter shooter/rpgs like this one. You need to have a sort of balance. Balance gives players the freedom to use the build they like but still be able to contribute in a meaningful way.  So if re doing damage calculations facilitates this process than im all for it.
---
The only build you can pretty much do is commando.   The other builds can't even mach the commando build.
---
It’s all about belief and a bit of patience my f(r)iend. 
---
You have to meditate on the wall for a bit longer.  
---
See the wall. 
---
Pause and contemplate the universe for one second. 
---
Become the wall.
---
There is no wall.
---
It’s important to note there are hacked weapons and magic weapons. Magic weapons are drops you can get in the game, there’s nothing insidious about them. 
---
Hacked weapons are things like beam splitting handmades.
---
Nah, explosives are far better
---
Melee, heavy, or rifle/commando?  
---
And what’s ur load out.  The only thing 1 shooting my bloodied melee is earls kick.  
---
Other then that pay attention to ur health and spam them stims.
---
Interesting discussion... I'm a woman as well playing Fallout 76 and I have asked myself this question all the time. For some reason it seems to be more common for a male player to pick a female character, than it is for a female player to pick a male character. Nothing wrong with it at all, but it is an interesting "phenomenon" :-)
---
Anyway, my character is female as me, and oh my god, I saw so many "females" when I first launched the game, thinking "oh, cool - a lot of other gamer chicks like me in here"... pfft nah :)
---
Pretty sure it's because of the recent update - they have made it so it's a min of 50-51 players per match now. Before the min was around 25+. 
---
That's probably why it feels like its taking longer per match.
---
The main reason people do the Possum Scout stuff is for Backpack mods.  But the thing is, the Chemist Backpack for reaching Allied status with the Raiders outclasses all of them and has a reliable way of acquiring it, unlike the really lousy odds of Stings &amp; Things and the toxic cleanup Daily.
---
Yes - some are cloned npc records with different stats or loot.
---
Iirc, boss crown affects xp in some way
---
Didn't take up my budget. All I had to do was move my camp when someone placed one in mine.
---
A very gracious hacker has bestowed your account with atoms.
---
I thought it might be the boss crown.  But started paying attention and it wasn’t.  Was weird.
---
None. I just use them to hide rhe ugly SS armor.  
---
But if I pick one I’d say the stalkers coat.  I think that’s what it’s called.
---
I have the same problem, I think it may be that covert is active and sometimes it processes but most of the time doesn't. I find that when I am the first player down the shaft the first few head shots hit around 650-800, then as more players show up it drops.
---
Shame you can’t shoot them with the Vox Syringer and understand what there saying.
---
I'm on PS4 though and don't really play with people much.
---
Hacked weapons that have magic attributes or people wielding hacked weapons wearing magic armors make them hacked+magic weapons. They literally evaporate everything
---
Oh yea forgot about that.
---
I just learned you can get it in the whitesprimg bunker
---
I was REALLY looking forward to earning ATOM POINTS again. Another 100 levels of poorly implemented seasonal tat, that will be untested and bug out until patch 23. 
---
What we really need is a "FFS Bethesda!" emote.
---
Bring back atom points for Challenges.
---
Don't have to play with someone for them to get access to your acocunt.
---
Better question, why the fuck are you announcing it?
---
Not in 76. You'll be fine.
---
TLDR; at the beginning so you don't have to click. Sorry.
---
i wish someone would give me free 15000 atoms.. sadly im not that lucky
---
I guess I feel like each day that I'm maxed not buying something is a day lost.
---
If they want people to keep playing these events then hopefully they won’t add it for sale for a really long time. Otherwise whats the point of all the hard work it takes to reach max level if i can just buy the items with gold shortly after the event ends. Add the fireplace as an event item later on but not this soon after the event ended.
---
Was he in caution and u danger so your not getting the sneak bonus
---
Yeah I mean we all know how slow ammo converting is so you just end up just dropping or selling hoping a player will grab it up. A slider would be great because I’m not stuck with a remaining 2 missiles because I need one more just to convert it.
---
Umm. To hopefully get an answer? Is this a known bug. Last thing I bought was the wood grain camera paint. I also completed a bunch of score levels in PA, maybe they stacked the 150 atoms for each level?
---
Most games don't let me make a fat beardy red head. When they don't, I make a female character. My FO76 main is a fat beady red head. Altho, I do wish some of the outfits weren't just for a single sex. I'd kinda prefer a slightly more masculine version of the Order of Mysteries garb since my chest seems to glitch out wearing it.
---
Also, ever since characters being able to actually wear changing outfits/armor has been a thing (I'm a rapidly approaching older, gamer) I've made females just to play cute dress up. Everyone should feel cute sometimes. -shrug-
---
For real, their never getting a dime from me after this poor performance. I'm iffy af about buying anymore of their titles as well. Their more interested in Skyrim ports. I load trucks, I don't yeet boxes or step on them. Feels like a bunch of chucklefucks at Bethesda would break a finger just looking at a box.
---
Isn't it Ally to get the Gauss Shotgun and Gauss Minigun for the Settlers and Raiders respectively?
---
I did the same.  Didn’t feel like respecting my main so I started a new one, then another and another.  
---
Actually helps keep the game a little fresh as little as that is by now.  Lol.  
---
Got 5 toons all in the 200+ lvl and all different builds.
---
I just buy one thing a day till the sale .
---
Indoor bases have higher budgets.  Start planning!
---
It's wild for sure. I'll probably use them to boost through the score board. I'm just about to the camp item lmao.
---
Just don't use those few legendary perks. It's quite simple. I don't understand why people always need something to complain about.
---
They're already talking, the mask just muffles it substantially.
---
1. The female model looks better.  I mean, have you seen the filthy underwear on the male model?
---
2. There aren't enough games with female protagonists, so I'm going to make my own.
---
Yeah there is a lot of information missing here.
---
I didn’t get it at launch either and waited until it was $20 from the recent sale. This was definitely $20 well spent despite all the criticism we give it sometimes
---
it's not a problem now that the spawns have been fixed. Before fasnacht things weren't spawning properly like bloatflies. I spent 4 hours trying to get a single gland and in that time i only found something like 7 flies.
---
Makes sense. I use the grocers myself, just thought people were still going for high capacity, refrigerated, etc
---
how the hell you are not downvoted , every suggestion about existing weapons makes people angry for some reason.
---
I get that, I just thought it would be cool
---
Wait really 
---
oh fuck, what have I done
---
Well 400 with a sneak bonus would be 1200 so we’re in the ballpark.
---
Didn't realize that, thanks! Into the grinder they go 🥳
---
If there's one thing I agree with you its that the forums will be flooded with people complaining about the damage reduction. Followed by the I'm quiting and cancelling fo1 posts.
---
Also, also.. the surgical mask and bandana's never fit my fat face. Damn you clipping!!!
---
Hey there, have you opened a support ticket regarding this yet?
---
Light machine gun, it's a machine gun.  Machine guns are heavy weapons.
---
It's definitely not a known bug, and if it were me I wouldn't want it to be.
---
Also is his mate critting and he’s not
---
If I had known I genuinly wouldnt have sold all those stimpaks
---
This type of post is bringing me joy and wonder. Thank you
---
I rarely if ever get badges from those dailies anyway...
---
The terminal that’s on it
---
That seems weird. Oh well prepare for whine fest next week
---
We have a promise with no reason other than naieveté to believe it will be kept.
---
Weapons: Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
Dev Note: The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.

Having a hard time taking this in faith, given 16x the detail has yet to happen and this "temporary" adjustment hasn't been tweaked in over a year. I'm sorry if it feels like I'm directing anger to you, but I'm not. I'm just saying with this kind of track record we shouldn't take the claim at face value.
---
You can complete in the last week by doing 5 minutes a day (or less.)
---
You chose to spend hours a day to finish weeks early.
---
As usual the one with the FL is the one that F the L.
---
Fuck enjoyment, how do people still sell this shit on ebay when they just make it?
---
That is like selling fresh air that is delivered via text message in a perfectly biodegradable package...
---
That's a good point, all the objects that I brought up were physical things to put down because that's how they brought it. I'd be perfectly fine with just put in a spawn Circle down and then it has to be on the ground as well.
---
The silliness of not having anything there and the spawn point being completely random it's just not. Right now the only way I can get people to spawn where I want them to at my camp, out front is to completely tear it down, build it back up and hope that it randomly spawn them out front this time.
---
I'm going to delete this very soon so tell your friends and buy everything
---
Yeah maybe. Although practically, it does feel weird to me to hang a boardgame on a wall as a decoration.
---
but u can move those 3 points to luck and add 3ranks of bloody mess for more of a damage boost.  ur bloodied and use unyielding gear.  ur not going to miss those 3 points under intelligence.
---
My time to shine!
---
I recently spent an afternoon charting the efficiency of crafting each ammo type to convert into AmmoPoints vs. the amount of materials needed. Next, I spent a couple of days on different farming runs to see how quickly and easy it is to craft the most efficient ammo types. I also accumulated 100,000 AmmoPoints during this time.
---
**The most efficient** ammo to craft and convert into points are **Cryo Cells**. For 2 Crystal, 5 Lead, and 10 Steel you get 25 rounds of ammunition — without using Ammosmith — for 80 AmmoPoints. This, however, comes with a bit of a catch. Steel and Lead are two of the most common crafting materials in the game, but the best sources of Crystal come from mining. This requires the use of Extractor Power Armor — which all players in the end-game should have access to — and a good amount of Acid for smelting.
---
Sidebar: During this experiment I found it quite easy to maintain Acid levels by creature farming. There are a number of locations with reliable spawns of enemies who drop Acid and it's faster to kill and loot them than look around for junk. Fans of A Colossal Problem should also note Wendigo Teeth, which are dropped by every Wendigo Spawn you kill, give you Acid.
---
**The easiest** ammo to craft and convert are **2mm electromagnetic cartridges**. For 5 Lead and 15 Steel you get 15 rounds for 70 points.
---
Crafting 2mm EC might be faster and more streamlined, but unless you're tight on time or lack the necessary resources, it's **absolutely worth it to farm Cryo Cells** instead. For fewer pieces of Steel, plus a bit of Crystal, you get 10 more points each time you craft and 10 more rounds of ammunition. Why does the extra ammo matter? Because once you factor in Ammosmith and Super Duper this number increases exponentially. When you're crafting thousands of rounds of ammo at a time, the extra bullets add up quickly.
---
**BUT WAIT, YOU CAN ALSO GET FREE AMMOPOINTS!**
---
Yes, that's right. It's not as fast, but if you have max reputation with the Raiders you can purchase the ArmCo ammo machine for gold bullion. The most efficient ammo to create and convert into points, by far, is 5.56 ammo. The machine will churn out 200 rounds every hour in-game which you can exchange for 500 points.
---
Plus, you know, any ammo you pick up or receive as a reward from any quest you complete can be fed into the Ammo Converter as well.
---
EDIT: Here's a good resource for farming locations: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
EDIT 2: Maybe should note this experiment was done with obtaining Fuel in mind. It's probably the most difficult ammo to craft outside of explosives. In almost any other case, straight up crafting the bullets you want is the best option.
---
&gt;Q: DO FALLOUT 1ST MEMBERS RECEIVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS?
---
&gt;A: We may add extra Fallout 1st bonus rewards in the future, but want to focus on getting Seasons in the game first and seeing your thoughts.

I'm sorry, but how the hell have they not gotten a clue after an entire season has already gone by?

Seasons *are* already in the game.

Not really interested in any of it, but hey, free shit.  I'll take it.
---
They are probably going to charge atoms for the other lol
---
You say that now, but the next Fallout just might be in....
---
CANADA!!!
---
You have to have beat Wastelanders (Secrets Revealed quest). Then gold bullion as a currency opens up to you.
---
Radiation isn't what actually causes the mutations.
---
F.E.V. (Forced Evolutionary Virus) actually caused the mutations, the radiation just triggers them to become active.  And we learn in one of the earlier fallouts that F.E.V. was released into the population before the bombs fell (a couple of years iirc).
---
In FO76 we learn that Arktos Pharma was doing experiments on people in the months leading up to the war after putting "chemicals" in the water supply.  It caused them to become super mutants and snallygasters.
---
AMS was experimenting with Ultracite and was getting the mutations we see in animals, like the molerats and giant insects.  But they didn't know what caused it as it wasn't always related to the massive amounts of radiation from the Ultracite.
---
It stands to reason that the Player Character, being a native of the area prior to the war, was exposed to the F.E.V. alongside most of America.  So when we experience radiation, it can trigger the muations we've already aquired to actually express.
---
The Mole Miners are just a variant of Mutated Human that adapted to underground life in the mines. Remember, the F.E.V. isn't entirely random, it selects mutations that are beneficial and surpresses mutations that are harmful (generally speaking).  The goal was to cause humans and other animals to evolve into a "higher" form, the plan just went off the rails since that's not really how evolution works.
---
yeah I'm on ps4 and I would appreciate it
---
ps4
---
I see this posted frequently and while I would *love* for it to happen, it's obviously not going to be realistic within the current game:
---
- Sliders don't work within FO computers, which means the converter would need to become a vendor.
---
- If it becomes a vendor, then they would need to create a new currency for it. Adding an entire new currency to the game for a SCORE reward already seems unrealistic. The game gets around this issue for "lesser" rewards by making physical/digital tokens like the theme park tokens, but those are dealt with via computer screens again.
---
- Even if they made a currency, that currency would then need to be adjusted so that 1 bullet bucks (TM) = 1 bullet for the cheapest ammunition.
---
- Every ammo would then have to be re-valued because you can't have anything be worth anything other than an integer of bullet bucks. This also makes balancing the system a*lot* harder.
---
I just don't see that stuff happening for an ammo converter. I think they'd sooner add ammo breakdown capabilities to the Tinkerer workbench (like NV's ammo workbench).
---
I’m not sure if this is head canon or supported by terminal entries, but I came to the conclusion that Mole Miners were mostly striking workers who were affected by some combination of HalluciGen Gas and radiation. I seem to recall that there are terminals at Poseidon Energy Plant that say that the HalluciGen Gas used on strikers caused them to frenzy...?  
---
In the Uranium Fever event, whenever a Legendary Mole Miner spawns, the computer refers to them as a terminated manager. These are clearly ex-mine employees.
---
OP is asking about the 20% weapon weight reduction from armor not the legendary effect on the weapon. I guess I was downvoted because people assumed I meant the 90% reduced weight effect which does not reduce the mod weight either
---
Bethesda needs to make a mole miner expansion and put a city under Ash Heap. Make it accessible from tunnels in the various mines around there.
---
Ive seen many sales never once was modules on sale. But I can hope as well.
---
Am I the only one flipping out over the train set at 50?  I didn't know I needed it until I saw it.
---
I run bloodied build too. First thing is when you've not been noticed wendigos won't spawn. So unless you've come there for screws sneak is your friend. And I don't have to tell you how well sneak works for bloodied build.
---
In the tunnel to the left to arena entrance there are no hazards to suffer from. And Earl cannot enter that tunnel.
---
So from there you can just perform sneak attacks on the poor guy, this works like a charm.
---
They should add the Tunnelers as an enemy of the Mole Miners. The Purveyor and her associate know they can't beat them alone and are trying to gain the trust of the vault dwellers to help defeat them.
---
It isn't stated anywhere, but I just assumed mole miner suits use a similar technology to what's found in ghost people suits in the Sierra Madre. It's just the mole miners are still fully alive and in various states of merging with the suits/going insane.
---
I stopped claiming the consumables after the first week to avoid weight. Looks like I need to clear about 2-3 hours this weekend to click claim on each with that ridiculous lag on the game board. I'm sure I'll accidentally go over max on at least one between scrip, gold and caps.
---
I'd like to see it added as something people get *every* 50 levels, not just once.
---
Bud, you brought the science. Thanks for this
---
It's looking good! I got rid of my bobblestand myself, due to the limited budget for my camp... (grr), but I do sell them all now and people seem to appreciate it.
---
good work, the collection is complete!
---
Shut up
---
In NV it was a seperate system with its own perks and resources, but ive made the suggestion before to allow us to break down ammo into the components they are crafted from but a handful of people didn't like it because you couldn't get resources for making say arrows by scrapping .38 ammo. I like the idea of scrapping ammo but I doubt they would implement it.
---
Every other game I've ever played (which is far far too many) makes everyone start from 0 when they add this sort of "alternate advancement" system.
---
I find it funny that when this patch hits, everyone level 50 and over will suddenly just get more powerful for nothing.
---
And people are complaining.
---
Bethesda just showers people with free stuff.  And the community whines and whines and whines.
---
There's a lesson there.
---
psn vdub580, let me know next time you're on and I'll load up a server.
---
On at least one of my characters, once I get that I will be scrapping my entire CAMP and rebuilding with full BOS theme construction.
---
*Enter cave
---
*Shoot boss till it's dead
---
*Avoid collapsing cave bits.
---
It’s in a mine. High level, instanced event. Bring in your best gear to the fight. Big boss and bunch of mobs.
---
Keep buying atoms so the server keeps running and I think plushies of everything is inevitable.
---
good to hear, good direction, but I swapped stats much more than that + card lost due to legendary cards, I think it should be 100
---
When you say instanced, does that mean it's just for the team you are working with? Or can any random person join the event with you and fight the Wendigo?
---
Not yet! It’ll be in the atom shop tomorrow in the free section
---
Is that cobra commander?
---
There is no such thing as a "magic attribute" and "magic armor" is just for one single weapon.
---
Don't go redefining the terms used in this game.
---
What's next? Will you be accusing every player that can one-shot a mob as a hacker and keep on posting your rants here?
---
So does that mean stalagmites fall from the ceiling? What happens if they hit you. Do they do damage or do they stun you temporarily?
---
Fix the damned respawn bug. It's happening to me every time i die.
---
No plus 100lvl reward
---
Till you start trying to figure out how your stash is at 799 lbs. Then you see 200 40mm grenades 15 missiles and 200 railway spikes. Or is this just me?
---
Mostly yes, you might want to have ammo perk on some other character to craft ammo.
---
I just hate that I'm kind of sympathetic to it this time. I refuse to participate in it when it happens, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm going to agree with it. I don't like that.
---
What do you mean by this? Isn't budget budget?
---
You just reminded me of concept art that exists of Fo76 where the player was intended to be able to become a Super Mutant, a Ghoul, and even a strange Molerat-Human hybrid... maybe you're onto something here..
---
Spend it.......
---
LOL I hope they get removed ASAP.
---
I just got this to work on a public server. First I placed the fuse next I used the terminal then when I loaded the blood I kept pressing on the centrifuge and it worked after a few goes then I used the booth
---
I guess not, is that the end when we break into the vault and get the 1000 gold and you can share it or keep it for yourself ? Because I know of it but I haven’t finished it. 
---
So I guess I’ll get on it so I can get me some treasury notes :) thanks Player
---
Uhhh....just went up to 25400. Wtf is going on.
---
Lol yeah i really like some of the early rewards though. The 76 level BoS reward is cool but i won't cry without it. This last season I really REALLY wanted the Captain cosmos armor and jetpack. I also wanted the fireplace door. I'm glad i can be a little bit more chill about season 2.
---
So is this Red viper handmade skin different than the tropical camo Handmade skin?
---
Awesome, thanks Malo :)
---
Yep, it's the end. Go do that then Wastelanders dailies and most public events will give then. And no problem Ruby :)
---
Shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. When events are over, they are over. SOP for the game.
---
Yeah WHAT?????
---
That's a week earlier than i originally expected. Awesome to hear!
---
My intention is to use the dirt tiles and the greenhouse!  Seems like the most obvious thing to 'clean up' my CAMP's farm.
---
The tropical camo skin isn’t even listed on the rewards anymore on their website so idk
---
Here we go again.....
---
I have a great name for my female character: Jenny Talia 🤣🤣🤣
---
Oh, a part of the game that the developers are devoting time to? A part of the game that I already paid for? A game that should be fun and interesting? Oh. I should just be quiet because you think everything would be fine if no one complained about anything? 
---
Yeah, fuck that. The legendary perks SUCK and the community created a much better and more interesting set, but Betheada ignored them.
---
It's so frustrating as a ~~female~~ gamer, to see another gamer thinking that this game reflects in any minuscule way the out of game reality.
---
Spoken like a true member of the Brotherhood of Steal lol.
---
I completed the entire 1st season over a week ago just by doing all the daily/weekly quests.  I didn't grind out any by doing the repeatable 10k XP reward either.    
---
And I never spent a dime on it.
---
This is why I wear a dress. Just let it all flow.
---
battle pass?
---
What is you talking about? Hacked weapons with junkies prefixes work as hacked+magic weapons. You do realize armor with certain effect boost weapon damage?
---
You must have never played doom 2.
---
Hey, totally agree different strokes for different folks. My end end game is not more than thrift shopping for rolls I dont have at bargain basement prices. Love the thrill of finding something crazy for caps in a machine. Work is pretty high stress these days and I find it super relaxing.
---
Yes they do damage, and also stuff will be on the floor, if you see something glowing on the ground move away.
---
Ahahaha. Fuck no.
---
When it tells you to “Escape the Mine” after the boss is defeated, don’t.  You can take your time and loot the enemies. Not escaping the mine has zero consequences.
---
I consider any argument that boils totally down to I just want a bigger camp as a bad argument. Any limit is an arbitrary limit and no matter how much room you give people to build their camps, a vast amount of players will complain that they want bigger camps and camp size will continue to inflate.
---
The seasons is basically a battle-pass system.
---
Is it not obvious?
---
Figure out how it happened?
---
That could be an okay point I suppose but still I feel like a lot of people leave the match after everyone deploys and only about 40 players stay in
---
If you need anymore help just ask :)
---
trickle that shit down yo
---
It'll be interesting to see how many people actually leave and if it results in any changes due to lost revenue. I've come to terms with it already. If I find it unplayable I'll just stop playing. I'm not threatening anything, nor complaining, just saying I'll be fine regardless. We need balance in this game. I just hope this iteration doesn't break it completely.
---
Spend harder....
---
Xbox and Pacific us
---
Same problem, already allies with the settlers but daily missions for the crater seem to take forever
---
Lol! Your response is epic!
---
Tellingly, from that wording, they clearly still expect everyone to be on every single day if they want to finish the event.  The worst kind of Fortnite-style FOMO being instilled.
---
What 15000 atoms?😉
---
&gt;chinese igloo
---
Great description
---
The way I like to think of them is that they are actually just a different kind of human, just with a much more different “shape”. As you have said they talk, carry tools, wear cloths, and even craft their own weapons. 
---
My theory is that Mole Miners are humans who’ve been trapped in the mines but eventually escaped. But because the landscape was still suffering from an apocalypse, they continued living in the cave. They crafted their own suits and used those to be able to scavenge for food and supplies. But because the suits where very makeshift in design, they still took in radiation, causing them to mutate into a type of ghoul and fusing there masks onto them. Since they are ghouls, they don’t need to eat or sleep anymore but because of the degradation to their masks, they need to replace parts or else they will suffocate. They also have mentally degraded into something in between a feral ghoul, a human, and a scorched but still retain enough of there past to be able to do most of the thing you described them doing. This explains why they are so hostile: because they want to find parts you may be holding as a desperate act to repair there degrading masks. 
---
As for Mumbles? She can be explained as simply retaining a better sense of humanity or even her memories after the mutations. She scavenges and crafts legendaries for players in exchange for scrip BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO START AN ARMS RACE AND EVENTUALLY A WAR AGAINST THE HUMANS BY AMASSING AN ARMY OF MOLE MINERS. In all seriousness idk why she sells legendaries or has scrip machines set up. Maybe she wants to be a trader of sorts and this is her hobby?
---
I got pretty much all mine too except Christmas but I feel like it's the only way to pvp these days where no one will cry about me being unfair because I have legacy weaps
---
You probably know this, but JIC: the available caps are individualized.  You personally can only sell 1400 caps worth of goods to NPC vendors per day, but that has no effect on other players.  They still have the same daily pool available.
---
It's all part of game balance vs. economy.  Those caps are pulled out of thin air, just like caps found on corpses on in the world.  They limit the maximum number of caps you can make from NPC vendor sales per day in order to keep from flooding the market and devaluing the cap.  It only works so-so, even with cap sinks like fast travel fees, event lotteries (Christmas gift wrap and empty pails) and bullion purchases from Smiley in place.  That's why you can't even buy some god roll legendaries for caps, and why they had to put in a hard 30k cap limit.
---
Dude... ew...
---
Heh, yeah I know my quote is the end of a Beastie boys skit from their  To the 5 Boroughs  album I think.
---
Send a support ticket, and don't go hog-wild on spending them.
---
no
---
8 person instance. Don’t have to be in a team. Once 8 are in a new instance starts. I’m a bloodied commando build and did it with a level 12 and level 18 yesterday. Put asbestos lining on your chest piece to stop damage from the ceiling. Sneak and kill. Magic weapons help but I just use a B2525 fixer primed and can take it down relatively quickly
---
I'm sure they'll be atom shop at some point.
---
15,000 I was able to buy all the PA paints and most camp stuff. Still have 1975.
---
Complete quests for the settlers and raiders up until the siding part then choose one to do the vault quest with after that  you start to get the notes for any event with an ! and the daily quests for wren, rocksy at the crater
---
Ward for foundation and Davenport at the overseer's house.
---
The new arrivals quest leads to all of this
---
Please explain how this is done??
---
I agree that it's not a lot, but you also don't want to give up a ton of the grind if your bethesda, right? We've seen a million times over now that they're looking for ways to increase how much time you'll spend in game. I think this is actually a nice gesture that they're listening, it's genuinely helpful since it gets you 1 additional rank 2 perk, and also doesn't undercut their goal severely.
---
I would have liked more, but this is a fair compromise.
---
Take one for the team, follow through and then probably specials will likely be my main. I'll have to see on the ammo one and maybe swap it in from time to time.
---
I'll be more focused on my others as they won't be able to swap as much
---
I'll see if I can find more answers.
---
Also, you probably know this but, gaining xp in quick succession will merge the xp gains into one popup.
---
The goddam grass man. If the SBQ spawn dropped as much ammo and screws it'd be shit because the fucked out terrain of the Bog ensures you lose every bit of loot and legendary. 
---
I love the SBQ fight- can't stand the location. Mow the grass robots of Watoga you ain't got anything else to fuckin do.
---
Why would it seem weird. The event ends. Why would u be able to claim rewards after the event ends?
---
I'm sure bad coding. You saw my first post right? You can't get banned for bad coding so I recommend buying everything while you have it
---
You don't get the ONE THING I want until [level 99](https://media.tumblr.com/c67eb92adddde16c70a4d4ae2a901d2f/tumblr_inline_mhpijvfUXx1qz4rgp.gif)...
---
That sounds good, I respect again just last night but it really had to be done. Glad I can get some perk coins back.
---
Wait, 15th? That's only 1 week break between seasons. What happened?
---
Their primary use from what I've gathered is for the weapons plans you buy with gold bullion as they require legendary mods to craft them
---
Sorry I may have accidentally bumped the reply to someone's post
---
All I said was don't use those few legendary perks. You're getting really worked up over Beth 'ignoring' requested changes to their game. Some of those ideas are, indeed, awesome, but we don't work for BGS, so they're just pipedreams. Sorry, man.
---
Also, I never told you to be quiet. Speak your mind, bro.
---
You're not wrong, but the way they were going about it was pretty contrived too. It would have been fine if they invented a new type of experience or resource, but what they decided to do instead was create a system that punished people who had previously changed their points.
---
We never asked for that system, it was foisted upon us, so the people that used it a lot were rightfully upset that they were punished for using a system as intended.
---
I have the same problem, two xbox's one house. One xbox no problem, the other I have to log in on a profile that works- start the game and get to the title screen then press Y to change player then select my profile.
---
Does creature include Wendigo Colossus plushie?
---
Agree with all of this but you forgot the most important:
---
* Nerf or remove the gauss shotgun
---
Yup, exactly what im gonna do. Dont wanna get banned for a weird glitch.
---
No bugs in this game
---
Fridge and high capacity for me (high cap is a swap to fast travel)
---
I used armored or lead lined a ton before SS armor
---
Sounds good bud, ill be on a bit later tonight, gotta take the dogs for a run.
---
Thanks for organizing the fun, be great to get a strong team together.
---
I done okay with pa and heavy guns too but yeah explosive or commando is best
---
But you guys do have a point.
---
Only on shotguns I believe
---
I can't tell if you are sarcastic right now or not
---
thank you
---
Yeah its not my problem so I dont give a flying fuck. /s
---
Yeah id also look into whatever card you have on file make sure you ain’t getting charged out the ass lol
---
I had heard about the cap limit but I did think that the vendors had individual caps and that it was all in the same pool like the legendary scrip machines
---
hmmm
---
Just did. Saw a post about going back in to the shop and it doubling again.
---
Apologies but i dont see where it says this? If true that is a little concerning seeing how i think most people will not finish the legendary run. Maybe im wrong though
---
I guess its cool they are doing this but WHY!?  
---
Just tie points to levels. Simple as that.
---
No charges just keeps multiplying i have 400k now
---
Right? I have a B25 laser rifle and it breaks after 4 reloads. They should also buff its damage. Unless you’re use a legacy, the laser rifle is still one of the weakest weapons in game.
---
Nice, I didn't know i needed nuke cards in the season rewards till right now haha. Those will come in handy.
---
The mothman plushie will move around your camp when you're not looking.
---
I lost 200 perk coins to level swapping and lost cards, to be honest I thought it'd be more. That's over 564 levels, and I've opened every pack immediately and swapped special more than needed. The players who've had the patience to keep packs will find 50 probably closer to what they're missing than they thought.
---
Don't let your atoms get too high. I'm in the thousand dollar range but 100k real money worth of atoms may grab attention
---
It’s pretty obvious.
---
Holy shit balls I’m afraid to get on and check mine now lmao, but I did actually just see someone with the same issue of atoms doubling ironically
---
That’s one of the many problems with modern day fallout
---
Seriously, what kind of masochist would want to report this. They did nothing wrong to get the atoms.
---
You’re it the only one. I felt the same way my friend. But, I kept going at it. The Grind. And once you finally hit ally? It’s worth it man.
---
The hell is battle-pass and tiers? Fallout 76 has seasons and season ranks.
---
Also only show the ammo you can convert or show your current ammo total on the ammo sell/buy screen
---
And most hacked weapons work as shotguns cause beam splitters
---
Sorry mate, but you are ranting with only half the knowledge required to understand what a hacked weapon is and how and what makes a weapon magic. 
---
While there certainly are hacked magical weapons around, they are on quite a different level than the magic Instigating, Junkies, Medic, or Stalker with a FR of over 150. OR FR with 3 certain secondary attributes.
---
As for the armor, that is just one attribute that makes any shotty magic (Besides the armor is not really needed if you get a shotty with the right attribute combo).
---
Anyways, judging by your post history, you like to rant, so carry on. I'm out.
---
What was the first post? I want to take advantage of some bad coding too lol.
---
Apologies, very sarcastic.  Ward can’t sit in a chair right.  The game is wonderfully complex, and bugs are common....sometimes irreproducible.
---
Some of us have too much plans, I have like 50 sitting till someone buys them. I'd rather give them to my friends or if I get sick of it just drop them at a random players C.A.M.P
---
Haha that's a fun thing to do too, except now all the rolls I need a character bound and I can't ever buy or trade for them. I just need 2 more SS armor pieces and a plasma caster. But I still like finding cool bits to give friends or my own alts.
---
Even if they kept the set amounts but made it more specific array like 1000x, 500x, 100x, 10x, 1x for each ammo type.
---
Their payment system has something going on with it. I purchased atoms of another account and I’m not getting them. Others are reporting they’re getting loads of atoms on their accounts that didn’t purchase anything.
---
My belief: Their servers are fucked up and it’s giving players who aren’t connected to purchases atoms instead of the purchasing player.
---
This is the second thread on here about it and the 4-5th from their official forums.
---
Cant wait to buy the lunch boxes with the gold bullion I dont have because the wendigo cave wendigo is fucked even though I do several encryptids, acps and sbqs a day.
---
&gt; It’s good for getting scorched beasts to land if you’re a melee build, I use them all the time on my melee character.
---
Really? I never knew this.
---
They won't, they're already dirt cheap in spite of making the best armor in the game.
---
Fix the fast travel bug.
---
As I understand it, the return for investment is so bad not even lower levels benefit from this. It’s designed to clean out the dupers’ scrapboxes. Can confirm it hasn’t cleared out mine! Donated 250 plastic and only once when I found out what bullshit we get.
---
Plans bought with gold bullions (not including power armor) make a random legendary versions of the item when you craft them and require legendary modules to make. So it's just a crafting material for the new gear.
---
Try conversing ammo while in power armour, you cannot see shit
---
no more bloodied
---
Lmao
---
Add Argonians in enclave gear.
---
Bam
---
Government lizard people confirmed
---
Source of iguana bits
---
cool I probably can't get on until 7-8 pm eastern time.
---
It could just be made rarer and legendary so that it has limited ammunition
---
I think it favors her but she didn't think so and I gave it a unisex name so I could change it later and not play a male named Alicia
---
Have same issue going on right now, dont even know how many atoms since the numbers are going off the screen. Not spending anything until this is sorted out.
---
Increase scrip, bullion, 1400 cap daily limit.
---
You shoulda been here for the triple exp weekend, ship was nuts!
---
Im sure I gained 100+ lvls easily that weekend.
---
Nuked whitesprings used to be an easy 5-10 lvls per launch too.
---
Even meat week was gaining me a couple lvls a night at lvl 200+.
---
People who ground the SCORE exp challenge crushed tons of lvls too to get the rewards early / one their own schedule.
---
Lvl 1000 is strange to see, but completely in the realm of legit play if you had some time/quarantine to kill.
---
Does this reset current progress on the chapters?
---
So it's not glitched? Just takes a lot of rep to see the bar move?
---
Yeah, no one was around.
---
Fix the fast travel bugs and remove limits on caps, scrip, sales to NPC vendors, an gold bullion.
---
You are the definition of an Anti-fun soy redditor. 
---
I dont care if I go into negative karma for saying this.
---
Because you have until the last second of the season to earn score. Imagine you complete a challenge in the Knick of time and then the season ends but the board disappears and you can’t even claim the thing...
---
It would make sense for them to give a little time after to claim rewards.
---
Make handmade drums hold 80 rounds
---
Very weird
---
i was ready to smash my controller and then someone said to check the blood bags at huntersville. found 7 in 2 mins.
---
I wish I could donate the scrip, bullion, and health/rad kits. I'm maxed on scrip, have no interest in the bullion grind, and have more stims and rad stuff than I will ever use.
---
How about just sticking to cosmetics and camp items? 
---
Also, not looking forward to the grind to get things that actually interest me. I've not logged on since I finished S1 because of total burnout.
---
Edit: corrected an autocorrect error
---
Please for the love of Atom don't forget to make one a romancable ally.
---
Am i lying though?
---
It could still raise flags with their account. It's best not to risk it.
---
You don't need no fr if your weapon's a shotgun or has splitter on or has explosive as secondary effect cause that let you hit double times and it ends up hitting many more times than a weapon with 150 fire rate would. Just walk away if you have no idea bro. And about the armor... it works with weapons other than just shotguns.
---
In fact this post was inspired by me going to my stash and wondering, "what the sweet fuck is going on?"  
---
Then realizing I had like 100 some odd 40mm and 15 mini nukes
---
Glass walls, railings, and stairs should be available as an Atom Shop bundle.
---
Claim it all now, they go away on the 8th ~~and the next Purveyor sale is after season two starts anyway.~~
---
Nothing fun about GG EZ mode
---
*sigh* Someday, I'll have a clean toilet to go with my sink.
---
1000 rounds in a gatling laser is possible with the power user perk.
---
Yes you are. Use a stalkers pipe pistol for a challenge. I like killing the queen in under 3 minutes. Playing this game and trying to speed run bosses with the boys has been some of the best fun I've ever had in a game. People like you want to take that away so you can larp and pretend you're an epic style survivor in the wastes.
---
That was not a suggestion
---
Basically
---
Yes you lose them if you don’t claim them by September 8th I think they said it inside the vault today. Why are so many ppl not claiming the rewards. This is the 5th post in a hour about this
---
Before the event is over.
---
you have to claim them before the event is over.
---
Ah, thanks I was a bit unsure about that one. Thank you for clarifying.
---
Y
---
100 levels, but only 4 things I find interesting. One of which is level 99. This is gonna be a grind...
---
Has Nuclear Winter been abandoned? Other than the occasional limited time rewards, there’s nothing new since the last time I’ve played the mode 6 months ago.
---
Project Paradise is my favourite event in the game.
---
I'm so surprised nobody does it. It has a guaranteed level 100 3* boss at the end and 99% of the time 3-4 legendaries during the event also. Its a great place to farm legendaries and the enemies are all a high level so it's good for xp grinding also.
---
I'm just glad I can do it solo so it's not to big an issue that nobody turns up.
---
It’s not even basically, it’s a fucking battle pass. The only ones arguing it are pedantic assholes that are trying to avoid the moniker, “battle pass” because they have some sort of pent up preteen angst against Fortnite.
---
Well, that's annoying. Thanks for that
---
So untrue
---
And the handmade skin that looks like the blood eagle one
---
When will these legendary perks become live? For console?
---
Enclave general outfit with deep mining helmey from a colossal problem looks desial punk,, I indaa rocketeer or gi joe character.
---
No where. Just my own speculation...seeing a caps reward of 2500 so early in the board when it was in the 90's in Season 1 made me question if they are either increasing the amount of SCORE needed or going off from Level 100 from Season 1.
---
No problem. Thank you!
---
XP grind is too much for me to want to play NW.
---
I’ve had this happen multiply times. Like I have my fixer and my combat on and one sometimes will get taken off without me doing it. Other times the spot I put a gun will change to a totally different one sometimes
---
I could’ve sworn I read something (in game) about them being humans who were trapped in poorly manufactured mining suits.
---
not sure how, but you're welcome.
---
The hacked weapons doesn’t have free will to kill stuff instantly. It’s the a-holes who uses them this way. 
---
Hacked weapons are work of art and I doubt they can remove them. If you see someone using one, report then.
---
I have the gold bullion Secret Service Underamor and the Atom Shop special. Let me appy the latter as a skin to the former!
---
Filed a ticket too, waiting to hear back. Im not wven relogging its literally just going up on its own
---
Not everyone can commit as much time to the game as they’d like. Knowing they can still purchase some rewards with earned bullion, which is still a grind, or with atoms, then why not? You want to favour people who’s only advantage is more time. There’s not even any skill involved. Bit stink, mate.
---
Oh my god! An exterminators 33% vats hit chance 1 agility 50 cal! This is the most useful thing I have ever gotten!
---
Pm me
---
Change the engine of the damn games
---
Cause they nerfed mag capacity on handmades and its annoying. Drums used to hold 80 i believe.
---
Platform?
---
Some events seem super rare. 
---
I hardly ever see campfire takes any longer. But path to enlightenment and feed the people come up ALL the time.
---
Sometimes I wish it would go back to how it was before. So at least I can activate project paradise/free range etc myself.
---
Xbox.
---
Wow
---
If reporting worked, I wouldn't bother coming up with a post
---
Next purveyor sale is Sept 10-14. So no it’s not after Season 2 starts. It’s right after season 1 ends. which pisses me off because Bethesda is purposefully not letting us take full advantage of the extra scrip during the sale
---
Because freedom
---
More melee that nothing.
---
While i'm fine with some camp plans being exclusive i don't understand the logic of putting essentially a building set at the end and making it available later. It just devalues the end of the season.
---
Assassins abetting a buff? Really how much?
---
Its happening to me. If i go into my atom shop it literally doubles my atoms.
---
Wish they would get rid of the NW daily S.C.O.R.E quests.
---
Umm... does it? I read the thing twice &amp; unless I missed it it says nothing about losing season 1 rewards if they're not claimed. Hence the question
---
I’ve got a bunch of gold bullion but I’m not actively trying to get secret service gear x x
---
If you've missed out on fewer than 25 cards from losing duplicates in card packs and/or moved fewer than 25 SPECIAL points, this is a good deal.
---
If you've missed out on more than 25 cards from losing duplicates in card packs and/or moved more than 25 SPECIAL points, this is a bad deal.
---
**Show of hands, for whom is this a good/bad deal?**
---
For me it's a good deal because I planned my build from the get go and didn't need to move a single SPECIAL point, and also I stopped opening perk card packs once I completed my build.
---
Those were unintended?
---
I am glad I got mine when I did. The antler chandelier suits my camp so well.
---
This
---
u/Valseek
---
Nah it's their mess up, he didn't ask for it or do anything to make it happen. They don't know he even asked about it online. Any reasonable person gifted hundreds of atoms for no reason would/should take full advantage no questions asked
---
see I'd love to see a colony of calm mole miners each with a unique look like the purveyor would really add layers to the game
---
Congrats! You fixed everything that anyone has ever bitched about on this sub. What will this sub be like then? You have ruined us.
---
That explains why when I PVPd the dude with the Tesla rifle that my frames went from 100 to 5....
---
Hmm
---
Well someone posted something earlier where it says make sure to claim all rewards before season 2 so I’m taking it as you will lose them. But hey you never know maybe you wont. But I didn’t risk it and I claimed everything
---
So I should move my dysentery-melons from my camp lake?
---
I played NW during the legendary run to get Score points, but I haven't since I reached 100.
---
Probably a lot of other people did the same. 2 weeks ago the queue was like 5 seconds.
---
I have beer steins sitting on my pool table.
---
Kill big wendigo, shoot him in the bum bum for bonus points
---
Well count on it they have recycled or added to the atom shop every limited event item damn near or offered a clean/recolor.
---
yo why u dissin Terry?!?
---
Season 2 starts on Sept 15 and the Purveyor sale is Sept 10-14. Where does it say they clear the board before season 2 starts?
---
So, you've got what. 2 bosses that take all of 2-3 mins to kill? (assuming earle is the same)
---
What about the other 99% of enemies that get murdered instantly?
---
How about YOU use a stalkers pipe pistol for a challenge. see how your speed run goes then. Surely that'll be fun AMIRITE?
---
Obviously you need to get your hands on a legacy Gatling plasma. They are all sorts of op fun when your not turning yourself into a goo pile.
---
I've been usuing my bloodied melee, with all the buffs you can use and adrenalin maxed im hitting him for over 6k on his head with my DCG. Usually about 8 swipes and he regens, then I kinda just clear mobs for a minute and let everyone get their hits. Running solo i can kill him in under 1 1/2 minutes from entering the room.
---
This is different. This is taking money out of Bethesda's pockets. Expect this one to be resolved quickly.
---
Explosives is on par with commando and that’s why the high levels complain about it. Waaaaaa I actually have competition,  no fair must be removed, nerfed! Waaaaaaaaa!
---
Lucky
---
I think it’s more an issue for people who are finishing up on the 8th before it ends. There is a chance someone completes it but can’t get into the board in time. Doesn’t make sense.
---
As long as I dont get banned.
---
I'd send the atom store into total fucking overdrive. Every item perma-listed with rolling discounts across the older shit, then introduce a line of faction based crafting table and other furniture packs (actually all of them- BoS, Enclave, Pioneer Scouts and those fucking downtrodden ones who get nothing worthwhile supplied). This would be backed up with gun skins in classic colors like black, chrome etc.
---
Then move into worthwhile outfits. Real talk, Beth nobody wants any more fucking mascot outfits. They're cheap, nasty, and after the first one aren't funny anymore. 
---
The undoubted income generated I'd then feed back into fixing the game up, actually lovingly restoring it rather than throwing out the next buggy bauble on top of the last one.
---
Well if we go by what Bethesda said this is just phase 1 of the balance changes.
---
[What the hell is Goofy?](https://youtu.be/PA-mYIDJ2Hw)
---
Same feeling on Mole Miners.
---
3 star enemies drop three star loot every damn time. If that means less three star enemy spawns fine.
---
Yeah right bud, im literally just on the map menu watching the numbers go up. I have it on video.
---
Yup. Then you go from 800 lbs down to 598.
---
oh and get rid of legacies because why not
---
You used to but that stopped along time ago
---
And with a 50% discount!!! 😱😱😱
---
So it's not actually been confirmed then?
---
See I think of the mole miners like the workers in the FNV DLC Dead Money, they’re innocent workers who are now forever trapped inside their suits.
---
I disagree.  I think it adds plenty of flavor, and reminds me of Fallout: New Vegas' Hardcore mode.
---
Hope so. Some people already made more than a million atoms. These people are literally asking to get banned but they seem quite confident cause Bethesda didn't ban abusers the last time
---
If they play, it’s not enough
---
Honestly workshops are the only PVP option for players. Prerelease this game was heavily advertised as a PVP game. Once you've completed the quest lines there's not much interesting to do, besides embracing the grind.
---
I personally enjoy going griefer hunting when I'm  bored. Occasionally I'll contest a workshop if the owners lvl 60 or more to see if the owners looking to PVP as well. 
---
There is a little warning that pops up before you claim a workshop warning you about PVP. Outside of workshops pacifist mode protects you from PVP. Aside from the explosive bait exploit and AI encounters I would say Appalachia is pretty safe for a post nuclear wasteland.
---
Bethesda has made many changes to reduce griefing. They have made little to no changes to cater to those of us who want to PVP. 
---
I don't support griefing, but if you find enemy AI encounters difficult you should stay away from workshops. Aside from fusion core farming they are worthless. You can obtain way more scrap looting elsewhere.
---
How many times has it been...stuck?
---
i've always thought they were child miners who mutated once the bombs drop.
---
I'm sure its a coincidence but I totally feel the same way, except reversed. Sided with the raiders and I can'm bt for the life of me get the settlers rep up, ironically seems like the side you worked with give you more rep but again that's doubtful lol Also seems like the "neighborly" level might just be a slog it just feels like it eats up time and points.
---
Don't forget to visit "Ohio River Adventures" and take pictures for the raiders during the photo opportunity daily if you have it available! They're not worth a ton, but every little bit helps!
---
What do you mean by "magic"?
---
I hope you dont, especially cause its not really for your fault, I'd say keep the atoms for now and don't spend them, that way they can't say you capitalised on it, give it a month or so and I'd say you're probably safe (or at least safer) to use them, enjoy it but don't go atom crazy cause that might set off a red flag or something u fyou have like 100k atoms in the space of a night for example
---
Just advice from a community manager.
---
Why would i. Im content with using my op stuff that i worked for months to get. Youre the soyboy whos yelling "WAAAH UNFAIR" and throwing a tantrum so now everyone else isn't allowed to have fun because "durr too OP ples nerf. I can't get my stalkers shovel because he hitteded that legendary before me."
---
 Its a game man.. not supposed to be a grind fest. You should Go find some friends and try it yourself :)
---
Check the posts from earlier there is a post about it. If they say make sure to claim before season ends don’t you think that means you would lose them? What else would that mean?
---
The ranger outfit, Fashionable raider hat and Mothman glasses!
---
see I'd love it to move to a buff system or even a healing and recovery system more then a have to system
---
the legendary perk survival shortcut though basically nulls need of food water disease cures though
---
Yes that would be good also i would like it if they added alien blaster rounds as there so hard to get
---
They should have just given us a backpack skin that go with red viper skin as a legendary run reward. Instead, we are given armor ace backpack that don't go with anything. Very poor decision making by Bethesda
---
My bad. [But here's a forum post where they're saying to claim your rewards before the 8th.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/426653/the-legendary-run-ends-september-8th?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en) 
---
If you really wanted to argue semantics, they're not *explicitly* saying that you won't be able to claim rewards after the 8th, but that's just being intentionally obtuse. No reason not to claim them now.
---
I've had things move to a different spot on the wheel before, nothing's disappeared for me though.
---
&gt; Can you make a viable bloody build without investing strength?
---
With pistols or rifle, but not heavy gun/shotgun/melee.
---
Congratulations! Now you just realized that they don’t care.
---
People like this have:   
---
- multiple accounts.  
---
- multiple fo1 subscriptions.  
---
- keep the game alive for you.
---
It will still have issues, its bethesda we are talking about, it doesnt matter which engine they use, even if they changed engine they would have probably done the same thing, like when fo76 released, unfinished and unpolished, i dont give a flying fuck about bugs i just want a stable smooth framerate on console and the current frankenstein of an engine that bethesda uses today inst going to give me a stable framerate.
---
Not having trouble farming them. I am fed up of farming phones and a bot that just collected them for me would be mint.
---
I think it’s in floor decorations. It’s either that or misc. I learned that On my second event. You need 5 spoiled meat to do it tho
---
Please, tell us what the technical difference is.
---
It seems like this change has a lot of stability improvements (e.g. shotguns no longer being awful on free aim compared to VATS). I think what will happen is damage and enemy resistance tweaks after this goes live. I just hope they don't take too long.
---
Even though I'm a stealth Rifleman, I'm supportive of it overall.
---
And if *does* just become a permanent nerf and increase ammo consumption by an obnoxious amount, then I guess I'll stop playing.
---
They haven't done anything for performance since launch really, it's in some ways worse with the tesla tiled lighting issues.  I can send you some tweaked .ini files that make the game uglier but smooth if you want, I run on a 670MX @30-60fps.
---
The lusty argonian enclave officer
---
Exactly! Now I’m stuck trying to figure out what goes best with it

Not that hard to get.

Albeit a lesson that ignores all the other stuff people are whining and whining about.
---
Wah wah wah....
---
These are pretty lame tbh
---
Which post? I've not seen it (regular on this sub) and it's not in today's hot list.
---
Not saying it's not here but would like an official confirmation of some sort.
---
what platform?
---
I will search for it. I don’t do hot list I do new posts. Let me find it and I will let you see it
---
Pretty sure it's a placeholder icon. One of the ranks for 12 nukashine has one of the ghillie rifle skins as the icon.
---
Fisto finally met his match.
---
Yes! I’m trying to farm violet flux and fusion cores to prime my Gatling laser and nuking the SBQ is very, very helpful!
---
If you have any vampire weapons it will allow you to take lots of damage while you fight Earle since each shot at him or the wendigos heals you. You’ll do less damage than with a bloodied weapon but it’s worth it for the survivability. I switch between a vampire’s 50 cal and vampire’s minigun.
---
Share the plans with both sides. You will then stsrt to build each factions raid team. Each member has a side quest to do so all in all you have like another 3 quests in each faction till you reach point of no return.
---
Damn that army floor/base at lvl 39 is really nice !!!
---
You're not looking great in this thread, either :-/
---
It's just a placeholder on the website... On PTS it looks like this:

I have had this happen
---
When does this go live? I want cheaper ammo crafting, lol.
---
Edit, do you also get a coin-per-level-after-50 backpay?
---
Thanks all. That’s lame that it won’t be available in the gap week. Oh well.
---
Beer is a medicine
---
3 of my 4 characters have very little mistakes on perk choices. And all have at least 5 plus packs unopened each.
---
I like all but ratty skirt.....actually I like that one too.
---
I hope that cool jetpack isn't a power armor one like the last one was... I was super excited about that, earned it, then realized it was only for power armors... felt burnt even though I didn't read it right.
---
Red or tattered if you have a dinner in the evening
---
Can I just get a donate all?
---
They aren’t bringing Vertibirds...they walked.
---
One of my female characters is named Pretty Pink Princess. And it’s the one I play when my daughter wants to hang out with me. Because she likes the game and the building aspect of it, and she thinks it’s cool to go visit Biv. We keep her camp updated with all the fun stuff, including the ***Teddy Bear Shop***, where there are multiple Thanksgiving Displays, each filled with six identical bears. All of the variants are represented, and there is a vending machine at the exit with all the extra bears available for sale at about 5c each, IIRC.
---
The other one is named Natalia. She is an homage to Natalia Dubrovhsky from Fallout 1. And I built her in a very similar manner; Stealth Sniper focused with some ability in one-handed melee if needed (blades, mostly). I even made her character model as close as I could. 
---
Ideally, I wish we had the option to have character names displayed of just gamertags.
---
and fallout 4 was built in the same engine as skyrim, so it's basically just skyrim right?
---
come on man, try harder.
---
All of this.
---
I agree that it’s an overall improvement, but holy crap do sniper rifles, bows and revolvers suck on the PTS.
---
Maybe there will be a Fixer-esque BoS recon rifle or anti materiel rifle to buy with bullion with Fractured Steel, but as of right now single shot weapons are god awful on the PTS.
---
Yeah, id like to try those ini's
---
They are building a helipad at the ATLAS base. They can build them with the supplies we gave them
---
Not in the game yet, they discussed recently about adding inside, instanced bases, which would allow for more budget.
---
I think they could be  Dwemer from Morrowind. When Kagrenac used tools on the Heart, and dwemer seemingly dissapeared from existence, they actually moved from TES universe to our (Fallout) universe. And ofcourse, they did not expect radiation and mutations to occur, so they transformed over time, probably even before the war, from all ultracite mining with nukes and uranium liquefaction methods used by Blackwater mine. They lost most higher senses and reverted back into primal forms.
---
Force of habit. I always play female characters in Fallout because of the opposite sex speech and combat bonuses (most NPCs being male), and I made my 76 character before I found out those perks don't exist in this game.
---
Out of cork?
---
Yea I get you my side pistol build is pretty much done for. I guess we'll have to see how this unfolds over time.
---
10mm submachine gun and Submachine gun stopped by to say not all machine guns are heavy.
---
i have everything i need to be bloodied (and if i was missing something i'd be able to trade for it) I choose not to. 
---
Bloodied is the demon hunter of fallout 76
---
100% on board with this idea. Since it's the only remaining, functioning vehicle, would add so much more to the game...
---
fix fast travel bug, make dead legendary enemies glow, remove all explosive energy guns, change stealth boys so that they stop working when player takes damage, fix vats, remove frog legs and gauss shotgun from nuclear winter, make a new nuclear winter map based in watoga, cancel one wasteland for all, add player usable vertibirds, increase daily limits for scrip to 200 and caps to 2000, increase player cap max to 50k, remove all presents from the game, increase stash limit to 1000 lbs., add in power armor stations that display power armor, remove all daily SCORE challenges and replace with more weekly challenges, cancel the damage nerf, change bloodied to max out at 50% bonus damage on weapons (adrenal reaction and all that still work), change mutants effect to scale to 5% per mutation with a 25% max, nocturnal effect would not cause you to lose damage/armor during daylight, all troubleshooters/mutant slayer/zealots/ghoul slayer/exterminators weapons would give 50% bonus damage to specific enemy type, assassins armor/weapons work against human enemies/npc's,  allow team pvp at workshops even if team is public, increase resources collection rates at workshops, remove ammo factory machines from all camps, allow people to use a new legendary module (100 scrip each) to put random legendary effects on all crafted weapons/armor, increase pipe pistol/rifle clip size, make special bonuses for full sets of matching armor, add a power armor arm mod to reduce ap/fusion core cost for vats, boost damage for missile launchers and fatmans, add a parachute mod for armor torsos, add a central trading location that has terminals that link to all player vendors on the server, add more horde style events with waves of enemies (perhaps defend crater/foundation events), there is so much that could be done to improve the game.
---
The entire dev cycle
---
How does one solo an event where you need to protect 3 creatures that move around? I've always been curious about that.
---
It’s their payment servers. No one is duplicating shit. I made a comment on the last post that people purchasing atoms right now are not receiving them and players not even associated with the accounts that purchased them are receiving the atoms on their accounts. There’s several posts on the official forums about it and it’s affecting all platforms.
---
If I could find those turrets that just randomly disappeared I could probably get enough budget back. I'm probably gonna move my camp soon and rebuild.
---
They're SMGs.  Not full machine guns.  Of course they aren't heavy weapons, they're meant to be fired from the shoulder.
---
For the most part, I can handle everything that comes my way. I guess I should look into other things.
---
I feel it'd become the ultimate griefing tool. Every douche and his douche mates circling peoples camps throwing bait and shit.
---
Hard, hard no from me.
---
I see people with these weapons everywhere. It makes me want one  lol.
---
Doctor Zasio says Hoarding is wrong.
---
Could someone share with me how long does it take to rank 100? I really want the hellfire pa skin
---
depends, on male characteres all dresses are beautiful.
---
I posted it. In the official forums there was a notice about the end of season on and how smh unclaimed rewards should be claimed before the end.

Build, I use whatever fits my interest. I know not a good way to run things, honestly I get frustrated chosing a build. Weapon wise, I had a 10 mm anti amor machine gun as back up and instigating mini gun.
---
Leaving the engine out of it, 76 is basically a huge Fallout 4 mod. Multiplayer was in development at the same time 4 was being made. It was intended to ship with 4 but was cut before release. Look, I want to see a real Fallout single player very badly, but with everything else Bethesda has going on, including the new tv show, I just don’t see it happening.

That one wass a godsend.

Try Organ Trail. The zombie-redux.
---
I hope you’re not getting charged each time...
---
Lucky. Well, lucky IF what they say is true and they can’t directly change our atoms...
---
Honestly would be totally fine with a clean version, I’ll take any over the NW variant. I personally just am not a fan of the colors on that one
---
I can't see it being too hard to have this follow the same mechanics with Pacifist, essentially still player weaponry so same slap damage should apply. Just doing it from higher up.
---
Dude I wear the exact same thing but with a red bandana which looks badass with the medical helmet.
---
Witch costume dress does it for me.
---
The whole survival aspect of the game was never fleshed out much cause I think most players never really cared about or wanted it (outside of a toggle-able mode maybe) so they are just scrapping it basically
---
I have a level 45 one
---
Wait, really? I'm still getting my bearings for late game, but what I'm hearing is I can take the speed demon, Carnivore, and herbivore mutations just sort of across the board now. Is that right?
---
Edit; Oh Carnivore and herbivore lock each other out. But it sounds like I can just pick carnivore and if I'm not killing stuff I can eat... not care?
---
I dunno, if I shoot you in the head with a lever action you won’t survive that with the rifleman perk.
---
This just happened to me! I have hundreds of dollars of atoms now..
---
Cushioned landing pad? Or instead of pneumatic tyres, cork filled?
---
Canceled 1st and removed my cards just to be sure.
---
Well their recent change was good move, 500~ levels is far better long term target for legendary perks than previous 834~
---
I'd imagine just like with nearly everything else, if you run pacifist it wouldn't harm you. And they're not exactly quiet, so you'd hear them coming.
---
I can agree to the seasons thing but Fallout 1st I think would be a little unfair. At least with seasons you’d potentially have to work for it.
---
I was hoping for a break of two or more weeks between seasons.
---
I dont have fallout 1st. Sorry. I totally forgot the difference between the two. Edited to say stash.
---
Checks bank statement -$24,000

Hell yeah

There was a LOT of steel, too.

Yo leaky can I play NW with you and my buddy tonight.
---
The ammo converter interface is now even worse than before they “fixed” it and I wish everyone would continue making a huge deal about it until they have to acknowledge
---
Well said!
---
Remove the currency limits, fix the VATS issues, fix the fast travel bug, and redo the ammo converter with the vendor interface.
---
Heck, I’ll just fix everything while I’m at it.
---
On one hand this is good for players who respecced and thus lost coins unknowingly.  On the other it means that players who did NOT respec have an advantage worth roughly 14 levels of progression and also it means that it seems we are 100% locked into perk coins as a mechanic.
---
A lot of people, myself included feel perk coins are a trash way to progress legendary perks because the process of scrapping perks is boring to the point of being highly annoying and it's super easy to accidentally scrap a necessary perk.  Never mind it takes a looooong time to scrap enough perks to rank a slot all the way up and this must be done over and over.
---
And here I am, went from around 6K atoms to 0. I was hoping it was a visual glitch but now I dunno lol...
---
lol.   
---
!Remindme 10 years
---
with an IP that generates as much money as fallout does - we are going to see another title before 2030.  The industry and expectations are very different from what they were between NV and 4.
---
A lot of this would be absolutely fantastic!
---
If I had any camp space.
---
Then play a different build. I much prefer playing that way, as it took a lot of effort to get to that point with all the best gear.
---
Remove ionised meat from the game, make it so you always get one stabilising item (glowing mass/hardened mass/high-rad fluids) from any enemy you kill in a nuke zone.
---
Maybe not the most important issue the game has, but it's on my mind right now because of some frustration while wandering in nuke zones this evening and getting lots of ionised meat but very few stabilising items.
---
I'm actually a big fan of the Tank Helmet. Feel like it'll fit my scabby raider scavenger character a ton, in the way that it would look completely out of taste with the rest of his outfit, just the way a scabby raider should look.
---
I'm not surprised one bit, ever since they've done the morgantown map they've totally neglected the game mode, if they want people to enjoy a game mode you got to have it run well and have new incentives to play, new maps rewards ect and not wait long as fuck to get I to a match I wouldn't be surprised if they remove nuclear winter like they did with survival. Even the screen says nuclear winter is "beta" just like survival was for a long time lmao bethesda's trash

Its so stupid how they do xp there anyways you don't have an incentive to kill players you can sit in a bush and just not die and get more xp
---
I built a bar outside Morgantown and needed a bartender. Welcome to The Tipsy Mothman!
---
Dude, they're epic. You can change your build completely with those added SPECIAL perks, it's insane
---
I guess I have a problem 😂
---
Ok thanks
---
It’s what happens when you first log in and it says “Rank 1/1” on the menu screen. Make sure you always click on the Legendary Run Menu before completing any challenges, or it’ll do this. You may have to re-equip your character icon each time this happens as well.
---
Yeah party boy/girl is crazy strong
---
LMG stopped by to say you can be a heavy machine gun and be fired from the shoulder.
---
I should've specified - I mean like all the cue balls. Just looks unlike a pool table to me without them somewhere, whereas the foosball table looks filled up at least.
---
Need a perk coin event happen periodically
---
I imagine there's no way to accurately track the lost cards, so this is probably the best solution we can hope for. At least it's something...*shrug*
---
I haven't tried it but was wondering if the flamethrower trap trick would work here. First build the tree, then destroy it with flamethrower, build the floor and repair the tree?
---
blocker, fireproof, dodgy, serendipity should be perks ur using.  firepoof u can go without depending what mod u have on ur chest armor.
---
and with that im canceling my fallout 1st and moving on to different games.
---
Thanks for the tag and for the reports! We're actively investigating this issue.
---
Hi all and thanks for the reports, we're actively investigating this.
---
And you didnt wait for better items? Dude
---
I certainly agree.

Damn bug fix list is too long :D
---
Thank you for the link, I hadn't seen anything that talked about it. I would only want to wait to claim the scrip for the sale but you're right, it really does look like rewards need to be claimed before then. Dang
---
A free Legendary Perk rank up for a level 50 player. Sounds nice
---
Thanks I hope you guys can help!
---
Hey thanks for the report, there's an issue here that seems to be affecting a small number of accounts. We're actively investigating this.

---
Wait perk coins??
---
Here I am waiting for my 128 atoms to change. Also, how did I end up with that weird number?!
---
I got into a lobby where a guy was giving out free hacked weapons. I took a couple of them (who wouldn’t) but later sold them all because they ruined my experience with the game.
---
Brother, I don't think you understand the power of the gauss shotgun. It's like a combination of a long range rifle and a rapid fire grenade launcher. It's more valuable than a briefcase with 5 codes. If it's made rare, it better be made rare enough so that there's never move than one in a game.
---
It'd be nice to add smaller stash boxes, like toolboxes and safes with a smaller limit. I never understood the reason for having them besides looks. Itd be nice to see them besides just another link to your stash box
---
Outdoor bases are part of the applachia world. So when you load the game up it has to register the base and every part of it and that taxes the game. They made a budget so that the servers wouldn't hemorrhage loading in all the camps. With indoor bases it is an instanced area. So when you load the world up it will only need to register the entrance and won't register the instanced interior. The interior will only be registered when you load into it thus the loading screen. The overseers house, interior foundation, interior crater, deep something, and wayward are instanced interiors too thus loading screens when you go in. By making camps instanced it means we can have a larger budget since it won't be as taxing. Though it could be because of other factors I'm not a game dev so this is just what i know from basic game design stuff.
---
Difference?
---
Would you call your Mercedes a BMW if you ever had one? They are basicly the same, you know.. cars.
---
Or if you go buy a bottle of coke, do you ask for a sprite? Cause you know, they are both sodas.
---
You are talking about two completely different products.
---
So, no melee adjustments? If this goes live, they kill melee. So sad. I love to play my melee Char.
---
and also make deathclaws scary again. they are too weak.
---
They are chunky and less scary Ghost People
---
&gt; Also back in the early 1900s miners were paid with mine script. Basically, the coal mines owned you and your family. So you would use script to pay for housing (which was owned by the mine company) or grocery stores (also owned by the mine company). Maybe this is why the purveyor wants paid in scrip.
---
Could you imagine that?  Shoveling sixteen tons of coal in a day, only to get paid in company store credits?  You'd end up owing your soul to them.
---
If you enjoy server crashes every 5 mins, sure, y not.
---
This season has some cool items. Liking it better than season 1 item wise.
---
That would definitely help with organizing it might be harder for them to do. I remember in the old fallout I would have chest for different things like weapons food armor and stuff I would use all the time.
---
A battle pass... is something you purchase. There is no pass...
---
that actually makes really good sense. ty
---
Or you can jump into the room.  Strange this place has no map marker.
---
I get this when I have similar weapons equipped, for example BE handmade and a BFFR handmade, one will get unequipped on logging in.
---
that would be pretty cool to be able to play as another humanoid.
---
Gehenna looks like a slim grafton monster and the Molech looks like a snallygaster.
---
Cue “Ride of the Valkyries”
---
I'm sure they will but it'll probably be with an enclave centric dlc.
---
Red dress for sure!
---
Except no one is able to throw grenades cause you have someone flying and two gunners while the passenger is along for the ride. Maybe the option to swap positions on the bird but no free movement like grenades
---
Wait there isn’t a release date for this is there??
---
Free stuff isn't worth much when it's delayed a year, isn't exciting, introduces a new grind that is impossible to complete without cheating, and actually rewards cheaters the most.
---
Not only are most of the so-called "legendary" perks lackluster, so far the single dumbest thing I've witnessed in game design is present, the requirement to have all your armor matching.
---
It's neat that the legendary perk system might eventually actually be a thing (maybe we wait another year), but you have to have incredibly low standards to think it's well done as is.
---
Ok knock your bitter self out
---
It’s only two spoiled meat and it’s under floor decorations!
---
I think either the witch robe or the purple sequin dress are probably the best.
---
Give us all a one-off 15000 atoms present, much easier!
---
The possum scout dress is kind of cute... in a schoolmarm sort of way. Also, the Science Scribe uniform has a really good waistline and is sort of a dress... you just have to ignore the weird neck thing.
---
Same mate it really helps keep the game fresh my favorite builds are my junkies bow and my heavy berserker what about yours
---
When does this go live?
---
What 10000 atoms?😉
---
This is fantastic. Thanks Bethesda!
---
Thank you for sharing this. You have made my fallout experience significantly better now.
---
It was 5 for me I had 5 spoiled for radstag. Unless I was completely out of my mind. But I don’t have the perk for less building resources
---
How about you don't. This seems like compensation for the score bug and 20$ for a reskin.
---
Why would you grind? I got all the season 1 items with no grinding whatsoever. Just logged in did my daily every day and weeklies on Tuesday and logged off.
---
couple times its been chat or audio messeges and sometimes its people I follow on Twitter. It's just an interesting subject to me.
---
More 1.6 Mil. Now
---
Because i said broke game they don't like that here. Even though its an objective fact.
---
Thanks. It was the last thing I needed to claim from the board.
---
Elite Ranger Armor with Firebreather helmet/Medical Goggles + Gas Mask, or the Flyboy Suit with Responder backpack and Armored Raider Skull Gas Mask.  If not in a helmet, the 2076 glasses always are a favorite
---
Hope you can actively investigate weekly challenges auto complete issue as well. So many times it happened, and you offer no compensation through your support.
---
But i guess your atom shop is more important than customer service.
---
Bethesda is auto-complerting a goal and compensating for it.  How novel.
---
Good to know. Have this free award so other people can see it and so it doesn’t go to waste!
---
Jug down.
---
They done got old rando ma
---
Some of the best features in the game are the result of unintentional glitches.
---
Ranks 76 and 99 are the ones I care about.
---
Why comment twice? shut up you whiny ass nerd
---
It's a bad deal for most anyone over level 200 already unless they swapped few specials.  One wasteland's xp buffs theoretically make it a good deal for anyone close to level 100.  Really sucks for my level 385 main that has swapped specials constantly.
---
That’s totally it...I had the contractor perk equipped at the time!
---
I donated nothing, I also earned it!
---
No. Baseless speculation but seeing as we have a brotherhood dlc coming out (2 actually) I assume we'd get one. 
---
We got raider and settler items with wastelanders so themed items go with dlc's I'm assuming. 
---
Think of all the other stuff we got. We got Meh and Eugenie's outfits well before wastelanders, probably because of the huge delay in it. 
---
It just all depends if they come up with an enclave dlc.
---
The lever action is my go to, id gladly fork over the atoms to see my baby sparkle.
---
Until you know why it’s there I would not spend any atoms or at least not spend past you balance previous to this because like banks if it isn’t supposed to be there and you spend it, you get charged for it to pay X amount back
---
Technology Papers that we can hand in for that repeatable.
---
I was going to say. I swear I wasn’t out of it. I always forget to put perk on while building.
---
I wouldn't be complaining about something like this
---
Exactly! Don't see too many people use it but won't be dropping it any time soon
---
Never crafted grenades yet the game says I’ve crafted all 76 for the Atoms. Same with Beckley and Sludge Lung.
---
Golf outfit with tactical marine helmet or
---
Plague doctor mask, slacks and suspenders and derby hat
---
Does the Garb of Mysteries count as dress? That's my favorite by far
---
No I haven’t. I spend like 700 to see if it would go down to just under 1000 like 950. But it stayed at 15,900.
---
How about a nice ivory grip?
---
Did you dupped your atoms?
---
Yeah an enclave dlc would be great.
---
There's a 10% tax built in to every transaction
---
10% vendor tax
---
10% tax
---
Taxes
---
I just don’t want to be charged or whatever later. Idk... seemed weird
---
The game takes 10% of the price
---
It’s a tax
---
Yes! With chrome on the metal
---
Mostly it doesn't.  I was just curious as to why guys do this? Im well aware women do this as well, but there are more guy gamers than women. So when I meet another female character I always hope it's another fellow female. Just a little sad when it's not.
---
I suppose just another Bethesda glitch to roll with hah
---
Yeah Todd the taxman. So What I do is I add 10% tax to my transaction. Sucks but consumer has to pay just like in real life. So at the end of the day, it doesn't work and should be removed.
---
Screenshots?
---
No. I just logged on..
---
Just thought they should add the Lincoln Repeater skin from Fallout 3
---
How do I post them?
---
Y’all are forgetting a *huge* piece of evidence.
---
In the Uranium Fever event, when the legendary Mole Miners spawn, what does the announcer say?
---
“Terminated management personnel detected on the premises.”
---
This means a few things:
---
a.) they *were* at some point human
---
b.) we can likely assume the unique environment of the mines/the Ash Heap caused their unique... mutation? Idk
---
c.) very possible they are some form of ghoul or are similarly ageless, or at least have very extended lifespans (granted it’s only been 26 years, so maybe not on this one)
---
This. It's extremely tempting to go crazy and buy a lot of things but can end up biting you in the ass.
---
Med goggles, gas mask, insurgent outfit. Or Firebreather Helmet and Western Duster
---
&gt;I think it adds plenty of flavor
---
I see what you did there ;)
---
Sep 15 for everyone, my friend.
---
Purple sequin dress????👁👄👁
---
Gotcha. Thx
---
I love the tattered version!!
---
This is a mood😂
---
These rewards are awful. The only thing that’s cool is the greenhouse set
---
No one's asking you to donate a flake of *your* skin.
---
Just a flake of a mole rat or maybe even yao guai for the daring.
---
Unless you have leathery skin, perhaps from years of poor health habits or sun exposure....
---
Then yes, they want your skin.
---
Pick one or more.
---
1. flat storage increase, say 1000lbs?
---
2. keep it as is, and have a 500lb storage that can be accessed across characters.
---
3. make stashboxes that have the weight reduction perks, or if your character has those they apply to stash
---
4. make ammo/Misc unlimited like the junk is for 1st, only ammo is unlimited for ALL
---
I love the science scribe too!
---
I guess it is more grey than purple. For some reason it looks like a light shade of purple to me
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sequin_dress_(Fallout_76)
---
Yes.  I mistyped.
---
I imagine they're going to touch on every faction in the future in the form of a raid or difficult dungeon of some sorts. 
---
Look at the wendingos and scorched. they got some sick raid content cooking up for the other factions I bet.
---
For super mutants they should bring back the big bombshell that is one that is intellectual... they've already got the floaters for boss minion fodder, can't wait to see how they handle the raid.
---
Aliens have got a huge place in the fallout universe, just play some of the previous games and you'll see, they surprise me every time and can go in any direction with them.
---
The communist presence needs to be touched more as well, they were extremely underwhelming in the wastelanders DLC I wonder if they will invade Appalachia.
---
The Enclave... Sorry but I can't count what we have in 76 as the the enclave.... it's mostly just an attempt at fan service for the older fallout players, could have done so much more with them. I know they will but seriously their presence in 76 is lacking. And no I do not want to see a bunch of assholes in X01 slapped with an enclave sticker on the chest, we want the OG enclave.
---
Deathclaws could use a serious face lift pretty sure they will make a deathclaw themed raid boss in the future, the ones currently in the game if you have marsupial you can just jump over them to not be hit...
---
The Grafton monster.... pretty much in the same situation as the Deathclaw... at earlier levels it's a horrific sight but in reality you could just stand behind a car or something and take 0 damage while you unload all of your ammo into it while it stares at you, same with the deathclaw
---
Robots.... the only difficult enemy in the robots faction is sheepsquach and overly armor piercing mr gutsys.
---
Ghouls I've always kind of seen them as fodder but they can do so much more with them, they need a ranged attack like a spit, easily the most laughable melee mob in the game..... too easy to farm.....
---
Another suggestion would be to lower the ceilings in many dungeons it's currently to easy to cheese with marsupial I love it but it breaks pretty much every mob in the game.
---
Not that Wikipedia is a good source.... but it at least explains why a season is not a battle pass..
---
&gt;	In the video game industry, a battle pass is a type of monetization approach that provides additional content for a game usually through a tiered system, rewarding the player with in-game items for playing the game and completing specific challenges. Inspired by the season pass ticketing system and originating with Dota 2 in 2013, the battle pass model gained more use as an alternative to subscription fees and loot boxes beginning in the late 2010s. **They're never free and usually require annual or seasonal charges.**
---
I'd guess the chances go up every time your atoms get doubled. So...
---
Should probably stop doing that. 
---
And as an extra precaution I'd avoid earning any extra atoms. I imagine some kind of mass roll back to before the glitch went live as a fix.
---
Fix health rubberbanding, fix Vats, double daily currency limit, fix frameratedrops, reduce perk coins needed for leveling legendary perks, add some actual useful legendary perks, every legendary drops the item corresponding to the amount of stars, all bodies are glowing, no more dissappearing corpses, reduce food and water needed, increasy stash, camp budget and make bobbleheads and magazines not affect budget.
---
It looks like the returns are diminishing, but with 4 people sharing it marsupial allows you to jump to a height where you can lose a significant amount of health if you don't have bird bones active. 
---
I find it works really well with bird bones as I can jump and get off 5 shots in the air using my lever because the fall rate is so slow and the height is so high.
---
Unsure of things like scaly skin but I definitely noticed a difference the one time I was in a group and all of us were sharing it.
---
There are a few of us around but it's definitely an end game player build if only for the cost and time involved in getting all the right gear. It's a fun build to run, you have to be so much more aware of your surroundings, always moving constantly to avoid taking any damage. It definitely breathed some life back into the game for me.
---
Dogmeat
---
I really hope we aren't forced to help them out because the Brotherhood are dicks.
---
Not entirely sure, it could be "high tech" junk or maybe they'll give back all the stuff Dorsey had us gather up.
---
He can’t not on this group. He would of have to link us to somewhere that has the screenshots
---
Am I blind or did they remove that camo handmade skin that was there on the pts
---
LOL I posted this exact same thing last night because I had no idea they tax us.  Still can’t figure out why either, the caps go nowhere.
---
Remember how excited people were about how early it was available in the last run? Now hardly anyone even tries to use the damn thing.
---
Can we let them win this time?
---
All of those sounds interesting if I had to pick one it would probably be the 1000lbs just because that seems easy for them the 500lbs storage between characters would probably be my second choice it would make moving things around a lot easier instead of using a private world
---
If legendary modules aren't affected by the sale, then I couldn't care less.
---
OMG IVE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE I NEED IT
---
Yeah I was thinking about doing the same thing.
---
Please. It would save so much time. Frankly, they need to just ditch the terminal entire and just let it function similarly to the scrip machines. I’d happily pay 1 plastic to bundle ammo if that’s how we had to do it for this.
---
I mean... sure, it’s nice, but they put the stupid thing at level 99.
---
Exactly! But also not really cuz you can buy legendary modules from her. Purveyor is a scam artist.
---
This. It seems like the OP could learn a thing or two from you my good sir.
---
Yeah, the more notable gap in time is the great war to 2095, when they were for sure reported. All that shows is that some of them *are* pre-war people or otherwise somehow identifiable.
---
Neat!
---
Bro, can I just have the nuke cards instead?
---
Yea, I am waiting for it to come back to the Atom Store. I remember seeing it like 3 months ago or so but have not seen it since.
---
Yeah fuck lookout the bottom line is in danger! News team assemble!!
---
Meanwhile said atom content remains fucked.
---
Yo Valseek fix my camper while you're trying to not haemorrhage atoms.
---
GOAT
---
Lmfao, somebody’s salty
---
Modules also go on sale?
---
1.6 million atoms? Holy fuck.
---
This just worked for me as well at 2nd try on ps4, all doors were closed and i leave my team so i can do it at solo.
---
Go ahead and nuke, that will only affect new players who haven't gotten the CSS yet.
---
Is that really the crowd you want to hit? If so, you are a scummy dirt bag.
---
Yeah. In the beginning you could just mash the button for whatever ammo. The screens were instant. Now there’s lag on every new screen and the buy and sell is all together. You can’t see what ammo you have. It so terrible.
---
With this game you have to be careful w what you complain about because they will basically punish us for it. 
---
For example, all the assholes who complained about getting more perk coins for the pack perks. WHO CARES ABOUT AN ANIMATION ON THE CARD IT DOESNT EVEN MAKE SENSE. Now it’s going to take way longer to level legendary perks
---
Wow how quirky and unique. Youre not like other players 
---
🤪
---
I seriously wish this actually worked when I had the issue but I'm pretty sure the reason why it doesn't(at least for me), is the fact that the game considers your loot bag as two separate things(death bag vs a drop bag).
---
How is that
---
This is like the third one In a hour. I have game on both systems and have fallout first on Xbox. I have not received free atoms like you guys got and some are saying that ppl that are paying for atoms aren’t getting them and ppl that didn’t pay are getting the ones ppl that paid where supposed to get. I tested it out and bought another atom pack received it right away. So I Don’t know how ppl are having this happen but it’s def weird
---
horny check them, works every time. mic up, yell HORNY ALERT or HORNY CHECK and they will be quiet
---
It felt so good to log in, not look at my daily challenges, and just roam around Appalachia
---
Have you bothered testing it out? I tried twice just \[now\] and it didn't work. I tried it when I had the issue and it didn't work then.
---
The problem is how long over due it is.  And the fact you already had the existing level system.  
---
If they put in a new system (separate from exp) - it would look silly that a level 75 might have max legendries, while a level 800 is weaker due to having none.
---
Yes, I have. I’ve used it multiple times in the past.
---
Granted, I don’t die too often and usually I don’t have any junk on me.
---
Why can’t everyone get the free atoms so we can all ball out together
---
It's called a fair compromise.
---
Yes, let's call any attacks on other players in an online game as griefing or exploits because you don't like it and remove all PVP in the game so Fallout can be some koombya hand holding love world.
---
I don't go out and attack other players or try and ruin their bases, but I also don't care if others do it to me, because it adds more to the game and gives more player to player interactions beyond buying and selling or teaming up to play the exact same events over and over again.
---
I come back and my base is destroyed?
---
Good, gives me something to do and an excuse to use the resources taking up my stash space. Ironically, those who complain about PVP are usually the same people demanding more stash space.... But they'll just fill any extra up anyways and still complain it's not enough..... Because they have no use for all the extra junk but keep hoarding and not managing it.
---
Having destroyed bases gives you a reason to have that extra junk and something else to do other than farming the same events over and over.
---
If players can't attack other bases, then increase the amount of enemies that spawn and attack bases.... See how much more fun that'll be.
---
Is ok, comrade. I take the glorious treasures of the motherland for myself.
---
Hopping in place then tping works for me somehow.
---
Yeah, it’s like free money from the bank: if you don’t report it you’d better not spend it.
---
You mean Meat 6-Days
---
That would be pretty sweet. But i guess it’s something weird going on that only a select few have gotten it to happen. I had someone tell me how they thought it was done and I couldn’t replicate it. So I don’t know. I have 5280 after I bought the 30 some dollar pack last night and another 5 dollar pack just now to test if I would get them. I know if I got them I would prob buy the whole shop out and then bitch as soon as they back charges me 500 dollars
---
It’s a cap sink, it’s not supposed to go anywhere. The idea is to take some caps out of the overall economy. Since caps are infinite, without the tax and caps, then inflation would rise. 
---
Given the state of the economy, we need more and hefty sinks. If there was a reason to blow tons of caps faster than most people could earn them, prices for most things would fall.
---
Now there's a bug that they will fix immediately.
---
Nah just take their food, water and junk from the collectrons to compensate for the caps you wasted for fast travelling for nothing.
---
Compensation.
---
Haha yeah!! I already have a lot of stuff from my prior atoms but it’s still hard to refrain from buying everything
---
I believe the purpose is to remove caps from the in game economy, as an attempt to fight inflation. So it's still 10% less caps in circulation.
---
However, it is now pointless because of the presence of the billions of duped holiday gifts that are still in circulation.
---
On second thought. You have proved me wrong. People will still bitch about something, even when 99% of issues are fixed by an engine change.
---
In the distant past they did, but not in recent purveyor sales.
---
Store the pieces they were sitting on if you can remember where they were. The "missing" turrets will then be located under the "stored" tab too. You can then put everything back hopefully
---
Goodness, don’t remind me - I would always look up lists of all the vendors to see which were easiest to get to
---
I use to only buy some stuff here and there when I would have atoms from challenges or fallout first. But here lately I’m more into buying the camp packs and also outfits. I’ve played since beta but I use to only build a couple walls and stuff for the atom challenges. It wasn’t until lately I’ve taken a more artist approach on my camp. So yeah it would be hard for me. I never once bought a atom pack being we would get them for free. But we are in a new world and I like to hoard everything hahah
---
Right and Right ..  and all the other duping that went on.
---
Try to adjust the world radio volume in the sound settings.
---
That or I have them tuned out, I only hear instruments when im the one actually playing it.
---
Gosh darn it..... happened again! I just repriced everything, did some quests and logged of for 10min. Came back and it all re-set again!
---
So is having a cap on how many caps we can hold part of this? 
---
EDIT: do they also tax us at station vendors etc, or is that just tucked into their normal cost?
---
A whole new season with no new content to play through. Geez i'm going to struggle. I've finished this season and i'm so incredibly bored.
---
^^^
---
im full META now.  junkies/bloodied heavy PA, junkies/bloodied commando, bloodied unarmed. 
---
Id say one of my favorites was a berserker unarmed build.  its was basically a no maintenance farming toon.  stayed in hazmat suit 24/7, wasted no ammo, no armor to repair, so it was a very chill toon to play and then just transfer material to what toon needed it.
---
Then I don't know what to say. If the trick works for you or others, great. I simply provided information based on my experience and testing and like said, it didn't work. Dropping something will move and compile other drop bags so long as it is within about a 5m distance. From my testing, death bags and drop bags seem to not affect eachother in any way.
---
So I tried customer support. They were really nice and said I will receive the game free!
---
Nearly every battle pass has a free version that unlocks extra rewards if you purchase it and you get many if not more comparable rewards on the free version of those passes compared to FO76. Fortnite, Paladins, Rocket League, etc. just because Fallout 76 is basically 3x as long to complete and free compared to any other commercially released Battle Pass doesn’t mean it’s, “free” they’re intentionally prolonging it so users HAVE to purchase levels to have any hope at finishing with semi-casual play. This isn’t even mentioning the fact the rewards from the Fallout Season as horse crap (besides the amazingly menu driven time waster - ammo converter).
---
I contacted customer support. Luckily they are really nice and I will be receiving the game for free!
---
Scrip
---
Either

*make it similar to robot vendors where once you hit spend limit, you can turn in more at a reduced cost to fill your spend bar again
---
*or give the option to convert scrip into something similar to treasury notes
---
* or change it to a weekly limit of xxx 
---
Caps
---
Create a bank
---
*unlimited cap bank account shared between all characters 
---
*keep the 30k cap limit on single characters 
---
*charge a 5% withdrawal fee for any withdrawals from the "bank" 
---
*either make the bank a fixed location in an instance to avoid any possible duping or glitches or give us a camp item like a piggy bank or a safe that we can interact with to deposit or withdraw from. 
---
As an end game player it's ridiculous that I have to create multiple accounts to store caps and left over scrip on just so I can keep playing the game each day.
---
Yes please
---
treasure this moment, get a picture while you still can!
---
and share an image of it for all of us to be in awe of it :)
---
Saint Peter don't you call me, I just can't go
---
The one town that you get the assaultron body from has some. Idr the name offhand
---
Oh I know the power of a gauss shotgun. It's basically a gauss rifle that does more damage. The thing is I've never been killed by it in NW
---
ProTip: Right click the icons of the rewards on the website and click "Open image in new tab" (or equivalent for your browser) to see high res pictures.

---
you could make them
---
if we could place it all willy nilly that'd be cool, it's a great model. but as-is it's kinda lame.
---
But there is no “pass”... so how can you have a “battle pass” if there is no entrance fee lol
---
And I play about an hour a day, skipped a few days and still finished with 3 weeks to spare. You don’t need to spend money to finish the “season” with casual play.
---
Works on all humans now not just players
---
I would love it was a box that you could dump ammo in like the script machines. When you back out it destroys the ammo and it gives you the points to use. Would make the process so much faster. I don’t care if buying remains the same
---
On the roof of the Morgantown Airport Terminal near the crashed vertibird.
---
I play on ps4 and that happen to me everytime!
---
I know I can make them. I'd like to find as many out in the wild as possible, so I don't have to use up all my resources. They take a decent amount of materials to make
---
I have multiple times - I have a pro controller with paddles and two different settings for their functions
---
Summersville?
---
I wish the ranger helmet was less glossy id wear it more
---
Everything is meh at best, Legendary Run was certainly better in my opinion, it just nothing in this upcoming season gets me stoked to own...certainly won't spend atom on skipping spaces.
---
I wanna know who thought nukashine was a good reward. Season 3 looking forward to getting some dirty water and a soggy cram sandwich.
---
Ah! I knew some spawned in the hangers outside, but not on the roof! Thanks!
---
Yeah I think there are a number mines laid around
---
Healing causes the issue for me. I got rid of healing factor but if I eat or pop a stimpak the bug happens until the healing is done. Very rarely I'll get it if I'm in stealth and the game can't decide if I should be detected or not so it pops up the countdown for half a second before canceling the fast travel, running out of enemy range fixes it then though.
---
Could they also took out the ace power armor stand as a reward so my best guess it theyll release them on the store as single items.
---
That’s unfortunate..
---
Then why delete your post, if you’re confident in the advice you provided?  I’m assuming, based on your replies, that was you.
---
Nuka Colas too. There is a lot of shitty fill in this one
---
“An experiment”... aka explosive bait
---
Other things to look for:
---
Mainframe cores for crafting, you get automatically put in your inventory at that stage in the silo
---
Expired bioluminescents from lighthouse event
---
Expired raw flux
---
Gunpowder
---
Useless plans
---
And of course weapons &amp; armor from quest rewards
---
It's a minigame when you notice that weight ain't quite right
---
Could also be fallout 1st related as in the description of the season it says theyre looking into giving more to fallout 1st members.
---
Give it some time...take your time. Clic on the location, wait 1 or 2 secondes...even 3, then press yes for the fast-travel. It often works for me. If it doesn't, i realised that quiting a location and/or going "hidden" fix the issue.
---
When is the purveyor sale?
---
You consider Yao Guai daring? I wouldn't get out of bed unless it's albino deathclaw leather
---
That’s the emote icon, it’s on the reward page, so they are using it
---
Shhhhh, keep em... Buy your way through some of the next season...
---
Healing factor?
---
Exaclty. Im hoping their airship runs outa gas or something.
---
Ive wanted this from day one. 
---
Med kits to hold extra chems and things you dont necessarily need at all times. 
---
A small free scrapbox for all players just to hold like 200 lbs of scrap items. 
---
Maybe a shelf that looks like it has books on it to hold notes and holo tapes. 
---
Limit their sizes to not overwhelm the server and make them only accessable from your own camp.
---
I sided with the settlers, and yes it seemed like it was easier to grind max rep with the settlers than the raiders.  Currently I’m stuck about little over halfway “friendly” with the raiders and it doesn’t seem to move at all....
---
Thats not a good excuse. People are paying monthly to play this shit.
---
I owe my soul to the company store.
---
Yep. Someone wants 210 of it. Why, idk, but they're willing to pay well.
---
No it was wastelanders they added the bow d gause shotgun. But other than that its probably been the same for almost a year now.
---
I'll try that, thanks!
---
I checked and there's a bunch of grenade traps but no mines :(
---
Did you seriously just notice this, it’s been this way since player vending started. 10% goes to Bethesda.....
---
I did the same thing yesterday I was cleaning out my stash just my plans and a couple of weapons but I think I spooked him because I am level 270 and he was like level 7 or something and he took off I left them on a work bench.
---
Todd takes 10% in tribute
---
Yes, the upper value of anything (not acquired by trade) can never be more than 30000, so it puts a hard max on inflation. This basically reduces the possibility of “old money vs “new player”.
---
Imagine if we didn’t have the max, with all the constant caps being added too the economy, after all the duping we had, and from day one to now, we’d have people with hundreds of thousand caps. Weapons and Armor are selling for far more than 30,000 caps.
---
A new player coming in is going to have a rough time catching up. Now players can hit the caps with some work.
---
Greenhouse set was my fave from fo4. Too bad it's at the end of the run.
---
I think it’s hard to speculate based on that. Caps are a relatively useless currency for the most part that comes and goes. Even at that amount it’s nothing more then filler to most players and only a help to new players. Beyond that it’s just a ok thanks thing
---
Considering they only wear simple, undecorated and undifferentiated clothing much like monks of old, yes, it’s possible theirs is an ascetic aesthetic.
---
Morgantown is mostly chosen by the bush pussies because it’s nice and easy to hide. Disincentivise hiding.
---
It will definitely work because Ive had the same issue from time to time. The only problem you might run into depending on how your camp is constructed will be putting pieces back. If you hit those stupid "cant place blah blah" errors then its more of a head ache.
---
Dog tags
---
500
---
Don't do it either way
---
You'd expect some more cool mad-max type shit with Fallout, but instead they sell Light wood Laminate like it's a modern home decor simulator
---
10% taxes. To keep the trains running on time ... oh wait!
---
For the emperor it combined with hunters long coat looks to much like dkok
---
Green or pink laundered really stand out.
---
Take the gold
---
Or? The most Beth could possibly do is remove shop items, it's not like they can charge me for their fuck up. It's almost completely unlike free money from a bank.
---
What’s that?
---
Just make a new post?
---
Just noticed I misspelled aesthetic.
---
Thanks.
---
Wouldn't this piss off whatever faction you're siding with?
---
Minor miners?
---
Gotta remember the effect it’ll have on the fixer and handmade economy though many a folk will get pissy about it.. personally I think it’s a great idea
---
Not really. You loose a tiny bit of rep and some of the NPC's are dicks.
---
If you want to be at max scrip for the purveyor sale that happens in between seasons, then you can use the scrip from the board on top of the max. 🤷‍♀️
---
Welcome to adulthood. Wait till government takes 40% of your monthly income because taxes
---
Makes sense thanks!
---
of course they’re actively investigating their atomic shop and not the multitude of other bugs that actually affect the game lol
---
I personally play a drunken demolitions expert who runs a bar. If you want to grab a cold one and make things explode, I'm your man. He also has as many of the weight reduction perks as possible cause I'm a super hoarder who picks up anything that isn't nailed down.
---
It's definitely a sub-optimal build but I'm having a blast playing it. The closest I am to meta is a full set of unyielding because I need that extra strength to carry stuff.
---
They get over it 😛 The logic for keeping it all for yourself is it’s easier to gain faction rep than gold, so you can make up the lost xp much quicker than you could the gold.
---
or they could have both as a reward
---
Taxes my friend just like what happens to your paycheck
---
How is 76 not cannon? Aren't all the games canon, they're just separate stories told about different areas of America after the bombs, from HUNDREDS of years after the war, to only a doze nor so when the world become first inhabitable again.
---
So that score I'm earning after 100 isn't going to roll over? Aw shucks.
---
I would be happy with an unlimited ammo box.
---
This. And fix the broken ATX items.
---
BUY EVRYTHING
---
My personal obsession with the lore is that fucking fleshy cthulu monster in that basement. I wanted the cultists to be the new spoop lore, but the Mothman is just a big annoying red eye bug and not that scary.
---
That’s true but I couldn’t hold onto scrip at that point being a week before I finished board I had 260 scrip and only another 40 to do until I hit daily limit. I went to purveyor and first roll gave me a bloodied lever action I said man that’s nice then second roll I got my first bloodied fixer ( 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage) I said oh shit. Walked over scripped last gun and walked back over and got a bloodied Tesla. So after that point once I get scrip I use it. But since then which was a month ago, only bloodied weapon I’ve received was a bloodied lmg but no good prefixes. But I can understand if someone would wanna do that
---
It’s not a glitch. It’s a feature
---
This theory must be true,i was doing distant thunder and all the scorched where gathered in one place,i used my bloodied faster laser rifle with a beam splitter to mow them down and it broke almost instantly.
---
It's a placeholder on the website. That's why I said they already have it in thier assets. Why they use it as a placeholder I have no idea but this is what the actual emote looks like on PTS:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/MBcW2JK.png](https://i.imgur.com/MBcW2JK.png)
---
That might by why my friend lost all of his atoms
---
😂 “Never should’ve come here!”
---
Oh wtf?! That’s lame.. thought it would be that image doing something
---
It just works.
---
No, you paid for the base game and nothing more. Anything else is just Bethesda doing what they want without owing you anything you entitled piece of shit
---
Can unlock and use the rewards on pts yet ?
---
The MG 42 wasn't designed to be fired from the shoulder though.  I don't really mean to be pedantic, but there are obvious differences between an MG 42 and a Thompson submachine gun for example.
---
Is this for pc or Xbox
---
Agreed, you can never have too much gold! Right, friend?
---
Same, i used one on the wendigos that earl spawns and it broke after one mag.
---
Nice! I especially like the tire floating in the pool.
---
I'm just saying, unless the game engine experiences a complete overhaul, hacked weapons will always exist.
---
Sell in case automod removes my reply just Google for rose laundered dress and green laundered dress in Google images.
---
I usually alternate gender in single player RPGs, it can result in some interesting characters (it's not too different from reading a book or watching a movie with a female lead.) You can also miss out on some great voice acting if you stick solely to your gender (Mass Effect and Dragon Age 2 come to mind.) I started doing the same thing though in my first MMO, Guild Wars 2 a while back and my girlfriend at the time pointed out it might confuse some people, so I stick to male characters in online stuff (except ME Multiplayer, I'll be damned if I'm going to go without the N7 Fury or Shadow).
---
They've hit us on the snout so many times just for being dogs _ but I reluctantly approach EA Maryland to claim this awkward bit of scrap...
---
That what I was hoping for when this stuff was datamined. Two different icons as two different rewards... but I checked all reward on PTS and looks like we only getting one.
---
lol could you post a pic so I can troll my friends?
---
I mean, according to their dialogue, they're literally trying to mutilate us in a savage and unknown reason for rage and bloodlust. Literally talking about spewing our guts along the floor and gouging our eyes.
---
Filthy and casual.
---
Now we can get double the chance at one of those! Amazing!!
---
I switch persona based off what weapon I'm using, so I guess not a tradition roleplayer that starts level 1 and knows what they're going to use, how to act, etc.
---
Right now I'm a crazy clown with a hatchet (one handed melee bloodied build). I'm thinking of swapping looks just for the ACP fight so I can be a doctor with med perks, but I need the right melee weapon for that - not my hatchet - Idk.
---
This is definitely a step in the right direction.  I'm still not a big fan of the "scrap cards for coins" mechanic, though.  The NW overseer ticket system for duplicates works well for that mode because there is a very limited set of perk cards and it gives you an avenue to get cards you arent getting through RNG and it auto-scraps duplicates.  Having to do manual scrapping for all your cards, trying to figure out what to sacrifice, just seems like a whole lot of work.  Like others have stated, it would be far better if they just tied perk points per level gained.  No card scrapping, no gimping flexibility in builds.  You get X coins per level.  Hell, you've got the challenge system already.  Just make it like NW where every level you get the perk pack, except in adventure mode you get X amount of coins per level and maybe toss in some bonus coins every 5 levels or so.  Reward the challenges retroactively, like you did in NW for the perk packs.  
---
That seems a lot easier, predictable, and user friendly.
---
Yeah both the interlopers. I figured there would be something more about it when wastelanders dropped. But they just added a second one. Also still waiting on aliens.
---
I think I got melted by a level 15 dude with one of those
---
As a level 200+ it was a feelsbad moment lol
---
I thought he was a newbie that just wanted to mess around with pvp to see how it worked, I kinda am still wanting to learn more about how it works outside of NW as well, so Ijust returned fire with my shitty quadpew pew laser pistol I use for tagging stuff 
---
And then I died in legit 1/8th of a second, the dudes gun almost looked like it fired 3 streams of exploding bullets at me at once 
---
I've been melted by the same thing before at a workshop, but I never saw that particular dude 
---
But ya usually I can understand how the PvP works when I fight someone, but whenever I just get fucking melted instantly it's always by what looks like multiple streams of exploding bullets
---
Is that what these guns usually look like when they're firing?
---
Check the Blacklist
---
It’s to curb inflation. Caps are created out of thin air constantly, there needs to be a mechanism to remove them.
---
No vendor taxation without representation!
---
Wait, pneumatic doesn't help against wendigo spawn staggers?
---
I know, I just want to know who some of the most well known are
---
I like to roleplay a survivor. I do whatever "I" might actually do in any given scenario....
---
But the legendary run has killed my groove. Feel like I gotta spend my entire session claiming workshops or else I won't progress....
---
Nope. You can unlock them but can't claim the rewards.
---
This is going to end badly.
---
The Wendigo Colossus explains that though. Other miners who were trapped i nthe same conditions, eventually ate each other. How does one group turn into A VAST race of mole miners with a form of intelligence and machinery, and the other do what is normal to do in a mine collapse, which is eat each other, and then fantasy wise turn into a wendigo? 
---
It doesn't make sense. The most sense to me is that the mole miners are just mole rats that mutated and evolved to be humanoid. they wear the suits just because they're naked mole rats and gained a form of intelligence, so they wanted to cover up. The mutation might've made it hard for them to breath, so they wear filters, or they scavenged what the dead miners in the earth had on them.
---
If they didn’t have the greenhouse set I wouldn’t even bother honestly.
---
Bets build is bloodied sneak commando with full unyielding, one piece sneak four pieces sentinel with ap refresh leather or scout and weapons any BFFR or BE rifle would be ideal especially a fixer or handmade but 1* bloodied rifles also work, I personally use a sneak heavy weapon build but that’s focused around a certain weapon
---
Man, part of me kinda likes how crazy the legendary combinations could be if they didn't have limits on them, and what mods you could place on what
---
A "swing speed" boosted rifle sounds so hilarious 
---
But sucks that hackers are able to grief with that junk
---
Start giving out thousands of free atoms... just gonna assume thats whats happening to some people right now and someone's getting fired tomorrow lol
---
Quit pulling shit out of your ass.
---
Nice work.
---
I'll repeat the story of my introduction to Mole Miners (that no one will see since I'm late to the thread).
---
Playing during the beta I somehow teamed up with a random guy I think I met at an event or doing some quest, after a while he started fast traveling to different places, I initially was reluctant to follow as I wanted to do most exploration the normal way when the game released, but some reason I said fuck it, and followed him.
---
Followed him into hell. After the loading screen I was right inside the middle of a vast dark building with multiple levels and confusing walkways everywhere, and shambling in the dark were hunched over dark shapes. Spotting us they cried out in terrifying muffled almost human voices, all rage and belabored pain.
---
And they hurt us, with guns and wolverine claws they struck at us. We ran with no idea of where we were or where to go till we found a set of double doors and a loading screen hopefully to freedom. If we hadn't been in hell before we were now, blinding steam and pain, further disorientation and fear, not knowing whether we could make it through forward as our health dropped, or to return to the dark and the hunched terrors we had fled from.
---
Days and weeks later, as I played the game this confusing and terrifying experience started to make sense, we had traveled into Thunder Mountain Powerplant, the Mole Miners were much to high level for us, and we stumbled into the active cooling towers when trying to escape.
---
Many hundreds of levels later there's not much that can actually harm me, but I still have a reflexive fear reaction if I hear a Mole Miner yell at me if I'm not prepared. And I'd had a much better, though inadvertent introduction to them, compared to my second character just coming across a bunch viewable in plain daylight from a distance. 
---
I think Bethesda missed an opportunity to introduce them in Belching Betty with the Firebreathers, even though I know the point was to introduce the scorched as the big threat, I've never found scorched spindly design all that threatening, and I think the mole miners would have fit better there.
---
Hopefully we'll get a mole miner lair in the future to live up to the mystery and terror of my first experience of them.
---
I forget, will this affect vault steel and modules?
---
I don’t think mole miners can see properly. I think they are ghouls since their suits shouldn’t protect them from that much radiation from the nukes
---
It's definitely not the same quality.  My question is why is it not more BOS centric  since this is supposedly the BOS season?
---
I just want to kill mobs, blow shit up, and collect all the things.
---
Ah sorry
---
*okay antiduper*
---
It's more of a **major glitch/bug** every time you open up the atom shop. more and more atoms just get added in 
---
This certain bug has no effect on the in-game economy besides bethesda's pockets 
---
More than certain they'll hand out the *banhammer* since this was an issue on ESO before
---
Dang.. I’m trying to figure out if the red viper paints go well with the red shift items lol
---
Man i did not grind steel and lead in a looong time i know 2 place im gonna visit
---
Dude those are yours and they wont take them away. Feel free to spend them as toy please.
---
It me. Crowd control is my specialty, and it's better for me to protect the heavies than try to damage the big guy.
---
the other day i logged on to do my dailies and saw scorched earth get hit. I fast traveled before the event but right before it started. She was dead immediately, the i traveled to Colossal problem same situation. This is why i like the nerf. To many op weapons and bloodied is out of hand.
---
GET M OUT BOYS WE DID *it*
---
No problem! I could've sworn there was some mines there too, I guess not
---
I read that as 'entrails'. As in meat pile which is one of the rewards you get.
---
Check the blacklist.
---
Beth has actually done a halfway decent job with cap inflation, they are still useful and you don’t need millions.
---
Ok? I clean my car constantly even though its just gonna get dirty again. Its part of the upkeep.
---
Yup. Add cola nut and nuka-dark does too
---
That is another good point. I don't understand how ace is BOS, my guess is they are doing factions and BOS will be season 3. Who wants Chinese armor just curious. Its kind of a weird move on Bethesda part.
---
Turn off fallout that is what works for me
---
I'm pretty sure it's considered a container, so you would have to loot 60 containers and server hop for it to respawn.
---
They make new accounts each time.  Low karma don’t go first.
---
$$$
---
*”If atom challenges are broken, they’ll have to pay to get our shitty cosmetics that are also broken!”*
---
Yep, some rando left me with a unyielding scout armor piece today and left before I could thank them. They probably realized I was into that sort of thing since I was operating at about 8% health at the time haha.
---
When you loot something it goes on a list. You cannot loot that thing again until you pick up more items. Once you hit the magic number the firs thing on the list is then available to be looted again
---
The wood is still on the list. You need to pick up more items.
---
Idk a out you but im on playstation and dont keep any bankaccounts connected so i cant get charged.
---
Watch they are going to fix this in less than 1 week but the SCORE auto Compleat glitch will be part of all the seasons.
---
Yeah, it really was just loose speculation. It's more of a concern based on past things BGS has done to make this game grindy and I could see this not being out of the question.
---
Ultimately I expect it'll be the same as Season 1.
---
Do did fhe cloth complete even though it was like 90 mil shy?
---
Very nice Bethesda
---
Alright thanks, seems were in the same boat! Just wanted to make sure this wasn't a big glitch.
---
On PC and most of the people I play with are in the 50+ club, many retired with loads of time on their hands. If you have First and 6-12 hours per day to play its easy to get your scrap into 6 digits. PC is largely a different demographic than console.
---
Whaaaaaat I don’t usually have to do that at all! I don’t think I have ever come close to that many items before I have picked up more wood! I usually just served hop! Very strange though you could be right, I turned it off because I was getting mad but let me try again lol
---
Lemme try that rq!
---
Lol now show me them magazines! ;)
---
Feral ghouls are considered creatures but 'regular' ghouls are not. It is based on hostility more than anything. All ghouls are not actually ghouls, but people with extreme radiation poisoning that survived due to a specific gene. Ferals are the ones whose genes didn't protect their cognitive functions as well as the non-ferals. This is the same with the mole miners. Murmurgh is just a human who mutated into a mole miner, due to mutating while in a mining suit, who is of the few who is not hostile. One of the few of its kind like Graham is for the supermutants or  the few non feral ghouls in Appalachia
---
That would be a neat idea-darker wood armor held together by tentacles... and a unique mask made of black stone, like obsidian maybe? Hermaeus Mora is my favorite daedric prince so I’m all for this!
---
I use a flamer on em too. Not getting problems from it as far as I can tell.
---
I want that train set, hopefully you can interact with it
---
When you notice people buying over your limit, exit the server quickly.  Log back in and turn your vendors off.  I’ve hit max caps a few times and I just drop out.  I have a kill switch for my vending machines and lock them up.
---
if by fixed, you mean made closer to every other option. sure... because they are changing the damage calculation across the board
---
I wish this glitch happened to me
---
I haven't finished the main story and launched a nuke.    
---
Have done ACP b/c I don't know enough people and my main char probably would be useless and die very fast.    
---
I have max rep with the Raider and am shooting for the Garden plots. I like doing Biv's quests. I noticed doing the Tidy quest where you pick up toxic goo that you get Possum Badges at random times. I'd like to know how to get more but not doing those tedious Possume quests.    
---
Target Daily and Events. If I have room I put in stuff to sell. Script what I don't like or need. I've completed S1 so not much else to do.
---
Sweeeeeet really wanted it, probably collects cork and pre war money
---
We finished Cloth the day before the deadline.
---
Probably not.
---
You jack 'n apes!
---
nah just edit, be funny to see such a high number of atoms, thats millions of munny nobody would ever see in cash let alone in atoms :P
---
even if its just a bug still funny
---
Like the bug on second projectile hitting target
---
Just go get wood from elsewhere
---

---
Are you having difficulty with it? The robots messing you up? If so I have 2 or 3 modded pieces of Troubleshooters Forest Scout armor I could give you. And 1 piece of Unyielding Forest Scout if you are a bloodied build ill give you as well. I don't use them.
---
Weapons its your call. I did it with a Mutants Sledge hammer. Pain in the ass but its my playstyle.
---
I want Eugenie...she’s my best “Ghirl”
---
Appreciate you this is beyond annoying lol
---
Man what if they let you keep the atoms tho lol
---
Agreed! I love him in that DLC
---
turning vendors off only hides them from the map and someone can still stroll in and spend. Just in case you didn't know.
---
Ohhh I see more in depth to what your saying, let me try another spot
---
When I was still messing with grenades, I used him to get Nuka-Cola's easily to make Nuka Grenades. I also will use him as an quick check to see if my vendor cap limit has reset.
---
I didn't play the first Mole Miner treasure hunter event, because I feel sorry for them and didn't want to run around killing them just for loot.  Self-defense?  Sure.  But that just seemed wrong.
---
I'll admit, I wasn't entirely sure myself as it had been a while since I had the incident that OP had. All I had remember was getting killed at a cooking station by a mole miner out in front of Blackwater Mine. I tried finding a way to retrieve my loot, couldn't find a solution, and later had to abandon it. I just don't remember if I had tried the suggestion that others on this post provided. 
---
Yes, I had second guessed myself and assuming that the information I had provided may have been incorrect, decided to delete it. I'm confident now in where I stand as I had literally just tested it. In all seriousness, if there's something wrong that I did in my test, then please, by all means, correct me:
---
To make sure that the drop/death bag skin didn't change anything, set both to the default paper bag.
---
Test 1: Died to a raider, respawned, and dropped some loot next to the death bag and both bags remained as individual loot bags.

Test 2: Placed 2 loot bags just outside of range from one another so that they would not be compiled. Killed myself between the two and respawned. There were then 2 drop bags as well as the 1 death bag. Stood right next to the death bag and dropped 1 item. This compiled all the drop bags but the death bag remained separate.
---
On a separate test, it seems that drop bag skin doesn't keep the bags separate either. It'll simply move the first bag while adding loot to it. Ex.: Set drop bag to Vault-tec duffle bag and dropped loot. Remove skin in atomic shop and set drop bag back to default paper bag. Dropped loot within range and ended up with the vault-tec duffle at my feet instead of a paper bag.
---
Thats what I thought, my fiancé thought otherwise. I just logged out and in again hoping to swich server. My impression is that most people who are playing are really nice though.
---
Considerate and proactive of them (hearing that people have lost out on cards due to packs and dupes vanishing if you already have a star level of each card). Kudos.
---
if the maxs caps was higher the prices would be higher and if the max caps was lower the prices would be lower. It's all the same. 
---
but yes. i found out the max caps the hard way also.
---
Remember how they teased about being able to run for President?  Nothing ever came of that, did it?
---
That bone hammer sounds pretty awesome to me, not joking haha
---
This isn't happening to me but what will happen if you spend said atoms? Just curious.
---
For you, maybe.
---
If your on ps4 I can make you some weapons and armor to get by for a bit. Ammo and aid too
---
From earlier posts it seems people who completed the legendary run are taking a break after the grind.
---
They want to make explosive bait to grief people lol that's why they want it
---
I've been taking a break, check in on tuesday for whatever new CAMP items there are
---
The Bos doesn’t have vertibirds until Fo2
---
You can buy the interactive version in the atomic shop for 800 atoms
---
Hardcore daily casual solo play (is that a thing?).
---
I love building highly detailed camps, I love helping other players. I enjoy just exploring and being on my own, but enjoy the chance encounters with others when I run across them. I (did) enjoy playing with friends socially, but they quit playing, so I've been on my own for a while. Hoping one gets back into it this week before the next season starts.
---
I've switched builds twice, I tend to stick with one and leave it as I don't like to learn a whole new play style. I only have one character. I stick with chill outfits (one of the black long coats, cowboy hat). I chose a male as I wanted to feel more connected to my characters (most of my game characters are female in other games, I tend to stick with males for my more hardcore FPS/RPG style games like Fallout, FarCry, etc).
---
I don't like to tweak all the stats so minutely that I can 1shot bosses, it's just too much work IMO, thus the casual part I mentioned, but I do play for hours a day since day 1 release. My gear/stats/perks are pretty tweaked, but no so much that I am stuck with only one trick. It's good enough into the build I chose, and I'm fine with that. I'm not trying to hardcore find every last piece of perfect endgame gear with all perfect stats, but if I come across them, I'll buy them from a vendor on a casual basis.
---
I just enjoy the series, the art style, the play style, etc of the Fallout/Farcry  style games.
---
Fix VATs, the fast travel bug, and bring team PvP back.
---
Not to be the ass but someone has to ask is there anything that you did before hand so I can specifically avoid this.
---
Ya know it’s gonna be a good episode when her and Matt show up. That’s the dream team right there.
---
It also depends on what you’re rocking. I was able to burn down a bloodied commando who was 100+ levels than me but I had power armor and all the heavy weapons perks.
---
You have a point, at least I think the "vendors closed due to max caps" could be a good solution.
---
wait so the free one is not interactive. ugh
---
The autocomplete issue is from playing nw before playing regular mode.
---
Damn straight.
---
Yup that’s why I lock them up
---
I just want my MOTHERFUCKING POWER ARMOR DISPLAYS!
---
Just to be sure, are you talking about the elevator door seems to be stuck shut, not allowing you to access the button to go up or down the estate?
---
Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate!
---
On my main I'm just the perfect balance of hitting hard enough to make the game enjoyable but still able to die if I'm not paying attention. I'm not one shotting anything and there's no way I can solo any of the end game bosses but there's ammo everywhere and teams for a reason.
---
Also if you have them near a window, board up the window so they can’t be reached.  Mine are in a seedy shack and I have paintings over any window openings.
---
No I’m totally kidding
---
This same glitch is happening to me, I’m at 42500, please fix this, I don’t want any trouble.
---
Happened to me too... Imagine how wide spread this could be and those not reporting. I reported and it was half fixed. Had to report again. And then had it happened again. It's a weird thing. I now have to report something that greatly benefits me in fear it'll backfire and I'm not getting responses. I can't buy atoms and idk how many I've gained and had. Such a mess.
---
Looks like they did 👎👎
---
I thought there was supposed to be some kind of thing like the scanner in nuke silos that heals diseases?
---
I'm just a murder hobo...
---
You scared me lol
---
you realise you own everything cosmetic and have the epiphany that atoms are in fact pointless
---
Can someone link the rewards for me?
---
In have done 3 proper characters now, my first was just a mess with no particular build, mainly rocked explosive harpoons except for a faster fire 50cal for queen fights.
---
Second was a junkies commando which did me fine.
---
Then my finally build was a bloodied commando, 
---
All of them have suffered the same fate now and are retired from fighting to become traders instead. Seriously I spend more time vendor hopping and trading than I do killing stuff.
---
Increase camp budget and stash limit, then masturbate in Todd Howard's officr
---
Yes that’s right.
---
10x xp week for everything
---
With my mad shooting skills, I am better suited using my pole hook.
---
People return for updates, world events (fasnacht/ meat week) super sales, then disappear for a while; then they'll post on this sub,  "is this game worth returning to? " rinse, repeat,  it's an endless cycle.
---
As Rammadeus said, you can still buy even if the vendor machine isn't powered up, but can you lock them up so people can't buy? I didn't know that. 🤔
---
Its dead on PS4 when Im around too. No one is turning up for events. Having said that Ive only been logging on to check atom shop for freebies/specials and getting my daily bullion then logging off. Like many others Im taking a break from the grind until the new season starts
---
So this is where all those people are getting those atoms from...
---
Eventually you’ll be using all legendary gear
---
They said there was a problem with it currently.
---
It’s very much an inventory management game..
---
There’s not much I wanted only a couple of items in the first one but now the only thing I want is the BOS field station and the atoms because I’m a greedy mf
---
How will I eventually get all that?
---
when did you sign up?
---
When did you start fallout 1st cause it goes from the day you brought it
---
Overall, I think many are taking a break after legendary run. 
---
I still play consistently. If you are on ps4, you can add me
---
knew someone understood. harmony!!
---
Green house at 99? welp I guess fuck this whole season. Awesome how they gate this fucking direct import from fallout 4..
---
Lol I stated you can lock them up in my original comments and then followed up
---
Amen especially on that last one
---
By killing legendary enemies. Also the main quest awards a few pieces which I’m sure you’ve had a few by now.
---
It really doesn’t matter. If you keep all the gold you’ll need about 3 days of reputation grind to make up what you lose. If you honor your deal, you’ll do about 3 days of gold grind. Pick your poison.
---
Luck. Or buy it off other players.
---
I still don’t like the system, but this is a welcome change to it.
---
I mean someone could pick your locks and become wanted and then browse through your vendor...
---
- Honor the deal and you get +1000 rep with the primary faction; 500 Gold for you. 
---
- Modify the deal and you get +300 rep with the primary faction and +900 rep with the other faction; 500 Gold for you. 
---
- Break the deal and you lose 500 rep with the primary faction; 1000 Gold for you. 
---
You can earn 200 Gold per day from Treasury Notes. You can earn an extra 300 per week from Smiley, for 6000 caps.  Let’s average that out to 240 for easier calculation. 
---
You can earn up to 275 Settler rep and up to 235 Raider rep each day, with an additional +75 to either side, depending on the daily quests that are available and how you complete them. That’s 585 total each day. *(Note: This doesn’t factor in the Unmarked options or the Encounter options.)*
---
To gain the extra 500 gold you ‘lose’ if you honor or modify the deal, it takes **2.08 days**. Modifying the deal gets you a net rep increase of +1200, so that’s the better of the two choices. 
---
To regain the lost rep from breaking the deal (both the loss of 500 and missing out on the potential of 1200; 1700 total) would take 2.91 days. 
---
The best option, mathematically, is to do the Vault Raid with whichever side you have the *higher* reputation, and to modify the deal spilt the gold. The ‘lower rep side’ will get a bump of 900 rep and your chosen side will get a bump of 300 rep.  And you’ll recoup the ‘lost’ 500 gold in just over two days. 
---
Ultimately, though, there’s really less than a single day’s effort to ‘fix’ either the rep or gold gaps. 
---

---
Yeah, pretty much this.
---
Oh wow! And a god roll nocturnal pipe revolver?
---
I ask you; What is there to do right now?  
---
Most peoples "to do list" looks roughly like this:  
---
\- ~~Finish the main story~~  
---
\- ~~Finish Legendary Run~~  
---
\- ~~Do Events for Gold and buy your Weapons and Armor from bullions~~   
---
(if playing legendary run you should have around 400-1000 tokens to trade in by now, and you can trade in 20 per day)  
---
\- ~~Farm legendary~~ and get 250 scrip a day   
---
(most people have enough legendary fodder/excess misscrafted rolls/ caps to buy stuff from other players to reach this LOW limit)  
---
\- Try to get that sweet B/25/25 Fixer or what you want to play (mostly tied to market trading/spending your 4 days of burning crap for 1000 script cap/mooching ol earle bc he is the only one that guarantees a 3\* item at least)  
---
\- Farm events (sadly none are active right now)
---
I’m not sure tbh, I was kinda stuck at a stage where the main missions were impossible as my gun was awful but it’s getting easier now so I’ll be focusing on them soon
---
An then the elephant in the room, camp build still limited..
---
It’s not the Bos season. The BOS updates are separate from the seasons stuff
---
mine were all open and shit and i had no choice but to leave the game when i was close or on max. but i just redid my camp and stuck em inside a greenhouse dome and made a little sign that says MAX CAPS BRB
---
The best armors are leveled. Secret service armor requires you complete the wastelanders quest, and are level 50, scout armor plans sell in the enclave bunker and are level 50. After that, trapper, combat, and leather plans are easily available through whitespring vendors, and each has their strength and weaknesses.
---
really curious what level of interaction the foosball, shooting gallery and train will have.
---
hah, melee builds seem like a lot of fun to roleplay as, there's so many different weapons to choose from. 
---
For a doctor, I'd think something like a golf club or walking cane would best fit the theme. That, or a super sledge/power fist for the sciencey look.
---
Or wall glitch and not become wanted
---
The terminal should be removed and it should simply act like a vendor npc. Ammo points should just become like scrip.
---
