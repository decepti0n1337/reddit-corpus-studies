This is incorrect. The Enclave assassin mentions in the holotape that he was able to get into the bunker with the bypass holotape (and bitches about having to be close for it to work) and also hints at how to bypass the laser grid (mentions resetting it to give himself access).

I wish in-game there was a way to track player "karma" -- I know Xbox has it, but that's out of game.  I'd like something in-game, and cross-platform (I'm PS4)
---
Oh my bad, thanks for the clarification.
---
i usually have a few thousand rounds for sale in my shop and it always sells out. I sell everything for 1 cap, except for .44 and .38 which i give away for free. I don't sell any energy ammo, unless i make some UC fusion cells with my extra crimson flux.
---
Similar to the crashed witch? Possibly.
---
No problem. He didn't become deathclaw chow until he was on his way out.
---
Im not a fan of socialism.  If someone put in a lot of hours to earn something thats supposed to be exclusive  and hard to obtain then Im not a fan of it being given away just because of a pay subscription
---
end game rewards are not supposed to be easy to obtain
---
What I really don't get are the people that sell it for 2 and 3 caps per round. Like that's a lot of ammo taking up space. I can't imagine there's many people buying at those prices. I sell all ammo at 1c and have quite a few sales. I only use .556 and fusion cells. And those are the ones I see with double prices most of the time.
---
I like that collection of duped items you have there
---
No I’m not shooting the limb I’ll try that the percents are just to show the improbablity of it not crippling
---
Don't power it. Brilliant!
---
Where
---
[removed]
---
Your super rare mask collection in your display in the background
---
Oh, I like collecting the masks, they look pretty
---
GT: Raider OverBoss
---
Oh yeah, but they were mass duped not long ago along with loads of legacy weapons
---
Yea I heard, I've been considering getting rid of them but I like to display the "rarer" items
---
the games: you have to play them once, not just find them.
---
Somebody bought their comics, forgot them when they went to have a cup of Joe. When the bombs dropped, the comic book guy took everything to keep them in mint condition
---
Who the fuck cares, it’s always christmas
---
I use it when I switch to a heavy build on my 5 luck bloodied guy. It staggers things a lot, even when a few of my buddies wanna PvP a little, and they're geared up with sentinel assasin stuff
---
Was actually waiting for someone to say something like this🤣
---
Juicehead said something about outfits I swear. I could have heard it wrong. I mean they are adding elf outfits and santa to scorched so I dont see why we can't have Santa outfits
---
I've seen people selling the dress and I think the plan in their vending machines, but have yet to see a dead witch anywhere! I'd like to find it as well.
---
No need to bulk. I'm crafting ammo real quick and I'll join on you. Where abouts is your camp?
---
Hhhmmm
---
Word!
---
Ok Grinchthesda
---
Juicehead says alot but a lot of his stuff is speculation based on data miners and rumors. Speculation can change at a whim. Hell they could of pulled outfits in one of the hot fixes for all we know.
---
I love the idle animations and non agro'd animations of animals in the game. I'll watch my pet deathclaw at times and sometimes she stretches up to taste the air with her little forked tongue sometimes. It's kind of adorable.
---
I'd still give my firstborn (Joking) for those masks still. Never met a duper but the collector in me still hunts for them when I can.
---
😆
---
Hmm sports equipment? This idea pleases me. I'll have to go back to the drawing board.
---
Honestly, it makes sense they will push that to the atom shop, saddly. Which, I can also see it selling pretty well too
---
Ave. Thank you wastelander.
---
I had no idea about the groves. Been playing this whole time and never even walk through them. Will start doing so if there's actually stuff in there!!
---
I agree but increasing the frequency of the event pops up would make too much sense, so can’t see them doing it lol
---
It makes me so mad when someone clams your workshop, kills you and then leaves it in ruins
---
.45 sells pretty well.  5.56 sells the best.  
---

---
I sell a fair amount of 5mm and .308 too but the key is pricing it at 1 cap each.  
---
Anything more is just ridiculous
---
I'll probably tinker around without it and see if it's a noticeable difference. It's a tough call.
---
I sell tons of .308 and .50 cal for 1 cap.  Especially the .308.  Luckily i use .45
---
They never removed the TSE combo so I’ve got nothing to go off
---
I loved the Halloween event, ran it like 12 times a day for the whole thing, has kept me in money ever since ;-)
---
Read this subreddit, people have already your questions plenty of times in previous posts.
---
I cant join you, shown offline.
---
Completely agree, NPCs wont make the game what it was hyped to be. But itll be nice having a living town to walk into instead of just an barren territory. Hopefully trade becomes more useful, I'd like s more functionali way to sell ammo.
---
People buy 50 from me at 1cpr I put every ammo in there at 1cpr except 38 which is free. But if you put too much in there for free one person will just come and take all your free ammo and resell it. If it doesn’t sell and I need the room I’ll take the ammo out and dump it in front of the vault
---
You and every wastelanders this side of the Commonwealth.
---
On ps4 the 1 month isn't a subscription.
---
To check go to settings, then account management, account settings, playstation subscriptions
---
Aw. Personally, I've never been into the taxidermied heads, so it's kinda disappointing to me that this seems to be the big draw of the Christmas event.
---
&gt;s added at the same time as the Burrows, as of this writing (Nov 20, 2019) none of the Fallout wikis mention this particular entry.
---
\*0.001%
---
The Unstoppable Monster one shots things with ease and it doesn't double dip. Why? The 40% more power attack damage. For general mobbing Swing Spead is always better but for "boss" killing the 40% on any Bloodied Unarmed is insane, especially on a Puncturing Power Fist. 
---
Once damage numbers get past 1500 you are more or less guaranteed to one shot any mob out there. Adding more damage is just unnecessary. One shotting a 3* Level 80 Scorchbeast is fun but still being able to kill it in 2-3 swipes is still just cheesing the game. 
---
Also, with over 300 hours in as a bloodied unarmed I can say it's insanely easy and simple. 
---
 - Food buffs are nice but not at all needed. It goes back to the damage numbers I mentioned earlier.
---
 - Really the only drugs you need are Stimpacks, Radaway, Rad-X Diluted/Radshield, and Psychobuff if you really went to use a chem. Totally fine without. 
---
 - Here's all the perks that are required for Bloodied Unarmed. Iron Fist 3, Radicool, Serendipity 3, Nerd Rage 3, and Starched Gene's 2. That's it. 
---
The other perks are just quality life and used for any Melee build out there. Incisor 3, Traveling Pharmacy 3, Martial Artists 3, Blocker 3, Fireproof 3, Adrenaline 5, Action (Gender) 3, and Class Freak 3. 
---
Perks you could just have on hand are Lone Wander 2 or 3, Field Surgeon, and Makeshift Warrior 5.
---
 - Gear? Any 1* Unyielding level 35-50 is good and all you need. Higher end armor, mods, and even 2* or 3* are just Quality of Life improvements. 
---
The handmade isn't even the best gun out there. So much better alternatives to crowd control. But as a bloodied melee you just Leroy Jenkins your way into groups of enemies. No skill needed apart from being able to press the attack button.
---
If you quit because you need that max 80% damage from 12 perk cards (Absolute waste of cards by the way. Just use 6 and you are golden) then I hope you find another game out there for you. 
---
To make a weapon amazing all it needs is the Bloodied prefix. Best one in the same in terms of pure damage.
---
The Tesla does not count as a heavy weapon. Its classification changes based on the barrel type you use.
---
Your 4k tv should be able to have (automatically switch) separate settings, game mode for xbox one and the default  hdr (soap opera effect) for tv and movies mode.
---
Do not try to "optimize" by turning off soap opera effect settings because everything will look awful. Tom cruise made a psa video urging people to disable soap opera effect to watch action films but he's full of shit.
---
This is exactly why I don’t want shared servers across platforms. I’m glad the exploitation on Xbox isn’t to this extent...
---
Ah. Well then I could roll some points into per for rifle/commando.
---
No it counts as a Rifle.
---
Well for Agi, 2 points in Adrenaline and one in Born surviver to be safe.
---
Then like i said get rid of L&amp;L and get Lifegiver on End.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also the flamer likes to get destroyed in like two full tanks, so idk if gunsmith would be a good choice too. Dunno about the Cryolator, but keep in mind that you get 3 adv repair kits everytime you kill the Queen and u can use them on the fly.
---
Yeah I understand..but times have changed with the micro transaction/live service stuff/multi-player all of which is very new stuff for Bethesda.. Give them time they have done ALOT with fo76
---
I received mine this morning, but others hadn't yet.
---
Just go for it... You'll learn with every death.
---
Agreed Got the stash box, Nuka clock,  Backpack, The power armor, think I can see a Nuka dark Skin in near future  that'd be badass
---
I want that nuka Cola wall paper and lights that's in the fanboy room
---
Thankyou!

Unfortunately it's the only platform it can be found for now, though sure there's some creative ways you could get just the audio.  
---
I couldn't ask for a better bunch of gaming friends honestly.
---
And more poster/decoration
---
They aren’t easy to obtain. They still need to grind for plans. The only reason they got this is to compensate for their entire scrap inventories being deleted.
---
I think you misunderstand what happened... I also think you misunderstand what socialism is. They were being compensated because a bug deleted their entire collections of scrap.
---
happens to me quite a bit.  I've found it helpful to walk for about 5-15 seconds to somewhere else then try to ft again.
---
I’ll take 12
---
Really .308?  I’ll have to start making that!
---
I have the exact same issue with the Grognak magazines. Wasted a bunch of time collecting them all again in case that worked but it seems that once it's bugged it's bugged.
---
Your theory makes sense. It does just seem to be battle of the consoles. Unfortunately, PC doesn’t trump this one, I would love the to play PC just too much of a noob. Lol
---
You are getting $16.50 US in atoms a month. Already more value than the monthly subscription price.
---
How was it?
---
I use lvl 1 in both pve and pvp; it does proc in pve, but pvp encounters are usually so short, it doesn't matter anyway...
---
I’ve had 5 disconnects over the course of 4hrs first time playing in over a month I thought we where past this 😒
---
I agree. Whilst I love when some one pays like 6k for all my ammo I don't use it doesn't sell well
---
.308 I can never have enough of... .50 and 5mm I carry like 2000 of no problem. My LMG eats .308 like no tomorrow though... what do you burn through the fusion cells with?
---
As a Fallout 1st member you can build the scrap box. Your camp, others camps, and workshops. Only 1st member get unlimited storage but it doesn't disappear. It's a camp item.
---
I finished the main story on three toons and played since beta so I have a pretty good grasp of where it started and where it is now. Not good enough in my brutally honest opinion, doesn't mean I can't still enjoy it at the right time and I do hope it turns out great with Wastelanders update and new quests.
---
How does that work?
---
Oooh good to know.
---
It just wasn't popular enough.  Didn't make sense for them to continue developing on something so few played.
---
 It also gives them a chance to make waste Landers really good without having to balance 2 modes.
---
Life giver is good. And thanks Last I saw it was labeled as heavy but thats the internet for ya. 
---
I usually pick up weapon artisan first moment I get it. Just for that reason.
---
Find a container in the world with unlimited storage. Load it up. Swap over to another character and pick up the stuff your stored.
---
...huh
---
Lmao I swear it's not what it looks like haha
---
Huh what?
---
Most subscription services auto renew unless you change the settings. It is not a shady practice. And they even tell you when you get fallout 1st, that it auto renews.
---
What exploitation?
---
I'm on pc yea
---
Definitely better than a downboat.
---
I find it shady because the option to manage it is pretty hidden.
---
What do you mean by " Bad move by Bethesda to give out 600 V94 steel "?
---
Depends on what hardware you are using perhaps. My newly built AMD Rayzen n Radeon card seems to b unstable even in windows environment for no reason.
---
I was having crashes even in steam game
---
Honestly mate it's not even worth it. Me &amp; my teammates don't even bother with the place any more because it's too much hassle for too little a reward &amp; that doesn't even include people stealing it from you. The bullet output is extremely slow &amp; you use more bullets Defending it than the ones you actually get out of it. You're better off farming the materials &amp; making them yourself.
---
I like to use laser weapons with my BoS commando. He carries an anti-armor faster fire automatic Tesla rifle and an automatic burning instigating laser rifle. Tons of fun and a bit of lore.
---
It is one of the most expensive ones to make. Pricey in terms of materials, because you craft a small amount.
---
I cannot place crafting benches inside the Atom Shop Vault-Tec canopies, i get the same notification but never found a work around so I use a regular large tent. I can place my camp vendors underneath them though. It happened some patches ago, used to never be an issue.
---
There's a Legion outfit?
---
Added you 🙂
---
Your poor miscellaneous tab 😥
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
Someone sniped it at a distance ;)
---
Being lvl 22 I'd make my way south to the ash heap. Be sure to stop by Poseidon energy plant and check the military trucks for a gas mask before you go. Also take you a shot gun, pistol and good rifle with plenty of ammo for them. If your in need of ammo clear out Poseidon of all scorched and loot only ammo or take and hold the work bench out front to mine lead ore. For base/camp placements find you a place that has either a lead or steel deposit and build a temp base there. I have mine at a steel deposit by Greg's mine supply. Also food,food and more food you never go with out it and water. Also for leveling up the closer your enemy is to you the better. Good rule of thumb on enemy levels go only 2-3 over what you are for best results. You get xp for pretty much everything in some way. Also having 3-4 bases in blueprint is a good thing. As long as you have the materials to make them. Grab all the frag grenades and mines you can carry to sell to a vendor for caps. Use molotovs for ghouls and scorched and some animal enemies. Perks are good but that's up to how you play. And finally grab only the weapons that are your level range and grab them as often as you can and scrap out all of them but the best.
---
Xbox?
---
Yup
---
IDeathknell
---
Get a job
---
You must be an older brother
---
What?
---
Found it at the location you gave me, thank you!
---
I have the one year subscription and checked mine today. I think they renew Adams and all of that the same day that you subscribed, but a month later obviously
---
You have a new character too?
---
It will be fixed the day before I buy Fallout 1st.
---
Send a friend request or invite and let me know when you’re ready to trade, I’m actually off line but I’ll see the invite and get on when you do or you may send me your gamertag
---
Hey I’ll help!
---
if it took 60-100 hrs for a player to earn 600 vault steel, should someone be given it for free that has never ran a vault?
---
If your on Xbox I got 40mm Fernandez I would like to get rid of
---
Yes i am
---
For real!!! Yay. I am just finishing watching a cartoon with daughter and wife then I will jump on.
---
I deliberately turned off auto funding for my psn wallet a few days ago. Earlier I got an email saying my fallout 1st subscription had ended because of payment failure. I think it auto renews even though it isn’t listed as a subscription in settings.
---
A little sharp but besides that it was good
---
hit weightrooms for lead and WV lumber for gunpowder/steel then craft a bunch of it.
---
alternatively most people sell 5.56 for 1c each
---
Cool I’ll be online in the next 30 or so.  Ten23Seventy7
---
If you have a nice head set the background noise of the fires and stuff help the immersion
---
Do you use Unyielding armour or anything that messes with your carry weight?  This seems related to the issue.  I too have 1 char that \*never\* experiences this bug and several that often do.
---
Ok I sent a friend request, thank you.
---
Weightrooms?
---
SSD or mechanical? My specs are pretty close to yours, and I found running off a big slow 2Tb mechanical drive caused stutters and lag in all sorts of places I didn't expect.  Switching to an SSD made a ton of difference. (fixed everything for me basically)
---
Yeah. First time I walked by a squirrel it made a noise and died. I was like WTF??? Then it happened again and I figured it out. I've seen posts with people complaining about losing tamed animals or other players killing them so I thought it might be relevant but I don't have the animal friend perk so I can't test it myself but thought someone would probably find this useful.

like a workout room, i personally dont hit them but i know there is one in Charleston fire department, and another in the hotel between flatwoods and overseers camp (name escapes me rn)
---
Farm scorch beasts. Always do surface to air. Hop servers and kill scorch beast at the two fissures in the bog
---
There are Fatman, plasma grenade, AND power armor plans on that list! Yay!
---
Wait a minute, so according to the leaked lootable notes in the pawn shop, you're doing more detective work and following on the footsteps of dead npcs again?!?! So let me get this straight, Bethesda thought we wanted more content about dead npcs??? Am I supposed to be just an errand boy for a faction in order to find some sort of treasure? Gold isn't even that useful in game what could anyone need right now that isn't grindable?
---
I’ve had to try around 10 times before to get into an event before, it’s ridiculous! Especially once you join a server and try to fast travel when you spawn in, takes a few tries at least. Oh well, hopefully they fix it soon. :)
---
I buy all the 5.56 I can get. I'll buy it up to 3c if I can't find any other on the server cuz I'm too lazy to server jump.
---
Low level but have a fixer eh.
---
Not gonna lie, first time I played in the Ash Heap with my HD 58Xs I didn't do much but enjoy the ambience.
---
That is a Microsoft thing not a Bethesda thing.
---
Mods gotta do something bout these beggars
---
Ik theres not a ton of them but seeing these posts is hella annoying. The games not even hard how lazy do you have to be
---
Level 30. I'm seeing level 200+ people everyone so I'd consider myself to be a low level
---
I put in a ticket with bethesda last week because the sub didn't show up in my psn subscription list and that's what they told me. Also my month ended today and it didn't auto renew. Did you maybe pick the year sub for the cheaper monthly price?
---
Impressive.
---
Me a  level 240 and another level, i think he/she was 170 +,just the 2 of us, took one out on PS4 last night.
---
Didn't think we were going to do it.
---
We did,my proudest moment .
---
SBQ Glitched out making it  a bit easier, it landed for time and we blasted it
---
I used an explosive 50 Cal with all the Perks and explosive Bobblehead.
---
I kid you not i went through about 7,000 rounds of 50 Cal blasting it point blank in the face.
---
Spent all day today mining Lead/Acid to replace my Ammo.
---
Think i will give it a miss in future if there are only 2 of us.
---
No mate, it's just a fridge with a skin. Like the Arktos Pharma Fridge. That's all to it. As much as I want it to, it's not gonna be able to give you Ice Cold Nuka Cola
---
I paid for a month only. I was of the impression it wouldn’t auto renew as there wasn’t an option to cancel it anywhere but also didn’t want to pay for another month anyway as taking a break until the next seasonal event.
---
Me too, my Senheisser HD650 are amazing when moving through these dungeons, they are old now but still great.
---
Can play junkies at full HP using vanguards and selectively choose withdrawals with minimal combat stat effects. Not sure about the damage, but you're not a glass cannon at least.
---
I say, you're man of culture aswell, brother. Although i prefer Explorer Outfit to hide all my gear and look completely defenseless.
---
Never had speakers (neighbours) headphones are pretty great for this game.
---
I'm not hating man, all the good stuff is duped I'm sure. There are way to many top tier handmades in circulation for that to not be true. I'd hate to play on pc though man.
---
Bloodied is really low health.  You can mitigate that with the right perks and gear, but it takes a bit of work.
---
Junkie's is not as much DPS, but you're running at full health (minus whatever you lose from the addictions, which you can choose).  So it's 'safer', but lower damage.
---
Really it's a personal choice, and will depend on how much you want to invest in the build.
---
You can also just perk right and go aa. No negative effects at all that way and damage is still awesome.
---
It did not break during the fight but it eat thru the 200% bar and about halfway thru the main bar
---
I usually only sell 5.56, .308, shells in my vending for 1c. I do put some lower costing ones in as well but with a sign that says to message me for cheaper ammo, usually 4 for 1c.
---
I believe you should travel west. And change your name to J. Graham.
---
Bloodied build here,  rads is important
---
Sometimes peeps are curious. There should be something like unsolved mysteries or trivia described in post, because Bethesda did some work for the game.
---
I noticed this too. I tried 3 different weapons.
---
J. Graham... Joshua... I think I'll name my first son that.
---
Me too. 
---
I can't see why they'd want to make it more of a slog and grind.
---
Whoa. This is a game changer! 
---
It's such an immersive experience. It actually feels like a heavy rainstorm is pelting down onto me. Feels so real!
---
Bloodied all the way u get used  to having low health u become one with radiation.
---
Possible for some time now and pretty rare.
---
Also same with ultracite plans.
---
Ive been running a Berserker's build for a few months now. Its easily my favorite build. Its challenging and keeps things interesting. If you build it right, its not that dangerous.
---
I would be willing to bet that a game pad, with two joy stick controllers (effectively) delivers superior movement to that of a mouse and keypad. I have seen guys move in NW and thought, "I can't do that, not that fast."
---
Are you monthly or did you get a year?
---
Are you monthly or did you pay for a year?
---
Are you monthly or did you get A year?
---
Mine didn't renew and I didn't get an email like you did. Another confusing Bethesda moment for a lot of people. Their website also has conflicting information on it so idk. All i know is my experience and mine didn't auto renew
---
Yea, handmade bloodied its a beast thats my go too.
---
When were you charged for your second month?
---
The game needs a lot of QoL improvements. Fallout 4 is very clunky and even though Bethesda has improved on the game engine, it's still very clunky.
---
The Modding community is faster at releasing said QoL improvements. Yet here we are with things like more wallpaper...
---
 I did about four days ago but I haven't run across any Nuka quantum in a while
---
As well as the things people come up with in order to have fun in the game. I appreciate and admire creativity, but I saw a post the other day about making a McDonalds-looking camp. Shit, I wish I could find that even remotely worth doing.
---
its because of the diseases, it doesnt kill if you arent diseased
---
Coming 2021 after delays
---
It's a completely different model. It's not out yet and it isn't a fridge skin. We can only speculate as to what it is, but it isn't the same as the other fridges released which were just different skins on the same object.
---
Account management&gt;Account information&gt;Services list&gt;Scroll down to fallout 76 and click it&gt; Click the one that says subscription and turn off auto renew
---
To add to it, I had the same thing happen when trying to craft nuka quantum grenades. Regular nuka grenades worked fine, but I would get the "cachunk" sound when trying to make the quantum grenades and nothing to show for it.
---
Little tip I've found(if it hasn't been patched). When something is damaged but not broken, you can store it and replace it and it will have no damage.
---
People can buy from unpowered vendors, all the power does is put you on the map. I only ever have 1 powered, and have always sold things out of all the machines.
---
Patched out AFAIK. Can't store broken stuff.
---
It's just a few notes mate, there's always been loads of them in Fallout games as well as parts of quests being carried by termimal entries and the like. Plus this just essentially text that's been datamined and we still haven't even really seen proper gameplay either so don't jump to conclusions just yet.
---
Best way is during Campfire Tales. Also just north and east of Bailey Family Cabin in the upper northeast section of the Mire there is a daily quest, Queen of the Hunt, that has this same location marked.
---
Damaged not broken.
---
It's unusual, but they can drop some of those plans and things.  Seems like a really low chance, though I've already got most of them and I'm not sure if that prevents them from dropping.
---
No griefer only "damages" an arch. They either break it or miss it entirely.
---
This doesn't really have anything to do with "clunk". And FO4's building was way better than 76's is.
---
Someone said if you learn the plan they don't drop again but this is the first time I saw it on a regular scorchedbeast
---
Very true😔
---
Pro tip : You should be on a team when you dig maps , All team members next to the dig site get rewards not just the person who digs . So if 4 team members have 10 maps each you ALL get 40 maps worth of rewards.
---
Sort that tab by weight.  The things you care about are the top 2-5 items.  It makes the misc tab not so horrific.
---
Bloodied by far outclasses the Junkies builds. With the right perk cards and minimal gear you can really negate a lot of damage. I have at least 3 bloodied builds across my accounts and they're tanky af with not much outside of mixed and matched pieces of decent gear. None of my stuff is a God roll besides my BE RW 50 weapon. Other than that, it's all middle of the road and decent lower unyielding/bolstering pieces of gear. If you want, I can go into the build and post a link with all the cards and setup that I'm running on my bloodied heavy PA build.
---
&gt;It's not out yet and it isn't a fridge skin
---
How can you be so certain that it *isn't* just a fridge skin? Several power armor skins change the appearance but they're still just skins. There was a Grill up for sale on the atom shop that was just another Cooking Station. I'm pretty heavily sure it's just gonna be nothing more than a Nuka-Cola-themed fridge
---
You can not buy or trade for V94 steel.  The only way to get it is to put in the hours (work for it).  I would bet anything no one in the game lost 600 vault steel or even close for that matter and then many were given said vault steel that had never even ran a raid (done the work).  Even if my comparison was slightly a stretch, I am well aware of what socialism is and if you have put a shit load of time in to running vaults (often failing), you might have a different opinion
---
 Feels bad man, it is so scummy that Bethesda is using the opportunity to suck even more money out of people.....
---
I've seen it a couple times, but I may have gotten to the point they don't drop - I've killed a *ton* of them lately and haven't seen anything.
---
Random cave...bloatfly cave.  Top of the mire.  Near Freddie Fears.   Has a dead brahmin floating in a pool of water.
---
I would doubt it. The whole point of the DLC is the mystery surrounding the treasure vault, so any new notes references bunker construction are almost certainly for Vault 79.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Can't speak because I'm not 100% certain, but when putting items into the scrapbox, unlimited stash, when you're over max capacity for carry weight it does not destroy the item(s). I found somebody crawling around WS really slow and guy shot me, probably on accident, but I returned fire and in his bag he had like 18k pcs of steel on him. He didn't seek revenge or respawn so I stashed it all in my scrapbox without any issue. 
---
But if you were over max capacity and tried to drop any of the items into the world outside of the scrapbox, it would destroy it. But it **"should"** pop up a message saying that this item(s) cannot be dropped and will be destroyed and an option to drop it or cancel.
---
Personally, if I were you, I would stash 1 bone shard or whatever worthless scrap item into the scrapbox and see what happens. It should allow to you do so because it's exactly just that, an unlimited box for crafting materials only. Can't put weapons, ammo, armor, aid or any misc items into it. Just junk materials for crafting. Hope this helps you out.
---
Yeah, I’ve got mine from Fallout 1st subscription
---
I hope you so. SWTOR is free right now. As is Destiny 2
---
I am level 240 and still tweaking my cards here,and there.
---
The beauty of it is the longer you play this game, the more you can change entire Perk builds to suit the game play.
---
SBQ  you can go fully Heavy Gun Build.
---
Afterwards equip Perks to walk away with all your loot.
---
Then revert back to the day to  day 50/50 Gun/Melee Perk build.Or whatever build you prefer.
---
i did my first ever 2 man kill of a SBQ last [night.Me](https://night.Me) a level 240,the other being level 170 + it Was not easy,i went through 7,000 rounds of 50 Cal ammunition. on my explosive 50 Cal,with explosive Bobblehead,The other gamer was using a laser. Gatling.We killed it with about 5 minutes to spare.Anyone who does this solo really  does deserve a  Medal.
---
I have walked away in the past when there have been 3/4 lower turn up doing nothing for a free lunch on your ammunition at SBQ event.
---
Full respect to my partner.We both died Once,and Stim each [other.Team](https://other.Team) work is the secret.
---
Felt like a real achievement........
---
Until i just read someone killing SBQ solo with a flick Knife
---
Same man, that’s why I only take them on private servers now.
---
Yes, that's the point of the mutation. But it's been reported to have no negative side effects but if you like non aggressive wildlife or you have the animal friend perk this may matter to you.
---
Bloodied combined with sneaking and you can average 1 - 1.5k damage per shot with a explosive handmade. Don’t really need to worry about the low HP when there’s less than 6 creatures in game that can’t be one shotted.
---

---
My guess is it will be our way of selling ammo to human NPCs. I kinda hope it is in the form of the ammo boxes. I always liked them. Could put a box of shotugn shells on my new display case.
---
Got Private world for that if needed, though I'd need a lot more than they tend to provide for the ore I collect. Wouldn't hurt to use it to supplement though.
---
Never been there, thanks for the tip!
---
This
---
Beth responded to this and said it would be patched.
---
My guess is it is just a reskin of the fridge. Honestly if we were going to get any new Nuka Cola machines, i'd want them to be the Capital Wasteland or Mojave model and would light up when powered. Lord knows i'd be selling my Nuka Darks from it.
---
Having the ability to bulk ammo into boxes would still be very helpful and give us more pricing flexibility. Most ammo may sell at a cap a round, but that still isn't the best way we could be doing this.
---
Pistol calibers like .38, .45 and 10mm could be bulked into boxes of 50 rounds. Rifle calibers like .308 5.56mm and .50 could be bulked into boxes of 20 rounds. Other firearm ammo like .44, .50 ball and shotgun shells can be bulked into boxes of 25.
---
I'm basing these numbers on common quantities for real ammunition, but it could be different easily.
---
Why would they be free
---
"If"
---
lol
---
hmmmm I don't know, that's a tough question...  
---
And it's not like Steam forces the metrics to be shown or anything...
---
Too further add to this. You can get rolls on Sheperds Crook, Sheepsquatch Club, Sheepsquatch Staff, and Bear Arm if you know the plan.
---
pigs, kind've sad really
---
I wish I had privet servers but I’m not going to pay that much every year on a game I already bought for 60$

B L O A T F L I E S

Fallout first is great.and I'm glad its a pay to have feature.
---
They also sometimes spawn at The Freak Show and Dolly Sods
---
scaleform memory is related to the Pipboy as I understand it...  
---
Since you're on PC what sorting or other mods do you have installed?
---
Many thanks, that's much appreciated as straight an answer as I've been able to find so far
---
Cheers for that
---
Alot of people have been saying that it should have released with free private servers. They dont know that the. Majority of players would have hid in private servers .also killing the PvP aspect of the game.
---
This was happening at Posieden energy when i was farming fusion cores.
---
7/8 Turrets all started firing at the Stash Box simultaneously.
---
I moved the Stash Box out of sight and they started destroying each other.
---
One of the Turrets was the ring leader.I scrapped it,and the others stopped attacking each other.
---
Weird.
---
The fallout first box ?
---
Still the 23rd. Sunday 24th
---
Im a subscriber and still log in on a public world predomainately.
---
Today is Sunday.
---
Time zones exist, my friend.
---
Also hit the Kanawha County Cemetery
---
I was standing in my camp and a level 245 constantly attacked me then picked a lock in my camp to become wanted then attacked me. One of my passive mutation effects responded to his attack as he was wanted then proceeded to destroy me, my whole camp, and my teammate while using a stealthboy and tesla rifle, in about 45 seconds.
---
So respectfully PvP in the adventure mode is broken and is really only for workshops but yet when you still school people with legendary weapons in about 3 seconds it is still terrible design then.
---
I have fof, but I spend the most of my time in adventure mode. Unless I'm doing farming/hopping and/or building then I use the private. I like the adventure mode for the random players and their camps.
---
Nice I mostly did this post to see how many people are opposed to paid private servers. But all of you are with it.which brings me to the assumption that the majority of people complaining about paid servers don't even play the game.these same people are criticising the game and spreading lies when they dont have enough gameplay to even have a valid opinion.keep on keeping on my fellow fallout first members .
---
Hoping for it as potential item.
---
FYI you can get them from dogs during scorched earth, tho not sure if they still drop.
---
I'm guessing it's was originally just an Easter egg to armored dogs from fo4. But in interviews speaking about Wastelanders, developers confirmed the ability to have companions, and when broached on the subject of a possible animal companion, they neither confirmed nor denied the possibility.
---
Left over asset from Fallout 4 apparently. Possibly we can use it later.
---
&gt;not buying FO1st would be the major leverage the players could have 
---
&gt; many felt powerless and blamed the ones the surrendered to paid subscription.
---
Just a couple things I'd like to say...first, thank you for a reasoned response, without vitriol! I fully expect for the OP to get major downvotes, myself as well, but as one of the first responses I appreciate you gave a "real" reply. 
---
Second, I'm not a part of some movement nor do I care to "fight the power" of the "evil, greedy " publisher. I'm at a place in my life that I'm doing well for myself and my family...I work hard and it comes with a lot of stress. I chose to play FO76 to relieve some of that stress and lose myself in a game series that I've played since the first one came out...prior really as I played wasteland prior to that. To me, $10 a month is a pittance for what I get out of it. 
---
People can chose to play or not, getting on players cases because they don't fall in line with the shrill yelling of the mob is just plain  fascist...there was never a chance Beth was going to decide to scrap the subs if they didn't sell, they'd just scrap the whole damn thing and so I'll support it instead.  Those in the mob can call me a shill all they want, I'll still play and keep my sub and they'll reap the benefits of that as the servers will stay up and content will get delivered. I somehow doubt they'll ever be grateful,  it's not what this generation does, but I'm sure they'll take without a thought of the irony of it
---
Sounds like your build isn't made to handle PvP.not many players are.I can tank a TESLA all day .but my build is made specifically for PvP.it isn't your fault you didn't know that you inflict damage on people who have bounty with mutations that pop.well now you Do!and I'm sure you have learned and will not make the same mistake. Basically you got outplayed. Don't talk all of PvP down because of one negative interaction.
---
I’m thinking about a third one why
---
Disagree. Vendors would be useless. People want to use private servers for specific situations; taking all workshops for resource grinding, better loading times with vault raids, etc.
---
But doing things that could be done on a normal server, require server hopping or need large amounts of people; general gameplay, farming legendaries in places like West Tel, the Queen, then it's either better or necessary to use public world's, as then you can have your vendor open making money and visiting other vendors also.
---
i use private server to move items between characters and that’s basically it.

#MAKESCRAPBOXFREE

Oh my god, is that your fucking hobby man? He pathetic are you. To op: he told me that „blue screening is a windows thing only“ too in the comment section of my post where I called the blue screen appearing on my PS4 after a crash „bluescreening“. This was a week ago or sth like that. How pathetic is that lol... you must be very busy at your IT job!
---
Someone should find out a reason why you have to face a certain direction when you spawn. Maybe based on the direction your facing when you place the spawn
---
Sure he could have reported it and you can fault him for that, but when actual cheaters are given slaps on the wrist the lifetime ban is inexcusable. Especially when the community that seeks these exploits out and reports them vouched for him.
---
But given the fact that they also apparently banned the one who reported it, the argument's moot. Since this process seems to be okay with the devs because it obviously helps a lot to know as much as possible about a bug or exploit it's likely another department being obtuse, intentionally or not.
---
Wasn’t it 24 years? That was your answer to me! I’m confused now, pls elaborate me what’s right now mister IT guy.
---
Fissure hopping works well for me, but I'm nearly 500, i can make at least a level in a few circuits. Grinding gets old for me, so I don't push, but with the beasts plus all their adds, works well for me.
---
As [CodySydney](https://www.reddit.com/user/CodySydney/) said, using SSD instead of of mechanical hard drive can make a big difference. Walk into one of those bigger places in game and the SSD is much faster loading area, while game slows down and has to catch up for mechanical drive.
---
Bloodied is always the answer.  Junkies is solid, but there is just so many other perks and armor abilities and mutations that synergize with Bloodied it is simply stronger.  Junkies and many other builds are completely viable, this game really does not demand a full min-max build.
---
Always be well rested have cranberry relish and Leader Bobbleheads and have max int and farm nuked whitesprings or west tek
---
Sometimes shit happens and things get missed that is life.  Posting here will get nothing done, maybe another ticket will.
---
Is say serving hopping westek &amp; throw in a couple of xb1 fights in as well. Make sure you boost your intelligence &amp; try to stay well rested or eat scorchbest brains from memory.
---
Good, hope it gets resolved for you.
---
&gt;Just because I have the sub it doesn't change your, or anyone else's,  gameplay a bit.
---
Factually not true. As I stated, pay2win incentivises Bethesda to make a sub-optimal game and you reward them for this. If the Atom store was cosmetics-only, sure the rest of the player base (who also paid money to play btw) will look a little less cool but there would be nothing mechanically that would be different with gameplay.
---
You and I both know that this game isn't mechanically the same for those that pay for Fallout 1st and utility items than those who don't. There are multiple accounts by your fellow Fallout 1st subs that clearly admit that the scrapbox and tent are pay2win items that give a clear advantage.
---
Now that's separate to whether or not you should feel bad about spending money for these advantages. That isn't the case that's being presented. Just that Fallout 76 unquestionably has pay2win items. 
---
You can use weasel words to say it's pay2convenience or diminish the magnitude of the advantage. The one thing that cannot be disputed is that, especially with Fallout 1st, gives you an advantage.
---
Agreed. Let the spoils get to everyone.
---
ok, you got me there. Still doesnt change anything though.

It's marked as an ATX object, so most likely it is a new fridge skin.
---
Did you renew the day that it ended or were you charged ahead of time? Trying to see if it's a matter of when the renewal went through. 
---
I had subscrived day one myself, but I went out and bought a new PS card today and manually extended it.  So trying to see if that's why I didn't get it and others did (same thing happened to my buddy).  
---
Also wondering if maybe it will go through in the morning, is it a script that went through and adds it
---
The challenges have been getting noticeable less grindy since patch 14 IMO. I haven't seen a camera challenge in awhile or a hunter hunted challenge.
---
Thank you.
---
Nooo.we pay for a reason.they want one then they should pay too.
---
Yeah, I didn't get mine (and it's a weekend, so tough to get responses on tickets) but I didn't get mine when I renewed today, but I don't know if it'll go in tomorrow or what not, since I manually renewed today.  
---
Just trying to troubleshoot with who did and did not get their atoms
---
Private servers are useful. But you don't get as many people on them, meaning you can't randomly find, say, queen fights. Also you need public servers to advertise and sell your stuff in your boxes. In short...no.  Everyone I know with private servers use them, primarily, for dailies that require access to specific commonly over-farmed areas, building bases without being bothered, and resource farming.
---
God yes. I've been wanting this since release, it's horrible. 
---
People bring up traps, but that can still be done, so making it easier for people to find 99% of players front door can't happen because 1% are gonna lay a trap? So stash your shit before you FT, you should be doing that anyway.
---
I think they need to rethink how the CAMPS load into the game before they can do this.  All it would take is one good troll to build their base overlooking a long fall and then place the fast travel mat so that when they spawn, since the floor hasn't spawned in yet, they will drop to the ground.  
---
You can just sit there then and watch, laugh, and potentially pick up any junk that the person drops when they die from falling a height.
---
Could be.  It might have been a different challenge.  I know there was one I had picked up but it didn't appear as found for the Atom challenge.  Somebody said (or I read) to load it into the pip boy, so I did, then it cleared on the challenge.
---
You're preaching to the choir. Especially in the uranium fever event. I will switch to my bloodied 10mm sub and even go so far as to use the follow me emote if I get to the legendary first and lure it out to everyone else.
---
Yeah but that has nothing to do with it being powered or not. Your machines do not need to be powered for people to be able to buy from them. Power ONLY puts your camp on the map.
---
They were talking about the thing where some challenges give you items (so you have to buy more atoms)
---
Hopped on fallout for first time in weeks. Saw the daily challengers were ridiculous. Logged off.
---
No probs, I'm usually on for a few hours most days.
---
&gt;Factually not true. As I stated, pay2win incentivises Bethesda to make a sub-optimal game and you reward them for this. 
---
No, the simple fact is that Bethesda either makes a profit or the game goes away. I'd rather it didn't.  This is not a government handout, it's a business,  it either sustains itself or dies. THAT is factually true. 
---
&gt;You and I both know that this game isn't mechanically the same for those that pay for Fallout 1st and utility items than those who don't.
---
Good thing it's not a competitive game then, eh? My gameplay has no bearing on yours...ir to put it another way,  my game experiences are mine and yours are yours, they do not intersect.  
---
&gt;Now that's separate to whether or not you should feel bad about spending money for these advantages. 
---
Feel bad??? LMAO! I dont feel bad in the least, quite the opposite,  I feel quite good carrying you all along for free...but that's just me, I'm very giving. 
---
&gt;You can use weasel words to say it's pay2convenience or diminish the magnitude of the advantage. 
---
Um, ok. I don't recall using any such "weasel words" ... Rather rude to imply that I did.  I don't think it's any advantage because my gameplay doesn't affect you at all...except that by me and others buying the sub the game will continue to get updates, content and the servers will stay running. 
---
You're welcome!
---
The world is round, but Bethesda is located on the East coast of the US - so it hasn't hit the 24th yet where they are located... which \*May\* be the contributing factor.
---
The people that would be abusing it are already 'abusing' the general spawn when you travel to their camp because they found out how you can calculate where the game will spawn visitors
---
interesting. i have not experienced this but good to know.
---
&gt;My god. It's been a while since I've seen someone so proud of their own ignorance.
---
Lmao. Really, in what way? I assume you can make a post with content and not just inane insults?
---
Well deserved for buying this dumpster fire
---
At 4:30pm local time, roughly the same time as when I first became a member.
---
What level are you
---
Might make my 8th character. Gor bored of the others. Add me and we will meet at the mall strip
---
That's why I was mostly living in my PA, travel to a camp and be greeted with a spike trap in your face or simply spawn on a cliff beneath the camp and fall to your death....
---
Or don't be a dick? WHOA.
---
Yea I just play with someone the other day and he was just telling me that junkie it's good and blah blah but I feel bloodied it's good and as you said, dying means nothing but dropping your loot.
---
&gt;Namely that pay2win is about someone paying for ANY gameplay advantage that non-players do not get. 
---
So, wait, I have a high end gaming rig, is that pay to win? I mean, I certainly paid a lot for it and as I have super fast connections with super big, hi-res monitors with very wide viewing, it would seem that by your definition that was pay to win before I ever played?  Or you can take the other view that my rig doesn't affect you or your gameplay at all...just like my subscription.  Also, as my subscription is helping to keep the lights on and doors open, as it were, for FO76, I think the case could be made that I'm paying for you to win?
---
There's a lot of stuff I only want to do on group servers. I pretty much only go to my private server if I'm looking for a specific thing somewhere and it's not in a public one. I like to build CAMPs on a private server, too. That way people aren't wandering through while you're trying to place stuff.
---
And downvoted right away. Wtf it's a question with the intend of maybe uncovering a bug. Bettering the game.
---
The majority of my friends hate PvP and so it makes sense our different groups would prefer the servers for different reasons.
---
ok responder, your gonna get a lotta people killed lying to them . All I do is PvP hell, I logged most of my time in survival. That's how it works my dude, but believe what you want. . Assasin Sentinel in top level PvP just means you die in 2-3 shots .
---
Lol.
---
That’s like me and Minecraft.  I o my played it on the mobile version too.
---
I played minecraft and built a castle and village.
---
Then I built an automated mine and automated farms.
---
Then I built an automated flying machine that sort of worked.
---
Then I deleted the game because there was nothing to do and the thought of it made me sick.
---
Yet people spend years building things and then do it all again.
---
Maybe I’m just not the creative type (hint; I’m not) but after I’ve built what I wanted I couldn’t be bothered doing it all again.
---
The build system in fo4 and fo76 sucks me in though.  Much more than minecraft ever did.
---
We had it during beta, wonder why it was removed?
---
it doesn't work in sneak. crock and rest it with your goon friends.
---
This happens a lot it’s not uncommon.
---
You can buy one from the Watoga vendor, or try your luck with the Patrol Duty event. That event always drops a weapon plan, so you have a chance of getting it from there too
---
That's how the mind of a PvPer works, but not everyone is that way. When I take a workshop, it's because I want to do something with the workshop. I never want to PvP. Which is why I never take public server workshops anymore. I used to really enjoy building them up, and then leaving the server, so whoever found it next could enjoy what I built. Now that it's the only PvP, it's too dangerous and I have zero inclination to be head shot with no notice so a PvPer can get what, 50 caps? I can make 15K in a day through my Vendor, so 50 caps just to be a dick seems like it's really just an excuse to be a dick.
---
&gt;the definition of pay2win is important for the gaming culture and can't be simplified. 
---
Well see, right there is the problem! I don't really care about "the gaming culture" I care about my time, enjoyment and stress relief I get from playing games...in other words, you do you and I'll take care of myself.
---
Try to string multiple mods together without unpacking all of them and repackaging them as a single mod.
---
Creation (and its predecessors) use a very basic database structure that allows you to string multiple plugins together without having to work all that out beforehand.  
---
Mod A loads before mod B therefore anything that mod A and B changes - mod B's changes win by default.  Its a simple utility structure that Unreal doesn't do.
---
&gt;If you have a more authoritative source for a definition, please show us.
---
Is that the imperial Us or the collective us? Because definitions matter.
---
put your money where your mouth is. I challenge you to a 1 v 1 . winner posts a video link. I can promise you that I'll change your mind and my character will destroy yours regardless of what your wearing. You can be attacker or defender. Come back your claim that sneak and SA work together.
---
Bad RNG/luck. I've seen it 3x now in a private server over the course of 12h. See it fairly regularly in public servers as well.
---
Lode Baring on the other hand...
---
Like I said, if I was the only one, yeah one shot, but if someone else was around why just make the other person have a bad time?
---
Triple word
---
I'm checking some of my other subscriptions and I'm not really seeing it.
---
If I did that in my own small business, I'd be sued fast as hell.
---
Junkies if you also use power armor, or just don't want to die in one hit.
---
No no you wouldnt
---
&gt;have a friend who earns a low wage but basically owns everything in the atomic shop ..
---
So, wait, it's Bethesda's fault that your "friend " has no self control??? Good god, I hope you keep him away from infomercials!
---
So what you are saying is that if I deducted money from my client's bank account 2 days earlier than originally agreed upon that nothing would happen to me?
---
Even if it's not illegal for some reason then it's scummy as hell.
---
bad rng, its one of the public events so there is no trigger to it.  its also not a bug, id hit the search bar to look up how public events work.
---
as far as your other comment, there are bots that just downvote everything, you get used to it
---
Seriously how deluded are you. That's hellfire, it legit shouldn't even exist at this point of time
---
You know what really grinds my gears?
---
This game is still broken after a year.
---
Did it say it was gonna remove the money the day of cuz I don’t remember seeing anything on it so that means you didn’t agree to it that day then you agreed to pay them for it that’s it.
---
Not it is not common. I've handled all kinds of reoccuring charges from all kinds of different company backgrounds. It's only common for ach transactions to post before the weekend or literally one business day afterwards if it lands on a weekend. 
---
Debit remittances that are pre authorised can land on weekends. You don't see your phone or utility bill on reoccuring payment systems charge days early. Even my membership to a range does it the day of.
---
They did that to sneak money out before people cancelled knowing people would be waiting last moment to cancel
---
&gt; It's only criminal behavior because it was the easiest way for police to target poor people and people of color. 
---
Lmao. You're obviously to young to remember the crack wars. Perhaps you should read up on it a bit.
---
If he broke the contractual agreement then yes he would.
---
Jeez, Beth. When will you fix the game in general?
---
Or you could not be charged on your one month date, and still have your access.
---
Yeah if you broke the agreement but if he agreed to charge 2 days before no he wouldn’t
---
I really hope that within wastelanders their will be box enemies that u can hunt for and that try to evade and resist capture/termination

---
Much appreciated!
---
I made it to 130 mashing a button on a grenade bouquet while watching the first season of Designated Survivor on Netflix but YMMV. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
They charged me and gave me access same day when I first signed up. It's normally not any different with other subscription services that I've used.
---
Ooo look at all that SALT! I love it :) Can you show me on this doll where they touched you? Asking for a friend...
---
Didn't say anything about sneaking or stealth boys now did I? Go put words in someone else's mouth, you angry little tike you.
---
Both are great. I've used both and after 650 levels I prefer Junkies. 
---
The benefits of Bloodied are that it saves you from needing to use a lot of damage perk cards and you get a massive special bonus from an Unyielding set. Those are about the only major benefits unless you plan on soloing SBQ often. Even then, Junkies could potentially be better if you die a lot with Bloodied.
---
Junkie rifles on the other hand are more than strong enough to one-shot most common infantry. A J/E Lever or Railway can one shot a lv68 super mutant without sneaking. A [JE Auto Railway can take out a Behemoth almost instantly](https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/27c8896d-3417-4482-95f7-20c04aee6443) with headshots without sneaking.
---
So on top of killing pretty much anything instantly, you can tank anything too. For the armor, most will say to run Vanguard but damage resistance it *extremely overrated*. One piece of specific NPC resistant armor(Zealot's, Hunter's, ect) will negated more damage from that specific enemy than a full set of Vanguard will. I personally run a full set of AP/Sent with mixed NPC resistant armors and never have to stim.

AP armor any day. Frees up 3 points of action boy for other things like adrenaline.
---
Strawman aside, that's the problem. It's so frequently asked as to why they were charged early that they needed a separate FAQ page.
---
It was very clearly hidden or put in some sort of fine print, if it was put in at all.
---
This happened to me. A second ticket caused them to review and fix it in less than a day.
---
&gt; I don't get why anyone runs a junkies build
---
because its a decent alternative and not everyone min/maxes?  it is also way less to maintain.
---
 on a personal level it lets me work on solar vanguard so i can use perkpoints in other non-survival related perks.
---
Don’t mess with the rangers
---
It also depends on how much you have. If I remember correctly, it's your carry weight plus 1500 before you have to start destroying stuff
---
Thank you very much but now I have to ask.
---
&gt; as far as your other comment, there are bots that just downvote everything, you get used to it
---
Why?
---
Thanks for the info. I did not know that.
---
that i honestly dont have an answer for, probably made by someone in the hate bandwagon that to much time on their hands
---
The point is simple. I'm not going to argue with someone who doesn't have any legal or business background but its bad business practice to charge early on a month to month agreement which forcibly makes the consumer go again for another month. The terms and conditions that are defined on Bethesda's website clearly indicates that a change to billing protocol is mandated to have a 35 day notice of advance usually in the form of an email. Automatically committing people for another month is a breach of consumer rights. You don't charge early and the cancellation of Fallout 1st doesn't have a legal time frame when to cancel before being charged on their terms of service for this subscription. They can only be persuaded at this point not to charge early and let people decide when to cancel during that month. If they have a 3 day window to cancel before the end of the month, then its justified. Otherwise, no. And no there is no 35 day notice in advance since Fallout 1st isn't even out for 35 days.
---
200 IQ
---
That sadly does sound plausible.
---
Did you pay for another month?
---
Now that's super wierd.
---
I wonder why there's a discrepancy between the billing.
---
I hope you do lie, sneed.
---
I mean, different strokes for different folks...the carry weight costs alone make anything but bloodied untenable for me.
---
I'm wondering that myself, I even double checked my subscription status.
---
I'll look again in the morning.
---
Honestly I do the whole thing in sneak and destroy them manually. I can almost always get them to 100% destroyed without any robots even seeing I'm there.
---
This bug is about to fast travel my character into another game. Please fix it already.
---
True. But it does worry me that the majority will be dealing with dead npcs and real npcs are just quest givers not full characters. I'll be patient but mock my words I'll definitely quit.
---
B O A T F L I E S
---
This was exactly what two people that I know were going to do but they didn't realize that they were charged early.
---
Now that they money is out of their accounts, they're pretty much at the mercy of Bethesda.
---
Then I have the best rng cause all I've ever gotten is Cave crickets
---
Still waiting to hear back on my scrap loss ticket from last week. Provided proof I purchased on 10/23 as well, nothing.
---
Hahaha!
---
I wasted thousands of screws and haven't gotten the Radium suppressor yet. I'm about to make another attempt. The most elusive mod of all for me so far :)
---
Rarely use my private world. It just isn't as fun.
---
I agree fully with yout.
---
It's incredibly obvious that the person has zero business experience.
---
If someone tried this with real people, they'd lose customers / clients FAST.
---
Wow! Your screenshots are really nice! I do a lot of photography in this game as well, always taking a nice photo here and there whenever I can
---
&gt;Willing to pay cash money
---
We...We don't do that here
---
I hope you get your ATOMs too
---
I've had the money out of my account for days and I've yet to get them.
---
I had that happen last night too. Jumping servers helped

---
Thanks, and we shall see.
---
Is there a best event to grind Or just random
---
If you run through Whitesprings and kill all the sentry bots (6 or 7 possible) and the ghouls in the golf club you can get over 5k exp each time you hop servers
---
Mine always starts when heading to V9.  Sometimes it triggers when interacting with a freshly killed SB (harvest option when looting).
---
From the looks of it, unless they change the number of days in a month, this a bit on the "false advertisement" range. They said [one month](https://i.imgur.com/uuwW2vE.png) not 28 days.
---
I have to admit, i "didn't" found Abandoned Bog Town and Berkley, despite other challenge claimed me to have all 20 workshops being claimed atleast once. Either i've missed these locations somehow, or game is trying to fool me.
---
if possible I would appreciate so likes or karma, not sure how reddit works yet, but im trying to create a different community and provide much feedback to make the game more immersive and fun
---
When i tried to settle just across the river from Dyer Chemicals, my camp kindly put my FT point under water. You know, for getting Parasites when you aren't loaded yet.
---
same boat....  
---
Got the email 4 days ago
---
They said "[one month](https://i.imgur.com/uuwW2vE.png)" not 28 days
---
K buddy. Read the part where I said if you know a link where I can get one.
---
That was me I run a sneak vats riflemen build with a 1* bloodied handmade and 5 unyielding Bos combat armor pieces.
---
Check out this website https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
It allows you to play around with the perk card system and plan for the build you want. They added in the mutations recently as well
---
Lol Yupp .someone takes a workshop ,i see it as a challenge.it clearly says "PvP"can be started when you own one.and I dont do it to be a dick.just for the PvP.and I used to try to help people defend but they are always so scared and just delete all their stuff and leave server.so now I sneak up on them and take what I want .not my fault they cant read the warning before taking a workshop.and yea you got outplayed. Simple as that.now you know .
---
Notice how any comment on Reddit about fallout
---
76 about PvP gets downvoted.unless they are talking down on it.I should have posted.if private Servers were free .PvP would be dead.
---
I’ve made and scrapped hundreds of Radiums, still have one last mod locked, i don’t even know what it is lol, maybe a reflex sight or something 🤮
---
Picked up some nuclear keycards today without having to chase that stupid cargo not. Felt pretty good
---
yes because bulk 5mm can be bulked by 50 or 100 as well as 50 cal can be bulked the same... say 100 rounds for 50 CAL can bulk sell for 25 caps now its viewed as buy one for one get three free.. much more reasonable indeed, but it should require a work station to unbulk if it reduces weight. this added would prevent someone hording 1,000,000 rounds for their quad ammo minigun
---
Sorry bud you missed the opportunity to farm karma by about a month
---
My inventory is haunted by the supply drop tapes
---
Wrong.  Trouble shooters is
---
This. I do not run a bloodied build, so I keep a switch on mine for those that do
---
I don't do it for the caps.Ive been trading since beta and have any PvP weapon I need .I do it for the simple fact that I can.its part of the game.and ill keep takimg workshops so they know it aint all rainbows and roses out here in the wasteland.
---
BGS will eventually nerf bloodied somehow. Either perks that eliminate damage at low health or simply reduce the outrageous buff bloodied gives you. They nerfed shotguns, vampire weapons, two shot, etc... Just a matter of time.
---
Bloatflies love the resort by the gisnt green bridge.
---
I had this too, I just gave up tbh
---
It happens if you go near Morgantown airport or any random air drops found on the map.
---
I was just looking at this. I’ve caught sludge lung. Give me my 80.
---
I dunno about you but I'm starting to care less about the Nuka-Fridge and more about that Gingerbread furniture
---
Usually 1c per round for all... give away arrows and harpoon for free... bit is 10c per mini nuke too much?
---
Most bills charge you before you're late, that's the whole point of auto-payments.
---
The majority of vendors at people camps have horrible stuff .when they hsve something good its marked up way more than its worth.you waste more caps fast traveling to people camps then actually buying stuff.so no,vendors are not that big a deal.and yea I have several friends who have private servers and can just jump servers.they farm queens all the time and its lucrative the way they do it.but they are pve builds.I don't knoe how they do it and in not gonna act like I do.like pve players when they talk about pvp.
---
I'm surprised there's only 2 christmas rewards.. the rest is all in game stuff.. maybe they'll add more? 
---
It just seems a little lazy again to not add new rewards, I do know that there will be gift giving so maybe that'll be some new items in that
---
Food builds always kill the last enemy even if its legendary. That happened to me once so now I one shot everything.
---
lol no one has "out played" anyone. Forcing everyone else to not do something because YOU find joy in being a dick, doesn't mean you're a better gamer. It just means you're a dick.
---
Just got my refund of 1300 atoms for this exact reason; they let me keep the bundle as well.
---
I'm saying not everyone is a dick. Clearly you do it because you can, because non-dicks don't. Duh.
---
My route for xp is Whitesprings, Westek and Harpers Ferry.  Mob spawns are consistent and once you know your path through its fast.  Only loot legendaries so you don't spend time with inventory management, you can quickly scrip or store them at the train station while in Whitesprings.  
---
Fissure farming i dont find as fast or as enjoyable.  Hoping frequently to empty sites or running between sites doesn't feel efficient even if it is and i generally go through more ammo killing scorched beasts but that could just be down to my build.
---
You're right. On the billing date. Not several days before the billing date. On the billing date. They also usually provide the service when they do. In this case, they didn't provide the ATOMs.
---
Going beyond that, they didn't state that they billing cycle is less than a month. They stated it [as a month](https://i.imgur.com/uuwW2vE.png). They mislead enough people that they needed a whole FAQ page over it.
---
My opinion looking deeper into it is that the whole thing appears to to be a scummy way to stop people from canceling their subscriptions last-minute.
---
Yes. The fee you paid was for one month. Just because it charged you two days before that first month was up for the second month does not mean you arent receiving a full month of service. If you were to cancel your next payment before it renews and your 1st membership ended days before the month was over then itd be false advertising. My phone bills autopay takes the money out a day in advance as well.
---
Forcing ?do the PvP is suddenly having control over the Food build and making him fight .?nope.its in game mechanics.since he doesn't PvP he don't know about those little tricks .and Yupp call me a dick for playing the game as intended.
---
Save the turtles!
---
Legit got outplayed.nothing to do with exploiting or being a dick.
---
If you want to see people that actually want to do PvP, you'd do Hunter/Hunted. Otherwise you're preying on people that just want a workshop.
---
Mine doesn't. It's on the same day. It's the same with Netflix, Battlenet, and the like. It's bad customer service to remove the money from an account early.
---
If I did that as a small business owner then I'd be losing clients and customers FAST.
---
If you don't want a subscription to something, you should stop it way before it's due again.
---
Nope.  I’m on public severs the vast majority of the time so that I can buy and sell.
---
That'd be a neat trick if I wasn't tricked into thinking a billing cycle is something that it's not.
---
Small businesses have no relevance in this situation. Its in the terms that they can charge you before the renewal date.
---
What a great idea. Tell your wife some random guy on the internet thinks she's brilliant.
---
My renewal came through yesterday and I haven't received anything yet.  
---
I figure it'll either show up around the usual morning "update" time when the dailies flip, or I'll send'em an email on Monday.
---
I have this too. It's broken 😢
---
Same here. Private servers are great for a few things but get old really fast without friends to play with.
---
You get it from the enclave quest line
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
This shits getting old, I died while a sbq was on her last leg, and it wouldn't let me respawn, I just laid there on the ground spinning in circles while everybody got to enjoy the loot. I kept hitting x to respawn for 10 minutes before I gave up, bitch owes me 1000 5.56 rounds.
---
I’m a bloodied build, but I’ll just run at full health in situations when it’s necessary and use my VE Gatling Plasma.  It’s not that big of a deal.
---
Lol thats one of the hardest plans to get but you can get it from any event in the forest. Maybe its a reward from dailies too but im pretty sire just events.
---
If you do the excavator quest at Garahan mining, and build an excavator and scan it you get the plan for the workbench free.
---
This is funny, as I've been seeing so many Lode Baring ones lately.
---
You got my upvotes! 👍🏼
---
Nope, I'm on PC.
---
Time to grind
---
At this pace I guess soon we'll be getting hard time while even trying to launch the game...
---
That's incorrect according to the terms of service agreed upon: https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service
---
I can stay in the hunter hunted radio for hours and I still wont have enough to start the event.you don't know know anything about PvP or how it works.stop trying to talk about something you have no knowledge of.
---
I'm indeed just going to ignore these in the future as well.
---
Hahaha, dude. You just admitted no one wants to PvP.  I've got over 1200 hours in game, I know what I'm talking about.
---
I got charged today, but never received my Atoms. Hoping I'll get them tomorrow.
---
Eeeemerrrgency Induction port!
---
I thought they fixed that issue months ago.
---
Clearly you did not read my post
---
I'm usually in a hurry... Haha
---
 "Your Membership will automatically renew on the expiration date of the then-current Membership term or rolling period at a fee no greater than Bethesda's then-current price at the time of renewal, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless You cancel Your Membership.

---
I stand corrected. Microsoft does however have in their terms that they may charge you two days in advance for subscriptions. So, while charging early is not unheard of, Bethesda definitely didnt put it in their terms.
---
Some ammo types never sell but I still hang on to them.
---
5.56 always sells, I just make a lot using ammo smith and super duper.
---
.308 sells slower.
---
40mm grenades finally sold yesterday.
---
Shotgun shells sell too.
---
Mini nukes rarely and missiles I can’t give away
---
Yea, I'll do them if I can but its a piss take really when the even won't spawn.
---
It's apparently in the list of datamined rewards for the upcoming Christmas event. You're probably best off waiting until then to get one as they're normally pretty rare.
---
I can’t bring myself to buy ammo unless I’m completely out lol.
---
I don’t have a backup weapon for tagging on my pistol build so I just try and be the last shot.
---
As I said, I played close to 8h. That really can't be normal. I'm almost certain it's a bug. Despite the other comments with all respect.
---
Yeah, I just recently learned which doors and terminals to hack to make it quicker. And that if you don't kill the stuff at the beginning, less robots load at the end, so I normally end up with just 1 or 2 robots at the end. Takes me about 20 minutes.
---
Speed run, ignoring robots as much as possible, hacking one terminal and picking one door, you can do it in just under 13 mins.
---
And a lot of stims!
---
You're thinking of colonel
---
Thanks good to know
---
Yeah, something is up with this whole thing. Even if this thread doesn't get much further than this... I feel that this whole thing is, at a minimum, immoral. 
---
It's another brick in a wall of "problematic" things Bethesda has done since Fallout 76.
---
It’s Sunday here in Australia, wouldn’t this be more due to the weekend?
---
No, these icons are not 1st. The scorchbeast one was given as part of the event where the community had to take down x amount of scorchbeasts. Pretty sure the honeybeast was around that time too.
---
I have a Bloody commando character and a Junkies heavy weapons.  Enjoy both builds and alternate.
---
Don’t want to repeat what was said on other posts.  A couple additional considerations:
---
- Bloody builds enjoy additional +25-30% XP due to increased INT
---
- Since you’re not in combat all the time, with Junkies build the negative effects can be easily negated by taking the chems.  Tying the chems to the wheel, it’s as easy as 1-2-3-4-5.  It also gives the significant chem bonuses and you no longer care about becoming addicted.
---
I put 2k 10mm in my vendor at 1 cap per and it just sat there for a month but someone bought it the other day. Doesn’t cost me anything but minuscule weight. Makes me wish I’d put more in, but I leave the excess at the Overseer’s Camp.
---
Huh, good to see Enclave marches onward!
---
WH!AAAAAA
---
But I have 4 possum badges so I replaced it with leather worker, backpacker,  photographer, and chem
---
Depends on your level and build.
---
Best way was the double experience event we just had lol. 
---
Always eat and consume experience increasing consumables (mama dolces stew, etc).
---
If you’re low level then my best way was always to go to whitesprings, stir up the ghouls in the golf club then go and run to the wall and hide there and pick them off.  (They usually run out of sight when they realise they can’t get to you so you have to jump down to lure them back).
---
If you are higher level and can handle more than that then fissure hip and kill the scorchbeasts as they spawn then all the scorched that spawn in support.
---
I run bloody, though, so I normally end up dying at least once, that adds a bit of time. :p
---
Brutus (the caged dog) at the Freak Show typically has one
---
Is your friend running the mod that changes the colour of the quest markers etc?
---
Been hitting the nukashine pretty hard, have you?
---
The lowest of efforts.
---
Hey, my food build is unarmed, I can't help but do 9k to it
---
I meant that I have the same problem, it won't complete. I have done all of them except 3 or 4 i think.
---
Poison resist over rad resist imo
---
Yes, I think so.  The one that makes their markers a different color than their team mates.
---
 Yes, I think so. The one that makes their markers a different color than their team mates.
---
I'd prefer it.
---
Good idea.
---
If you equip and are holding the camera when you sit down you should be able to emote. It won't do the animation, but it should show the picture above your head.
---
Unless they fixed it, but I doubt it.
---
I’ve had a few logins around Lewisburg where supurmutant hordes and the obligatory *** Legendary with them. I saw a Legendary Diseased Glowing Supermutant Something, but he despawned.
---
&gt;Fair
---
Oh hey, the core problem with fo76.
---
Your kind ruined a fantastic game with your whining.
---
Your opinion is cancer.
---
I like junkies, go commando (with or without underwear), vanguard armor and some junkies auto rifles. You can have psycho(tats) and a booze buff up **or** fury and a booze buff if you go melee. I have a junkies meathook that fucks butts, do about 9k power attack with 1 rank in the gladiators and 3 iron fist. 
---
Bloodied range (stealth riflemang) is fun, too. Junkies isn't real perk intensive, though, so you can just try it out... If it's not your thing, you suck on an addictol and try Bloodied, I guess.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
In my opinion One gun army is useful perk
---
Good build - well balanced.
---
- You may want to experiment with “Rejuvenated”.  It provides extra HP and AP.  
---
- Bear Arms / Batteries Included:  Depends on your build...  Selecting Batteries Included it seems you lean towards energy weapons.  In that case the arsenal is narrower  you may not need Bear Arms.
---
No, both icons were given free to the entire community to claim during the Project Clean Appalachia event. They hsve nothing to do with Fallout 1st.
---
When this happens to me I hold down the button to put my gun up and then it will fix itself.
---
I have the same problem and with my artillery signal grenades too
---
Same, coming out of the Vault was okay... But then getting to the first quest marker and up to the 3rd which I think was a little dilapidated town (which I think was white springs) started the rendering and FPS problems
---
I met 2 people to party with, but both had ps4 pros so I couldn't ask them about what they were experiencing
---
But they did say when they party up the FPS drops... And brought up more examples as multiple nukes make the game crash
---
My issue was walking in my 3 man party and continually stuttering and none of my shots registered until half a second later
---
The game is 20$ on psn store now but still, if you have fallout 4 you have this game
---
Final lesson learned:
---
Have good gaming rig so you could purchase fallout on a computer
---
My "gaming" is Asus ROG G56JK laptop Intel i7 4710 I think, Nvidia gtx 850 M (the M is a special laptop version that makes the graphic card weaker, and 12 gig ram) can handle games like Diablo 3 at 30-40fps on good settings and fallout new Vegas on 50-60 at okay graphics
---
So yeah the 850M gtx Nvidia performs at a 750 (regular no letter) gtx version. And it can barely run fallout 4 at 30 FPS very low graphics... 
---
**back to my poor ps4, can barely keep up with fallout 76 environments, bugs**
---
I have done that but it just keeps coming back up
---
I've been having the same issue for a while, but once I found 40 artillery grenades in my stash and I was able to use them, idk hope it gets fixed soon, I miss my big guns and vertibot
---
Yeah, my 4th character did this. It's a few extra shots, but definitely doable. Got a AAE25 handmade from perv last sale, Adrenaline Gun Fu'ing the shit out of everything heheheheheeeee
---
I get on average 3x the amount of legendaries in private than public. They don't spawn more, but 9/10 times I hit west tek or whitesprings in public, legendaries are all dead. Whereas 0/10 do I miss legendaries on my private. Same goes for Uranium fever. It's near impossible to get all 3 legendaries from Uranium Fever on public before some clown one shots them, but in private, I get all 3 every time. Private servers arent killing public servers, shitty players are killing public servers. I go for vendors, and then back to private. Between the randoms constantly trying to bash me to set off unstable isotope, legendary kill stealers, 50% chance of not getting your camp placed, massive lag and crashes, loot/bobbleheads/mags always gone - I vote private, everytime. If they ever implemented unlimited npc daily cap sales, this would turn into a single player game for me, an updated version of F04.
---
We know theyre shady. You guys who keep supporting their schemes, then act surprised about it are a strange lot..Beth wants their money and Beth gon get their money. Lol
---
thanks but dunno what ur talking about
---
Cant vendor in private. My friends who have it hardly use it.
---
To remove most of the issues around people building traps just implement some rules.
---
Must be placed on ground.
---
Must be a certain number of squares around trap objects.
---
I had the same thing the other day, although it was on the second of two nukes being dropped, I was actually getting the loot from her and a something cam up behind me and I died.  No big deal, except the game would not let me respawn.  I tried for quite a while. Nothing worked, I had to kill the game and I could not get back to the server.  It also has been crashing again during SBQ events.
---
I’d have to say the biggest rival is the “cheat engine” used by a lot of these posers...
---
Cheat engine?
---
Scour player venders for the 5 super rare and elusive fasnact masks
---
It’s rampant on PC, anyway.
---
Lol that’d take forever. But legit tho, what do i do?
---
You asked where to get it or if someone wanted to trade. I just answered your question fuck tard to save caps.
---
Yes, it will have a bunch of voiced lines, and this time in proper Chinese it seems, unlike the Liberators do.
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/648062189944569887/unknown.png
---
And no, it's not a modified Excavator PA, it has a completely scratch made meshes.
---
I've had a lot of luck with a (ballistic) Gatling gun with explosive ammo / prime reciever (around 200 DPS). A little slower than the other automatics, but it clears out the panels pretty fast. Just keep a troubleshooters legendary as a secondary to take care of the damn Edward Sciccorhand Assaultrons.
---
Bloody.
---
You can only have so much Armor piercing and the tank killer perk plus the right mods provides plenty.
---
So add bloody, stealth bonus damage, VATS critical damage, better criticals, and a secondary legendary effect of 50% more crit damage, mr sandman, and you’re looking at insane levels.  (Though not as much as a bloody black powder rifle from stealth...but that’s a one shot deal).
---
Lever action &gt; hunting rifle &gt; gauss.
---
Because gauss rifle shots need to be charged.
---
I guess it’s only a reasonable challenge for the normal creatures lol
---
Oh yeah, I heard about that.
---
Now I want Drinkin’ Buddy from fo4 in my camp
---
Yeah, I think that I'm very done now. I was hoping that they'd be more moral than Blizzard. I hadn't played since December 2018 and thought Fallout 1st was a good jumping back on point.
---
Nope!
---
If you looked it up before asking you would know tons of people have asked the same question. But to answer leave your private world and join back right away and everything will be back alive and normal :). Its a bug.
---
If you are junkies build (no such build exist so i assume you have addictions) then you use junkie's weapon
---
Like i said i already do this  ut the golf course stays a dead spawn
---
It doesn't matter the day of the week for online transactions in this manner. Plus it went through on Thursday the 21st when the ToS says that it should have went through on the 23rd.
---
Ya idk whoops.
---
It sucks so i hoped somebody has the same problem and knows how to solve it.
---
I relog 1 or 2 times everytime i nuke there so there are spawns but the golf course is always full of dead ghouls
---
Ease of modding does not mean it has the ability to do everything we currently do in a FO game, it just means its easy mod what it does.  Substantial difference.
---
Buying good Legendaries is possible as well for usually 5-6k. That is of course if you're a cap farmer, but getting that kind of change usually only takes a few hours or less even with some builds.
---
Wishful thinking from the haters.  See it over and over.
---
Just tried it on xbox, it works exactly as described
---
Beats a McDonald's straw
---
Make a new character a start over
---
TSE will offer you more in terms of raw damage. But with the accuracy penalty, I personally prefer AAE. Either way, if you’re running a .50 cal, you’ll want to prime it for the ammo yield &amp; extra damage. 
---
This is really handy:
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Well then my next question is how to farm that many caps. I only have 8000 and that is the most I have ever had.
---
We *got* exclusive sales or we are *getting* exclusive sales? I don't remember any exclusive sales for 1st last month, unless you are talking about the weird, green skinned, Ranger armor. That reskin seemed kind of lazily made, if I'm being honest, so if thats the exclusive sale we get, a quick color swap of existing gear, yikes.
---
Kill all the ghouls then go back to the whitespring train station then load back into the world that should work
---
I had that happen to me the other day (immediately after doing the morgantown airport event). Every time I fast traveled an airdrop crate would fall. Didn't realize until the 2nd travel it was following me (and not just coincidentally there). I've had scorchbeast bodies do that too.
---
I'm a rifleman build but have 8 heavy gunner in st and 3 stabilized I can swap out. I just did this for the first time a couple days ago cause I found a Furious +10% while aiming gatling plasma. 
---
I primed it and use it on the queen. I hit 40-50 per shot on the queen. 100-200 on scorched.
---
I'm a full health build and have started leaning toward Furious weapons for damage output. I dont use vats so the +10% while aiming perfect for me.
---
Compared to my Vampire gatling laser the gatling plasma hits a little more than 2x per shot.
---
One shotters is the reason I hate Uranium Fever. Fun event made bad by other players.
---
There's two spawn locations, one for you and one slightly next to it for other players.
---
I tend to test it with my mule account to make sure people travel in where i want.
---
That already happens 50% of the time someone builds at Seneca Rocks. I'll FT in, get tossed 200ft and hear the reassuring thunk of my power armor saving my butt.
---
I think it’s the grounded mutation that’s nerfing your damage, off the top of my head it’s -20% energy damage. Try switching out to a ballistic heavy or dropping the mutation.
---
Tonight I was playing with friends as well as a few recent nights, there's been a guy basically instakilling the Queen when she lands. Nobody gets loot and the guy that instakills her, always leaves the server shortly after.
---
I think you are confusing the Gatling Gun for the Gatling Laser. The Gatling Gun is pure Ballistic Dmg.
---
This. I've seen lots, and lots of posts from people either 1) paying just one most to try it and *might* do another month or 2) paying for one month with intent to get content and cancel subscription. They won't put out content before the time most people are renewing, they'll put it AFTER so if people cancelled, they have to sign up another month to get the newest content. A lot of businesses do this, even if it's not good. Expect to see content first week of Dec, close enough for people that paid to not riot for not getting something, but far enough away from people that could cancel.
---
I'd eat it:

You say you’re using a Gatling laser?
---
I never use my TSE anymore. It use to be my favorite but the damage isnt all that special and the gun breaks way to fast. I went from TSE to EE to Instigating to Furious. Furious is my favorite of the bunch.
---
I can 1 shot scorch beast with my Bloodied gauss
---
You can usually get around it by building additional adjacent foundations as well, or blueprinting stuff.
---
Some people have very hungry Light Machine Guns they wanna use!
---
No the Gatling Gun, the hand-crank one.
---
That's the double extractor lead+acid spot isn't it :D
---
Atom Shop isn't cannon. There's no need to justify it.
---
40mm Fernandez, yeah, fhat's my cousin
---
Don't play it but if you do go to Helvita then Summersville then go-to Morgantown it will make alot of sense in the long run. One big tip pick up everything besides bones those are useless and to save space make Bulk items in the tinkerer's workbench.
---
Walk the entire route, then fast travel to the closest location outside of the blast zone. Relog here, and everything should be alive and well
---
Yeah I will not have over loaded my inventory and I'm forced to go to 76 it is stupid
---
Seems to be a bug related to picking up an item that is idendical to your hotkey item, but a non legendary. Its happened to me twice this last week. First time, I picked up a generic lever action to scrap and it somehow replaced my Bloodied lever in hotkey menu. I had to drop the generic for my Bloodied to be visable in hotkey menu. Second time was an auto combat rifle, replaced my bloodied auto combat rifle in menu. Freaked me out till I realized its just a visual bug, my guns were all still in my inventory. Hope you didn't accidentally drop your legendaries instead of the crap guns.
---
I already have a " spam E" macro for looting really fast, works just as well on the mainframe cores. I just strafe my cursor over them and they pop.
---
Don't click too fast though, I've been disconnected when i used a 50ms delay which is default in Logitech software, probably as a DoS precausion.
---
Careful.  With the level of spazz on this sub, I wouldn’t be surprised to find a bunch of flat earthers.
---
Canon or not, this is simply a post for discussing it on grounds of immersion. Frankly, no matter that the comments here say it’s in the game as an unexplained item in the AS. This is solely for people to brainstorm and maybe have some fun coming up with theories.
---
Just a hypothesis do you have your turrets in a cluster?
---
Wouldn't you be a bit of a muppet if you didn't? :P
---
I hate that space station. If they had even done the most basic research on wheel type stations, the walkways would be on the right surfaces.
---
I had the same experience but at Poseidon. I left and returned and it rectified itself. Bit bizzare though.
---
When your strange, no ones alive in this game 🎶🎶
---
Some registered when I picked them up and others I had to play to get them to register.
---
Wth are you talking about?
---
I sell all ammo types for one cap each. And it sells though.  I noticed by  placing  my  camp closer to the forest you sell more ammo (even 10mm and .32mm) even junk items sell better, Aslong you keep you prices fair though. My bulk junk doesnt goes above 30caps, besides the ballistic fiber and stable flux  because its not so easy to find.
---
Maybe the people at Mama Dolces were able to acquire some power armor from spies they had in The United States government or The Garrahan Mining Company Co. and they just modified it.
---
No. They are spaced out.
---
Rarely? They have referenced New Vegas lore in every game made since New Vegas, so... it is extremely common?
---
I figured because mine are in a group and I'm having the same issue so I thought they might be hitting each other and the turrets perceived it as a threat
---
they can make stealth suits but not retrofit power armor. Thinking too hard about it.
---
I've not seen one at Scorched Earth in ages.....I've got about 12 of them in my stash though from previous fights....it was one mob I always looked for....just to get that dog helmet as a trophy.
---
Its happening to me almost every death
---
That'd be great, I really would love that!
---
It's easy if you have vending machines and sell any unwanted ammo and junk and the most popular aid items for sensible prices. I do do a lot of junk farming though. What sells well: bulked steel at 25 caps (use Scrapper constantly), and ballistic fiber, aluminium, lead, gears, springs, screws, waste acid, circuits, copper, plastic, all ammo at 1 cap, except plasma cores for 35 and fusion cores for 45. What not to bother selling at all: glass, cork, bone, ceramic, rubber, wood, missiles, mini nukes. And I do runs for them then sell magazines and Bobbleheads for 100 caps. Or you could set up a water farm and sell that to robot vendors with Hard Bargain equipped. I also sell extra cooked meat to robots as I always have too much. Sell any trash legendaries (ie most that drop) for a good price too as people will buy them, but only for scrip. I price 1* at 75-100 cap. 2* at around 200. Most plans just sit there so sell those dirt cheap or not at all, and be mindful of the ones people will pay more for, but don't price them sky high. Yesterday I played day and night and made about 20,000 caps from my machines.
---
I got this from the Purveyor a few months ago, I never use it
---
If the player finds the plan, let’s say in Mama dolce and produce them by himself as a vault76 dweller cause he is a lausy commie, then it would be okay, right?
---
Well they actually salvaged some PA from US, just like how US salvaged Heigui suits and created the stealth boy, it's probable China developed a version of their own.
---
Still I'd want to say Atom shop isn't canon or you'd have to explain those Liberty Prime PAs.
---
Well AAE/FE for automatic weapons , IE for non automatic weapons. FE should out perform AAE in boss fights, assuming you use rank 3 Stabilized.
---
Carefull they will see this and goo mmm ammo for atoms
---
It's hard to tell if it is truly "input lag" or game hiccups FPS... My internet says it's between 100mbs-250mbs, direct connection, no one else on it... 
---
But joining a party made the game go haywire
---
And also my shots registered like a second after
---
Structures disappeared, edges glowed
---
I think the first town following the quests was white springs and the presence of enemies caused extreme stutter but soon as I looked away from the enemies or looked at the ground my FPS became normal again
---
I like that idea of getting the blueprints for a PA frame not from the US govt but from a corporation, which would have much more lax security. Nuka Cola, Abraxo, Vim!, (and Garrahan like you mentioned) all had multiple power armor suits of various makes and models, and that’s just the companies I get off the top of my head. It would be really easy for the one nation that has got essentially *the invisi-suit* at its disposal to snatch at least one suit or suit blueprint.
---
There is a crashed witch?
---
We ran the raid for 3 hours. With blue screens sharing between the team reach run. 11 minute at the Midway point on one run. Just terrible. So frustrating
---
Same thing with scorchbeasts. But on the plus side is you're overencumbered just plop some stuff in it fast travel to a stash box and ta-da you've got yourself an unreliable pack mule.
---
You are not answering the question.
---
Agreed. I want to keep 1. bug parts for backpack mods 2. Assaultron circuit boards to manufacture new sentry bot helmets when I accidentally srcap the one I'm wearing in inventory... other stuff as they become important.
---
make it like the favorite marker but with another button combo.
---
Why did you try to wear it, you are no dog.
---
I have new Vegas on PC (the steam version doesn't work BTW, I paid for a version that doesn't work and had to use the pirated version to play a game I paid for lol)
---
I never  never had a ps3
---
Went from ps2 to PC to ps4
---
What you are describing is typical Bethesda game bugs that fails when the game gets "too big" 
---
In this post I am referring to ps4 first Gen regular size, failing to perform fallout 76, even in whitesprings...beginner area 
---
My internet connection is between 100mbs and 250mbs, direct ethernet line, no one else on my bandwidth and all these problems can't easily be called lag 
---
The only other explanation, by Todd trying to make "16x the detail" 
---
**It ended up, "it just (doesn't) work"**
---
I honestly believe they Bethesda intended fallout 76 to be on the Xbox one x, ps4 pro, and modern gaming rig.... I think they knew of the poor performance and threw caution to the wind
---
Your post says laser, check it.
---
Power armor needs fusion cores to run, China couldn’t make those, or have the ability to make them even if they understood them.
---
You can get badges from 2 daily's. Stings n things and the one at kiddie cabins. Also you can get them from campfire tales event
---
Should be home in about 5 hours. Have some stuff to take care of and then I'll be able to let you know for sure.
---
I never had it until the last patch. Now it happens a lot
---
My take on it that it is canon, but not by location. It is present within the atomic shop for the same reason why Maxsons battle coat was there: a convenient way for players to wear or equip their favourite items without the need to justify it by lore.
---
In Fallout: New Vegas, Veronica did mention that the US created the pulse gun for fears that the Chinese were developing their own power armour. Wether or not this confirms that this was just a hunch by US and they wanted to be prepared or that the Chinese were 100% developing their own PA as leaked by the US spy is yet to be known.
---
And although the Chinese were defeated and pushed out of Anchorage, it wouldn’t be entirely implausible that they did manage to either take down some power armour equipped soldiers. Which they then would have seized and taken back to China to be reverse engineered. Which would also solve their lack of compact fission technology.
---
So overall I do think it could be canon and that what we see in the atomic shop is what it was coming across as just as the bombs dropped. But, it is not canon by location.
---
I know but it's rare and time consuming
---
[Chinese Power Armor, which will soon be added to the Atom Shop in Fallout 76](https://imgur.com/7049n96)
---
Same
---
As a walking bullet sponge look for a Vampire's Gatling Gun. I'm getting 217 dmg/Shot with mine
---
IIRC, grounded has a negative effect on energy weapons.  Might be why that laser isn’t ring to well for you.
---
I’m a melee build, but generally use  a gatling on SBs.  Might be slow, but it gets the job done
---
Haha, that would be golden; the CPA being a literal fabrication by the Enclave.
---
That’s a good point. I don’t think an intelligence post would be properly outfitted to fully dissect a power armor suit, but they could definitely send valuable information back home to China to those who *could*. &gt;!And don’t forget the pulse gun’s lore from FNV either.!&lt;
---
Location north of Fort Defiance, if remember correctly.
---
Also got one not a long time ago at SBQ, at August or September.
---
Right now you can only display it at your CAMP or sell.
---
LVL 28
---
If you lost items in your scrap box Bethesda gave these out as compensation.
---
THIS
---
oooo, yeah i have the 650s too, they are awesome
---
Thanks I did loose some item but not as much
---
With the massive decrease in functionality between the Stealth Suit and the Stealth Boy, among other technological products of espionage from both sides.... I don’t trust the scientists in charge of reverse-engineering things in Fallout 😂. I wouldn’t expect much functionality from a Chinese copy of the T-45 (which is likely all they’d have access to unless they got really lucky and managed a T-51).
---
Pemmican is easy. Do the operation tidy daily event (spawns at kiddy Korner cabins). You get 1 pemmican as a guaranteed drop for a very easy event. 
---
S'mores recipe you get from the campfire tails event, again, easy event. S'mores themselves are a pain to craft but all the ingredients are easily found. I find whitesprings has several good areas for glowing resin in a short distance of each other.
---
But I thought Bethesda were "jealous of Obsidians success" and would never reference New Vegas ever again! /s 
---
It's only a couple of months away, I really shouldn't be following the spoilers for Wastelanders but damn it all I am very interested in this story.
---
No surprise that this bug is back, it’s just sad at this point with how many bugs they re-introduce...
---
I miss when if you emoted with the camera out you were launched across the map
---
Yes, a lot..
---
Fine a comfy chair and wait for Wastelanders to come out, assuming you stopped playing after the Wild Appalacia DLC was done, if not, go to the train stations and read the posters and notes on the walls
---
It's either a Chinese prototype built on a salvaged American power armor frame, or it's a US military training toy for opposing force exercises. Masking equipment to look like it belongs to the enemy for training purposes is pretty common.
---
I'm guessing the guys in Mama Dolces "acquired" one after the shipment of Stealth Suits never turned up. It seems to be a reskin for the Excavator PA so I would presume they stole one from Hornwright / Garrahan (I honestly forget who built it) and repurposed it. I'd question the lore behind it if it was a reskin for the T-51 or X-01 as they're advanced military gear, but I could certainly envision the Communists stealing the mining suit as a cheap solution.
---
Couldn't you already do that with normal shells? It looks like a box
---
The whole right side of my screen is just letters. Not even all of them can be out at once side or main. It’d probably take me about a day or two of gaming just to get through all of those.
---
I found s'mores recipe from a player vendor, so check out those.
---
What is the point of this post? If you don't like FO1st  then feel free to play another game
---
Well if you hit a pipe hard enough, its gonna break on the weakest point again, if it was broken before, so yeah kind like that but with numbers from 0 to 1 !
---
no one really buys them. They have to be less then a vendor. I don't sell anything but weapon or armor and I price em all at 5 Caps.
---
thats what i hoped for.
---
You should be able to get around a 100 damage with the Gatling gun, make sure to have all 3 heavy gunner perk cards at max level, it's essential for this build. My build is also PA Heavy Gunner with the highest damage output I can get.
---
Well, maybe, but i did claimed ABT and Berkley Springs. Besides, i visited them many times, but achievement just can't complete.
---
I take it out then build a weapon mod it and give it to a random low level that's on the server alongside other goodies 
---
Gave a legal 26 a full set of level 25 Combat armour with Black Diamond and other stuff, just cause I wanted to and to scrip it would be a waste
---
'Wanna buy a charge card?'
---
Anti Armour should do just fine, assuming you have maximised the damage output through your perk cards.
---
There were large updates to Fallout 4 recently
---
NO
---
What I’m saying is that they reverse engineered power armour and compacted fission technology after Anchorage.
---
I’d like to think that the Chinese were able to reverse engineer and create their own power armour but ran out of time to do the same for fission technology as the Americans closed in on China. I’m no engineer but I’m assuming recreating power armour would be significantly easier and expedient than ya know SHRINKING an entire fission/fusion reactor to be more or less hand held.
---
And even, let’s say, the Chinese were able to recreate the compacted fission technology either during or after Anchorage and solved their energy crisis, I highly doubt the Americans would back down after having their territory invaded.
---
I get the impression it is easier to add and fix things in a single player than in multiplayer. Online games always have more of a predictable element to it.
---
Pretty sure you could build them at your base during beta but removed it due to some issue.
---
South of Aaronholt Homestead in the farm area (also has cranberries)
---
I’m having trouble on pc, not my end either.
---
Yep, watched one of mine systematically destroy 3 things before I stored, and replaced it. I keep all my turrets far apart, so it's not accidental friendly fire triggering it I don't think.
---
Players are sad
---
To further enhance the sense of immersion, eat something fart inducing, like a bowl of black beans, and wallow in the sulfur stench.
---
To be honest, i see no reason to renew your subscription. I got it once for the armor and the scrapbox but now i don't see why i would keep paying them.
---
Its an excellent tool for killing other players, it was removed so they could find a less exploitable way of implementing it but that never happened.
---
Well that’s the thing, the kind of reactors present in power armor ***are*** compact. The usual size - in the Fallout universe - is that of a vault generator. And, as an engineer, I can attest that upscaling is always easier than downscaling; making a small, durable, and portable reactor is much harder than a big clunky stationary one. So, China having power armor that runs off of fusion cores (or fusion core analogues) would mean they *had already solved* the fusion problem. So yeah, I think I have a remedy. Let’s say they figured out how to make the reactor, but couldn’t make the fusion cores. So they were only able to get the PA working with access to American fusion cores, which means they aren’t reliable enough for front lines combat like you suggested, but say, when fusion cores are readily available after the war, a PA operator based out of Mama Dolce’s shouldn’t have any trouble maintaining a constant fuel supply so they should be able to use the armor to its full potential. Perhaps that would explain it?
---
And China didn’t surrender, they were in the middle of having their homeland invaded by the US when the Great War happened. China never surrendered... they just... ceased to exist after the War.
---
Yeah seems to be getting real bad during SBQ, at least from my point of view.
---
I'm guessing more and more people are getting the strangler armor, since the care packages were sent out to alot of players.
---
You dont.
---
They find you
---
I typically run with the same core group, sometimes switch it up. Everytime I'm playing with my core group, we check the lobby for all the well known names. Sometimes it's people we know will be tough, or people who use specific weapons; grenade launchers &amp; snipers mostly.
---
It's always interesting when we eventually team up with our "rivals" and hear their voice for the first time. It's like fallout Christmas. Lol.
---
Oh i remember what lying lowe is now. I remember accidentally participating on it while a team of like 3 tried to beat it.
---
i am convinced any ps4 could run fo76 smoothly at all times, just a matter of optimalisation...
---
i play rdr2, battlefield V, and tons of other games that have no performance issues as bad as fo76 
---
but i still like the game
---
Same here. I play on PS4. Been trying to spread this info for a while. We are always playing against the same people. It truly feels like ZAX is putting us against each other. 
---
People have made friends, enemies, and rivals. It’s even come down to a point where there’s real life relationships being created and destroyed through the mingling of the same players, mixed with the carnage and rumors makes for an interesting time.
---
I just want my character to be able to smoke a dart.
---
I'd say just advertise here or over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals and hope for the best.
---
And guess what? tomorrow when we don't need swarm of suitors that event will show up in less than an hour of game play. They need to add a token for us to spawn a specific event. Let's say for every 10 events we have completed we will be rewarded an event token. We can use our terminal to choose which event we want to brute force spawn.
---
Uno reverso
---
Happened to me last night. I was in Morgantown doing the Nukashine quest, and then wherever I fast travelled to....there it was. After two hours I logged out and back in, and that did the trick.
---
Not sure, it would have auto renewed
---
It happens if you are using unyeilding armour to gain strength/ carry weight.
---
I can help you later, ca 30 mins from now, i am lvl 156
---
They put profit over Product. Its much easier to use the same engine and Clone things from one game to another, thats how Fo4 and 76 look the same, theyve just cloned it and added content. I tested both FO4 and 76 and found both systems had similar if not identical patterns in development, some systems dating as far back as 2015, so it means Bethesda didnt touch it till after the games release.
---
I enjoyed Fo76, unpopular opinion but i couldnt play it now, im waiting for the game to get less glitchier until i play more of it! :) I honestly do hope Bethesda do get better and learn from theirt mistakes, It will help them so much!
---
You lose the ability to use the scrap box. 
---
You can use what’s in there when you cancel but then it becomes a take but do not store item
---
Yeah i think that the damage bonuses of bloodied weapons and beserkers weapons should be swapped.
---
Sure, i already stored scrap for 3 months so i am okay with that
---
No, I meant in the resort shopping plaza itself, not the bunker. There's a BoS vendor there.
---
Just checking 😊
---
Poo piles and gut bags can have glands and the bloodbug noses too.
---
Only sell general supplies like stims, chems, flux, serums, high end ammo, mags, bobble heads, rare junk.
---
Never sell good weapons and armour, use the trading sub reddit as you will sell much quicker at the best price.
---
You can sell terrible legendary items for scrip value, normally 20 caps per scrip. 3* weapon, 800 caps e.g.
---
Whenever I enter toilets in-game I piss myself to help with immersion
---
Gotta be careful with stairs. Yeah, you can place stuff on top and remove the stair.. and those things can then sink into the ground too far for you to grab..making any mistake permanent until CAMP is completely moved. I got several plants locked in the ground but I aint moving.
---
When an event is needed for atoms, does Beth have the ability to turn down the frequency at which it spawns for that one day? Cause if they CAN do that .. they ARE doing that..is my best guess.
---
No because some player would be able to make traps for people that fast travel like placing the welcome mate on the edge of a pit where you could fall of
---
It auto renewed for BF. It's not under subscriptions it's under services. It didnt have the option to disable auto renewal for me but he had to select it cause it charged him for another month after believing it didn't.
---
It auto renews for some people on playstation. It's under services and not subscriptions. Only reason we know it auto renews is cause it was taken out for month 2 for him.
---
The game cant seem to keep bullets in my clip. Youre askimg for a lot
---
"Oh but my camp is on the top of a mountain, there's no ground"  
---
"Oh but my camp is IN a lake, there's no ground"  
---
"Oh but my camp is a spaceship shaped like a unicorn dick"  
---
\-- to all special snowflakes hard luck your fast travel point will be random cos you can't place your mat.  The rest of us want it.  Design your camps around it.   Oh also AusPower another rule, you can't build \*over\* the map.   We solved the problem in 3 h yayy
---
But it's a non-issue when you can just sprint through it, no mutations or rads lost.
---
Leaks say that the subs got them a lot of cash and all we've got fixed was some lightning stuff and a floating item.
---
I understand supporting the company but why support them when they give you NOTHING?
---
   Holidays are coming and we won't be hearing from them until February
---
Remember how long it took to just make it so you could get out of PA without crashing :(
---
Maybe they *didn't* succeed in reverse engineering US compact fusion technology, maybe the just made their own power armor pieces to go on captured US frames?
---
I guess that you only pay for private worlds at this point.
---
I like that idea, it would explain why the parts are stateside and not over in China. Someone also commented that if the parts were to be made anywhere they would be in made under Mama Dolce’s alongside the &gt;!Liberators’ armor!&lt;.
---
Buy it from vendor bot phoniex in watoga for 1k caps or go all the main quests
---
Are you on pc
---
How is it possible to reeaaaalllllyyyyy want something even though I don't know what it is yet
---
Because bugthesda
---
Furious all the way.
---
Instigating is only good for the first shot, and with a 50cal your rate of fire is pretty high so the difference between one and two shots in terms of time is minimal, but a stacking damage buff is constantly going to improve your damage on high RoF weapons on tougher enemies.
---
name and shame my dude :)
---
This is a tricky one here.. overall people would probably say Furious is the better pick for a 50Cal.. 
---
However before you make your decision ask yourself.. do you use vats a lot? Instigating Faster Fire Rare is an extremely strong and misunderstood attribute.. as you fire multiple shots of an automatic weapon, the instigating effect will actually prod on multiple of the bullets.. causing the potential to do lots of extremely fast DPS if you utilise vats to hit all your first shots..
---
Like I said earlier.. Furious is usually more desirable for a 50 cal as this method is more used for automatic rifles.. however the 50Cal already has an extremely fast fire rate.. if there is a way to efficiently use my method with a 50 Cal that instigating one, has some extreme power potential!
---
I've died a thousand deaths (literally) and never got respawned back at Vault 76.  It's always right back "in the shit" I just left.  Can I try Vault 76 for once?
---
Fucking auto correct how did it get fernandez out of gernades
---
Bloody. The answer is bloody well always bloody. Other than that, Instigating + Explosive if all you care about is the opener. (It's a crap combination if you actually want to keep sniping stuff that's close together.)
---
For weapons, a hunting rifle has marginally more single-shot damage than a lever action, but the lever action has much higher DPS. I've never used a gauss in this game, but again, if all you care about is the opener, I think a fully-tricked, charged gauss has higher single-shot damage. Or, you know, an instigating black powder rifle.
---
I can confirm you’ll be able to stash the junk in the new scrap box when at destroy if dropped limits. Done it myself.
---
Do you play alone or in a team?  If you're in a team with friends, if they all disconnect with you, obviously a server.  If they don't, that's on your end.  5 in an hour would be unheard of for me and I'm on PS4 too.  
---
If I had to guess I'd say you're getting wifi interference.  Assuming you're on wifi, get a cheap cable from ebay (only a few bucks and it's just for testing) and use it for a week.  just tell the family it's temporary and try to hide it under a rug :)
---
thx very much :)
---
Really appreciate, I never use VATS. I'll amend the OP I should have mentioned it, I didn't think. :)
---
No don’t worry atall, a lot of people don’t know about the trick with auto instigating Weapons, so just in case I thought I’d let you know! 
---
If you aren’t a vats fan, it’s definitely the furious one all the way for you! Will be a lot more consistent for your play style :)
---
This is like those personals that only have "Hi I am looking for a soulmate are you too? Call me" then don't have a phone number.
---
I think you are right :)
---
Toxic Valley. Go to that Lodge with the huntsman robot and there should be a shit load out front by the water.. Ragstags are pretty common in this map area.
---
Cowboy!  I love it.. I made a caveman.  Uses a spear or bone hammer and sheepsquatch shards. Wears the grognak outfit of course :)    If only you could get a horse!
---
Colonel Kelly Monument in the toxic valley.
---
I will add you, I know the path etc and can hold my own, just need to figure out the seed bank puzzle 🙄
---
I'm expecting it at some point
---
You got my wrong, I am not giving any esxcuses to players. My point is that bethesda should get their shit together and start treating all players equally. They have tools to restore lost itemsdue to their incompetence in term of making that game, like we seen with guys who lost their equpment in raids. They dont do that simple becouse it is cheaper for them to dont have a proper customer supported. As is was show with Battlefront 2  and no man sky proper outrage can causs miracles.
---
Group events you want a mid-tier damage weapon.  Tag first, kill in a few shots if necessary.  I actually remove some damage perk cards for some events.
---
Xbox ? My gt is Martyn Gwaspa
---
The laser gatling doesn't fire if you aim or disengage aim during the charge up. Let it start shooting first *then* aim, or aim first and then charge it up :)
---
All I can say is a collective thank you to all of you FO 1st subscribers for beta testing it for me, when they fix the fast travel bug I plan on joining your ranks =)
---
&gt; and to save space make Bulk items in the tinkerer's workbench.
---
Don't do this -- it wastes plastic an, except in certain rare cases *does not* save space.
---
Only bulk stuff you want to sell, and bulk just before you sell.
---
Says the one sprouting a cancerous opinion
---
Ah crap didn't know thanks bruv
---
&gt;the care packages were sent out to alot of players
---
what?  Explanation required...
---
You can call me a idiot but anyways I only would ever look in the forest 😑😑😑
---
About 500 atoms.  out of about 10,000 available.
---
My tolerance started to tank in the BETA when I was trying to do the DMV mission and you have to do it all in one go, or you start back at the beginning...and the game would always crash about 30 minutes after starting the mission. 
---
Took me an entire day trying to do that mission...had to end up grouping up with my best friend so when my game crashed he kept the instance active.
---
&gt; It's another poor mechanic that BGS should look into
---
You're right. If a multiplayer game requires you not to play in order not to ruin the fun for others, it means it's been poorly designed. I'm afraid this goes too deep for it to be fixed through updated, though.
---
Just use a low damage weapon, you'll still have to "fight".
---
I mean, most enemies are absoluty no threat after level 80 if you've an even remotely decent build so... :/
---
I tried with a tree, slowly getting close without grenadier firing with a handmade and once i managed to hurt a bit myself, stepped back and equiped grenadier, seen no more damage received
---
How the fuck do you instakill the sbq tho.
---
Just west of Top of the World, down the hill past the old raider camp/tower.  There is a trail of old ski lift cars down the mountain.  I've always had a couple that spawn in the little picnic area (where my base is).  Good luck
---
Heh, I have my camp in the Mire, and both my spawn and other players spawn is in the water that gives parasites, always fun to get them simply during loading and you cant help it.
---
That's why you gotta go prime with any light machine gun because ultracite ammo gets crafted way more than regular ammo
---
Whitespring behind the cottages
---
Ive seen some delusional muckers try and defend killing everything as fast as possible saying they want better odds at the shielded underarmor plan... but thats just bull shit, the enemies keep spawning even when you let everyone get a hit on the legendary so theres just no excuse for this shit.
---
Git gud at NW
---
Thanks didn’t want to waste the point :)
---
Really? I had an Inst machine-gun and it was dealing double damage only on the first vats landed shot, the other shots were normal. I assumed it was normal because the effects says "when the target is full health".
---
LIke he said:
---
&gt; * Perforating: *[...]* 20% more damage dealt, 
---
&gt; * Stinging: *[...]* ~8% extra damage
---
I’d rather just not go through it, especially on a private server with no lag.  
---
Why on earth would you not run starched genes? I never want to gain or lose mutations, and I’m using diluted radaway all the time to stay between 5% and 19% health.
---
That it why communication is key if you have a mic let everyone know and don’t let them hog it. 9 times out of 10 if everyone knows about it then they won’t try to hog it. Also that’s part of the reason I always have a pistol.
---
Where have you been the last couple of weeks?

---
I’m not sure how to confirm it myself, I haven’t done much testing, but when I had a Instigating Combat Rifle which this did work with, and it seems to be kept a well hid secret amongst the community, but there is definitely a method to it.. look up more threads, I have seen multiple threads talking about this what everyone calls this “glitch” seeing a thread was how it came to my attention initially!
---
yes
---
Worst warden ever...
---
I am on pc
---
Sorry bud, you got me wrong! :) 
---
I was agreeing with you, both with the OP and with your comment I'm replying to.
---
I was commenting on how people don't usually do what you've done and tell the player that they should modify their behaviour when it's Bethesda that needs to change things up.
---
Why not just keep the game installed? Seems like a waste of time to just keep uninstalling it like rhat
---
It looks like you get your atoms literally the same time and month date when you originally signed up, at least that's what it did for me.  I already knew they would be charging my card two days before the anniversary date for you could see that if you looked up your Bethesda account information as I did.  My card was pre-authorized on the 21st and the payment credited from my card occurred on the 22nd and my ATOMS arrived on the 23rd in the afternoon which was exactly my one month anniversary sign up date.   No big deal.   All my other teammates were charged the same way as I and all of us received our ATOMS yesterday the 23rd.
---
Atomic shop MICROTRANSACTIONS are not cannon and are for fun, don't get your head twisted trying to think how it could exist, 76 is a multiplayer fallout game and beth will add either content or skins that will retcon or make no sense in order to make fun or sell skins.
---
Watoga is great but it could be better, like realy. For exemple Watoga Estates could be a working instanced Player Home like the sink, there could also be a Vault under it (Why not, the town was filled with companys), the Hubris shop could be a smaller version of the Hubris Comics building found in Fallout 4, the cultural center could be a great place to have robots fighting in the arena, etc... I like the current Watoga but I feel like it could be another endgame location, just like the Whitespring is, but this time for other things than legendary farm.
---
Getting upset because someone else received compensation for having their entire scrap inventory wiped is pretty immature. Nobody wanted to have their entire inventories destroyed. And if they have never run the vaults, thy steel is useless. Just live your life, you’ll be happier. Also, maybe read up on what actual socialism is.
---
Bloodied outpowers junkies anyday by effect alone. Then bloodied builds get numerous buffs like perks and mutations tailored just for the build. Not to mention the +15 special points on nearly every stat for running unyeailding armor. Bloodied will always be the meta in this game unless it get nerfed into the ground.
---
Coming back to this post to say, I got the junk. Ended up giving some of it away through the m@rket and then more to two of my friends, gonna keep the rest now, probably. Honestly, I wish I hadn't gotten the junk, but I'm glad I was able to help some folks out
---
Most, kill it off spawn
---
Ask someone to mod your rifle for a few caps? I'd do it for you but on ps4☹
---
Totally agree. I carry an explosive shotgun for this purpose. I tag the boss (and usually cripple them) and wait until all tag it.
---
I want to be able to team up with mad dog Malone in wastelanders.
---
Stop uninstalling?
---
One way is to blue print two (exactly two not three or more) foundations.  Than the blue print can sometime snap to existing objects even when the placement is red.  The key is that among two foundations, the snapping one must be one can be placed normally.
---
Budget cuts at the prison :( the Mayor is funneling all of the cities money into parades and burying soldier remains
---
I didn't dare to think it but that doesn't sound too crazy.
---
Don’t know what specific issues you are referring to but they have been making the game run smoother with each patch, so somewhere in the past 9 patches.
---
That is actually a good idea.
---
Well you see the jail then you know why
---
Upvoted for mentioning encumbrance. A decon shower is the difference between 410 lbs and 350 lbs, and I'm at a camp to shop.
---
Based on those numbers, more people are playing 76 based on mischief night estimates.
---
Ta
---
They used to have it but removed it...
---
One of my teammates purchased the annual Fallout 1st around 5PM on October 23rd.  He waited all day for his ATOMS and it was around 5PM yesterday that he received his ATOMs.  It may be delivering your ATOMS to the date and even time of your signup anniversary.
---
Try to open a support ticket and claim you're a fallout first member, it's something we maybe didn't tried yet, send the proper files ect, when i did ( They didn't even read the file i send tho, the answer was too quick and out of subject.
---
Make sure your gaming computer meet the minimum requirements to play this game was  the sole answer i got from support, i managed to play this mess on a GTX 750 ti OC for a few months but beth's support seems to claim a rtx serie can't run the game properly, on my side i gave up, there's a lots of game offering better services ... free to play.

"美帝必败"  - American Imperialists Must be Defeated!

Yeah it's also true that griefers use them to insta kill other players

Happened to me once and then the prick decided to destroy my entire base, I was forced to grind more Flux to fix my damn shower, was not happy whatsoever
---
If you still need help I can hook you up with Pemican, because I have close to 60 on one char. And can craft you S'mores, just need some sugar bombs.
---
If you want to get them by yourself, Pemican can be obtained by finishing both dailies with the pioneer scouts and S'mores recipe is rather common reward from Campfire tales event.
---
What's the bug?
---
I'd presume 12.7mm is basically .50 Beowulf
---
Urban is a type of camo.
---
Either youre just dense or being a smartass.  Camo that blends into the environment.  Really shouldnt have to point that out.
---
Get a Stadia you won't have the option to install/uninstall
---
 Yet you’re dedicating a portion of your day to post about it. Bye Felicia! 👋
---
Yeah, it seems so-- receipt shows I bought it just a few hours from now so I'll check back in and see.
---
What's the fast travel bug?
---
If My Post makes Even obe person to stop waisting their Life on this shit Ive succeeded
---
Yes, there is an Event in the works. It's called Festive Holiday Event in the game files. Looks to be a Christmas Event and likely won't cover Thanks Giving
---
And rigging his own election..
---
Stay away from the kittens!
---
The person who gifted you the copy is not your friend! The cake is a lie :)
---
Really sure your moronic post is going to help someone decide to stop playing. Go away
---
I saw that happen for the first time at someone’s camp and they looked at me then back at it like they were terrified
---
Atom shop items are not lore.
---
I barely ever disconnect and I’m using a hotspot on my phone for it
---
I think I've got a Quantum or two, about to log on, I'll see what happens.  Dang curious.
---
Revolving door justice system is real.
---
10 bucks later
---
There really is a type of camo called "Urban" 😂.
---
Dont ask me how it works, but its clearly effective otherwise the armed forces wouldn't use it
---
I don’t remember the name exactly but there’s a Ms something I see in almost all my nuclear winter matches and she’s good .....to good 🤔
---
Nope.
---
They can only store 3 at a time anyhow. So I figured that if someone comes to my camp and find my ammo overpriced they can get compensated by picking up 24 purified water.
---
Well if you used a magazine, they’d be better contained.
---
You have "no choice but to uninstall" it? Just... don't? If you're that close to a full SSD, might be time for an upgrade.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Ive had that damn reload clip issue also it seems there is a glitch when they fuddle around too much reloading or gun jam.
---
Plus my weapons wheel constant sgoes back and fourth between things i am choosing and selecting something else by the time O actually get what I want too much time has passed.
---
It is a bit frustrating.  Im just playing to unlock everything though, its annoying getting the same lobbies of people all the time.  Come on level 100!  
---
It is a bit lonely playing solo or with a teammate that doesnt communicate.  At least you got some good mates to play with to make it more fun yea?
---
I would say that but if he’s someone like me and only has a 500mb PlayStation.. sometimes it’s just not an option..
---
Also before you say it External hard drive yada yada
---
This is why i never really do events on public servers anymore outside of encrypted and the SBQ.
---
I mean I don't have a whole lot of room on my Xbox left, that's why I uninstall the games I actually don't play anymore and that i know i won't pick up again. Uninstalling a game that you know you're going to just end up installing again soon just seems dumb
---
I think he escapes it the event jail break fails, which no one does so that's why you always see the mad dog Malone event pop up
---
I live in Argentina. Believe me, we have all the Fernandez I can tolerate, plus two.
---
When I used to have multiple it was half and half. some locked for me, the rest available for others.
---
Didn't have any trouble just now.  Sorry I couldn't help.
---
If fire rate isn't a concern, the Gauss wins hands down, just remember to charge your shots.  Works great for sniping, but don't expect to clear out the golf club in CQB. 
---
If fire rate is a concern, then Lever Action.
---
Bloodied or Instigating and going to be your go-to.  If you want consistent damage then bloodied with adrenal and low health can't really be beat. Instigating is good for a target that is unlikely to need more than one or two shots to take down. Not overly great when running with a team though since others can tag the enemy and deprive you of the double damage on the first hit.
---
Yeah its FO4
---
Nope, sharing is caring
---
This game wastes most of its incredible map with player levels. They really need to change to scaling to make low level areas just as important and as traveled as higher ones.
---
He escapes anyhow. :)
---
&gt;:)

:)
---
Nothing much. Lots of new bugs. Meat week event is relaxing. Hoping for a half-decent Wastelanders release.
---
All they did for the scrap was just give x amount of scrap to the players, for some it wasn't even everything they lost. That was a clearly documented case of an error in the gane causing items to disappear. Most other situations have ended up being the player accidentally dropping/scrapping an item. Bethesda doesn't have the ability to "restore" a lost weapon or piece of armor.
---
We all learned something today
---
Yes I would say that.. but with my fast internet speeds uninstalling a smaller game like upwards of 20-30gbs is no problem.. I can have that back on my system in 30minutes or way less.. is no problem for me anyways..
---
And well what if that guy likes to play a lot of games.. he’s going to need the space.. which we’ll Fo76 takes up almost 1/5th..
---
It’s a big game, way bigger than most of your not someone that’s big into the online multiplayer genre..
---
Not a PC guy, but maybe there's an issue with how the tent is handled in the mod?
---
I have screen records of it dissapearing ( as do a lot of other people ) and the bug is also well known to them. But not here to argue. 
---
Try to talk to Bethesda CS and see how far you get
---
I don't know man, I just don't see the point. I have a lot of games that I enjoy myself besides 76, which is why I just uninstall the ones I know that I don't want to pick up ever again. Any games I know that I'll play again at any point, I just leave installed. I just don't see the point in continously uninstalling and reinstalling a game that you know you're going to keep going back to, personally
---
MissAllen?
---
I stopped going to Uranium for this reason.  Use to love it, now its just not fun because of the turds.  While most of us are cool, get along, play nice, etc, there are always those in the crowd that douchebags.  Just like real society.
---
Cool story
---
It quadruples the base capacity (20), then the stinging magazine adds 15. 20 * 4 + 15 is 95.
---
Ok, that’s cool. I remember it as a good place to build. Very defendable
---
Why would you?  They refill quickly.  Help a thirsty person out. Usually those who lock their purifiers also lock up all the work benches and a scrap box.  Thats just wrong!!!
---
I was fighting the scorch queen last night and after it was killed there were residual scorched to clean up. A guy kept running infront of my shots (was on my level 60 character, he was 180) and I was trying to kill the scorched so I could fast travel home when I accidentally tag him and he murders me and takes all the damn scrap I had gotten. Hate people who do that shit.
---
There was this one time where some guy killed me at a workshop and proceeded to teabag me and sent me some pretty nasty messages. After I killed him I took all his junk (he was carrying a stupid amount of stuff) and I put it all in my stash. Pretty toxic from both sides.
---
The mission where you hunt the bear named "fluffy" or something like that has been broken for me since it came out and Bethesda support really didn't help at all, they pretty much told me to restart the game and if it doesn't work I am out of luck.
---
In uranium i usually pick up a shotgun from the mole miners and tag once then just run to the next one and so on. But in violent night there are usually 200lv. and up characters trying to start PVP at he same time as the event so I only shoot/mele in vats
---
Mad Dog has the best (and only) super mutant lawyer in West Virginia.
---
Lawyer:  Warden stupid computer. Marshals stupid robots. Mad Dog best super mutant. Fight good.
---
Judge(Also a super mutant.): You right. Not guilty. We free Mad Dog.
---
Prison Break ensues.
---
All this speculation is based on a small amount of data mined information. There is very little Wastelanders related content in the files, as the update is likely developed as a separate "2.0" branch of the code base that is not available to the public yet, and the few scraps that could be data mined probably ended up in the patches with back ported fixes. And content that involves living NPCs would not be compatible with the legacy version of the game, so I do not think it is a surprise the leaked stuff includes only some notes.
---
The gold would likely be only what the NPC factions are trying to find, not the reward to the player's character.
---
I think Bethesda gave up on staying consistent with the lore
---
I thought it was arms for the ore bonus but it had to be the full set for the carry weight? Hmm.
---
Yesterday I got like -15 karma because I didn't know that gamma guns are capped at lvl 45, and i told a guy that "i don't know for sure but i assume fallout 1st won't renew itself" because i didn't think that games could set up a system on console to charge you like that.
---
You seem to be new to this subreddit.
---
no, i never saw the point of doing it.
---
You had the foresight to record the exact moment your weapon disappeared? Because I'm finding that even more difficult to believe. Also, most other threads regarding a weapon or armor disappearing ended up as I said, or ther person never had it to begin with and was looking for a handout.
---
I've played since release. Remember when the hopper from the Feed the People event could steal your items? My 13k 308 remembers. Where's my shit bethesda. I guess they cost 10 dollars.
---
No, but the why others do seems pretty obvious.  They want it for themselves probably to sell to vendors.  They built it and have no obligation to share, but it is nice when they do.
---
You used to be able to put items into the hopper for feed the people that were not just the ingredients. If you put something other then them in they just disappeared. It took 13k 308 from me. Beth "we cant restore lost items". They cost 10 dollars to get customer service.
---
They nerfed alot of the pvp, camp destroying, and added survival mode(rip). I think that made alot of toxic people leave. I remember a long time ago. I was always afraid of people being near or around my camp because people would just destroy it for fun
---
I think what you’re saying is that you think they should use forest scout armor instead of urban scout armor?   
---
If so I agree.  
---
The forest colors would probably be better than the white/gray urban colors.
---
I’ve heard it can be dropped, but vault steel and modules can’t. Not sure as I haven’t tried it myself though.
---
No it was spell as Ms then it had like 2 names after it with no spaces if I see her again I’ll update my comment
---
You can clip the last minutes of gameplay on PS4 so this discussion is pointless my man.
---
Im not looking for a hand out i am just very annoyed that  3 weapons ranging from 20 to 30k market value can just dissapear and CS only gives an automated response and closes tickets without any response.
---
I hope you lose your stuff what you grinded for, we will talk then
---
Google camouflage and educate yourself.
---
Yeah okay thanks
---
The subreddit seems to be completely disconnected from the actual ingame community from what I have seen.
---
Yeah, it had something to do with Stings &amp; Things. I think I had actually finished it, though. Anyway, support went in and reset that for me, which cleared it up.
---
Bloodied Gauss. If perked right, you can kill most things by just tapping it.
---
Add me and come claim your prize.
---
That happened to me when I was playing with a group of randoms to exp farm only to return to my remains of what used to be my camp
---
That's been my strategy for a long time, it's incredibly effective. You don't need any shotgun damage perks, just enforcer and maybe skeet shooter for distance. Works particularly well on legendary fog crawlers in Arktos and sheepsquatch in free range so the melee players can get in without being twatted. Love my shotty
---
There is not enough information to make a reliable comparison that takes into account all the platforms, but [this chart](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox) by Microsoft shows Fallout 4 being played more than 76 or ESO. Although ESO still made more money on PC in 2018 according to [Steam's top sellers list](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/winter2018bestof/), so player numbers alone do not tell everything. I guess the Crown store must be a fair bit more profitable than the Creation Club.
---
Having said all that, I would wait for the Wastelanders update, which is likely also when the Steam release is planned. Actually, I do not think FO76 is doing that badly considering the initial sales and reception, and that the game is more than a year old now and is still yet to receive the first DLC of real substance.
---
Same dude that throws your toys round the map for Chloe must get him the key somehow.
---
Well there you go princess, go ahead and sue and come back with your results. You seem confident enough. 
---
Oh and btw, you’re on reddit, not bethesdas’ support. You must’ve gotten the two confused.
---
Nope. No locks on anything.
---
I think I've turned off Pacifist like 9 times since it came out. Otherwise it's essentially permanent.
---
Hey so does no one here watch RTGame?
---
To me, I don't mind it. I'm just curious on how Bethesda will implement a foreign design of power armor
---
Depends on what your wanting to do. Bloodied is the PVE meta for sure, nothing comes close to it DPS wise. Junkies is the PVP meta simply because of the damage cap against players. Theres no reason to run a low health build because you can easily achieve the 110 damage cap with a full health build.
---
If you'll look into the damage table you'll see that as long as the target has 60 DR or more (basically anything that won't die in one shot anyway), the AAE packs more punch and doesn't suffer from accuracy penalty - your choice is much better than the TSE.
---
I don't even have water purifiers. Waste of budget.
---
Yeah, I think most of the people that actually use this sub don't play the game.
---
Very true.  What specific aspects of this game are unreplicable in another engine?
---
In morgantown you'd rather use urban
---
Happened to me once a couple weeks ago.
---
You submit a ticket and bethesda will deliver 4 pack full of raid players.
---
Great advice, you sound like a good player. Events are way more fun with a little cooperation. I play a prime heavy gunner and spent 50% of the sbq event working on the mobs and healing others, keeps the event flowing and make things more interesting for me. Getting plenty of thumbs up after tagging and alerting others to legendaries always feels good.
---
Bloody Unarmed here. For essentially all events I'll tag the enemy with a Gatling and just dance around blocking. Once during Free Range me and like 4 other Level 100+'s were emoting and dancing around the Sheepsquatch so the Level 28 got their hits in. Then my cue to power attack it into the ground.
---
Five people getting legendaries is better than one person getting a legendary.
---
This has been an issue since day one. Bethesda needs to change kill credit system for events. Nothing in this game is challenging enough for AFK farmers who still have to manually join the event to be a horrible issue except SBQ, but there are so many adds there that you'll probably wind up dead anyway even if you don't get hit with the crop dusting attack if you try to AFK.
---
Can confirm. This also happened to me with the Yao Guai that spawns on The Whitesprings golf course.
---
if chinese troops were on the US mainland it stands to reason materiel such as weapons and PA would be left out there. Im not a lore expert so I dont know how that would work. would be cool though if chinese troops had hijacked a Vault and thus emerge as en npc faction. Probably not, but it would be fun to get something new to snipe at besides super muties, ghouls and scorched.
---
When I had 5 I always left one open, now I only have 3 so can't really afford to do it as they're only the ones you place in dirt.
---
Yeah, I'm bloodied, it's the only way I can play with m8s and still be able to put all I can into a fight that can go down too fast as it is. If you're teamed, it's amazing experience.
---
I personally live it, but you're right, efficiency isnt there. There's at least one sb at each site tho
---
Only lock my acid harvester, even leave the scrabot box open, but nobody ever takes it. If you have a vendor, you should leave one water purifyer open for folks,even if you also sell water.
---
I'm the same as you, but I use a quad Tesla instead.
---
Tesla. Molotovs (not grenades, you egg.)
---
This is absolutely the first place to look. Good post.
---
Yeah I don't get it either, but there seems to be no end of garbage players who'd rather blame the game than take a look at what they're doing
---
Yep. I only have enough to accommodate me. Then again I'm in the Mire so a low traffic area. If I was in the Forest or Divide I'd build more and have them unlocked.
---
I have read on here that it does, have never tried it.
---
Huh, people are endlessly inventive.
---
It is a bit of a sick move to lock them. Some people sell water, so... I don't even have water purifiers. There is water everywhere.
---
Wear a mask
---
What about bloatfly glands? Those get no love?

happened some times when the ghouls fell through the stairs, contiuned my spree and later returned and the body had transitioned to a meat pile on top of the stairs. that or your way usually works even if it is frustrating.
---
Nope. I structured my camp around having as many free offerings as I could while still building a layout that I was happy with. I’m the end I have 13 unlocked purifiers, an assortment of food, an unlocked scavenger station, and water access. I enjoy providing the little things that people need as they pass through.
---
A cargobot encounter spawned on the gold course the other day.  Cargobot just hovered 10 feet off the ground, carrying nothing.
---
Can confirm. I have plague walker on one of my characters Nd i accidentally kill Brahmin all the time. Poor fellas.
---
It's rare I ever interact with other players but my camp is situated right next a workshop. Like 2 days ago I was on a server where a lvl 10 character took over the workshop so I decided to go grab a bunch of plans and stims and was gonna go give them to him. No lie by the time I gathered all the stuff from my stash and started walking over I see a lvl 280+ guy came and steamrolled the poor new guy and claimed the workshop. The new guy logged off immediately I assume since I couldn't locate him after that. Pretty aids.
---
Considering the way they handled the Halloween event, we may not see a Christmas event until New Year’s Eve.
---
Thanks for posting a truly genuine and insightful comment despite the reception of this thread.
---
They're both good choices and both do excellent damage. I'd go AA, I prefer them and you can use them outside P.A.  Furious is another option, especially on the 50 because of the fire rate. Reluctantly sold a Furious FFR Gatling that dropped,  *almost* decided to spec back into heavy weapon for it because it looked fun.
---
That is quite an assumption. How do you know the op isn't a dog?
---
I do actually, because I only have one and when I need water and there's none there it pisses me off
---
You get the plans by taking power plants. Go do one of the nuclear power plant quests.
---
[PC] yes constantly :(
---
I totally agree with you on that.
---
Yes, especially with unyielding (weight reduction) armor and backback. At least I can respawn at my teammates mostly.
---
I dropped action boy at 3 pieces ,but it could even be two if you diligently apply music bonus every hour.i currently have 4 but i wouldn't go for a 5th. 
---
Other factors like the well hydrated bonus and lone wonderer can help as well.
---
There are legendary scorched in game
---
Thanks
---
And that's awesome, it's honestly what it should be.
---
Not the way people would like
---
I would love to see that vid. Can you upload to YouTube and post here?
---
My friend had an unmovable stair and floor, he built floor around like your idea and now has 4 more unmovable floors.
---
Yep. Seems to happen after exiting atom shop. Enter a world then quit to get the Character pick back.
---
It's odd the polarity off people in things like Uranium Fever. Some people triple-check the legendaries were tagged by everyone. Some people clean house for themselves. 
---
Once I killed the final legendary in one shot by accident. I felt pretty bad. :[
---
Also, I got the Shielded plans and all I did was stealth vats the mobs, tag the legendaries, and repair the extractors. It's all RNG.
---
Bloodied hunting 50 cal rifle and instigating  Gauss are my best rifles for sniping. I suggest limb damage for killing or crippling. Easy fights.
---
Basically this: “We’re aware of your frustration and are saving our response for a future update.” (Not an actual Bethesda quote).
---
Well what they were referring to was the TSE bug at launch. TS use to add 100% weapon damage and E would add another 100% weapon damage.
---
Yes there is legendaries, but 1 of the more rare enemies to spawn as legendary. And the legendaries are usually the leaders lol ran into a lot in Harper's ferry especially...
---
And I agree. Usually if I accidentally one shot the legendary I just give that item away. I am not usually hurting for scrip.
---
If you are on PS4, hit me up. I have all the serums, I will make sure you have replacements if needed, after cleaning out your plage walker. Same psn as name here.
---
This happens all the time, seasoned players knows this all too well, but good info for the newbies
---
This plus bloatfly glands PLEASE!!!
---
Yep those too
---
Good times!
---
I have fun with 40mm grenades. Uranium, encrypted, campfire tales... I have a bloodied one for mob control and a regular one for tagging.
---
And hardened mass!
---
Happens to me as well. I just dashboard, and it's back when you relog.
---
Every single inside the vault. People still complain but they do address issues. 
---
What specific issue are you experiencing/are you wondering about?
---
sometimes they teleport direktly from the crate to my stashbox,...but mostly they buged/glitch in the amorycrate. 1 way to solve is try to get only one or two, it worked for me. honestly it work realy rear BUT it can fix it ;) good luck\^\^
---
\*crap the artillery and build them completly new also did not work
---
Except in reality your 10 minutes is usually just a few seconds, if you can't be deal with being courteous to other players for that long it's not the game's problem. I've been tagging and waiting for others since I started playing, it causes me no problems whatsoever, I don't miss out on anything, it doesn't disrupt the flow of the game and more importantly for me it means I don't feel like an asshole for ruining things for others.
---
Last night I was at Whitesprings, late in a nuke just me and a L30 in the zone, I tagged and waited by a 3\* for nearly a whole minute, even went and found him to call him over, just so he could get in on it. We ended up running the rest of the night together having a blast. That's how I enjoy the game, but you're free to play however you want, just as others are free to call those who choose to one shot in group events selfish assholes and complain on here about it.
---
This is directed more at the problem than you personally btw. I get that it can be annoying to adapt your play to consider others, but why should it? I love changing my play style to help others, it feels good
---
Agreed
---
If you are on PC I think I've done a Uranium Fever with you.  I saw someone doing that exact thing.
---
I got the year.
---
I lock 2 for every 4 I put out. I like to give others some high quality H2O.
---
Sorry lmao.
---
Maybe his cell is like the jail in Mayberry, with the keys hanging right next to it?
---
Thank you for the tip! I’ve been having this issue...I’ll start looking at spawn points.
---
Problem is not bloodied, but sinergy. Combine it with mutations and five pieces of unyielding armor and you are god. But by itself, it is fun and not overpowered. 
---
Unyielding is the broken one.
---
You know the corpse in the pipe at the dam? That was her husband before the war. That’s why Karen “Mad Dog” Malone keeps going back.
---
Nope.  Take whatever you need.
---
Heck, take junk from my Collectron too (just don't turn around and whine about "P2W" if you do 😋).
---
I feel you bud. I miss survival mode every damn day.
---
I'll have to look out for them, would be interesting to see if they drop the Staff, Clubs and Bone hammers etc as the Ghouls mainly drop the  Vanilla game weapons I've found
---
Barney Fife for warden.
---
Where do they normally spawn during radiation zones though? Are you saying I have to go into the crevice?
---
They can restore characters from backups, losing any progress/items earned after the backyu point, as far as I know. I haven't seen them restore actual items. Have there been posts about it?
---
I've resigned to the idea that it must be some kind of kinky game they play. 😋
---
Is toxic kindness a thing? /s 
---
It’s true, though. Most people I meet in-game are fun to co-op with, or are at least non-hostile. The few who do want to be the bad guys don’t seem to have a very fun time by comparison (but that’s just my personal observation).
---
I haven't seen a legendary scorched forever
---
Stw3793. Should be on around 3 pm est
---
I dont know how but yesterday i experienced no issue during 3 fights whith 3 people having the strangler PA around
---
If you got a letter from PS Support, it had nothing to do with Bethesda, it was Sony.
---
That being said, at least you only got a warning.
---
Sorry, went to bed.
---
That mod has not been updated to support the tent marker and it will cause a CTD.
---
Your friend should remove it from his load order.
---
There are 3 variants of the armor (standard, advanced and elite as you said) an two skins (desert and riot) for all of them. I thought that the variants will be monthly, but maybe they will go with giving paint one month then a variant the next month and so on
---
Just one? :P
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/E79Z5bP.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/E79Z5bP.mp4)
---
Well being more rare don't remember for sure but think I've gotten random guns and stuff like any other. Also if you ever see the scorched hoarde event on the map go for it always 3 star lol.
---
Instigating hits hardest for an **undamaged** mob or player. I prefer VATs crits and therefore +50% crit damage and +10% damage while aiming weapons, coupled with sneak attacks (even better at night with Mister Sandman) to explosive. Gauss does big damage but doesn't always play nice with VATs due to an intermittent bug related to the charging of the Gauss. Explosive will tag nearby mobs with a tiny bit of damage and well, say byebye to instigating. Two-shot is fine if you forego VATs and instead use only ADS.
---
People prefer bloodied weapons + unyielding armor + nerd rage + lone wanderer + mutations (adrenal reaction) for sustained big numbers. [Here is an example "bloody" build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f343ff&amp;d=sb0p02pp2eh2c72ir2ar2an2ao0a51a04a30l71l12lt2lk2lu2lr0pd2pk2pl2&amp;w=&amp;m=25fec10ab&amp;nw=&amp;n=BloodySniper) You'll be useful for everything except face-tanking the SBQ herself (your role during that fight is add management, which is no less critical.) If you prefer to be able to swap in Gunsmith 5, take 2 points from PER and drop "Concentrated Fire" to 1 point. Consider using "Chem Fiend" in place of "Fireproof" with 5 addictions, to use Junkie's weapons to be dangerous with full health, and get even MORE dangerous the more damage you take. Junkies will give you max +50% damage as long as you have 5 addictions.
---
Sounds more like PS support is silencing you because you can’t be a mature adult. If stupid people want to support Bethesda’s latest bullshit, that’s their prerogative. Your temper tantrum, on the other hand, is against PS’ rules.
---
My next door neighbor doesn’t like FO1st, he hasn’t picked up his mail since two weeks ago, now I’m very concerned 😱
---
This is the most delusional shit post I have ever seen
---
Bethesda has nothing to do with what happens in ps messages. That's Sony.
---
There's backpacks now.
---
You can trade your legendaries for scrip and gamble the scrip at the purveyor which is pretty cool.
---
A small quest that involves a sheep.
---
The worst raids you'll ever experience in a AAA game.
---
ok, just for my understanding:a higher firerate evtl.   can multiply the bullet effect? fire faster than the hitdetection to multiply is also  theorethical possible ?
---
So if you havent done the whole Sheepsquatch questline and the Pioneer Scouts one then you will have some new things to do, but otherwise there isnt really a lot of new things except the Vault Raid which is laggy and not very pleasant to do in adventure mode.
---
Yet, I've never once seen that event.  How do I trigger it?
---
same old bug is back
---
It was already confirmed that the issue is being worked on, but do not expect it before next year:
---
&gt; * **Additional Public Events Improvements** – We’ve heard your feedback that the cooldown between Public Events is too long, and we’re planning to reduce it by at least half with a fix we’re including in Patch 14. We are also planning a second phase of Public Event improvements that will bring additional cooldown adjustments, performance-based loot, and remove the need to tag legendary event enemies to claim their loot. Phase two of our Public Events rollout is currently planned for early next year, and we’ll update you as we get closer to those updates.

---
Additionally, a "wholelistic" balance pass on the game was announced (in the [GameZone interview](https://www.gamezone.com/originals/interview-fallout76-e32019/) after E3, and again at the QuakeCon panel) to come with, or shortly before Wastelanders, aiming to normalize the difficulty between low and high level players, especially at events.
---
I think these changes, together with the legendary player system, are all part of a major overhaul that is meant to be introduced in one large update. Probably because they are intended to work together in one "package", and I suspect also because some of the changes might be controversial (as expected from any major re-balancing, it is likely beneficial to some players, while nerfing others), so it is best to release them at the same time as a large and highly anticipated content drop.
---
On PC hardened mass dont get autoscraped
---
When youre strange, pvp stays lame🎶🎶 lol
---
Filthycasuals is a pretty happy sub. But there are alot of good people in the community either way. As far as toxicity, It's alot more memorable when someone shoulder checks you as they walk by than the 20 people who smile and say hello to you.
---
It is a common stratety to have someone in your team be wanted but from what you wrote it kinda puts you as the bad guy since you should just move along, not start hating on them for paying their money for f1
---
A robot similar to Liberty Prime but in the Red China side is heavily suggested by the propaganda posters that you can find all around the Wasteland, so if the Liberty Prime PA isnt canon, this must not be canon either.
---
this is seriously asked 10 times a day, plenty of info around, just use the search button
---
Not true. My counties jail looks the same and it still holds 900 lol.
---
China now owns shares in Bethesda. Soon, the USA will be the bad guys and the Chinese will save the world from them in that story too. They'll also ban you for saying Free Hong Kong in chat.
---
Clear out West Tek leave server join server rinse and repeat
---
I missed the part where bethesda has anything to do with this
---
I used to lock two of the large ones, and have two large and one small unlocked with a flashing sign and vaultboy pointing to them, and mine were located on the opposite side of my camp.
---
Extremely common 3rd person glitche as well, where when you reload, it auto fires whatever you're holding. Makes it worse, when you empty a clip of 5.56, or are holding a grenade launcher. This happens to me several times a day
---
These guys foam at the mouth as soon as a workshop is claimed. Best advice i can give is to stay far away from them. Scrap sucks anyway. Lol.
---
That's a lot of wee to obtain such legendary 3\* immersion, you are doing the Lord's work and should feel proud of producing so much waste in the wastes.
---
🎧 😎❤
---
Yes -- for diluting stimpacks, radaway, rad-x. I don't drink purified water so I treat it like a resource node. (Corn soup for life!)
---
Purchase Fallout 1st
---
cwg141 I'm on right now
---
I agree with you, some areas are like walking through a kitten factory, no risk at all.
---
There’s no limit to your imagination, how about it’s a prototype from a lab somewhere in China, or a US defense contractor that worked in secrecy with China, or it’s inserted from the future with a time machine by the Chinese in order to alter the course of the war. All those scenarios are not far from reality in real life today.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals is definitely a cool sub
---
They never said the outfits would be a monthly thing, although we know several variants of that outfit exist and haven't been released yet.  We'll see what happens on Tuesday.
---
Those are easily verifiable. That has nothing to do with toxicity...
---
Keep doing the "power up" events.
---
Have you been to the penetentiary? That place couldn't keep a radroach in. Broken walls, easily picked locked and super mutants or scorched everywhere. I mean the front door is unlocked and everything.
---
JohnWhitmyre I’m on at various times and I have a good group of friends I play with
---
I mean true, but new players don't know that. They are just doing what the game tells them in the quest log and getting curb stomped for it. We shouldn't be pushing newbies away like that.
---

---
No. Also what kind of mad person locks their purifiers and sells water at 20c each!?
---
My point was 15 downvotes was a little excessive, when someone could have just told me i was wrong. (Which they also did)
---
I only Bought a single month for testing purposes on the private server involving mods and such, so I dont know anything about the years worth of atoms.
---
Problem is not everyone knows where everything spawns. So it should stick to where it died
---
When i level up my mules i just do Whitespring clubhouse, easily 10 levels from after work play. If you can play all day long, 20 levels a day is piece of cake.
---
*carrot soup
---
Not enough people playing to make the game toxic
---
Just got the plan thanks
---
I love this. Thank you

r/emojipolice hands in the air!
---
In all seriousness, who knows right? Maybe he has sneak 100
---
Weapons in the explosive class, yes. Weapons with explosive secondary perks, no.
---
Haha, it's funny because today I tought the same thing about him. 😂
---
Yes n no. I make sure 2 water supply is available for the taking for free. Lock the rest for own consumption
---
No
---
Yep
---
You are most welcome
---
You can't say as of right now DLC are free very ingenuously, because they have changed their monetization strategy post release and no DLC has been announced or released yet, aside from the membership items.
---
Or, given how the game is designed, you don't really MEET a lot of random people unless you go out of your way to actually interact with others. And unless you friend them, you will NEVER meet them again thanks to the random server assignment every time you log in.
---
The Inside the Vault articles from [September 26](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again), [October 17](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more), and [November 21](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1KMNMgbLCfaHQVKby5zqVx/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-november-updates) tell what you need to know. Most of the work is focused on the Wastelanders update, and everything of substance (including major fixes) was delayed to Q1 2020. Until then, the game is generally in a playable state, but expect only minor fixes and maybe a holiday event.
---
Well if you look at the state that the prison is in then it’s now wonder he keeps getting out and criminals are known to be repetitive. But what was he charged with in the first place?
---
I actually really like it. It’s a bit 3D and not just flat which for whatever reason impressed me. But I’m easily impressed apparently.
---
This is cannon now !
---
That would be a good perk. Meanwhile two or three armor pieces with the +25 Poison Resistance and you’ll never notice poison again.
---
You dont need to rig the election, if you are the only one to vote for ! !&gt;:D
---
I kept my two purifiers locked, but that’s because I sell purified water to vendor bots for caps and use it to make my own adhesive (vegetable starch) for weapons and armor maintenance. Now that I have a good adhesive stash and my caps are at max I can unlock.
---
I locked my front door, but at least two of my workbenches are near the windows. Also my balcony door is not locked and is a marsupial jump from the ground.
---
Do you think they'd run into bugs with emoting when playing an instrument?
---
Everyone sticks to there own personal questlines and leave other to have fun on there own, like it should be ! The cancer switched to the BR Mode or leaves again, because people dont stay in the game for hate, they just come after youtubers can make money of clickbaiting bethesda baiting videos again and the come to the sub, not into the game.
---
Yes, however, you will not be able to put anymore scrap in. Just take what is in there out.
---
Yes, but you can only withraw items.
---
You can take items out of it but you can't put anything else back inside
---
Nope, free clean water for all.
---
Lol mine is Zeroifg1. I just started typing when they introduced usernames. I didn’t think it would stick around.
---
*subscribes to fallout first*
---
I run like 4 pieces of AP refresh and lone wanderer plus level 2 nerd rage. Definitely dont need action boy
---
Darn. Since its bethesda i didnt think they would think of that lol thanks
---
You should check out factorio.  Arguably the nicest and most welcoming community in the history of video games
---
Today I learned that Bethesda has complete control over Sony. Which makes it odd that Sony was so hesitant and put so many more mod restrictions on Skyrim and Fallout 4 then Microsoft did with their console.
---
It happened to me and without going to atom shop so that's not the trigger. Like you said it's easy to work around but still annoying.
---
It is mentioned in the lore that after the US first deployed Power Armour - the T-45d in early 2067 - China began working on their own design but it was years behind where the US was with their efforts.
---
Similar to how the US gained cloaking technology really. They got the concept, but didn't have the necessary know how and resources to make it work effectively.
---
I complained a few weeks ago on this reddit about never seeing a single legendary scorched in my 250+ lvls and over 1000 hours played except for the scorched hoard event.
---
 The very next time I loaded up the game I encountered 2 random legendary scorched in 2 different locations and haven't seen a single one since.
---
Certain items are only available from murmrgh I believe. Ghouls can drop bone hammer too.
---
Shame they didn't ban you
---
Yeah still haven't got my atoms
---
I just bought the game if u dont mind a newbie i would like to play with u guys!
---
psn: Kajexel
---
Relevant link: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorched_killer%27s_receiver
---
I literally am a junkies build, it’s god tier for pvp
---
Yeah, I've got two pieces. Totally negates it.
---
That's why I carry my 50cal with me instead of my melee weapon at events like this. A few shots only does like half damage so if there's lower levels about they can still actually kill the thing without worrying about dying, or I can finish it off quickly if they're overwhelmed.
---
South of vault76 there are 4 passive animal spawns near the lumber yard. Incidentally it is also good for the picture one where you take pictures of non-aggressive animals.
---
The only time it happens to me is if I die right at the end of an event.
---
I pvp so I need as much as I can get.
---
I run full action boy, rejuvenated, 5 powered pieces and lone wanderer when alone. 
---
My 300 ap regens in less than 1.75  seconds
---
Yes but just because I actually need it with the Speed Demon mutation I seem to never have any if I leave them unlocked
---
I haven't played the game in so long I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.
---
I was wondering if you had to be the one to land the killing blow on the SBQ to get the atoms but I have no idea
---
OP should hate pvp too considering I ran moneytrees into the ground the other day
---
Its awesome and u will really enjoy it
---
You can expect people on this sub to complain "THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY BROKEN!". Even though it's not. They'll tell you that they've been playing since BEFORE beta (somehow), and that it's ruined video games forever, and they'll be angry at YOU for daring to play a game they don't like. 
---
It's a fun game, especially when you set your camp up just the way you want it, get your vendors selling regularly, and happen across a sweet weapon or two.
---
Limp damage got nothing to do with how much damage you do, it only cripples the limp faster.
---
This sounds like hella fun tnx a lot. So how do vendors work?
---
Pure joy and excitment the likes unseen by man since Alexander MacRae invented the banana hammock!
---
I just told her, just for you!
---
Well, I'm blind. Thanks for the help!
---
Pretty sure i said foundations, not floors :P
---
Your friends floors are not grounded to a foundation, that's what happens when they get stuck!
---
Note:  Ghoulie died on the way back to his home planet.
---
I was like thinking that is there some lore for it. I haven’t been to the prison for a year so I don’t remember
---
I got mine yesterday which was 30 days after getting 1st.
---
I raise you one Overwatch
---
It's not all that random
---
Furious for 50 cal mg. Instigating for 50 cal sniper rifle
---
ngl the story isnt the most intetesting but you have fun with it the first time around and if you dont balance your character right your gonna struggle later on so dont max out things like intellegence or charisma
---
Of i try to tell them at my vendor machines, they literally multiply by the amount of tapes i put up for sale.
---
Can't cancel the sale, so I relog, and voila, duped.
---
From the other perspective: it's really fun going in with a few friends in team when there's already a few mid-level players there, charging in like Ironclad Cavalry. We're here to help, boys and girls!
---
We usually spawn at the Prime site in X-01 with Strange in Numbers shared and Class Freak 3 to suppress negative mutation effects. Then (I at least) take drugs, shoot smaller enemies for more Adrenaline, and then get to work on the Queen. We have a shit ton of stimpaks, so healing people who are downed is no issue. 
---
Ideally then those mid-level players keep those radrats and mirelurks away from us while we unload on that oversized Bat. :)
---
Edit: by the way, don't sit on the fences, please. It makes the Queen land less.
---
I have to ask. Why?
---
With as popular as OW is your guaranteed to get a few normal tempered people that even the playing field Imo. Dead by daylight is truly wack.
---
Man bat. Hmmmmmmm 🤔
---
Well I mean, they do have electricity. And Guards.
---
R u on xbox?
---
There should be a special storage box for items like this. Like 5lbs
---
because all the toxic people are too busy bashing the game instead of seeing it for what it really is. For all the looter shooters i’ve played this is by far the most fun.
---
agreed! i always have a weak gun on quickswitch so i can just tag and let everyone get a hit.
---
Bloodied works fine in PA, you can even get the Emergency Protocols mod for torso to make you a lot harder to kill.
---
I can headshot crit from sneak for about 2.5k like this with a Gatling Gun.
---
That’s really cool, hahah. Love it! I’m actually leveling another character to play a PA heavy weapons build. :)
---
That's fine. I have a good laugh every time I log in and see someone paying an extra $15 a month to play a game that's still broken after a year and lacking content. I suppose it works out if you were going to buy atoms every month anyway. I've got over 5K from grinding because I can't find anything to buy. That's why I can't justify the extra cost for myself.
---
But just think, you can pick up all the tin cans you want with no limit. Truly, you have the last laugh.
---
Monster Mash, I often get four Legendaries although not guaranteed.
---
There is a weird issue where Scorched rarely spawn as Legendary NPC's, it's frustrating you nuke somewhere like "Top of the World" for a chance of pace and get scorched as the spawns..
---
I actually think the Legendary Scorched we find are glitches, because they are missing the "Legendary Conversation" spell on their race(aka they cannot convert to legendary versions)
---
It's better then Mole Miners, that are completely missing the Keyword, Template, and race ability to convert, so the only place you can find them is Uranium Fever.  
---
  
---
Issue has been submitted to Bethesda and documented on the Bug roundups
---
[Fallout 76 Bug Roundup | NPC's - General](https://www.reddit.com/r/76BugWiki/comments/dsa2ts/fallout_76_bug_roundup_npcs_general/)
---
Each time I read one of these posts, I can't help but to ask - who cares?
---
Why lock it though? There is literally no advantage to it.
---
There is however one disadvantage: griefers (and genuine PvPers) use locks to get themselves wanted by picking them in your CAMP.
---
Nah, just drink. Some rads are good for your sperm count. Gives them boys mobility and shit.
---
Industrial ones can store 5.
---
Tupp, realized that after postning but was too lazy to edit.
---
Been suggested to Bethesda hundreds and hundreds of times, and the worst part is you could fix all of these in 30 seconds!  
---

---
Seems like 1 out of 3 times I head up to the roof the scorched leader just before the final stairwell is a legendary. Just make sure to let him/her get their legendary star or you miss out on the legendary drop like I did the last time I went there.
---
Then what is fucking me up? Acid damage? I have 5 pieces with poison resistance. Plus 25 effect.
---
If you're selling Purified Water to vendors, I feel for you. It's so inefficient. 
---
You're better off making and selling clothing for 100 caps and serums if you can afford to make them (sell for 500 caps with a little CHR, Hard Bargain, a beer and Grape Mentats).
---
And it frees up CAMP budget if you don't have 20 purifiers taking up useless space.
---
So I can level up efficiently.
---
&gt; 13 unlocked purifiers
---
2 isn't enough? lol

It's a B.E.T.A. age bug that appears to have gone from very rare to increasingly common with Patch 15.0  
---
Documented and Submitted Bethesda more than a couple times.

Stay Filthy!!!
---
Key phrase there is "When I used to". You only need 3 max (I have 1, unlocked).
---
Can’t have anyone going thirsty!
---
It could be useful enough to have poison resistance as an effect of Med-X again, it does not even have to be very high. Especially for people who would have the perk swapped out much of the time.
---
Good for you? Really nobody cares. Idk why idiots keep posting garbage like this here. You need the attention that desperately?
---
I personally only pay around $8.20 a month because I paid for the year. Its been more than worth it. Me &amp; me mates must have been some of the few gamers that didn't get broken games because we've had very few issues &amp; have a lot of fun playing. Other players opinions of the game matter very little to me. Gamers who haven't played in over 6 months or more still trash talk this game &amp; that too is very entertaining.
---
Certainly not me. I simply find it amusing.
---
My best advice is to find a junk pile, they are quite plentiful around the starting area, and set up camp there. Then you can eventually set up an auto extractor which will mine it for you giving you tons of material to work with for zero effort. Just remember to lock it up.
---
I'll help you out if you're on PS4. I can build you a camp and hook you up with a starter set of weapons and armor, ammo, and plans.
---
there is something worth nuking in every area.
---
also, did you ever consider the other players were simply curious?
---
I don't do it (hell, I kill enemies that I spawn at camps I fast travel to) but some people will kill the owner's Brahmin (from the fertilizer station) if they find camps all locked up like that.
---
I usually put on PA with a Jetpack and fly over their building, looking for workbenches in front of windows or unlocked backdoors. More than once that's how I got in anyway. One time the owner was really confused and kept following me with the ??? emote while I scrapped, repaired and stored. Then I fast travelled away. Never will they know how I got in, lol.
---
Yea..that's exactly what it is. I'm "desperate" lol
---
Really impressive! Hats off to you.
---
I doubt it.
---
For weapons and ammo, just use whatever you find while deciding on what weapon damage perks you want and get the ammosmith (agi) and super duper (luck) for maximizing crafting yield. By level 50, you should have most crafting perks as well as max damage on the weapon class you want to stick with and go from there.
---
For camp building, using the scrapper (int) perk will give you loads of steel and wood when scrapping weapons and you’ll get plenty of camp object plans from running low-level events and claiming workshops. Claim Poseidon energy plant workshop often so you’ll get the biggest water purifier and fusion generator.
---
Some do and some dont.  Locking them means no one else can take water so u have lots to drink and sell.  When I started, I locked mine for the first couple of weeks so I could get my water supply up (characters stay so thirsty) but now I just keep them all unlocked.  But I know ppl that have locks on everything to try to keep griefers away but it's a preference.  I prefer to share. :)  Stay filthy!!!
---
Happened to me as well in a few locations on ps4
---
Well I don't want some Schorched and Super Mutants to wonder in my camp. And I haven't really met a griefer yet.
---
But he still does all the time....
---
Downloading the game again after a long break. Would be great to get on this and level and explore in peace
---
PSN - RGDV91
---
Down to play with anyone and everyone!
---
&gt;Five people getting legendaries is better than one person getting a legendary.
---
THIS!!!
---
Lol, I have always ignored that quest.  But now I am intrigued, lol  stay filthy!
---
Probably because this game doesn't appeal to elitists and elitists make up most of the toxic community in MOGs. It's one benefit to not really having a standard endgame or PVP design.
---
One can only hope Bethesda will take advantage of this community and actually add text chat and lobbies for private servers soon. I've had mostly positive experiences with the community but in-game I've had a handful of interactions in like 5 months of playing. xD
---
Cool. Adding you! Game is downloading as we speak:)
---
Sorry I had to do this lmao :D  
---

---
no one cares you have a scrapbox besides other 1st members.
---
FO1st member trolling is a myth.
---
Omg I'm so tired if it. Just happened for the 4th time today. I've restarted game and system both.  Also if you die right as the queen battle ends you cant respawn. Just have to let it spin till it finally does if you want your event rewards. This or restart the game completely. Plus if you respawn at 76 you get the privilege of paying for s fast travel back!!
---
The power went off 68 times when i was there in winter of 2017. And the guards are worse than the inmates. Lol. Only difference was the color of their shirt.
---
So somebody saw your box and decided to nuke your camp? You only assume that you were targeted for being a First member. You have absolutely no evidence to support that assumption.
---
I am in the mire, across the river from Harpers Ferry, I get some traffic. I dont lock them cause everyone needs purified water.
---
Beautiful, cheers dude!
---
Where is your base located? I've seen people nuke bases for all sorts of reasons. Overpriced stuff, having all clothing instead of armor, being to close to event spawns, being in someone else's base location. Are you running the fallout 1st player icon?
---
Thank u for this!!!! 🤝🤝
---
No one wants text chat?
---
Can't we write in Mad Dog Malone?
---
If only the game was as good as the community....
---
ps4, should’ve included it lol
---
okay, thanks!
---
Ya this basically happened to me too.  I think the last mission is so buggy you can't complete it.
---
One of my favorite PVP experiences was when I had a workshop and three players took it from me, we had a 15 min battle 3v1, and after a while I gave up and stopped attacking since I could never win against all three. After going non hostile we waved at each other and exchanged plans and stims, and I dropped a bunch of ammo.
---
hey that’s be really helpful, i am on ps4, my psn is leosmkk666
---
Nah Ps4
---
Won’t happen on a public sever
---
I'm fairly confident it exists, since all the other ones do, but I'm not sure where.
---
Other than being in the Forest, there aren't many distinguishing features.  You don't see any structures or roads either nearby or on the horizon.  My guess would be that it's somewhere near the railroad between Wilson Brother's Garage and Grafton, but I don't know that for sure.  I just remember there being an empty, field-like space to the west of the railroad tracks there.
---
i’ll definitely take note of that, thank you!
---
You must not have played for long
---
It still does this, huh? Welp it’s been a year for me since I tried last. Best of luck with a solution
---
It’s hit and miss for me, a lot of the time people just didn’t seem to know using the full 24 minutes is the best way to play.
---
If the game is dead, feel free to not post in the sub anymore. It looks like most people are still having fun.
---
LOL!
---
Shoot, hoping we could team up sometime.  Well u know what the next step is? U need to go buy an xbox, lol!  Stay filthy!!
---
Savage divide region, isolated though &amp; I can for one say there are not a lot of spawning locations &amp; very few plants other than a few berries. I'm not saying 100% it was because we were 1sters but I don't have a vending machine on this character yet but bother me and my teammate both have scrap boxes and they made sure to position the nuke to get my tent as well. It didn't bother us, just thought I'd share for a laugh but looks like most people are just offending &amp; that doesn't bother me either.
---
I will check that out, thanks.
---
Wow, that's still a thing? I remember just teaming up with random people before doing a silo just so I could rejoin the same server and rush through when it crashed.
---
That was in January.
---
If you're that close to a spawn point, they can easily spawn inside your locked CAMP anyway. Just do some bug extermination. ;)
---
The thing about griefers getting a Wanted status is so they can trick (new/inexperienced) players into attacking them. Then their team mates come crawling out of the woodwork and level the CAMP.
---
I can help you in an hour or so if you'll be around. I'll add you now, my PSN is justseeker623
---
If this doesn't work, as in you go to where it would have spawned and it's not there, clean up your excess meat piles, and within a few minutes itll pop back up. It's annoying but works. I had a legendary vanish, knew where it spawned, but it wasnt there. Looked in the floor, walls, hell even the tree. Left, cleaned up meat piles in area, came back through and it was there.

LoL.  yes it still does it apparently.  I've been playing on and off since launch but only reached this point now (pretty casual).  I can't say i'm surprised it's not fixed.
---
yeah that works for me, thanks a lot btw
---
No offense, and notes are cool, but I want txt chat.
---
Oh wow. For a long time i had the disconnect... reliably after about 2.5 hours. But after the NW update it never happens now. ALL UR OTHER errors, I've literally never had one of em! Bizarre. 
---
I wonder if other uses can affect things? Such as websurfing on ur ps4? Something ive never really done. Very troubling indeed, that would drive me nuts. Have you tried reinstalling it? Or could the effects be related to ur connection? Im sure you've thought of all this, sorry. Im just wondering
---
Some people are just  there to do the event how it was intended imagine that
---
Go into building mode, remove turret, put in storage, then put it right back.  It will stop that.  I did it to all mine.  I just don't understand the big deal on it....it's a bug that doesn't effect u, annoying but easy fix.
---
Honestly doing it as quickly as possible and then moving on to another location is better for overall legendary and xp gains.  I've done that before and it's not that good. Only the charred ghouls drop max level stuff too. Not worth it.

I got my shielded underarmor plan drop from Queen of the Hunt, which one drops from Uranium Fever? Is it also the casual?

You too!

Lmao
---
This is what I do and I’m sure most people think why she charging that much.
---
This is why I don’t like the MMO format. Kills immersion.
---
Lol yes
---
Maybe they should read the game's alert about opening themselves up to PvP better, then. It's a learning curve. ;)
---
I’ve actually ended up in the same servers multiple times with names I recognise

It wasnt a crash you silly goose, your character would just forget how to function and would require restarting

Limb damage makes it easier to cripple, it does NOT increase the damage dealt to the limb.

I had a legendary scorched from a horde clip through the ground once -_- pissed me off cause it took forever to find then by the time I killed it disappeared into the ground
---
Where at at by the lumber yard was there last night and didn’t see anything
---
Yeah but these newly found remains belong to perceived rivals of the mayor.
---
Thanks for this. I have a scenario where it might help.
---
But 1st 👌
---
This. The Brotherhood of Steel didn't exist at the time of vault 76 opening, and the NCR didn't exist for another 170 years, but nevermind all that, NCR RANGER SUITS! 
---
Bethesda doesn't give a shit about anything besides money. No wonder they became the laughing-stock of the gaming world.
---
Hi, Engineer here, looking at the power armor it’s pretty clearly based on the excavator frame and I reached the same conclusion 
---
TLDR: this dude is correct
---
A double xp weekend with everything above would shoot u over ur mark.  Stay filthy!!
---
I found dozens of guns and junk yesterday. I was so overloaded that I had to walk half the map to my camp, lol. Felt like Gollum, not gonna leave my treasure. But still, didn’t know what to do with all that junk so I took some random workshops, fixed everything and built defenses. Life’s a joy when you got the swag.
---
might have just been that you were in their camp spot. I dunno
---
raptureeeeee
---
Interesting...I though only grenades...whats an example of a weapon in explosive class? Always though it was secondary perk.
---
Workshop is a PvP zone. Mabye don't have take workshop or get private severs
---
No idea. Radiation damage is the only problem I have. Swarmed by ghouls, count on me to get 75% rads and at least one disease. Scorched beasts, though, just no problem at all.
---
I just checked under my services tab and it still just lists the one month, thankfully. Remaining time is "-". Nothing recurring on my end so far. That sucks it's auto-renewing for some. Thanks for the heads-up. 👍
---
This would be cool. As it is, I regret buying the fridge. Why can't I keep 50 corn in it for a week??
---
Uscript works the same way.  Haven’t done anything lately so i don’t know for sure about 4+, they’ve changed to c++.  I’m curious about what the creation engine does better though, seeing as so many projects are planned for/built on ue4.
---
Even an empty frame will give you a carry bonus. But there is still another mod for even more. 
---
Yet the ore mining bonus comes default on the suit. 
---
I guess I'll just have to test it myself.
---
Yep, you can do PvP without being toxic. My first time I was level 40-something and a level 30 showed up. 
---
He started shooting me, but I noticed he was hardly doing any damage (probably had bad cards, I quickly figured). I proceeded to gooify him with my Gatling Plasma. He came back with a buddy and they tried again, but failed. 
---
Then they came back one more time, just to tell me "fair game", and asked for advice. I explained how the 3 Commando cards worked as they both had automatic rifles, and I said that this also works for Heavy Weapons, etc. They thanked me and went on their way. :)
---
Nothing specific as there are many little bugs and inconveniences in the game. I am curious what the senior devs have to say about the player base’s general distaste for the game’s state.
---
Not that I owe anyone a disclaimer but I do love the game and see the changes made that make it more playable.
---
It would be interesting to go pick up the former mayor at the hideout that Mad Dog Malone told him was, "Like, totally impossible to find."
---
Where is Murgle? It’s around lunchtime and I think a cat meat steak would really hit the spot right around now.
---
I would do that all the time cause I was so powerful before they nerfed TSE was doing about 1000 damage per shot so I was 1 shotting people in power armor also
---
One month old account, first post ever in this subreddit. Seems legit, lol.
---
I think that’s an over generalization, “the player base’s general distaste for the game’s state”. Everyone I play will is pretty happy with how things are now. Been playing over a year. It has improved significantly. Very stable, no real persistent issues anymore. Random bugs occur, but same as most games these days. Nothing that makes it unplayable, at least for me and people I play with.
---
Whew. That’s relieving. Must have missed that thread.
---
Of course, a beautiful in-game community where the best interaction with players without mic is the "hello" emote.
---
You don't feel a toxic community because half of them can't talk.
---
I had no idea they fixed it! I had long since written it off. Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah, happens to me all the time. And the other folks here have workarounds. Not a big price to pay for several hours of ghouls to me and my team.  Kill all...rinse/repeat.  WS worth nuking in PW.
---
I lock all my materials other then water always feel free to some water and I also have beds upstairs if you need a rest
---
200 stable flux and in a nearby container a BE handmade... Probably someone dropping and server hopping, either way, it looked sexier in my inventory.
---
Ik that but I needed fusion cores and I'm not spending that much money for private servers I pay enough monthly for this game due to ps plus
---
😳
---
No, you can take a workshop either way, but if you're on a private/paid server, you're totally alone unless someone on your friends list joins you. If you take a workshop in a regular server, just hide/crouch somewhere if you don't want to risk pvp. Also, don't defend it against waves of enemies. Just reclaim it once it's overrun (the rewards are basically the same). When finished, hop servers to give it up.
---
Even tho your door is locked if you can get your power armor in there you can basically walk through walls learned that for science
---
hold on, they probably have a youtube link and be sure to watch till the end!
---
But there's a point where wanting everybody to tag everything just becomes too much. Like one time when I did uranium fever there was 10 people there. It's just not possible for everybody to even get a shot at the legendaries even if you tried. So times like that you just have to be content at what you get.
---
Yeah, there's no way this is going to be implemented. At best it would be with just the emote above your head, without the animation.
---
A crap ton of plans in a suitcase at station.  Best day ever!
---
Fuck I love peeling them off
---
Oh wow been playing since day one and didn't know this. Thank you!!
---
I am not sure if I would prefer having these items removed from the auto scrap list entirely if they are needed only for one quest, and are easy to acquire. It could become an annoyance to have to manually scrap them every time. Ideally, the auto-scrapping would be disabled only while the tadpole quest line is active, and not after Stings and Things is completed.
---
Yea I was doing it the intended way the other night and someone higher then me messaged me to explain this technique and it was helpful to understand why he didn’t want me playing the intruments
---
I live alone so it's not other users affecting my connection. Also I have almost zero issues playing any other online games, so i.dont see how it could be my connection. I have NOT tried reinstalling, though I don't see why that would matter.
---
no. we just think you sound stupid and we’re making you aware of how stupid you sound.
---
A poor carpenter blames his tools. Don't blame others if you just want to be a dick, take personally responsibility for your actions.
---
Reddit is the land of perpetual butthurt. I think some people just get on here to find something to be offended by. As for FO 1st if people want to pay for it good for them. A lot of people act like the game isn't about someone making money and that it will magically get fixed even if it stops being profitable.
---
Did you take some ideas from rifle gaming I haven’t watched his video but I know him and a bunch of other people made a raider settlement
---
That's because everybody quit.
---
Playerbase is virtually dead
---
Ive had this problem on PC as well....i use a xbox 1 controller

That’s what 76s quests are but without human NPC’s
---
Until someone buys it from you. Then it'll be gone. But you'll be rich! ;)
---
It wouldn't happen with a proboscis, but I have heard from my friend that someone bought a 10k "You've been insulted" note from him as compensation for a good weapon.
---
Alright tnx for the help
---
Just like a pair of sopping wet panties
---
Haha. Then you must try buzzblading them.
---
And here I am using up all my nuclear material crafting Rad Ant Lager. xD
---
Calm down Hillary

A "lock" feature would do it. As if the item was in a display/vendor.
---
Can't, I'll moan
---
It happened to me to I killed him 20 to 30 times he killed me only 2 times I tough players in survival mode were good.
---
lol tbh i was offended OP thinks there’s some plethora of players out there with an axe to grind with FO1st subscribers. shit sounds straight schizophrenic.
---
Dude, I sell them for 10 to 50 caps.  I have like 50 between my characters. Buy them all I give you a discount. Add me.
---
Welcome to Fallout: 76!
---
Thanks for your excellent work. I always see your comments pretty high up in the Patch notes posts.
---
I've only done the event once, and I did stop the jukebox to draw it out. What was strange though was that there was only one legendary amongst all the ghouls, and a guy restarted the jukebox with 7 minutes to go and it was barely enough time for the wendigo to show up. In fact, another player picked up a banjo to move things along at the 5 minute mark. I thought it could run down to 4 and still have plenty of time left.
---
Good idea. Could also be an aid item.
---
This would be very good for Bloodied builds (because of low health, poison is the bane of their existence).
---
800 fiber optics in a container. Sold them to a robot vendor as I was  level 16 at the time.
---
Awesome album! Thanks for sharing.
---
I don’t see the point in it. I don’t lock my lead extractor either. I have stash containers of some form in just about every room of my camp as well. It’s meant to be used as if it were your own camp. I’m tempted to lock some of my camp doors as I don’t like when people leave them open, but it means more for me to provide other players with access to all of my benches, and to see the cuteness that is my camp.
---
Ha I wouldn’t be bother if someone did that and they could only buy 1.
---
If someone is there before me, I'll do it however they are.  If I'm there first I just fire up the Jukebox and let it run.
---
The other night someone higher level than the alt I was on kept giving me the thumbs down while I played an instrument...dude there were 90s left in the event, time to spawn the Wendigo.
---
I killed him at the dam when I explored the location for the very first time. Thirty seconds later, the quest starts, so I got excited, thinking it would complete since I just killed him. Nope. He respawned right behind me.
---
Sometimes I want to jam with my shades and patched suit, sometimes I want to milk the event.
---
I was on a server once, a long time ago, where pretty much every train station had Legendaries in nearby suitcases or the cash register.  It was like a Legendary fairy went through and dropped off stock at each one.
---
The jail break one? I think it randomly starts every once in a while
---
Same with Swarm of Suitors (in the Toxic Valley). Just kill all Mirelurks but one and let it reach the island. That event stage will "fail", but instead of failing the event, you'll spawn a Mirelurk Queen. Kill it for more XP and the event will succeed.
---
Also, at Line in the Sand (near Fort Defiance), don't repair the turret (but keep repairing the generator!). You get more XP to yourself, plus you can decide when you want to drop the Scorchbeasts (e.g. not when they're over the Fort).
---
So THAT’S why I saw these in someone’s machine for 25k!
---
City elections are something else in WV, some are daily even.
---
I have yet to ever find a sloth in the Cranberry Bog when needed. At least crafting healing items is easy! xD
---
Scorchbeast queen fights are easy ways
---
Did you just assume its species?!
---
Lol yup
---
Locking features behind a paywall when they said the only paid items would be cosmetic, the canvas bags, Nuka dark rum, doxxing, Bethesda is a billion dollar company, they can afford servers for the next 30 years and not have a dent in their pocket, don’t be so naive
---
Well, we know chinese power armor was a thing, or close to a thing towards the end of the great war. And if not that, then its probably a post-war modification from mama dolces.
---
I can disprove that I am hillary, I wouldn't have deleted my posts and account at this point by now!
---
There seems to be a lot of radio towers etc on the hills beyond, up from Wilson Bros.......the cutscene (if that is what it's called) doesnt have any.  Trying to look down from Camp Adam's now, but the weather has turned for the worse  lol
---
Hopefully it will be found eventually.
---
The Sheepsquatch vanished, time to dig under the earth
---
I don't, that is why I said no to the question..  It was asked why and that is a common reason.
---
Your camp doesn't appear on the map. So you think someone was running through an isolated area, found your camp and its box, got mad about it, marked it on their map, went to a silo, ran that gauntlet, and nuked your camp. Alternatively, someone was looking for a new place to nuke (check Mappalachia for resources around your camp) and your box was collateral damage. Which sounds more likely?
---
You say no to basically free scrip and XP?
---
Not really. Looking at a comparison of the two, its actually pretty different. The only real similarities are the pauldrons, but there are still huge differences.
---
Psn: Chazo136
---
I have 1st so I can set private servers up for friends
---
Yeah, I meant a general "you", as in, "anybody". Was trying to explain why that reasoning is flawed once you're over level... 30?
---
Happens a lot if you die when you are at your wieght limit.
---
About time. I've been milking Brahmin for a year!
---
I think people too often assume it's about their subscription and less about people just wanting to be a dick.
---
“+50% limb damage”
---
I literally see that the damage numbers are higher shooting an arm than the chest. You’re wrong.
---
20 marsupial serums and 200 stimpacks. not even joking. actually i killed a level 10 or something and im not sure if he glitch dropped it. right after i killed him bombs dropped all over the place.  but i survived after running for a minute or so. can soneone explain this?
---
He’s always drinking MD 20/20?
---
In PVP, raid armor and an explosive fletchette harpoon is a death sentence. With a single piece of poison resist, you can just barely survive a single shot from full if you have a little more than 300 HP.
---
I've swept through there on a few servers now with no issues.
---
I've seen more toxic activity in this subreddit than in the game itself.
---
And yet, you seem to feel a need to defend your investment. I still play the game, but I'm not going to encourage Bethesda in their attempt to have a smaller, easier to manage, more profitable playerbase.  We'll see how I feel after wastelanders but right now it's not getting the attention from me it did when I paid full price for it last year. 😉
---
i just server hop 98 nar regional and kill the sentry, mostly full core every few minutes, no workshop drama
---
Hunter hunted has never really been used.people prefer random encounters then that horrible challenge.plus it just one kill.like a battle royal.lmao.ive got iver 1500 hours in so?I know what I'm talking about when it comes to PvP.you don't
---
Yeah I love glitching like that. Or I’ve even spawned inside their house. That’s the best!
---
Yea I always die close to my limit
---
Ive found it before! It was during BETA though.... It is somewhere north of Vault 76 is all I can remember.
---
Not really applicable here, but just to make sure you know this -- the cap limit has been raised a while ago from 25k to 30k. Also, people can come back with alts/mules loaded with caps. They might, if you have good stuff in your vendors (like 2* or 3* AAE weapons for example).
---
Have you seen the Fo76 discord community?
---
It wouldn't have been a big deal if they didn't violate their terms of service and charge me early.
---
To compound the issue, I've yet to receive my ATOMs
---
Really, ok thank you!
---
It really was a gamechanger. The fast travel to vendors means a level 5 player can travel to Watoga safely, while I had to walk/sneak all the way from the forest (highly recommend that level 5's). And a level 7 just came into my camp and bought a T-60 jet pack plan off me for 20 caps. Probably better spent on stims but whatever.
---
Yea that’s what makes me the most mad I’ll be queen battling and die right near the end of the battle and by the time I pay my 40 caps to get back the queen is dead and she has no loot on her.
---
Welcome back. Player vending is definitely my favorite update and I cant wait for wastelanders to come next!
---
There's one in the morgantown airport
---
If the server is slow or if you're quick enough after fast travelling, you can sometimes walk in through walls that haven't spawned in yet, too. :D
---
Player Vending and Backpacks were huge additions to the game for me.
---
I've noticed this for quite a while too. Been that way since beta days
---
When your killed you can’t spam anywhere but Vault 76. It’s especially painful when your far away from where you died and have to spend caps to get back.
---
Yea that’s def me
---
I found almost 3000 steel the other day
---
I love this and I am unashamed.
---
Lmao.sounds like you've never seen someone tank a TESLA.yes you can.shows how little you l oe of PvP.I can tank quad teslas all day.
---
Pain in the dick isn't it?
---
It really is, especially when fighting the queen. I’ve had her die while trying to fast travel back and she won’t have any loot on her.
---
Lol hunter hunted .that's like saying that cal it 94 is actually a "raid mission"
---
My buddy actually got him to trade the other day. I was pretty surprised but don't recall him selling anything worthwhile from the screenshot he shared.
---
Oh yeah I know it’s increased. Just saying only 1 person could buy 1 but if they wanted to come back then could and buy another one. I don’t sell high value stuff in my vendor just so I never go over.
---
And Apple is a billion dollar company that could sell their products for only 25% the cost they do and still not make a dent in it but they still sell them at full price. This same argument can be applied to literally every single company that has ever or will ever exist.
---
Always check blue suitcases, many of us dump stuff in them still.
---
I had this issue last night. Half asleep, up too late trying to finish and didnt realize I kept scrapping parts.
---
Yep, I have a water pump for the public but I lock my 2 purifiers and the collectron's scrap box, I'm wasting the camp budget on it and I need it for my crafting.  On the other had most of my recipes are under 9 caps and most plans under 99...
---
Small typo that confused me. Just remove the word "the". :)
---
&gt;  Slow down **the** and get the progress bar
---
That’s called being a shitty company though. Bethesda has broken promises and lied to consumers multiple times. Anyone supporting them after their shitty atrocities has battered wife syndrome and supports people like trump
---
I wish!! Survival Mode was so fun.
---
I just had this, too. Been server hopping, looking for asylum outfits and came into an instance where the entrance hall looked oddly empty. Further in, tables and washing machines were missing in the rooms before and next to the elevator. On the 3rd floor there were no crafting stations, no toilet stall doors, etc.
---
I quit the game client, but haven't had the time to log back in to see if things are back to normal.
---
ETA: Things seem to be back to normal now, so it looks like restarting the game client fixed it.
---
Its all those people who received 600 vault steel making strangler armor who are fucking it up
---
People do want text chat, whether you're dismissive of those people's wants or not.
---
I personally give callouts and hold fire after I get a hit in on legendary enemies. I’m almost always in game chat so I try telling them I’ve got eyes on a legendary  and taunt to get their attention.
---
Maybe its the prime reciever?
---
I'll be on around 2ish EST!
---
I had those recently, sometimes even dropping inside my camp. Not sure exactly what it is that fixed the issue, but I got rid of all the supply requisition tapes, and avoided the Morgantown airport area, and the air drops seem to have gone.
---
He keeps escaping because of the worthless warden
---
My wife and I played for around a month at release. Haven’t touch it since, but hopping back with new character builds this afternoon. Any suggestions for someone who hasn’t been following any of the updates?
---
Prime receiver was unlocked from an SBQ dropped plan, i suspect the last one is related to the sight/scope.
---
thank you :)
---
nope, but please do try and prove me wrong...
---
I've looked into limb damage quite alot
---
Urban camoflage's good for hiding in shadows and plants - it helps to break up your outline so that you don't look like a person when you're crouched in bushes or near rockfaces
---
Agreed!  Furthermore, what kind of mad person buys purified water!?
---
It's what the Grafton Monster's head looks like under it's shoulder muscles /s
---
Agreed, I find myself filling up my vendors and changing prices so often without even thinking of doing something else. I just love the sound when another player buys something. There should be awards for that - might even lower the ridiculous prices some players have in mind.
---
Having played on a private server it’s actually kind of hit or miss. Some days I can spawn a lot of legendaries, some days i spawn a ton of normal feral and some days? Nothing happens and I get bored and turn the music back on.
---
God I love the scenery of fo76. Took so many pictures and enjoy seeing them on loading screens.
---
Or just dont act like cancer.
---
🤪
---
I have not had any issues and have ran a fair amount of nukes lately, including 3 so far this week - lots of friends In party running them too and have not had any issues - so interesting to hear this is creeping up for you.
---
You could still shoot stuff. Lol
---
&gt; Probably because this game doesn't appeal to elitists and elitists make up most of the toxic community in MOGs.
---
I would say not even only in the games themselves, but generally in any community.
---
But of you're already lvl 100, what is the point? Respec perks?
---
It was funky before the care package drop too. Its def worse now, but its been a thing.
---
Try the NAR Repair Yard and the Flooded Trainyard. I’d say 40% of the time I find legendary enemies there, as well as fixed spawn points for plans, magazines, recipes, and mods.
---
I find it hilarious that someone would actually downvote me for saying OW is toxic :P
---
He's hacking and smacking and whacking
---
But you just said the best songs would be removed. 😂
---
I'd recommend checking all the vendors at whitespring resort. A ton of the plans that were hard to find and expensive to buy from players are now dirt cheap. The bots are spread out in the shops. Also XO-1 mod plans are available in the enclave bunker now. You can also get your daily caps from a single vendor instead of having to hop around the map.
---
Leave.
---
I dont know but someone needs to STOP programming the farmer robots to attack people.
---
Never.
---
I thought they were all vault dwellers and the curators mistook the blue jumpsuits for union outfits.
---
you have angered the gods
---
"You're gonna have to shut them down... Again" or whatever she says 😂
---
or a jailbreak quest that answers this whole thread.
---
Better yet, allowed custom filters for Auto scrapping. That way the user can pick and choose what will be Auto scrapped and what won't be.
---
The Gods are smiling down upon me, Chugga. Can you say the same?
---
Yeah noticed this with rail rifle. You can get 10 vats crits off with ffr.
---
more often than not this is the frustrating one --- when legendary scorchbeasts disappear. but man, can you imagine fissure diving and exploring!!
---
Those sound like great additions. Thanks for the tips
---
I haven’t used an instigating Railway, but I’ve herd stories 🤣
---
The new Ace Phoenix sequel is fucking weeeeeird...
---
This is the biggest reason why I dont play and am just waiting to see how wastelanders works out.
---
Every event I join now, some guy in excavator is firing a gun that shoots electricity at everything and drops it in 1.3 seconds. I can't remember the last time I was able to hit an event boss for 1 point.
---
mad dog? i hate that name  you hear? nobody calls me mad dog! now dance!
---
Hey you! You’re finally awake.
---
I find it is quicker and more lucrative to get to a fresh location with new spawns then it is to stand around waiting there.
---
Me go to San Juantinao...  Many Mutfruit and yummy ghoul meat...
---
The name will be Fallout 5
---
You were trying to cross the border, right?
---
shut it horse thief
---
Yeah, mainly. I’d like to have options, perk-wise.
---
What date did you purchase Fallout 1st?
---
Not just that. I camped at Dyer Chemical to loot blooms. 3 days, not a one. Moved my camp, went back at night. Flush.
---
It is only flawed if you care about camp space, I see plenty of players who clearly don't, so it is pretty much effortless money.
---
What do you use them for; because I need that acid.
---
Enjoyed the tour, and you should consider posting to the 76 settlement page. Really liked the mixture of walls, and I’d enjoy coming across this camp. Great work!
---
My camp is near the vault. I sell ammo in stacks of 1000 for about 10 caps per stack.
---
new players need bullets and have few caps. I make my money back selling plans.
---
if they said someone was following them across servers doing this shit i would agree. but a single nuke? it’s almost humorous.
---
i wish someone cared enough to nuke me :(
---
This is 100% due to the lack of server wide communications or well, ANY communications for that matter.
---
most 'toxic' players do so via communications. Without that, they get bored and do something else.
---
Why don't you sell high value stuff, though? It's easy caps! You probably know this, but to other people reading this:
---
You have to learn a bit about prefixes. Furious, Anti-Armor, Explosive and Two-Shot are good first tier legendary effects for weapons. Faster fire rate and 90% reduced weight are the best second-tiers. Things like Hunter's and Mutant Slayer's are the worst. In terms of armor, look out for Unyielding and Vanguard, as those are the most popular in my experience.
---
It depends on what other effects you have on the weapons and armor that sets the price. For example, a level 40 Junkie's Explosive Combat Rifle with reduced weight is worth way more than a level 45 Instigating Laser Rifle with +1 Endurance and 20% reduced junk weight. 
---
Some people stare at the level numbers and the fact that they both have 3 stars, but fail to realize that it's the combination of legendary effects on the right weapon (Laser Rifles suck) that's so valuable. Those are the same people who put 1* legendaries in their vendor for 10k. Not worth it.
---
Inexperienced players also run around in all non-legendary heavy combat armor because of the DR numbers, while I in my flimsy Vanguard armor will have 3 times the *actual* damage resistance. If you just take the time to familiarize yourself with legendary effects, you'll discover all of this as you go along.
---
I didn't see it, it was my own idea. 😊
---
&gt;  and proceeded to teabag me and sent me some pretty nasty messages.
---
Thank you! 😊
---
I have two of the big ones. I lock one and leave the other open for guests to use.
---
I unlock the junk extractor, too.
---
Go to the settings on r/fo76 and choose user flair, then choose the group you want to be associated with
---
Well, you could shoot exactly strait forward to where you were looking
---
Yeah, I came back because Wastelanders sounds cool...was surprised by so many little changes.
---
He means the forum, (not being a marketplace) - I likely have a few, and that BE Gauss for trade as well. HMU bud.
---
Trees are stuff. Lol.
---
Correct
---
Yay!
---
I trade high value stuff in the trade sub. I make 20-30k a day in my vendor just from scrip weapons, serums and slightly rare plans.
---
same with workbenches. If you can reach from a window, it will pull you inside.
---
Server hop until you see a bunch of vendors near the vault (they'll be right around the bridge that leads to the overseer's camp, if that means anything to you).  Those people seem to specialize in catering to low level characters.  Then the big decision you have to make is: Power Armor or no Power Armor.
---
It works on private too. Idk why people wouldn't use starched genes, I was just including it because it was also mentioned.
---
Youve earnt a babybell cheese wheel, next time you go to the shop treat yourself to one, youve earnt it champ
---
That’s true and I would’ve committed suicide already if you were her
---
Was lookin through your previous posts... you do some damn fine work with these camo builds. Very immersive.
---
I have the list of PSN names also if anyone needs them
---
Its like you can read my mind. Babybell!! Woo!!
---
Yeah, I so agree with you, the fact that you can fast travel to vendors really opens up the game!
---
Nope
---
In the early game, I liked the area near Tygart Water Treatment, which is close to Helvetia, Horizon's Rest, Sutton (train station), Summersville, and even Whitespring is not too far away from there. Later I moved the camp around for a while exploring the map, then finally set it up in the Savage Divide, near the Top of the World (central on the map, and close to a number of good locations), but the Whitespring train station area is also good (although in heavy use by other players' camps).
---
Sometimes they also re appear dead in a spot they went before. Sometimes it’s not just where they spawned first
---
New characters is a great idea, I would consider going through the entire main quest again because they've made significant changes. if nothing else the story line makes a lot more sense now when compared to the environment you're going through.
---
Oh, and that robot vendor inside the Morgantown airport? Yeah, gone now. I liked that protectron.
---
No, he just looks that way, he's actually a football player.
---
good roleplay. downvoters are dumb.
---
Oh I do, I was just being silly about the food build thing, cuz I use thru hiker, so I'm a food build...
---
I usually end up stuck in the floor pieces. Ha ha
---
Yeah, that's toxic. That's why I said "unless you trash talk". But I meant PvP-ing in a workshop is fair game. :)
---
I posted about the same issue. The “die” and are red.
---
Nice, good to hear that folks are actually setting up vendor shops. And the power armor vs none is always a big choice... I personally prefer to not use it, but it’s really challenging without it in many instances. Any updates to power armor since launch?
---
you are correct
---
I agree that you can PvP without being toxic. But really there *are* two warnings about PvP. First at level 5, and again when you're about to take a workshop.
---
Then again, I'm the type of player who, while waiting for team mates or something, will just go help out a level 25 get out of the Forest. :)
---
Report them?
---
yeah, but still kinda shitty.
---
Especially when it's a worthless farm workshop with no value and that one shitbird is stealthed on a roof waiting to 1 shot the owner, and then doesn't bother to even claim it. Those people need a new game.
---
random 2-3 * legendary items, most were shit but the scrip was good
---
I doubt I could do anything about that, are they high level?
---
I think they patched that because mine haven't been auto scrapped, the ruptured or whole gas canisters have to be manually scrapped, last I checked them.
---
No doubt it doesnt effect everyrhing. Also, poor rng lol
---
That's why, if you make it through, you keep jumping! ;)
---
But yeah, a friend of mine has a camp that's really large and open (one side doesn't have walls) and *every* time I fast travel to him on a new server I have to fast travel again because I'm stuck in concrete. FFS! :)
---
Sometimes you can also drop your PA and enter it to become unstuck.
---
Glad the story has gotten some attention! It needed it.
---
And that sucks to hear about the airport vendor. I used to go to him all the time
---
Yeah, i kind of feel like theres a clear warning as well, but if this dudes a level 10, we all know hes doing it for the mission. Thats kind of where i stand. I just figure dont screw with anyone under lvl 50 unless they screw with you.
---
I didn't know people were still trying to get those outfits.
---
I can confirm and have been awear since my first encounter with a wendingo in toxic valley I was snipping it while it was inside a house. It came for me so I killed it, its corpse spawned in the house and I looted it there.
---
Its happened many times since, my most recent was the worst. Killed a behemoth near a lake. Its corpse returned. Only to walk into a cliff face never to return. I was unable to loot it in time.
---
I saved the the recording on my xbox but have no idea how to share on here.
---
I miss having a good pc, I have kids, I game any way I can
---
Glad it had a happy ending though, that does show people who 'grief' are only playing the game like us and not bad people, it is Bethesda who are constantly dividing the community by their actions.
---
Im on for a few hours now
---
You are worthy of the title 'Pioneer Scout'.
---
A full Imposter sheepsquatch outfit.
---
Happy to help, really would love for Bethesda to stop tripping over themselves and give us the game this could be! ;)
---
I've only been playing for about a week or so, but the big thing I've noticed is that the jet pack plans are everywhere and very reasonable (for up to T-60 armor).
---
Actually crafting one looks like a problem though (at low levels) due to flux requirements (end game materials).
---
Crafting 10 or 14 times is pretty small sample size, it was probably just bad luck. With a large quantity like 200 water, it averages out better. Edit: it actually does look suspicious that you got a 50% increase from 200, that must be either an unusual level of luck, or the description of the perk is not correct, or the RNG is buggy.
---
Well, yeah, against say Scorch Conquerors, I pull 80-130 Damage but against a fucking level 45 Angler, I do 12.
---
The only reason I keep a 90% reduce weight Tesla
---
Most PvP players I've bumped into are very enthusiastic about the game.
---
Exactly.
---
I've got 3 different photos of Murgle doing cute stuff that rotates through my loading screens. Some people might not want to invest 3 out of 50 max photos to a single creature, but I think it might not be enough photos.
---
Try not locking the fusion core generator
---
Fallout 76 is the "Who's Line is it Anyway" of the Fallout series;  a game where everything's made up and the lore doesn't matter.
---
I see it for what it really is: an incomplete beta of a game for $60+. The game does have its fun moments, but a finished game it is not. A good game it is not.
---
480 cloth just when I needed to craft gunpowder, the Gods were kind to me...
---
But then there is the Plasma Grenade Plan and Deathclaw Hides so not so much 😢
---
Super duper doesn't work with alcohol
---
Huh.  Won’t let me in. 🤷‍♂️
---
Weird. Im on ps4. Reset and try again maybe
---
Paying caps per each dialogue choice.
---
Just gotta catch it before it dives off a cliff.
---
I would agree its a bug. But I know it RNG, though it does feel like one.
---
Problem is so many idiots one shot anything good if there is six people there don't use any weapon that would do More than 20% damage
---
Killed a couple yesterday in that long mine tunnel with west and east entrance.
---
This ended up being a bit more than what you asked for...but it may also answer a few common questions you haven’t asked yet....
---
Given the various areas on the map are designed for specific level ranged, I kept my camp near where I was adventuring.  Since you haven’t discovered too many places to use as fast travel points, and dont have the caps anyway, having small/highly mobile camp nearby is convenient.  I moved mine 5-6 time before I settled In and build something beyond basic.
---
Open workbenches are rather plentiful and your stash can be accessed from train stations.
---
Generally, the forest (west side map) is up to L20, toxic valley (north by the alligator) is L20-30, ash heap (south) is 30-40, savage divide (Center) 40-50, then the bog and mire (eat) are 50+.  THere are some areas and specific sites within the higher regions that will scale down to lower level enemies.
---
try using an axe or machete for a while.  Don’t require ammo, and are effective.
---
There are several major questlines That start in the forest; overseers (which Will keep you more or less in level appropriate areas), mysteries, fire breathers, BoS (recruitment blues), Rose.  Those will keep you occupied for a while.
---
Follow the overseers questline and learn the lore.  Try to walk most places - you’ll discover more, and gain xp from killing the things you stumble across.
---
Oh, If you are not interested in PvP, and If you havent already, turn on pacifist.  It wil help you avoid accidentally damaging another player, or taking damage if another player intentionally attacks you to try and provoke PvP.
---
Workshops have to be claimed,  If you claim one, you are open to PvP while you are inside the workshop zone (pacifist setting is ignored).
---
Check out Jug on YouTube, he has a lot of
---
tips and tricks for building in fallout games. Ended up building a round house using one of his tutorials
---
Of course!! Before I knew that you could farm legendaries that way I did the same thing. But who wouldn't want to farm more legendaries? Besides that you also get a lot more chems and junk and ammo. Oh and treasure maps too.
---
Alright, you stop that right *meow*. You've got to be kitten me! Killing her would be a cat-tasrophe. Have me feline all bad over Murgles death, shame on you.
---
Good to know it wasn’t just me having this problem, thanks for the advice
---
2000 cloth and 100 plans. Guy dropped it in his locked vendor house and disconnected because someone was messing with him he switched servers. Oh well more for me.
---
So, more a bad tweak then.
---
I think it might just be me 😂
---
You used to be able to hide/extend electrical lines using the rug glitch also, dunno if it still applies haven’t played 76 in a while
---
U wot?
---
But seriously, I agree.
---
How is doing stuff other games do make them greedy? Free DLC cost money
---
I like looking for low level people to dump my plans on
---
Yea. I think they should change it so when a challenge requiring a event to do done, the event should occur at least one a hour.
---
I don't even bother collecting them, they're not worth the time since it's all low-level garbage.
---
PS4 does the same kind of thing. Need to quit the FO76 application and relaunch it to get the character tab back again. Not a big deal, but still an annoyance.
---
No it's a group of kids they have bash my name all over all the fallout groups on Facebook I've been kicked from each one from calling them out
---
Sometimes the server your on sucks like that. You can kind of tell if you've got a juicy bunch of ghouls or not pretty quickly. But when it's juicy, it's JUICY! I definitely recommend trying it whenever you can, it's worth it. I think it works better if you've got a few other people there, especially if one is high level.
---
I have multiple times
---
Which section are you talking about?
---
60 Plasma Cores (100%). You better believe my heavy weapons user made use of those.
---
poor cows, lol
---
Nice one! Thx a lot!
---
Free wallpaper but no thanksgiving event
---
3) set all mobs to lvl 91, and all 3* Legendary...yes please
---
I'm sure it wont have any impact on the economy 
---
/s
---
Yeah, I know that trick to and actually did it last night. Felt stupid for not thinking of it. Thanks though, hopefully others see your comment if they have same issue.
---
Good points, only counterpoint would be on number 2, I can definitely say that is not the case. When I go private, there is nothing looted accept what I have taken, enemies are there unless I kill them, I have left loot in boxes in frequently traveled train stations and it has never been touched. Quests don't start till I get to them, and they never finish early. They might originally mimic an existing world to base some values on, but past that initial load it's a private experience, something I would recommend. I never realized how much loot and enemies I was missing out on till I went private.
---
Survival players want a word
---
As someone who is half the time in photo mode I cannot upvote this enough!
---
Yep! SBQ quest has been broken for almost the entire year from lauch. 
---
I can't see it ever being resolved. I honestly think it's a server issue. And depending on who is involved in the quest! Amount of players, how much they are carrying, player movements, how close players are to one another. These are just instances, that I have noticed before things get glitchy, and soon after the game freezes, or crashes. 
---
For myself it seems to happen every time except the third time I redo the quest. I am sure that this issue has been mentioned at least 20 times over the last year. 
---
I did do a support ticket back in January of this year, and was told it was my internet connection. I laughed, and said that may be a possibility, but I honestly doubt it. I  have over 100Mbs DL speed with a separate USB router for my Xbox. I could see my Xbox one x, being a possible issue. Mind you after playing this game for over 2000hrs, I have experienced so many glitches that  I  believe it is on Bethesda end. Just trying to pass the buck on. 
---
Well hopefully this issue, along with the rest will be resolved by year 10 of this game. Lmao! 
---
Nonetheless I do wish you, and everyone the best.
---
At least when I'm diseased. Kitties are so nice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR2jf95CnB4
---
Same question... what is the big deal about these items?
---
I understand that. Im not defending it, but its not a new practice. Talking about subscriptions. To just rent a server on battlefield is 25$ a month. Fallout 1st is a better deal
---
Funny thing is mad dog is out and somebody is breaking into the penitentiary at the same time to let him out
---
Nope, no locks on anything. I do charge by the hour for my backwoods bungalow bunk bed though. Bring your own sheets naturally.
---
I understand...thanks for the comment👍
---
Nah I just spray with my TSE Gatling. Be quick to get your tags, don’t whine if you’re too slow 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Free states all the way, fight the man
---
whao
---
it’s like an actual location in the game
---
I can never get that event to work, she just says go play hide and seek
---
I’m sorry man ;( I hope those little shits get what they deserve
---
I would imagine you could build a bunch of hp to make up for the lack of armor but the 50% damage increase isn't enough in my opinion to warrant the lack of armor. Some people run broken armor to get the benefits without the protections.
---
I was wondering that, my end number was 302, and I'm fairly certain (not 100%) that I emptied out inventory of boiled waters prior, it was only a few anyways. I'm interested in what affects this, I'm going to have to do some more crafting in large batches and record the outcomes. For Science!
---
My GT is xxXNEGANXxx
---
Looking to do standard or expert with 4 person team.
---
You just add me?
---
The reason I put what I put for number two was because players have reported seeing dead bodies and looted areas in their world. They soon found out that these private servers aren’t private and are in fact used, empty servers. 
---
Also...do you experience less issues in a private world than in a public server? Just curious.
---
I wondered about this as well, but when I crafted the waters I was just spamming A without leaving the menu and it triggered almost everytime. Then other crafting I do the same thing and nada. Seems sparatic, I'm going to have to try big batches of lots of different things.
---
Hence the "they just modified it" part of u/AtophX's comment
---
One of my camps is with Murgle, all cat-ed up, cat lamps, posters and paintings. I wanted to point out the single( unnamed)  dog is very similar to Murgle, good graphics, pads around my house snuffling and scratching himself. Everyone should be able to havethus type of no responsibility pet in game, just adds loads of character to your camp.
---
Yes!
---
When I join an event, like uranium fever, I invite everyone I can to join my team. If you ignore that, all bets are off. Everyone for themselves. I've been screwed to may times by trying to be nice. If you are on a team already I will try to play nice until it's obvious that's not how its gonna go. I dont feel bad about it anymore.
---
Getlike_hmm?
---
The clowder of Murgle is not pleased.
---
That's me 😊
---
Since when did I put the ability to set all enemies as 3*? I simply said for enemies to all be high levels or match your level. Plus your not garenteed a 3* enemy anyway no matter where you go so what are you getting at?
---
Okay this is absolutely fucking ridiculous. 
---
Okay, I am not a fallout 1st member, and I lost all my ambition to play there fucking game. I want to be compensated the same as the fallout 1st members, because I have supported this broken down golf cart from lauch, and have put in over 2000hrs to say the least. Thanks again Bethesda, for just showing how much you appreciate your most loyalist players of your game. 
---
Again just another slap in the face! 
---
I honestly wonder who comes up with these schemes, is it our puppet master God Howard. 
---
In addition, I have no issue with Fallout 1st players, I have an issue with Bethesda and there pathetic, and intolerable business practices. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
It’s almost like it was redesigned by a completely different team who were educated in a different country with different design philosophies but based on the same original platform 🥱
---
Someone come and get their man before he embarrasses himself
---
That sounds fair.
---
Yes ps4 and it's when I die wearing powerarmor
---
4k steel,in whitespring workbench shop, probably a"gift" from an overweight duper.
---
So every company is a shitty company now?  I love that logic.  When people get so desperate they literally make statements that every single company ever existing is bad.
---
Do you blame them?
---
ET Phone Home! Lmao!
---
Not really viable, honestly.
---
You need absolutely 0 DR to get the full damage bonus, and even then it's just much much lower than Bloodied or Junkie's. Even Nocturnal is potentially better at night.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
i will help you out bro, i shall craft you nice weapons and armour
---
I'll join along with ya, stealth melee build though
---
I have not been able to use them for storage for a long time I did try that in the past but I've always wondered can anyone else see them
---
I was thinking of taking a different approach. Instead of high HP, it would be normal HP, but with all the damage avoidance perks possible in place. The " You can't damage what you can't hit" approach :-)
---
Interesting idea around the broken armor. Any idea if all the prefix/suffixes stick as working attributes after the armor breaks? I have a ton of craptastic armor with decent secondary/tertiary attributes that might be useful in this kind of scenario. This would of course be moot once the Hazmat suit went on though...
---
i can help you out if you're new or we can take workshops together
---
You could be right.  The half dozen or so times I've tried it weren't very fruitful.  I know others who swear by it.  For me I've found its faster to keep moving.
---
it's obviously p2w if you can change all mobs level to max.
---
Why would you ever play on normal servers again then?
---
Oh right, only non-subscribers would be forced to do that then.
---
Which model # is it again? I may have its optimized settings.
---
Berserkers is the same as Junkies but lower than Bloodied
---
I think the community is pretty much the only thing holding this game up
---
My first 1k hours I was nice and helpful, then the last 600h it depended on my mood. Good understanding for mechanics can be used in good or malicious ways. lol
---
Give me a scenario and I’ll give you a good and a bad way to handle it.
---
What deal? What are we commies? The Chinese didn't win this war.
---
Why would you want it to cost money?
---
I've already done the Bloodied and Junkie build outs and like them both very much. Both very over powered in PVE once fully decked out.
---
Was thinking Berserker might be a way of keeping things dicey in that my toon could die at any moment if the wrong steps are taken. At the same time I'd also want to have a decent enough damage output to not make things just ridiculously hard...
---
Thanks for the input!
---
From what I've read and seen I get the feeling this will be a small quest released before Wastelanders. Almost setting us up for the main plot. I imagine it will play out similar to this....
---
We'll receive a signal asking for any vigilant citizens to come to Grafton Pawn Shop upon entering alone (Seems the pawn shop is an instanced scene) where we will meet our first npc(s). They will tell us about The Treasure Of Appalachia and the now missing owner of the pawn shop. The notes will point us to each characters last location, and with each we'll find a map fragment. Once we have all the fragments the location of Vault 79 will be revealed. However entrance will be sealed and the wastelanders dlc will be about the factions trying to gain access.
---
Question is...what is inside? Likely 79 is a massive gold depository.
---
Almost like how the Lying Lowe questline, random events set us up for the Sheepsquatch. Or when the crate, corpse and Vault were added before nuclear winter.
---
Is google down again?
---

Hell yeah, add up dude! Drop your name too, I know the add friends function is a bit hit n miss right now haha
---
Think my “add friends” function is bugged, it does nothing when I hit enter. Try adding me?
---
NU6950
---
Thanks!
---
No way. No matter how much health you built up, the lack of damage resistance would ruin you. The damage increase is also quite low.
---
Yeah, a whole lot less issues, it's night and day, seriously. I've fought Queen on private solo and have never crashed or had massive lag spikes, and Vault 94 is way better on private, it's tough to do the timed computer parts on public when it can keep you at the computer for 30 plus seconds with lag. 
---
The part about dead bodies and looted areas, the game keeps record of areas you have looted for one day (real time) so if you play a lot you sometimes quickly go through areas and forget later you have, I do that frequently and sometimes forget I've been there, but it does look empty till everything respawns the next day. The dead bodies, I've only seen this with nukes in particular, cause the nuke kills everything and stays that way until another PC spawns in/out. If I nuke, immediately travel to Whitesprings, everything is dead, sentry bots, glowing ones AND original feral golfers. Its like it spawns in glowing ones during nuke explosion, not after. Way to solve this is to nuke, travel near location to loot, log out. Wait a few seconds, and log back in. Enemies have respawned because a "new" PC has entered loading area. This happens on public too, you could clear Whitesprings and another PC gets in server and boom, all enemies respawn.
---
Multiple times a session I cant stand it. Same withthe fast travel bug.
---
I’ve done it multiple times, think it just depends on whose playing and their knowledge
---
Thanks, I did try Google but the wiki isn't very clear on this. Shame about the 30 very weight.
---
I wouldn't kick it out of bed.
---
In reality events are over in just a few seconds? Ok dude whatever you say
---
Being able to favourite vendors would be awesome 😍
---
Decent is the right word here - it's not a god roll but still, decent. Faster Fire Rate, Explosive, and Less VATS Cost are all good rolls on handmades, and good main prefixes include Bloodied, Furious, Anti-Armor, Instigating, and Quad
---
Yeah, many people dont realy know what to do+ there are alot of high lvl robots and the encrypted robot aswell, i normaly manage to finish the event when i join it with help from fellow players, it is difficult to do it alone or  when Just some players do the events request
---
I think that’s an artistic liberty by the poster artists made to have a way to literally depict the Chinese war machine, referring literally to their production capacity and manpower, but yes that would be interesting to see. Would be funny if it did exist but got destroyed by US invasion forces in China.
---
🤡🤡🤡
---
Free States!
---
Super Duper alcohol should work on Free States territory !
---
I’ve done everything there is to do x50+ played for 1,6k/h and still say this game is lacking, got bad performance and a studio that don’t know what they are doing but just wants more money.
---
I do. Riight now im a melee build and can 1 shot level 68 glowing one's with a combat knife so i switch to a non legendary crafted handmade. I tag an enemy and stand there and wait. That's the not fun part of most events.
---
And yes i can take hits from every enemy in the game but standing there letting enemies hit you and degrade your armor is also not fun
---
- you may be tempted to build for junk carrying capacity.... but keep your eye on end game and builds (will see if i can find links)
---
- nice to have perk cards:
---
  - traveling pharmacy (greatly reduces weight!)
---
  - GREEN THUMB!! (doubles harvesting plants!)
---
  - hard bargain (cheaper prices)
---
  - THRU HIKER (food is heavy!!)
---
  - ammo smith (increases ammo produced when crafting
---
  - SUPER DUPER  (chance to double things when crafting!!!)
---
- good doggy (3x benefits eating dog food)
---
- scrapper (more components when scrapping)
---
- born survivor  (auto uses a stimpack at certain health level.  There is gear that does the same but I prefer the perk card)
---
There are an insane number of perk cards, but it depends on your play style after those.
---
- cranberry relish... see if someone can get you cranberries from the bog and make some, +10% experience!!
---
- if you ever get plans for the marine tactical helmet, learn them!!  Easy to make and find the components  and sell to vendor- I sell these every day to get the 1500 caps from the vendors daily!  I sell these plans on my camp for 3000 caps (2 days of work for whomever buys them! And only a couple of times have people realized what they're worth)
---
- get dirty water from streams if you are about to cook.  SOOO much faster than the pump you can build!! 
---
- ammo... find a type of gun and try to stick with it!
---
   .38, .45, and 10mm are all pretty cheap and easy to start the game with.
---
Yup and I lock my doors
---
Weird, doesn’t give you option to add me?
---
If you run handmades Furious are great. My go to weapon.
---
I feel so bad for folks on console who have picture limits. I'm a PC player and I have literally hundreds of photos, most of them pics from the Wasteland but many are also of my camp builds. It would suck so bad to be limited to 50. :(
---
I really hope whoever's responsible finds a way to improve that for you soon!
---
What do you play on? If youre on xbox use the multiplayer feature in the clubs social menu. I've had good luck with encrypted thos way. Catching a good team on a event notification is like 1 and 25
---
Level 223
---
Time to grief the commies rocking the Chinese Power Armor at their workshops
---
Everything I have is unlocked
---
Get the backpack that's available at the Morgantown airport now. Wish I had that early on.
---
You could use the Stabilized perk for armor penetration, but it works only while wearing power armor.
---
Yeah, normally when you put a name in and hit enter you’ll get the “request sent” popup or something, and that’s not coming up. Tried a few times now too :/
---
Interesting stuff, I think I seen someone mention there'd be a starter quest actually, and this is good way for the devs to do a small test on the NPC/instancing systems. Thanks for sharing this mate, seriously fiending for this DLC and bits of info like this are like a quick fix haha.
---
Tbh its nothing special
---
So doing encrypted, if it's your keycard, I feel like it's your job to manage the pylons/imposter.  Having at least teammate helps tons. 
---
You cant count on randoms to spend the stimpaks necessary for pylons. And if you dont make it, you are out the caps, so it really is on you. 
---
I much prefer running around tagging the adds. Steel, lead, and fusion cores.  Exactly the stuff I need. 
---
So it becomes a choice. Get tons of useful materials, or spend a bunch of stims.  I'm always disappointed if I have to put my Tesla away to help with the pylons. I dont like failing, so I will, but I came for the scrap, not to help you with your mission.
---
On the flip side, if anyone ever says, want to do imposter? Sure I'll grab some stims and flip a few cards. I keep a key card on me for anytime I come across someone fun to play with.
---
I always get the pylons and then the imposter starts to like rape me. 
---
Thanks for the advice though :)
---
1 time I kill it 😎
---
Technically we didn't either but yes, if you want to keep America alive it should be sold at market rates.
---
That update which introduced both has been the best by far.
---
Try these numbers (from Consumer Reports' tv tests) to improve the visuals, not much to tweak anyway. Good for gaming and non-gaming!
---
Leave in-game brightness, gamma, HDR, etc on default, let the tv do the work.
---
------------------
---
Picture Mode: Movie
---
Contrast: 45
---
Brightness: 0
---
Gamma: BT.1886: 0
---
Color: 30
---
Tint: R2
---
Sharpness: 0
---
Color Tone: Warm2
---
Backlight: 42
---
Film Mode: Auto2
---
Color Space Settings: Auto.
---
HDMI black level: Low (so set the X1's video settings to Standard or it'll be tooo rdark, both must match)
---
All other settings should be set to "off" or zero "0". 
---
Any individual R,G, or B color subcontrols, if present, should remain at their default settings.
---
Why no mutations? They’re so useful
---
Backpacks? Yeah, will definitely be checking that one out! That sounds fantastic.
---
Heavy guns and bullet shield. Add some dodgy and you are pretty much invincible while shooting.
---
Nope, just sad player do it
---
sweet I’ll add you now, mines D Earl 007
---
no need for ammosmtih, armorer, science, science master in your main build, those are replaceables perks when you're crafting, get some Stabilized in Intelligence instead. If you plan on using PA ofc
---
Maybe get True hiker, travelling pharmacy, those do wonders for my inventory space at least
---
If my experience of the event is anything like normal, you show up, try to at least hit the legendaries and the one-hit kill guy doesn't let that happen so you just run around in frustration for the time allotted.
---
I get what you are saying but its a shame new players are gonna miss out on the journey for first making your way to new areas.
---
That could be a cool boss for a China DLC for a Fallout game. A destroyed chinese version of Liberty Prime, named Proletariat Prime for exemple
---
Oh I’ve only known the power armor one
---
Oh nice
---
Some people just don't understand how the event works.
---
Others (mostly Bloodieds) can't plausibly take the pylons.
---
No worries, I've been trying to piece everything together. Another cool thing to note is that it appears ZAX and Rose will be getting new voicelines too. Along with the Vault being ingame itself, recently saw a video of a guy who managed to get down the elevator. Vault door is in a pretty big cavern which is partially flooded and filled with various vault-tec and military crates.
---
Super douchy bloody melee/unarmed with every possible melee+damage buff from foods and chems. Queen dies so fast, you don't even see her healthbar regen. It's pretty BS they could've also been using some sort of hacks/exploits. .
---
I know with the stingers you can build cool syringers
---
i did the event and they give me a 1* shotgun is this a fixed reward?
---
i mean i want to sell the weapon but if it a 1time drop maybe i keep it (cries at his weight)
---
&gt;!Nah, we should name it Winnie the Pooh!&lt;
---
People have gotten smarter about nuke placement for scorched earth. I ran one this morning where it was required, but that's not the norm anymore. You can usually participate as long as you can get to the fight in time, no matter your level. Some people complain about level 20s running around during it, but I think it's fine. Just don't waste your ammo on the queen, as it likely won't do enough damage to get loot off her. Just stick around for the legendary armor from the event.
---
I did 2 silos today on xbox with no issues. Private server though. I hope you get it worked out that nonsense is infuriating.
---
Or Blizzard
---
Better than a furious broadsider! Btw drum magazine is 30 rounds, stinging is 35 plus armor piercing you're going to want that with furious. And tank killer...
---
sometimes there are some legendary sm
---
Yet better than 90% of purveyor rolls and much better than scrip.
---
Doesn't work. A 3 man team tried to add me for an event so we could all get loot but then kicked me out. With my bloody built I one hit melee things so I switched to a crappy laser pistol just to get a shot. No matter what, someone would always kill the boss before others could get a hit. Someone was asking them not to on mic, another user was doing the angry thumbs down emote but it still happened. Tired of not getting any loot off the molemen supervisors I went back to my bloodied weapon and proceeded to one hit everything. It takes everyone to not be a jerk but if one or two people don't seem to care I feel I have no choice but to beat them at their own game but that also just  makes me another jerk. I agree with you, not arguing your point but the reality is, even in this game there will always be jerks. :(
---
Instead of 5 for guns, do 5 demolition.  If you have any explosive heavies that is.  Fixing guns to 200% is not a big deal and if you participate in sbq you’ll rack up on the 150% fix kits.
---
In general, only keep cards on you that directly aid in combat, either give more damage or reduce incoming.  Easy to swap cards while in camp to fix, modify, scrap, cook, etc
---
Hahaha
---
True. That trip to Watoga was super memorable. On the other hand, I got teamed by a random at level 42, and got to see the Mire via fast travel to them (I play slowly and methodically, so I hadn't been there). That was memorable too, and now that I'm lvl 126, I spend most of my time there.
---
Oof I hope you didn't renew your subscription just for that outfit. No one knows when it's coming out, BGS never guaranteed something new every single month as far as I'm aware
---
Thats trash
---
I'd sell that for about 1200 in my vending machine tbh. It's just above scrip level but if I was in a pinch for 40 scrip I'd probably scrip it.
---
Could of been a lot worse though at the same time.
---
I've noticed this more and more lately. I dont grind any location repetitively, so it is not a loot reset issue. Not only are the junk spawns missing, but even file cabinets spawn without drawers. Totally without them, not empty.
---
That's a pretty a-hole move.  Especially when her damage threshold is so high, when it dies so quick, not everyone gets loot, even when I'm shooting her with my explosive gatling plasma, I've been unable to tag it enough before Dr. Douche comes in to ruin it.
---
Most likely in December is my guess since we got Riot gear for October and another one in November.
---
It would be viable if damage bonus was 200%.But now it's just ridiculous if you compare to bloodied or junkie. And 0 DR really sucks. 
---
Trash tier build.
---
It’s probably one of or the hardest event.  I won’t attend if I don’t see 5+ level 150+ players there.  You need peeps that know what to do and have some fire power.  I always die so learned to go with no junk to worry about dropping.
---
Waits forever, is only starting 2nd month. Lol.
---
Imo, if you turn up in power armor.....you're the pylon crew. Because the 1 or 2 not in power armor will kill it in about 10 seconds because you can be sure they're either bloodied or junkies builds.
---
30 pounds of extra carry weight. Do the dreaded tadpoles challenges and you can craft one at level 50 that holds 60. Haven't bothered yet, because it would eat up my limited playtime.
---
That's for clearing the prison, not this event. It's a one time reward per character. It's not that great.
---
It would make things more challenging.
---
That is nice.  Hang on to it until you get something better.  Should find its nice on most enemies.  If you switch it to auto and play commando it’s awesome,  I use a primed fe handmade as my current go to toy.
---
I've seen people in power armour corner it, in its spawn and everyone else at the event is wondering where it is and Dr. Douche cornered and killed it.
---
How?
---
I haven't tested it. There are a few older posts you may be able to find on armor to use. I would think sneak and sentinel would be ideal.
---
a ffre 3 star 10 mili sub machine gun
---
Eliminate all those crafting cards. An endgame build has zero space for them. Yes you will need to flip cards when you go home to fix stuff.
---
Sure but these days so many show up it’s too hard to get your tags in.  But yeah, if you got a small number who show up and are cool, milk it.
---
Here’s mine for using Legacy Gatling Plasmas and Gatling Lasers while bloodied.

---
I WANT IN GAME CHAT...for fuck sake
---
What are you even saying?
---
Youre saying its based off Excavator, which it clearly isnt. It shares approximately 0 design similarities, which means that it likely isnt based off of excavator at all. Being an engineer means jack shit when you cant even notice that 2 different sets of power armor are 2 different sets of power armor.
---
If I'm not mistaken, you don't even get the * drops unless it's regenerated.
---
Come fly with me!
---
There are 9 variants in total. 3 normal, 3 advanced, 3 elite. Normal color, greenish, and desert. I'm going to guess theyll release all the normal, then all advanced then elite. We'll see if desert is December. If so, imma guess we've got a long while
---
Might be a glitch or bug. Heard Juicehead talking about this as well.
---
What? A modification is a greatly different thing than creating a whole new power armor.
---
Ultracite is a modification of T-51
---
X-01 is not. 
---
Saying X-01 is a modification of T-51 is just as stupid as saying that this whole new power armor is a modification of Excavator, when they share approximately 0 design similarites.
---
I've lost at least a dozen friends on my friends list to this bug.  To the last it's because they can no longer do SBQ or other events because of strangler heart armor.
---
The only 2 we've seen are both normal variants. Which theres 1 more color of (desert). Then theres advanced and elite, which each have the 3 colors. So I'd guess the normal desert will be december, but we'll see!
---
That's what she said
---
Or a I'm sorry I accidentally shot you  emote
---
I was on my alt, doing that event, level 10ish I was and some douchebag level 200+ rolls up in X-01 PA and kills the one I'm going for and then leaves a bag with the insult bott note and keep the legendary for himself. Like sure, you totally need that 3-5 scrip. I'm trying to actually build my character. I didn't even bother going after the others as he was already there and I still hadn't discovered the nearby locations.
---
I'm game what's your time zone?
---
At the Fasnacht event, I found a bag with a level 45 2-shot Handmade. It was the first 3-star weapon I had.
---
Start working the trade forums.
---
yoo hearing Rose is getting new lines has made my day! Been hoping for that for a while. Surprised that ZAX is getting some too, but there's a chance his lines could be related to a NW update right?
---
And lol I hope no one ever hires Bethesda to design a bank, it seems no matter what they do people manage to get where they don't want them.
---
Read the OP.
---
&gt; I like to save these to complete the stings and things missions
---
You're incorrect stating private worlds are somehow part of regular adventure mode and everyone is invisible in adventure mode to Fallout 1st members and vice-versa.  Bethesda made it clear that Private servers are not reused Adventure servers, etc. shortly after Fallout 1st came out:
---
*"When a Fallout 1st member starts a Private World, a dedicated World is launched on an AWS server. Players who have seen looted containers upon login may be experiencing the expected behavior upon log out and log in. Loot is instanced for each player in containers. As Fallout 76 players know, if you loot a container on one server, and then log out and log back into another server, the container remains in a looted state for a period of time."*
---
They also announced that in a future patch they will enable the Private Servers to be invitation only so uninvited friends just can't drop in.
---
When they use the high fire rate weapons is when it’s bad. Try looking at the SBQ when you have those acid cloud animations repeating 10+ times a second
---
I run it all the time but I always wait until a few friends are with me. I can tank the pylons and run a vampires weapon on my heavy gunner. If I can get other people to hold at least two of the pylons I run my Bloodied weapons and drop her pretty quick. Melee is tricky because once I break stealth I usually die in one or two hit since I run bloodied unarmed. What kind of build do you run and what platform are you on? Remember to use any chems you can and if you craft a bunch diluted stims you can spam them while on pylons.
---
Makes sense for Rose, since she's the whole reaso  the raiders will be arriving. Well kinda... since we're the ones responsible for getting her the ability to broadcast. As for ZAX its along the lines of "The recent new arrivals in the area have provided a surplus of potential candidates. Take extra care..".
---
Because of the way it is?
---
&gt; This.
---
No, not this.
---
&gt;The Brotherhood of Steel didn't exist at the time of vault 76 opening, 
---
Vault 76 opens in [2102](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#2102), whereas the Brotherhood of Steel was founded in [2077](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#2077), as mentioned in the *Fallout Bible*
---
&gt;and the NCR didn't exist for another 170 years, but nevermind all that, NCR RANGER SUITS! 
---
The NCR Ranger suits are just re-purposed pre-War riot gear. Tellingly, the outfits in *76* don't say NCR on them, but CPD - Charlestone Police Department.
---
sweet, I’m GMT
---
hey, thanks for the tip, i’ll definetly use some of the perk cards you recommended
---
yeah it's shitty but if i can't get it anymore maybe i would keep it
---
i give away to a dude my responder fireman outfit and i can't get it anymore.... i'm doing beanstalk everyday to see if i can get the other fireman one but no luck yet T.T
---
hey, i’ve already gotten some from another redditor but if you’re down i’ll take all the help i can get lol, added you
---
I think he means a fatman or a missile launcher
---
You scrap in between?
---
&gt;That being said, *it’s been confirmed that China did* ***not*** *have power armor technology*, *only* America did, this is why the Battle of Anchorage was won, why the Chinese were ultimately pushed out of Alaska, and why America was able to successfully invade the Chinese homeland months before the Great War. 
---
According to *New Vegas*, Veronica mentions that the US was developing the [pulse gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pulse_gun_(Fallout:_New_Vegas)#cite_note-1) to counter possible developments in Chinese power armor. In-universe, it's possible that China *didn't* crack the miniature fusion reactor problem, but this is lost in-game because of balance. What I mean is that, perhaps Chinese power armor suits (if indeed it turns out that they were produced in large enough numbers to matter) were unstable, clunky, death-traps compared to US versions. So less, "China caught up to the US in nuclear power" and more "China slapped together something in a prototype stage" or, as some other posters are suggesting, "China stole some US suits and built around them".
---
So now, if people think Chinese power armor breaks the lore, they can take it up with Obsidian. Which means no one will.
---
FYI, I’ve had some great luck using butcher Pete to start a radio station on my google play.
---
Ooh ok, thanks for the correction👍
---
Yeah, but Bethesda made fallout 76 extraordinarily shitty, it sold 11 million copies less than 4 on launch, and it sells skins that are the same price as full fledged fallout DLCs. How does it feel that retailers are just giving away 76 at this point, and how’s that 52 meta score? bethesdrone ;)
---
Also don’t call someone who doesn’t like bad games desperate, I think you’re desperate for some free atoms to compensate for your mold exposure bethe$tard
---
I did, im on ps4 btw. It surprised me. Two of the guys had the gatling plasma and the gas clouds were visible on the sbq. I didnt notice more lagg or fps drops than usual. The game is already laggy on ps4 maybe thats why i didnt notice it
---
Yep! I recommend glossing [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e0voub/how_does_fo76_justify_a_chinese_power_armor/f8i73od/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), we came to a similar conclusion of “Chinese armor plating on American frames”, because if China solved the fusion problem then they would have had no reason to fight the US over oil. More detail there.
---
Found a quad explosive pipe pistol. Ik it's just a pipe pistol, but it was pretty awesome. Ended up getting a few thousand caps for it too!
---
Hell yeah, brother
---
obviously it's gonna be Fallout 77
---
My bad 🤦‍♀️
---
What? His build is so heavily optimised that mutations would optimise it even further, especially seeing as how most of his perks are just weight reducers, he could equip the perk suppressing the negative effects on mutations, it just makes sense
---
I only lock a few, but the majority I leave open.
---
Nah, Mad Dog.  I get the jail break all the time but never had one for Mad Dog.

In canon they literally are. X-01 was a continuation off the T-51 frame with entirely new pieces designed to address the weaknesses of the T-51. Look up something called “iterative design”. The same way the Dodge Charger Hellcat is a modification from 1980’s Mercedes sedans.
---
I meant foundation actually. The concrete blocks.
---
Nobody else uses Creation because its a Bethesda-owned fork of Gamebryo/NetImmerse.  I don't even know if anyone could still get a Gamebryo license (or would want to) as it was last updated in 2012.
---
There are certainly drawbacks to Creation - but ease of *using* (which is more important than ease of making) mods is a major strength of it.
---
I wish I had known this before I wasted the atoms. The pics showed it with items on.
---
Found several thousand junk where you load in outside the whitespring. Told my buddies to get on quick and take some of it. 
---
Best loot in survival was around 40 each of various chems from some poor noob in excavator. I only killed him twice, and took the hundred pounds of chems back to adventure 
---
Also some random dropped a tse 50 cal on the floor for me which was cool
---
Just a toxic developer.
---
Its mostly people with AMD Processors. Not an excuse for BGS of course.  There is a post floating around out there on some custom.ini changes you can make to not fix it but make it not so terrible if you are a AMD\\Ryzen user
---
Don’t buy it if you want it to display stuff, it doesn’t. I was very sad to find this out the hard way.
---
No, I meant not having mutations makes the game more challenging.  I can see the confusion.
---
I renewed mine last week and didn't get my Atoms until today. I was thinking about submitting a ticket but had not got around to it because every other ticket I've submitted has been too frustrating dealing with customer service. 
---
Took about a week so it might be the same with you, idk
---
Oh that makes way more sense, thanks for explaining my man
---
okay cool good to know, thanks man!
---
Ngl I was worried they'd introduce the new raiders and leave her as she is and ignore the whole part of her gaining access to the radio thing. And sounds like we may be getting human npcs in NW then? Would make it a bit more hectic which would be cool.
---
Not much you can do. One of the many joyous glitches of the game.
---
So my situation is that i got 1st on October 23rd. No payment came out of my account on the 21st thru the 24th (and there are funds) and I have received no atoms. But i still have the scrapbox and private servers. So wth basically.
---
Couple thousand of each junk item, including flux. Got my character banned for picking it up
---
Level 224, Xbox, GT- TheFriskyPete
---
I haven't been charged yet. My account says the membership was going to be renewed on 11/23 but I still haven't been charged. I'm on monthly auto renewal and haven't lost my benefits.
---
You got to make sure your doing enough damage to it. I joined a fight once with a low level and was only doing 1-2 damage per hit and didn't get a drop.
---
Did you do enough damage? Most common reason...
---
Welcome to FO76
---
Ty ily
---
Afaik, you need to do enough damage to be 'eligible' for the loot. I don't know what the threshold is, but if you entered late in the event you may have not done enough damage.
---
Eliminate mob levels all together for everyone and introduce scaling similar to what they did to Elder Scrolls Online. It would open back up 75% of the game world that most players no longer use.
---
Lvl 1 3* Chameleon Sentinel leather chest piece. Very random
---
I've actually been thinking a lot about this the last few days, I think there's a level of it starting to creep in
---
God I hate Butcher Pete. I would love to butch Pete.
---
My renewed yesterday and I got my atoms late last night.
---
Its like dating a super attractive person who is all kinds of fun. But a complete dysfunctional, bat shit crazy lunatic behind closed doors. Its a real love-hate relationship.
---
Sounds like a dps bug. What’s your build?
---
Bloodied rifle
---
I think it has to do with map expansion. I’ve been teleported inside of vault 63 twice since the last patch.
---
Conclusion, as I thought it's not horrible but it's not instant scrip worthy either. Guess I'll keep it until I find something better.
---
I have a Anti-Armor Faster Firerate Handmade and a Furious 10% Damage While Aiming Handmade and i prefer the Furious. Put a tweaked Auto receiver on it (seems to do the same damage as Hardened Automatic but with bonus crit damage) and headshots take things down quick.
---
They’re one of the rarest plans at least as far as I’ve seen, only ever seen them on sale once. You could get someone to join your team that has the plans and they could build some for you though
---
It auto scraps, so you have to remember to not scrap-all until you either complete the quest or put it in your stash unscrapped (and even then it's at risk of being auto broken down if you use up the rest of your acid).
---
You can solo it so you’re just playing with idiots
---
Decided to solo the sbg for the first time on private server last night. She never turned legendary. Tried ft to diff event, didn't work. Standard 76.
---
Do you have +250 damage resist while aiming?
---
I try to make all five of my characters‘ camps interesting for visitors. My main is a medic and his clinic camp by far is my favorite.
---
Damn, I never knew you could do this, wish I would have done it when it was available
---
+50 resist
---
Ty. many people rag on it being outdated but it was like a decade between epic’s announcement of ue4 and it’s actual release so I can totally see what u mean.
---
Lol
---
Also side note about the airport: Small backpack plans are there in chest by responder lady upstairs.
---
Also use concentrated fire 2, but always have
---
Berserker is a niche build but not without adherents. I haven’t done it myself but I’ve often thought about trying it. This post is a great place to start, it can make for rewarding gameplay. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9dqur/pc_thehoboseer_berserker_build_or_how_urgency/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
As the author notes, you can get berserker legendaries dirt cheap. This has made me think again about trying it. It’s harder than bloodied or junkies but hey, I could use a challenge these days, and it increases the tension and urgency.
---
Ok, so you may have to unequip everything, log out, and re-equip everything when you log back in. Same thing with DPS perk cards (Rifleman, Nerd Rage, etc.).
---
Thank you for the advice
---
You mean all the cards...ok, I'll try.
---
350lbs of junk including acid, lead and flux.
---
Also, 4k in 10mm on the ground.
---
I haven’t tried, but favorite it?
---
But yeah, it shouldn’t auto scrap if they’re needed for a mission.
---
And Fortnite has made literally billions selling 20 dollars skins for a game that isn't worth more then $20 at full price.
---
What is your point?
---
No, don't twist what I said to suit your narrative, that's just crap. Waiting for other's to get shots in takes a few seconds, not 10 minutes. If you're playing style means you can't participate in events for 10 minutes at a time then you've got a problem with the way you play, stop blaming the game.
---
Was that taken on Grafton Day by any chance?
---
Text chat please. Area chat is cool but yeah..... text chat.
---
I bought it full price and got my money's worth and more. $10 is a steal.
---
Id say yes, seeing as Wastelanders is coming out in a few months.
---
Just a toxic subreddit.
---
Sounds like you should wait.
---
Batman let's him out.  Like he does with all the other villains.  Because he knows that if his rogue's gallery were ever truly defeated he would have no purpose anymore.  And that scares the shit out of him.
---
Know who doesn't have a rogue's gallery because she puts her enemies straight into the ground?  Wonder Woman.
---
Is he selling any of that posh spice?
---
I think it’s the way that hostages in a hostage situation instinctively work together.  Bethesda is the terrorist hold us all - when we stumble into an actual opportunity to help each other, it’s the natural reaction.
---
I mean, yeah. Obviously, they should fix it.
---
Youre the one twisting words and adding stuff i never said. If you had a little bit of reading comprehension yould be able to tell that this post is about events. I said standing aroud for 10 minutes not killing stuff isnt fun. It does take seconds to tag an enemy and what do you do after that? You stand there and wait for others to kill the enemy until the event ends. You are a fool
---
I didn't think much of it at first but I love vending. My only grievance is that Bethesda has been so cheap in adding new stuff to the base game (especially for camps, it's almost all been atom shop updates) that there isn't a lot of funky new stuff to post. Consequently I only really need to buy from player vendors when I start a brand new character. 
---
It's a great feature, the economy just needs a flush of new items to make it really pop. Especially some super duper rare items.
---
No, they refill in like what, 2 minutes?
---
When we bust into the Dev room with no mods lmao
---
I have a furious auto fixer, i love it
---
I've run into this problem Everytime I do the "One Violent Night" event. Some jerk always one shots the Wendigo. Lately I've started following them to their camps, if they're not a vendor, and marking them on my map and doing a quick silo run just to drop a nuke on their camps. It makes me feel a little better 🤣
---
Ha ha ha.  Just apparently not for me.
---
Supposed to be raider, which did you get from queen?
---
Thats cool and all but anytime i see this the enemy isnt lootable anymore
---
Actually moments later Grafton Day started and i tried to take a picture with the Grafton monster and got killed
---
WTB Lightning claw mod...
---
Well I have only dropped $20 total for the game. So... I'm going to treat her like the dirty whore she is. I've certainly got my monies worth.
---
I had trouble on a server. I jumped and it started working again, however some of the gouls didn't have heads and healed.
---
Dont know what the lightning claw mod is?
---
See but again. At least the cheap whore, you get to have sex. There's a positive. I don't see much positive with 76.
---
This translates to, only if you cheat, and if you get reported with one, no promise that Bethesda won't ban you for it.
---
I used to be that fabled legendary fairy. My friends joked that I pooped legendaries. I dunno, I know what I like and didn't want to bother with trading/selling so I'd just stick my unwanteds in cash registers/suitcases.
---
$10 is excellent.
---
Thx man. That solved it. Hope it sticks
---
I checked in-game and Fallout First, etc., is in fact greyed out for me so there hasn't been any renewal. Maybe have your bf call PlayStation support and have the charges reversed. They're usually pretty good about doing that.
---
That's a fair price.
---
Someone will pay 10k caps for my bloody ultracite Gatling laser
---
I've lost significantly more than that just because my friend crashed. We just need a 100 lb shared stash, period.
---
Glad I didnt have this happen with my fasnaught plans and masks.
---
THIS. SO MUCH.
---
I've had this happen to me and a friend during events like Uranium Fever and One Violent Night at least 7 times. It's like they just keep waiting for the legendaries to appear and one shot them with their overpowered builds. What's so hard about the concept to at least be a little less egoistical and help other players collect their things? At the end of the day, you won't lose anything from switching to your weakest weapon to tap the enemy and let other players have fun as well.
---
One time, when we did One Violent Night, there's was this high level player just camping outside the house for the Wendigo to arrive while the rest of the group did all the work - playing instruments, keeping the Jukebox up etc. When he did arrive, that guy just one tapped it and none of us got the rewards but said player. We were so pissed and he just kept emoting and mocking us before disappearing. This shouldn't be a concept, it's plain and simple trolling. I think it's not hard to be better than that, trust me.
---
Also notice when vats is full, and u dont use the crit, it happens more.
---
Rad Scorpion stingers as well.
---
Ive only had it for about 7 weeks so I haven't seen it all yet. Let alone finished the main quest. It is really fun. I can't put down a Fallout game with at least exploring it all.
---
Ive looked around a majority of the map underneath. Imo, its not in the overworld cell and we will probably need command access. I dont know if that will ever come to consoles in reality
---
There's two primes btw, regular and auto. 
---
There's also the NV scopes which can't be learned from scrapping.
---
This is true. and I think an update to pvp in the game would be wrather nice, after all having the Bounty system i'm pretty sur e people wouldn't be complete Jackasses about it but ever now and then it would be nice to gun someone annoying you down
---
It’s not a glitch though.
---
If you don’t “carry” your weight in terms of damage to the SBQ you don’t get loot from her, just from the event rewards.
---
It’s to stop people tagging her once then hiding the entire fight which was rampant months back.
---
Bethesda truly can’t win with this gaming community.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Running a mix-and-match style character could be a fun idea. I'll have to see what I have kicking around the stash box that could used for something non-standard, but not quite ridiculous.
---
Because chemist and super duper.
---
Not to mention the steel, springs, circuits....  
---
The real question though:  where did the rubber come from?

---
Need I say more?
---
Sounds like your points might be spread around for different weapons, you should only spec for 1. I'd recommend heavy guns since you seem to be in pa.
---
But putting points into difrrent weapons severely limits your dmg output
---
Good idea
---
Don't know if you are running a PA only build, but I cleaned the place with my gunslinger, a silenced instigating 10mm and a full set of shadowed light metal armor. I carried a quad Western revolver too, for a boss, just in case. 
---
Burrows, wendigo cave, sugar Grove... Stealth is key.
---
Bethesda says that a lot. They don't always follow though on the other end.
---
Becoming? It's been a hackfest since it released. All the cheating is why I and everyone I know quit after 700+ hours.
---
The damage boost looks like 50% at 0 DR (same as Junkie), but the lack of armor is the thing I'm wondering about. There are a lot of damage reduction perks that I've never tried to use all on the same toon, so not sure how that would go...
---
Go loot somewhere else then come back.
---
Loot reset is based on how many items you’ve picked up and looted from chests since originally looting.
---
They were added in far harbour dlc in fo4, like many others you’ve just never noticed it due to its level I think
---
Each to their own
---
Quick search in your web browser will show you the glory of the lightning claw
---
It glitched for me for ages too but I went with a team mate one day who also had the same quest and got a shot on his playmates and it completes it for me.
---
I like Fallout too, I've played since 1 &amp; 2. But a bad game is a bad game. I'm not gonna keep playing just because I like Fallout. This isn't even a real Fallout game.
---
How about a "do not scrap" toggle that you must flip before you can scrap any of that item type again? I have a different reason to keep almost everything I accidentally scrap lol.
---
&gt;WHERE THE FUCK IS THE 10% OF VENDOR SALES GOING TO?
---
My wife always used to say they should have had a lvl 999 Protection wandering the map, collecting the caps from vending machines. A real end-level goal, it'd be almost impossible to kill him, but he'd have a bajillion caps on him if you did.
---
My scorchbeasts always drop on me from the sky when I fast travel away. So if I lose I just have to either walk to a new location or fast travel and a scorchbeast corpse will drop from the sky.
---
It happened to me with several weapons and some prime plans.
---
 It's a risk we run, not a problem with mechanics. I know the risk. Recently, I erased a character, and before doing that, I dumped and collected items and materials. Must have done the procedure 15 times in a row, using open servers. 
---
Talk about an adrenaline rush. Shared space would solve it. It's true it would ruin the game for a beginner or a new character, but it should at least be a possibility among characters above level 50.
---
I find the scorchbeasts continue to fall out of the sky, near me until I loot them.    I might walk a distance or fast travel, then there it is in crumpled heap.
---
Co-signed.
---
It would be a small adjustment, but at least personally I have to make a mission of of Stings N Things.  If I get distracted by a couple legendaries, or multitask Mire dailies, I tend to autopilot through scrapping and just give up instead of completing the quest.
---
A little stock of bug repellent is nice to have for Vault 94.  Those mirelurks kings are bastards.
---
Thank you for this!
---
Good to see that someone has documented their experience in this build. Will have to see if I can follow their logic for perk placement and go from there.
---
Whitesprings has two guarenteed radstag spawns.
---
One is beside the golf club.
---
The other is behind the cottages at the little pond.
---
Damage resistance. Different enemies have different damage resistance. Armour penetration perks, mods or legendary effects help bypass the DR. The 18 damage your gatling laser* shows is the base damage, before DR is applied.
---
EDIT technically energy resistance but the logic stays the same.
---
I imagine that would have been a recipe for literal infinite junk since after break down you would have ended up with way more than you started with, damn, that's crazy
---
They're huge additions for sure. I just wish the game was finished before they were added
---
I do, but I keep a couple unlocked by my vending machines
---
I really don't understand why they haven't done this it's been asked for a since launch, duplicating and all of that is mostly under control (which I truly believe that isn't something they needed to punish the legitimate player Base over) and even ntroduced player vending so at this point in time with them releasing the unlimited storage they could at least throw us a bone and do that
---
PS don't make it am item shop thing or anything like that they just need to give it to everyone traight
---
Really? Not hating or nothing, but it IS like the single most quoted line from that movie.
---
The only advantage is you can run cricket's looks. But it sucks all over the place unless you are roleplaying or nerfing yourself. 
---
A real shame. It should give 3 times the damage.
---
Hmm. Must be glitched for me. I'm seeing Class Freak which makes no sense for no mutations and Gun Fu despite you saying no VATS. 
---
Assuming it's not glitched, Adrenaline 5 is a waste. Stick to 1 and use other perks for the other 4 points.  Consider Action Boy and/or Dodgy.
---
wouldn't be nice if you didn't have to trick the game to do it? you enter photo mode, select an emote to photograph and snap you're done!
---
it would be sweet.
---
I love my bloodied melee build
---
Rngezus has blessed you none the less. I try to run all the mire dailies and i havent gotten that or any of the outfits.
---
You’re a liar if you’re gonna tell me the game is perfect and Bethesda is without fault
---
Bloatfly Gland &amp; Stingwing Barb, also...
---
It's pretty silly that the Wendigo Teeth and Molerat Teeth are on the 'do not scrap' list, and aren't part of any quests...and all the bug parts are and part of a daily quest. Derp!
---
I run one toon with berserker fixer 25% fire rate 25reduced vats. All armor is shrouded wood, weightless APrefresh +1agi. High capacity backpack makes the armor go to zero giving your berserker weapon full benefit. Raider shielded underarmor. Perks are same as bloodied commando. No nerd rage. Go stimpacks instead. Its very good build until you get spoted. Chameleon mutation is pretty good
---
Thank you!  I guess my only level 25 weapon just sucks.  I swear my best weapon is still my .308 ... Maybe level 30 will be better.
---
Well, 30 dollars + 100 dollars a year if you want to access to full Alpha. Beta would it be after a significant portion of game mechanics are implemented.
---
...it was very good lol
---
Thicker than a snicker brother.
---
I've spent hundreds of hours with F4 lately but only because of the Horizon overhaul. 1.8 will very soon be released with a lot of new features. The more playthroughs I do the harder I set the options because I get better and want more of a challenge. I havn't had a game that keeps me playing it again and again, ever.
---
I hate if the whore is asking for an additional 100 bucks if i want more fun. I feel cheated...
---
Nah, Dead By Daylight takes the cake. It's full of selfish, angry, and sassy gay twinks that whine about anything you do in game. I say this as a gay man, that they make my community look bad. Any little mistake you do, you will here about it in a message. I only play that game with my friends and no randoms.
---
Its interesting to me how slowly they fill up in camp compared to, say, 5 industrial ones at a workshop. They're full in 5 or 10 minutes.
---
nah you're just a bit big boned thats all ;-)
---
You are so right about that, a certain demographic seems to be the culprit too...
---
This has happened to me also. And those falling Scorchbeasts too. Also, my character was on fire for one complete session - but only when I had my weapon drawn out. Flameboy!
---
Welcome back to the game, fellow veteran vault dweller. 
---
I  left the game as well for about 3 weeks, due to the way Bethesda went about the Fallout 1st rollout, and the state of the game after year 1.
---
 Not that I wouldn't have had an issue with supporting the Fallout 1st membership, it just way over priced, and not properly broken down, to suit my needs at this point, other than the scrap box. Aswell, it was kind of a slap in the face to the community, as far as I am concerned. Considering how many issues still exist after the first year. 
---
Yes you are absolutely right! The game is broken, in more ways than one. I call it the broken down golf cart! Lol. 
---
Also I  will give Bethesda credit where it's due, the rollout of the players vending was one of the only rollouts in the first year that I consider to be beneficial to everyone. It has definitely made the game a little more dynamic, and fun. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
That's not a double edged ski sword question.. be careful answering this one ..lol
---
exactly what i did. Exploring is the most fun. Unfortunately the "Main Quest" is really stretched and buggy. It goes steep downhill after the Responders part. After that it is a boring fetch and shoot. The Raiders and BoS part is the worst. Fortunately you can skip that and go directly to the enclave.
---
Nice! Good to hear a success story. Once armor is broken I assume it stays in place unless you put on a Hazmat suit or PA? I suspected that stealth is key with this configuration as tanking doesn't seem like any kind of option.
---
im still waiting for my atomic shop sumo suit
---
You are correct. Certain things no longer auto junk including things required for the quest
---
Yes that is right but i still play that build with weightless so i can be in chameleon mutation, the best sneak in the game.
---
As other posters have mentioned already, this is neighborly advice but Bethesda needs to balance this game because "tagging" is indicative of flawed game design. Enemy encounters should be challenging enough to where other folks have time to get involved in the battle. One shotting is akin to god mode as far as I'm concerned.
---
Both of the two I've seen were there. I had a newish character fast travel to a nearby player camp then run for Dolly Sods to get it on my map and start Stings and Things. Saw the first one on the way in and the second when I went back to turn in my bug parts.
---
I didn’t say that
---
Get a bunch of stimpaks and a good weapon you can solo it. I did one yesterday it was actually interesting, when the imposter gets close enough to me it would use the headbutt not the laser, so I kept walking backwards when it kept attempting to headbutt me and kept missing just by an inch, while i kept firing with my ultracite gat laser. One time i backed into a tree its headbutt got me, but second time it was all open behind me and I killed it pretty darn fast. The key is to maintain the distance, once it thinks you’re too far for headbutt it will use the deadly laser. But if you’re too close you’re dead.
---
I met a 3-star one today:  [https://i.imgur.com/rlYZqG4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/rlYZqG4.jpg)
---
16-times the monetization!
---
Sorry this is a copy paste but here you go: 
---
two shot gets you 25% dmg and bloodied gets you 80% at 20% health, and that’s not even factoring in nerd rage or adrenal reaction, which I think brings it up to 150% total dmg, but if you’re looking for a high health pool, I’d just recommend going with anti armour, furious or instigating for semi rifles, explosive has also been replaced with faster fire rate now in terms of popularity, but if you’re looking for efficiency go with explosive so you get more dmg per bullet
---
You have to have a team that knows what they're doing. It's possible solo, but it's much faster, easier, and cheaper to do it as a team. 
---
Last time I farmed the event with a small group we averaged less than 1 minute once the pylons could be activated.
---
Have someone take all 3 pylons and use a Vampires weapon and/or spam stims with rank 3 first aid and field surgeon. Don't worry about DPS, just focus on staying alive. The others (several were bloodied heavy) handle actually putting her down.
---
Farm westek (ideally in private servers) super mutants are fantastic for xp.
---
Also each point in intelligence is worth 2% xp
---
Best way to get high intelligence without having to use chems etc is to run unyielding armor, so basically.....a bloodied build.
---
Clear west tek and the whitesprings golf club every 20 mins or so. Sleep every hour for thirty seconds for that experience buff.
---
I also run the silos sometimes without launching a nuke, but I never actually checked to see if it was good exp. I assume it’s at least decent.
---
I'd be all for this. I probably spent as much time if not more making races and other "matches" in gtaonline than actually playing. Something like this in 76 would make for some interesting experiences, especially if they give us use of weird effects and things. To avoid exploitation of any one creation, they could start by just letting us make daily quests.
---
I posted a hypothesis about this a few days ago, and Having tested it I believe found the cause. 
---
It happens when one of your turrets gets caught in another turrets line of fire. It then fires back thinking the firing turret is an enemy.
---
Yes, don't know why. You can't put anything on the cases either now. 🤔
---
Do you have a clip?
---
Well isn’t that mysterious
---
Not me but a friend of mine found a dupper that dropped 6 legacy plasma gatlings and 14 bloodied explosive fixers. Guess who got rich.
---
Is it possible someone was in sneak and you somehow missed them and it was there mysterious stranger?
---
I've never used or seen him on 76 so unsure how it works.
---
I was with a level 522 and got the bar almost to full. At first he was shooting the ghouls off me so I could continue. Then he gave me a thumbs down and shot me with a less powered gun. 
---
I took the hint and got a nice new, but loud weapon from all the farming.
---
I’d like to see a fallout in London
---
Will be coming overpriced  to an atomic shop near you anytime soon i imagine.
---
My buddy and I can do it with just the two of us. I’m a bloodied commando and I rock the pylons. Never takes more than 5 min
---
in a spirit of foreshadowing i would say Bay Area with Golden Gate Bridge and the surrounding Area, with ruins of vault 13 and 15 vault city and hub and and and
---
\-e- daydreaming etc gonna have the same music like every fallout since fnv and gonna be microtransaction rape festival
---
No. Some of us have other things to do and other places to be. I don't have all day to play this game.
---
So they nerfed the best thing about display cases lol. Probably a 7$ lighted one coming soon to a atomic shop near u
---
Was unaware of that. I’ve been in more than enough battles with SBQ unloading hundreds of rounds out my 3* Gatling only to be rewarded with an empty or disappearing SBQ. 
---
Bethesda borked the game. I still enjoy it but you can’t be surprised when people assume a glitch.
---
It does that to me as well. In most cases it's either your Xbox or your internet connection.
---
Sorry no. It never occurred. I was harassed by a bunch of glowing ghouls. Im 40 yrs old, i don't think like a youtuber!
---
It generally takes two days for electronic payments to process. Although, as a payroll and accounting professional that regularly processes these sorts of payments, I have noticed that credit union transactions only take one day.
---
For your normal utilities and things you aren't "late" if you set up the payment before 5pm on the due date. But recurring billing and payroll (and tax payments) must be activated 2 days before. It really is standard practice regardless of any hatred you may have for Bethesda or corporations in general.
---
Okay!  Annoying but I was wondering if I was doing something wrong.  Just did a major remodel last night, and none of my usual builds worked. Got tons more object collision errors than usual, too.
---
This. So many times I’ll be running around and find some cool junk I’d like to display, like the trumpet or alarm clock, forget about it and scrap it accidentally... 😭
---
It is a journey, not a race.
---
Guess so. Maybe they ported out within the few secs which was the time it took to finish the ghouls and open my map.
---
Yeah from this one simple idea it could be endless but I don't see Bethsda putting that much effort into the game sadly.
---
We NEED this to be a priority!
---
Maybe, the thanksgiving one is really nice and was only $3. They need to make all the shelves into display cases and remove the shelves tab. 🤔
---
This would be cool because of all the gangster hide outs
---
A full set of Military XO-1 PA in a bag on the floor of Watoga RR station.
---
they disabled Artillery Smoke Grenades and Verti-Bot Smoke grenades from being removable because Dupers kept using the boxes to Dupe.  I wint explain further but You can thank them for getting our signal grenades disabled. I really liked playing with them too.
---
50 max? I'm on PC and definitely have more than 50 :x I do have to move them to a new folder sometimes though, as I believe too many eventually starts crashing me.
---
At the cost of plastic. 
---
But back then ACTUAL dupes were possible so it's kinda moot.
---
Automatic tesla. It won't guarantee a tag, but it's as close to it as I've fpund. I've even been able to bounce it and tag a legendary that was being crowded by one of these PA melee guys.
---
Are you having fun playing the game? Then you're at the right level.
---
Yes this can go the other way too yesterday i had a 3 star and for 5mins it was sitting there i called out 2 people hit so i went ahead and killed it with melee guys pissed and tse the body because out of the 5mins he said he didnt hear me call it out and the other 2 confirmed i did
---
Or just let us place stuff where ever
---
An inhaler transfer service that cost caps would be a decent cap sink, just not sure what it would do for the economy
---
That would be really cool, don't know if they could program it (I have no clue how that stuff works) . But it's a great idea
---
Not gonna lie I do not like this idea at all. or at least not right now. with the condition Fo76 is in I feel like there would be a way to abuse this system and someone would find a way to break the system and keep a weapon. a very powerful one at that, and keep it for themselves or sell it off. and with the way Bethesda is I feel as if they would give no care into fixing the problem.
---
Good thing i have my light in my case. I was gonna mive but not im scared to
---
Levels after 50 don't count for much. Just give you more time to hone in on a build
---
What about Fast Travel and jetpack AP drain, will they look at those as well? 😵
---
Sounds like a way to introduce a new dupe glitch.
---
I opened a [ticket](https://imgur.com/gallery/s9GJXPS) about this back in March. Support gave me a generic response because Bethesda is just the best and I was never able to get confirmation of it was being considered a bug or intended.
---
Listen. text chat would be lovely to have and with the xbox app on your phone it'd be easier to talk, but  I at least want the option to turn it off visually because I don't want it popping up in my face when I'm trying to do something important. As  for writing notes. I think that would be lovely. Choose the background of the paper with your gift.
---
the Bethesda is an impenetrable wall!
---
Nope my boyfriend and I were playing next to each other and he positioned his character in the box.
---
Yeah, what do you think this is? Canada?
---
I see you got the husky size.
---
Happened to me earlier today with 10k Ultracite .50. I was pretty pissed with myself. Should have just had a friend guard it.
---
I lovd how they recreated the dread of being at the DMV. Even after the world ends...its still the worst place to be.
---
^ this the only thing more levels gives u I’d more perks and a chance to respec
---
Your enthusiasm is refreshing. You are asking for something which is not possible. And if it was, it should not be done. 
---
It's like asking for characters in Mortal Kombat to lose golden rings when they are hit.
---
It compressed as soon as I submitted it, that's dumb
---
I defiantly got my monies worth. I haven't played any extra.
---
Server hop?
---
Sounds good on paper.
---
Same with mine (ts +bash damage)
---
Found what was obviously someone's junk mule, death bag at the 6th green of The Whitespring. My wife hit the take all option without looking and suddenly couldn't move. She looked in her inventory and had about 500 flux, fibre optics and about 2000 adhesive. There was so much junk in that bag that I managed to snag about 1200 fluxes before my stash box was screaming and I couldn't move either.
---
I looked at the bag and there was STILL a massive amount of junk in it when we got disconnected.
---
day one level 60. spent too much time picking berries.  havent even finished the story or the backpack quest yet. got my pink bat though so im doing alright i guess.
---
Food build. With an instigating +swing speed shovel
---
Well on one hand I could leave them unlocked, be nice, and let people take all the water they need, or  I could lock it and keep all the water for myself and  my survival needs  or sell them off for a fair price and make a small living.
---
Transfered 3*QE harpoon and AA25 handmade like this today. I was sweating bullets but it worked
---
Nope. That makes no sense (no offense). I could see having a shared vendor system before anything. Characters have their own inventories for a reason. Next we will want to share perk cards between characters.
---
Not having multi player accessible stashes is what
---
makes this game great and not a Diablo 3 lol.
---
Don't expect news from this guy, it's a spam account. All it's info comes from other articles and sources.
---
Exactly. Its a continuation, not a modification.
---
A modification is quite literally to make partial or minor changes to (something), typically so as to improve it or to make it less extreme.
---
Making whole new pieces is *NOT* a modification, as it is not a partial or minor change. Its an improvement, continuation, anything but a modification. As i said, ultracite takes the core of T-51 and upgrades, adding pieces here or there to make it better. X-01 is not, as it shares none of the pieces, or base, and is a whole new PA.
---
Same with this. Its a different set of power armor, and hardly a modification of Excavator.
---
And example of an Excavator modification would be the Bone Raider or Blood Raider skin.
---
/u/ladydevann /u/valseek
---
Seriously, this is a bad issue right now.
---
You should add in Serendipity to add to your survivability. Berserker builds are a kind if voluntary hard-mode for players, and are only as viable as you are skilled in avoiding damage while still dealing it
---
Heavy gunner is quite powerful now. You can lay down a good dps without needing god teir legendarys. The only problem is you have to farm so much ammo
---
Did that ad nauseam and still no luck &gt;&lt;
---
Two bugs that have been present since fallout 3 are going to get fixed? I am shocked.
---
On PS4 here and yeah happened to me a few times too. Private server, no legs and no PA spawns.
---
I joined it twice today. Both times I had to take all three pylons. I don't know what other people are doing. Are they all bloodied? 
---
Honestly it is not that big of a deal with Nuka Nut and some Quantums I have no issues holding down all the pylons. It would be nice to not do the event with a bunch of headless chickens running around though. 
---
I have also done it a couple of time solo.
---
Double space, just entering between each line compresses it
---
I remember that scorched were especially vulnerable for the 0* star legendary bug back when that was a thing. And it's annoying since they were one of the most frequent enemies in the game, appearing in every region at any level range
---
I don't use PA and don't use bloodied or Junkies. I use Nuka Nut and some Quantums to hold all three pylons.
---
I believe one day fallout 76 will be great i mean yes game not great and sure bethesda mest up but that does not say they wont fix that mistake i dont see bethesda being the type of company to just give up on something i mean its a redeeming thing for them now and they have to make it better so i believe they will invest in it even more to clean the slate. Dont get me wrong games far from perfect but they learned they cant just rush these things they need to take there time thats the most important thing bethesda can do for this new wastelanders TAKE THERE TIME make it good. Dont cheese it up fix the game. Make sure people can test it to make sure its perfect. People will come back see it everyday. Tbh this is a lesson to be learned. But will bethesda just cut cold Turkey??? I dont think so
---
I say this to myself every single queen fight 😂
---
That does sound rather horrid.
---
This wouldn’t be an issue if worlds were constant.
---
I’ll hope I get my Atoms on time, I want to have the Black Bear Mascot (expires with one day)
---
I also found that weird. There is some fun lore about him in the Berkley Spa though.
---
ok let me try that
---
Are we egocentric or is this truly happening? Lol
---
Oof you’ve gotten lucky, I’ve never loaded into the same private server twice in a row before
---
Join the club dude. Me and a few friends who are not built for PvP used to take the plants for fusion core generation but since survival mode going away the PvPers go to town at the workshops (and yes it does tell you that PvP is engaged when you take a workshop, for those who don't know or don't pay attention). We got so pissed off with it that we simply stopped and now I just either craft cores or buy them. One of my friends have 1st so we just do the plants when he is on.
---
Both..?
---
but I want to put the mirror ball inside which is for the ceiling...
---
Yes !
---
Or you could pay attention if it's that important to you
---
Yikes
---
Big brain time
---
Im pretty sure the fireman outfit got added with michief night
---
Brother got Back.
---
I have as well and im lvl 80 last time I checked
---
Thicc
---
This Firemans outfit is an underarmor apparently, Not cosmetic.
---
Gotcha
---
Oh thanks!
---
Play nuke winter
---
The event by Grafton dam is manhunt not jail break that 1 is on the penitentiary
---
Using your own logic you’re flawed, the Ultracite directly adds new pieces to the T-51 while replacing some of the main components. 
---
Building on the same frame is considered an iterative design process, ie the F18 Variants, Abrams variants M16 variants. Dude I can do this all night, I have a background and job in design and Mechanical Engineering. You’re arguing semantics, I’m arguing the Lore as well as IRL design principles. Just because they’re not visually similar doesn’t mean they’re not very very similar designs or one is based off of the other. The M16A4 shares 80% parts commonality with the M4A1. Does that make the M4A1 just a “modification” of the M16A4? The 1911 has 0% parts commonality with the Browning High Power despite being based on the same frame by the same guy, and being very similar aesthetically. Does that make it a modification?
---
They’re all iterative designs based on past platforms and improved based upon the failures and shortcomings of those before it. The lore states as a fact the X-01 was an improvement on the T-51. If you wanna get even more in depth the only power armor in the first game was T-51. In fallout 2 the X-01 was introduced as the “Advanced Power Armor” and was an enclave improvement on the T-51. T-45 was introduced in Fallout 3 and T-60 in fallout 4, both were retconned into the lore to give diversity to in game power armor. The T-60 was a direct improvement from the T-45 while the T-51 was also an improvement from T-45. Just because they look different they couldn’t be related right? T-51 looks nothing like T-45 lmao how could they be based on the same platform. Apply that logic to the X-01 and you’ll see how much of a clown you look like.

---
It’s a real mystery, it’s supposed to proc at certain chance, but at one time it would show up every single time to lend me a hand.
---
 I run a berserkers, its by far my favorite build. It adds a little danger back to the game. I run a stealth commando build. 
---
- I wear a full set of bolstering sentinel, wood armor ( ill explain why bolstering in a minute ). I break it all so i dont have any DR or ERr at full health. Wood armor is the best stealth armor in the game, besides the Thorn armor. When its shrouded, it literally weighs .45 pounds and gives you sneak bonuses. 
---
- On a side note, if you break all your armor, you cant take your armor off, otherwise youll have to rebreak it all. So you cant wear a radsuit to go into nuke zones. Wear power armor and keep an anti armor weapon around in your stash so you can stand a chance. Or you can get a lead lined backpack, radshield, and rad-x. 
---
- I also wear a Raider sheilded underlining. You can mitigate the DR/ER of it by getting addicted to med-x and wearing a high capacity backpack. This gives you a special boost without an armor increase.
---
- The reason i choose to run bolstering armor is because when you start taking damage, your literally 3 hits from death, depending on whats attacking you. This without your perk cards. Bolstering armor will help you tank damage, the lower your health goes, the tankier you get. It will allow you to take 3X-4X more hits before you die.
---
- While your taking damage, your Berserker's weapons will slowly become useless. So what do you do now? Switch to a vampires weapon, this will allow  to keep yourself alive longer as well as reduce the amount of stims you use. I keep 2 vampires weapons on me at all times. 1 is a laser rifle for ranged enemies, and a gatling plasma with a beamsplitter for those pesky melee attacks.
---
- As far as perk cards go, you basically want every card that can help you avoid damage. This is what my build looks like.
---
 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c345fe&amp;d=a72ar2an2pp2la2l71lg2lt2a12ib4eh2l32c72ao0a81sg2pg2ph2pi2&amp;w=&amp;m=1469cf3&amp;nw=&amp;n=Berserker%20commando
---
I run born Survivor to help tank damage as well, i keep a hefty number of Super Stims on me. These used together will keep you alive much longer.
---
- On a side not, my buddy runs a Berserker's as well. His is identical to mine except a few things. He uses bolstering cavalier armor, and also has moving target perk card equipped instead of born Survivor. When he starts taking damage, he runs out of sight to become hidden again. Once hidden, he uses stims to heal up.
---
- I also recommend keeping some phantom devices on you as well and hotkey them. Sometimes things get waaaay out of control and you need retreat. Phantom devices are awesome because they enrage the enemies around you, making them attack each other. This allows you to get away quickly and very efficiently.
---
I really hope this helps you out, id love to see some more Berserker's running around out there. Good luck!
---
When I find this happening to me I usually look around at the crowd and find it’s mostly a group of lvl 39-50’s🤣
---
Coming soon, the universal pack mule (robot of course) to share all your loot between your characters, only a cool 2000 atoms from the atomic shop.
---
Thanks! Sent you a request
---
I believe I've seen them around the smashed up train cars on the south east of the map where all the yao guai spawn.
---
This is probably the best I’ve seen in awhile! How much left of your budget do you even have?!
---
10/10 soundtrack and video
---
Correct. Perks don’t apply to stash.
---
Occasionally, I just restart the game if I've nothing on the server to finish, just a glitch.
---
You can get a prototype hazmat suit near a power line tower in the mire, I only discovered this yesterday. You find it along the daily quest with the non-feral ghouls as stated above, I forget the name of it.
---
I really like the burrows. I don’t know why it got so much hate at launch.
---
Fallout 5: Tex-Mex (or Old Mexico aka New Vegas 2)
---
You play as a raider who grew up in a gang, Azteca Atomicas. Your gang is on a mission to get to Texas and intercept a caravan that’s rumored to be transporting guns, chems, caps and stolen brotherhood tech.  
---
As your gang scouts out the caravan’s location, you notice another gang doing the same, the Gunslingers. As the caravan approaches, an enormous firefight breaks out. The two gangs waste each other killing most of the caravan guards too, leaving only you and the caravan’s leader...Cass aka Whiskey Rose herself, Rose of Sharon Cassidy from Fallout: New Vegas.
---
She reveals that a mysterious offshoot of the Brotherhood is attempting to take over a huge area where they plan to occupy every vault possible, preparing for something big. 
---
Cass came upon a crucial piece of tech while exploring a vault and has been trying to keep it out of the wrong hands ever since. 
---
You are given the choice to help Cass salvage the wreckage and accompany her to an outpost in Southwest TX and desert your gang...
---
or kill her/capture her and bring the goods back to Mexico for the Azteca Atomicas. 
---
The map would consist of Northern Mexico and Southern Texas
---
I think Im abit obsessed with carry weight. So other than Bloody Mess, i dont think i have any other weapon perks. I guess I gotta change that. Would melee attack do better (to multiple enemies at one swing) damage?   
---
My PA charges AP when i get hit, and i have 4 leaf clover, so i was expecting to VATS my way out in such chaos.   
---
I have like 100 cores.
---
What? :/
---
So the whole "open door policy" works when talking to your boss, it does not work as well with a prison. On a side note somebody left a meat sack on my lawn and obsconded with my Brahmin.
---
Wohhh new Vegas 2 taking place in New Mexico?? 
---
PANCHO OUTFITS AND CRAZY AZTEC RAIDERS
---
Been a few other reports that the new Thanksgiving display seems to have borked that.
---
Thats asking for chaos
---
Everyone is bloodied except for the two of us confirmed
---
If you have 254 supply requisition tapes, trying to pick up another one will tell you that you’ve reached your weight limit even though you haven’t. Just another bug. Do you get the message when looting randomly? That might be why.
---
Damnit, I keep forgetting this.  Throw me a thumbs down if I'm screwing this up.
---
Ledge Mothman and alien would be swell too. They are so very rare that when you finally find one, you get something special.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong - but much of Fort Defiance is cordoned off, right? Automated defenses, laser grids, (locked) steel doors. 
---
Insects can be explained easily in the same way that we can justify their presence in our own homes today. They’ll always find a way in lol. 
---
Former soldiers and firemen (etc) ghouls? Scorched asylum nurses? Personally, I’ve always justified their existence within the asylum (and their ability to bypass BoS defenses) by believing that they lived within the asylum before they were ghoulified or “scorched.” I don’t believe we have any sources that confirm that the asylum was completely abandoned before the BoS moved in. Could be that they shared it with other survivors.
---
Edit: The BoS moved into the asylum after the Scorched Plague became prolific. They would have cleared the asylum before moving in. 
---
I don’t think the Scorched Plague was really a thing until quite some time had passed after the bombs dropped - it doesn’t make sense that nurses, firemen, engineers, and even U.S. Army troops were afflicted by the plague unless they were still operating within their capacities for some years after the bombs dropped, either by working with the Responders or the BoS. This leads me to believe that these individuals were living within the asylum before they became ghoulified/scorched (including elsewhere in West Virginia). Please correct me if there are definitive dates so I don’t continue to believe in false narratives!
---
are you playing on console or PC?
---
I got your back. There's a hard spawn of a pristine teddy bear on a bench inside Charleston train station
---
It happens for me when the server lags and I hit Trade multiple times at the vendor bots.  Just exit the trade window and press trade again only once and wait for the window to pop up.
---
Bethesda didn’t bother much with logic.
---
I hate having to ask friends to stop what they are doing to help me. Luckily my buddy does alot of swaps too, and we are both in 1st We need a shared stash/ mailbox something.
---
I made 6 bottles today to fill up the spots in the new display case. All made at the moonshiner shack near vault 76.
---
Melee only hits 1 enemy at a time, can't talk much about vats since I don't use it. I just spray with my heavy guns to take out swarms
---
Yes but it makes sense. The giant bear u can buy at camden shrinks to normal size if put in case
---
With a properly placed stair case, you can make flooring work for the roof.  No sloped option but flooring cant be destroyed via a scorched beast attack
---
I don’t see anything wrong with it
---
I encountered one by there as well when I fast travel, was once when I was under lv40 or so.and it was a boss.
---
it is a feature not a bug
---
There are tons of things players have been begging for since launch, such as text communication, not just voice chat. The 250dr bug, to stop duping, etc.
---
You mean... you do not see the receiver part of the weapon, is see thru' right where the scope is? It's usually fully enclosed.
---
&gt;Pristine Moe Outfit 
---
Wise guy, eh?
---
&gt;Not having multi player accessible stashes is what makes this game great and not a Diablo 3 lol.
---
Even aside from the shitty shit actiblizz has done, diablo 3 is still an objectively better game than this game.
---
These groups should be running the queen in private servers. If you have strangler PA you have a group that can handle her quickly and you don't need to be jacking the stability of a public server.
---
Give it time
---
Nope. This is better. The best one was the original Diablo.
---
Exact same here. Says my next charge will be 11/23. Never happened. Still have benefits, but no atoms.
---
I have zero hatred. I'm more disappointed as that's not the way it works for any other subscription service. It also violates their own terms and conditions.
---
Sure, every level of any gun is better than previous one. However max level of all guns is only 45-50 and that sucks...
---
Yeah, something is very weird. The same exact thing is happening to a lot of people. Support isn't being very helpful about it either.
---
No official word
---
Who mad dog Malone
---
Yeah I'm gonna wait until Monday before I file a support ticket. I filed a ticket today about the free scrap but I didn't lose anything so I feel like I'd be abusing support asking for free stuff haha
---
Bruh wtf are you talking about. You can buy a pencil, jumbo mr fuzzy, camden miner helmet, camden wacker, paddle ball, a magazine, and spoiled costume and head. What jumbo bear are you making up? Because the jumbo mr fuzzies cant be placed in displays.
---
It really does, I love building and wish I could have pictures of all my builds. ☹️
---
Always make sure you are well rested for bonus XP. Also, do the feed the people quests to get canned meat stew. Consuming that will get you another XP boost. Then just grind out whitespring golf club &amp; west tek. Rearrange your perks to get you more damage to make grinding easier. 
---
Don't waste time running around. Get a farm / grind plan, rinse repeat, and you'll be leveling up quick! Power armor and turning off the PA hud is really helpful too since you'll be grinding high level. 
---
Finding a good melee with health regen on hit will save you a lot of resources too
---
Yeah, this is happening to a lot of people.
---
Something strange is going on. What's not helping is the Bethesda apologists who are either talking out of their ass or who are flat out downvoting people to bury information.
---
I could be wrong, but wasn’t the powerful automatic receiver always missing the receiver cover?
---
Oh really. We did
---
Let me know if anything comes of the ticket for the Scrap. I wondered.
---
They are good people.
---
I still haven’t met up with them but I’m hoping (they are EU if I recall)
---
... or you could grab any other plant that can be obtained at any time.
---
I have a decent armor too. I do have an instigating Lever action. Maybe i should use that there. I always stealth my way, but at the burrows, even silenced distance shots alert the ghouls, no place to run away, hide, or a high place to jump so dumb AI cant get.
---
You did what?
---
They said if I provide proof of purchase we could go further into detail but I dont want to lie to support since I didn't lose anything
---
I personally think the interloper is one of those new combined wendigo things coming with wastelanders, i mean they look super similar.
---
Recently or was it a long time ago? It has only been recently for me, and just the one time.
---
Put the golden tie bear in a case
---
👌 Gotcha.
---
It's weird that I'm being downvoted for giving factual information.
---
I don't know why the Bethesda apologists are attempting to block information on a legitimate issue that's happening to several people, not just myself.
---
It looks normal to me, but I can’t check because I have a bug that doesn’t let me turn my weapons when viewing them like you are in the screenshot. I have the matte black on my handmade though and haven’t noticed anything wrong with it.
---
EDIT just fixed it and they look the same except for our different stocks.
---
You obviously have no idea what youre talking about so bye.
---
If it worked like that my challenge would’ve completed somewhere around 800 hours ago.. 
---
Or about 200-300 hours ago when they “fixed said challenge”
---
It was within like the last month or so. I was doing the Stings and Things Daily and it spawned me outside dolly Sods each time but this ghoul Yao was there every fucking time! (Took me 3 spawns to kill it because it was pretty high level compared to me)
---
Haven’t encountered it again but always there’s a Yao gui outside when I fast travel
---
Yeah, Xbox has a set limit, makes me sad. I wish there was a way to store them locally, I've got 2 2TB externals hooked up to the Xbox, so I have plenty of room to spare. I do a lot of different builds as well, so unfortunately I have to really pick and choose which photos I keep. Most of my pictures are with me and bugged/glitched creatures: snuggled up to a feral, high fiving a scorched, "hugging" a mirelurk, love me some glitchy messes
---
Ohhhhh, my bad. I thought you were talking about the weekly. Yeah that challenge has been pretty fucky. Out of nowhere it was completed for me.
---
Santa and elf outfit were in Christmas bundles in the atom shop last Christmas. Most likely they'll bring those two bundles back his year or just sell the outfits by themself.
---
At a guess, they didn't put a version of the paint in that accurately visually represents the mods you have applied. It didn't make any real changes to your mods right?
---
yeah if they’re down i’d love to get with them for a few more weapons, you can never have enough, and i don’t really mind lag, whatever server works i’ll join
---
Occasionally i farm Cores, so at the moment I have like 90 of them. so I plan to use VATS in PA. Even tho i have one of the best regular armor, I feel like id get chewed and shat out withput PA. I might give harpoon a try. I had a surpressers Gattling Plasma but carrying plasma cores with fusion cores takes a lot of carry weight. and I also felt like that also doesnt stop the damn bum rushing ghouls. I really feel like I should try a something that staggers, knocks down enemies. I used to use Pain train... hmmm that might be the easiest way out...
---
Yeah I just finally completed.. I’ve seen many people like just try the pods over and over, but that never worked for me, just i joined a server and my camp was in the mire so I noticed it was a verdant season, so I went there and finally it completed!😆
---
Agreed.  People in game are generally nice, but they turn into animals here.
---
A few weeks ago I did a trade with a guy I had a huge, ugly argument with on this sub.  I was expecting a real dick, but we actually chatted about heavy guns for a bit.  Aside from being long winded, he was perfectly pleasant.
---
Why I ought to
---
I have FO1st and I’m hoping to spread some holiday cheer this week/end when I have off and invite some people onto a private world to celebrate all weekend.
---
(I just hope someone can help me finally launch a nuke.)
---
The time difference is what’s hard for me cause I jump on between 10-11am (PST-Seattle) and stick around till like 2-4pm. For this special time I might stick out as long as I can.
---
Also on PS4
---
I literally had a 5 man premade who reported my name as offensive because they didn't agree with my character picks. Forces me to change my ingame nick I've been running with for a good 20 years.
---
Yes, for my dozen plushies, random sculpture junk, and other various objects lol
---
When I move my camp I pop out my dozens of display cases and put the junk in there before building so it doesn't use them.
---
hey i’m down, send me your psn, and i might be able to help you launch a nuke, ive got four of those launch keys or whatever they’re called
---
Hey know it all. I just bought one. Want a link proving you dont know crap
---
Sweet! I’ve got a nuclear keycard already (someone helped me shoot down the stupid cargobot recently) and I have one solo piece (how many are needed?)
---
I’ll be on tomorrow morning around 10:30/11(Seattle time)
---

I think you missed the entire point of his post. Hes talking about how they can ride the elevator to the 4th floor that is so highly gaurded to each individual.
---
It made no change to the mods. The receiver that previously showed on the model of the gun, before I applied the paint, had the appearance when you/I hover over the "Standard" receiver. If they changed the models to more represent what got modded... first I heard of it.
---
Money is the reason. Bethesda doesn't care about lore. The story is dead bro.
---
Anecdote:
---
Country road (not a pun). Villager goes about his daily things when he sees a man. The man is sitting in aren't with a pile of watermelons, in front of them - sign, saying "3 watermelons - 10 dollars, watermelon - 3 dollars". Villager comes closer, buys one watermelon, then another, and then one more. Then he turns to the man and says:
---
- Ha! I tricked you and paid nine dollars instead of ten!
---
Then walks away. The man looks at the villager and thinks: "And you still bought three".
---
Oh dear, you seem to be getting in a bit of a state over all this, they're just words on a screen you know.
---
Avoid turrets is what people have told me, they take up a huge amount of camp budget, plants too I think.
---
i’m not sure, but we’ll find out, i’ll probably be on at around that time as well
---
At whitesprings train station the bag next to the door I found 3000 frag grenades. Got some good money off of them in the course of two weeks.
---
Perfect! See you then!
---
I managed to find some once then gave up trying, they never returned, night time and while heart quest was running never there, just pods.
---
"Prototype" lmao..
---
Ok. I just checked, they changed it, but u were able to when cases came out. Cause my friend has it in her case still
---
They were once in the BOS and have proper credentials.
---
I [fixed](https://imgur.com/a/uGdpVkF) it.
---
Dodge bugs that eat it up
---
That pretty much is the only valid answer to this
---
yeah, you can believe in them all you want. You don't stand a chance and it's all your fault. You'll know what I'm talking about when you encounter players that don't shrug off damage like that. TSE is trash. Wouldn't PvP with that stuff.
---
Daily Dolly Sods Scouts Quest. You turn in the bloodbug, boatflygland, stinger, tick blood sack, and a rad roach meat and have a chance at a possum badge from it I believe..if you've advanced that far at least. Also rewarded a mounted bug plan, insect repellant, bug bombs, random loot, and xp. I do this one everyday and the auto scrapping of the parts has been a hassle.
---
It had a cover before I applied the paint, but perhaps applying it corrected it never changing before.
---
Suppressors is terrible for damage output.  No better than a non-legendary and the effect on enemies is pretty short lived (3 seconds). If you want that effect you'd be better off getting the perk, which is 30% for 10 seconds.  Again, though, not being optimized for one specific weapon class is severely hampering your damage output. 
---
If full health, an AA, Junkies, or Vampires gat plasma would be my go to for a high RoF weapon. Cheap ammo and plenty of damage output. 
---
Batteries included will knock the weight down on your cores (as well as all other energy ammo) to much more manageable levels.  Probably would be invaluable to someone packing 270 lbs of fusion cores.
---
What pisses me off is fighting the queen, and doing a significant ammount of damage, but getting NO gear what so ever. It happens so often, I don't even bother joining the event anymore.
---
I was going to say this. If we were to search his gross pockets we would have saved a lot of effort.
---
I almost always stick to public servers. Mostly I only use the private one when my heavy weapons character is running low on fusion cores. That or if one of the daily/weekly challenges is something that's a lot easier to do on a private server like taking over a particular workshop.
---
And its both a blessing and a curse, because nothing would make this community STRONGER than better server communications. But adding it would probably bring more harm than good.
---
What this game needs is radio channels in the pip boy like #general and #lookingforevents and then let you create custom ones where you can manage/control the membership.
---
I don't know what triggers it, sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't.  Sometimes, it's there again after a server hop.  Strange behavior, but there is probably a reason.   I use the perk that doubles the amount picked, so that helps.  Just keep trying day to day and you will eventually get some.
---
Lights, turrets, billboards all take up a lot of space.
---
Crops sometimes seem to take up quite a bit.  Also display cases, especially the bobblehead and magazine ones are real hogs.
---
lol, TSE Handmade. Both shots only land in vats SOME of the time or if they are one foot away. Real PvP is mid to long range. You can vats me, you can't vats them.  They'll lol you without using vats and you'll wonder how. You may she's enemies in the forest or fighting over sunshine foods with your Forest friends but You won't kill anyone who has real stripes. You'll miss and reveal yourself and then your dead. Your only tactic is probably jumping in the air and shooting the ground around them. You probably got 2000 hours from using a rubber band while your mom called upstairs to make you do your chores. Doesn't mean anything. TSE is noob trash, damage is easily mitigated. Not like Anti armor, or Junkies or bloody, or Instigating coupled with all three right mutations. Drop the ego and be open to learning something. I seriously doubt you've paid attention to the forums, actually played survival mode throughout it's whole lifespan, or been PvPing since BETA or you'd know TSE is crap. I killed two bozos like you yesterday at the ammo factoy both rocking TSEs. We chatted at an event later and they wanted to look at my gear in trade window. One was Unyielding, the other all in sneak Vangaurd.
---
Seriously. Get on it Bethesda, this guys paying you good hard earned money!
---
Oh dear, you are still a fool
---
Thanks for comment. Defensives are gone, because due to lore '' Defiance was overrun by scorched when last BoS soldiers died after operation touchdown and after Thunder Mountain fell. ''
---
Yeah, don't have problem with insects, that could be like you said
---
There were actualy ghouls before BoS moved in, they had to clean them, it's all on de Sylva's report. And the grids were added by scribe Grant when more BoS soldiers came from c. Venture. So there's no way for pre-war workers to bypass them. No, like I said, de Sylva talked about that situation in her log.
---
That is good point,... As we know, enclave created scorchedbeast for military purposes ( raising that thing I forgot it's name) and sb spreads scorched plague. So plague spreaded after that. And ghouls were turning within few weeks/months after bombs fell, because from fo4 lore you need doses of higher radiation for longer period of time, but Appalachia wasn't directly hit by bombs, so this high radiation wasn't here for long.... But that's great topics for discusion.
---
Nope, your ass makes your ass looked big
---
I've found them randomnly all over the Mire. They aren't confined to the one quest area, or to the heart of the swamp areas. Look for the strangler roots protruding out of the ground, then going back into the ground, forming a little hump. They've been on those more often than not for me.
---
Your point being?
---
So?
---
I'm sure that sounded better in your head but the simple fact I was going to buy 15$ worth of atoms and instead got them for 9 instead so \*shrugs\* 
---
I mean if you want to talk about high priced \*pulls out a starbucks menu\*
---
It's likely not going to happen until the same time as Wastelanders next year.
---
No, all BoS died after they were overrun by scorched, so they couldn't turn into ghouls
---
This could be - I’ve had an automatic .38 receiver on a Combat Rifle register my .45 ammo. Still, *I* could be wrong as well. Seems that occasionally, weapon mods can be applied but... The game says “nah.”
---
Eh. 18 of those camps probably had a collectron though.
---
Same. I think I crafted my initial quest ones, and one other time I found some blossoms, every other time just pods. Don't know what actually triggers them to turn
---
We could if we would search pockets of dead BoS in front of entrance
---
There are still a handful of people, but yeah it is mostly peaceful.
---
Oh I know how bad Bethesda glitches are.
---
This is just one of those cases where they made a change based on player feedback (months ago low levels would tag Queen then hide in the shed until it was over).  I just assumed people were aware of it because there was such an outcry at the time.
---
Sorry for assuming.
---
I didn't count those, but my feelings are similar, like if 80%-90% of the CAMPs have a collectron.
---
*"Would you kindly oick up that shortwave radio?"*
---
I just head canon they come up through holes in the floor or Down through the roof.
---
That said i had a glowing 3 star wendigo surprise on the top floor once out of nowhere.
---
Yea probably because you can get the atoms for it in game in like a week.
---
IVe been playing about 2-3 months and lvl 62 charred and lvl 52 mr gutsies are definitely OP imo. More like they totally ignore your armor and do max damage every hit. best of mirelurks, wendios, supermutants, deathclaws, sheepsquach, I easily mow'em down, but them hell no. I have to land 2 perfect headshot with my legendary shotgun or lever action or they dont stop rushing to me. I think (other than 2 times Ive been killed by a player) I think almost all of my deaths were by those lvl62 charred ghouls. Especially if they are more than 1, regardless of my armor, even in PA. SLAP SLAP and Im 10% HP too... I feel like even my VATs accuracy decreases when i fight them.I read today that you should go for the legs... Ill try that next time i play.
---
My BoS combat armour torso makes me look like a walking refrigerator
---
When this happens to you, does the enemy still show a tiny bit of health and maybe even still be breathing despite being impossible to actually interact with? I get a bug like that sometimes, too.
---
:(
---
I was thinking about the larger changes that are visually represented( drum mag, stock.), Not sure now that you mention it if there is a change in receiver. Seem to remember it being covered or uncovered based on reciever, but not certain.
---
I hope bethesda sees this post, I made it for people like us!
---
1. Be lucky
---
2. Green thumb 
---
3. Chemist
---
4. Super duper
---
First step is the hardest though
---
To clear some confusion, my explanation was that these ghouls would have had access to use the elevator before they became ghouls. IE, people who lived in the asylum when these defenses were put in place. 
---
While ghouls *are* completely insane, they would still understand some basic concepts. The most immediate example would be that they don’t tear each other apart. I don’t think it would be completely impossible to believe that they could mash some buttons, if that makes sense.
---
Not really.
---
I wonder if you could rig something up using upper floors, mats and carpets but that sounds like too much effort to try.
---
could not agree more....
---
Through the power of lazy quest desiiiign   oooooh spooookyyyyy
---
I was running around the mire at night and the verdant season popped up so I went to Dyer Chemicals and some had spawned. Went there again another time in the same conditions and nothing spawned. Went down there during heart of the swamp and at night and nothing.
---
Am yet to be in the mire at night during a verdant season while heart of the spawn is on while standing on my head whistling dixie in the hopes they spawn again
---
 /s
---
Do we get our armor fixed if we die? I dont think so. Thus I dont think they break the armor. Im in PA, pieces are almost full condition, but still 2-3 lvl 62 cooked zombie slaps kills me. If you are cornered by 3-4, ALT+F4 is the best way....
---
Eh, the double XP weekend that was just on made it easy.  I just played the game doing events and went up over 30 levels in my newish character.
---
Do public events, farm fissures for scorch beasts, clear westek.
---
Or just play the game how you want and enjoy it.
---
Don’t get caught up in the grind of being the best meta you can be.
---
so.. use radio channels for communication? makes sense, i agree
---
Maybe a few turned into ghouls and ran off, then returned to asylum after the carnage before they turned feral?
---
Can we make “thanks Bethesda” the new “thanks Obama”?
---
dont care about the caps
---
I think she targets low health people first, or that’s a targeting priority.  So she tends to target bloodied folks.
---
Yeah that’s a pretty guaranteed spawn. Usually a glowing Yao Guai around back too.
