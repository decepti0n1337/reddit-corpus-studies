F76 I get booted at least once or twice a night.spectrum sucks in dallas.anyway welcome to f76

---
Depends what kind of game you like. 
---

---
I have 800+ hours in the game. I consider there to be a lot of content but you‚Äôll always find people who blow through it. 
---
The original main story rushed is about 45 hours. Add in side quests and it‚Äôs another 20. Add in wastelanders main quest for another 20. Add in wastelanders side quests for another 10. You may be able to rush through faster but there are also repeatable challenges and events. The map is pretty massive and takes awhile to explore property. There are a lot of secrets people are still uncovering.
---
At level 105 a terminal unlocks where there seems to be a religion around Zax. Wish you could access the vault in Adventure mode to read all the lore though
---
"BAAAAHHHHHHHH"
---
I liked it too.
---
I like it .. even my level 27 alt character, Silkyclip, never uses her armour. She is a low health mutated build so I loose like 50 carry weight in power armour.  I am not really even looking for it. Just waiting to get the excavator. The ability to fast travel when over encumbered would be huge for me. I hate making two or three trips for my stuff, I didn't buy this game to watch load screens.
---
Just play to enjoy it, don't play to compare yourself to other players.
---
Could you link me a clip of this so I can join in the suffering?
---
The only good thing I've gotten from the rusty pick was a bloodied fatman and even then, that's not even worth it because there's nothing to use it on üòè
---
So it sits in a display.
---
Baah
---
I joined my first session it was fine. Tried a different session and disappeared. Went to my private server and still missing. Tried to fast travel to workshop and says that I can't, because it wasn't found. This all happened today. I've noticed it since last week, but didn't care too much until the score challenge in claiming 5 workshops lol.
---
It's getting really really boring. Every day my tolerance for this thing gets lower and soon I think I'll be calling it quits.
---
His screams were kind of terrifying though
---
If you are on xbox/pc you can get it on the xbox game pass now so wouldnt hurt to try it out that way.
---
Look up nuka crypt
---
Edit [link for codes](https://nukacrypt.com)
---
Bethesda couldn‚Äôt organize a one car parade
---
Yup. That one is the only one worth doing. The lock pick one can be worth it too if you spawn at the locked crate, pick it, leave the server and repeat 2 more times, but you‚Äôre not playing NW then are you? You‚Äôre just wasting a spot in the match.
---
Crossing fingers for that. 
---
Cheaters always runining the game for others.
---
then you won‚Äôt mind my suggestion that legacies don‚Äôt deal damage to players, only PVE. Win win!
---
You know what, it'd be great if you could set a single button that automatically fast travels you to said selected location, like a favourite wheel but for fast travel.
---
As well as crickets and mirelurks. 
---
And even though I play as bloodied, poison resistance was never needed.
---
This is so true! If you take your time and enjoy the journey through Appalachia you'll probably never be "done" with this game, you'll just keep finding more little stories and secrets
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
With diminishing returns, T-65 is hardly worth it over T-51. Really wish they'd give PA some love instead of giving normal armor everything that made PA special.
---
I'm am dealing with same bug, from what I understand the games thinks your not friends with him in the game, and when a friend request is sent in game the game thinks your friend is off line so he wont get it. So from what I have seen you need a third person who can invite both your friend and you to a team in the main menu, then send your friend a friend request and that should fix it, I haven't tried it yet because I cant find a third person to help me with this so try it and let me know if it works.
---
They do publish "Inside The Vault" on their website almost bi-weekly talking about upcoming updates and bug fixes. So they are sort of telling us things.
---
I know what that is. But I can no longer access the keypad. It keeps telling me to put in a keycard, which I already did
---
27 I believe
---
I think it's a secret young people code for drugs
---
Then I must have been doing something wrong, I've been playing bloodied for ages.
---
Because there‚Äôs a reason they were removed from the drop pool and a large number of them removed from xbox? They‚Äôre broken as shit? My suggestion is that they don‚Äôt deal damage in pvp. Only pve. Which shouldn‚Äôt be a problem with all the people saying ‚Äúwhat pvp?‚Äù and the like
---
I know what that is. But I can't access the keypad anymore
---
Yeah... This is an okay challenge, but 9 is way, way too many for NW.
---
Did you put in the wrong code?
---
If so, it deletes your keycard.
---
I know it's a fake (staged) recoding in a video game but one of the story holotapes about when a father was very sick but also insatiable for meat, due to slowly turning into a wendigo, and when his young son comes in the room to feed him, well, you can use your imagination if you haven't already heard it. Pretty gnarly stuff.
---
All these young folk and their fancy self-loading rifles
---
i somehow just got six i lold
---
Yes. Am I screwed now? Do I have to redo this whole thing?
---
Unyielding Urban Scout Chest Armor, +1 Strength, Weapon weights reduced by 20%.  However, not useful since I haven't found any Plans for Scout Armor at all whatsoever.  Did so many Enclave Events.
---
You can only hold 50 because you're on a console. PC can have unlimited photos.
---
Or just buy the one you want for an ear of corn because bethesda cannt stop dupers.
---
How about all of them? I literally lost interest trying to grind this game once I completed the story and forced to repeat the same 8 dailies and the same 8 events, I honestly don‚Äôt understand how ppl can play this game for more then a month
---
You‚Äôre at the same rank as me, and thats ahead of the game
---
and with the dupe wave mentioned in the title, they shall have them. Hell they probably already do
---
thanks for the tips!
---
Long Explanation Below!
---
Well, it‚Äôs situational. Each suit has its ups and downs, except raider and T-45 which are pretty well just stepping stones and not really comparable to the others. 
---
X-01 for blast zones, highest RR of the standard sets and good ER. 
---
T-51b set for general use, lower RR but best ER/BR of the standard sets. 
---
T-60 is a comparable but less effective all-rounder, which is much cheaper when repairing, so it‚Äôs a good set for, say, grinding in lower zone or other easy tasks.
---
Ultracite is a sort of mid-ground between X-01 and T-51b, with less BR/ER than T-51b but higher RR. It‚Äôs also not cheap to repair, but a very nice versatile set for general use.
---
Excavator is very little damage mitigation, but if you need some materials, you‚Äôre wasting a lot of time using any other set in the game. 400+ lead from Lucky Hole in one shot? Lovely.
---
Obviously, if you can get Strangler Heart or T-65, those sets are both superior to all the standard sets in just about every aspect. Stats-wise, anyway.
---
You're joking, right? I mean, you're not wrong in a way, this game is really dysfunctional and I experience a lot of lag even with a solid, wired connection, but if you're aware how people dupe then you know why it effects server stability.
---
Its still an annoying process for others though
---
You don‚Äôt have another card?
---
I‚Äôm so sorry....
---
What platform?
---
&gt; everywhere now
---
Where's everywhere? I sure as hell don't see them raining from the sky lol.
---
Ps4
---
I think Beth already did that with the weekly bullions.
---
Bye Felicia
---
100?
---
Give this man MILK
---
Agreed, did you ever get that VE laser you were after?
---
[removed]
---
That‚Äôs true. But if you‚Äôve been on the markets, the econemy just crashed pretty hard, and everything else has taken the back burner
---
There is an alternative, the other 5 challenges
---
What tantrum are you throwing?
---
Frack.
---
Can anyone on Pas4 save this intrepid nuker!!!!!
---
Morgantown West side of airport can have a couple of radscorps, behind high school can have mongrels. Between Mama dulce and the university can have several ghouls. First circle seems to have very few creatures. Equip the creature crusher perk, you can silently Beat low lvl creatures to death with your fistsüëç
---
I've had it with fo76 long long long ago, the only reason I even play at all it that I have a few friends who trickle in and out of the game. If i am looking for story play i go play a single player game. if i want a challenging and grindy game that I make progress in,  monster hunter world. if i want a multiplayer survival game, then minecraft or ark. 
---
Fo4 had some poor writing an was hard to relate to the main charecter. Skyrim was better as the story was more 'like I even care if you even do the main quest'. Fo3 was decent if you got past the bad voice acting. But all these games were saved by mods and the community taking the pile of rubble and parts and makeing something good
---
Oh my lord. I really need someone to save me. Dear lord I'll try to find someone
---
I haven't touched the secret service or jetpack? 
---
I have no idea about em and I'm level 460
---
So Duchesses‚Äô model does have larger.. proportions right? Or is it just a trick of the eye?
---
get a life
---
Nope. Maybe i will wait for this mass dupe wave to settle then start my search again.
---
And watch your compass for the red diamonds!
---
No, I no longer wear diapers nor do I throw tantrums.
---
Congrats! I‚Äôm still working on the NW winter jacket.
---
God mode glitch for everyone looks like
---
The guaranteed 3* is definately a positive, I didn't know about that
---
completed in 30 minutes but ok
---
Imagine if I had a second account where everything was stored, Hello Felicia
---
there have been dupes that require servers to be crashed. this isnt one of them.
---
usually bad servers are because that server has been up for a long time, or you are connected to a server located further away from you.
---
Heres another this time from the FO76 official wiki and I notice again no mention of XP?!?:
---
Intelligence Information
---
Intelligence has traditionally been a wild card across Fallout games. In Fallout 76, Intelligence assists players with Hacking, weapon durability and in Crafting and scrapping.
---
Intelligence is a measure of your overall mental acuity and affects your ability to hack terminals (raising INT decreases the number of words in the Hacking mini-game), the condition and durability of items that you craft, and the return you get from scrapping items
---
I casually checked with my group of regular friends.
---
I started exclaiming! Guys it‚Äôs here! 
---
I‚Äôm usually full of shit and when they showed up - they only saw the small adds and then kiwi took aggro.
---
We kited it out into the field and our group of four hammered at it. 
---
The fear and adds were unexpected! Our group usually has two bloodied and a junkie. 
---
I run a vanguard tank with vampiric shotgun. 
---
Took about ten minutes. The late mutation and fear slowed us down.
---
Half way through I found out I could cripple that bastards legs with the shotgun and it helped us to pour sugar on it.
---
Great fight and good fun. Most caps I‚Äôve seen on a reward!
---
Half walls exist
---
I am here to save you. PSN ikki_makko
---
It has been established for a while that intelligence increases experience gained.
---
Great work!
---
Christ mate appreciate the top advice, I'm on it now
---
Wow that‚Äôs a lot of downvoted
---
same on xbox 1 getting XBL error.. trying to spit mems at me.
---
Edit: got mine,best of luck.
---
Sorry not there, but you can leave and come back, then launch. Something like 30 mins, and don't leave server. If you take more than 15 min you might have to do the biocard again to get past first laser grid, but all the rest will be done.
---
Ok thanks for the share
---
Right. I would love to have one but can't find one.
---
My hero!
---
I think they mean vertical
---
There are so, so many cool, unique assets in 76 that would be so easy to add to the atom shop and rake in profit on. I'm not sure why they don't reuse more of the new stuff for this. Even simple things like the white variant of display cases used in Whitespring. I saw the WS curtains coming up in a datamine but they're so gaudy.
---
Yeah not looking for "magic" kinda why I am tired of my heavy build, I have 3 brokens or magic that shred everything.
---
Apparently you need to do the Free States quests.
---
Grinding is fun. What do you think you do in this game?
---
Many people plays in low health unyielding. What advantages do PA players have apart from emergency protocol? I know stabilised can be used in PA for heavy gunners, how about vats? We can‚Äôt even compare the ap cost between non PA and PA
---
Sounds like it was a blast for you and your team. I did the "get over here" emote to my public events teammates but they didn't come which is why I ended up doing it solo.
---
I wanted the skeleton suit too but that's way too much for me.
---
Whohoo!
---
I love this community.
---
This glitch happens to me a lot, because I run unyielding, at 20% health.
---
So I 100% avoid dying, kind of hard to do with SBQ as a Melee build.
---
So my suggestion, try keep your inventory limit less than max (without the weight benefit perks)
---
Or, join a team- and if you have to quit the server, you'll get the "join back on team" option in the menu.
---
[deleted]
---
You have to go into the purchase atoms menu in the atomic shop in the game.
---
Hey, thanks!
---
If you binge you can run through content storyline in 50 hours (I play a slower pace)
---
As a sandbox it‚Äôs fun and easy to find people to play with.
---
You do have to work around issues but overall there are some good moments.
---
I came for the game and stay for the friends I have made
---
Yeah. I start wondering why I grind for T-65
---
I had my camp on the road where the scaffolding was, next to the junk pile. I moved it recently but I was there for a long time
---
1 INT = 2% exp. u r welcome.
---
I always join if i see someone doing it.
---
They're so disorganized they still dont have power armor displays. In a game where they sell power armor paints and skins for real, actual money. Being on the ball with things is not exactly this company's strong point.
---
if your build means you don't get hit there's no point in the SS. I also bought the jetpack for like 6 million bullion used it twice and got rid of it.
---
TBH it's fairly useless for me as a run a junkies gauss shotgun build. And it's not often i die.  could have normal armour on and still smash things.
---
I like it too because it has a little more range than the other unarmed weapons. My junkies fss mole miner gauntlet has carried through many a battle from the vault raids to Wastelanders. I try others but keep going back to it. I'd love to see some skins for it. Frankly all the unarmed weapons could use some atom shop love.
---
Yes, that's great!
---
Most bulks actually weigh more than the junk in them, so unless your bundling you‚Äôre sell then this is going to make it worse.
---
So my suggestion, try keep your inventory limit less than max (without any weight benefit perks)
---
Really? So you mean dupers aren't *literally* breaking the game anymore, just figuratively?
---
Fuck, my eyes rolled so hard I think I broke one.
---
I will be testing this tonight with my full unyielding as I still don't believe it. It mentions it nowhere in the official wiki the game itself under int benefits and it also has been stated several times in publications that it does not. I will let you know the results tonight after I experiment with my unyielding set.
---
That would make sense
---
Broiled scorchbeast brain raises intelligence by 7.5 with carnivore, my intelligence, right now with all the buffs my intelligence is 30
---
My last 2 have been stuck, and have never kited it out of that damn Grove. It is WAY tankier after this last update. Really looking forward to the event.
---
PC here, got any explosive GP‚Äôs?
---
Source
---
Gotcha. My neighbor got wife and I into the game and learning the lingo. 
---
I found a Bloodied, faster fire, less weight... flamer. It chews thru mobs but boy does it chew thru fuel as well.
---
I had an idea that they could let us find perk card packs or the coins in game from locked containers and perhaps other sources. Reducing the load on leveling and giving a means to upgrade the perks from other activities.
---
I use unarmed weapons 99% of the time.
---
I dont know how many hours I have in and I still haven't finished the main quest. Ive spent hours and hours exploring, crafting and building my camp.....
---
Pvp has always been a joke in 76. That's because, as desperately as BGS wants this to be a pvp game, they're catering to majority base that doesn't. 
---
So I don't pvp. 
---
I played some survival early on but I got sick and tired of every BS rule set they came up for it. (For the record, I'd want no damage cap, no showing up on the map) I admit, getting destroyed by some op weapon over and over again wouldn't be fun BUT avoiding getting destroyed would be.
---
Once you get a scrap box you can‚Äôt go back ü§£
---
No sorry
---
Ah, what a shame! B2525 fixers by any chance?
---
Same. New to game and this inventory management is tough. Same issue with WoW. My wife is never surprised to hear I‚Äôm out of inventory space.
---
How many do you need
---
Right but from the intelligence boost alone do you see increaded XP because again there is no mention of it in official info anywhere including the wiki and the game itself.
---
If a near long decade friendship ended because of a videogame, I'd be more concerned with the quality of the friendship and the quality of the people in it, more than the quality of the game.
---
I might know a guy who knows a guy..
---
Same. Shouldn't be this much hassle.
---
The decision makers at Bethesda could not be more out of touch with the playerbase if they where a gramophone trying to play a MP3.
---
that'd be a B2590 flamer. it's a great weapon, don't undervalue it if you decide to trade it. don't sell it for caps, either.
---
Does not sound like a very healthy friendship
---
I have the same problem from Spain, hopefully if you get the error many times there is a possibility that the HUD will load with the black background and you can open the map, but since no character has been created the game collapses and gives you an error, only allows you to get out.
---
make a choice.. everything cant be the same...
---
you want to be the meta.. or you want to dance in a tin can with a skin on it... 
---
cant have both.. the game would be boring af if everything was equal
---
Unless you have never traded, you probably have some duped gear.
---
Two shot adds 1 pellet to a shotgun, not a good deal. AA is a solid all around we if you aren't bloodied or junkies.
---
congrats!
---
What you looking for on PS4 ?
---
Sketchy lol like we are cooking up meth or something
---
Int boosts are great for scrapping hacking and learning mods. Sure enough but XP boost come exclusively from the inspirational card/ resting/food/chems and of course double xp weekends. I mean otherwise we would all just run high int and power level to infinity and have no need for double xp 90% of the time I would think this is the logic behind the change for Fo76. I even plateu when stacking known buffs and a certain point it seems.
---
It's a great event for gathering supplies. Even better when you have the ID card.  Marsupial is great either way but you aren't really missing all that much without it in this case.
---
Okay having a problem finding an old biometric card
---
Can we get rid of this? I'm getting it now and I want to find the NPC who recorded it and introduce them to my meat hook
---
Wah!
---
*Wahhh!*
---
Are we doing it right?
---
Honestly idek. A rifle that doesn't suck
---
Not really... Most people on here that I met are bunch of sarcastic a-holes.
---
That place really freaked me out at first. I kept looking for someone who needed help
---
You‚Äôre right, i meant vertical half walls. I didn‚Äôt clarify, so edited to clear things up.
---
If you ended a friendship over this game, you need to think about how you choose your friends and how you interact with them better. Nothing on a game should ever be taken that seriously. 
---
If this ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù was with Bethesda and you‚Äôre no longer their ‚Äúfriend‚Äù because of your issues with this game, then I hate to tell you, but Bethesda was never your friend. They‚Äôre a company that wants your wallet, not spending the night at your house to play Smash and have your mom‚Äôs French toast in the morning. 
---
This game also hasn‚Äôt been out for 2 years yet. Close, but still sever months away.
---
Honestly I‚Äôd say go for it, I‚Äôm right there with you, saved a lot of heart ache haha
---
Seriously, add an alternative so I can do that AND the NW. Cause this guy can't
---
Found one. I am coming!!!
---
Not  t h i c c
---
Full screen on PC is bugged I swear at least for windows 10 version
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually.
---
(Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps.
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away.
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod.
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.
---

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
I'd say explosive. 
---
I got a level 50 AA assault rifle and a level 40 JE assault rifle and the junkies kills more effectively.  (I'm not a junkies build)
---
Yeah this is the worst part. The new bullion system is just a grind fest. I'd rathe the able to trade or vend some of these rolls that I don't want.
---
How do you get that beard?
---
Escape artist, perk in AGI. Go bloodied unyeilding and you will almost never be seen. Armor with AGI +, helps.
---
There‚Äôs already more adventure challenges than NW though. If your argument was to give NW players alternate challenges to do because they don‚Äôt play adventure, I can understand that. But not this.
---
Well, if there's an unyielding set for SS maybe I should start trying to get it... But can you get the SS armor through legendary drops?
---
I only want the jetpack so I can melee hit the sbq before she lands, avoiding that AOE blast attack when she lands.
---
I run 20% health with full set unyielding. So DMG Resist is important to me.
---
Black bear attacks are rare - what happened?
---
We have bobcat and at least one black bear on our mountain property. Coyote as well but they tend to be skittish; ditto the foxes.
---
Probably for the better.  Now they will find love elsewhere hopefully.  
---
Always need to look on the bright side!
---
Your INT is current at 7, the + or - just means that it‚Äôs modified in some way from it‚Äôs base value, so when you see (-) 7, your INT is current at 7.  if you see (-) 4, your INT is currently at 4. If you saw (+) 9 that would mean that it‚Äôs above your normal base stat at 9
---
I crash every now and then, but the more common error I encounter is the 'server is unresponsive' desync during some quests. I don't know what it's officially called, but that error that locks you out of keyboard/mouse controls so you just stand there thinking, 'I hope it's the server otherwise something is going to run by and murder me.' I dunno what causes the desync, but I find that running fast over debris and uneven terrain sometimes triggers it (or it's a big coincidence).
---
Thankfully, it's almost always the server and I simply get booted to the Main Menu. Or maybe not thankfully since I still get short-changed due to not being able to finish the almost completed quest/event.
---
Then why are you here exactly? And literally none of them are difficult..
---
As long as they can have Atom Store-bought skins applied, they will stay in game. That's why the Radicals Mask is literally the only piece of equipment to have *EVER* been retroactively nerfed! It would've directly impacted Atom Store sales due to it filling a cosmetic slot and not being able to have skins applied.
---
That's the reason why Radicals Mask wasn't simply made a legacy item like everything else in the history of the game, but it was wrapped up in a nice "for the benefit of the players!" package. Gotta push those numbers up! Sell the funny hats!
---
Not many players have enough charisma to share that so it's always welcome when others share it. I always check what teammates are sharing and adjust accordingly.
---
No.
---
But... Boo Hoo Hoo.
---
Sorry doesn't work, nor using a world container.üò≠
---
Love that the ghouls swarmed him. Karma for the win!
---
I run a tank / utility / vampiric shotgun / vanguard build
---
I‚Äôm lvl 138
---
It‚Äôs heavy on strength. I run SS vanguard top half with deep pocket chest. I run BOS legs so I can use deep pocketed there. Carry weight is 335
---
I carry a variety of shotguns with the 90% reduction it‚Äôs a Swiss Army knife of fun
---
I have a shish-kabob for healing NPC and make use of every utility that helps me heal or help heal others. I stay away from anything that removes other players rads as not to upset bloody builds.
---
As long as you are firing, you are healing yourself.
---
The only time I use stim packs is encrypted 
---
2 shot pretty much everything with a pump or double barrel. I use other configurations for high ROF Guns that do less damage for when I group with low level players
---
Until you reach your camp limit and have to put a leash on the fun you‚Äôre having.
---
You aren't even joking!!! Lol
---
Someone killed a 1 star legendary right in front of me and I cried all day for a week.
---
Did you each try adding each other on the friends list? Did you guys block each other?
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Day 1 player: Happened all the time in the first three months. I haven‚Äôt had any problems for quite sometime so I‚Äôm content.
---
Leveling up everyday IS the Adventure mode alternative to NW. That's why they give you 6 options to complete the (5) Daily Tasks.
---
Well you have to craft the SS armour and then pray to RNJesus for unyielding armour. Once you buy the plan you can get SS from drops.
---
i just wish that all builds were at least VIABLE. There‚Äôs always gonna be a meta that reigns supreme but right now all that matters is 1) hitting as close to damage cap as possible and 2) fire rate. Throw a stealth boy on to extend the chances of living 2 seconds longer than your opponent and drop a gg. That‚Äôs it. Shotguns aren‚Äôt viable, riflemen aren‚Äôt viable, the only reason heavy gunners are viable is bc of legacies. Like i just wish it could be fun. Or flat out removed. I would like to pvp in NW but i can‚Äôt express in words how BORING battle royales are to me. They could have come up with a fun way to do pvp in this game and they just made a shitty BR that feels like a low budget beta. 
---
sorry for rant
---
THIS
---
So they work on upper floors? Interesting, I ended having to compromise with having them close and lined up with each other but not snapped together. It looks fine but would probably look so much better if they snapped together.
---
this ^^
---
even worse the process of scrapping perks for points is a laborious, grueling slog.  Took me \~15 minutes to rank up 1 perk.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's a disaster.
---
A couple tips,

Loot everything that ain't nailed down. 
---
Scrap all the junk you collect and whatever you won't be using (bad guns, bad armour, etc.) for materials. 
---
Keep all your scraped junk in your stash at your C.A.M.P
---
This has always bothered me. We had them in FO4, so what gives, Bethesda?
---
*sigh* damnit Bethesda
---
Got a link to your build by chance?
---
There's a bug, causing challenges to automatically complete but not give you SCORE.
---
You can complete it within ~7 weeks easily accounting for the repeatable that you will finish a few times a day of average playing. 
---
There is a catch up in the form of joining a farming party and grinding out levels for a few hours here and there. 
---
It is fairly easy to finish all 100 with average play times of 1-2 hours/ day. If you can't play a minimal amount of time, you won't get full rewards, and THAT'S OKAY. You will not die. People who put in the time and effort DESERVE a reward for doing so. That gives people something to strive towards.
---
It took me like an hour and a half to get 8 creature kills. The last match I played spawned 6 creatures in my area after I killed my 9th. Broken daily, the three creature one was way better
---
Intelligence is directly linked to xp gains. 2-3% per point.
---
With new teams option always join a build or event team to max your xp gains. 
---
Do not worry about completing early east side of the map quests. This will frustrate you to no end due to the current overpowering Npc scale issue. 
---
Take workshops for easy rewards. Explore the "forest" region first and learn how to enjoy the Quality of Life aspects of the game. 
---
Ammo is a big challenge in the beginning. Hoard and use weapons that allow u to use up Ammon don't get stuck using a shotgun or lever action for the first 20 levels.  Use all guns but learn what style u like and focus your perk card choices around that.
---
It sucks being over weight with good stuff. Stash and character inventory management is key. Learn to use scrap or sell stuff to train bot vendors. This alone can make u 1400 caps every 24 hours so each week u have potential to make 9800 caps from train station bot vendors.  Caps are key to enjoying your game play but don't focus too much in the beginning on making a fortune. Just know that if u want you can make good money selling to bot vendors. 
---
Enjoy the adventure. It's a good one for sure.üòÅüëç
---
Nope
---
2018 was 2 years ago?
---
What's with some members of this community and having a strong dislike for any criticism towards the game?
---
I‚Äòm sharing Lone Wanderer :)
---
Yeah, I get the same exact thing after about 3 tries to log in.
---
I can help you. Add me on Xbox at Zug Vordanai and we‚Äôll get it done.
---
I like it, and the public teams too as I benefit from being a solo player.  Never paid any mind to challenges, but now I try to complete all the challenges.  Even tried NW, but I don't like Fortnite.  Although, I did get a bunch of plans that I didn't have, so I may try it a time or 2 more.
---
You obviously have not been jumped by a mirelurk queen at 3am wjth volume at full blast. Woke up the neighbors
---
Scrap all the armor and weapons you find to learn The Mods for them. Learn (buy and use from an npc vendor) the armor and weapon recipes you want to use so you can craft new versions of them every 5 or 10 levels and mod them with the best Mods you have learned.
---
 After level 50 you will be mostly using legendary gear that you can mod from the mods you have learned as well.
---
 Most importantly have fun in do not rush to get to level 50!
---
 Explore and enjoy!
---
It‚Äôs true though! It‚Äôs made my game style so much more fun! I can collect as much crap and never run out of things, except lead (thankfully I have an extractor in my camp)
---
Why? It's true many people are getting this error, myself included. Its unfortunate.
---
While we're on the subject, I bought a backpack skin from the Atom Store and I can't find it in the crafting menu.
---
So you read the TIL about the Giraffe used in a punishment too, huh?
---
July was. When did this game come out?
---
Trying to see if its worth it to make new character when legendary perks come out. So basically to calculate how many cards were lost due to duplicates versus time would take to lvl up as I know each lvl up harder to acquire then the prior one(160exp per lvl up extra) and Im already lvl283. But also thanks for the info!
---
I got a b2525 fixer from the Charleston fire station vendor! Them vendors be selling them goods today.
---
It‚Äôs trash! But yeah I‚Äôll take a screenshot later
---
November 2018 was 1 year and 8 months ago.
---
Considering all but 1 challenge is for adventure mode, this complaint seems invalid.
---
What would make more sense is to have every challenge have an adventure mode / nw mode option such as:
---
Kill X number of legendary enemies in adventure OR pick 3 locks in NW.
---
I am here. Stop AFK.
---
Well, I kind of lost track after 450 times in the first year! Some things just never change, it's kind of like living in  Deja vu! One thing I have learned after 3600hrs is if they say they have fixed something it probably going to be worse. 
---
I personally think that the biggest concerns are around the corner with the legendary run, and nobody being able to compete there game boards after level 60, forcing everyone to pay for the last 30 levels.ü§ë
---
 Mind you having your game crash  jurring an event is just there way of saying sucker. üòÇ
---
I guess I have at least learned something from this game, there is no honor amongst thief's. ‚ò†ü§•
---
I wish you and everyone all the best! üòÄ
---
I was doing the quest for Beckett and I was at the near end I look away to get a sip of water the game crashed and I had to do the entire dungeon over
---
Alright thanks! If it makes a difference it only seems to happen if I get killed by explosive splash damage from my guns
---
The beta was in October, the official release was November 14.
---
You will get hours out of it for sure. Your call if it‚Äôs worth it or not. I personally have loved almost every minute of it(minus a few bugs)
---
lol, thanks. I am just not seeing enough points to maximize effectively for all the crap i carry on me.  I guess I could clean chems and food so I can open 6 points up.
---
Move the camp device around till you find a good spot. It is based on that
---
Think about what kind of character build you want to be (full-on melee, stand back and shoot, stealthy sniper, etc.). Understand what is meta now (junkies and bloodied), and understand the perk cards desired for your type of build OR meta builds. That way you don‚Äôt regret not placing points in a SPECIAL category that should have been placed in another category. 
---
You can change perk point allocations later, but it might be helpful to get things right all from the get-go. 
---
Note: not saying you should be a bloodied or junkies build. Those are powerful now, but they could change, and there are other builds to consider. 
---
Use nukesanddragons.com to look at different builds. 
---
Ask here to see how you are doing with your build. You can paste links to your nukesanddragons build to show others what you have and to find out what they suggest. 
---
DO NOT OVERPAY FOR STUFF AT PLAYER VENDORS. Look around. Ask here or in the trade subs if a price is reasonable. I
---
As a PA user i have managed to test this from level 25 Intel to 35 intell and it is definitely correlated. 
---
At 25 I avg. 205 xp per kill and at 35 I get about 230-234 per kill on a 64 feral ghoul.
---
You should of course do your own due diligence and not just trust blind statement. But I will add to the chorus of voices that attest to it working because I have tested it myself also with west tek supermutants. My max has been ~700xp from one super mutant whilst in a x4 int team with Mutation stacks etc. 
---
There are articles (with proof and math) on this very sub from 2018 even, that I found with a rudimentary search.
---
Again if you‚Äôre that suspicious Or dubious then it‚Äôs easily testable yourself and you should do so. Then go and reap the rewards when you realise. I believe I‚Äôm about 38 int when all out and it makes a big difference, but I‚Äôm not gonna change my 10 int special build for more return because I‚Äôm lazy and happy with what I accomplish already. 
---
Good luck!
---
All of them. You must carry enough handmades to apply a different skin to each.
---
6 actually.  You and your friend have been in a love bubble.  It happens.  Transcends time and space so it's somewhat understandable even if it makes you a...........friend of mine!!!
---
oh ok, so I move it to the front of my camp?  thanks
---
Not really. PA has stabilized in intel and that helps so much, that‚Äôs why most people use PA with heavy weapons.
---
I have 300 you can have for free
---
Anyone else notice a glitch in the ammo converter? It doesn't always remove the ammo from my inventory when I convert it to points.
---
That's one high horse you're riding on. 
---
I don't condone duping but "earning" things in this game is just getting lucky with your completion rewards. That or finding something for sale and buying it. You're not really doing anything specific or completing specific and difficult challenges, its just pure luck. 
---
Thinking you're special because you've "earned" your gear is just the opposite side of the same coin.
---
Yes and no, definatly not 1500 that's too high
---
That's what happens when you focus on the negatives and ignore the positives.
---
Take care!
---
Thank you! What platform?
---
Did you leave the airport terminal and then sign out? Typically if you disconnect during a personal interior space it restarts the whole quest.
---
My guess would be if you move your c.a.m.p. unit Maybe it would push you somewhere else üßêü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Edit: cool someone else commented same
---
Damm I wanna do a heavy gunner build but dislike power armor
---
Make fast travel while over encumbered a legendary perk
---
Nah it‚Äôs a just a server wide announcement quest from when a nuke is launched until it detonates
---
Seriously couldn't agree more. I've been playing since beta and have always thought that the intensity that went into the holotape recordings was at the very least a fine solution to having no npcs. The emotions displayed in a lot of those tapes would absolutely not have been done justice if I had to watch them conveyed through the dead eyes of a Bethesda npc. 
---
We also get alot of instances where npcs would just be impractical, like the responder who died in the supply closet of Morgantown airport. Leaving stuff like that to the imagination, with such rich and believable voice work, has always been a plus for me. 
---
There's been a lot of good voice acting in wastelanders of course. It just kinda falls flat since, you know, dead eyes on a character that only sways slightly from left to right and all.
---
I'm not arguing against npcs, though. I just think it's great what bgs did with the voice work to compensate for the lack thereof.
---
Everyone sees it
---
PC ign iCorndawg
---
It disconnected me before leaving. When I played this morning I was out of the building and had to clear out the scorched on the inside again, but the quest marker is still there telling me to go upstairs behind the locked door
---
level up before you go to do missions in the savage divide or eastward..
---
stay in the forest at first doing events, discovering locations..
---
then move north into the Toxic Valley doing more of the same.. just keep hammering events and dailies and discover as many places as you can
---
when you are ready to move on from there go south into the ash heap.. and repeat the process..
---
I would still be doing events in the forest and in the toxic valley too...
---
keep swapping out your armors to whatever has the best stats.. until you start getting legendary drops and to max level gear
---
as for weapons.. keep upgrading whenever you can.. try to have weapons that use different ammo.. and carry something for melee too... ammo is a crunch at first...
---
you should collect and scrap all of the weapons and armor mobs drop that you arent going to use so that you learn plans and have materials to craft with..
---
I wouldnt hit it until you have some mediocre gear and a few levels on you but the Leader Of The Pack event is great for low level legendary drops to help you while leveling...
---
anything on the map in the Savage Divide(exception being the immediate area of Top Of The World) and Eastward to the Mire and Bog can potentially spawn max level mobs..
---
Avoid that unless you enjoy having your ass handed to you repeatedly.. youll need to be in a protective team or have some decent gear and better perks unlocked(aka more levels) before you head out East
---
personally.. I dont do much more than rub up against the early Main Questline missions until I am lvl 50.. 
---
some people DGAF but if you want the mission rewards to be max level youll want to wait until youre lvl 50 too.. again, some people just do them and level with those items..
---
**when leveling up BE AWARE you do not have to pick a Perk Card from the same stat you place your level point in!!** 
---
after you place your point for leveling up you can scroll the stats and pick any card you have unlocked..
---
ALSO - you cant "bank" levels waiting for cards to unlock.. for example you cant pick a card that unlocks at level 10 until you have spent your points for the previous levels...
---
thats my sloppy opinion on early game for noobs in short...
---
There was a glitch and I couldn't get through one of the grids so I had to use the flying glitch to get there but he has launched his nuke!
---
Thank you so much for offering, but I'm on Xbox One unfortunately, I guess I should've specified in-post, but it was very nice of you to offer!
---
everyone is on priv trying to  dupe
---
You may have to play with it a bit to get the desired spot, bit yes.
---
I love this idea but the game engine couldn't handle something that big, shit we can't even have 2 allies at our camp lol
---
Move the camp unit around. Usually, the spawn is at the north end of your circle
---
They are bad but will tag multiple enemies and not kill em per well placed shot.  I‚Äôd call it a crowd pleaser.
---
you spawn north of your camp module
---
Wow seriously guess I‚Äôll get ready for the crashing ty for the heads up
---
I‚Äôve been through the good and the bad as a day 1 player. I enjoy this game for environmental story telling and cryptids. I say If you like Fallout, buy it for that.
---
PA player here, I enjoy my playstyle, it's by no means a one hit kill machine, but having to be a little more strategic makes it more interesting. I use Pain Train to use the PA as a battering ram to stagger enemies, them using fast knives to get in multiple hits before they recover is my usual way of attack. I do agree that there haven't been a lot of enhancements to the PA players, with the exception of the original Vaut Raid Strangler Armor, the new version has been tuned down, thanks mainly to the massive duping of the original causing server crashes when multiple players would show up at SBQ fights.
---
It would be nice to upgrade parts, rocket legs for high speed sprinting using cores as power sources, inbuilt lasers in arms that could be fired along with carried weapons, grenade lock in visors for helmets are things that will be nice to see. But it does look like BGS have decided to concentrate on other armors instead.
---
Bro we would just be using npc with cars for heads. The engine is trash
---
You are thinking of Death From Above.
---
I Am Become Death is the final quest in the Main Story. It completes when you take part in a silo run for the first time
---
Yeah I understand that the game engine couldnt handle it because even starting up a quest would crash the game.
---
So were there randomly there? Hmm I‚Äôve heard stories.
---
You can never fully min/max heavy Gunner without PA... But you can still effectively use them. It's basically the same build as a standard heavy Gunner, but you can take the points that would normally be allocated to stabilized and use them for something different. If you're using the Plasma Caster I recommend using them in Luck to up your criticals.
---
My bad. I usually browse the PC only posts but sometimes I forget to select it
---
If you like full health and hvy weapons, I am so into Furious.  Esp.50cal furious 25attack speed 90weight.
---
Everyone is getting banned lol.  I've seen multiple emails n posts,  confirming people getting banned like crazy that are/were duping
---
Yeah the more I think about the more you would make sense lol
---
yes you can play it solo. you have the option to change it when you first log into NW
---
Don't worry too much, either they made an email mistake or there's a big ban wave coming.
---
same here.
---
I only play casually and it‚Äôs happened to me a few times. I‚Äôm probably three or four ranks behind because of it.
---
YEah I mean I run almost exclusively now with 3 uny pieces for crafting benefits but it just seems to have no baring on my XP whatsoever and I remember this going around one other time and I kind of left it at no INT does not work as it had in previous games. Seems odd they would exclude in the wiki and INT description you know.
---
I like the idea of a bicycle personally. I‚Äôd love to go for a wasteland peddle of a morning.
---
We could arrange races and all sorts of things, as well as build courses in basebuilding. 
---
Powered vehicles don‚Äôt fit for me, but a bike would.
---
I wish Bethesda didn't keep stealing my daily score though....
---
You have completed the last quest for the Main Story. All that follows is the Scorched Earth event which is where you kill the Scorchbeast Queen. The quest will autocomplete when you take part in any silo run for the first time and launch a nuke. I guess your team leader chose an option on entering that included you
---
EDIT: To add you can do it for yourself at any time as long as you have the required items to do so (Nuke Card and Codes etc). The quest itself is complete now and cant be redone but the silo runs and nuke launching is repeatable. The quest is essentially the guide to running a silo and launching nukes. Theres plenty of videos on the subject if you need a tutorial for your own run or you can go along with friends/group to another
---
Not yet, soon. It is on play test servers for now and will be coming out in future
---
Ees not fair, his girlfriend gave up her toe!
---
The game is easy to manipulate because their priorities are wrong. Instead of them fixing their engine and fixing bugs that could proceed to more duping/glitching, they only focus on adding more stuff. And when they try to focus on fixing some glitches, they just break the game and introduce old glitches. It's a whole joke in my eyes.
---
Lol christ
---
my current problem is I botched getting the nuka cola quantum paint for the X01 armor and now paired keycard 01 won't spawn! I've been to stupid kanawahahwah nuka cola plant a million times and have killed all those annoying ferals a million times and the card is never there! ugh. 
---
I've just resigned myself to the fact that I'll never have that paint job :-(
---
It is usually an issue with the SBQ but yeah. The point being that the perk doesn‚Äôt work with PA as it stands feels like PA is being robbed.
---
This bug is 2000% worse than duping!

---
Yes, I'm disabled so I use VATS, which I can't use to survive in NW.
---
Honest to god, I am in 300 plus hours in, genuinely once a blue moon I crash. Usualy  I Play after midnight till sunrise in Europe so maybe that's why.
---
This is exactly my experience so far.
---
Not really.  You work hard getting legendary items , you cash them in, you go to the purveyor and cross your fingers.  It is a little bit like gambling.  You have bad luck and bad luck and then the day you roll something awesome.  Is a great feeling
---
Example, last week i had rolled 5x3* crap weapons.  With 52 left i thought what the hell and rolled a 2* Gatling Laser B25.
---
I then swapped that for flux with someone so myself and my friend could kit out our power armors
---
So it was great getting a good roll, great finding a trade and great getting 2 sets of power armor upgraded.... this is part of what makes the game fun
---
Duping something and swapping it for duped something else isnt the same.  You miss the  roller coaster emotional ride and sense of achievement
---
It's a fixed reward list. You should be able to find them for cheap from other players. If you're just looking for scrip there are plenty of ways to earn that through regular play.
---
Wait how does that happen?
---
So maybe my berry mentats and uny pieces just are not enough to make a difference while crafting when I most commonly track it. It also just seemed to odd that it is never mentioned and like I said we have so many xp buff items despite having INT buffing items.
---
" Some players are loading in a lot earlier than other players. Make everyone load in at the same time again like it used to be! "  
---
Totally. i can say this makes a lot of difference as a player who used to play with an HDD and then upgraded for an SSD
---
Definitely didn't block each other we don't appear on one another's ingame friends list,so we can't invite.
---
I jumped on FB market just now ppl saying they can‚Äôt dupe anymore , everyone is asking hey can you still dupe a lot ppl saying they can‚Äôt anymore.
---
What kind of outfit/weapon do you use? And what's your favourite faction? You could always try to think of something connected to that
---
You could set up a military or responder's outpost, or a free states bunker kind of thing with the metal walls, a Mothman cultist camp, or a garage/repair shop for robots and cars
---
Just pick something that interests you and go from there :)
---
For sure but the reason I would like a powered vehicle is because I would like to replace fast traveling (though I love fast traveling because I have been playing the fallout franchise my whole life) I would rather be going around in a vehicle to kill the scorchbeast queen lol
---
Plus Player kills Experience are a joke. You get more experience from just going AFK in a bush...
---
You mean coitus?
---
it will work.. it isnt unheard of
---
Honestly it's the only way to even attempt it!
---
Man I wish I can upvote this to top. This is amazing advice =)
---
You are a god thank you
---
You are correct.  My apologies for the misinformation.
---
Unfortunately the lore wouldn't allow for it. This would chronologically be the earliest game? ( Correct me if I'm wrong) What I would have given for an ATV in NV.
---
It is a great gun, but it will cost in ammo. It could burn 5k rounds in 2 minutes or even less when farming. The other problem is the magazine size, it's rather limited compared to others, like, let's say the gatling laser, so you will find yourself reloading every 5 seconds or so. Personally, i would go with either a Minigun or a 50. call, if you prefer energy you could go with Gatling Plasma and Gatling Laser
---
If you here for long term and like burning money in atom store but the 12 month pack
---
It doesn't? Well shit that's what I was planning on buying...
---
What‚Äôs your psn ?
---
It has to be something with this version of the game. None of the DNS fixes and whatnot work.
---
Yes! You go out like Rambo, kill 10 players and that gives you little XP. You hide in a bush and go AFK and you gain lots of XP.
---
pretty sure at this point that this is an issue with the game trying to connect to the bethesda.net launcher even though it doesn't exist being on the windows store game pass.
---
Limited supply model a l√° Supreme, limited Nike Drops, hypebeast culture. I‚Äôm into it. If everything were available then nothing would be special.
---
... Oh my, what happens?
---
I have a full health shotty build.  Use medic pump n a gauss shotgun. My carry weight is 315... but I use a chemist backpack, to use this 3 points for more dmg. Still use 3 points for thru-hiker. Plus I'm very tanky, no PA
---
i have tried every fix and nothing works, hopefully it gets fixed soon
---
my B FFR 1agi handmade says different
---
The solution to being an apex predator by being a high level is not to make it so that everything scales up constantly. 
---
There are plenty of situations where even high level players might want the refuge of a low level area. If for nothing else than the entire map not feeling "samey". 
---
I feel like it's a cheap and dirty hotfix to actual content that challenges these players. 
---
Especially since it's the odd paradox of wanting a challenge but always taking the easiest route available. 
---
Namely that the challenges must be imposed on them. 
---
It draws in the low level players giving them unfettered access to all areas immediately. And allows the longest term players. Likely the population where all the repeat cash whales reside the same. 
---
I sincerely hope I'm just misinformed though
---
I guess bethesda loves you more
---
Yup. I understand your reticence but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs easy to test unlike a lot of complex stuff that usually crops up in situations like this where you have to take someone‚Äôs word for it. 
---
And because it‚Äôs so easy to test, literally everyone saying it‚Äôs a thing with no one chiming in with the internet favourite ‚Äúwell ackhhtually‚Äù should speak volumes üòÅ
---
Whack something naked, then kill the same thing and same level with no other buffs besides unyielding armor buffs. 
---
Should be enough to see a difference. To be honest you only notice the difference when you really go for it, as otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to catch your eye if you weren‚Äôt explicitly looking for it in the past.
---
Since this new grind people are definitely checking it out and going for it and it‚Äôs highly noticeable when you‚Äôre grinding that repeatable.
---
I'll probably stick to the lmg know of any ammo farming strats
---
Could be it, but you'd think if that were the case there would be more people having the issue. You'd also think that Bethesda would have thought of that ahead of time, but this is Bethesda we're talking about, so who knows? I just hope it gets fixed soon, I was looking forward to giving the game a try.
---
But im happy you got something good, gives me hope for tomorrow.
---
I really don't get the "You just want to unlock everything in a week" crowd, we have been playing this game since launch and crap gets worse
---
This video shows it. Skip ahead to about 2 minutes and see what happens when he switches from Unyielding to Power Armor. INT boosts XP and there is no cap.
---
https://youtu.be/QjX5sgjXuz0
---
Well sometimes duping hurts the players that don‚Äôt dupe, like when the vendors were shut down for awhile
---
Yes its 2% per point -source put unyielding on kill something take it off kill something...test done
---
Oh. Sad day
---
Also just to toss this out - egg head serum hugely bumps intelligence with only -1 to strength
---
its only to make me stay in this abusive relationship, by being so kind so they can go back to kicking me in the nards
---
After so many useless 3\* weapons that I could do nothing with but scrip them, I quit buying them and just started buying modules from the Purveyor.  I would definitely like to see the modules included in the sale.  They are the only thing worth buying.
---
Dice and EA would like to to speak to you regarding their handling of BF5. Was it good at release, mmyeah. Is it worse now, for sure.
---
also lot of new players which means more worlds are being generated. And people leave worlds.
---
oh, thanks
---
There‚Äôs a setting to change it‚Äôs transparency all the way to zero. There are occasional bugs where settings just default to weird things. Sounds like that.
---
It seems pretty difficult to do honestly that‚Äôs why most avoid it, especially on games where it‚Äôs all server side and has to be synced up constantly with each player.
---
I remember dayz wanting to do it and it was an unmitigated disaster. Furthest they got was bikes and even they were laggy and crap mostly üòÅ
---
There are a lot of bikes laying about, I can fix a power plant so could fix one of those bikes up.
---
Most people who take part of duping, whether it be doing or buying, think they are something special, at least that has been my experience. In my opinion they are not. 
---
Sure it is luck, but you do earn things by playing the game. If you never did an event or the story and just sat at your camp asking for things, that would be not earning a thing. By deciding to go out into the wasteland and play the game and kill enemies, you are earning your rewards. Also, I never said I was special, but if having morals and manners in both real life and online make me that, then so be it. I would rather be ‚Äúspecial‚Äù then a cheat.
---
Add this option to Fallout 1st.
---
Also add Ammo can that holds unlimited ammo
---
Also let us move vendors without re-adding items to them.
---
Also let our vendors be tied together.
---
I'm new, this is my first couple of weeks. I'm not really enjoying the game, but........... something. It wouldn't bring me back If I had stopped, but it's a nice bonus.
---
Or when new additions to the game become character bound and non-tradeable.
---
Can I pay 29.99 to force people to listen to my bagpipes?
---
It's trivially easy to test for yourself that INT does in fact affect exp. There are also numerous simple INT boosts: Aster tea, brain fungus soup, tato flower tea, brain bombs, broiled scorchbeast brain, mentats, berry mentats, daddy-o, x-cell, the list goes on and on...

Mine have retreated to safety they've been kicked do hard today
---
Spoilers sweetie
---
Makes sense ty for the help it just feels so lonely lol
---
Fucking thank you. I think a lot of the bad opinions on the game would change if people thought of 76 as a Fallout themed amusement park kind of like West World...oh shit, wait a second, I wonder if that‚Äôs why they got the WW folks. 
---
...anyway, yeah, make the game what you want. I‚Äôve been playing for a year now and I just hit level 41 because I play out of order
---
You cant get fixers from the queen lol
---
Same as Reddit Anaujiram51
---
Think we found a duper!

But do continue to tell me what I should or shouldn't care about, I'm very interested.

If it wasn't locked it was probably me. 
---
I never pick locks, but if its open it's fair game... then again also only if its .45 or plasma cartridges. I don't use anything else. lol
---
limits exist in other games and there are limits for a reason
---
The thing is even if using it as they originally intended as a dumping point after each session (which i do) its STILL clunky as fuck to use on small amounts too.
---
It what seem to work with Bethesda the more brouhaha we make of this the more likely they will consider it 
---
It work for the original legendary perks and for the ammo converter they just released lol
---
I don't want to know what kind of bugs they'd introduce into that one
---
[ammo/lead farming guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c7frpq/my_ammolead_farming_guide/)
---
That guide is quite helpful for the resource of making ammo, you could get even more with ammosmith and super duper perks while creating ammo.
---
Another posibility could be the Converted Munitions Factory in the north/north-east side of the map near Bailey family cabin. You could make ammo here with the ammo producer. 
---
Another way could also be grinding raider reputation for the ammunition maker.
---
I've seen the double block happen recently. Crazy though. I hope you get it sorted. What system are you on?
---
Lvl 130ish here and have no clue about legendary modules.
---
Really? I sent in a combined total of 23 support tickets related to the SCORE bug that happened this week and all I ever got back was "We are aware of this issue and are working on it". Still not fixed, no conciliatory Score or atoms awarded
---
Holy crap, someone just bought all my Psycho. The whole lot, at 50 caps apiece.
---
I don't even care if they're going to resell it, I'm loaded now!
---
Its not really amusing, but I've definitely been desensitized to it. I more or less just shake head, stand up grab a coffee or a water. Maybe I will boot the game up again, maybe another.
---
How do you do that
---
high INT is in fact the new meta to grind the SCORE system
---
This is not "same game engine from 15+ years ago." It cannot be, because the original Gamebryo engine did not support multiplayer. It had no netcode, and world processing literally rested on the player character object.
---
Game engines are not monolithic entities that you use as-is or toss out and replace as a whole. They're a package of various components that get updated and changed out over time. Fallout 76 has a new renderer, a new lighting system, and (obviously) a massive overhaul to support a client/server configuration. Even for something widely used, like the Unreal Engine, going from 3 to 4 is not a "new engine." It's just a major version rev from 3.x.x to 4.x.x.
---
Bethesda's engine does have a ton of issues, but they're because of design problems, not age.
---
Whoa, haven‚Äôt touched the converter in a few days, that‚Äôs an insane increase but my mental health definitely can‚Äôt handle clicking through the menus that many times
---
It's probably true for many people, but the fact that they stuck to this model shows that the data says the majority would disagree. It started out with a fully populated atom shop, then they had a handful of limited time items, and soon they transitioned to a full on vault cycle. Must be making more money than the original idea
---
My current setup has me running gatling gun for day to day and lmg for boss / just gotta die now fights. Much fun.
---
Hey thanks, I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off lol!
---
Listen and look for holotapes. Read terminals. Melee weapon to conserve ammo.
---
Anti Armor Fat man ... a true reflection of my purveyor luck since I started.
---
Just convert mini nukes and missiles only and you might survive
---
The reality is any time they have a major updated with added content there will likely be a new form of currency to go along with it.
---
I played Neverwinter for a few years and sure as death and taxes every time a new module dropped there was at least 1 new currency tied to it sometimes more. It's kinda how MMO's go as far as I've noticed.
---
.......for trapping?
---
People have modded in multiplayer in New Vegas and Skyrim. It's not like it was impossible.
---
Welcome to the history of Fallout 76.  It‚Äôs trendy to hate it, but secretly loved

Murder, pretty much. You can send them running by intimidating them, I believe, or scare them by telling them they will be *your* dinner, but the 'best' option is to pass the check and go surprise them in the basement.
---
Christmas bundle.
---
I spent two hours wandering around and only managed to find 2 creatures... Then finally one match the circle closed three times and I whole bunch of ghouls appeared near my bush. There was literally 7 ghouls around me. I shot and killed a few with the 10mm SMG and then I ran out of bullets. So I just started melee the ferals with my empty gun and I managed to tag all of them. Then someone chucked a grenade in and killed us all, but thankfully because I tagged them it still counted for me and finished the challenge.
---
These NW challenges are aids, Bethesda needs to do less of these.
---
Man, you must move that photo mode camera fast.
---
Hey man, you sure no one followed you?
---
It‚Äôs a new bug quit the app and restart to fix
---
I'm not sure about the specifics, i just know that I've read this problem and that solution for it many times before in previous posts. Give me a minute and I'll see if I can find one.
---
Let's be real any bloodied user would revolt. They rely on having the extra SPECIAL 24/7. 
---
I'd argue it's what makes them non glass cannons but depending on the moment I can't tell whether it is or isn't from what I've been reading. 
---
One moment it's "I can kill everything. Ez no damage" 
---
The next it's "but it's difficult i can die from a boulder so risk reward"
---

---
I'm in favor of nuking the Vault and harvesting the resulting Ultracite to power the power plants and kill more Scorched.  Or even making a depleted Ultracite bomb to sink the Scorched once and for all.
---
At this point it only cost 35 scrip to roll a weapon. Can only do 3x per day if you plan on selling it back if you don‚Äôt like it. 
---
Not a bad deal really. 
---
Do that 3 times a day this weekend, see if you get lucky. My first role was a 3* fixer. Not the best (suppressor, limb damage, agility) but still felt cool. 2nd role was a bloodied broadsided 3*.
---
Personally they are loosing me after 3600hrs, I am sick and tired of the grinding. It way to repetitive and annoying as hell. Especially on the same dam map doing the same dam things day in and day out. Let's not even get started with this legendary run, it just a big fucking scam. This game has gone from enjoyable to absolute annoyance. I have honestly seen enough at this point. Now the stupid grinding for legendary perk cards, after level 350 the Xp needed to level up is ridiculous to say the least. I was some what optimistic a few weeks ago, now I am seeing through there bullshit antics. 
---
Enough is enough Bethesda! I  have paid more than my share for this game, I have played and supported this game through thick and thin, now it time to stop playing childish games and return the favor, and make it right Bethesda! 
---
I apologize for my rant, but common now, are we going to continue to let them control us,  and force us into doing repetitive game play and continue to put up with paying more for essentially nothing at the end of the day! 
---
Make the game great again Bethesda, stop scamming, and  telling us half fast lies to keep us playing this half finish game you just keep adding more and more ridiculous bullshit to. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best! üòÄ
---
That is a peer-to-peer setup, not client/server. And it's effectively a bunch of separate worldstates sending updates to each other. It's neither client/server like Fallout 76, nor could it scale passably to this game's volume. 
---
Plus, you know, *everything else that's different* that I mentioned.
---
What?
---
&gt; Also, from a programmers point of view, how is this game so easy to manipulate? Seems like every 2 weeks there is some new glitch or exploit.
---
Old engine that's running on a single zombie hamster turning a wheel. They keep building on top of the rotten foundation and keep re-introducing variants of the same issues. Just look at how many old fallout 4 bugs we had on launch with 76. Old fallout 4 bugs that the community fixed with mods years ago, mind you. 
---
There's probably more to it than that though. There have been dead giveaways from the start that there is very poor communication going on between the different departments. They often say one thing in the patch notes and do something else, leave out tons of things, add in jokes like the ammo machine interface, etc. Many atom shop items are different from what we get in some way, meaning they showcase them from a different build and sometimes they don't get the memo. And let's not forget that great meme where they released an update that was built upon the wrong version of the game so it reverted the update before it
---
Lmgs are fun and I‚Äôve used them in my build for a while. If you get one you like then it‚Äôs worth the ammo consumption.
---
Us Americans wear armor, the rest of the world wears armour. 
---
Back to back WW champs get to spell words how they want.
---
Thanks
---
Definitely not a matter of being lazy... I literally walked all over the damn map today and only found 2 creatures in 2 hours. It‚Äôs a legitimate problem.
---
I'd like it 500 but I got it done in two games.  Basically train station to Morgan town University nets you 4-5 each run.
---
Dude i can relate
---
Like I said. I checked that. Turned down and up and everything in between.
---
Go by the power plant by the guard shack usually 3 flies then see how many ghouls you can pick up before you hit town.
---
Rule of thumb is as soon as it's somehow related to the Atomicshop it gets fixed immediately. Players being able to steal stuff through your vendors? Nothing. People being able to dupe or share Atomicshop stuff via the same exploit? Lockdown until attempted fix! People can spawn in the Prydwen or a gun that shoots guns shooting nukes? Everything fine! Player building a Atomicshop item in a teammember's camp? Fix!
---
Not at all, please feel free to check my post history. I'm generally pretty civil if a little sarcastic. It was a mix of having been up a long time, and I sometimes find itscmillertime to be a little condescending to people in his posts (we've both been on this sub a fairly long while), and I snapped at them. And then went to bed. No clue what all the deleted posts were.
---
I will try this and get back to you. Never filled killed the game and started over.
---
totally wrong post. My bad
---
Wait wtf it‚Äôs 1500 levels? I though you got 1 star of legendary for every 50 levels or something, damn I‚Äôm really misinformed lol

I came here just to check if it's been mantioned. Yes, my quest markers are not showing up, pickup or use prompts on objects are not showing up, the loot window is not showing up.
---
Nicely done!
---
This literally reads like "pride and accomplishment" because those who can't play everyday have to pay atoms to complete it lmao.
---
I spent 2 hours playing this shite game mode and only found 2 creatures, f*ck everything about NW Score Challenges.
---
Yes, I was having a lot of fun till i got killed by a flying death claw in my own base. That was a sign to take a break
---
I wasn't even online at the time it reset, nor did I play Nuclear Winter after midnight local time, and this still occurred. Two daily challenges auto-completed for an unexplained reason.
---
Very rare for most animal attacks and black bears are very wary and skittish. There has never been a serious injury or fatality in my stomping grounds but part of the job as a natural resource specialist. Black bear attack footage I had to review was not fatal, but went on for several minutes. The woman was in view of home security cameras catching her trying to tell the bear off (as though it understood English) and she actually walked towards and reached as though to pick up and remove one of the bear‚Äôs two cubs. Common sense ain‚Äôt that common. Looks like the bear and it‚Äôs cubs were checking out the bird feeder that was there, but unsure. Official report stated she was attempting to walk her dog and ‚Äúcame across‚Äù the bear on her driveway and it was was unprovoked. FWS had to hunt and kill the bear due to the attack. She had severe damage to arms and one leg with minor back damage. Also had to review a couple of reports and evidence (no footage) of a couple lethal cases in Canada and one nonlethal 911 recording of a woman who managed to call from the fetal position during a four-part attack.
---
Theres people who just go to events and do nothing literally nothing so after the even is over feel free to kill them for their caps haha
---
No it‚Äôs in the game as a plan from the second terminal most people overlook outside fort defiance. It‚Äôs a slightly more powerful hunting rifle essentially. 
---
 I‚Äôve never seen one drop as legendary personally but it‚Äôs nice it can I suppose, if it‚Äôs indeed intentional. Maybe it dropping like that is a bugged future feature, but it definitely already exists standard.
---
Where did they say this was increased?
---
I can hear the engine of said vehicle blowing up the engine of said game.  Mabye someday todd will invest in a new engine but not this generation hopefully the next.
---
He said scorchbeasts not scorchbeast queen
---
You can get the plan for that or actually you learn it when you go to computer to the right of the front doors of ft defiance.  Outside
---
The rifle blueprint is obtained from the terminal outside the BOS HQ.
---
You probably picked up the blueprint ages ago, and the purveyor gives you legendary weapons according to blueprints you know.
---
A word of caution. Be careful when placing the floors. If you screw up, you will be forced to build a path using the other stairs to that floor, and scrap everything and start over. I've used this stacking method for a good while and its stupid easy to screw it up thanks to how buggy building is.
---
The game does not treat these "stairs" like the others. They do not stack (even though they should), nor are they allowed in terms of making floors "accessible" to a degree. Hopefully we can bring more attention to this and get it fixed. It's been busted since launch.

You don‚Äôt play eso right? Lol it champion point system 
---
Yea they should have just done that instead  
---
After lvl50 you convert to your account champion point lvl (starting at CP1)  
---
then it something like 100,000 exp = 1 champions point  then it goes up the more you have ( correct me if I‚Äôm wrong sorry)
---
In eso there is no cap on champions point you can gain just on the amount you can spend. There are players with over 3000 champions point but the current system spend cap is 800ish 
---
Funny enough the perk coin system is base off eso champion point system so I don‚Äôt understand why they ain‚Äôt include the exp = perk coin Formula like 5k or  10k = 1 PC
---
Indeed, sorry about that, I was tired and I honestly do find some of your posts come across as condescending. For example starting a response with "No" when I was sharing my experiences and not even disagreeing with you that Xbox might have a better climate. You admitted yourself in that one thread about someone wanting none-PC players to weigh in on the PTS beta that you didn't feel comfortable with that, so it made me raise a brow that you were quite willing to do so 'defending' NW on PC and trying to brush away what I had seen with my own eyes when you weren't there to see it pre-Wastelanders.
---
Kill app load it back up should be fixed, it only happens sometimes when starting a new character about a 60% chance
---
Well this is the result and reason why you don't put a small newbie studio on a big franchise like this without better support by the sister studios. Beth Austin is simply too small and inexperienced for the job wether it be coding or communication. It's like taking away the crayons of a small child and telling it to write a master thesis instead, you will get similar results.
---
I would help you out if I played on Xbox. I have tens of thousands of each material needed for crafting arrows because I'm running a bow-only build. Hopefully someone comes along that can get you some.
---
Good ole Bethesda, they could screw up a wet dream
---
Yeah that would be a lot of coding but it is a nice idea tho.
---
Thank you
---
Enclave, Zetans, Vault-Tec, Brotherhood, Elder Gods, who knows?
---
It's down for me too.  I'm on Xbox.
---
In my 325 levels I have never seen a (legendary) Brotherhood recon.
---
Happens often especially now many people are obsessed with xp for kills rather than rapidly and successfully completing events - which is odd as many are on Events teams. I've soloed campfire  but then subsequently failed when idiots blocked my path.
---
It would be nice, I just logged in and took me forever to find a sever because I‚Äôm built next to the white spring train station but, because so many people build their and the radius that the camp placement has I sometime can‚Äôt find a server because, either someone‚Äôs right next to me or like a few feet from me and doesn‚Äôt place my camp.
---
It is definitely this version of the game. Played the free weekend on steam with no issues, can't play this.
---
Make it Ultracite it's makes way more ammo and hits much harder.
---
I dont even know how yo use them
---
And it is not like killing lvl 20 blood bugs is going to give you a ton of xp
---
Yeah I know how that is I normally place mine down the road from the station or past the tower in the field. Normally people don‚Äôt have their camps there.
---
In order to be equivalent to the 250 points for the nuclear winter challenge it would be necessary to level up 2.5 times per day. That takes some time. Does everybody have several hours a day to play?
---
Yeah each new update adds a new grind. FFS lets combine some of them so we‚Äôre not grinding 50 different things everyday. It‚Äôs taking the fun away from the game.
---
video game worship man... shm
---
Probably not. If you already have most cards upgraded,you better keep all packs till legendary perks,then scrap your unwanted cards.Only then you should open your packs,to be sure.
---
That if they don't change this stupid  upgrade system
---
Literally had a whole server play Project Paradise and not a single person filled a tough except me. Then they all watched as our bot fly got decimated by 4 glowing snallygasters.
---
Wow you are just pulling ideas out of your ass at this point. I never even came close to implying that i thought anyone was getting score faster or slower than anyone else. You sir sound like the one who is butthurt because you want to get defensive over a game mode I never said anything bad about, only that I didn‚Äôt want to play that one. The only person displaying an attitude is you. Weirdo.
---
Yeah if you go into NW, get killed then rejoin Adventure it removes the invisible walls. I guess it‚Äôs a bug as someone else said but it‚Äôs been this way for months. I‚Äôve explored all four sides of the map out of bounds and the only thing I found is a few shacks, tinkers workbench, and cap stash in the northeastern corner of the mire out of bounds region.
---
I can just see Cait's outfit's going to be next.

It really isn't, you just gotta keep moving through the grassy areas, farms, and edges of town.

I'm level 233, and it's a first for me, she also dropped me a vampires explosive 50 cal with reduced weight. Good day overall...... For once.

The problem is the model where levels go up n up n up n up.  
---
Should have been a level cap.
---
There *ARE* goggles actually. They just don't show up when you're changing appearance like every other eyewear and hats
---
...y'know, did she ever actually wear goggles in 4? Can't recall these ever being apart of her outfit like Cait's bandoiler
---
That's super weird.
---
What are you going on about? I'm referring to the level up (once) daily, not the repeatable (10k experience) for score. That is the Adventure equivalent for whatever NW daily shows up. It's the only constant and takes the 5th spot in the daily (do 5 tasks) if you are flat uninterested in participating in NW at all. 
---
And leveling up once takes at most 20 minutes if you make a new character and book it to the Overseers camp and the Wayward
---
Well I'm only level 60 so I'm not a hardcore veteran yet, but most 3 star heavy weapons ive seen in user stores seem to at least start at 5k. I typically visit a dozen or more user shops in a day across a couple servers.
---
Legacy items are legacy because of an effect on them, not their weapon model. Everything that can have skins applied to it will still be available in-game and be able to have things applied to it. Bethesda certainly likes to get paid, but this is tinfoil hat territory.
---
This made me actually lol
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/hofo44/ehhhh/) is the closest I've gotten to your photo myself

Yep..the ban wave has started..i know of 8 people so far been banned..its all.over fb
---
I'll respond now I've slept and feel a little more myself. 
---
What you or I want? Who ever mentioned that? This is experience versus experience on different platforms, so a little less appeal to objectivity where it doens't belong would be welcome.
---
Those people could be playing games designed from the ground up as battle royales, and NW (at least on PC, I stress) doesn't have a massive amount of player retention because it's got bloated waiting times, rewards AFKing, and cheaters seem to have to work hard to get banned. (And why are you bringing up Seasons? I've not seen anyone complain about the concept of that, and that fella completed them by constant ceaseless hardcore grinding, which is what a lot of people don't want to do. He admitted himself he is using it to overcome his thoughts in a hard time.)
---
There was nothing "wrong with my connection" (this is where I found you to be a condescending twit this time, if you'll forgive the insult, it just reminded me why I got annoyed) mate. It's a factual historical thing that (**on PC**) you could wait 10-20 minutes trying to get into a lobby pre-Wastelanders because there were rarely enough players to fill one, and even after, you would see the countdown in the lobby reset as people left and joined. It was really annoying. As to why; who says I did? I tried on and off over some weeks, because I wanted to get a higher Overseer level to visit ZAX and see his room, but in the end I did do something else.
---
Lots of New players coming for Xbox and pc, I would hold on for a while and sell your stock to them.

---
Just got done building my umpteenth house lol. It's such a cool little spot. A house spanning a small Creek under a train track bridge just south of the Morgantown railyard. Random spawn point up top, so I always have a visitor.
---
Cait's outfit has been in the files since launch, actually. And you can catch a peek of it in some previews in the shop like the Painted Vending Machine set 
---
So you're probably not wrong in this being the next outfit available. Either this or the Vault-Tec Rep/Mysterious Stranger's outfit (which has also been in the files and in some previews as well)
---
They oughta add MacCready's Duster and Valentine's Trenchcoat!
---
They come for the legendary at the end which may be the only time some of the roof dwellers bother to shoot.
---
Frankly, I'm surprised they ever allowed legacy items to exist. Every online game I've ever played, over a couple of decades (yeah, I'm old), has always made item changes retroactive. They wouldn't just delete your stuff, but if the damage changed or an effect was no longer on it, you can bet every instance in the game would reflect that change, no matter when it was acquired.
---
I've adamantly disagreed with those kinds of ideas since launch, but at this point I just don't care anymore. We had that first wave of hacked items on PC 8 months ago, and people are still running around with nuke miniguns or energy .50 cals. We've supposedly got yet another dupe wave, where people are just duping the same god tiers that have already been cloned on a half dozen other occasions in the past. If they can't remove blatantly cheated items like [this](https://imgur.com/p3mGTB1) or [whatever this is](https://imgur.com/aSgU1KO), then the whole item system in this game is just fucked with no hope of ever recovering. Give everybody access to the console, let people spawn in whatever they want and try to salvage what fun you can still get. That's basically the point we are at now, except there's more work involved because you still have to find a cheater selling the perfect duped roll you're looking for. Just remove the middleman and let us all do it ourselves
---
They just need carry weight dedicated limb mods. Not the strength boosting ones, but something similar to deep pockets. So people can pick that or other buffs.
---
It doesn't? Well damn, turns out I shouldn't have bothered waiting then lol.
---
The only time I saw here wearing goggles was in the concept art.
---
I did the entirety of the event myself whilst a guy stood on a roof doing nothing and then they got mad when I killed the counsellor instead of letting them one shot him.
---
That last part made me laugh really hard haha
---
Gonna use it for a bit, I primarily run heavy weapons, so it's a peach.
---
If you know what to do why don't you get more wood? It's always easy to point finger at others.
---
Get back in the TARDIS, River, this is a fixed point.
---
Thank you for the tips I'll be sure to use this
---
lvl283 and I agree the amount of levels is ridiculous. Please keep you need 200exp+(160xLevel) to level up thus just to hit lvl 500 from 499 means you need 80,200 exp and if you really want to go for the long haul lvl 1499 to 1500 is 240,200 for just one level up. Also you probably have tons of cards that weren't given to you, I've received multiple gold cards for expert lockpick so literally I didn't get a gold card because I already had it gold.

Oh well

def reminds me f some good ol' slasher films, now that they have brought back npc's "The Pint sized Slasher" would make for a great random encounter

As somebody who has played since BETA, this is spot-on. I reinstalled for Wastelander's release, but this .exe is going back in the trash if they can't right their ship soon.

---
Because the modules are still the only thing I care about from the purveyor and for any end game players, I assume it would be the same.... I am hoarding modules in anticipation of legendary plans. It's probably why they don't let you sell SS gear. I know I would just make a ton of that to sell and flood the market ... Free Enterprise :)
---
Hey man is this game pay to win I‚Äôve never played it and considering getting it on Xbox one x when it comes out on game pass is it too late to have fun
---
You're awesome. I was never really a drug user in my past fallout games, how valuable is it to use on this one?
---
Guess they just decided "Hey, why not?" with making the goggles a reality with this bundle then
---
Kinda like how the Umpire Of The Apocalypse outfit is slightly based off some concept art for the Diamond City Guards
---
You‚Äôre words are such that you don‚Äôt want to do the NW challenge and want a chance to redo to change it. When asked what challenges you don‚Äôt like, you finally admit it‚Äôs just that one.
---
Since you can do the whole Legendary Run without having to also do the 1 NW challenge, and you don‚Äôt have issues with the regular challenges. 
---
There‚Äôs literally no reason you need a roll over to get a different regular daily rather than the NW. 
---
Which then brings up the question. If you can complete the Legendary Run without having to do the NW ones. Why do you care about it? Probably because you dont like that they get a chance every day to earn 250 more score than you.
---
Because your reasons why seem pretty obvious. You want that extra 250 daily but you don‚Äôt want to earn it legit.
---
So cramming with walnuts.
---
Seems that there actually will be another ban wave and I‚Äôm curious to see how that will turn out
---
Thanks!
---
Make sure to enter this on the forums if you didn‚Äôt already! Awesome!
---
To be fair I have seen screen shots of people with 15 million fixer plans but my cap limit is 30k
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
It's a role playing game for me! I'm just a homesteader living my life in a beautiful and yet deadly world. 
---
It's very peaceful because I'm not rushing for anything, and I don't need to max out anything.. but also stimulating because of the risks and strategies required to survive out there. There's room for creativity to boot. 
---
So there's no end game for me, not really. Tomorrow is just another day.
---
I'm guessing the blue ridge one would work nicely.
---
well I mean, every Monday you have to come back for Smiley but yes, I agree
---
I always read comments of people saying "The grind is too much I hate playing" and thought they were whining. But with the new SCORE system I've finally gotten there. I'm almost level 400. I always made sure to get all challenges and played every day for usually 2 hours to get the atoms. But now I need to level up every day to get the "Complete 5 challenges" 
---
Not a chance. I now log in and play for maybe 30 min- 1hr. It's painful to get the challenges done daily. I need to keep doing the same things over and over 50 times a day just to level up. I'm shocked you say it's 1500 levels. I don't believe that. It can't be true. If it is, then it's pointless. There is zero point of even wasting time with it. The amount of time to get to level 400 is ridiculous. So it can't be 1500 hours. If it is...What a step in the wrong direction. Who the hell do they think is playing this game?
---
StableFlux...don‚Äôt forget Stable Flux... hello hardened mass, XXXX Raw Flux, high radiation fluids.... it‚Äôs never ending.
---
What we need is fortnite mode, fortnite when you disconnect keeps you there and auto logs you in to that session. Only change we would need to make it work is make it so you can't lose junk upon death. So basically if you lose connection, character stays theres and even if you die you auto respawn nearby with your junk.
---
I guess Bethesda is catering to all the players who exploited their way to level 2000 and beyond.
---
Thanks for the useful link! !
---
but gold DOES show in New vegas
---
I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how she made the tape and uploaded it to penny when nia killed her
---
We‚Äôve had two completely different experiences then because I‚Äôve walked endlessly through open fields and the only places I saw creatures was in Morgantown, minus the very last encounter I had.
---
(I managed to get lucky during my last match and 7 ferals appeared next to my bush after the circle closed 3 times. Tagged em all and some dude chucked a grenade on top of me and killed us all, still gave me the challenge though thankfully.)
---
I would love that! I didn‚Äôt play during all of the survival challenges I would love the mode to be reimplemented with rewards like that and with this new structure!
---
Some very cool ideas!  I'm not usually a pvp player but I'd play this!
---
Is there room for solo play in this?
---
The generic line I get is when the event is incomplete.  Sorry, tried to help you my man
---
*TARDIS sound intensifies*
---
Yeah, this is a thing that happens.
---
A PSA was posted on here about a week or so ago, encouraging players to hurry up and complete their "become death" quest if they hadn't already, before joining too many public teams.  
---
I went and did mine a few days ago, - a bit earlier than I intended to do so. But I succeeded, barely.
---
Anyways, you haven't really missed out on anything. That quest is really just a framing quest for the "Mission Countdown" quests that trigger automatically when entering a silo.  
---
It's still gonna feel really disappointing and deflating though.
---
My PC account is lvl 259. My XB account is 165. Man up buttercup.
---
If someone wants to drop me a bloodied handmade or .50 cal..... not sayin, just sayin..
---
I feel like your trying to make a joke but its absolutely true, lost bloodied explosive gatling plasma and bloodied explosive gatling laser and it didn't even phase after other legendaries disappearing due to crashes in this games first year(lost a ton of TSE weapons when I had a crash back when you could still make floating bases).
---
FYI there is a weapon dupe currently going on.  Just going by word of mouth.  Apparently it's all over facebook.  Maybe coincidence?
---
So if I enter a silo, will I be able to trip the countdown one?
---
that's why I dont' bother with the NW. It requires way to much time to get the daily/weekly. I'm not spending that much time in a mode I don't like. I just accept the fact it will take me a little longer to finish the season, but at least I will enjoy it.
---
\+Karma lol
---
I think bethesda has a much bigger issue to solve atm
---
your character looks like a Pete
---
I like that, very friendly scorch are out there. Need to respect our fellow "former?" People.
---
I love a good fat man.
---
Main issue here it not 'only' the age but the state of disrepair and spaghetticode. Compare it to a car, you could still use and upgrade a 50year old sports car if you kept it maintained and tidy while even a 5 year old car that's left to rust in an abandoned shack will turn out to be unusable in no time. Issue with that is (as many modders have already pointed out in the last year) that they *could* overhaul the entire engine, remove the cludder and spaghetti code but for one the current studio is too small to pull it off ,not to mention keep working on 76 in the meantime, and two the CEOs of Beth aren't really invested in the game after all, they just want to bridge the gap of income until the major studios develope the next 'big' titles.
---
Duuude. You gave me nightmares...
---
I was also going to the slocum joe bundle but alas the atom shop is down :(
---
?? How is NW at all related to the PTS?
---
I didn‚Äôt know we were having a conversation exclusive to NW on PC btw. This is the first time you‚Äôve mentioned that.
---
I still the use the SS, because it's the smallest. I've tried the others, but I like the smaller feel. It's my jetpack that bugs me.
---
Get yourself an instigating or junkies lever or railway rifle.  If you are determined to run full health, your build is fine except you need to remove ammosmith and super duper when not crafting.  Put in at least 1 rank of concentrated fire. Get rid of dromedary altogether. Use sneak and headshots for max effectiveness.

---
Oh it‚Äôs got to be the same engine, just chopped up and sewn back together with new coding till it‚Äôs a Frankenstein reject. I mean I‚Äôve seen a lot of reports of bugs from fo4 all the way to oblivion showing up in 76
---
You don‚Äôt need to buy anything from the purveyor, just go to a train station
---
you're kind of annoying
---
Theyre coming for you next
---
To boost you int you want either herbivore and brain bombs or carnivore and boiled scorchbeast brains. Either will give an extra 6 int as standard or 7.5 with strange in numbers.
---
duping hates you
---
Your average player who messes with duping once in a while might horde them but the real problem is the assholes selling the damn things on ebay and duped item web stores like the one demon asylum links in his duping videos. Back when godrolls were like $60+ it was a joke that people would buy them, but now a lot of the older godroll stuff that's been heavily duped is like $10 on some of those sites. Ive been watching those prices and the lower they go the less and less "almost godroll" stuff I'm able to sell (no matter how cheap it's listed). When people can buy the best for a few dollars and not have to grind caps to buy it that's what happens.
---
You also know duping has saturated the hell out of the market when you see stuff like B2525 fixers and handmades in vending machines for 7500 caps.
---
I'm the same, I'm lousy at PVP...but this mode isn't to uncourage PVP, just to make it available generally to add to the game.
---
I liked the other system. It was fun doing some grinding for atoms. But now you need to level up to get "Complete 5 challenges" (I hate NW) When you are level 400 and need to level up once a day it's too boring to do the same 50 things just to level up. It's funner to complete challenges doing things to get a reward vs mindlessly killing and repeating events over and over just to level up. I gave up on the Run. I do usually 3 maybe 4 challenges a day and that's it. A quick in and out compared to actually playing the game more before. I pay zero attention to rewards and haven't visited the board to redeem anything. Best not to look or worry about it and wait til the end to grab everything. Zero incentive to spend atoms or actual money that way. Oh. And playing a lot less Fallout first seems like it's not all that worth it anymore. I now have enough junk stored to last me 5 years. So thats the end of that.
---
I'd want max rank of all legendary abilitys, that means we get 20 points per stat to play with if I am reading that right. Rank 1 in what rads, and master infiltrator would free up a ton of perk swapping. Follow though sounds nice, but, with how fast most things die from sneak attacks, its probably just way overkill. Taking one for the team thou, if that also applies when a enemy shoots you, I can see everyone running that while being in a public team.
---
I am having the same issue. Didn't even boot the game up yet and its pissing me off
---
Thanks for the tips! that said, please do not expect me to get on the mic in the off chance some invisible man is hanging around somewhere. I'm happy to not kill your horde boss if you speak up and tell me.
---
I used to be the same way, but decided it was best to go with PA. It‚Äôs night and day when it comes to heavy guns
---
So I killed the app restarted the Xbox and nothing. I got pissed, went and got beer and came back and now it's magically working. Also I dying of thirst.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Think this enough to say the game isn't done yet though. Going to check out Phantasy Star Online I think.
---
Nobody PvP‚Äôs anyway lol. But I still totally disagree.
---
One thing you can always count on in this sub: even if Bethesda does something good, someone will complain that it's just not good enough.
---
Excellent work!
---
Soooo. Where do you get the kindling?
---
What hurts the most is duplicate cards that you get, example I've gotten expert picklock at least 3 times gold variant plus I picked it out when it was an option originally so literally I have 3 less cards because this game rolled me a duplicate. So we would have to take into account the chances of duplicate cards occurring for ones we have already and I can see this grind will be bs.
---
Yes, with ranks 2, 3 and 4, letting you auto unlock level 1/2/3 locks and terminals.
---
I've got 500'ish you can have for free. 
---

---
I'll be on for awhile tonight, or back on after 11 (cdt) tomorrow
---
no. pay is cosmetic.  You can't acquire an advantage by spending money.
---
I'm not mad at all. I spend less time worrying about what other players are doing and just having fun instead.
---
My vampires explosive 50 cal with reduced weight would disagree with you. Rng is rng.
---
Don't worry, my main rifle is a Two-Shot Lever-Action Rifle with +50DR while aiming &amp; +10 damage while aiming. I can't one shot higher level mobs like most higher level players. I feel ya. Haha.
---
I'm having that same issue, multiple people are experiencing the same thing
---
Some people just hate s challenge I guess
---
I'm having the same issue as well. Downloaded the game as soon as it went live about 9 hours ago and still can't play. This sucks.
---
Can't blame ya. I do as well. If you decide to part with it. Hit me up.
---
Not everyone is getting that error. Even if they were, it‚Äôs still worth downloading now so you don‚Äôt need to later when they fix it.
---
Same here.
---
I don't ever really use drugs, but pharma farmer also works for stimpacks, radaway, medx and radx, which is very useful. The actual drugs are nice to sell to train stations too.
---
happened to me today... and yup... saw someone else just standing there while I did everything... then timed out and nuttin  :(
---
Go fight some scorched with a diseased scorchbeast about and watch what happens to your xp per kill when you inevitably get the blight and your int drops by 1. It goes down.
---
As always we appreciate you Ladydevann!
---
100% this. Buying them doesn't count
---
I don't care if someone else has a rare (formerly rare) weapon, but I do care when I can't sell anything that's even slightly less than super rare using the in-game trade and vending system because everyone has the best shit already and nobody wants anything even slightly lesser anymore. It completely ruins people's ability to RP as vendors when nobody even comes to their shops because they aren't looking for anything anymore.
---
SAME
---
From what I've heard it was for people who were obviously exploiting the xp glitch for SCORE, not the current item d%pe
---
I use a non legendary combat rifle mostly. Or a garbage I Hunting Rifle
---
1/2 credit
---
That's how updating code works. If you don't fix it or replace it, it stays broken in later versions (unless you manage to fix it by freak chance when doing something else). Some elements remaining from older versions of the codebase are not mutually exclusive w/large chunks of the codebase being updated/redone/replaced.
---
You can probably find lines of code in Unreal 4 that are the same as in 3, or even 2. They don't File -&gt; New Project and start from scratch for every major release. Does that make Unreal 4 an 18 year-old engine?
---
This, if I happen to get 100% or not then that‚Äôs fine with me
---
I figured out that I can only buy gold from him on Sundays. If I miss a Sunday, ooops...have to wait another week. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I thought it had that kind of vibe yea haha no worries
---
Same. Good way to welcome new players to a game that already had a horrible reputation lol
---
I‚Äôd like to see permanent rads because I am the ‚Äúterrible‚Äù bloodied build u speak of basically when u die ur rad level stays the same u can only subtract using radaway and the perk makes rad pills that adds radiation in increments of 10 so u can have the perfect amount of radiation if that makes sense oh yeah it‚Äôs not applicable to nuke zones tho
---
Yes, I agree. I've met some very nice people here.
---
Use 5.56mm weapons, Ammo plant can make 200 5.56mm rounds for free every 30 min or so. The workshop one I mean. It makes 5 rounds every 43s or so. I mostly use a semi-auto handmade gun and i have over 12000 5.56mm rounds in storage and 3000 on me, all from that ammo plant. Though I do also use different weapons, like a plasma gatling and laser gatling once in a while. It also makes 5 for 10mm and 5mm as well, 2 for .45, unsure of rest. Can hold up to 2 lbs of ammo, so 200 5.56mm 400 5mm etc. Crafting is faster of course, but havign the workshop and the raider faction ammo thing also churning out 5.56mm saves a ton on materials. Especially if u get the ammo plant early, I pretty much run ip there by the time my char is lv 8 or so, to start 5.56mm production for the handmade gun.
---
Looking at back then when they revealed they misjudged the Fallout community and were expecting a completely PvP-focused mass of serial killers, chances are they just wanted a piece of the BR cake that PUBG and Fortnite are sharing with some others expecting NW to blow up in popularity like the other two mentioned games. Boy ,were they surprised...
---
Thank you! It's be about 2 hours till I can get back on, should we just do it tommorow?
---
But don‚Äôt want to earn it legit
---
You are insane. I‚Äôm done with you.
---
A lot of people run solo, tbh. You'll run into other players out in the world, especially as you do events though. It's nice to play with friends, for sure, but you arent really at a disadvantage at all by playing solo.

I like the origional backpack
---
So lets get this straight as lvl 283 I get to be punished for swapping perks plus all the duplicate cards I didn't receive since I already had it like example expert lockpick. Your to get the same cards again and again even if you already have it gold and unlocked so I've lost at least 2 gold perk cards because I got 3 gold expert lockpicks which don't save if you have more then one. I really hope they listen to our feedback.
---
Truthfully I would like to see a low trickle of S.C.O.R.E with the Exp you get. Like for every 150 EXP you could get, like, maybe 25 score or maybe every 300 EXP. Just something to keep you playing after you finish your daily and weeklies.
---
I agree, I giggled when I seen that typo.
---
Y'know, if you're on Xbox, I can mod it to the best of my abilities.
---
*cries in plasma caster*
---
it's at the base of a few large trees around the camp, they are marked on the compass during the relevant part of the event. they can be pretty hard to see if you don't know what you're looking for. if you pick up 'wet kindling' it will spawn a mob
---
with sale? I'm a bit off
---
We live in a society
---
There‚Äôs no p2w
---
I spend my days grinding queens/PP/Encrypted and then every so often I design a new camp
---
Im on PS4 but have it modded pretty well. Im level 92 and have straight trash lol.
---
Something like "Murphy's Yaw" where everything and anything that can happen will happen to your character! At random intervals during game-play you receive a random buff, debuff, die, unique random encounter or receive a unique random legendary. Basically just chaos at any given turn! Higher level perk cards give more things that can go right or wrong.
---
I'm lv 62 and have over 7000 steel in scrapbox and i've never once actually tried to farm steel. I just loot everything, and then march my fat ass to a workbench to break it all down. A majority of the poi's have at least 1 workbench in them that can scrap things.
---
Another thing, you those those tin cans you see everywhere? they scrap into 1 steel 1 lead, so those are good to always pick up when you see them and they are EVERYWHERE. Lucky hole mine with the excavator set can yeild hundreds of lead ores depending on luck, my best was getting 5 hits off 1 node for 20 lead ore in excavator PA.
---
It has been for me the last few times. It used to be random, but not lately... at least for me.
---
I've been playing since pre-release and I'm still learning new things. Thanks.
---
Pay for convenience.
---
Wha....huh??
---
anytime's fine by me.  I'll (probably) still be on later, but if not tomorrow works too. (if I'm in a fo1st private, just msg me and I'll switch to a public world)
---
Lol same here! One of my characters has erected a mothman church out there with the forager dressed in ritual clothes. Some of his idle dialogue takes a darker turn out there.
---
*Scream*
---
SF: I should write about her sometime.
---
SF: Poor kid, but it's probably for the best.
---
Not as dark but dad jokey.
---
SF: I planned on retiring to a cabin in the woods, but this is pretty close.
---
Me: Yup sure is, you can see them from here.
---
Yeah I dont know what these people are talking about. Ps4 must have a different recording or something
---
Pretty shitty move.
---
Players requested a battle royale. It‚Äôs as simple as that. You May Say there are better ones out there. That may be true. The point is people do like the mode. 
---
You now seem to be talking PC exclusively (you never mentioned before) so I won‚Äôt speak to that. 
---
Point is in broad strokes people like the mode (maybe not on your platform in your time zone). Anytime you speak in absolutes, you should be prepared for people to disagree. No need for insults because people don‚Äôt agree with you.
---
Agreed
---
not all servers are the same. I agree about the Events, if you are on the right one.  I've been on some that are just constant events. I hit them all and get mad XP.  Fastest i've seen, other than being on one that spams the Queen. Which to be honest, if you are buffed properly for XP you crush 5 level jumps .... but really XP only matters to me to hit daily weekly Season goals.  DO levels past 50 even matter for anything?
---
Personally hope they merge some currencys like the tokens and fuzzy coins.
---
It's because the legendary radscorpion/wendigo spawns behind one of the cabins, and everyone sits on the roof where they're in a position to 1-shot it, rather than being down on the ground standing around the fire where you're SUPPOSED to be.
---
If everyone (or almost everyone) is on the ground around the campfire, I'll play the event properly. But if the server is full of roof-dwellers and I'm the only one on the actual objective (getting increasingly more common, I've noticed), I'll deliberately let the quest fail.
---
Trolling events like this where I'm the only one actually doing the objective has become my new favorite pass time. I'm not going to break my back rescuing an event from certain failure because nobody else can be bothered to play it properly.
---
Okay, thanks man
---
If we buy enough, maybe we‚Äôll finally be awake....
---
Well thanks!!
---
The pills would definitely be handy, I use an assaultron head myself but it‚Äôs not the best for fine tuning haha

---
Had a guy come to my place while I was doing some house work. Tried cutting me, tossed some granades around trying to blow up stuff, hitting stuff with a shovel, trying to get me to respond. I did the mothman dance for him then offered him a gift. 
---
.....a gift from the insult bot. üòÅ He shot me for it then left lol.
---
Noice.
---
I run a high-Strength Bloodied build so I can switch between melee, shotguns, and heavy guns on the fly.
---
There‚Äôre some great PA-only perks for heavy guns, but they‚Äôre not a necessity. If you want a fully-optimized Heavy Gunner build, then PA is the way go. But with the right set-up, you‚Äôll do just fine without it.
---
For me, the loss to carry weight when jumping into PA is just too high a cost for consistently utilizing it.
---
Oh man. Oh well. Anyways, I remember I was like a level 130 or so &amp; I had a Vampire's Hunting Rifle. With that, I had trouble taking down a Scorchbeast. A level 50 one. Ain't gonna lie, I was kind of embarrassed of that. Now, I have that Rifle &amp; I have a Laser Rifle as a back just in case I run out of ammo. Some enemies are surprisingly resilient. That or I'm just weak. Hang in there, you'll find a good weapon sooner or later! :)
---
It just works
---
was it just a XBL banned tho or fallout to?
---
It seems like d00pers never get banned. There's thousands of christmas gifts still going around
---
god, glad u think that way

I just drink dirty water but it would nice where I could just always have nerd rage even after I immediately die

Locked in a Closet is pretty intense as well but for a different reason.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they went from 3 to 9. I wonder if it‚Äôs a bug. 9 seems a bit excessive
---
Current to your lvl only
---
since people did the godmode /xp glitch i lost interest in the score, i saw people who i met as a 300-400 level now being in less than a day 600-2000 with all the legendary run rewards, they cheated and they will get away with it, i canceled my fallout 1st subscription, no reason to support a company that does not care for their game.
---
Piper shmiper. When‚Äôs Kellogg‚Äôs outfit coming?
---
There does seem to be something of a disconnect in some players concept of teamwork when it comes to events.
---
The entire mode needs work starting with how they credit teams that win. If you die early and your team wins you get nothing but the xp you earned at the point of death.
---
Makes no sense.
---
Not much of a grinder.. few hours a day... still got 2 weeklies left n today's dailies.. Haven't done any NW challenges since start... @ 25, almost 26
---
That's nothing new, same thing happens at Scorched Earth when the mobs spawn together.
---
32. A bit of grinding, slowed down the last few days. But I'm on coffee #3 so I guess tonight is a grind night. Doing what I normally do, dailies a few workshops captures etc then server hopping some specific locations to clear. Looking forward to the double xp weekend, should speed me along quite a bit.
---
If you listen to Penny's dialog, she says that someone found a holotape and let's give it a listen to see if we can find the missing camper.

Thankfully my build is decent and I can pretty much stand my ground for anything.

It isn't showing up as a mod option for your backpack?

You can have both.

Anti-Armor also does more damage than Two-Shot now.

Fallout 76 uses the same age old engine as fallout 4 used which is what Skyrim used, etc. The last 10 years of "updates" Gamebreyo ( now the creation engine ) is made to be easily modded from third party developers, the tools are available out there online and with the additional free software people can just download from random sites and manipulate in-game files on the fly is pretty outstanding given Bethesdas stance hacking. Instead of trying to catch shoplifters they put merchandise outside the store on a table with a big sign that says "free take all that you can carry". It doesn't make sense why they didn't just release a new engine with FO76 and "maybe" majority of the hacking, and mass duping would be eliminated, and the few cleaver people who found a way to sneak in wouldn't last long with "quickly detectable" anticheat software but again Bethesda decided to do none of this. My theory is Bethesda as a whole grossly underestimated how quick people exploit open sourced engines, well now they know so hopefully they learned for when starfeild comes out.
---
Is there stuff from Fallout 4 that's not in the files? Not counting things that have been changed from their FO4 version. I always figured they had all of the assets from 4 in there and were just picking and choosing what they wanted to update for 76 and release.
---
My Nocturnal Harpoon Gun nods in agreement with OP
---
Level 29 and only need 600 points for level 30.
---
Maybe the stuff your selling isn't as rare or valuable as you think it is. I for one have made a killing on my vendors, granted, I very rarely sell weapons, but when I do, I just look up what their price is, put it slightly above or below that and it moves pretty quickly. Maybe you need to just adjust your prices. If making money is your issue, there are plenty of things you can sell besides weapons or rare items.
---
if you hit 45 you could use some as there are some weapons that max is 45. 
---
But you may as well wait until 50
---
I have had to start slowing down on gathering junk and scrap. I have the stashbox, but I don't think anyone has any wordly need for the almost 10k wood, steel, bones and aluminum I have XD
---
If you are on PC, I can toss some mats your way.
---
Probably FOMO. If people see something and they know that it could be gone the following week, theyre more likely to splash the cash to buy it now. However I've seen it work against them too, sometimes I'll have the ability to spend money and think "I'm not spending any money until I see something I like". I know a lot of people buy atoms and have them sitting there waiting.
---
If there's a full catalogue they can't use FOMO to their advantage. People, myself included, would just say "I like it but I'm not in any rush, I might get it in a few weeks time. I'll *think* about it." And the thinking part is what FOMO tries to get rid of. 
---
When I ignore the FOMO, I've managed to talk myself out of buying stuff but sometimes I really like something and I have a feeling it'll be gone the following reset, so I buy and it turns out to still be there.

Normally run full Events Team and currently Rank 45. (Bloodied Builds for the Win)
---
You can pick up more kindling during the waves of bugs
---
Yep, finally giving this game a chance now.  and I've done everything to fix this issue all over google.
---
Can someone tell me what it looks like? I've done the event a few times and i literally can never find kindling! I look in the locations marked on the map but nothing stands out. I want to stoke the fire but just dont know how lol
---
pretty much the same.     Some days I hit zen by grinding.  You get in a groove and crush mad XP.
---
Because they are primarily for us end game players. Why would they cater to the people who have spent the most time and money in their game? It just works!
---
More than half the community does it so they don't wanna lose that player base
---
I've very rarely had crashes lately. Running on a pspro, I let my ps4 actually shut off and clean it out occasionally so it doesn't sound like a jet engine going off. Maybe those are the real issues and not the game? Because before I had cleaned it out it would occasionally crash doing anything. Once I cleaned it and stop leaving it in rest mode the time I noticed it ran better. Just a thought to blame the hardware and not the software all the time.
---
I did one roll at the purveyor this morning and finally got my instigating 3* the fixer. Than got on reddit to see it‚Äôs approx worth and..... well, imagine my surprise. 
---
I was than called a liar/duper/ piece of shit essentially.
---
Just provides an imgur link...
---
Doesn‚Äôt actually explain what‚Äôs going on, what perks were active, what legendary effects were on the weapon, what the build was so as to help new players or others.
---
I once decided "Oh, there's a little staircase from this elevation of rooftop to that slightly lower elevation of rooftop. even tho I could just walk off the edge and fall the 4 feet, why don't I act like a human and walk down the stairs."
---
And then I received a huge hit of random damage from a phantom staircase and died. 
---
Alt f4 for the night.
---
I don't understand; is this post not about SCORE or bugs? Where's the profanity laden rant? Are you sure you're in the right sub?
---
Where do you even locate the fireworks? I got them in the legendary run and can‚Äôt locate them anywhere.
---
32 at the moment. Playing to get that adorable Sheepsquatch Plushie üòçüòç
---
Stuff doesnt need to be special. They could have a permanent stock of generic stuff, decent camp sets, couple of good outfits, generic P.A sets. 
---
Then the really good *LIMITED TIME ONLY* stuff could come in. 
---
If they run the atomic shop like an actual store runs instead of running it like some limited time only market stall, it might make everybody a bit more happy and inclined to buy
---
How is it possible to kill players through the 'slap damage'? Or do you expect them to fight you back?
---
Then why not just let it keep going? If they‚Äôre okay with it continuing, they‚Äôre wasting time and effort patching methods out.
---

I might have a spare legendary or two that it just taking up space. What kind of builds do you run?
---
I love the first one, haven't really had an opportunity to use it properly but it looks really good and I feel like I'll be glad I have it when instanced interiors are released though.
---
It is my understanding that the map says you have to do all the daily challenges including the nuclear winter challenge in order to keep up. I am not going to start a new character to begin playing Fallout 76 again, and now I definitely have no interest in playing nuclear winter for enjoyment because it is now permanently negatively associated with anger and frustration .
---
I think they spawn in your inventory.
---
PS4. Stealth Rifleman for now but considering changing since idk what gun to run
---
30 2/3 to 31 but have done all the weeklys except the nw one so far. Grinding a bit daily but it‚Äôs hard finding constant full teams of either building for bonus int or events
---
That would be perfectly acceptable in order to make everyone happy .
---
just MY opinion. I have never duped. I don't know how to dupe. I have no interest in duping. I have never seen duping impact my game.  I've made it to the end game and grind on that daily, for many months now.  I'm just letting you know, duping doesn't have to be a thing that you should care about.
---
Shoot, well if I ever get a copy for PS4 again, I will hit you up and give you a hand.
---
Some one had nuked Whitesprings, and Davenport wanted pics of the Vantage. So I was traveling along next to it, and encountered a group of survivors that were watching the nuclear cloud.
---
it was a tequila night
---
I doubt it‚Äôs more than half but the point is valid nonetheless. And as a non-duper...given how many god roll items can only be obtained from pure rng..kinda looking forward to seeing what pops up in player vendors.
---
Yeah, this is bs
---
Wait a sec. I had like 5 auto completion bugs so far and got all of the SCORE. Also they were mostly weekly challenges. I didn't know you guys were NOT getting SCORE.
---
At 1000 likes ill reveal my perks, at 10 000 likes ill do giveaway for my nocturnal 50 cal
---
The legendary run is awesome. Lots of really cool rewards. So far I've gotten to level 25 in the race and am 100% under the mindset that I will be able to complete it seeing as the enemy only moves one square a day and I move at least 2 to 3 squares a day. 
---
And to top it all off it has actually made grinding fun. No mindlessly boring event grinding inorder to get gold bullion.
---
This may come as a surprise but there's actually very few leftovers from Fallout 4 that aren't direct carryovers from that game onto here. Most of the clothing outright don't exist unless they decide to add it in (like Maxson's Coat and The Mechanist's outfit), so they aren't cherry-picking what to add in from the leftover assets
---
The only outfits from 4 that have been datamined but still aren't in the game are the Clean Suits (except Striped), Cait's outfit and the Vault-Tec Rep/Mysterious Stranger's outfit, and the Diver Suit (Not an Atom Shop outfit). Everything else straight-up does not exist in the files
---
its just 76 being 76 ( a shit game)
---
give it 24 hours and see if Bethesda did anything 
---
at least it doesn't say you were banned on this profile choose another, like it did the 1st time i launched it on pc having never played it before.
---
I was willing to give this game a chance and i lost my best friend
---
I started playing again after a long hiatus.  When I was doing breach and clear I started opening the drawers.   Another player came along and signaled "no" or "stop".  I did.  Why would I need to not get the stuff out if the drawers?
---
Practically forcing people to play NW sucks. I switched from Fortnite to avoid PvP grinding crap. Today killing 9 creatures has taken hours.
---
Ik its annoying i cant put anything in my stash and once i take something out i cant put it back in and the max amount of stimpaks i can carry at a time is 1.25k and its too much of a hassle i just run arround the map and drop like 1k stimpaks to random players the only hope i have of getting it out of my stash is selling it im giving it out for free so if anyone wants any they can come and get some Hell ive even contacted bethesda to remove it from my stash but never got a response
---
So I killed the game restated it and it didn't work. But I went afk for like 30 mins and came back and I had a UI. I was in a box when I went AFK. That might have something to do with it. 
---
IDK about you but this tells me that there are still game breaking bugs 2 years later. Not sure I am willing to put 100 hours in a game that still has these kind of issues. I am glad I got access to it free on xgp, because if I spent money I would be extremely upset.
---
He prolly doesn't know how he did it

We all know dupers have small wieners, so jokes on them.

Lore master here, I spend all my time collecting the stories and figuring out the mysteries of the fallout universe. I spend hours still trying to find a way into ATLAS, I‚Äôll find a way eventually, I just hope it‚Äôs before it opens up with the update. I‚Äôll spend loads of time role playing with othe people in my playerfaction.

Camp near top of the world
---
You misunderstand me. For the quick level up, you do create a new character, but you don't play it beyond leveling up to level 3. You literally walk out of the vault, complete the crafting intro quest at the overseers camp and then talk to Duchess at the Wayward and accept her quest. At most you might have to kill a few scorched but then you level up, and the daily is done. You get the score, back out into the main menu and delete the new character. 
---
And the math everyone "did" at the beginning doesn't take into account that there is at least 1 (double score) weekend and the pass gives you 10 level ups worth of atoms. You'll be fine skipping out on the stressful NW challenges, but there isn't an excuse on skipping the easy ones, like deploying 3 camps or using 3 stimpacks. You can literally just queue up in game, pop them out and leave.
---
God for real. That was the first thing I bought with bullion but never used it because of the weight of the weapon and the ammo. But now that I have a full set of SS armor and dont use power armor, I decided to get the prime capacitor and sniper barrel. I just really want an instigating or junkies roll...
---
Waiting for brotherhood to drop, see what‚Äôs new oh I mean broken and I dunno check to see if it‚Äôs worth hopping back into for a bit but with all the negative reactions to score I‚Äôm kinda just laughing over here at ppl doing the grind lol
---
Think it might‚Äôve been weapons.
---
Yes, I think in trying to force people to playing nuclear winter, they may end up driving away dedicated players by making it a bad experience for everyone.
---
How much were you duping for them to ban you?
---
That's the bitch that keeps breaking in the storeroom every night and stealing his property.
---
All these newcomers make him nervous...
---
The top's not even in sight anymore it's so far over. The last time it was kill creatures it was 3 and that was fine. I enjoy NW and like getting score in it but this is just excessive. Good, wise play often means ignoring the creatures to not give away your location, not hunting them down and exposing yourself.
---
I get you. Honestly, I can't tell you what gun you should get cause A.) Depends on your build &amp; B.) I don't wanna argue with anyone who'll claim that this gun is better with these legendary effects or that this gun is better with these other legendary effects. I mean, I would try out different guns with legendary effects &amp; think if they'll help me at all in a combat situation cause let's be honest, most of the time, you'll find yourself in a firefight &amp; you're gonna need a good gun to keep you alive.
---
That sounds too expensive to me since caps are limited at 30k.
---
Gives me a ball park of what to sell them for.
---
perhaps - I'm kind of a weird position, I never buy anything from the shop except for stash boxes and repair kits, all the other stuff is cool but I like looking like a walking crack hit in the wasteland. my shit is all fucked up, why am I wearing a chef's hat and kurt cobain glasses?
---
Maybe play the game, and earn/trade/buy things to get you something like that. And I didn‚Äôt mean ‚Äòbuy‚Äô on eBay.
---
I think they banning people

---
"Have to".. You don't - HAVE TO- complete it. None of this is a have to. You want to. If you want to, put in the time to. If you can't put in the time to, be thankful they - GIVE YOU- the ability to pay to complete it up to the point you want to. 
---
I honestly don't even plan to get to 100, as I likely won't have the time coming up. Do I think I for some reason deserve the rewards people who do put in the time get?  Fuck no. They dedicate the time to get those rewards. Good on them. 
---
Get over yourself and learn to not be so entitled. You want something? Earn it. Period. If you can't, that isn't their fault. That's yours. They are not responsible for your lack of free time or your completionist complex that makes you feel like you NEED cosmetics in a game.
---
As for weapons, the Institute Rifle doesn't exist, but the Laser Musket, Thirst Zapper, Junk Jet, Mods for the Paddle Ball and the Bowling Ball Launcher mod for the Fat-Man do,. However, they're all in various stages of deletion (Thirst Zapper and Junk Jet only exist as code, Paddle Ball cannot be modded outside of a patched glitch that could let you obtain the mods, Bowling Ball Fat-Man has missing projectiles and the Laser Musket was actually gonna appear in the game, but apparently got axed last minute, since it's mods were already reworked into this game's learn-by-scrapping system)
---
Also due to an oversight with the modded Paddle Ball, if you get a Paddle Ball with the Nuka-Cola mods, you can scrap it and obtain the Nuka-Cola ammo from it, despite the Thirst Zapper not appearing in the game (and what's weird is that you *couldn't* scrap the Paddle Ball in 4, suggesting the mods for it and the Thirst Zapper were gonna appear in the game proper before getting axed)
---
Is this on Game Pass PC? If so, you're not the only one. Many MANY people on this sub are having the same issue. Bethesda has not yet addressed this issue for some unknown reason.
---
omg. so many whiners.. legendary run was impossible withing 10 weeks while it is pretty possible in 6. now legendary perks. do u know that u can exchange animated cards for 5 coins? and every upgrade 5 more coins. 100 levels give u 20 animated cards = 300 coins if upgraded.
---
I just keep getting either the wrong type of weapon or Nocturnal/Assassin/Medics stuff. And I wont argue, I accept constructive criticism and weird out there ideas.
---
oh boy
---
I did it with a random team and communicating with emotes lol. "help" "follow me" \*jump off stairs\* \*get revived\* "love" \*repeat\*
---
I would be glad if I don't ever have to play NW again. Unfortunately things like using three stimpacks requires finding three stimpacks, and since I'm unable to play competitive games that may take three or more entire matches for me to accomplish. I had not considered starting the new character every day as you describe, so that's a clever idea.
---
I get the same error and now the game won't even load....Pc gaming is better they told me!
---
The thing that sucks is somebody will get up to level 3k using glitches, get all the good perks and destroy people in pvp , when nobody in the world can do it without glitches
---
When I asked him about it, he turned away.

Oh believe me. PC gaming isn't without it's faults. But this is certainly a Bethesda issue they seem too embarrassed to acknowledge.
---
It's fine. When you leave and join another world it'll still be there.
---
its not half the community thats just hyperbole. but, its still THOUSANDS of accounts, good luck going too your bosses boss, or reporting to the private venture capital firm that finances your company and telling them, we just eliminated 1000s of accounts from our install base over a bug that doesnt directly effect our bottom line.
---
they banned too many people from the old dupes and had to do an UNbanwave because it hurt their player count. and player count is king, thats the metric they want to see. they dont give a shit about bugs or exploits unless it DIRECTLY effects they money they pull in.
---
I didn't think turning on the game and playing the game and doing dailies, missions, events and trading wasn't considered playing the game. I guess I've been playing wrong.
---
10,000? Those are  rookie numbers son. Anyway with the community building event coming up, I have a feeling you can put all those materials to good use (I'm hoping)
---
Yeah it must be a fuckin blast if you‚Äôre watching TV while you‚Äôre playing.
---
I think you may be into some pretty twisted things.

I play it as if is the actual apocalypse
---
Do you get them off of defeated enemies or do you go to the Purveyor?
---
A similar experience but it was my first nuke. I launched it. It landed so I TP to the location and my game gave me an infinite loading screen. Had to restart. It was solo so I couldn't hop back into the server.
---
Was this comment about an abusive relationship or about playing FO76

Like it haha
---
Or maybe you just haven't heard enough women orgasm üòÇ
---
I mean most people are just playing the game and enjoying the system. This is where people feel thet can be 'heard' so most of what you see is a complaint - regardless of the reality of the system. Then there's people like you complaining when you don't even play the game..
---
This is cute.

I killed it with another guy and got a 1* vanguard wooden arm. Talk about disappointment

I wish I could downvote your post more than once.

What do you play on?

Both. I got nothing but trash rolls today and got like 14 weapons

As someone who plays nw pretty often here is a friendly tip for this daily. If you vote for map morgantown, spawn near the highschool. Right outside of the netrance of highschool there usually spawns atleast 1 sometimes 2 and up to 3 dogs. Easy way to complete. Hope this helped.

They seem to think click simulator tactics are amazing lately. Click click click, time sink into the unpleasant world of clicking into oblivion. First the ammo converter machine, now this change. As if things weren't bad already with the legendary perk grind, now it's even worse.

I dont want to defend Bethesda because they fucked up a lot the past 2 years but most of your points aren't fair. Saying they only work on the atomic shop? Comparing communication to that of games who have been in the online scene for over a decade?
---
I have my gripes about F76 but the devs are normally pretty communicative and after the launch of Wastelanders they were very active for a little while and now they've got their heads back down and working on new content. 
---
Fallout 76 is in the process of changing into a very different model from the one we previously had. Big drops and leaving it there. We are switching into a seasonal model which is yet to be fully tried but that is the goal of this season and let's just get one thing straight, it's the art team that works on the Atomic Shop, sometimes gameplay (if a new gameplay affecting item is introduced). 
---
A single look at the Atomic Shop over the past month and a half screams laziness. Almost no thought, stuff returning after being gone less than a week despite them being around for over a month before leaving for said week and most of the stuff being old items. 
---
I think a little more organisation would go A LONG way but they're getting there. They are consistently taking out feedback from the PTS and adjusting/changing things completely. 
---
I wish they'd work more on bugs however let's not forget this isnt the MAIN Bethesda team, these aren't the guys who made the engine and they can only do so much to patch up core issues that are embedded into the core of the engine.  
---
You'll have a better time not comparing each different dev companies approach to communication. Bungie has been in the multiplayer scene for well over a decade and a half. They know how to communicate with online communities. Ubisoft has been dabbling and within the last decade dived right in. They made A LOT of shitty mistakes when they first started out including complete false marketing of Rainbow Six Siege. 
---
Bethesda is very much a company who have always made Singleplayer driven games that didn't need much communication. They're in the early stages (yes its been almost 2 years I know). They have a long way to get back to where there were with people. They broke a lot of trust with how F76 launched but the dev team working on this game is trying. 
---
On the point of hacked weapons and hacks overall, I can't and won't try to defend that. The state of NW due to hacks and some of the absurd hacks that go on in Adventure is not forgivable and with the held of Zenimax they should be developing a strong anti-cheat. Most of the hackers only cheat because it's extremely easy and they want to fuck with people because of it. A lot of them have been very vocal and upfront about it too, citing that they are angry at Bethesda and due to how easy it is to hack, they are fine doing so and will continue until Bethesda either;
---
1) Shut down F76 (won't happen)
---
2) They get bored
---
3) They develop a strong and efficient anti-cheat that isnt easy to get though, making it more hassle than it's worth. 
---
Sadly I don't see any of those things happening and I believe hacking will be a consistent problem this game has to deal with until custom server modding becomes a thing and people can change the game to how they want it to be.
---
I got my Rifle of the Purveyor. My best advice, like I said before, is to hang in there. I didn't get the Rifle I have until I was like level 190 or so.
---
I spend my time by purging abominations with holy lead

This just shows how little Bethesda cares about the game

Sad part is if there was a way too keep it in there hands only. It would have stayed that way. All I see is a bloodied nerf

I love just roaming the woods looking for stuff and places to hangout.
---
I usually pour most of my steel into railway spikes since I have a railway rifle I absolutely love. I believe it's a bloodied one. I have to recheck.
---
Every so often Bethesda allows the purveyor to trade their RNG stuff for a discounted price. That‚Äôs going on this week. 
---
For example, instead of 100 scrip for a 3-star ranged legendary it‚Äôs now only 75 scrip. 
---
The sale doesn‚Äôt apply to legendary modules.

I gave up being a stealth commando so im probably not the best guy :(
---
I buy stuff now and again but I find myself only wearing the earnable NW stuff. I like showing off that I endured ridiculous amounts of pain and suffering to get those items lol. 
---
I used to buy repair kits but have stopped since I got back into the game when Wastelanders dropped. I dont wanna waste money on that and I grind enough Scorched Earth to have plenty of Improved Repair Kits anyway.
---
4 months ago and STILL an issue. Me and my wife both just spent $17.50 on Fallout. False advertising since we can't use the feature. Are we going to get our money back?
---
I thought it was terribly hammy, personally, like a proper campfire tale.
---
.
---
Compare it to, say, the holotape of the Responder locked in the closet of the airport? Now THAT is terrifying. #2 is the guy in the fridge of Flatwods. WHat a horrible way to go. :(
---
This is exactly the reason why items are only available in limited runs. Fear Of Missing Out. Better get it now, because it's only available for a short time, or you don't know when an item might be vaulted. It's a common sales trick, creating artificial shortages, seasonal items or periodically rotating stock to encourage people to buy now.
---
Now that's exactly the type of Survival Mode i want! Actual tension/Roleplay opportunities. Like you said: You would have zero idea who's an NPC Raider/who isn't one. That would be brilliant right there.
---
Great ideas all around OP!
---
I grow a ton of tomatoes for adhesive.  If someone took some of it, no big deal. If they harvested all 40 tomato plants I might get upset especially if I need adhesive right away. As long as you aren't just looting someone's crops completely, it's should be a non-issue.
---
Well we want you to stick with the game, and we always have tons of weight we wish to unload. So keep being you and keep playing!
---
Same!!!
---
I just punched an assaultron with my bare fists. Killed her and found out she doesn‚Äôt count as a creature. Ugh lol
---
I like the idea of it, but I feel like it was poorly implemented. They're obviously trying very hard to get you get you to buy atoms to complete it. I think it should be more lenient for people who can't get on every day. Sometimes between work and life I can't get on every single day to make sure I'm able to complete every challenge or make it grindable through events.
---
If someone doesn‚Äôt steal it
---
Because they don't want people farming out a specific legendary weapon or armor. That would be far too kind. 
---
They want people constantly playing the shitty RNG game and gamble their scrip for useless legendarys with an extremely low chance of getting anything they'll even take a second look at
---
"Armoral Behaviour": You're so certain that regular armor is better than Power Armor that you're not even convinced you need to wear regular armor. Chance on hit to unequip any armor you're wearing but gain DR/ER equal to the combined weight of all armor in your stash.
---
They are more likely to provoke impulse purchases by creating a false urgency. Also, pre-season 1 people might grind for some things, but limited time offerings you're forced to spend cash on atoms.
---
Your solution is better for players. Current situation is better for Bethesda. Don't hold your breath on things changing anytime soon.
---
I will bush wookie until we get a team deathmatch or something. I want the rewards but I can't be bothered with battle royale and it's easier to just be in the top 3 or 5 by doing nothing basically.
---
Jesus, you should get some kind of reward for that. How the hell did you not get melted instantly.
---
People dupin' like crazy out here
---
Eventually they will start a converting system and take some out of rotation.. while fallout 76 isn‚Äôt an mmorpg it seem they taking it that direction
---
Shit. I thought it was going to ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm pretty much only focused on SS Armor myself. At 3/5 on unyielding, only one wwr though.  I ran into a nuke zone today and hit 18 rads/sec with 3 pieces. Looking forward to that not being a death sentence anymore.

&gt;Honestly, you do you if it's in a better place on Xbox

From my post last night. After you noted things are better on Xbox. And nothing at all what it does have to do with is you have no experience with how NW is/was on PC, but feeling well informed enough on it's history on PC to tell me 'No' and try to dismiss my experience on the plaform I actively play on lol.
---
Theres a place you can go to that has a ammo maker
---
It‚Äôs an Atom Bundle, similar to the con/event bundles where you could get the Battlecoat or the Pint-sized Slasher outfit and knife. 
---
$8 USD for 1100 Atoms, x5 Scrap Kits, x5 Repair Kits, and the outfit and cap.
---
I literally JUST did this event tonight for the first time and it didn't seem like any other voice acting from a Fallout game. Truly chilling. Definitely caught me off guard. Unfortunately, of course, some 4th grader was on my public team and was annoying af throughout the whole thing. Hoping it pops up again so I can solo it.
---
Preaching to the choir my boi. 
---
As somebody who is currently level 105 in Nuclear Winter, I think most things should give more XP since it takes me ridiculous amounts of games to level up now. I used to be guarenteed 100XP a day from duplicate card packs from dailys, now dailys don't award any NW XP, just score.
---
Same dude
---
Yeah it's like once this challenge hit all creatures just decide not to spawn
---
I did it in 2 games, I run into like 8 creatures a game sometimes. 
---
I think they should a whole set of NW dailys and weeklys that run alongside adventure.
---
‚ÄúMutant Furry‚Äù perk - Cosplay as a glowing mutant hound, and for every fetch quest you complete, you get a can of dog food.
---
Is this a JoJo meme?
---
I have no idea. I stayed crouched and she seemed not to even notice me. Stayed behind her.
---
Also wanting to know this. Are they out?
---
This has not happened to be before but try server hopping or going to desktop to fix the issue
---
The legendary perks are currently on the Bethesda fallout 76 PTS. They will not be coming to the game until update 22.
---
It is expected to drop with Patch 21.
---
They‚Äôre not out. Getting a rework.
---
They aren't out and you won't get them for free. You'll get points from scrapping regular perk cards and you spend the points to rank them up
---
Yeah smartass why dont you if you google it the first thing it says is no int doesnt affect xp. Or can you not use search basement dweller the library have google blocked does it!
---
Big shrug. I didn't 'insult you' because you disagree with me, I insulted you because you tried to condescendingly dismiss what I was saying "No lol, lol faulty connection bro, lol go do something else" and such. It's an irritating form of debate to dismiss people's comments. Note that I never once said you were wrong or tried to indicate such on the matter of the modes health on Xbox.
---
I do contest that it was a highly requested feature, still. I remember a hell of a lot of confusion about it's inclusion, particularly linked to the issues that adventure mode still had at the time.
---
You have a good point.  We're getting new toys...but for what?  Hopefully the Wendigo Colossus thing works out.
---
If they are on your team and join your instance when you go through that questline.
---
They can join you but it won‚Äôt progress their story only yours
---
Do they get gold to?
---
As someone who plays nw i agree with your point. Most of the times i build a compound and wait untill the cirkle gets smaller just for the xp. Altough i do pvp alot within my compound i never get incentiviced to get ALOT of kills.
---
People that afk should be banned, that is a more important task imo.
---
(The afk accounts arent players, people boost account just to sell)
---
got it now, why not the modules, is just bad decisions all over the place.
---
LOL, I guess so. üòÇ
---
You should get the 1st six basic cards for free,one every 50 levels. So at lvl 300 you'll have 6 lvl1 legendary perks.
---
This as far as i understood
---
Pretty much like real life, actually.
---
My focus is acquiring plans. I can build a ton of weapons I have no intention of ever using. I can build pretty much any piece of power armor (still looking for the t45 left arm), but never, ever wear it. I know every power armor paint job that doesn't require an atom shop purchase except the new season pass paints past level 28. Ever since Minecraft, I've defined "winning" a game as being able to make anything in the game whenever I want to, whether or not I ever plan on using it.
---
I decided to play for the first time in since a little bit after Wastelanders. Within 10 minutes the game froze and I just shut the game off and probably won‚Äôt touch it for a while. Not really looking to spend my little bit of free time trying to get a game to work.
---
Trying again, it's ok though I can wait until tomorrow, no rush.
---
I love hearing these stories. I‚Äôve had several players drop off free stuff. I‚Äôm trying to pay it forward as well. The community kindness is positively overwhelming.
---
I fucking shat myself dude first time going there as it was undiscovered - blood curdling scream, pictures spinning, fucking ground shaking I got to fuck!! 
---
Its lucky I can't nuke it
---
Lmao this sounds great
---
The honest truth is currencies will stop being added only when the game is no longer updated. It's common practice in games that continually evolve over time. As new content is added, new desirable items made available but wanted to be gated behind time so people don't just buy everything with their stockpiled wealth immediately. The two common methods to slow down rewards and extend play time is the reputation grind and locking the new shinies behind a new type of currency. So as long as they keep adding new things, expect new currencies to be added.
---
It's a single daily. The maximum amount of time it could take is 30 minutes (due to there being a 30 minute challenge).
---
As a player of all modes, I find it extremely frustrating that most people complain about having to do a single NW daily when NW players are literally forced into adventure for the majority of their time if they wish to complete the pass. 
---
My suggestion is make every challenge have a NW AND Adventure varient 
---
‚Ä¢ Level up once in NW or Level up once in Adventure
---
‚Ä¢ Kill 10 ghouls in Adventure or Kill 5 creatures in NW
---
Sort of like that. As much as I've heard the argument of "the season pass is for Adventure" the rewards can be used in NW and some (the ghillie armor) seem built for NW specifically, even if it doesn't work there yet. I believe they should work to please both playerbases. Let NW players just play NW and let Adventure players just play Adventure
---
If they have already completed the quest line then I'm pretty sure the answer to that is no. I am unsure though.
---
At a point it felt like it was going on too long and felt.. weird to me
---
Nice! Glad this happened. Players can be so kind!
---
Random bits of armour with the unyielding legendary on them
---
After this most recent dupe I‚Äôm done playing. All I do is grind for legendaries, what‚Äôs the point now? I‚Äôll pick back up on fallout 5.
---
No they don‚Äôt just you

Cassandra is child of a lauded Pre-War engineer and a decorated army officer.  She was born in Vault 76 and raised to high standards and ethics of her parents.  She was very intelligent, ambitious, and eager to lend a hand.  She has an innate understanding of mechanics, electronics, construction, and engineering.  Her parents passed in a tragic accident before Reclamation Day.  When the Vault door opened, she went out to do the duty set to her and her family.  She found devastation and failure and nothingness, but she also found the Brotherhood of Steel.  There she found structure and purpose.  She donned the uniform of a field scribe, climbed into power armor and set out to complete the mission of so many.  She‚Äôll aid Settler and Raider...but lone raiders better watch out...Appalachia is dangerous.
---
Molly was an Army combat medic.  Serving notably in Anchorage, she was wounded multiple times in an incident where she repeatedly placed herself in harm‚Äôs way to evacuate her fellow soldiers.  She was sent home to recuperate, to be awarded, and to be paraded for the war effort.  Scarred and partially blinded, Molly took positions in training and research into combat medicine.  She knew she‚Äôs never see combat and was fine with it.  She‚Äôd seen enough and been disillusioned in her country‚Äôs cause.  The medic was offered a position in Vault 76 due to her stagger amount of decorations and her innovations in resourceful battlefield medicine.  The aging medic hoped she‚Äôd be never see the surface again, but she was used to disappointment.  Molly emerged to the surface and stubbornly plodded her way around Appalachia, trying beat some sense, reason, and future into the wastes.  The medic helps anyone she finds with surly, reluctant purpose.  She leans towards the raiders, only because they seem to like her gruff nature.  She eyes...well, eye...she lost one in Anchorage, Meg.  She sees a weak leader who barely holds on and sees a chance to take a hold of the raiders and keep them from walking the path self-destruction she saw in the corpse of the Savage Divide.  They don‚Äôt have to be nice...but raiders eventually run out of things to raid and starve.  Properly focused authority was an age old power structure...
---
Same. Got the clean sink,got the ammo converter and working towards a space wallpaper. I'm content.
---
They trigger on people who dupe large quantities, or gain many of a certain item in a short time, especially treasury notes/legendary modules.  The focus on combating duping seems to be more toward identifying and banning the real money traders though.  
---
The guy with a duped explosive handmade is probably not gonna get hammered because most of us have probably at one point owned something that was duped, whether we knew it or not.  There are so many out there that it would be next to impossible to prove something wasn't bought legitimately or traded for. 
---
The core issue is that they have to safeguard all of us against losing items when the servers crash, or we get disconnected suddenly, etc.  The servers are overloaded and laggy, and this increases the chance that this will occur.   Therefore, there has to be safeguards to keep the community from coming unhinged when we lose our BE OMG Legacy weapon because the game just locked up and we got ejected.  This is the basis for most duping methods.  Knobs find ways to exploit these safeguards.  There are obviously other methods that are just bugs, but those usually aren't the biggest problem.  Bethesda usually patches these methods quickly.
---
Holiday Gifts are a sticky subject because millions were duped and many unsuspecting people have obtained them simply by finding them in the world abandoned or through gifting.  Maybe that is why Bethesda has seemingly turned a blind eye to those who don't have 10,000 of them or whatever.  They did however do a stealthy change to the weight of them so that dupers can't hold nearly as many as they used to.  They simply weigh too much in large quantities.
---
Banning everyone that has something that is determined to be duped would be counterproductive and hurt the player base.  But banning the ones that have obviously been exploiting the system and possess piles of them should and eventually usually do get the hammer.
---
I am loading into a server right now. i left one as there were some people doing dodgy things
---
Probably just a decision by Bethesda to artificially slow-down module acquisition; i.e., keeps the casual player from getting too many chances at a god-roll gear in a short period of time. 
---
It‚Äôs dumb. People that can get a lot of scrip don‚Äôt care - they can get modules a lot. It‚Äôs more casual players that get screwed.
---
My brother and I did it over 3 matches. Spawned into the Morgantown High School parking lot. There are usually a few mongrels out front and a few in back. One match didn‚Äôt spawn any but the third match did.
---
He would punch them and I would kill them. Both got credit.
---
You will get the ability to collect treasury note which can be exchanged for gold bullion
---
I believe this is Bethesda's pathetic way of getting people to play their game for years. Some people will go along with it because they think Bethesda does no wrong. But most people will just get burnt out and move on to the next big game.
---
Yeah I plan to but obviously Im not at my system or I would just try myself.(work)
---
Hope it‚Äôs better than the Colossus thing now lol
---
Body shaming isn‚Äôt very cash money of you
---
I‚Äôm using a VPN so I can be anywhere technically.
---
Also a tip is don‚Äôt give the faction you sided with some of the gold at the end you will lose rep but it‚Äôs good for the long run
---
I did it!
---
Alright thanks
---
Just so long as I get called a good boy after each fetch quest with it slotted.
---
Yes! At least a 10% discount.
---
You just need to have a friend from Europe and join their server
---
Been playing stupid NW for 4 hours now. Still at 7 damn creatures. This challenge sucks.
---
I "interned" at Bethesda for a while /s
---
This is neat! You did a great job recreation Piper! Hopefully we get even more outfits from other games. Maybe even crossover from other franchises would be cool.
---
That's the same error I'm getting. I've been trying to verify if anyone who has it through gamepass it able to play, but so far nothing. I created a support ticket through bethesda, and in the title stated that I was using game pass on PC, and they asked me for the diagnostic report from the Bethesda launcher. They're not aware that the Xbox PC app version doesn't use the Bethesda launcher. That alone tells me that Bethesda was completely unprepared for the game pass launch, or the move onto the Xbox PC store. Which isn't a surprise at all, but still frustrating.
---
For me it's finding a team with a fellow mutant to take advantage of my stranger in numbers mutations.
---
What are you guys playing on my fallout hasn‚Äôt crashed in over a year
---
Who died and made you captain of the Reddit? Unless you are deaf and blind, the situation in game right now IS pretty atrocious and warrants as many complaining naggy ass threads we can stuff in the official forum and here hoping that it gets so bad someone takes their head out of their ass over at HQ and tells us what the fuck the game plan is.
---
I think for the fatman yes. I script‚Äôd mine. I don‚Äôt carry nukes
---
When playing yesterday, I found a lot of super mutants by bolton green and animals in the area, also near the power plant. was bloat flies
---
If we go by the original lore we find in fallout 3, the enclave wiped out the entirety of vault 76 25 years before it was due to open as part of a systematic purge and in partnership with the experiments carried out by vault tec
---
The enclave and the brotherhood used to belong to the same faction in the early days, however 76 glosses over this entirely, if anyone expects decent or lore friendly writing from the 'Current Bethesda' then they genuinely need to have their existence examined.
---
Could you join a European server then I join you
---
I finished it in 2 matches in Morgantown both times.
---
 West side of the map had a couple and there were a bunch in the train yard after the fire started closing in.
---
Lol I‚Äôm on this sub and 99% of the posts r about the game being broken a grind or things people want Bethesda to fix. I got 2 characters lvl 100, I‚Äôve played the game and I‚Äôm bored of the grind, sorry to complain I guess my voice shouldn‚Äôt be heard
---
I'm not looking forward to this as an xbox player if that's the case. I have been playing alot for 1 month and am only level 145. I cant play to level 1500
---
Nice.
---
I‚Äôll be on in a few and I‚Äôll message you on here to let you know.
---
I'm sure it's an issue with how the armor is really compatible pieces that you put into a chassis 'container'....  anyone know?
---
The harvested souls of dupers
---
Everything is screwed
---
Careful, my guy.  I have seen bans begin.  They might be able to log transactions to/from the vendors.
---
Hmmm it‚Äôs been a while since I did that quest, from memory the quest completes when you scan the built Excav PA yeah? The scanning is tied into the quest and has nothing to do with the armour outside of there, but I don‚Äôt think I had the station frame either then,
---
Best bet is to try rebuild it at another frame station and pray for the best. If you need help with resources I have a disgusting amount üòÇ
---
.44 in particular is really bad about it, but all of the ammos are basically used by at most like two different weapons. 
---
Like why doesn‚Äôt the lever action use .44? .45 doesn‚Äôt make sense and already has a rifle.
---
Sounds like survival of the fittest to me. They learned the hard way from those ghouls.
---
Also sorry to hear they sent a negative message. Ppl need to realize this is a game at the end of the day. No need to get nasty with ppl.
---
Awesome just let me know
---
Campfire tales is a top 10 quest for me, I enjoy it even more with public teams encouraging people to do events.
---
Will do.
---
I think bethesda has already started to, but I‚Äôve taken it upon myself to actively seek out these dupers by making posts on Xbox to attract them.
---
It's great to get some free content just for playing the game. People just need to relax. Bethesda could have charged for access to the pass.   
---
Restart the game as an xp build if the grind is too much.
---
Thx ill have to give this a shot tonight and see whats what as I previously stopped using all mu uny sets as I didnt feel a need for them rarely running a true bloodied build anymore.
---
Same as the small candles, they also have a white glow
---
I highly reccomend the bear arms perk at least at 2
---
You clearly also forget all the positive press it got when it was released. Or how excited people were when it was announced at that convention.
---
Right? Especially since from a cursory Google search, a real life rifle like that would use .44!
---
Either let us upconvert pistols like the Western Revolver into rifles, or (and this is far simpler) make some .44 receivers for the Lever Action rifle
---
I appreciate you
---
I'm currently sitting with a vendor screen open where two people were obviously duping, at least I can disrupt them for all of 3 seconds
---
fast traveling to someone‚Äôs camp and then they leave
---
Wish we can just input the number..
---
Shits bogus
---
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
---
Yeah at first with the dupings I got excited, but then I realized how screwed the game was because of it.
---
Did you try and log out and back in?
---
I'm 165 and never knew that workshop actually produces prewar food!?
---
Getting a critical headshot for 1900 damage and a kill just to leave VATS and the enemy be full health 
---
800 times a day
---
Exactly, I've got 1,615 hours into 76, that's all literally worthless now because people can dupe and have unlimited everything
---
While I‚Äôm not captain of the Reddit, I do enjoy the game. I know things are broken, but I don‚Äôt complain about it all the time. There are people that still enjoy the game because they work with the difficulties and don‚Äôt freak out when things go wrong. In the end it‚Äôs just a game. You can think whatever you want to think, but so can I.
---
And what I mean is...  I don't know if they can track duped items after being dropped in a bag, but...  one day that gun may disappear without warning and/or you'll get booted.  Be wary of big ticket items that get dropped.
---
I love the Flatwoods map but never get to play it anymore. Seems like every time I play it‚Äôs Morgantown. 
---
Would be cool to see the Ash Heap.
---
Mutants is why I'll jump teams. I need other mutants.  When I dont' have other Muties, I feel that missing 25% boost
---
I'd join, but I'm already in a brotherhood RP group
---
Uh... link?
---
Wait theres a sale?
---
I have 1670 hours in and I‚Äôve crashed once during beta not joking I‚Äôm dummy lucky like that
---
Xbox one
---
My very first try was a 3 star unyielding chest. Then two later 2 star unyielding right leg. Then a few trys later, 3 star unyielding left leg. I'm not even a bloodied build! 
---
Have a full set of SS armor I'm happy with. Now trying for the minigun. Bet that's where my luck runs out.
---
Let me know and I'll try to get map pics of where I've been looking
---
And it says i have 17 mins left for my grounded serum.
---
Thank god ban all the cheaters and not this essay bs
---
"That's a motorcycle, Todd."
---
It's probably on the drop list from "A Colossal Problem" which isn't live yet.  
---
Given it was originally supposed to go up with the most recent patch but got pushed back for more testing, the assets were probably left in the patch.
---
For a stealth sniper, I really don‚Äôt have much in the way of strength.
---
Oh! "Rad"! Lol
---
Ah that makes sense
---
They drop from the upcoming Colossal Problem Event, not the standard Wendigo Colossus enemy.
---
Scroll down on your pipboy.
---
Lol me too as they ruined my whole stash of presents and event plans.(Not even counting the scrip which I think at the time pissedme off just as much.)
---
It's almost as if...the Devs don't play the game.  Just like....every update, the entire time!  I love this game and accept it's flaws (looking at you Ammo Converter pile of shit).  There's just a massive disconnect between the people that invest an unhealthy amount of time in enjoying the product and the people pushing this shit out.
---
Yeah, def give it a try since it‚Äôs on game pass. I think the game is fun as long as you understand the systems are not perfect. BGS has been getting better with listen to player feedback and making things better, but it isn‚Äôt perfect.
---
Perhaps I did, it's a long time ago now. It still struggles to retain players on the PC, however. Challenges tied to SCORE have helped - but only in the sense that there are seas of Rank 0's loading into any given lobby with the goal of finishing the challenge and then committing suicide.
---
Time really will tell. I'm sure the discussion will pop up again in six months, when the initial rush of Wastelanders and Game Pass members has run it's course.
---
Lots of people (including me) are having the same run-in.  Plays fine through Steam, but nothing on GP.
---
A true drug addict would get the C up, take a break to shoot up and forget about the rest on the ground.
---
They can tell how many scorchedbeast we killed so I think they have access to more thanmost think.
---
Other people have you‚Äôre weapons games ruined o no
---
Yeah and even the bans won‚Äôt undo the damage done
---
Yeah I just know random encounters online can be iffy. I'm sure I'll find a niche group that I can actually stand playing with but I'm definitely moreover a solo player in general. Thanks for the response
---
I did :(
---
Icebreaker prototype A.
---
Haha salty much? Crime never pays...for long.
---
A lot of Backpacks, especially the Square-shaped ones, are glitched and not placed correctly on the character.
---
Also I think the color is supposed to match the other Ghillie Armor skins from the Season and not the Ghillie suit from Nuclear Winter.
---
It should still be listed in your pipboy if you are running starched genes 2.
---
Still relatively new to all this so bare with me.   If duping is so prevalent why am I not seeing tons of great weapons in vending machines?  It's basically crap out there for the most part.  Is it only a thing on PCs?  (I'm on xbox).   Asking because other than weapons and armour I don't see the need to dupe anything else.  I spend most of my time dumping items because I always have too much of everything.  Hell, I'm even dumping legendary items now just to make room to continue playing.  Thanks in advance.
---
Nah it‚Äôs not that, it‚Äôs more of the market being ruined. I could care less if everyone had great weapons, but that marketplace kind of lost its appeal with all these duped weapons.
---
"It just works!"
---
They would cost 37.5.
---
You could then make a 3 star shotgun with it.
---
That sells for 40.
---
Not even molemen are that dumb.
---
&gt;i.e. catching a disease, starving, dehydrated 
---
Yadda, yadda, yadda. Yup, but now I'll only be thinking of Seinfeld when it happens.
---
Hey man, the purv spends a lot of time crafting those modules for you. She just finds all those nocturnal rolling pins laying around of course she can discount those. Have some respect!
---
Yes but be aware going in that the scrapbox will very much change how you manage your stash space. If you ever plan on getting rid of it in the future be aware that you'll struggle to adjust at first.
---
I‚Äôm at 33
---
Everyone is welcome! You can think of this as an alternate dimension aha it‚Äôs just a game after all! You pick how you‚Äôd like to have fun with it üëç
---
I guess it was just a glitch... i was scared. The mutated fallout boy walked on my screen again so i guess it came back. I had just spent 800 caps on a serum as well i was PISSED.
---
This is a brilliant guide! I'm thinking of becoming a junkie now but I was wondering if playing low health to benefit from unyielding is still viable? That way I don't care for loses on stats unless it's a bad idea? ty!
---
The fuck are you talking about? We've already "worked towards" those insanely high levels. It took me 1200 hours to get where I am now (Level 600). Excuse me if I want to be finally rewarded for it with actual rewards instead of being allowed to grind for another 900 levels (It doesn't get any faster, you know that? I already need to pop 10k XP challenge 9 fucking times to level up once, it's absurd).
---
The game developers should, they are creating this lore after all.
---
I‚Äôve never had this happen to me and I‚Äôm glad
---
Yeah it does indeed suck. Im just hoping they treat us well and drop quality atx items in the seasons(Assuming we have more.) Honestly its already better than their "premium membership" with its 5 re-color ranger outfits and tents.
---
800. Overpriced. 500 is market. Well on PC at least.
---
The scout uniform could only be gotten if you played the game in the first year of it being live. Maxson‚Äôs coat was from an old atom bundle.
---
Mountain is beta/launch players only and coat was bundle from Microsoft store
---
Thats a great suggestion.  The only issue is the way the awards are separated. So while you're trying to please the nw crowd by letting them participate in the pass the awards are still mostly in adventure.  So that's still a little niche. I think its great but I dont see many people making use of it.
---
I don‚Äôt believe it is. The windows version has ‚Äúcrossplay‚Äù with steam and Bnet client. But not with Xbox game. Xbox play anywhere is only for Xbox 1st party titles.
---
I don't mind nuclear winter, but I despise today's daily because it is 100 percent RNG dependent.  Creatures spawning is purely random. In some matches it's common, and in others you barely see any.
---
One would argue that patching it out is *a stance*.
---
I don't support duping at all. I play private server and am content running my imaginary 'real Fallout' where jetpacked wierdos with marsupial don't exist. It's gritty, some critters are bullet sponges but I won't run about with a fraction of a health bar (although see the ridiculous benefit of bloody/uny). I don't need to as who the fuck is there to care but me. I don't burden public groups, and when I do I swap out for more META gear I keep to contribute in the way people need to in some events. 
---
However- when you *are* pushing for max damage (or fuck even a role play gun that Suits like a cowboy with a hectic fire rate lever action) its so disheartening to dump a ton into the Purveyor for a routine butt fucking. Without transmute options, it's not fair to land horribly off trait crap all the time.
---
How many fixers or handmades have you landed that are just one trait off perfect? Tons. I love when *zealots* is followed by godly perfect traits on the correct gun.
---
So yes, I understand the duping underworld for that reason. Give us transmutes/reroll and it'd probably DECREASE opportunistic people looking for the next dupe glitch.
---
This literally happens to me all day. Brand new PS4 with only FO76 on it, and a really good wired internet connection. Legit no idea why this happens to me but everyone says lag. Yeah maybe server side rubberbanding
---
So many have been traded now the only way to fix it would be to remove any legacies that have been traded recently, and ban the people who have clearly been duping
---
I'm working on a proposal to send them for a Serial Number system, each currently existing legendary item and apparel item would be given a unique Serial Number (other types of items are too hard to keep track of this way unfortunately)
---
Newly generated items from those categories would also receive a Serial Number, then if there is a massive influx of extremely rare items it would be flagged so the devs know that there's a dupe glitch, and will be able to delete any duped items based on their number
---
Legacies would be even simpler, since it's a limited pool a single new legacy entering the game would be flagged
---
Note: Work in Progress
---
You get it if you've played NW in the same session. I found out after a lot of experimenting, cos it was driving me *insane!*
---
Close the game entirely after playing NW and you won't get the random sounds that usually go along with NW tooltips when you're in Adventure Mode
---
Yep dupers are flipping everyone the bird trying to trade a clearly massively duped item for other god rolls. Then claiming, hey it ain't duped. I'm just lucky and had 5 BE15 Fixers drop this week!
---
Dude, you're talking about 2 dollars. Throw Todd a couple of bucks and you've got your Joe bundle.
---
**Doom Guy or riot**
---
Bloody and junkies if you want to build your character around it. I have a furious explosive that does the job. I use it as my main weapon for just running around but with a clip size of 20 I don't use it much on the queen.
---
Yes just put on the standard paint.  Not the strangler one.
---
The market needed this sadly was tired of seeing the market flooded with the same 100 post daily for a plasma or fixer we can all just play the game now and melt the bosses together hopefully they make a real challenge now
---
Is that really how you think this works? üòÇ
---
With a scrip cap of 1000, if legendary modules were 38 scrip (round up in the houses favour), i would need to roll 26 out of 26 as 3-star weapons to break a profit of *12 scrip!* And what's more is that it would take 7 days to scrip it all, in order to see that profit of 12 scrip..
---
Yeah, nah.
---
Even limited event rewards are worthless due to this trash.
---
Thanks for sharing this. I might have to give this a go!
---
I like going around in my tin foil hat and clean straight jacket eating dead bodies with cannibal.  I pull out a gamma gun and combined with the aforementioned details most people don‚Äôt want to pvp me, which is too bad lol
---
Mine won't work on either
---
A new one I discovered.   Throughout the entire game I can use my SS jet pack and never get high enough hurt myself but during Scorched Earth one blast of it sends me super high and I always die when I land.
---
Quarantine has fucked you up
---
Ok, sorry, was afk. Checking now.
---
Except they screwed everyone who put real effort into the game
---
I did everything they said to do on their troubleshooting page and still getting the same error. Glad I'm not the only one.
---
Lol, this is pretty good! Are you doing full-on RP? Or are you just playing the drug addict mechanically?
---
Every day we stray further from God.
---
Yeah, I admit there were problems with the market, but flooding and killing the market shouldn‚Äôt be the way it is changed.
---
Or 10000 mounted plans and white asylum dresses.
---
Ty for the laugh
---
She fucks me every time
---
This is a much needed post. I agree. Total bullshit. Math is supposed to add up
---
Yeah, Almost all items are about to lose a lot of value.
---
I think it should still be treated as, one day they might play more adventure, so having those rewards is nice.
---
Its just dumb Imo for them to keep adding stuff that nullifies the previous content they added.

 The 17 minutes is time until positive benefits from takings serum run out

You can take serums over and over to eliminate negative effects for a given time. 2 hr maybe?
---
I'm a level 440+ who hits workshop defense events when I'm bored and just to help. I swear I can taste the fear when I roll up on the poor level 15 getting wrecked by dogs just trying to hold down his little workshop. Like nah, not only do I have no interest whatsoever in killing you, I'm bout to throw about 5 lbs of plans at your feet when we're done. Now if only y'all would stop running away from paper bags!
---
Honestly, my mindset is just that its a bonus. Im an extremely casual player. I dont even really check what the next reward is or what activities give reward. I just get that nice dopamine boost when i see that xp bar in the upper right tick up
---
Today i got my first booster pack and was ecstatic. I imagine id be stressed out if i was shooting for it, but i also imagine id have gotten it days ago.
---
The only thing I can think of is that they're factoring in the Perk Packs you'll get from the Legendary Run.
---
YES
---
Level 50 is highest level of guns
---
Don't worry they added more onto it with the legendary run capping pretty much how much score is possible per day. 
---
Its hard to imagine they'll stop capping things.
---
Joining an active event, only to find that it is over the instant I arrive.  Why can't they just stop showing the event icon a couple minutes before it ends.  This would also prevent people from just joining at the end for the rewards and not doing anything.
---
The fast travel countdown when I am in "Hidden" and taking no damage.
---
The Healing Factor fast travel bug.
---
Serendipity proc'ing after I've already died.
---
VATS missing every first shot.
---
VATS locking onto the furthest possible target, ignoring the ghoul who is 3 feet away.
---
Dying at the end of an event and having to exit the server and rejoin with no rewards.
---
Not being able to cripple the SBQ.
---
Aiming my bloodied Fixer at the head of a weak enemy, watching damage numbers scrolling across my screen at 1k or more, and the enemy is still alive.  This happened earlier at the lighthouse on a *firefly.*

Some roach hiding in a trench 200 yards away at scorched earth robbing me of my sneak criticals.
---

---
Events where you kill the first wave and then enemies simply stop spawning.
---
I could go on all night lol.
---
Yep. Taking a break for awhile. Just logging in to check the atom shop and buy gold on Saturday.   I'm tired of grinding just to grind.
---
Well to be fair a Pistol should have nowhere near the stopping power of a Rifle or Shotgun
---
I earned my be15 plasma be90 flamer be15 Cryo and be15 Gatling laser my main four weapons I‚Äôve been using for 2 months now been playing since beta when they duped  the  tse stuff and most the stuff people are trading today legacy wise the market will fix itself but a new currency will emerge
---
There‚Äôs rumors that they are adding things like this.
---
In the road map it says we get ‚Äúinstanced interiors‚Äù (although that‚Äôs up to discrepancy of what it entails)
---
At least you still get the rewards,lol
---
You need to be rewarded? Lol I‚Äôm at a measly 800 hours. I don‚Äôt need to be rewarded for anything. What I need is a goal to work toward. 
---
When they initially announced legendary perks they said specifically it was so high level players have something to work toward. That is what ‚Äúthe fuck‚Äù I am talking about.
---
***250dr while reading intensifies***
---
Not all of them
---
Furious Less VATS cost Fat Man, so no, no I did not get any good rolls
---
Same. I have actually been timing myself and across multiple characters can usually get through the daily and part of the weekly challenges in about an hour, especially for the char I am still doing the reputation grinds with. Don‚Äôt think users bad at all...
---
Bleh. Well. Too late now i guess
---
Lol busted out laughing when you said ‚ÄúWard‚Äù
---
AND they still use stash space.
---
Dumptruck Duchess lolz
---
You make a valid point there, and I guess there will be a new emerging currency eventually. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, and have a nice night.
---
I approve of this message.
---
I am convinced they actually leak out the dupes every so often because some of them...who tf would think of them.
---
A positive post on this sub? Is that allowed?
---
I'm enjoying it too and i'm going for the plushies lol
---
True but it's still a game, and you should be able to make any build you want viable, I have some perks picked out for the build so far, best thing to do is see how it works out
---
You can join our discord, we have players on every platform of all levels. We also do community events and more!https://discord.gg/5Ps8pS
---
Reading this sub made me realize that lol
---
Toot toot
---
I agree, I've been trying to understand it all, but it does seem like alot. Hopefully they simplify it a bit.
---
If you are PC I have all 19 serums for sale in my vendors. 500 per.
---
You can‚Äôt sell or trade any bullion plans in any way. Also I believe this is English only sub. You‚Äôll have to grind it like the rest of us poor saps.
---
Edit- I may be wrong about English. If so, lo siento. Rest is true though.
---
I hate that the crossbow is useless.
---
I hate that you can‚Äôt use a bow in Power Armor.
---
Crossbows should be more powerful, but ONLY used IN Power Armor.
---
I have a Stalkers, +50% Limb Damage, Fast AP refresh Bow .... It is fantastic with a Plasma build.  I also have an Intstigating, something useless, Fast AP refresh Compound Bow with an Ultracite build.   It does a ton of damage but misses far too often.  I am hoping they fix the aiming like they did with the Gatling Gun back in the day, and the Instigating Compound Bow gets more useful.
---
I am really, really trying to play as an Archer, and am finding it difficult to get GOOD Bows, as no one sells them (except the crappy Crossbows), and ONLY the Purveyor drops them, and we all know what the crappy RPG rates of the Purveyor are like on stuff you might want to have.
---
Xbox.
---
This.
---
If you complete the Graham quest line, you get it for free. Just head down to their HQ in Ash Heap. Read the poster and finish the quest line.
---
Pistols are sub optimal.  No ap perk is why along with pistol perks sl being in agi. They can work but in all cases a rifle build would be better. 
---
Only a good idea if you want a harder road. Given how easy most of ther content in the game is, might be fun, but not at all powerful.
---
Makes since, I was playing it earlier to get some Christmas and Halloween stuff
---
Damn.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Nice job sir!
---
Just hit 49 rdy for my Hanging raider cage tmw!!!
---
Thank you :) I'm making a general store, now I know to keep it at one magazine rack lmao
---
Would totally buy that and put on sofia
---
Experiencing the same problem since the newest patch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Have whatever feelings you want about daily caps on scrip/gold/caps... But over half of the stuff here is just you not understanding some of the mechanics... Which is odd, since you like exploring the map. Just a few quick examples... You can continue to farm rep without the dailies, you put caps back in the vendor when you by plans, and you half to nuke areas that have the flux you want and the enemies that produce the drops needed to stabilize it.. Fissure Prime is good for Violet, WS and Charleston have plenty of Cobalt.
---
I just don't get why they added the worst part of MMOs before adding all the crucial MMO stuff that is missing. Like holy shit there is no text chat.
---
Yes, but there is no option to select my other characters? I‚Äôm very confused.
---
PS4
---
Tattered Field Jacket? I am intrigued!
---
I was around lvl 25 trying to sneak around Whitespring and probably the same Chad stomped up to me and waved me to follow him. He took me back to his camp, which was dope, showed me around, then stopped at his tinker bench and I thought he was done with me. But after a minute he dropped a bag at my feet with every serum and like ten weapons customized to my level. I still use the Fixer he gave me to this day (still haven‚Äôt found plans) at lvl 90. Unfortunately I had no idea what serums were for or what mutations were, so I just sold them all to Duchess. I never forgot that guy though, experiences like that shaped the way I interact with lower lvl players
---
I fast travelled back to my camp near the dropsite v9 and there was 3 legendary sb flying around
---
Cap limits for one, you can't sell good stuff if you're full on caps and many of the most coveted (and therefore most duped) items are worth far more than max caps even with the market full of dupes. Two, go look at the trading subs. You can only dupe if you **have** the thing you want to dupe, but multiply that thing other people also want and now you can trade for something else good you don't have. So these items make their way into the marketplace, just not via vending machines. Lastly, most dupers are smart enough to keep it on the down low and not advertise that they've got dozen of God rolls up for grabs by anyone who walks by. 
---
Play for long enough and be friendly enough to randoms and you'll definitely encounter someone who is duping or knows a duper or miraculously has some God roll handmade they'll give you cheap for no reason "just to be nice." These transactions don't happen by vending machines.
---
I have a rifle man at 195, and a heavy gun/ power armor at 175, I figured if I could get my hands on a instigating, vats enhanced, lucky, 10mm I could use that for stealth, and then ether a .44 or single action with furious, 25,25 it wouldnt be that bad of a deal
---
Its so you dont realize how horrible of an mmo and how much lack of content there actually is.
---
I would say contact support at that point or try deleting the game and re-download it. Also change your password.
---
Only thing i can think of is perhaps the other guy swapped armor/perks that 2nd go around to better tank.  
---
That or they healed the damage so fast it seemed like you were dealing less.  Nuka spam works that way.
---
I'd be surprised if it was any company but bethesda, they never fail to let you down. Why they didn't prepare for this I'll never know.
---
EDIT: I even made a support ticket, and they asked for the diagnostic report from the Bethesda launcher. Aparently their support isn't even aware that the game pass version doesn't use their launcher.
---
Thank you for the help!
---
I hope we can get something that will allow us to display power armor  in camp
---
Bro... how did u just realizeüò≠üò≠
---
I built over the crashed plane in the pond near by I loved it because the scream was far enough you didn't notice it at first
---
The Brotherhood of Steel will be so proud of us when they return!
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
But does it?
---
Was his namo
---
Sounds like its time to upgrade your camp!
---
No, it does not, in fact, "just work"
---
As does my VATS enhanced Troubleshooters railway rifle. Great for killing ghouls, and because the railway rifle is already low in VATS, I can fire more often in VATS.
---
I like this idea a lot. Having something even like helping defend the Wayward every now and then would do wonders. You‚Äôre definitely on to something.
---
The market is vertical right now. Gravity will take over and eventually spread outward.
---
By farming rep you mean praying to find a random encounter that gives 1/10 of daily rep? Fun.
---
By returning caps you mean only a fraction of what you actually pay so you always lose most caps when you buy something?
---
I know I have to nuke different areas, my problem stems from the fact that 99% of the time people nuke Fissure Prime and thus I have to do the boring silo to nuke something else while praying I don't crash to desktop or have to stop playing along the way.
---
I speak spanish and u were spot on:)
---
same here
---
Garrahan Mining Company is what you are looking for. Every train station should have the poster you need to read to start the quest. Fair warning though, you need to be level 25 to finish the quest and get the power armoe station plans.
---
You want rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman. You also want Concentrated fire to at least level 2. I also have tank killer and glow something that I switch between depending what I‚Äôm fighting. You need a 15 Perception for all of those. I also run Bloody Mess, Mr Sandman, adrenaline (when it‚Äôs not nerfed). 
---
Hope that helps.
---
I have an instigating western revolver I absolutely love, it one shots the moles at uranium fever with only Lvl 1 of each Gunslinger
---
The range is also 204 with the Long Barrel
---
All of that considered, I still think it's best as a sidearm for basic stuff, a Bloodied western might be viable for bosses though
---
Tired of the grind?  Lucky for you, new in the item shop legendary currency pack!  100 perk coins (thats +20 bonus coins!) only 49.99!
---
I was at the Whitespring Station and I searched a cigarette machine. Someone had dumped a shit ton of plans for crafting. I was like ‚Äúmaybe there‚Äôs something in here that I haven‚Äôt found that I could make.‚Äù 
---
Then I notice, ‚Äúoh, they have weight.‚Äù 
---
Then I think ‚Äúwait, it wouldn‚Äôt prompt me to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù it at the work bench if I had the plan?‚Äù
---
Next thing I‚Äôm looking through my inventory like ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm carrying a lot of notes that have weight!‚Äù
---
I guess the whole ‚Äúrepair kit‚Äù and ‚Äútear down kit‚Äù purchased in the game shop thing made me just go ‚Äúyeah, I‚Äôll buy repair kits but I‚Äôm not paying to craft‚Äù so I ignored all the plans thus far.
---
If you're online now pm me your GT and I'll join you and build one. Then I'll FT down to garahan mining HQ so you can follow me and complete the quest to make your own.
---
Yh its annoying as hell that they cap literally every currency you can get from vendors (other than caps of course) and lock the rest behind dailies but at the end of the day it's how they keep people coming back every day. 
---
An average day for me starts with getting all my buffs in order (basically just xp for the aforementioned perk grind) 
---
Then I run to do my dailes/faction missions(one of which is luckily perpetually bugged) 
---
Make sure my buffs are still going 
---
Sell my shit to the prospector and try to get a good SS roll
---
Edit my camp a little 
---
Farm atoms 
---
Transfer my Notes from events/dailies
---
Log off and regret the hours I've spent doing the same busy work I do everyday 
---
Log back on the next day 
---
Rinse Repeat
---
I should have just added "Mounted Plans" to my list.
---
Or the camp that I go to because it says 35 armor, only to find 1 armor and 34 ski hats.
---
So theres a new dupe out again I take it?(Thought the bans were from past behavior.)
---
Girlfriend and I just started playing tonight, both on Xbox one S' but only hers was lagging while mine ran fine on the same server.
---
Broooü§£ü§£ü§£
---
So in other words, you don't actually like to do any of things you were so gleefully praising not to long ago. K.
---
I will be on in about an hour and can help if your still on.
---
&gt;The RNG from crafting is the same for drops
---
It is not.  The very next day everyone would have god mode fixers.
---
Bloodied gauss pistol gets in the 700+ area which is one-shot-a-mutie range but it ain't no queen killer, that's for sure.
---
My camp is a box that usually doesn‚Äôt get placed because I haven‚Äôt done any building there even except the sign that let me get through the Wastelanders first mission at The Wayward.
---
Seriously, I was playing for a year before that ignoring my CAMP and pretty much all crafting.
---
I made a couple rad stag steaks to stop them from spoiling.
---
Same brother/sister. The literal grinding to level 100 for the SCORE keeps me away. I got the ammo exchanger.
---
That's not bad, just wish they made the alien blaster rounds more obtainable I think I'd enjoy that running around in the captain cosmos outfit
---
Oh yeah
---
So awesome, thanks for this! I wish I'd seen it a week ago when I was building my new camp lol. I have 4 characters with 4 awesome camps, none of which I want to rebuild dammit. I wanted to build a raider tower for the last one, but it was too chunky with the normal stairs and not enough usable space.. this.. would have been perfect. Anyways, take my upvote.
---
Newest pts build has all reg cards one point and cannot exchange gold cards now at all. They take the criticism and got opposite. Has to be on purpose.
---
for what I know she is burying his friend that need it the nany couse he was sick and not his brother
---
Solo para q sepas este "subreddit" es solo en ingles, asi q dudo q encuentres a mucha gente q hable espa√±ol
---
People selling ammo for anything more than 1 cap.
---
Doing the gold and rep grind
---
Getting absolute garbage from the purveyor
---
People downing the queen in mere seconds
---
Not being able to find vendors at player camps within 5 seconds of arriving
---
Pink wallpaper. Pink wallpaper! PINK WALLPAPER!!!!!!!!!
---
peoples are duping again?
---
damn, i think i will give up the game if they dont erase those duped stuffs
---
Railway Rifles are underappreciated beasts for Rifle/Commando builds. The recoil though makes VATS a must. I have a Quad/90%Weight one and a Furious/Explosive one and they are both amazing. Saving a Bloodied one for whenever I switch to Bloodied build.
---
I found a lot of exploits just playing the game without trying to find any exploit. But duping items is on purpose. So players who do it must get a permanent ban imho. From other side I wouldnt mind if everyone could get hands on energy explosive weapon  or legendary dragons for example. It is not fair that some of u have the best gear ONLY bcz u play since start. So maybe this madness should be this way: glitches, exploits, duping, godmode and finally the console command where u can get anything u want from this game bcz it will be never fair for new players legally. 
---
And i guess since morrowind we all could play our own version of bethesda games and this has never changed... offline/online doesnt matter.
---
They're still in all their regular spots in the Bog.  
---
Beyond that, can't say I've noticed either way.
---
Yup! Big one too, legendary weapons and rare items are the victim this time.
---
Thanks for the explanation, I appreciate it.  Makes sense now.  Here I was getting upset because I ALWAYS get shitty drops and pulls yet I'm seeing so many people wanting to trade amazing weapons.  Alas, unless the RNG gods favour me a world I won't get to play in.
---
Yeah exactly, I guess by viable I meant "would just let you get enough damage for rewards" :P
---
They are used to craft the gold bullion weapons and armor.
---
It is worth stockpiling a few if you plan on going with secret service or thorn armor or use the new gauss shotgun/minigun/pistol.
---
I praised how all ~400 locations were hand crafted and had a little story to it, I praised the cool overarching lore/story. Endgame is just doing the same few things over and over again with artificial time gating.
---
its live?
---
What
---
Yeah honestly the alien blaster needs a big upgrade, even The Vats Unknown is awful, Medic's effect scales with the damage dealt and since it's damage is so low I couldn't even heal my level 5 friend fighting ghouls enough to keep them alive
---
I figured oh hey I'll use it to help low level people, so much for that lmao
---
 No son intercambiables, solo puede obtenerlos comprando con lingotes de oro.
---
Double checked mine. Not bloodied but instigating quad. I'm one shotting almost everything. Also have an instigating 50%, limb damage deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Would yall be ok with these DeVS doing a hardcore 8 hour maintenance every Tuesday consistently?  because I sure would if it means fixing it and that just has not happend...maybe they suck at talent retention in the DeV department we are in the middle of a pandemic..either way somethings gotta give. Also ffs fix my gauss shotgun...why can't I sprint or use vats after i fire off two shots.
---
My friends tried to get me to play Path of Exile, a ftp game that has new seasons every three months. The game has been around for ten years or so and there has to be two dozen forms of 'currency' in that game now and you get completely overloaded and overwhelmed with it. No worries though, you can spend money to buy stash tabs that hold more currency and even sort it for you!   
---
   
---
I was enjoying the game enough but the monetization made me want to puke and the years of compounded mechanics made the learning curve too much for me.
---
They're used for Distant Thunder.
---
Okay :)
---
Naturesfunk
---
It's just a pity that it's one of a few truly unique guns and it ends up being bad
---
hahhaaha
---
Assaultron alert.  Be ready.
---
Thank you :)
---
I'm scaroused myself...
---
Same, not even bloodied and have almost a full unyielding SS armor set. Saving them for a rainy day if I decide to change builds - or if they let us trade bullion items eventually.
---
It‚Äôs pretty simple, you‚Äôre only options are PA or Chinese suit.  
---
I use 5 pieces of SS some w +25RR bonus, +15 SS underarmor, +90 for the backpack, pop a Radshield and it‚Äôs still useless in nuke zones.  So it‚Äôs Chinese for me.
---
My friends tried to get me into it and I reached a point where my stash was completely full of currencies and I needed to buy stash space to keep playing. Knowing they do sales I decided to wait three weeks for stash space to go back on sale. During those weeks I lost interest and dropped the game for good. Talk about creating problems to sell solutions, gee wiz.
---
Lol. That's actually pretty funny
---
How were you able to dupe them?
---
Problem with stealth is pistol and stealth perks all in agi. Something's gotta give.
---
In regards to leveling up as a high level. You can swap characters as a low level and level up with that character and it would progress your score. Just make sure to switch back when claiming any rewards.
---
At the end of the day you regret all the time you spent on it but then for some fucking reason in the morning it is all erased and you are ready to do it again. Damn it reminds me of my WoW days.
---
Nice, I have a DCGauntlet as well. Instigating, 50%Limb, 90%Weight. Instigating DCGs are great backups for non melee focused builds. Right now I'm rocking a heavy Gauss Minigun build because new hotness and it does insane damage output. I might switch back to commando soon though since that's really fun and I have a couple decent Handmades and those Railway Rifles.
---
The ammo converter works great for a single play session worth of spare ammo.
---
I think the Devs spend more time fixing the game than playing
---
Appears to be an issue with the Gamepass version of the game. Dozens of posts of others saying the same thing
---
I absolutely agree with that, when I first found it I was excited, but it just turns out a disappointment
---
I'm always surprised when they release that bundle with the skins for Alien Blaster and Security Baton, I don't think anyone actually uses them, although it would be fun to be able to
---
Figured the 9 in the damage and the other 6 in sneak and cover ops
---
First you join NW. Then hide in a bush üòÄ Now you are good. üëç
---
Joining you now
---
I used the baton and ran around in a cop outfit when the rioting starting, my friend busted out laughing
---
In the distance, Todd: 
---
‚ÄúDo whatever you want‚Äù
---
You can buy the plans in Watoga for 1000 caps.
---
I get that if there was no cap people would grind though it in less than a month but at the same time I wish they had atleast one of the games vendors unlimited. Be it gold or scrip it would make me feel less empty after each day
---
I played it solo/co-op with a friend in a private instance. About 300 hours over the course of a few months, after Wastelanders came out. Playing it that way made it feel like playing another single player fallout game, which is all I ever wanted. I am content.
---
Did you use any of them to store large numbers of items? Is it the first time youve logged in after a long period?
---
They wiped a lot of mules way back in their attempt to curb some of the duped gear. I lost a loooot of gear to that and only had like 4 of 1 gun (my fault for buying them, I thought it was a sound investment). Contacted support and they gave me the support equivalent of "whoops teehee, sorry nothing we can do!"
---
I mean uhhh have any screws? Those things are rare as pink dog turds apparently.
---
It really blows you can't trade them. I get (sorta) why they don't want us selling them in vendors, but item for item trades should be no problem.
---
How do you have the budget üòÇ?
---
Thanks, that's quite helpful.
---
I agree of course, and I upvoted.. But the majority people who do this, don't read reddit.. Or they wouldn't do it. I doubt they can read at all tbh.
---
Same here. Best I've done is the blue has mask and I get every create every time. Just blessed with bad luck
---
Meh, I'm a herbivore.
---
It says you're offline. And me an invite. My GT is the same as here.
---
I use the Friendly Fire perk to keep the brahmin at 100% health. Got the backpack plan after doing that.
---
The lost supplies only grant you more caps. Keeping both Brahmin at 100% health definitely increases your chances of getting the high tier rewards. Hopefully this helps some.
---
She is my side piece
---
Just add revolver rifle mods for more than just the pipe revolver!
---
I assume they will be adding more ways to get perk packs. Score already adds a few, so it's not JUST levels, still kinda crazy.
---
Yeah I hate when they make you work for things. Why can't they just give us everything instantly for free?
---
 I mean why spend time playing this game when I should get everything at once and be done with this game. Then I can move on to the next game.
---
Stupid developers.
---
Yeah, by uninstalling the game and leaving us the hell alone. Multiple problems solved, duper scum
---
Naughty boy lol
---
I got the flag the other day, and some guy was selling the backpack and the outfit in his vendor earlier. Wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a dupe (probably) so didn‚Äôt buy.
---
Okay omw
---
Are you on pc? I can throw like 20 or 30 your way
---
What idiot dupes like that on their main? That‚Äôs why you have an alt account lulz
---
A lot of rp opportunities would be opened up with more usable weapon types lmao, or even the ability to put skins on other items of that type
---
I can put my pint sized slasher knife skin on a machete and it just still swings like a machete, so stuff like that could work
---
Only issue is not knowing what weapon a person has in PvP, but they seem to be gutting PvP anyway
---
Most duped items are the most valuable stuff.  They sell it for real money.  Dupers have no interest in caps.
---
Well hope they ban you trash

Polly could give rumors of treasure once a day, passing on stuff she heard. And as a bonus consequence, the dailies could be tied to what body you got her. Best body, best quests. Crappy body, lower reward or harder enemy quests.  
---
  
---
Duchess, choice of deliver 10 bottles of a standard alcohol or deliver 5 bottles of a special brew from a recipe Biv gives in his dailies. Rewards a random recipe.  
---
Mort, check on some settlers who bought his tapes. Maybe a piece of equipment is broken and needs fixed, maybe they need some extra tutelage, or maybe they come under attack when you get there. Rewards a random camp plan.  
---
Sol, nearby enemies need taken care of. Rewards a random weapon or armor mod or plan.
---
ok
---
Make it a commando with powerful auto receiver
---
Thats what I mean its kinda Dookie that those are the only options even when you have the full endgame armor set.
---
You can pick something from my vending machine its not much
---
No. If you want the tricentennial items, you'll have to pay for the tricentennial upgrade for your PC account.
---
Yeah I am, I play on steam. I was mostly joking however, you keep those for yourself, they‚Äôre the real bullion.
---
I'm in the same boat. Just under 500 and can't give stuff away fast enough. I think a general rule is most players over 200 have done the pvp thing long enough that they just want a bigger fan base, as the other poster mentioned. Keep spreading the joy!
---
Maybe the legendary ‚Äúwhat rads‚Äù perk will help but not holding my breath
---
Well if you need anything I can do my best to help &lt;3 I'm only level 77 but i like helping people out in this game.
---
It's easy because the game is an reused single player game with an online element cobbled on instead of a game designed from the bottom up as an online game.
---
For free? I was talking about time gates and mindless grinds.
---
I don't mind working for stuff, I mind when you are limited how much you can "work" every day. Instead of spending 2 hours every day for a week why can't I spend 14 hours one day a week?
---
Mindless grinds are not difficult nor challenging, they are tedious. Skill should be valued over time spent.
---
Damn homie u smart as fuck
---
36.  Doing all the dailys, finished the weeklies except one this week.  Only doing the easy NW ones, maybe one out of 3.  Grinding about 70-100K xp daily.  Builder team, herbivore, Brain Fungus Soup/Cranberry stuff/berry mentats/Shielded Vault Suit/Unyielding.  INT 40'ish.

That‚Äôs awesome but no one can replicate them big booty cheeks
---
If there ARENT BoS dollars I'll buy you a price of perfectly preserved pie.
---
That‚Äôs what I do as well, still nothing though :(
---
I have it. Give me 30 min and I'll be back online.
---
I write business software for a living. Not the same as games, but software development lifecycle is my job, and some things hold true across the field.
---
As promising as that is, sadly it's never enough. A handful of the worst offenders get banned and everybody else goes free. Which just encourages them to cheat next time an exploit comes up because they know they'll get away with it
---
Here‚Äôs hoping the BoS patch will give PA a breathe of life, I‚Äôm praying for legendary mods üôåüèæ
---
A miserable little pile of secrets...
---
Your math is off.
---
It's 1500 levels to upgrade 6 perks to max.
---
But I do agree with you, no more than 1500 levels to upgrade all 27 Legendary Perks to max.
---
Yes they need to make reviving dead players with 4 nuke codes a thing as well as pining targets.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are complaining so much about duping. Most of y‚Äôall complained about this game being multiplayer and wanted private servers. Now, how someone else plays the game it all of a sudden effects you?
---
No he straight up said ‚ÄúFrankie‚Äôs death‚Äù
---
I see that one of your dailies is bugged as well. I was totally fine with it, you just show up and get the treasury notes. But now the other one is bugged too, but it's in a bad way. I can't get it to start, or turn anything in. I guess that's the universe balancing itself out?
---
I believe its the latest NI. v 3.5
---
Sure but instigating won't do much on a 10mm cause low base damage.  Bffr or jffr will do more work. With a 10mm.
---
Only pistols instigating is good for can't be silenced.
---
I appreciate the offer. Just pay it forward when you become a high level with too much stuff üëç
---
Bethesda's response to it was:
---
4:8:2000
---
That's a common problem. Often, the code for these skins and atom shop items are added before they're "unlocked." But for one reason or another, it is unlocked. Happened with the keg, deathclaw topiary, mothman wallpapers, etc. Without ever having to buy them.
---
Thanks for the info. I guess I am far behind on rep since ward wasn't giving me rep for the longest time.
---
Pretty sad I could do a playthrough of 4 with just the 10mm
---
Ok, but have you seen giraffes? 
---
I'm in.
---
That‚Äôs amaZing
---
That‚Äôs a cool knife
---
Yes, it is. The legendary effects randomization for a three-star drop is the same as the randomization of legendary effects for a current craftable legendary weapon like the Gauss Shotgun. 
---
Fixers do ***not*** drop in the wild. Which is why I chose to say ‚Äòdrop‚Äô and not ‚Äòroll‚Äô. That ***EXCLUDES*** Mama Murmrgh from the equation.
---
Or a plate filled with doughnuts or a doughnut display counter that is already filled with all types of doughnuts and pastries

What platform you looking at?
---
... I think y'all should see a psychiatrist
---
I've run it at least 50 times, always finding all the supplies and healing the brahmin. only have the caravan outfit.
---
It sucks big time. Has Bethesda said if they're going to do anything retroactive for everyone effected?
---
Isn‚Äôt it kinda like the Father Winter Helmet paint issue?
---
No one has ever said this before /s
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Yeah I remember killing like 6 dudes one run, and died mid game, and knew that if I had just sat in a bush I would have gotten more points.

This game grew on me so fast and than I just kept getting my time stolen from me with these dupes and more and more I could care less.

Remove 1k, throw them on the ground.  Repeat.
---
I never thought I'd see the day. I gotta say, you've made me 180 on blueprints; I used to think they were worthless, but they're damn useful for fixing silly issues with building. I still think they're useless for their intended purpose, but I digress.
---
use em while you can.
---
Lvl 29.
---
Casual player. I join to event teams. I do NW dailies, but not always (like I skip this 9 creature killing one). One day I got the challenge bug, lost 1250 score. I still need 1 weekly (NW one) from this week.
---
It's like a part time job with no pay. The gold and season pass grind has me not playing this week.
---
Seems the same to me.
---
Outfits bought in the atomic shop cannot be sold. But if you were to craft a VTU jumpsuit for example you could sell that.
---
Put skins on ur weapon it helps them not  disappear
---
Yea, Sierra Madre.
---
Yes. Especially if you just paid for the recall card...
---
Happens to me too, no idea why.
---
I don‚Äôt fear much in nuclear winter but I do fear nuke launches. Let‚Äôs make those happen more.
---
Each perk card you scrap gives you 1 point. To level a single card it takes 100/150/200/200 per level. I didnt count the number of legendary perks but to level 1 takes 450 perk cards - that's 2250 perk cards to max the 5 slots your given. 1 perk card per level and a bonus 4 every 5th level... yeah I can see 1500 levels to max all. That doesnt include the one point to remove a card if you want to switch your build.
---
Gotcha...thanks
---
As compared to when it first came out? It‚Äôs more stable and that means I can play the game with my best friend who lives a few hours away is the main selling point for me.
---

I lose rads alot even when i dont die. Randomly just have more health
---
Happy cake day
---
Duping isn't the problem. Bethesda making it near impossible to get the gear you want is the problem. If I could just spend 1,000 scrip for one fully custom item, I'd be happy. But no. Bethesda has created a market for duping, due to their own flaws and greed.
---
The science behind it disagrees.  Look up "forced scarcity".   It's a pretty common (if manipulative) sales tactic.  Been around a long time too, I can remember my mom getting jeans from the department store's sale.  "Limit 2 per customer" at the sale price, they knew full well moms would hand their kids some cash to buy 2 for them (or go through the line several times) but it makes people buy more than they would have due to "fear of missing out".
---
I need screws. Badly.
---
No problem!
---
Send a ticket to Bethesda Support, make sure to describe the problem as precisely as you can: what's troubling you, what lead you to this situation, etc etc. I'm sure they'll be able to resolve your problem very quickly.
---
I am lvl 291 with 1 character and no fo1st :p
---
Level 251 one character. Filthy casual.
---
There is a buff from being well feed which gives you added health, I think +25. When your hunger drops to 74% you loose that buff and your over all health drops 25. But as bloodied you only loss 5 HP. But that is noticeable at very low health levels. Enough so that it can kill you if you health is too low.
---
I have 2 accounts, 5 characters each.  I have 5 playable characters, lvl 357, 323, 255, 180, 177.  The others are mules.
---
I‚Äôve gotten so many back packs and outfits you cucked yourself out of them if you really wanted to buy
---
Yeah the quality of the game dramatically dips once you have a developed character, and have toured the world.  Almost as if they designed it like any other FO game rather than the MMO that ita supposed to be.
---
This is my favourite üòÇ

Same as I‚Äôm using now. 72. Yes.  I need to respec that as the guide I used isn‚Äôt as good as I thought it would be.

What is this about?
---
fallout, fallout never changes.
---
every few weeks a new exploit is public, if you are lvl 300+ and active in this sub or any other Community there is likely no chance you missed the previous ones. I claim this is the fault of Bethesda, since they don't care much about bug fixing or making this game any better, implementing huge and annoying grinds that let the players find other ways to get to their desired items or goals instead of just playing the game as it is intended from Developer side. Would the Legendary Run not beeing such a big pain in the ass, they most likely won't search for workarounds. if we are able to get to our most wanted loot faster then relaying on pure rng we would have little to no dupe exploits - sure, there would be some guys trying to exploit just to feel cool, but who would care if we have legit ways to get what we want?
---
Oh tru I somehow didn't see how you decided to not go plasma caster after all
---
Next Thursday!
---
Still thats 15 perk packs give or take. That's around 60 points, not even enough to level a card to level 2 (you need 100)
---
Whats this SS you speak of?
---
i had decent luck dropping basically at vault tec university and killing the ghouls nearby.
---
That's awesome!!! Thank you for the information
---
Sometimes you get on a team with someone and without even talking you know they are your kind of person. I love this. Some people it‚Äôs like they are just a fast travel point and a shared card. But some people become your best friend for an hour.
---
I haven‚Äôt bought bought anything with gold yet as I just unlocked it and need to do some research.
---
I just want the blank billboard.
---
Put a Prime Automatic Receiver on it. The Fixer is a "premium" weapon and should be used as such. I only use my babies when I do a silo run/scorched earth or enter really high level areas such as Tanagra Town, West tek and white springs 
---
Fun fact: if you have a 3* Fixer putting a Prime reciever on it makes it a "5*" weapon.
---
I'm at almost 1100 hours and at 280, 1500 levels is ludicrous.
---
What serums do you want or need? I'm on xbox and can make you some free of chargeüòä
---
I just created a new character and level him up once a day to get that last challenge done. At low levels, the grind is remarkably brisk. I just do two or three events and it's done. When eventually he gets too high in levels for this to be practical, I'll delete him and create a new character for this purpose. Easy-peasy.
---
I mean really.  How out of touch can they be?  It's essentially just saying "here's a system no one will ever use!".   
---
I'm not even level 200 and I started in beta.
---
Do the different characters have the same score progression? Cause now I have one character 170+ lvl, but I am thinking to get the second one to farm this level up rewards easier:)
---
please, the engines roots are back to the 90's. since 23 years the engine is patchworked like frankensteins monster.
---
I've burnt through all my scrips for Unyield/WWR secret service chest since the beginning of the wastelander, still haven't gotten it yet. this is painful.
---
Other than the usual spots in the bog, I always run into one at the fissure site near Whitesprings, as well as the one up near the pumpkin house in the savage divide. 
---
Other than that, I rarely run into them.
---
It's almost as if you responded to an entirely different post.
---
Everyone with a pc can test now, actually. They made it so two patches ago iirc.
---
No stars on the lever action yet.  If I recall correctly it‚Äôs only level 45.
---
The shotgun has two stars and does extra damage against scorched.  To be honest I use it most often because not many things survive a double barrel unloaded in their face. 
---
No secret service armor yet.

You mean Atom

Get one month of fallout 1st, just store everything in in and once it runs out you can still access the junk. Trust me, its worth it.

I fell in love with the Train Car, I hope they do more Train related items for this game, when I first started out I found a boxcar that was mostly empty and built a camp in it, had I had this caboose it would have been perfect!
---
What PA are you using?
---
Mama Murmrgh is a milf.
---
Change my mind.
---
The engine is old and was only designed to be singleplayer. That aside, Bethesda also did a horrible, rushed job making it multiplayer and because of that  the game has a plethora of bugs, and will have them for a good long while. It will take years of patching before we stop seeing inventory bugs (duping, vendor stealing, etc) on a regular basis.
---
I second this solution. Works every time!
---
They would have to increase the amount you can script per day in that case.. I‚Äôm always logging my alt cos my stash is literally full of 3* exterminator gauss minis.. While I‚Äôm here the new heavies need a buff ü§®

She has a partner who lives downstairs at the Rusty Pick.  Pity.  I like husky maidens in leather and rubber.

You on right now?
---
I'd be happy with just some extra mod slots or new mods at this point.
---
Yeah same, just installed and same display issues and servers not available. Going to see if I can find where the config .ini is and manually make changes. Yeah so the display res in the config file (C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\my games\\Fallout 76) for some reason was  3840x1620, manually changing 1620 to 2160 fixed it. Now just the server issues.
---
You can at least take comfort in the fact that Gauss Weapons (Excluding the regular rifle) and SS armor can't be de-valued by cheaters
---
Several Far Harbor Assets Are In The Files.
---
Y'know, I always did wonder why the wastelanders bothered with caps as a currency when bullets are a thing.  
---
On topic, +1 on the 5.56 being an unofficial currency for transactions that exceed cap limit.  Though, I think .45 also can be considered as such too.
---
What exactly are legendary modules? And there purpose
---
Those should have completely new perks, because the old ones would me PA's OP.
---
But I don't think it will happen. Even Beth knows that they can't balance this.
---
I love the fact that it's multiplayer, so that doesn't apply
---
It effects people because there are those of us who have put real time and effort into the game, which any garbage person can now cheat and surpass in minutes
---
I personally refuse to cheat, I'm going to keep playing until the end of the season, if the duped items aren't deleted by then I'm finally done with 76
---
You are in modify,
---
Correct?
---
I had a level 5 run up and punch me before fleeing. I'm level 82 and just laughed. It was like the scene from Finding Nemo. "I'm going to touch the butt."
---
I'm sure they put an explanation of that in the manual. Oh... wait there is no F76  manual...
---
Even 1500 would be pretty extreme considering your character is basically done perks wise at 100, and if you aren't focused on xp grinding (which really has no tangible reward) it would take thousands of hours to get these perks maxed.    
---
That is 100% stupid.
---
No
---
Not broken but yeah, they never lined up properly.
---
I always made it work with some stairs and roof tiles or scaffolding
---
Also can we just can the whole vault steel thing? Being able to roll one piece of solar armour every two days is a joke. I've gotten all the plans but in the same time rolled one viable piece to wear.
---
I saw in another thread that the game works if it's on your OS drive. You can try to hit the windows key and go into Apps and Features then choose Move but that option was greyed out for me so I'm trying to reinstall on C:
---
Oh, you need to be In modify to add paint
---
No but I will be soon. TheHollyKing562
---
Exactly. Throughout my levelling process I haven't even paid attention to which perks I got duplicates of,  I guess I lost a lot of them too. And I played around with builds switchung points even more, so yeah, it's a ton of lost "perk coins". At level 456 (on pts, they copied my char's backup from two days ago, I guess. I'm level 487 atm) I was barely able to afford one fully upgraded perk.
---
That‚Äôs too much. Thanks. I no longer want to do this.
---
I have gone into modify also and it does not appear
---
it is nowhere
---
Just your your well fed and / or thirst quenched bonus wearing off.
---
I‚Äôm more annoyed by how using radaway gives me 30 Rads before taking them away...I‚Äôve died many times to that
---
Honestly its Bethesda that encourages customers to cheat in my opinion.. I personally don't care if they do or do not myself. Like i said if Bethesda bothered to fix anything and didn't cheapen out on a archaic game engine designed for singleplayer we'd have none of these issues.
---
Wade IX
---
Invite me when you get on.
---
Never? 
---
What makes you think they will change this?
---
a lot of the bugs are client-side. fallout 76 is mostly a multiplayer mod for fallout 4, which is literally completely inside fallout 76.
---
adding a Multiplayer net-code and other additional codes doesn't make the engine itself better, worse or anything else - the engine is kinda just a tool. but there is a difference if you use bad tools which are highly modified for over 20 years, where alot of people worked on which aren't in the company anymore and no one knows what they did, patched and workaround in several dozen ways - or if you have quality tools which are new and well planed, organized and not full of internal errors.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt work.
---
would anyone be mad if i was trying to work a solution like its the lewd quadratic formula. im sure that giraffe is the key integer...
---
Nope its a huge disappointment I know the feeling
---
Where did you get the (caboose) Train Car?
---
You need to click on the piece of power armor, and the painted one should be an option
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
---
^(No I don't care that it's the wrong game this time.)
---
At the end of the Wastelanders content, you get the new currency of Gold Bullion. Gold Bullion can be traded in at three different places to gain new plans that aren't available anywhere else, and most are superior to older weapons and armor in the game. To craft most of these, you need one Legendary Module per item crafter. The item crafted will be a legendary, with a chance of it being 1, 2, or 3 stars. You can not choose which effects you roll, but *only* the base item. So 150 Scrip a day can mean anywhere between three 1-star legendaries or three 3-star legendaries, depending on RNG. These items are all character-bound, untradeable, unsellable, and unscrappable. They can either be kept, destroyed, or sold to the Legendary Machine thing for Scrip.
---
I hope that explains it, without giving too much away
---
Take your upvote and get the hell out of here.
---
It's not the paper bags, it's the PAs. Or the creepy Fasnacht masks. Or the bighuge guns. A combo of these. Take your pick. xD
---
On a more serious note, with communication being as gimped as it is in this game, it's no wonder people are scared of other people, especially when it's a new player vs a lv9000 veteran, especially in an actual PvP zone.
---
Yes.
---
What's your gamertag? I may have a solution.
---
There was probably a significant amount of stuff that was supposed to go up there. I find carnberry bog and the mire have very suspicious large patches of open land in certain places. I suspect they started running out of time and had to cut some stuff out. 
---
I always had a dream of putting in some trenchs in the bog. Place down a settlement and building inside the dips to do makeshift trenchs. However, I always found that they were either too small to place stuff that wasn't awkwardly floating, or there just wasn't enough room to do something proper. 
---
For some reason I feel like trench warfare would fit the freestates immensely well.
---
Bunch of people have the same issue, which region are you in out of interest just in case it's country specific. I'm AU based.
---
There is a glitch that allows you to trade it
---
I've done that when I unlocked the blue camouflage it appeared but not this one for some reason
---
Thanks:(
---
Good job.
---
I thought the sameü•∫
---
I can understand why they don't have legendary PA pieces it would make PA super OP. Maybe legendary frames or underarmor would make more sense. I think additional mod slots would be better at least for the torso pieces. Also they need some decent mods for the arm pieces the current ones are pretty useless unless you're an unarmed build.
---
US here. I tried a VPN to try a connection from a different region and got the same thing.
---
Never.
---
This is what has been wrought by duplication and exploits. They say it doesn't hurt us, but we are progressively having our gameplay restricted  with both permanent and temporary measures due to the tiny e-peens of these losers who can't even play a game well without relying on cheating üòÇ
---
The hardhats with lights on them can be modded bright, blue, purple, red. I think there is a vaultboy mod as well.
---
Lah!
---
the only thing that would help is allow the comunity to create private servers (on their own server, not this 1st crap) and enable mod support for these. bethesda isn't willing to fix their game or improve it, all they care is squeezing more money out of it - which prevents the modsupport and private servers in the first place, sadly.
---
I just wanna know where all these dupes are??? Dropping them quad explosive handmade‚Äôs at??? Or them 10mm smg. Ahhh that would be nice!!
---
But how does it effect you? I‚Äôm genuinely curious how someone having a certain weapon effects your gameplay whatsoever? 
---
Also, there is no ‚Äúeffort‚Äù put into getting weapons. I‚Äôve played since BETA killed many 3* and got shit all. It‚Äôs all RNG luck, not effort.
---
I actually didn't know this lol
---
On if you still need help. 
---
Soonerbldr
---
Secret Service armor. Plans can be bought after completing the wastelanders questline.
---
...you buy repair kits? What a waste of money
---
they need to do hardware ban too, for the consoles, if possible.
---
Ridiculous.
---
2 that I actively use and 2 mules.
---
I dunno. Probably every other item in the game. We were able to trade the free radicals mask
---
Frankie's House of Fear?
---
Yeah
---
Switch to another weapon and back, that fixed it for me
---
Readjusting the cap from 2000 to 100k is basically admitting ‚Äúye we wanted to add yet another cap but oh no you caught us in this act so here you are, actually have a (basically capless) system for once üò¨
---
I've put hundreds of hours into farming items, trading with other people, and gathering valuable items
---
Everything I own is now worthless, and people who have put absolutely no effort into anything can have whatever they want
---
Therefore it effects me by making all of the time I've spent in the game worthless for the sake of people who probably barely play
---
Thanks but I literally can‚Äôt equip any of them
---
If you don't call that effort you're just wrong
---
Yeah this post is super reaching. What currencies are there that actually matter? 
---
1. Caps.
---
2. Gold Bullion.
---
3. Atoms.
---
4. Legendary Scrip.
---
Am I missing anything? This is nothing. 
---
Try looking at WoW or something which literally has dozens of currencies. I'm just thankful that they don't take up inventory space.
---
ive been playing since right after the beta era, and im a lvl 145. i am floored when i see you 200+ lvl guys. wtf are yall doing? literally. i cant seem to find enough shit to do to motivate me to play that far, and for what? youre pretty much end game tier by 75 (if you want options to swap around). fo76 is an adequately sized multiplayer mostly online grind production game or AMMOGPG. seeing how bethesda considers fo76 a financial success, we'll be using that acronym more often in the near future.
---
I've had this happen before, had to reboot and then load up again and it was fine. But isn't it just the cherry on top of the single most buggy game ever.
---
on the other side there were posts complaining about players who duped legendary modules to craft their armor, weapons etc.
---
guys who done so made a spreadsheet where they needed about 2500 modules for a single SS armor piece with unyielding, ap and sentinel. For a Bloodied fire rate weight reduction Gauss Minigun it took about 3500 modules. at least are these numbers what i remember, i can't find the post with the spreadsheet anymore sadly. non or less, these numbers are insane and totally out of reality.
---
You can‚Äôt equip them? Hmm... that‚Äôs new to me... try relogging?? Normally it lets me equip and then just says I don‚Äôt have ammo
---
Those weren‚Äôt tied to a progress- or time-gated resource like gold bullion.
---
My only issue with it really is that it significantly decreased the atom prizes. I could grind daily/weekly challenges and save up atoms to buy a bundle I really like; I don't like spending money on cosmetics.
---
They should add this automated nuke as an actual feature. Maybe have an event week where nukes happen at a certain time every day on every server... oh wait no maybe that‚Äôll actually put pressure on a paper bag like server.
---
Alright. I‚Äôll try that thank you
---
Arrgh! Ty!
---
The NCR actually back their currency with gold later, so it's kind of NV related
---
This was happening to me the other day and it was cracking me up.  Every time I interacted with something it made that noise. Really weird.
---
Yeah it's looking like we (Gamepass users) got our own unique Fallout 76 game-breaking bug.
---
Healing factor? :)
---
Same build, I recently started swapping tank killer for glow sights just for that event and hot back to one shotting things. Those ghouls are way overpowered for "40"
---
Don‚Äôt take workshops. It will open you up to PVP and high levels will just take it from you.
---
Its a prefab released with the new slocum joes pack!

---
Probably when they decide to conclude the story - or at least stop development and put the game on life support until it's fully shut down. Newer and newer currencies are pretty much a staple of MMOs, it's how they ensure "new" content is indeed "new" and that nobody can proactively farm everything. So don't expect not getting new currencies as we go on.
---
Of course, MMOs with actual common sense have a more proper decicated currency part of the UI that lists them *all,* together with the limits you can store and obtain in a given period of time. Then again, those MMOs probably also roll out an older currency or two from time to time.....
---
I got you. Gamertag the same as here?
---
Its an issue with the game engine. Plus its kinda hard trying to manage so many items with so many players.
---

---
If you‚Äôve traded with people then you can‚Äôt say duping hasn‚Äôt helped you in some way because more than likely those items you traded for were duped at some point.
---
Yea... sadly I spent around 25 hours + on the old location before I learned this.... 
---
I got around 60+ ski outfit plans....
---
I had it happen when emerging from Dyer chemical sewers. I also encountered a glitch, where I was taking damage as a conduit, long after encryptid was done. These are old glitches, you'll randomly come across them now and again.
---
is the cellar not opening, or, what's the problem?
---
People: I wanna earn stuff instead of buying it! 
---
Also People: it‚Äôs too hard to earn the stuff I wanna earn make it easier!
---
Then People: it‚Äôs too easy so all the stuff I earn has no value! 
---
People be people
---
I‚Äôm like unable to move when I join him to help
---
Yeah, tech debt will kill you. But that's a result of bad process. Not enough documentation. Arcane coding styles. Stuff jury-rigged to get it done now, and "we'll fix it later." Starting fresh on a new platform clears that away... for a while. If you don't fix your process, you'll be right back in the same boat soon enough. 
---
It's possible to have well-designed, maintainable code that was started years ago, and a fresh codebase that is already on the downward slide.
---
And, it‚Äôs fucking pixels on a screen, if they‚Äôre so valuable, maybe you should re-evaluate your life if someone duping makes them worthless to you.
---
Are you PC? If youd like I could give you some cool stuff
---
I had 3 on my xbox doing maybe an hour after work every day. I have 2 on pc, all day during COVID
---
Charisma doesn‚Äôt affect reputation, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. Charisma can be used during speech Checks during certain conversations. Which in return can help you get more caps, items, etc. But no to answer your question no.
---
I actually got back in becasue of a stash sale. Started a new character with the Scion and had fun playing with Storm Burst and got to level 60+ in just a few months, three times as my first character as a Ranger. Then I started playing other stuff and haven't played for over a year. It's a free game, I didn't play it for 1000 hours like I have 76, but a few bucks for a bunch of stash was worth it, *unlike Fallout 1st.*
---
If you‚Äôd like I can make and mod a max level fixer, it‚Äôs not much but it will be free. Also I read further down that you didn‚Äôt know what prefix of weapon you were looking for, but I gotta say I‚Äôve been really impressed with furious for a regular old build, it doesn‚Äôt require anything specific to use it properly, and because it‚Äôs not junkies or bloodied you can find them reasonably priced.
---
Update: Still can‚Äôt equip.
---
Now I can, I equipped grenades &amp; then dropped them and for some reason that fixed this lol
---
I appreciate that. I have the Fixer Plans so i suppose i could look into doing that myself
---
Are workshops like this open thing anyone can take or do they belong to people
---
The newly crafted sets have the branches show thew the paints
---
Ps4 :p
---
did you already do the freddy fear's basement quest? it could be just glitching you out. normally (without quest) the basement is empty. conflicting data loads breaks the game.
---
[edit: words]
---
Yeah. If you had yours from the raid the paints work properly. All sh sets crafted after wasetlanders have the branches show threw the paint
---
Ohhh that's great. I still need to convince my brother to play 76 dx
---
It takes the same amount of EXP to level from 50-99 and the same amount from 100-999.
---
But even though OP's math is wrong, it's still a pretty ludicrous grind.
---
Explosive getting sounds op
---
Yeah i'm where you are at. The bullion, rep and scrip grind is the worst. It's like they don't want me to play more than and hour or two a day. Those are things i wouldn't bother capping.
---
Even if i do build up scrip for legendaries, if i get a bunch of bad items, i can't sell them for caps if i've reached my 1400 cap, can't get more than 200 scrip back from them and can't scrap them. Terrible system.
---
You pay caps to claim them. Then if someone wants to take it, they come to the workshop and dispute it. You can keep it if you defeat them before it switches ownership. 
---
I find it usually not worth it. Let them have it. Log to a new server and take the same exact workshop on that one instead.
---
dupe yourself 100
---
I'll agree with you, it probably has, but I would rather it hadn't
---
And I'm not one of these people with 10 legacies and crap, I have no legacies, but I do have some decent fixers and other weapons and a few armour sets, which are all now worth literally nothing to anyone in the game because everyone can have perfect weapons, some that shouldn't exist in the first place
---
kid's ghost was angry, radiation is also a sign of angry spirits in the game, which is why the Torrence House gives off radiation at around 01:00-03:00 am...
---
/s (jk, no idea, glitches are so damn common, gotta try to make them fun for sanity sake)
---
What is it doing in there? Damn! I refuse to buys Bundle just for one item. Especially now that Free Atoms are so rare!
---
i agree, but for the Creation Engine in it's current state is little to no hope they get this done.
---
bethesda needs a fresh, clean and maintained Engine for their further games, knowing that ESO6 will also use the Creation Engine probably even more modified scares me a little, but i will wait untill i can put my hands on it to judge. For now, seeing how dissapointed players were with FO4 in 2015 which looked like a game from 2010, followed by FO76 were i played from B.E.T.A (Break it early test application was a hilarious self burn) till now i highly doubt that bethesda is putting any effort into the Fallout Franchise anymore. from what i know, they only have the license for one more Fallout game, at least from a report dated on 2017 where i heared that bethesda only have the license for NW, FO4 and FO5 - idk if FO76 is this FO5 or if they changed the agreement.
---
Edit: bethesda now have all rights for the fallout franchise:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Exclusive\_Licensing\_Agreement](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Exclusive_Licensing_Agreement)

---
I sent you the message asking for a game invite:)
---
Some people claim it is caused by staying on a world where your Camp couldn't be placed - especially if you are loading in where your camp *should* be. But personally I've had this happen to me mid-session while staying on one world. I've also had it once shortly after restocking my vendors.
---
It is anecdotal evidence **at best**, but the only suggested workaround I have seen so far is to never stay on worlds where you camp couldn't be placed if you are loading in to where your camp should be. Anywhere else seems to be fine.
---
As I said, not a fix and it definitely isn't the only cause of the problem, but I have had it happen *less frequently* since I started following that advice. Still, it is only anecdotal.
---
[Please for all our sakes remember to submit a bug report! üñ§](http://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10?prod=1129&amp;cat=287)
---
Aw, well at least they were thinking of us lol.
---
That‚Äôs the best ‚ÄúI swear I didn‚Äôt trade/buy a duped weapon‚Äù story so far
---
I'll see if I like pvp or am even good at the game haha thanks for the heads up
---
I like to shoot things
---
I think a lot of effort needs to be put into making PA stronger or at least more useful then they are currently
---
The public teams is fun I just tried it out. And the legendary run is interesting
---
I'm at 2k hours with a level 290 and 250. 
---
I've never seen anyone over 1200 so far.
---
Some people may not like this idea, but I just created a new toon and use it to level on days I'm not going to play much.  Can get a level really quick.  Also, I do not think what is current will be what is released with leveling legendaries.
---
I see a lot of people are commenting on moving your little camp device around. I was told they spawn close to your vendors.
---
I actually did something similar when I was lower level. For some reason I thought you learned the plans as soon as they were rewarded or when you picked them up . I was about level 25 before I realized I had an inventory full of unlearned plans. Don't remember how much weight it was.
---
I thought something was off when i found the witch costume in the same spot i found my ski outfit plan. Guess ill keep checking it some more for the others. Ty
---
It works for armor pieces that are not legendary, but crafted legendaries like ss will not work.  But if you just wanted a thousand leather arms for some challenge or another,  I think that works.
---
This applies to weapons too, so if it needs a legendary module in its recipe, super duper doesnt work.
---
Just an addendum: armors are 1 module, weapons take 2 modules per craft/roll
---
I would change up your Endurance and Intelligence. There are far better perk cards in the Endurance tree (i.e. Fireproof, Rejuvenated, etc.) and you would fair better moving some of those points over to other stats.
---
With Intelligence, unless you‚Äôre really worried about gun deterioration, you can run 3* Nerd Rage! and 2* Gunsmith. You only need 2* Gunsmith for modding pistols (and I believe Science and/or Science Expert for the Gauss Pistol). If you‚Äôre not worried, you can even run 3* and just swap over to Gunsmith when you need to mod.
---
I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Strong Back, as Unyielding gives you a decent boost in carry weight and the points in Strength can go toward better perk cards like Blocker, Bandolier, etc.
---
I would highly recommend Serendipity, as there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll break sneak using a Western Revolver and a 45% chance to reduce incoming damage is hard to pass up in those situations. When I ran a stealth commando build, I swapped out Four Leaf Clover for Serendipity and never went back.
---
Best of luck with your build! You seem to have a strong foundation for a gunslinger build.
---
Oh thanks for that! I haven't crafter any weapons yet, so I was unaware
---
Hey I dont appr
---
We‚Äôre only in it for that sweet, sweet defend workshop event XP and daily challenges /s
---
A love story as old as time itself
---
You can pick somwthing out of my vendor if you‚Äôd like just lmk
---
Will you be doing this tomorrow?
---
Forgive me I haven't done any research on this yet but what is the reason for needing legendary perks?  Will they be adding new end game creatures?   Making the existing game harder?   Right now I'm at level 181 and I own the game.  Unless I'm careless I never die and killing 95% of creatures is done with one shot.  Who needs legendary perks to actually do something or make the game easier?
---
The  Ammo Converter 
---
 "We hope these adjustments will help those of you with lots of ammo in storage to swap it more effectively once our next update arrives. "
---
What Storage? Who can afford to store that much Ammo?
---
Having the same issue aswell, have tried all of "fixes" to no avail. I'm  in the US, tried different regions via vpn, nothing changes. Hope for a fix soon.
---
The problem is the event just tells you to collect it. That‚Äôs all you have to do the first time so people think that‚Äôs all you have to do for the last part as well. One person can easily keep it up though. Also the prompt to add it to the fire is wonky af and you have to be right on top of the fire looking at the right angle.
---
Then move your camp. It's obviously in a high trafficked area.
---
I totally agree but I think a system like that would be hard to implement. I think the issues it server hoping is broken because it put you in the same server 99% of the time. 
---
If you have F1st leave the world the go to your private server and then back to public. This helps me to not get thrown back into the same servers
---
Only three?  Gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers in this racket.
---
I take it back. Being in power armor should count for something. 
---
It's a hallmark of fallout and it means nothing. I this a cute way to avoid fall damage.
---
What the hell Bethesda? 
---
I'm shrouded in steel and dying as though I had nothing on. Why put that armor in there at all?
---
No probably not. Does your game lag much? Just curious, because mine lags a little in 2 or 3 areas in 1080p.
---
I agree those screams were super creepy. But my first trip into fort defiance was even worse. You could hear heavy breathing right behind you on every floor, or the shuffling of feet. Turns out that's on 2and and 3rd floor, wth?
---
I'm on xbox so it's not really something I've come across or look for lol
---
Same here. Exactly my thoughts. The more feedback we provide, the more obvious it is that not only they do not really care, but they're simply incapable of making things right at this point.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I guess what happened is parts of the team got fired after each major fuck up and new people came to take their place. New guys didn't even had time to get to know the game's insides to be able to properly fix it, which led to yet another fuck up and they got fired as well. And that went on and on and on.
---
I'm partial to the Commander's storyline as well. It is great, and everyone is well done. Even that asshat Emmerson. I mean, fuck that guy but his VA is great.
---
What's weird is how the tone clashes with the rest of the game. Here's a recording of a girl being brutally attacked by something, and here I am dressed like a clown (literally) killing giant roaches with a rolling pin. I get that story has never been 76's strong point, but geez is the narrative jarring at times.
---
Yeah same here dude
---
Rose is a horrible robot.  Total whack-job monster.  One of the best characters in 76 because of that deeply developed character though.  So yes, she totally pranked you.
---
Do you only need one tent to pull this off?
---
They drop from high level enemies. SBQ, super mutants. I think that I have got the most in cranberry bog. 
---
You can also build some yourself to scrap. 
---
But you need science expert or science master level 2 to build them. 
---
You are on Xbox right? If so. I can mod it for you for free. And if you don‚Äôt have the plan I got a spare you can have.
---
I will be on later today. 
---
 
---
GT: Snogen.
---
This seems like a high caliber over reaction. They are cosmetic items, and you can get through most of the track without doing the NW challenges. I get downvoted every time I say this; but it's really not *that* bad. Hell, you can hide in the water, or bushes, the ghillie suit ensure people will even bump into you and not notice. The kill creatures is annoying  definitely but the pick locks, gain xp, survive for a half hour, those are simple and don't even require you to interact with anyone if you're slick about it.
---
They are NOT forcing you to do anything.
---
You can get 6 outta 7 every day w/o PvP.
---
The only disgusting thing here, is you trying to force Bethesda to change the game how YOU want.  Tons of people want more NW SCORE.
---
They‚Äôre adding extra mod slots as a legendary perk :D
---
Add a back pack mod to it and I‚Äôd actually use but I‚Äôm rocking a 450 carry weight why would I use my strangler heart power armor
---
No duper‚Äôs on console?
---
Now.. Let's try again using english.
---
Same here, but it also micro-stutters every now and then. And yeah, I'm playing on 2560*1600 resolution.
---
You mean Todd
---
In this situation it's ... The right church, wrong pew.... Pew..
---
Thats crazy, but i get it. Its a lot of displayed small items with a lot of detail that probably put some stress on servers on par with the kind of stress a camp full turrets does so having them take take a lot if budget makes sense. Although i do think Bethesda should be looking for ways to make it better. I think instanced interiors for CAMPs coming later this year will help that problem for a lot of players that like to set up a ton of displayed items. Im hoping the budgets are independent of each other so i can keep the outside looking wild sans displays and the make a nice interior with all my budget heavy displayed items like mags and bobbleheads.
---
&gt;some things hold true across the field.
---
Yup. For instance, I am 100% certain that Bethesda does not do any unit testing whatsoever of any of their code.
---
What the hell? Now I regret buying it...
---
It just works!
---
Yeah, I'm actually kind of excited to try it. I'll give it another day and hope for the best, all we can do with Bethesda, sadly.
---
uhh there are plenty of other ways to earn score. no one's forcing you to do shit
---
the FOMO is strong with this one
---
I wonder if anyone in the Wasteland even knows or remembers what Disney is/was actually.
---
Fix... what is this... fix... that you speak of?
---
I personally wish mine would show threw haha. Think it looks kinda bad ass
---
The raspy voice makes me think Blanche Devereaux is it under that mask..... That's a gilf under those rags...
---
Wait when are the legendary perk cards going live [xbox1] I just logged on and don't see anything that has to do with legendary perk cards anywhere
---
Quit the game and close it completely.  Then reload the game.  My character selection disappears after I've played for a while.  Shutting the game down completely works for me.
---
Thats a place I feel needs a buff. It‚Äôs a damn water park!
---
Oh yeah, that was hella dark. Got worse the more you looked into her notes too
---
Do we get a walkthrough soon?!
---
Most certainly tomorrow. Thank you for your interest!
---
Oh gods, yes. Every time I hit a bug that is 100% repeatable when just executing the basic function of something, it makes me twitch.
---
There are
---
"Demotivating" should just be the tagline for FO76.
---
So... Question.  Is it then better to assume Bethesda doesn't intend for any one character to actually grind this out?  Basically the intent is to maybe max out 1 legendary perk per character but if you're Insane there is still a grind for you?
---
I guess I've never quite understood why that if something is in a game then it must be reasonably obtainable for absolutely everyone.  To me it doesn't.  The intent here seems to me that leveling a legendary perk should be extraordinary and it's not intended for someone to max out more than one or two.  But it still rewards anyone for going that extra 1000 miles.
---
If this is the intent then these perks should be strengthened imo and it shouldn't cost you points to respect.
---
&gt;Plus its kinda hard trying to manage so many items with so many players.
---
Yeah, if you're incompetent like Bethesda it is. There are plenty of games with way more players and way more items. The crux of the issue is that Bethesda has mismanaged this game from day one.
---
I recently got banned on july 6 and I honestly have no clue what I did it says for cheating I did try godmode and wasnt successful but idk
---
Tell me about it... They made it by a standard scheme like they used to: Release a very buggy game and let the modders fix it. It worked in the past, right? But hey, I guess they forgot the most important part: they postponed full mod support and it's not even on the horizon yet within two years after launch as far as we can see now...
---

I'd bookmark this page - it has proven very helpful to me in the past.
---
I'm level 186 and I have 20 characters.  I only pay with 3, the other 17 are mules loaded down with stuff.
---
Pendleton at Studio 58 in the Whitespring has all your housing needs!
---
&gt; the original Gamebryo engine did not support multiplayer. 
---
wat
---
The first game to use it was MMO Dark Age of Camelot.
---
Don‚Äôt crucify me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôve done this at my camp and thought this was purchasable at the responder bots
---
I kind of hope they get to the point that they lock down all the dupes, and then wipe everyone's account and get us started back to square one. It would suck, sure, but it's really the only way to definitively get rid of all the duped items.
---
I like it but I just  wish was easier to get atoms :(
---
&gt; And let's not forget that great meme where they released an update that was built upon the wrong version of the game so it reverted the update before it
---
Damn.  I totally forgot about this.  That was so unbelievable to me at the time I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it.  Then the community just found proof over and over again that the previous update was just gone.  I believe the PA bug was back with a vengeance too.
---
It looks like a Xmas tree...
---
I do this at level 45 lol. Drop stimpaks, plans, and ammo all the time.
---
Haven't ran into them but also not looking for them
---
&gt; rng in this game is not fun (in my opinion).
---
Try getting the Fixer plan. It's a never-ending deluge of disappointment.
---
I'm with you, the pvp is trash in this game. Don't let any yes men trying to stand up for Bethesda's crappy game design tell you otherwise. Some parts of this game are great. NW is by far the worst pvp experience ever, and I played EA's first battlefront so that's saying a lot.
---
I've seen 600s two or three times, and I think a 900s once.
---
Yeah, that's a good idea - instead of them informing us we should all individually ask for information. I'm sure Todd will answer each email personally.
---
I‚Äôve scoured the train stations, I‚Äôll have to check the separate Responder bots
---
Drops just about everywhere, look for the bosses in each area and they can be found in locked safes/boxes. There is no plan for it.
---
Thanks for your detailed response. 
---
I could def see not always running gunsmith.  So a few points there rusty can go other places. 
---
I'm worried that getting rid of ironclad  hurts my defenses a bit too much. Vaccinated is my personal qol. I hate diseases . Haha. 
---
As for the STR, currently my mutations would be giving me -7 total, so even with 4 uny pieces, it ends up at 5, giving me 25 carry weight.  So I'd be sacrificing 15 carry weight for blocker. That seems reasonable. I could also easily give up EGG Head and add another 3 str, which gives me the other 15 carry weight. 
---
As for taking out 4LC. That seems to make more sense than better crits. 
---
Again. Thanks so much.
---
At the moment I don't think there is. Reminds me of a hilarious story someone posted on this subreddit about how they installed an NSFW mod that changed the artwork in his camp and didn't realise that it changed all the artwork across the entire wasteland. Still tickles me to this day
---
I have all 3 but won't be on until tomorrow. Let me know if you haven't found them by then.
---
I‚Äôll need to recheck him, it‚Äôs very possible I‚Äôve overlooked something. Thanks!
---
You have to be careful because some of them may try to send in footage to report you with. They just cut out the initial instigation. Then they post it on youtube to spread how bad the game is. Dont ask why they do it. They just dont have anything else better to do I guess.
---
There are people still playing Everquest 20+ years later.  You can do it man, you can do it!
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
Haha
---
Legendary modules are used to craft the new gauss-style weapons or other Wastelanders armor. 
---
The last time I checked it takes two legendary modules (LMs) to craft a gauss shotgun (the weapon you mentioned). 
---
So if the modules were on same then (37.5 scrip/LM)x(2 LM/shotgun) =  75 scrip/shotgun. So you now spent 75 scrip to get one legendary gauss shotgun. And, by the way, it‚Äôs not guaranteed to be a 3 star legendary when you craft it. 
---
Assuming your luck got you a 3 star legendary shotgun then you could sell it to the purveyor for 40 scrip. 
---
You‚Äôve now lost (75 scrip spent - 40 scrip gained )= 35 scrip. 
---
I think even Moleminers don‚Äôt like that math.
---
Oh yeah. I wouldnt say incompetent, but they are single player rpg devs. They have no clue how to do any MOBA stuff.
---
? Daily Challenges, NW is required.
---
you mean these guys hiding in bushes?
---
if i have to say a number, i would call it 80% of hiding cowards who don't even loot or try to kill me, even if i stand right in front of them doing emotes while we're the last two survivors. also the afk jump-bots behind the Highschool is ridiculous, i killed 6 stacked players in one lobby today. i would assume that this guys don't really want to play the mode, but they do it for Score and the bugged out challanges.
---
I think they want all the players to use unyielding-herbivore-int stacking builds with magic LMG's or sneak rifle to power grind everything 24/7... what happened to this game?? At this point people aren't going to grind and just wait for the next XP glitch to pop and abuse it.
---
On top of what has already been said...
---
The fact that "we don't want people to miss their pretty cards!" is part of their thought process is annoying. How many people care about animated cards? Them bring worth more for coins was literally the only use I've ever had for them.
---
This season.

*Pity...I mean perfect, so good to see you again Leslie.*

Use some ranged weapons. Even if your build is solely melee, the enemies are a low enough level that a stiff breeze will blow them over.
---
It's a super easy event that can be completed extremely quickly.
---
Game's economy is a joke, BiS gear have been duped since day 1. But let me put this straight: if it wasn't for dupers, most of us would never get any good pieces of gear at all. I literally dropped two god-rolled items throughout my 1800h+ of gameplay since beta. 98% of the rest I got from friends for free, never bought/traded for god-rolls ever. And I must admit, I got a fair share of fun playing with all that stuff. I don't think I would without it, but I'm glad I could put my hands on the best gear in the game without the need to put enormous efforts into getting it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really awkward just hearing her scream bloody murder and everyone just standing around cringing
---
Because they have to... because being displayed in your camp doesn't magically exclude all of them from still needing to be loaded every time you open your stash.
---
Exactly! Especially now since its summer!
---
It‚Äôs called the Daisy Rug or Rug/Rug2 usually you can get it from Defend Workshop events (I‚Äôve gotten many that way and drop em.)
---
I didn't expect anyone to agree and my comment to be down voted to oblivion, I'm glad one person has a similar view of PVP in this game.
---
it‚Äôs so unenjoyable now üòû i‚Äôm only level 70 and haven‚Äôt finished a lot of main quests and it still added this layer of pressure that ruined the game
---
So I quickly logged on before, and moved the CAMP, and the spawn point did move more to the "front" of my allotment, but still not exactly where I wanted.  I think its also true about some who say its on the northern  areas of your allotment.
---
What us wrong with rolling? You don't need the best possible weapon on the first go. People want the best shit  immediately. You don't always have to be meta
---
server-hopping tangra town 4 times will give you the same amount within 5min's. about 50 acid each server, 1min to get up and kill everything once you are routinized.
---
Its just me, or most of those salty encounter  stories comming from console players only? Or maybe that's because they have some kind of text chat without mods
---
Dat ass do
---
They probably looked that some players are around 1500 and figured this is intended to be the long term goal to chase even for high level players, then calibrated the costs so the people who've played for the year or so would have one maxed card. This would give them what, five years of "content" to grind?
---
I don't think the intent is people having maxed cards for a long time, but various combinations of unmaxed ones. That said, as a level 150 or so playing casually since release, this content apparently isn't for me.
---
idk what it causes, but be happy - my whole camp got deleted and acted like i never placed one for weeks.
---
Christ, you're 600 levels ahead of someone just starting now and you're whining like a little bitch you aren't getting enough free shit out of this.
---
This system is intended to still be relevant 2 years from now and there are already people in the game that can max out their cards on day 1.
---
&gt;The only disgusting thing here, is you trying to force Bethesda to change the game how YOU want.
---
Where did I say that, I just don't want to be forced into NW, I don't care what you want to to do.
---
I rather do it than Tea Time or Feed The People. In those it's just standing around for 5+ minutes one-shotting bugs and ghouls.
---
By all means, it isn't the best event but atleast you sorta control how long it lasts.
---
You are correct. In fact, a significant number of games developed w/it had some form of multiplayer component. Bethesda did several interviews talking about needing to build in multiplayer from scratch and all of the associated challenges due to the engine design, and I assumed those problems were inherited from the original. That's my bad for not doing sufficient research. Instead, they apparently stripped it out and did weird things to the world processing when they forked Gamebryo to make their own engine because... reasons?
---
for real everything is capped and super annoying. sitting on 80 treasury notes, sitting on a shit load of legendaries to fill up the remaining space in stash. yes bethesda we get you want us on every day, used to be for fun now just a chore. sad to see this from my favorite franchise
---
welcome to Failout76, you should get used to this kind of bugs. on the bright side: you will laugh about which ridiculous bugs happen and how abstract the workarounds are.
---
just give me the damn thanksgiving display shelves back
---
&gt; two monks, a nun, and a giraffe.

sweet, this is my Rule 34 white whale

My family has spent hundreds on this broken game already. We got 2 Power Armor Editions, 1 for my brother and 1 for me, but we had to buy them for 2 different platforms to be able to get 2 copies of the PA edition (we love this series &amp; our favorite collectibles are in-unicerse items whether Star Wars or Fallout or something else). Thus another $30 or so to pick up another copy so my brother &amp; I could actually play together since there's no cross platform capabilities. On top of that, because he only has a PS4 &amp; that's the platform we play on, we both got subscriptions for PS+ specifically for this game.
---
Plus, it's not just two bucks because I'm pretty sure you can't buy just 200 atoms. I was under the impression it's 5 or above which sure, it's only 5 more bucks. But on top of hating mtx on a *good* day, I sure as hell don't want to spend money like that on a game that thought a terminal for the ammo converter was a good idea or that QOL improvements like the scrap box were worth more than my Netflix and Spotify+Hulu subscriptions, almost combined.
---
So I'm good on spending any more money on this. They got enough of it already.
---
I can't stop thinking about her feeeeet AAAAAHHHH
---
I expect them to fight back if not then I call them out and if they dont wanna pvp well fuck it move on lol
---
Well, some people did care, but that's not the point really. It's inconsistency in their design decisions that matters here.
---
They already made a step to understanding, that people might not even want to scrap their cards at all. It annoys me to no end how they still refuse to understand that perk loadouts should be released first and there won't be any need in scrapping excess cards.
---
Doing that for potential profit (of getting some buffs, that are mediocre at best and not really game-changing at all) is even worse decision, since it leads to us getting stuck with one build per character at this pace.
---
This
---
If you don‚Äôt have one yet, your best bet is to find one at a player vendor, I found one for 4k. Then I got another from encryptid after like 30 times and sold it for 10k
---
Lots of posts from people looking for European servers and small huddle's at obscure train stations, but nothing widespread through the general economy that I've noticed.
---
I have only so far claimed the sink which is useful for crafting I just like to complete daily challenges from a completionist's perspective, my FOMO is from missing out completing that aspect, I'm not interested in the rewards.
---
welcome to Failout76, glade you finaly encountered your fist issue.
---
keep on playing, you will be excited which ridiculous bugs occur. As someone who plays still BeTA, the game already did a long way - this doesn't mean it is fine now, but hell it was broken for sure.
---
Over 100 rolls on Plasma Caster. Not a single Bloodied. That's what's wrong. 100 rolls for Secret Service chest. Plenty of threev star Zealot and Nocturnal. Only a few one star Unyielding. Didn't roll the Unyielding until I got rid of my rads, mutations, equipped gear, and perks. Game is rigged. Will give you Vanguard if specs for Bloodied. Bloodied if you're Vanguard.
---
Yes you absolutely can
---
That‚Äôll never work. On PC you can have...custom loading screens. As much as I love looking at specific deathclaws, I don‚Äôt think everyone else wants to see that at my camp.
---
explorer outfit with green hood and gas mask was my old favorite, now its gotta be the bog wanderer mask with imposter sheepsquatch outfit
---
I love it as well, its givin the game a whole new life for me and the groups did as well. It seems that the main issue people have is the decrease in Atoms, but if you think it about the items you're getting would have cost Atoms as well. My main goal is at least 88 for the Cosmos Power Armor Skin that would have normally cost what 1500-1800 now I'll get it for free by putting in some grind that i was already doing for the 10-20 atoms the dailies used to give.
---
And Hancocks outfit would be cool.
---
To be fair the weapons that kill the queen or known as magic weapons. They still drop. It's just a series of broken perks. Check out the YouTube video from angry turtle about them
---
My main is lvl 241 now, and I didn't really have proper end-game gear until level 130 or so, and it wasn't until 200 that I had a really well-tuned loadout.  There's always something else to optimize in your character.
---
They're all 9ver the forbidden sub haha
---
How is it required? You could easily just earn an extra 30,000 xp to cover the loss.
---
search ps4 data cache, rebuilding it helped with a lot of my issues. Also just deleted a few older games and lot of older files, (i pretend that helped)
---
This system is intended to still be relevant 2 years down the road.  This is an MMO folks, not a single player game.  If everything was handed to you, everyone would quite after 40 hours and the servers would long ago have been shut down.
---
As there are already people in the game with enough levels to max out their cards on day 1... this system ISN'T TOUGH ENOUGH.
---
Sorry super casuals, you aren't entitled to get everything maxed out.  I know in your generation everyone got a trophy, but too bad.
---
I literally got a AAE Gatling Plasma last week. Took me three weeks for someone to respond and trade. I had to trade literally all of my inventory. It‚Äôs mind blowing how people are getting these kinds of weapons so easily
---
Mole miner smooth talk got me actin up...
---
Don't forget the scrapbox which is something that should just be in the base game as a QOL improvement. Honestly FO1st, if it even needs to exist (which it doesn't) should be about letting players get early access to updates like a headstart on the Legendary Run which also gives them more of a buffer while grinding through it, &amp; other things that are cool but *not* arguably essential tweaks to gameplay. Those tents ARE convenient but they're not an absolute must imo. Your camp and the ability to move it gives you the same ability at a literal cap cost and the cost of having to remake everything if you have a bigger camp like I do.
---
Bit the scrapbox seems 100% essential to not going insane over micromanaging even the bare necessities in addition to all the *currencies.*
---
I am lvl 121 and no mater what, I would like to be friends, and help out anyone that I can. I will never become a toxic person toward lower level players. :)
---
Maybe Bethesda decreased spawns due to the Inoculation being created and players obliterating them. It would make sense and it's small but a cool addition if it's an addition at all.
---
If you visit player vending machines you will find them, anything from around 300-500 caps. At least on PC there is usually on player selling serum.
---
I‚Äôve actually managed to get some pretty good rewards like the fancy pump action shotgun and the fancy revolver. I tend to find a ton of claim tickets mowing down scorched and ghouls
---
my sleeping [tenno](http://warframe.com), let me guide you to a world made for people like us. like *you*.
---
I've done the event twice (I've recently started playing the game again and didn't realize that was a quest), and got the backpack plan on the second run, so keep your fingers crossed.
---
Bethesda clearly doesn't understand what gets players returning to a game. Yes, if you timelock everything people will return (mobile games are famous for this), but they will do so begrudgingly. Conversely, if you let players earn stuff at their own pace, they will return on their own grounds.
---
GTA online is a great example of letting players grind however they see fit. They don't limit currency to $1,000,000 a day just to get repeat business.
---
Nobody likes feeling like the game's holding out on them, and will leave because of it.
---
The game has to load the server itself before loading player-made things. Including every player, workshops, and you guessed it, camps.
---
or the new t65
---
You know if you're a cop you have to, like, legally tell me.
---
I have been searching for my issues for DAYS and this was it!  Thank you so much!
---
I was having a horrible time this morning, lagging then finally crashes every time I tried to log on on the opening screen.  Got so frustrated, out of desperation I deleted the whole game from my PS4 and reloaded it - took 3 hours to download.
---
I really don't want to jinx it, so knock on wood, but afterwards.... this game has never run so well.  Practically no lag, smooth gameplay... even my gauss rifle was sort of behaving in VATs.  It's terrifying that I may lose this quality experience again.  It has been so nice today.
---
wear a marine armor, then enter the PA. the pip-boy don't show it as equiped, but you are much more bulletproof and the marine armor gets damaged inside a PA, which proofs that the stats are applied.
---
Those are best for melee builds. I don't think they're best for gun builds
---
Ok thanks for the tip, i will have a look at it tonight.  I assume the servers have been ok for you over the last 12-18 hours?
---
I thought to complete the Gold Star you need to complete all the challenges including these NW ones?
---
I'll just chug down more cranberry relish.
---
Can someone explain to me why I need to be 1500?
---
I am level 5. Installed the game today. So you say I must just uninstall it and pretend it never existed?
---
What do you mean by "dead eyes"?
---
Servers will close in 2 years.
---
it is a glitch, and as such it isn't recommended.
---
I was gonna say I‚Äôd honestly probably even prefer a yellow light to the green. Why did they make the flashlight green in this one when the hud is like yellow/orange?
---
Great thats what i wanted to know.  Was wondering if the duping had caused issues like in the past.  Thanks for your response :)
---
Happened to me the other night and a friend was watching asked me what happened. Told her my character is clumsy and stubbs his toes all the time.. Lol
---
Can‚Äôt do mine today. Oh no
---
Bethesda really needs to ease up on caps for bullion and scrip. Maybe have a double scrip or double bullion event each weekend so we can get a boost in our amount. 
---
I'm sitting on 180+ notes and trash legendary weapons just sit in my inventory just so I can scrip them to get more trash legendaries just so I maybe get the chance of getting a good weapon to maybe sell for about 2000 caps. I don't know why I play this game anymore lol.
---
I was going through my stuff and noticed I had 47 claim tickets which I didn't know what they were for.   After learning where to use them I turned them in and on the first one got a 3* .44 snubnose.   I thought, cool, this is going to be fun.  The remaining 46 were crap like you got.
---
F-76 crashes on my PC, on average, once every 20 minutes.   I‚Äôm unable to launch a nuke, since I can‚Äôt complete a silo run.
---
I‚Äôve replaced my PC, still does it.  Other games work fine.  Reported the problem and did all the suggested fixes, still happens.  Searched the Internet and tried all the fixes I found there.  No luck.  
---
I love the game, but it is like being in an abusive relationship.  Every time it happens I just whisper ‚Äú...why...?‚Äù
---
Some of you got the patience of Jesus and dedication of virgin Mary herself talkin bout deleting characters and making new ones.
---
I know how one generally goes about finding things to buy, I just haven't had any luck in the last couple days. Sometimes it's easier to just ask instead if server hopping endlessly.
---
Inspiration, tenderizer, squad maneuvers(if no one is running speed demon, bodyguards, suppressor, strange in numbers.
---
Herd mentality serum is useful as a replacement for lone wanderer for yourself since you can use it even when alone in a public group.
---
I'm a Melee build maybe I should carry a rifle for this reason lol
---
Its all fun and games, but 9 of 10 times some fuker shows at event and just kill the horde boss.
---
I've got 1800 hours in since launch and I'm level 260
---
My endgame is dropping nukes on terrible locations and watching people wander around trying to figure out why some idiot dropped a nuke there.
---
meg/Paige are still bitchy if you choose the opposite fraction in the last mission, even if you get to maximum reputation.
---
That's happened to me before a couple times and I have no idea what causes it. It even once carried over outside of the map into normal gameplay whenever I would look in a certain direction.
---
There‚Äôs also the purveyor scrip
---
I like to not being forced into anything and being able to take my time for everything.
---
Its fun to aimlessly roaming appalachia or taking care of my camp. RN i mostly playing a cpt cosmos board game I found.
---
Isn‚Äôt recommended sure but it gets the job done, makes a use for those god rolls that would probably be tossed out because your never gonna use them
---
Wow good explanation! It does feel kinda weird tho, since i think it should decrease only max health when well fed runs out, instead of decreasing both max health and actual hp.
---
Commikazie, if you will.
---
treasure maps have a chance to drop them.
---
you can get 1 star legendary versions of them from the watoga high school candy machine also.
---
they drop in steamer trunk things and sometimes on big enemies like the grafton monster i think.
---
no plan for them exists
---
If you want an easy way to get screws travel to abbie's bunker in the mire and go down the road till you find the truck hanging from a tree, you alway have 1 to 3 wendigo chilling in the trees and they drop screws fiberglass and assorted gear.
---
I figured :P
---
I have an exp. Pipe Rifle that I use. It's got great acc., and no one uses their .38 ammo.
---
Those stories are awesome
---
I think it‚Äôs time to delete reddit
---
Totally agree with you. Just wanna add that some of the game mechanics/rewards pool are completely broken, the most irritating is being a highish level player/leveling up means nothing. ‚ÄòWe all hate dupers, until we find one with the item we grinded for months/years...‚Äô i  have done encrypted 3 times today, haven‚Äôt had a single item worth taking(not a single 3star item awarded...), and i was a good team player, pylon, fight, revived others and only died once in one of the tries. So the ‚Äòrewards‚Äô were 3white fedoras, 1 ‚Äòrare‚Äô outfit, 5 1* weapons and 1 2* weapons, at level 154. What is the point doing the event??? Lost about 45 stims and a 1000 bullets...  you talked about the purveyor(the chances for a buttf‚Äôing, it meant to be a lottery, although higher level should mean something...)but having the same stash/scrip/caps/camp/gold/‚Äòisthereanythingnotlimited ‚Äòetc limit is an absolute joke(i am guessing i am not the only one who keep dropping most 1-2star items as i have no room). You should be playing the game so you have a chance to earn appropriate, level based rewards, but you are not getting awarded for hard events or the hours you put into the game and you can‚Äôt even keep half the staff you ‚Äòfought for‚Äô because you won‚Äôt be able to store it or sell it or scrip it thanks to the f‚Äôin limits (i have enough scrip on my mule for about 2-3 weeks...)Also, probably the most common complain, a ‚Äòregular, let‚Äôs go hunting/have fun‚Äô sort of gameplay where you find a random 3* legendary enemy almost every good location, but you still get a 1* bs drop (it happens to friends over level 700...). Either get 3* enemies more rare,and have it drop min 2* , or loose star dependency, call them ‚Äòlegendary enemy‚Äô so we have a chance to get any 1-3 star legendary items from any legendary enemy. It still be cocked up(we talk about a bethesda game) but at least we(i) don‚Äôt want to slam the controller through the tv when a 3* high level asaultron dominator that came out of nowhere drops a 1* pipe... So for all of these, i understand why people looking for glitches. And if bethesda would value players more, and creat a more fair, less annoying and limited experience, people would actually play the game rather than look for glitches... I haven‚Äôt duped today, but if someone offering for a resonable price, i am happy to pay... now i am gonna get downvoted üòÇ
---
A core that powered a fusion reactor for 11 years can't move the armor for more than 10 minutes.  Meh.  The whole core system is dumb.
---
This is wrong and people need to stop claiming this.
---
The XP curve has been adjusted in a previous patch and it's now a linear growth, all the way up to level "who even knows".
---
You need 200 XP to get to level 2. After that it's 160 XP more for each level. So to get to level 1500, assuming you start a new character, you need 179,939.960 XP. That's right, 180 million XP.
---
To verify this, use this formula
---
XPn=160\*(n‚àí1)+200
---
n = next level
---
So for level 1500
---
XP1500 = 160 \* (1500 - 1) + 200
---
That's 240,040 XP to get from level 1499 to 1500 alone.
---
Server hop a few times whilst checking the vendor strip in The Whitesprings Resort. You'll pretty commonly find 3 for sale from different vendors on the same world.
---
There's no plan.
---
Stranger in numbers is my favorite to have shared with me and what I always share with others
---
I've got speed demon for sale in one of my vendors. Hit me up GT: DeGuy12
---
Ooh I made her too, but idk how to share images on here, you did a good job
---
I‚Äôve had this twice too.  Only way I could fix it was by manually selecting another weapon in my Pip-Boy.
---
Compared to Legendary Armor, all Power Armors are underpowered. adding legendary Effects will make them Equal for sure, also there are  [hacked legendary power armors](https://i.imgur.com/RQUdEoO.png) out for months.
---
Adding them officially would a) weak the 3rd party sellers, b) make PA's more worthy then just a need to wear for stabilized perk card and c) make them equal and tanky as they should be.
---
same. just gotta wait for beth to fix. a lot of people having this issue atm.
---
That's not what was said, at all. No one is complaining that there is a grind, but that the grind has to be halted by minimal caps like 200 bullion per day and 150 scrip. 
---
Bethesda can ease off and it still be a rewarding grind. Bethesda needs to realize that people don't NEED to play this game 24/7 to achieve maximum progress. It's a chore at that point. 
---
It's also related to how the Legendary run isn't really long enough to complete unless you play every day and do every challenge. 
---
It's become a regular routine for alot of people. It's the definition of a chore. We don't want to do it, but if we don't we'll be stuck behind those who did it every day.
---
I want to work for bethesda right now! Within 6 months, I'd have cleaned out 70% of the most annoying bugs. Fixed the auto complete or backtrack on legendary run. Crushed the dupes and dupers. Cut the grind on legendary perk cards by 45%. Introduce new and more intense end game Boss fights, where team play is the best strategy. Add more cosmetics and build designs every week and start an actual rotation on the ATOM shop. Release more variations of power armor models and power armor specific weapons and attachments(shields, disease resistances and such). Design and implement new turrets and traps for C.A.M.Ps. Increase the maximum capacity for for gold bullion, script, and caps. Slightly increase the roll rates in purveyor. 
---
             That's all just to start
---
had more to do with getting people too log in every day. beth could give a fuck less about the dupes. they want people to log in everyday, thats why they are behind the bullion timewall and are bound.
---
people keep making the connection to dupes, but its just because its topical from time to time. the bullion system was planned to be this way long, long ago.
---
there could never have been a dupe in the game ever, and they still would have made it this way. daily user logins is the king metric, and thats all that matters to them.
---
Its either the assaultron, or sentry bot helmet. I think both of them need an assaultron circuit board to make. I honestly didn't even realize it would include a paint for the helmet, thats sick!
---
Preach

The two aren't mutually exclusive.. one reason doesn't negate the other, and assuming so is just naive.
---
I also get many, but RS is my go to. Seems silly to dupe a (relatively) easy to farm plan
---
2 perk coins only 3 installments of $59.99
---
Or 14000 atoms
---
why would you ever dupe super stims and not just regulars? seems really dumb to me.
---
Definitely in mounted plans, plasma mines, plasma grenades.
---
Ah the good nurse! üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
---
I'm not sure. It does seem so - I have noticed I can go some places and not get bothered, whereas before I'd very likely land up in a fight with one. And it is definitely easier going to the glass cavern these days. There are still scorchbeasts around though, and if I hung around the areas long enough I'm sure I'd see them. 
---
Something has been altered I think, maybe not removing some of them, more like just giving us a bit more space rather than having one descend on us just as we get to an area.
---
The claim tickets haven't existed for more than a year...
---
Oh you mean like it glitched and blocked us for each other by itself? That's possible. Was just googling ways to unblock people the only way is to have a 3rd player invite us both :( We are on PS4.
---
It says you're offline...
---
Role play and run vending machines for low levels.  4 characters with unique backstory.
---
I have my preferences set, what's your GT?
---
I like to share cannibal cuz it binds the jump button to eating corpses that you're examining 
---
Leads to a lot of surprises and hilarity ensues
---
Just logged in for a few dailies, nothing noticeable besides normal crafting lag
---
The Gauss Shotgun and Minigun is best in their respective classes, and the USSS Armor and T-65 offer the best resistances. However, I only use the Gauss Minigun for tank/boss enemies
---
TheCrimsonDon
---
I've always taken some amount of Explosive dmg from the Gauss minigun at close range. Not sure about the Pistol or shotgun, but I would assume them to be the same.
---
lmao this market has been fucked since December. lol at these posts everytime there is a dupe and people freakout looking for a new currency... that will then get duped.
---
this is why you dont put strangle limits on your main server side currency.
---
I have a jffr and vffr gauss mini gun. I never use them. I much prefer my other guns. The ammo is to heavy, they take up half your screen, and they're good but not worth it imo.
---
Many bugs have been coming back with a vengeance since launch. The only reason we haven't been seeing much of that recently is because they've been releasing one update every 5-10 weeks since Q3 2019. Less opportunities to break things if you don't change anything for a month and a half
---
It just makes me sad though. If anything, it screams that they don't have the time/people/resources to properly do anything or double check things. The game had great potential, but if they're cutting the already low budget the game was getting, it's unlikely to ever recover
---
(pass zorbo)... (zorbo shoots your ship, back to beginning)
---
[edit: /s]
---
There are pistol builds that can 1 shot supermutants and take down SBQ relatively fast. The newest guass pistol is pretty op if you build toward pistols.
---
Don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not viable when it is. There are tons of guides for pistol builds on youtube.
---
It is slow, it's taken me until now but I've finally got an almost perfect set of solar, with a secret service chest for when I'm playing solo, and a second one that's just for a jetpack
---
I guess if I just accept that the bullion items are a long term goal it doesn't hurt as much
---
Yeah what do I know huh? You keep on being you buddy I've said my part, have a good one.
---
I spend my time in search of somebody who like roleplays in this games. But sometimes I just act like NPC and wondering around speaking random quotes to everyone. Still doesn‚Äôt find anybody.
---
no, just no. 
---
the only people that get burned by duping are RMT monglords, greedy traders and people who think that they are invalidated by someone else having more shiny things than them.
---
New leg perk grants R3 hack/pick
---
So... Whenever that releases
---
\*professor voice\* Good news, everyone!
---
But really there's a legendary perk card coming that does that, and at higher ranks just auto picks/hacks everything for you.
---
"carrying a microscope? Thats a odd thing to do"
---
*Walks away*
---
The secret service chest is amazing just for the jetpack alone. And I‚Äôm having a blast with the OG plasma rifle.
---
Holy... Shit.
---
It's what the Overseer wanted
---
yeah, something like that. I love looking how people react after I said that.
---
Hundreds of hours into the game compared to a few hours into the game, yes they should totally be able to have all the god items they want because they're willing to cheat and break the terms of service, totally
---
And I'm not one of the people who has a bunch of legacies, I have a few decent weapons and a few armour sets, no legacies
---
My issue is that everything I own is now worth nothing to anyone because they can cheat and have god roll items, and I refuse to cheat
---
I have junkies 25/25 plasma caster and sadly I am not junkies build,but still keep this baby in case maybe in the future I will!
---
Heck yeah. I want to do things to earn Polly's favor. She's the first face you see when you walk in. Surely she knows things about stuff.
---
They absolutely do, as do most triple A companies 
---
Ubisoft does this very blatantly but usually they are at least transparent about the fact that they're just going off data rather than feedback 
---
Tbf tho, going off data and going off feedback both have their positives and negatives 
---
I would hardly call the fo76 or the general fallout fanbase "United" in 2hat they want. Everybody here wants something drastically different, that would most likely piss off everyone else lol
---
I think I know where this is going
---
people just want to blame shitty design on someone other than bethesda. 
---
bethesda doesnt sell in game weapons, they dont really care about duping because it doesnt effect their bottom line at all. they might ban a few from time to time (mostly RMT traders) but they dont care about the P2P economy.
---
noone has provided a shred of actual proof that the time gating and bound wastelanders equipment was because of duping. its just peoples knee jerk conclusion.
---
Player travels to your camp and leave a loot bag with a note "You have been insulted".
---
I got a bloodied I explosive Gatling plasma today and I‚Äôm legit high
---
I have experienced it. Usually it takes a little less than 5 minutes to load but instead its just seconds.
---
I recently got into the glory that is a strength build with a super sledge and power armor. Pop some buffout and psycho, and i become a train
---
Oh no, personally I moved from PS4 to pc, I have a ps4 pro and I consider this game a disgrace and unplayable on ps4. If you have patience and don't mind constant dropped frames it's still a fun and addictive game.
---
Hook a brotha up
---
Those are the new icons my guy
---
It‚Äôs more than likely there‚Äôs a few exploiters over 2k level and they are basing this off of them
---
I would uninstall if that were to happen
---
I thought legendary dragons are legacy now, isn't it? Didn't bethesda excluded them from legendary pool
---
As a side note, the location your map shows you at must be the "Zero Point" of the entire 76 map, (on the actual dimensions of the map, playable or not, this is the dead center of the map file on all axes) as it would make sense to default your location there. Interesting.
---
I wasn't aware of that, thanks for letting me know. Do you have any links where I can see them breaking this down or something? I'm having a difficult time hunting down something other than the wiki, which isn't sourced.
---
Nevertheless, the math being wrong in OP's title is probably the more prevalent issue in the thread dedicated to it.
---
They just need to make those cards 'passives' that are always active after you've unlocked them.
---
I‚Äôm not sure whether it‚Äôs laziness or efficiency, but it‚Äôs be more worth my time to switch cards than it would to be farm rare materials.
---
You should find him on recents and go do it again
---
Mine seem to come and go. I was still able to claim one if it didn‚Äôt show the icon on my map
---
Oh, and by the way, twas nice seeing you in game the other day! Unfortunately I got disconnected from the server three times in a row so I decided to leave the team for good -(
---
Get em!!
---
What level? If max level with FSS it's worth 10x that
---
Someone has never done Tea Time.
---
As long as one person is on the island you can bum rush the mirelurks
---
most people dont know that you can still get 1 star dragons and rippers from the candy machine RNG lol
---
2 star dragons are still legacy
---
No cuz guess what? Shit like that happens all the time.
---
When I was a kid? I'd *finally* get past that one Red Demon in Ghosts n Goblins. I'm about to pat myself on the back when guess what? The game froze up due to the game it's self or the old classic NES design (really read up on it the VCR design wasn't good for games) I'd be mad and wouldn't play it for a few days. Oh and by the way? That happened to a ton of NES games I played when I was a kid.
---
In the 1990's? A buddy of mine loaned me a copy of this game he had gotten on the PC called Fallout 2. Not only did I have the game crashing a ton? But Fallout 2 loved giving you corrupted saves. Oh and by the way? That was just Fallout 2, I had everything from Wing Commander, X-Wing/TIE Fighter, Doom and the wonderfully oh so stable house of cards known as Daggerfall.
---
Point I'm getting at? Crashes are going to happen thus you deal with them or find something else to do if it upsets you that much.
---
So many people on this sub never grew out of throwing tantrums to get what they want.  It would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad.
---
 - Having SCORE dailies connected to NW, "look how many people are playing the next big Battle Royale!1!!!1! "
---
Oh? most are hiding in bushes and disconnecting as soon as they've done their task? No worries, we got the daily NW players on our spreadsheet to show our overlords at Zenimax, quick lets call the shareholders and let them know this is the next Fortnite!
---
Every day, Atom starts further from Todd.
---
Fixed it. Even added the comma.
---
It doesn't work
---
Imagine this: an event, like powering up a nuke plant, but instead you get Willard‚Äôs in working order
---
This is fucking hilarious ahahaha
---
Ok let me start of by saying I am not defending anyone.
---
But sometimes to me it feels like the dupers almost(!) have a point. In some aspects the game is incredibly grindy and feels like some mechanics are to make it worse instead of better. So getting any good weapon takes hours upon hours upon hours to get even something decent. At some point I get being fed up with it and just taking the easier route.
---
Plus some dupers are actually really nice but maybe that's just my experience
---
Batteries Included helps. The main problem is that 2EC is hilariously expensive to craft. Normal 2EC isn't worth it at all. Ultracite 2EC is ok, I guess, but you'll need a constant supply of Crimson if you want to use them as everyday weapons.
---
Good boss fight weapons, not so much for everyday us.
---
Super obnoxious nuclear winter sucks I don't even want to play it at all and now I'm going to be forced to play it just for some dumb  Cosmetics I don't even want? There are a few things at the end of the season that are worth it but my God grinding through all these  rewards playing this mode I don't care about is stupid enough that I canceled fall out first after it just renewed for the second month.
---
Definitely want to punch fortnite in the face for bringing immense popularity to this system that essentially turns a fun game into a second job.
---
A business that listens to sales more than feels!?  
---
*Nowai!*
---
Hahaha
---
It‚Äôs all those radstag heads I swear. I mean come on guys, we‚Äôre looking for the brahmin heads. Gosh!
---
good for you. noone cares, its a you problem.
---
the value of items is what people will pay for them. there is still someone who will want the exact item you have, you just need to find them. if you are worried about what other people are doing especially when it doesn't directly impact you personally like something like a kill hack or inventory steal, then you need to reevaluate your priorities. 
---
stop measuring your epeen against other people dude, you will always lose. just carry on like you did before and ignore the dupe.
---
Play any event that spawns lots of bloodbugs (Tea Time and Campfire Tales are a couple of examples). Loot all the "bloodbug proboscis" from each corpse, and then scrap them all for acid. (You have to manually scrap, - it won't do it automatically).
---
That's been my method for getting acid, after all my fasnacht acid got used up.
---
I WOULD LOVE THAT!! 
---
But its bethesda, so it would take at least a year to make it happen.
---
Yeah I run it and still can't carry a ton of normal 2mm haha, well still have like 15k but it hurts me a lot lol. I just love my ult gat lasers to much
---
Makes sense with their track record. Only seen 1 person at level 800 and he did the xp glitch way back when. Level 1500 legit is surely impossible
---
My character (or our/the player character, if you want to get technical) is the only Mistress of Mystery, thank you very much. :P I don't mind NPCs arriving and being my Initiates and Novices, but I would genuinely be annoyed if some random character appeared, took over the faction/bunker and started treating my Scorched Ending, Currency Building, Cryptid Slaying, X-Men tier mutated, Mistress of Mystery like an underling.
---
I did sort of the same thing on my junkie raider character. I turned a "please no smoking" sign in to a "please go smoke" sign and put it on a cigarette machine.
---
I'm around 125-130. I stopped really paying attention after 100. Anyways, I try to unload extra plans and ammo to new players all the time, but I guess the waster skin on power armor is too intimidating. Dont run please, just take my stuff
---
I have BE25 dragon on one of my toon, looted it from some box at the train station in early 2019 lol.
---
Edit: do you remember which reward u need to choose to legendaries? Most expensive one?
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky, but I recently started playing again after trying the game during the free weekend. I‚Äôm almost level 30, but started back in at about a 21. Ive had nothing but good interactions with other players who just wanted to help me, and offered me free stuff. 
---
I was kind of freaking out when I picked a lock at someone‚Äôs camp and got a bounty on me. This guy happened to be there and killed me, and I was like ‚Äúsure no problem, I did something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to, and he got some caps.‚Äù But this guy then came to MY CAMP while I was repairing armor and started using emotes, then dropped like 100+ stimpacks, plans, food, and some giftboxes. And I was freaking out, because I was not expecting that. I unfortunately don‚Äôt have a mic so I couldn‚Äôt properly tell him thank you, but I offered him aluminum in return bc it was all I had of value haha. 
---
After that a level 70 something came over and saw us interacting and then started giving me stuff as well. 
---
That‚Äôs happened two other times since, by complete strangers who stopped me just to give me things. I kept thinking how lucky I got, but I realized that the wholesome part of this community seems pretty prevalent and it makes me want to keep playing. 
---
When I get better at the game and become a higher level I plan to return the favor to other new players. This game had a rough launch and still has its issues, but there‚Äôs still a lot of promise I think. So Bethesda better be glad they have people like this still in the community, keeping the game alive.
---
Came in new update as a feature, kinda sucks for new players that don‚Äôt know where the workshops are
---
To be fair would look a  bit daft an invisible guy with clothes on top kinda defeats the invisible bit as even a super mutant would probably think something is fishy about that floating t shirt and jeans over there XD
---
I would if shredded u
---
What is FSS
---
If the game is installed on a secondary drive (so not where Windows is) try going to Windows settings &gt; apps, find it in the list and click 'move'
---
I had the same "no region ping 1 5 1" error but once it had moved over to my C:/ drive, it worked
---
It's a mystery to me
---
It does directly impact me, as I just explained
---
I have to say your insistence that I'm comparing myself to others only brings your own self esteem into question
---
People are duping, breaking the terms of service for which they should be banned, and ruining the economy directly harming me and every single other person who has actually put time and effort into Fallout 76
---
Why would anyone want to buy a mixed vanguard wwr set for a reasonable price when they can go get a duped full heavy combat vanguard wwr set for nothing
---
Your entire argument and point of view are incredibly flawed, and obviously those of one abusing the glitch
---
Afraid not. I first noticed this when the SCORE system started as the 10K challenge makes it really obvious. I went thru Scorched Earth and Line in the Sand back to back, got the 10K popup 3 times but didn't level up once.
---
So I took the formula from the wiki, did a quick check for my level and here we are. Right now I can do 6 of those challenges without levelling up once.
---
In short, the formula on the wiki is correct, the curve flattening out, isn't. To check if there is a new flattening point we'd need the XP\_Curve.json and I think that's visible server side only.
---
What discount? Am i missing out on good items?
---
Photo Opportunity, Wayward edition. Take a photo of the Overseer's camp and Dutch's ass.
---
Faster swing speed
---
40% Faster swing speed as second effect.
---
I thought that at first, but then I jumped in and it seems as if they upped the spawn rate significantly. I hit 8 creatures my first game - would have been 9 but apparently someone wanted to kill me. Not cool.
---
Edit: I spawned at Bolton Greens - 6 creatures kills were from there in one game.
---
Well, it's max level with 50% limb damage.
---
clearly you are just emotional and need to take a break from the game if you are just going to insult people with a different perspective.
---
Nope, just a cheaper place to get alcohol, including a unique one that gives you +15 health
---
Western Outfits (a few, + with chaps) and a Fancy Pump Action Shotgun (3 star legendary). Handed in around 25 in total over the past month or so.
---
I would absolutely love to see the crazy pictures people take of me. I always wear funny outfits so I'm sure there's some out there.
---
Let the mirelurks reach the island, kill a lvl 20 mirelurk queen, event over.
---
Bravo.   Thanks for sharing.
---
You started the conversation with an insult
---
I didn't insult you until you insulted me again, and mine was much more mild
---
Saying I'm emotional and need to take a break because I insulted you doesn't work when you insulted me first, common sense
---
I miss scrapping beeswax for acid every single hour. Life was good those days!
---
It changes on Tuesdays
---
I have noticed some enemies that aren't killable this week. They are frozen in place and you cannot damage them
---
LOVE THIS.
---
Ah, that's too bad, hopefully, it's fixed sometime this week.
---
No it doesnt effect you. you just put too much stock in the player to player economy which has been though dozens of dupes. nothing about this is new, and nothing about today will really change anything. people will still need that armor set, the market just needs to calm down after the dupe get patched.
---
however, its NOT ok for you to just start accusing people of being dupers just because they wont commiserate with you.
---
You on Xbox perhaps? I've been searching for a good DCG for a while. Fed76 has it's value at 3-7k I'll give you 5k.
---
I have had that as well a few times.  There health goes down to nearly nothing but they wont die
---
It can make 2mm.  Its under energy ammo
---
It never was so you need 1500 levels to upgrade one perk. It's mere 250 levels per perk, but yeah, it's still hell of a lot to upgrade at least two for an average player. And we got 6 slots for these perks... Well, I already pointed out in my two long-posts how the legendary perk system is flawed to the core and must be completely reworked. The only hope we have is that they will listen (not only to me ofc, but to lots of people who have the same thoughts and who already pointed out the same issues as well)
---
YoU ArE nOt FoRcEd!
---
no i didnt insult you. clearly this is too touchy any issue for you too discuss. hope you find a more fun game to play i guess.
---
As I said to the other person, they started the whole conversation with an insult, and have done nothing but insult me since
---
"Stop comparing you epeen" etc, it's unnecessary
---
Last three queen fights in a row, all after mutation and 25% health. Crash. Load back in, she‚Äôs dead. No rewards and ton of ammo and stimpacks gone. One of the ones that crashed was on a private server too.
---
True enough, if you don't ask you won't get. You may want to include what platform you are on as it is important.
---
How far along are you with the run?
---
Yeah it ends the event but you dont get your 2 treasury notes.
---
Id be OK if they did a full catalog once a year with 50-70% off everything.
---
Bethesda would make a metric F-ton of money.
---
I‚Äôm liking it for the extra direction in terms of fun stuff to do.
---
Aside from the caps on gold/notes/etc. the rest is called playing the game. I admit the grind for bullion can be tedious, but you will get there, as you also get treasury notes for public events. I have gone to the trade box and have had more then 20 a day just from doing events for the legendary run. 
---
If everything was super easy then there would be nothing to do. The tadpoles and pioneer scouts are not meant to be done in an hour. But they are a nice change of pace if you find yourself with nothing to do. If so, pick a badge and work on it. Some of them require stuff like revive a player, as on here and you will easily find someone to help, or ask in a team.
---
Only rank 9 right now been playing the game for 3 days
---
I'm a level 27
---
"the only people that get burned by duping are RMT monglords, greedy traders and people who think that they are invalidated by someone else having more shiny things than them."
---
After I made a comment that I felt the dupers were screwing people who put real effort into the game is clearly implying that I belong to one of those groups, and is absolutely an insult
---
As was all the crap about comparing my epeen, I mean who the hell thinks like that?
---
It usually only japes to me when I‚Äôm farming 4-6 workshops on a private server
---
I always carry a mid level 10mm just for these kinds of events, I'm melee build as well. Especially for completing events right now
---
Good on you, I'll catch him next week. I'm level 31. I'm doing the steady moderate grind, I'm not a bloodied build yet.
---
Sweet, always nice to see new players. Been playing for alittle over 2 months now, loving this game.
---
Are you sure it wasn't just your world? Some worlds reset, not all at once.
---
I just got offline 15 mins ago tho so idk
---
Ive been sharing philanthropist and bodyguards lately if not strange in numbers.
---
I've seen conflicting things about this and wish I could find something definitive. It seems to me that the slots are account-bound, but the cards are individual per character unless I'm misunderstanding something
---
I'm doing this for the people that matter, for the bois.
---
NW isn't terrible, it's just not worth the time and the exp system is shit. I'll play every so often, but not seriously.  
---
However, I do understand that 'need' to get all the SCORE you can. Especially this week with one weekly requiring at least 3 trips into NW, it feels like they're trying to shove everyone in to it.
---
They recycle skins. So you'll see a bundle one week, then see it a month later.
---
so if  the first statement offended you, its because you are one of the 3 things listed. not really an insult if thats how you self identify lmao
---
and you you arent familiar with the colloquialism "epeen" then you must be really new to the internet. its not an insult. you semm to just be really really sensitive.
---
sometimes there are one day sales but not currently
---
Agree. You can screen capture on xbox and share but this method you offer is 10x better
---
nothing in u/TheToddPoster 's convo is really an instult dude. hes trying to get you to understand that this isnt that big of a deal and that you just need to chill.
---
this shit will work itself out, just like it has every time before. its nothing new.
---
Literally happened 5 minutes ago, just as I was about to kill a legendary sheepsquatch ... I love this game, but I also fucking hate it
---
And if you don‚Äôt want people being asses on public servers melting the Queen don‚Äôt draw attention to them. Not to be rude, but most people don‚Äôt need them as most people are showing they can‚Äôt be responsible. Its why I tend to not drop nukes, or do Encryptids on public servers anymore.
---
I get this too. I am on Xbox and I have had this for the past week ( just as The seasons started week two) and on and off over the past year. Ticket sent to BGS and got back from them the  usual cut and pasted responses with no real explanation or expertise in at least finding out the issue. So, I cancelled the Fallout 1st. Shame as I do love this game (When ‚Äúit just works‚Äù) but it‚Äôs not worth anymore if my money and time. I do hope there‚Äôs a solution for you.
---
yes its 5000 candy
---
Whitespring has all of them in one spot with a lot of plans
---
Quick question: do we need to pass him? He is always ahead of me, so I figured he was more of like a marker to encourage you to play. Is passing him needed to complete the season pass? Thanks.
---
This is so wholesome.
---
God bless you sir
---
Everyone mutated runs that. It doesn't stack. You could share something else tbh.
---
I'd spend so much money if it weren't 20 dollars for a damn skin that's still broken to this day.
---
I dont even play NW anymore. Had some dealings with hackers. I made it to overseer lvl 5 before the hackfest began. After I was unceremoniously killed. I watched the rest of the match through the hacker, and omfg. A nuke was launched on his head and he sponged it, the health bar never moved. Next 2 teams converged on him as the circle was now tiny. The hacker just stood and took the entirety of bullets the two teams had to offer. He quickly spun and killed one team with a pipe revolver, while the other team threw grenades and shot explosive arrows. He killed them too. Winner winner chicken bullshit dinner. That's 3 matches with different people, I quit
---
Inspiration doesn't stack, most people run it for the xp.
---
Geeeit um! Geeit um good!
---
Amen brother
---
I‚Äôm really happy with it since it‚Äôs not too hard for me to level up but also because it‚Äôs free. I was honestly expecting them to slap a price tag on it. The fact that you get free stuff from doing things you‚Äôd normally do in game is very nice.
---
Everyone is probably having this because a new duplication glitch was discovered and exposed. You‚Äôve probably noticed people are crowding train station vendors too, I‚Äôm sure. Check YouTube for more details, a guy named Demonasylum.
---
Most likely, no, you are safe. You did not dupe yourself.
---
Heard that, didn't realize they didn't stack. Does inspirational stack past 3*?
---
Whatever, you are totally blinded by what you want, have fun.
---
Oh good think I‚Äôll hold onto it then always wanted one anyway and at least that way  it‚Äôs one less that‚Äôll be getting duped
---
I feel like I‚Äôve checked Whitesprings a lot, but I tend to scroll through the known plans quickly, it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôve just missed it or read it as known. Worth checking though!
---
You are fighting a losing battle my friend. They don‚Äôt care how it was made but will surely complain when banned for accepting it or making it. But for the moment they now have a shiny bright toy to make them feel better lol.
---
Adamantium limbs. Not alot of people use it so it's a nice buff for them
---
All of these post saying to share a commonly used perk card like strange in numbers or inspirational are bad advice. Cards don't stack. You don't get lock pick level 2 if someone is sharing 1 rank and you're at rank 1.
---
It's the same for every other perkcard. Share something people will want, don't use as a default please.
---
25% less VATS cost is a legendary effect, and those are always randomly determined when a legendary item drop and cannot be modded by the player, outside of hacking the game. Also, zero VATS is no longer possible on rifles, only very low AP cost.
---
I have the same issue too on Xbox for a week now. Comes and goes. Feel you pain.
---
If you haven‚Äôt played since wastelanders, I‚Äôd recommend starting a new character. There‚Äôs a bunch of subtle things you‚Äôll run across that are completely different. New locations, random encounters and npcs.
---
Lol a hardware ban because the developers leave loads of bugs and glitches in their game...
---
I‚Äôll be honest with you dude, I was disappointed in the gauss minigun. It‚Äôs not bad, but it‚Äôs not worth the grind to get to allied with the raiders. If it was just the grind, or just the modules, it‚Äôd be better. But you can roll hundreds before you get something that works for you. Same goes for the armor, I‚Äôve got a full set of cav assassins secret service, it‚Äôs great armor, but a full set is almost unattainable legitimately. Best thing that came of my rep grind was the chemist backpack, and the farmable tiles.
---
Maybe they are trying to save the mode before deciding whether or not to remove it?
---
Wastelanders dlc is about 30hrs gameplay. Brotherhood of steel is coming later this year.
---
Good for you.
---
I'm offended to be associated with those groups because I believe them to be garbage, so you associating me with them is an insult, and you knew it was when you made the statement, but now you're trying to backpedal to save face
---
And see that's another thing, I provide logical, reasoned arguments and all you can respond with is "you semm to just be really really sensitive"
---
95% of the legacies are duped anyway... I have one, traded a godroll handmade for it long time ago. It has a chance it is duped too... but not sure.
---
You can get bored with it realy fast :)
---
-Does the Mothman dance in a new Bogcrawler 1st outfit while saving up monthly atoms to use for legendary run skips.
---
Broseph i have 700 and am at 240
---
Thanks for this.  Do you have a price list also for the asylum hats?
---
In the Eastern Stat Penitentiary, there is a heavy metal door locked by a console next to it. Go in there, and check the silver carts next to the hospital beds in that room. Guaranteed spawn point.
---
Radscorpion Egg Omelette also cures one addiction.
---
The grind is a pain in the ass. Was easy for raiders when the glitch was around. Without the glitch it's awful, at least for the settlers. But the plasma caster and gauss minigun are fun. I love the shit outta the plasma caster. The gauss pistol is super disappointing, its range is trash but it is strong. I dont have the shotgun yet but I heard its insane
---
Then they rally need to fix the exp reward system. Team placement should have the biggest impact, not time.
---
From what i've beentold Zorbo is just a way of showing you how much time you got left of the battle pass. If he reaches the end before you it's game over you lost and can't obtain anymore rewards then those already unlocked. Hope this helped. 
---
Ps. I'll smack him for you
---
Disease cure fixes it.
---
Easy recipe to find and craft.
---
Or buy them from other players vendors.
---
The solution is gonna be to wait for a fix, since this is an extremely common problem judging by posts online. Typical Beth support though haha, I'm gonna keep playing on my Xbox since I still really enjoy the game
---
(Just thought I'd share this here and see if this helped anyone at all. Not sure why someone would downvote it. )
---
One per day spawns at Big Al‚Äôs Tatoo Parlor (where you do Biv quests). Go inside, go to the room with the tatoo chairs, go to the front desk where the computer is, and look in the upper right cubby hole.
---
It‚Äôs the one guaranteed spawn I know of. There are also 3 med-x in the same room hidden about.
---
The beeswax during fasnacht was great. Cricket hoards and a tanagra town will let you rack up acid pretty quick though.
---
I've a had one do that, the others the bar won't go down at all. Grafton monster in whitespring was the first one I encountered, I could damage it but it healed before I could kill it, emptied quite a bit of ammo into it before I gave up
---
Cause they should try contributing
---
Idk why everyone just saying no instead of explaining. 
---
It works for all normal armor and power armor.
---
However, it doesn‚Äôt not work for anything from the atomic shop, anything bought with gold bullion, or anything legendary. (Although that‚Äôs kinda the same thing) 
---
Basically, if it can be traded or sold between players then super duper works on it. And that pretty much goes for everything except bulking.
---
I went from 50 to 53 in one event with no booster and only inspiration perk on. Radiation rumble level up isn‚Äôt as bad as it seems but if it keeps only going up up and it would take like two weeks to go from
---
1000 to 1001
---
Yeah someone was selling a bunch of different kinds of legacy weapons for 10 caps at their camp and I decided to buy a BE flamer and the guy msg me to follow and drop me like 4 other guns after I told him I was a rifle build. I don't know if I'll get banned for simply trading I guess but who knows
---
Yiiiikes. Really just gotta do anything to rub that grind in, huh? Thanks again for the info; I'm somewhere around level 125ish so I haven't noticed things creeping up much yet. It's a fucking disappointment though, lmao.
---
which system?
---
PC
---
Why the hell can't we have the gramophone, for that matter
---
sometimes it's at the Whitesprings Medical vendorbot (inside resort main building, downstairs, near other vendor stores)
---
Nah disease cute don‚Äôt fix it bro
---
I get them alot from events. I keep a stash now because I went months without finding one
---
Really? He's WAAAAY ahead of me.
---
1. Congratulations on discovering diminishing returns. All resistances in this game work like that. Also, think about this for a moment. You're in the immediate vicinity of a bloody nuclear explosion and you seriously think simply popping a pill is gonna save you from that? Just throw on some protective gear, dude...
---
2. Them's the breaks. Either mainline the RadShield and RadAway, or do what everyone else does and use Chinese stealth armor or  power armor.
---
3. Not gonna happen. The crew that's currently maintaining the game - for very small values of "maintaining" - does not, in my estimation, have the technical aptitude to implement a new damage model (at least not without breaking the whole game in multiple new and interesting ways). And putting hazmat-suit-level rad protection on Secret Service armor would make both PA and hazmat suits largely obsolete, so it's a bad design decision for those reasons alone.
---
I am hearing from facebook about SOME SHIT IS GOING DOWN, MAN! Wtf is happening? Mass deletions of NW glitch items? Emergency patch on a new super easy dupe glitch?
---
It took me 8 matches to survive long enough to find 9 creatures to kill. 37 minutes for that one challenge, as I said. I can't play competitive multiplayer games because I have a neurological tremor.
---
More like 2 weeks after it left lmao
---
I don't. I love when my teammates run that as their share card.
---
You'll be fine
---
Is this confirmed on all weapons? My 2 shot double barrel was def not as effective as my exploding bullet one was.
---
LEGEND!
---
Yeah, it amazes me how few people know about that
---
I dunno man I feel like I'll still probs get banned cause he just dropped them in a bag and was like here ya go.
---
I wish they would at least bring back the gyro bracers (I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs what they were called), where it gave you improved weapon stability and handling. 
---
Anything‚Äôs better than just melee-based mods. Hell, if we could put Tesla coil mods on all pieces like before to do decent area damage to enemies, that would actually be sweet. It‚Äôs still balanced pretty well, a nice give and take of decision making.
---
might want to check if it's free via microsoft game pass (heard conflicting information).
---
Maybe they'll fix it on Tuesday or until patch 21
---
Yes, thank you, but what if it is only a 1 star legendary, is it better to keep the anti armour one or the exploding bullets? Are the damage outputs comparable?
---
ok kid whatever. you just want to be mad. stay mad then lmao
---
youre the one with the issue dude not me. duping didnt ruin my life like it clearly did yours. üòÇ
---
If you're on xbox and don't want them ill take them lol. But for real you'll be fine. If they banned everyone who owned a duped weapon they'd lose half their players. They will only go after people who have a stupid amount of the guns on them
---
Exactly. It's really quite sad. They'd rather the game close down than give them the ability to buy convenience. The only people who have the right to complain about that are the people who reach 100 legitimately and feel like the buyin option devalues their achievements.. And those people wouldn't as they like the game and would rather it be properly funded.
---
Yeah... periodically had this issue over the past year - looks like there‚Äôs going to be a long wait for them to do anything as they have a lot to fix, especially with new dupe wave happening now. At least you can still play!
---
And again, no logical argument or reason, just verbal diarrhea
---
Well, yes! Hahaha, I know what they do, just not sure as to damage output of one versus the other. Although, I get that this could vary slightly per weapon type.
---
God when I started out I remember I had like 20 but now I got none
---
Yeah, I'll be happy to sell it.
---
Also I noticed yesterday the workshop map popups have gone, so unless you google or already know, there is no way of knowing what the workshop has in the way of resources.
---
Sometimes I think Bethesda change things just for the sake of change.
---
People cheat on any game engine though, and most of the time you don't just randomly stumble over godmode and duping techniques. I'd rather say that if cheaters didn't exist we wouldn't have these issues.
---
Yeah I'm fairly familiar with f76, I played when it came out and then took a break when nukashine was new then got on for wastelands I'm about level 180ish but my original beat gun I used before this was a ghoul slayers explosive HM
---
I honestly have zero idea what you're even talking about
---
So you genuinely dont get double the damage output because it's a shotgun, over say, a hunting rifle?
---
Building a CAMP is the best part, imo. Also you can only sell unwanted ammo from your camp vending machine, which is a great source of income.
---
*puts away coffee mug* Perfect timing!
---
dont see how its an insult unless you are 
---
A an RMT trader
---
B greedy
---
or 
---
C  someone who think that they are invalidated by someone else having more shiny things than them 
---
its pretty clear that you are option C
---
Indeed, I never bother with anything locked in the game, I became jaded with that mini game months ago.
---
Auto unlock would be awesome.
---
ugh. had a similar issue with the raider version of this quest. 
---
Took me a few retries (not fast skipping through dialogue helped in the end)
---
i think its bed time for you
---
I was thinking explosive over anti armour from my messing with some guns but was, and am, happy to learn from better experienced players. üôÇ
---
I'm none of those things, it's an insult because they implied I was. People can be insulted without it being some weird psychological shit, I hate greedy people
---
I don't care if people have more stuff than me, as long as it's obtained legitimately
---
By your logic I shouldn't report a heroin dealer because the only reason I was doing it would be because I'm jealous of their money, whereas it's really just because they're a bad person
---
Alright I hop back on real quick if you're on. GT TitanUp323.
---
Damn, I was really hoping the xp counter would reset for each chapter...
---
I always have all serums at my vendors 
---
My GT is Eingeborenen, I‚Äôll be on most of tomorrow if you still need any
---
I absolutely agree with the OP. I've been waiting months for the clean magazine rack to cycle back in cause I missed it the first go around.
---
Cmon man, coding is hard! Especially when you aren't qualified or trained! What do you expect - logical and user-friendly development? Well expect away, cos you ain't gettin it!
---
I have received every reward (multiple times) except the backpack and definitely have lost count of the amount of times running it. During Fasnacht alone had to be over a hundred (parade, escort, sell to vendor until or do a daily and repeat). Just keep trying, it will happen.
---
I think it's time for you to learn how to form a logical argument without resulting to childish insults
---
Or you could just buy fallout 1st when you need the atoms... The Rest is a b√≥nus....
---
Nah this is a shit take. Literally every single looter like this has RNG weapons. Be grateful you have trading to actually get what you want.
---
Alr I just added you
---
And read their comments now, they've been insulting me all the way
---
I have the legendary effect plus all the needed mods
---
The gauss minigun, yes. The plasma caster isn't good, as the gatling gun greatly exceeds it in every aspect. Don't bother with the T-65, just stick with a set of T-51.
---
I disagree. Up to recently people were saying that there isn't enough late game content and there isn't much to do for high levels.
---
Now:
---
"The season system is to much grind"
---
"The legendary cards are to much grind"
---
It is legendary, you are not suppose to get all of them
---
He started ahead of everyone, you've got to catch up to him
---
I'm surprised Bethesda hasn't made all legendary items not tradable.
---
i‚Äôve never seen anyone above 250
---
No. And what objects are you referring to, the loot?
---
Then also raised it to being able to turn in 10x and 100x the amounts at a time which should help.
---
Wasn‚Äôt this done a long time ago?
---
Mine also has gone back and forth. Yesterday I had normal icons but today I had the city icons on one server but not the next one
---
Would you actually utilize all of them tho? I could see one or two I'd run all the time, but to switch them out, or use a set for long periods of time? I swap enough just when crafting, I don't want to swap MORE.
---
Where are you getting 1500 from - its 450 to max upgrade a legendary perk surely?
---
Its got a lot worse after the whiners reduced the animated card value to 1 a level from 5 a level but none of my playing around showed 1,500.
---
The Plasma Caster does more damage and has much better accuracy. I've been using it for A couple of weeks now. The ammo is more expensive but that's the tradeoff.
---
Raiders and Foundation have same issue.
---
We got good characters that help with raid vault 79 and after that no quest line or something with noone, only 2 repeated quest every day. Nice.
---
the problem is that diminishing returns in this game are savage, and rather than putting in numbers that actually have the desired effect Bethesda put nonsense numbers that look attainable but are backed by invisible effects that completely turn things on their head.
---
How much rad resist do you need to match a hazmat suit do you think? 1000? 10000?
---
It's actually not possible. The game caps rad resistance at 90%, which the hazmat suit offers as an invisible effect, meaning it actually gives ~98% overall. If you want to just match the invisible part of the hazmat you need radiation times 1000 rad resist, so to resist 60/sec of a nuke zone takes 60 000 rad resist, to match the 98% with the hard cap removed is not actually possible as the largest rad resist the game can handle of 2 147 483 647 is not actually enough to get there. 
---
SO to do what a hazmat suit does would take crazy numbers that the devs don't want to put in the game because giving a hazmat suit 2 billion rad resist looks exactly as outrageous as the effect of the hazmat suit is, while 1000 looks in line and attainable, when the reality is it isn't.
---
it's all about "daily active users"... 
---
having the same user switch game modes, might tweak their stats... the same user logging into both, could count as two (or more) active log ins. 
---
So one user becomes "many", giving the impression that their application is averaging way more activity than it actually is.
---
Like if I were to walk into Lakeside Cabins, took all the turrets, then left. Would they eventually respawn?
---
What's your GT? I'm not seeing anything
---
its on the pc xbox game pass for free
---
Miner I'd like to fuck?
---
you dont get it dude. noone thinks that the in game guns are so important. its YOU that has the problem here.
---
you can sit there and act like you dont care what other people have while simultaneously saying that now everything is ruined because people can get stuff for no work.
---
you dont seem to understand that those positions are incongruent 
---
you keep saying that your work you put in to get the gear is worthless now (invalidated) because people are duping (having more things)
---
hes RIGHT, you are getting worked up about this when you shouldnt, its a VIDEO GAME. it does not matter. none of it. get over yourself.
---
I share mysterious savior level 2
---
They could optimize NW a lot more. Currently it takes over 70 seconds from time of death to join another lobby of NW. even then you have to wait for the vote and intermission. This isn‚Äôt even addressing the major issues on why people avoid NW but optimising join times and UI management would drastically boost experience

People would actually shit their pants then send the dry cleaning bill to Bethesda

it is the same fun to kill u by high-lvl player as u would kill a 1lvl guy who just started the buggy madness of Appalachia. And by this I mean no fun at all. 
---
btw I made 117 steaks at this factory and than just sold them for 0 caps. They are heavy. I do soaps and put them on a hotkey. So u can do the same harvesting them and cooking at ur camp.
---
I don't understand human greed, I'm done, I always said this community was the best I've been a part of, now I know it's just as greedy and corrupt as everything else in this world, nobody cares about other people being hurt as long as they get something out of it
---
I'm done, I'm incapable of understanding the greed
---
Thanks for the detailed explanation!
---
And emojis, like a child
---
While I understand your attitude a lot of players were hoping for the LM's to be discounted as the original notification of the sale didn't specify weapons and armour  - it was a "legendary purveyor sale".
---
like "store" items after claiming the workshop? 
---
... i know you can "blueprint" some player crafted items, sometimes, but not sure.

Suspensions started going out A little while ago, not sure if anyone will be perma-banned though

Yeah, I think I was able to use the turrets I took for my own camp
---
I can't speak for anyone but myself but I would gladly take the weekly offline maintenance if it meant fixes are being applied. Isn't that way of most live service games? Release content, read the bug reports, go offline, apply patch, rinse and repeat? I guess we are expecting too much from a mutli-billion dollar gaming company these days. /s
---
Well, I don‚Äôt know when I will pass Zorbo, but getting those free stuff is great.
---
It's a survivor game. The idea is to make it to the end. I like the xp being heavily weighted toward time in. To longer you last the better it is.
---
You can use 6 perks and can level them all to 4*
---
And you continue to prove my point, you are still incapable of forming a logical argument to support your position, have a great day
---
*If* you're a duper, I hope you get banned
---
If not have a wonderful life
---
Oh yeah... People grinded their asses off to get that SCORE. Lets roll them back. That would be great.
---
I wish they just track dupers and people who got duped stuff and wiped their accounts clean.
---
Have a wonderful life
---
Not unless someone crafts them. Lakeside Cabins is a workshop. The turrets were put there by someone else.
---
Alr, just tell me if you want me to switch worlds.
---
Walking and playing would be pretty cool too. Strolls into super mutant camp playing "dueling banjos"
---
Never going to happen.
---
This needs more attention
---
What? With the rolling xp its  not capped. I have friends already at the 40 score mark who have gone full xp gain modded. Too lazy to do it myself so just doing dallies and weeklies (ignoring most NW ones) I'm just hitting 30 and thats a big jump to 40 with the increasing score amount needed per level.
---
I am used to solo, so I don‚Äôt interact much. But when I see members of my public team in the same event as me, I like to open a lunchbox and share the bonus with everyone. Particularly at Line in the Sand event.

What did you do, that you that far away? I just nearby that space monkey, but trying to do every challenge to get some points.

Mods like sensor array will carryover put anything involving the headlamp won‚Äôt

imagine getting this worked up about internet game weapons.
---
its your epeen dude. do you see now? the game was rigged from the start
---
Atlas is now closed? Huh, I should visit it again.
---
It is easy event for the beginner
---
Yea either that or what happened to me earlier, I'm in the middle of an event fighting the shit out of numerous honey beasts, and kicking ass while what's his face collects honey, and we're about halfway through he was on his way to the 3rd beehive, and suddenly even tho I noticed no timer, the event must have ended or something, it never said that I failed the event like it usually would if I didn't finish in time, but it was just over and I got no rewards whatsoever üò†
---
it's actually *y=160x-120* where **x** is your current level and **y** is xp needed to reach the next level. I am unsure why people try to make the equation all complicated with parenthesis and that...
---
Lmfao!!!!
---
I 100% agree. Even that would be insane.
---
I have put hundreds of hours into this game and am only level 246. Yes ive had looong spells where I havent played the game, but I was so damn burnt out on the grind and repetition it would of been really bad for my mental health to of kept playing honestly. 
---
Level 1000+ Just seems fucking insane.
---
Pretty much my game in a nutshell...
---
Hell yes, a separate fair start gamemode without rediculously nonsensical op character builds from the base game
---
Thanks for the offer. I enjoy roaming around killing things with my two step goodbye
---
You just enjoy screwing with others, I knew all along, I just thought there might be a human under it all
---
roll forward, delete all items, all characters naked in barren camps. perfection.
---
I'd be ecstatic just to get some new arm mods
---
I move a decent amount of serums for 350 and some of the more desired common plans (at 25 caps each) but it used to be that any mid tier explosive or FFR legendary would sell easily for 3k caps, now to sell them at all it's more like 1k. One star bloodied heavy guns would fly out of there for 1k, now nobody wants them. Unyielding armor hardly sells unless it's three star no matter how cheap it is and even the three star stuff with decent rolls hardly moves for 500 caps. It's not entirely because of duping though, there's a lot of other factors contributing, maybe even more than duping is, but the duping really isn't helping.
---
No, you're absolutely right.  My grind for Bullion was basically done when I got the Secret Service chest + Jetpack to jump jet around without having to put on power armor.
---
Pretty worth it, but not really all that different from using it in P.A. except not needing Fusion cores.
---
Other than that, it's just random no-streakbreaker RNG grinds, and really slow reputation and currency grind with hard daily limits.
---
Plus, bugs galore.  This game does have its good moments, but those are mostly in the single-player style story campaign missions.  Once that's up... well, honestly there's not much left.
---
I accidentally ended up with a second month of Fallout 1st, so I'll probably play a little longer (enough to finish the Raider half of the storyline, as I sided with Foundation first) but after that, I'll probably be gone.  
---
Game doesn't have enough *fun* content to keep me around much longer.  Grind != Fun for me.
---
Level 45 is the max for the Fatman. My heavy Gunner carries this around because with Bear Arms it's basically weightless, and it let's me use up any mini-nukes I come across.
---
It's useless except in very specific circumstances where it is incredible fun! If you see a mega herd of 20+ radstag near Colonel Kelly's monument this is how you hunt them. Near my base Wendigo's hide in tree's and it can be difficult to shoot them from below, but carpetting the area with nuclear explosions gets there attention.
---
it's the purge....

Yeah, I also play world of warships which has XP, free xp, elite xp, commander xp, elite commander xp, silver, doubloons, coal, oil, steel, research points, ranked tokens, clan tokens.
---
Every update (4 week cycle) theres a new event currency that is removed at the end of the following update.
---
I'm level 420+ and, as stated in another reply by u/glazedhamster , I, too, am sure that I can smell the fear when I rock up to swiss cheese whatever tries to shit on your parade.
---
That fear turns into excitement as the realization sinks in that their personal bodyguard has just arrived. It's adorable and one of the reasons I still play. :)
---
Sometimes, when I have the time, I invite low levels on a tour of Appalachia. Most low levels play stealth to conserve percious ammo and not be swarmed, by romping thru locations with a lot of high level mobs they can witness first hand that going loud can also be extremely fun. 
---
If they stay with me all the way I take them back to my camp and give them a goody bag. 
---
Granted, this doesn't happen that often but every now and again you run into a low level who's very eager to go outside of their comfort zone and just roll with it. Sure, they will most likely die a lot because I want them to tag every enemy and a surprise high level mob can insta gib them but that's part of the learning curve and with me around, your loot is most definitely not going to be stolen. :)
---
On that note, if you are a low level, don't be scared, run away or log off. Most of us want to make your stay in Appalachia a pleasant one.
---
Yeah at first i was like wow my Whole construction Just takes up a quarter of the budget! Than i was like damn my decorations take up everything!
---
It‚Äôs going to be an official event called ‚ÄúA Colossal Problem‚Äù in Monongah Mine. It is going to be triggered via nuking the mine. That is a guaranteed spawn like SBQ. Coming Patch 23.
---
You‚Äôre telling me a day rolled back of score is that drastic.
---
I just find super low levels and dump one of each plan I have in front of them. They take them all, signal with a heart and then I run away. No one buys them really unless it‚Äôs people that just want to learn everything.. like me.
---
Yep.  If it weren't for Covid-19 and people having spare time to do stuff like play this game, I honestly believe that FO76 would be having a much worse time right now.  Even with its Steam release and now its addition to Xbox Game Pass.
---
Only 5800 hours left for the 20 atoms!
---
I've completed the repeatable a bunch, i might do a post/guide on how i got this much xp in this short span of time.
---
If you would stop Buying these games that have problems and boycott them till the company did what you asked your games wouldnt be so fucked.
---
Oh okay that‚Äôs great, thank you!  It‚Äôs just most of the videos I‚Äôve seen he spawns in that weird ass forest with the red vines and trees, but every time I go there in a nuke zone I can never find him.
---
This was the best suggestion all along.
---
It sounded to me like a children crowd cheering at the Monster Mash bashing.
---
Yea it's a pain
---
Because a person can't back up their position, but refuses to change their mind
---
People like you cause the world's problems
---
I just fought one for the first time. It spawned in the Overgrown Sundew Grove after Scorched Earth. Three of us valiantly wasted a ton of time and ammo before a *second* nuke dropped. It took the entire server to take it down, alongside the Queen and all her adds. It also spawns tough wendigo adds, and its scream sends you all running away in fear for a few seconds.
---
I got a nice legendary and it's vocal sacs for I presume the mount.
---
Was an absolutely nuts fight. Thing had three times the HP of the Queen, I swear.
---
I think we need new PA mods more than Legendary perks, especially arm mods.
---
What have you been doing for all this time?
---
I agree.  I always wondered why they don't just have the full catalog available somewhere (if only on the official website or something) with the discounts rotating, but not the inventory.
---
Maybe with exceptions only for really seasonal content like holiday items, but I feel even those should come back out of season sometimes for fun.
---
Honestly, I feel that most players won't stick around for a long time.  For the few months out of the year you can hold their interest, why not give them a big selection of stuff to buy, so you're more likely to get their dollars, rather than hope that they're interested in the small set of stuff you show 'em every week.
---
By the time the atom shop has something your players might actually spend real money to get atoms for... they might already be gone and have quit this game.
---
Bruh
---
Omg yes, this happened 2 days ago and it was soooo frustrating
---
It's just more accurate. You start at level 1, not 0. You also need 200 XP to level 2. That's the only time you need 200XP instead of 160. 
---
For a "near enough", yours obviously works as well. :)
---
I would actually shit my pants if they rolled it back. I did a purveyor run yesterday and got a bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet and a JE radium rifle. üòÇ
---
yeah i could see this being quite a useful feature
---
Apparently I‚Äôm asking myself that I‚Äôm level 205 I haven‚Äôt seen 1 yet
---
You, too, assumed that the assaultron took the errr seduction command quite literally?
---
Poor idiot Calvin.
---
I would also like this since my jetpack is in an arm and I can't do that anymore haha
---
You're just unlucky.  They're not SUPER rare.  Just as rare as any of the other primary legendary perks on weapons.
---
Mumbles really is that cruel.
---
I'd have to disagree. Most the content that people complain about is the grindy MMO inspired content. Maybe if they actually added good content then it wouldn't be so bad. like proper Raids,  an Arena, maybe VR terminals (like Operation: Anchorage) for TDM or CTF,  horde mode's with teir rewards blah blah blah you get the idea.
---
Daily quests, repeatable old events, and chasing different currencies is just boring as hell. Especially since it's pretty pointless for the most part. Nothing challenges you in the endgame anyway.
---
 Here's to hoping the Wendigo Collosus event is decent. But honestly we should have at least +4 boss events similar to that by now too, and they should be challenging enough to actually put our skills/build to the test.
---
Im sorry but I disagree. Thats a very bad idea. Especially since Bethesdas track record with fixing things in this game has not been the best. Do we really want to trust them to reset everyone‚Äôs characters back a full day. With the way they handle everything i don‚Äôt trust them not to accidentally delete everything off our characters. We shouldn‚Äôt  be punished because Bethesda can‚Äôt fix their own game. 
---
What about the people who spent time legitimately grinding out atoms, score points, treasury notes or grinded hard for a good legendary weapon.all resetting characters does is screw people who legitimately earned those rewards. Dupers will find some new glitch in a few weeks and get everything back.
---
Oh where is that tape, do you remember?

the lack of self awareness here is putting my side in orbit over saturn

---
125 is around 20K XP per level, so you should notice it now that you know how it works. ;)
---
I agree, Very off putting.
---
Sincerely hope they find a way to identify duped items and just ban/delete that character.
---
Oh ok my bad
---
I'm telling you it's not fair to punish fair players for something cheaters done.
---
Yeah, I did participate in some of the duping, but to be honest it doesn‚Äôt really feel as good to me as getting something awesome from the purveyor. I have b2525 ‚Äòs and be legacy‚Äôs now. But it almost feels plastic to me. They‚Äôre cool and all, but something just feels off.
---
&gt; if they add more Legendary perks in the future (which I would assume they would)
---
I mean it took until wastelanders when they added new normal perks and those were just rifle cards for bows.. Still no perks for throwing weapons..
---
As I said, I'm aware, I was all along, but you're a horrible person, incapable of logic, reason, or seemingly thought, and I will waste no opportunity to inform you of that
---
Maybe daily Ops will be something like that.
---
I only want it if it reduces the weight of stored power armor.
---
I've horded a full set of every power armor so I am desperate to display them, but I will never give up 80lbs of stash space to display them in my camp...
---
I use the Portable Power perk to carry them all around, and have designed my base so I can display my power armor briefly... Power armor is iconic fallout, but it is challenging to love it in this game.
---
boooooo stop generalizing
---
Hey I‚Äôm around the same level! Philanthropy is satisfying in 76, even if the only gratitude people can give is an emoji lol

It's currently on gamepass but I'm having the 1:5:1 issue so I can't even get into the main menu yet. Hoping the servers are just currently busy and it won't last too long.
---
EXCITING.
---
Nice, thanks for the tip. I knew Wendigo drop screws for some inexplicable reason but I didn‚Äôt think you could find a bunch in one place.
---
I have done most quest gotten all pioneer quest possum backpack done rebels quest space quest overseer almost all of the world quest never even 1
---
I guess that‚Äôs the problem with the game as well as the developers. I‚Äôm sorry but if a game has a new dupe glitch every couple of months, I think it‚Äôs less of a problem with dupers and more of a problem with the game itself.
---
I have considered duping in the past but at this point I don‚Äôt know if there is anything I even want lol. I don‚Äôt need caps, ammo, or junk items and I have my full armor set and weapons so I‚Äôm just kinda chilling I guess üòÇ
---
You did not get a JE radium rifle. Explosive radium rifles are legacies and do not drop anymore.

Lady stuck in the Morgantown airport storage closet is the most horrific for me.
---
It's one thing to be scared out of your mind my a monster that eviscerates you. It's another when it creeps slowly towards you and you get to experience everything in slow, minute detail before the end.
---
Trolls are a plague on the internet
---
OK, good. But AP cost reductions got slightly nerfed a few patches ago so that zero AP rifles are no longer possible. (I'm not sure, but zero AP might still be achievable on the 10mm pistol.) You can still get it very, very low, but now down to zero.
---
I‚Äôve done all but 4
---
Good sumup, my F76 day also looks pretty much like this. (Add in some Vendor hopping, which is basically the same grind and rng as when hunting mobs, either you end up in spending an hr server hopping with just nothing than caps spend for fast travelling or you're lucky (&lt;1% dropchance) and you'll find something good for a good price). Sometimes i really feel like that it might be better to grind West Tek for an hr instead of player vendor hopping.
---
Another thing worth mentioning are the weapons. You could buy extremly insane weapons for extremly insane prices.... but what for? Those weapons are eligible to obliterate planetes (sometimes even galaxies) with one mag... My 1\* bloodied Fixer is technically the same as a good 3\* bloodied fixer because there is nothing (mob wise) that makes a difference. 95% of the mobs die in 1 shot. The minor/majors are just ... yea ... not groundbreaking, just ... nice to have. They just raise the rarity of the wepon because the god of rng has millions of possibilities to roll you a shitty one (ok, now that we have a new dupe going round, they're maybe not longer THAT rare, but as we all know, all those previous dupes didn't even change anything on the economy). It's like... you're sitting on weaps of MASS Destruction, but there is just no MASS :D 
---
I would suggest to implement something to the craft system that you are able to craft the weapon that you like but make it probably worthwhile to grind for the components or plans to roll minor/major or heck...even prefixes.
---
I guess, it‚Äôs just that Bethesda seems unwilling to punish anyone at this point. It seems as if things can run rampant regardless. It strikes me as a bit weird.
---
How would you leverage FOMO? That seems like Bethesda's only shtick.
---
Haha k. Cause if that did happen then this game is much more broken than just a dupe method.
---
Your assuming this glitch is 24 hours old. The dupe has been around a long time and only became public yesterday. Before that a select few were duping and selling god tier and legacy for cash. By resetting the system it‚Äôs those players who benefit again by getting their real money economy back and everyone else gets hurt. Sorry. Terrible idea
---
And you buy that the same way you buy atoms (PS store for me for example)?
---
Yeah I wish I had a JE Radium rifle haha
---
Ah god damn it. I was waiting specifically for a module discount and now that's just for nought.
---
You don't.
---
when there is a reward of 20 atoms for playing the game for 7600 hours. this shit does not surprise
---
All caps (I mean caps, not caps) should be removed so EVERYONE can play their own playstyle. Hardcore or not.
---
Look, if you didn't care at all about the massive nerf to atoms (even more so if you don't complete the season), it's not that big of a deal.
---
If you did care, you would fully understand why people have a negative leaning towards it. 
---
Bear in mind, even with these people, it's not ALL negative. It's nuanced. It's nowhere near as black and white as the strawman you prop up.
---
It does. Clean Prewar with no radiation sideffect. Which is a shame on one hand as recipes like Brain Bombs require the "normal" found in the wild version of prewar food...
---
 If the game is installed on a secondary drive (so not where Windows is) try going to Windows settings &gt; apps, find it in the list and click 'move'
---
I had the same "no region ping 1 5 1" error, so was wracking my brains doing network and VPN stuff to no avail, but once it had moved over to my C:/ drive, it worked (!)
---
Hello,  
---
could you elaborate a bit ?  
---
If it was constructive, why not.  
---
If it was another 100th post on the same topic ...   
---
What was your criticism, mate ?
---
ooor you count not take the obvious bait and prove that you are clueless, and too attached to a video game.
---
üòí
---
Yeah, this is a complete non-issue. I don't know why everyone complains about every single thing on this game. I've said it before, and i'll say it again, people keep making literally every, if not damn near, issue out to be a mountain when it's a mole hill. 
---
Complain about the dupe exploits, and the people engaging in them, who then ruin shit for the rest of us. Complain about the fucking ammo conversion thing, that shit is legitimate. That's actually a problem.
---
That's close to OCD.
---
Community building event? What's this?
---
what??
---
they are effectively ruining the game. grinding for a reward, albeit even if it's just a chance of it being decent is the loop.
---
why not come out of vault 76 and just get your cheating buddies to give you everything at level 1.  why even bother to play?
---
Not asking for that. Just stinks that with 3,000+ hours in I‚Äôm put at a ‚Äúdisadvantage‚Äù and I use that word loosely, by leveling &amp; playing on all 5 characters over someone who only played on one character exclusively is all....
---
When I heard the Secret Service was going to be the end game faction I thought ‚Äúoh shit we‚Äôre gonna have missions where we assassinate high priority targets or something‚Äù but no we just get a grind
---
I've thankfully never experienced this. 
---
For all the hate this game gets, and it does deserve some of it, it's the most stable Bethesda game I've ever played. Like, it's not even a close call. I have 500 hour on Steam and, most likely, another 500-600 on the Beth launcher. A couple dozen crashes over the first month and, maybe 5-6 since Wastelanders dropped.
---
I really don't know why some have so many crashes while others don't.
---
Sir, I envy you your journey. :)
---
I have to disagree. Rollback items in a day could only remove a very few recently duped items. The majority will remain (as well the magic and hacked weapons).
---
Economy is bad due to caps are worthless. There is no trading channel or any kind of action house. The vending machines are a good start still far from being solve economy problems.
---
Yes duped items are bad for economy, but when you check any mmo end game weapons. They do a time gate around for 1 month. Now in this "casual" game to get a one star bloodied fixer from the purveyor will take 100 days.
---
It‚Äôs just a lot of posts in general. I make a suggestion about improving quality of life for certain players and then all of the super hardcore players get mad. Some people on this sub don‚Äôt understand that not every player is level 400+ and plays 6 hours a day. I just don‚Äôt think that some people are willing to accept changes even if it helps players.
---
Look OP, I'm glad you got there eventually but why do people in general (not just you now) need to have experienced it themselves before they understand fundamental problems. This issue about end-game grind in particular wasn't particularly hard to work out. Seemed pretty self evident.
---
The real lesson from this is if a lot of people are complaining about something, they're probably onto something. Don't just dismiss it out of hand because you feel that it's fine.
---
I‚Äôm going to draw this parallel. There are still individuals who engage in insider trading within the stock market. These select individuals go unseen because their population isn‚Äôt large enough to make a real impact. Now imagine every individual has access to insider information pertaining to corporations. The implications are going to be much larger and destructive. Now back to the game. I don‚Äôt like people who profit off the real-money market, but there will always be individuals who do. But when the economy of said game is in this state, I honestly don‚Äôt know how it can be fixed as Bethesda seems unwilling to punish dupers individually.
---
Its actually Todds boyfriends,  they do it to me too all the time
---
As awesomely helpful this is, my boot drive SSD isn't big enough to hold that in addition to what's there. Which especially sucks because I bought a multi-terabyte drive *specifically* for my games. If this ends up being the only workaround, I'll be extremely disappointed lol.
---
Different priorities. Repair kits just keep the game going for men
---
where are you getting 1500 levels for 1 slot?  1st slot is free, there's 4 ranks per so iirc it's 100 coins for the 1st rank, 150 for the 2nd and 200 for the 4rd so that's 450 points.  you get \~2 per level once you factor in the perk packs I believe so thats 225 levels per slot though you cant earn till 50 and won't be scrapping every last perk cause you actually use some.
---
So maybe \~300ish levels for the 1st slot then 225 for each slot after that?  I could be off a bit but 1500 for 1 slot doesn't sound remotely correct based on what I saw on the pts.
---
I just made a bunch of level 1 BOS rifles, 308 ammo, radaway, and stimpaks for all the level 1s I saw coming out of the vault since it's on game pass now. I hope people give it a chance.
---
The legendary grind, basically running for legendaries and using scrip is how they mostly turn up. I‚Äôve had many and vended them off.
---
Don't sweat it. That happens to me on a daily basis if I don't get enough coffee to get me going. :D
---
What is the community building event?
---
It's not bait to me, it's merely a chance to teach you to be a better person, which you clearly need
---
Exactly man
---
F..K YEAH ! Where do i sign up for preorder ?  I would totaly put her in my CAMP if only to make her 'stop blabbing over the radio' to quote  Beckett
---
You burnt out, same thing happened to me, give it a time, play something else :)
---
How does that work?  
---
Do you save up like 60 radkelp and server hop till the event is up?
---
u/Fair_YTRust any changes after upgrade to 3700x?
---
Love it.
---
/r/jesuschristreddit
---
All good, this is my favorite sub to come to to lose karmas. The amount of corporate bootlickers is staggering. They don‚Äôt want a functioning game, they want to grief people with the most powerful weapons that aren‚Äôt attainable in-game anymore. All the folks that are saying ‚Äúwhy pvp in this game? what pvp??‚Äù are the ones using BE legacies and stealth boys in pvp.
---
Where do we turn in those tickets anyway ? I found a few of them by now and never realised you could exchange them O.o
---
I fucking hate the people that one shot the queen.
---
you can in 76 its just gimped compared to other builds.  but it's not like the game overall is hard.
---
So you think of her as a bit of a MILF i.e. a moleminer I'd like to umm... friend.
---
Hell no,lol. Don't wipe anything.
---
These are the most pathetic posts on the subreddit.
---
omg you are really are that delusional.
---
stop it, get some help
---
I don‚Äôt disagree however the upside of this dupe that‚Äôs flooded the market with legacy and fixers of the highest prices is now caps, ammo, flux etc has become viable trading commodities again and the mid tier weapon table to high has gone from being trade x5 only for the next jump to actually being tradable and profitable. If anything this dupe whilst crashing the top tier has repaired the lower end of the market to a degree
---
I get 5 to 10 legends a day have a crap load of three stars I‚Äôve started selling em in my store cause of weight
---
3star armor 2000
---
3star melee 3000
---
3star range 3250
---
Still overweight and no bloodied
---
Plus I‚Äôm a first player
---
Oh that might be it. Thank you for the information!
---
Hope that it will be fixed one day, eventho I don't that will happen any time soon.
---
Plank grew up so fast.
---
This is why I stopped doing stuff like this. I liked to have one vendor set up with lots of really good nonperishable food and drink, a six pack of every flavor of cola, and a bunch of free purified water. Inevitably a 200+ player comes by and swipes all the free or 1 cap stuff and bails.
---
Just now witnessed someone 300+ kill a level 60 on my public team after Scorched Earth, took all his junk, then sat around shooting at everyone with a legacy laser.
---
It's really not that hard to be better than this, but some people just lack consideration. Being a douche isn't a playstyle, it's a choice.
---
For me, most of the vendors near Wayward are mid level players who sell completely random stuff. Only once have I seen a higher level player go out of their way to sell uncommon useful stuff like screws and springs for 1-2 caps each.
---
You may have the demand, but you are in no position to be *making* them..
---
It's simple, don't be greedy, everyone has access to good weapons, but people become obsessed with having the absolute best
---
Those who put in the extra effort should have things that others don't, admittedly I wish they would remove legacy items from the game all together
---
If people want the best, they should put the effort in, not get the best items in the game for next to nothing
---
I run Anti Armour Stealth Commando, is it the best? No. But it's pretty damn great and I can solo the queen.
---
There no reason every single person should have every god tier item
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying, but I also want to acknowledge that weapons that were considered mid tier have are quickly becoming obsolete for individuals above 50. I mean, if you‚Äôre going to flood the market with high tier weapons, who would want to trade lower.
---
Thanks.  It just gets annoying when you're trying to sell something and all you do is pull out your gun on the bot
---
Except for the fact that I have personally reached out to Bethesda support for every single problem I have with detailed explanations on how I encounter these bugs and glitches.
---
They respond usually 5 days later and give the stereotypical ‚Äújust turn it off and turn it back on again‚Äù response even when I‚Äôm reporting a bug or a player or whatever. 
---
Eventually I get a generic response that has been copy and pasted. I know this because I have been getting the same template every single time. Their automated response does little to assure me that my feedback is even being heard
---
yep.  2 - 3x xp for player kills, and .2 - .3x xp for time lasted.
---
Boost up xp for survival to final 10 players as well.
---
Ah no wonder my main characters budget is always full...I display all the magazines I get and the bobble heads...
---
That would be amazing:
---
I would name mine 'Ultimate Badass' and just make it so that it is pinging my current location.
---
Alternatively, I can have it pinging my CAMP saying 'best deals in the wasteland'
---
if shes giving you wooden armor and harpoon guns, I'm not sure she loves you that much
---
This aint Fortnite dude !
---
Sorry, couldnt resist :p
---
How do I upvote this twice?
---
Still better than last week when I was at a workshop spot just farming junk and a guy started to claim it, and proceeded to blast me because I was there. Wasn't even trying to take the workshop and would have left if given the chance, didnt help he was over 300 and I was 24.
---
honestly its worth it. Not only does it give you a train but it also gives you a new vendor bot that sings and dances.
---
I read somewhere (when i was building my junkie build) that the cooked radfrogs eggs have a chance of removing an addiction? You can also try the vendors in Whitespring. They are 5 in there that you can look in their Aid Section. Maybe they have addictol for sale.
---
I 100% agree that the game needs a total rework and the developers really need to get it together. I‚Äôm just not sure removing progress from player helps anyone. Dupers will still dupe and get all new stuff. While the average player is left to start over or walk away completely. I am assuming Bethesda has tools to track player progress. I would rather they take the game offline for a few weeks. Maybe bring in help from the community. Im sure some of the fallout 4 mod developers would jump at the chance to help in exchange for the experience. Work out the bugs and relaunch the game after letting people test it on the Pts. 
---
Then once thats done start handing out bans. Anyone thats duped in lets say the last six month gets their account deleted.
---
I started in September of 2019, and things have improved although buggy.  I thought I'd never go FO1st, but tried it for a month and bought a year.   May not go beyond a year as you can always pull from the unlimited junk. I do like the private world too but play much more public now with public teams. I like the game and the subscription helps continue development as I will never buy an atom.  
---
Stash, script, gold and cap limits are frustrating.   Supposedly it prevents excessive grinding.  FO1st may have been planned all along as buying atoms probably didn't make much money.  That only lifts junk limits and after other limits are hit, then why play?  That is definitely not understood.  
---
I suspect having more points in all special slots may be too powerful.  It's definitely frustrating building cards that are bugged and not working.  Currently, action boy/girl, adrenaline, and I believe gun-fu among others are not working.  I have to test gun-fu more.  Did AWOL event earlier and was hitting the same exact damage on multiple gusty bots.
---
Don't really mind scarce items, but scrapper should yield screws and other items required to build and repair.  Ballistic fiber also comes to mind.  It can come from tape and bags but not the armor that contains it?  Fasnatch put a hugh dent in acid collection (but I d o have FO1st).
---
Another thing that is frustrating is that you can't sell floater grenades and maybe some others.  Not sure what new content items can't be sold.  Would people not run the missions anyway?
---
Don't understand the comment on the high level reddit crawling.  I have a level 49, 104, and 231 and still come here to research either something I don't want to figure out on my own.  Many post PSAs or what bugs are happening.
---
but.... she gives me wood.....
---
We can send messages?  
---
I've just been emoting and jumping and crouching.
---
and a harpoon gun to pierce it
---
I do far more damage with my gatling gun, and faster.
---
Just because you dont see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen... this is merely generalizing from your own limited data/opinion... 
---
And until a complete list with data on all items pop up when you tag a camp you will never be satisfied...
---
I honestly believe some characters are biased towards certain effects. For  instance, my beta character NEVER finds bloodied weapons, it‚Äôs always junkies and Ghoul Slayers. But my commando character is the exact opposite. I‚Äôm constantly getting bloodied weapons.
---
1 question. prince Albert or Jacob's ladder
---
The basement that the Vox daily starts/finishes in has one that spawns on the table in there.
---
Additionally, Radscorpion Egg Omelettes will cure a random addicition you have. If you see Radscorpions, kill and loot their eggs, then cook the eggs and eat it. Addiction fixed.
---
I wish Fallout 76 could be a game I put 20-30 hours in, and remember it for the rest of my life, and leave it at that.
---
Not over 400 hours, and slowly getting bitter towards the game and hating the way it was designed.
---
I understand that it's a MMO-ish kinda game, but it's just too much.
---
Sorry you don't like it but there's a good portion of people who like, and prefer, it. 
---
If you don't like it and really want to finish the season just grind out regular adventure. No one is making you do them. 
---
It's an option for score just like the repeatable.
---
If you don't like it don't play it you crybaby.
---
Radscorpion Egg Omelette cures random addiction.
---
Were you using an Ultracite Plasma Caster?
---
Sadly, I have had this same thing happen to me. On a couple of occasions, I have put level 10 customized leather armor as well as a lvl 10 customized bolt pistol for free on my vending machine. It has always been a lvl 100+ who cleaned me out. So, I stopped doing it. At least I don't have to dedicate the 15 pound stash space anymore.
---
Arms for the 'poor'
---
I rolled a bloodied railway rifle on my second ever roll the other day. I was told that I was really lucky, but I swapped it for a junkies one anyway
---
They could fuck up a wet dream.
---
It got hot fixed like an hour ago which is shocking for Bethesda
---
A primed plasma caster?
---
It is like another vault just opened up...
---
lol! Thanks! i wasn't remember it properly. Only the egg part hehe.
---
One man QoL another man nightmare.
---
For example I am very disappointed over hunger and thirst meters getting, well, kinda irrelevant. I am running speed demon and I have never had problem with hunger / thirst. So I do not understand why to change this.  
---
Long story short / TL:DR  
---
The game is trying to mix / was trying to mix pve/ pvp and survival.  
---
Some players do not like that, some do not like this .. and here we go ... :D
---
Ya drives me nuts, now If it was the curb your enthusiasm little ditty then I would have no complaints.
---
Your last comment seems to have disappeared
---
All my plans range from 10-25 each and jetpack plans at 250
---
Nice. Be careful though. Dr. Zorbo is a sore loser and will sabotage your S.C.O.R.E. with the Auto-Complete bug!
---
https://i.imgur.com/BNp0ig5.jpg
---
That's good
---
I don't think you'll manage to. Even hitting her face with 25k damage melee is about 4 swings and i don't think you can reach that with a gun,because guns buff don't stack as much as melee.
---
You got Rad---- Egg, just frog instead of scorpion
---
Wow, it sounds like horrible monster screeches to me.  What differences in perception!
---
Shame, I was looking forward to trying this game out. Lots of games that are put onto Xbox Game Pass for PC arrive broken, and they don't get fixed. I'm hoping that this doesn't end up as just another game trashed by their broken launcher.
---
LOL!
---
just random number from the sky.
---
Hmm that's odd. My internet isn't a problem, that's the thing as well. So really not sure what's going on.
---
Other then the train yard idk. And they don't spawn every time either. Three times in a row I've spawned there and no radscorps.
---
&gt;because someone killed all the ghouls.
---
Mind you that the turrets and NPCs themselves will attack and kill the ghouls if they can. It's not just player that will try to kill the ghouls.
---
Why not go one step further and let us put down permanent mapmarkers with names ?
---
Yeah. Bethesda did this live and then from what my friends and I assume were checking inventories because our pip boys and vendors were messing up
---
No, but I don't use a primed gatling gun either.
---
thread is borked
---
You pretty much have to bend over backwards to make your point, but to be fair it's going to be like that in any sub when you're ranting about the very thing the sub is for.
---
I think you can still drive a point home though, there was a lot of anger about the legendary perk stuff today alone.
---
I know personally when I'm upset my emotions show up in my complaints, and I've gotten a much better response by waiting a day, listing everything very clinically, and using that good ol' managerial technique called a compliment sandwich. Bookend the thing with positivity, what you love about it, then people might look at it more objectively.
---
How about they fix their shitty ass game instead of banning people for the mistakes the developers and QA employees make ? lol
---
Fair enough
---
PITCHFORKS AND TORCHES ! GET YOUR FRSH PITCHFORKS AND TORCHES HERE ! 
---
DONT BE UNPREPARED WHEN THE NEXT RAGING MOB IS RAMPAGING THROUGH ! GET YOUR NEW PITCHFORK AND TORCH ! RIGHT NOW ! RIGHT HERE !
---
When you Prime the Gatling gun it loses the extra fire rate and gains extra damage but the Plasma Caster just gets the extra damage so it ends up doing more overall.
---
Why don't you smartasses say how it is then?
---
True but that‚Äôs only really fixers that have been duped. Not shotguns or heavys. And what mid tier fixers are affected? If u prefer furious or quad they‚Äôve not been duped in huge numbers. Just the blooded. And even now with the size of the player base and the percentage that don‚Äôt use the trade forums bloodied fixers will aim till retain a high value in a few weeks time. Assuming they plug the glitch
---
I'm relatively new to fallout 76 I bought this game during the steam sale and I have to say I absolutely love it. I've been a massive fallout fan since fallout 2 and honestly this game nails that sense of exploration and rekindled my love of the franchise. But I do have to say the only two things I'm kinda unhappy about are the atom shop and the battle pass. The rewards are really freaking cool but honestly the softcap on how much score you can earn kinda sucks I understand it but like to be perfectly fair I don't like battle royales so when it asks me to do nuclear winter it's just a bit of score I'm missing out on. Other than the non adventure challenges though it's actually a really good first battle pass for this game.
---
I had the same thought, and I'm sure it would fix it.
---
2 accounts. 1 with my main 104 character, my beta character and another rando. The other acount has my food mule and my ammo, weapon, etc mule.
---
Are u on ps4 I think I fought it with u
---
No roll back.  I don't even sell stuff.  Glad some like selling.  I did benefit from buying serums sooner that I would have, but I don't understand the rush to have more caps to buy more stuff to then sell more stuff.  Making extra stuff to sell more stuff doesn't really hurt my game economy.
---
It broke my heart listening to the Colonel's first holotape when he was a little boy missing his dad after the bombings.
---
They‚Äôre never gonna get their shit straight with people still buying shit from the atom store
---
yeah idk why everyone isn‚Äôt doing this lol
---
My camp is at a double resource spot wich makes the high traffic.... we need more double resource camps or none at all
---
I‚Äôd say handmades too, as well as laser rifles and laser/plasma gatlings. The only things untouched are the weapons that go relatively unused in the meta.
---
I don't understand why! I'm a lvl 227 and I don't even consider emptying someone's vendor of low level stuff. I don't need them, not even the junk I'd get from scrapping them. I don't even need stable flux so I don't understand the point of killing someone for them or snatching someone's loot after they did. If I want to spend my caps I'd rather pay for some nice legendary. 
---
Someone care to explain why someone does this, I'd like to understand!
---
That's dumb. Thank you for confirming though. Appreciated.
---
Best in slot - basically the best item for that particular area.
---
Best in slot.
---
"Best in Slot"
---
it means its the best of the best gear
---
What‚Äôs you‚Äôre build?
---
I seriously thought you were going for some kind of x items sold record... But I support your suggestion.
---
Same goes to the lockpick one. Good luck finding 3 locked chest while everyone tries to kill you. I don't understand the point of making adventure mode challenges in NW, if they force them, at least make them mode appropriate.
---
This!
---
‚ÄúAre you sure you want ME? A heavily armed *charging gauss rifle*, and armored *bangs fist on their own power armor making a thud*, fcking WARMACHINE to help your friends?‚Äù
---
At some point,precisely between lvl 1000 and 1500,levelling up will be this  big of an effort that not even unyielding buffed would be enough to keep up. It would mean levelling up once a week or more without double xp.  Can you imagine getting a perk pack once every 5 weeks(to get only 4 points)?
---
That's when god mode will become mandatory to keep enjoying the game....a glitch needed to enjoy the "content",can you imagine that?
---
This game has also a mobile'esque grind with the SCORE.
---
At first everthing is easy but it goes slower from rank to rank like tractor pulling.
---
But then you are able to buy SCORE with atoms, what a relief!
---
Also nearly every bug that was marked as patched is still in the game.
---
I too had fun for 500h in 3 months (started with Waste-oftime-landers), but the lack on communication and reaction (hotfixes) is just mindnumbling. 
---
This game is centered around the atom shop.
---
I love the game. And I have never seen so many fucking bugs and glitches.
---
Even with every other game I've played combined, it's not half as many as I've seen in about 50 hours of this game. I'm running out of controllers to throw. 
---
Currently rebuilding my first actual attempt at making a real camp, because after 4 hours of working on it, I tried to move it to my final location, and, "Can't place item, needs support" was Bethesda's way of thanking me for making the only game I've ever paid full price for one of theirs.
---
But again, love the game. Sadly.
---
Same here I have so many learned that I‚Äôm barely finding any that I don‚Äôt know
---
Bethesda is a business first. We can sit and pretend it's like the good ol underdog days but you just need to have a look at Zenimax board memebrs to understand their priority. They keep the players fed and happy just enough to yield as much as they can from us and the system.
---
Flatwoods kitchens locked fridge is another horrifying one.
---
Are you on Xbox if so could you maybe help me build one aka I‚Äôll provide mats cause I suck at building
---
if its legendary, its scrip and people will buy it its capitalism dude.
---
if you want to help noobs, go out and do it one by one. 
---
unless you plaster "FOR LOW LEVELS ONLY" people arent necessary going to get what you are doing. people vendor hop and dont really pay attention beyond that.
---
Did they ever fix the bug it had with Barbarian/Evasion?
---
I sometimes take breaks as the grinding gets monotonous.  The Legendary Run changed the monotonous grinding for me (Wastelanders did too with new missions).
---
It doesn't matter if you're Rambo, a headband does not make you look cool or even remotely good.
---
Gee I hope we‚Äôre not following the ‚ÄúMole miners are kids‚Äù theory.
---
The universe can only expand so fast, so eventually we're gonna end up going full circle. That means you better pick up the pace there lads
---
Heh, first time I did it my friends and I got scared as shit and just fought our hearts out, Is recommend getting on the top of something to avoid its glowing wendigo horde, it‚Äôs amazing for screws and is a lot of fun but you need good guns and a LOT of ammo to do it.
---
It would‚Äôve been understandable if those are legendary, but nope, just stuffs straight out of workbench.
---
I just tried the skin on the sentry and eyebot helmets. It changes them both to the same skin, so any of the bot helms will work it seems.
---
You think that‚Äôs gonna stop me
---
Shut up dad
---
Perfectly worded. most people have many characters at level 100 or even 200,thinking they did a lot ,but all those 5 lvl 200 characters combined have less xp than a single lvl 650.
---
Two-kick Rip from Stable 87, your bullet in the head waits for you...
---
No, if it‚Äôs built at the WS it stays at the WS and vice versa.
---
This! \^
---
I‚Äôve had a similar experience with Unyeilding armor (before and after using SS armor). Also, my best weapons rolls happened to be bloodied (B 40PA 1s sledgehammerx2, B 40PA 1S Death Tambo) and those dropped from legendary enemies.
---
I'm stuck at the door. The ID card refuses to read for me.
---
I've went back to his hideout, waited a week, quadruple cleared roboco, the works. 
---
I've come to terms with not finishing that quest. It's broken as hell.
---
I was server hopping looking for outfits from vendor that sometimes spawns near anchor farm. found her. did dialogue and option to accommodate at camp came up. Her ally build was guitar and chair.
---
30hrs Really? I regretfully best the main quest and the side ones in around 10-12. Now I‚Äôm bored and have nothing more to do like usual.
---
I‚Äôve been crafting level 20 and 30 fixers for all the low level players so they have something good to use soon. I actually got a 3* junkies handmade drop and I was so stoked until I realized it was level 25ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just dropped it for a level 20 so they‚Äôd have a good day lol. I love dropping gear and aid for new players, it‚Äôs my new favorite part of the game
---
Yep and you got the kiosks and displays that take up both storage *and* budget as you utilize them. It‚Äôs almost as though looting, collecting, and building is somehow discouraged.
---
You can like it. I like it. People like to throw fits.
---
eh might be thinking they were being nice by giving you caps. ive done that before.
---
also buying to scrap from mods. level 590 and im still missing mods for most armor slots.
---
Could I take you up on the offer of some help? Kinda new to the game and I need somebody to revive for the Pioneer Scouts questline.
---
I'm on PC, timezone BST, username MammothMachine
---
An aae what. Also trading is not allowed here, so you might get taken down
---
It's the looting compulsion that has been enabled by previous titles. If it can be picked up or obtained, it should be. When storage space is infinite they can't help but pick up stuff.
---
Scrip it.
---
Yes! I made the guy who got killed party leader, not really even sure why, I just felt bad after he got killed but knew I was no match for that bloodied legacy weapon. Then he kicked you? I was glad after he left you were able to rejoin. I think he assumed you took his stuff.
---
That fight was *nuts*.
---
In our country it is  
---
BiS - Bezpeƒçnostnƒõ - Informaƒçn√≠ - Slu≈æba  
---
just to enhance your knowledge :D
---
Dude. This was a great help. Thankyou
---
I sold a lvl 5 combat knife in my vendor for 30k yesterday, yes I'm somewhat of a buisness manüòé
---
Got mine plans from Vendor bot Wallace in Harpers Ferry
---
Man I just skipped that one. Seems like a pita
---
That‚Äôs a bit to risky for me tbh
---
That brings back memories
---
Yeah, 9 is way too much. 3 is doable.
---
Laser and plasma gats outside of legacy won‚Äôt really be affected. I mean. Who was using them anyway lol. Not sure if some melee has been done. Seen a few bear arms ss s but that‚Äôs about it. Mainly the legacy market and 2525 fixers. To be fair I got a 2525 and, for me, it‚Äôs not as good as the 5025 I already had. I‚Äôm a bit disappointed
---
Just drop your gifts in an overseer's chest, then you won't get pissed when players act like real-life people.
---
Yea when he attacked u I was there trying to back u but I didn't want none either I'm glad u didn't engage lol add me my psn the same as my name on here
---
I think a lot of higher level players are d'bags. Think about it. Why would you feel the need to be in a server for more than hour and not take over any workshops but as soon as a lower player level takes it over, you have the urge to go and ruin it because you've got your stealth armour which for some reason worked even while running around fast. He took over the workshop and left the server 5mins later ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§Ø
---
This bug is still alive and kicking, and not just for the bow.
---
Make a new character, immediately head to Wayward to hit level 3. Delete and recreate character as needed.
---
You can also do the daily NW challenge if it isn't too demanding.
---
I honestly don't understand the gripe on the new challenge objectives as they are far more easier and less time consuming than the previous ones. However, my complaint is the dramatic loss in Atom earning potential (it was always Beth's plan to do this) and the fact that I still need to be married to the game to earn enough SCORE (fuck typing each period and yes, this took longer to type but the effort isn't as mind-numbing) to keep a steady progress throughout the season.
---
Just hopped off after doing mine, if it‚Äôs in Morgantown I‚Äôll spawn in next to the gas station by the high school then make my way to VTU where I‚Äôll get 3-4 creatures (mostly ghouls), then I‚Äôd quit and do it again.
---
Well done, it looks awesome!
---
My interests are definitely plans and pictures. I didn't even do most of the main questlines for the first month or so because I was having fun doing my own thing. Then I realized that some plans and locations are only available when you follow the quests, so now I'm doing some. 
---
I also play NW at least once a day. I'm not good at it, but it's exciting. Plus a teammate gave me all of the nuke codes and a briefcase, and talked me through using it.
---
And I know that people complain about bugs, but I think they are a fun feature. Like coming across a full suit of power armor floating 6' off the ground. Or in NW when a teammate intersected with a trash can and started dragging it along with her. It made a racket and we were murdered right away, but it was hilarious.
---
Need more perks to upgrade those legendaries? That'll be 1500 atoms per pack!
---
Same No Region Ping [1.5.1] problem, also a notice saying 'we are trying to get servers back online'.
---
The only gold item I'm going for is the gauntlet, and that's just one character. The others are working for compound bow plans. Everything else is really "meh." This game is easy, and some extra-powerful armor or a gun that's hard to feed isn't going to tip the scales for me.
---
Oh really, thanks man
---
"First Blood": We realized that Bloodied was greatly outdamaging every other effect and it was upsetting the community. As a result we've added this Legendary Perk where at full health you deal 100% bonus damage, but every time you attack you lose 10% of your health.
---
"What the Flux": Want to slaughter those Scorchbeast Queens and Wendigo Colossi faster with more Ultracite ammo? Every time you gather any colored Flux you have a chance to also gather some extra Yellowcake Flux!
---
"Inert Explosives": Hate it when hitting 8+ enemies with your Auto Grenade Launcher causes it to break after 10 shots? Increase the durability of all explosive launchers by 100% and reduce the explosion radius so you can only hit 2 enemies at a time.
---
What makes this worse is that after 1000 it takes like 113,000 XP to level up ONCE lmao
---
I've always wondered what it is, it's crazy good
---
Yeah, damn man thanks
---
He moves a space a day, you should move roughly 1-3 per day depending on your ranking as I move 2 per day and by then I should catch up by the third or fourth week
---
Ah .. well heck it gets so infuriating in terms of ammo wasted
---
What's the first rule of fight club?
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Although I've been unable to install just gives me error on MS store..
---
I have a few
---
Gat plas?
---
The first time I saw one, it one shotted me and despawned.
---
The second time, I was smarter. Attacking while it was stuck, leading it towards others. There server bugged, with it looking like everyone was AFK, despite the sound of a guass minigun. I led it torwards Watoga, with the beast getting stuck in a trench along they way. An hour past, 20 fusions spent and 2 Scorchbeasts eradicated and the Colossus finally exploded from bloody mess.
---
Keep in mind I was using a 1 star Ultracite gatling laser and really did not want to die and lose the Colossus.
---
Many of us are looking for suggestions.  I am solo, dont run stranger in numbers on a regular basis.  Only can share a 1*, so what are recommendations?
---
What's the question?
---
Trying to grind the challenges except the XP. I missed two challenges last week though. I use building teams, play NW, do all the dailies and weeklies. I'm at rank/level 25. It looks like I'm a bit behind compared to everyone. I need to grind some of the XP ones I guess.
---
im at 630 and its about 95-100k per level for me it seems.
---
It‚Äôs ur NW perks
---
I faced this same dilemma and left four fully equipped suits at a train station. Maybe someone got lucky.
---
Oh i see. Aight thanks man
---
Closest we've got to a headband in-game at the moment is the grognak leather band atom shop item
---
U need to walking around n good luck, I would recommend u to skip it if u r not interested in playing NW
---
I spent almost 1 hour to complete this, not worth at all
---
I do just that; keep one set of each to have a collection. I only use the T-65 on a daily basis, and excavator for the rare occasions when I mine ore.
---
Why are you getting downvoted your right
---
Not possible without god mode
---
I just do event and help out low level player, I also occasionally do nuke runs to help out low level players do it for the first time, it‚Äôs amazing getting to meet different people.
---
I just do events for fun and help out low level player, I also occasionally do nuke runs to help out low level players do it for the first time, it‚Äôs amazing getting to meet different people.
---
Exactamundo! I pretty much join every time I see it active, and - more often than not - no one else joins ... so I activate the feeders and head straight for the karp. Gather as much as I can, and it is the only one of the three that doesn‚Äôt self-delete from your inventory after the event, and weighs 0 each. That way, when I see some folks taking the event seriously, I just dump the whole 60 and head to the radstags / molerats.. it‚Äôs free real estate!
---
He means *fix*, as in; Break the game in a purposeful manner in a transparent attempt to get players to spend real money on crappy cosmetics.
---
They certainly have been fixing it.
---
I've been killed by my Guass Shotgun Multiple times. Usually when a Charred goul jumps at me as I'm firing a full charge. Insta death.
---
I keep all sets in the hope for display cases/stations, losing hope now though....
---
I tried Pistol build for my latest character. In agility I run 1 point Action Boy (use AP armor and Luck perk Grim reapers sprint to make up difference, I never run out of AP), 9 points Pistols, 2 points sneak (use all shadowed armor plus 1 piece of sneak armor), 1 point escape artist (negates all armor noise), 1 point Gun fu, 1 point Adrenaline.
---
-But-
---
Then I decided to make it a double dip pipe Revolver build. I don't know if you are aware, but pipe revolvers and pipe bolt actions, if equipped with a stock, will use both Rifle and Pistol perks at the same time. So that's where you get armor piercing (3 points tank killer) plus 9 points rifle damage.
---
Gun has 6 shot chamber, fast reload, never get detected in stealth. Its a really fun build and does huge damage. People think I'm just a scrub with a Pipe Revolver until I start 1 shotting everything haha..
---
Not to sound like a Debbie downer. But it's in fact 150 scrip not 200. I know. I'm such a cunt.
---
Oh? Didnt know people could be the CIA in fallout now
---
Mmm not really, if you could take the duped items from pc into Xbox/PS it would be a shitshow.
---
I honestly feel that all the people who advocate no legendaries but don't also advocate to nerf nuka spam and healing in general haven't spent any meaningful amount if time pvping in this game. 
---
Healing is amazingly op and removing legendaries without addressing that just means immortal, unkillable players. Not a formula for fun pvp.
---
I doubt anyone is duping them, their value went very low after the month of wastelande
---
You really only need an Excavator and one other.
---
Only relevant to the orginal question. Magazines, because they are hella useful, and not duped to hell. After that berry mentats because of they're xp buff.
---
Buy it for caps each day. Can earn it through season rewards.
---
I've come across a lot of people trying to share 1 point in it. I share 3, so that's another 10% xp.
---
U can get it through levelling in Legendary Run, but it‚Äôs not realistic n the gold given is pathetic
---
So no, u can only get 200 per day and 1700 per week, 300 from Smiley in Wayward
---
I only really keep three in my box. My excavator, my full customized T-60 and my x-01. I suppose you could keep them because I‚Äôm sure at somepoint they will put out a power armor display stand. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if its when we get the brotherhood of steel dlc.
---
I wish that were true, maybe I wouldn't be spending half my time in a queue.
---
Smiley?
---
Seems the same to me. Likely, people hunt them more frequently as Scorchbeast Brain gives +3 INT for 30 minutes and helps considerably towards the S.C.O.R.E. grind.
---
Does she registered Bethesda Account already? Connection Error got multiple code, u may search the relative code online
---
You don't need them if you don't use them
---
Yes but if all the turrets are broken the NPCs don't really do enough damage to get themselves swarmed easily they might kill 1 or 2. Not 6 or 7. 
---
And certainly not in 15 seconds or so.
---
I was at wellspring and I saw a player camp marker at a house that‚Äôs just a normal in game house. It had a pony ride. I sat in the pony ride and when I got off I was murdered and couldn‚Äôt retrieve my scrap. Fun times.
---
You can only buy so much gold a week, if you buy the 300 all at once that's it
---
No, that's what I was saying.
---
To change the name login to the Bethesda site and change displayed name. Level on the player card is static. It shows the level you were when you made the picture.
---
Even if there were more double resource spots, you'd just have more high traffic areas lol
---
I would say prioritize a pretty and unique location over whatever resources it has, the resource miners are a rather slow way to stock up
---
The username used ur account name instead of character name when it display, the level 1 player card on loading screen is actually the photo u taken with photomode in the beginning, u can take another photo with it using Vault Frame, try it urself n HF
---
Fair point. Will delete
---
They should add plans to craft a full magazine rack. Converting it to a single item would help the server and reduce stash / budget consumption
---
Hacking?
---
I see alot of y'all complaining about budget. Perhaps try using pre existing locations to save on budget.
---
The crossbow can hold 3 bolts and can be fired in quick succession. If they are firing more shots or firing fast with regular bows then they are cheating.
---
Go up to the second floor in the Wayward. After doing the Wayward questline and the Wastelanders questline a guy will appear there and sell you up to 300 bullion per week.
---
Wait it‚Äôs a She?
---
Is there a list of most valuable stuff? I was always curious what made the top 10. Weapons, Armor and outfits.
---
How...
---
I‚Äôve played the game since launch almost every other day for hours and I‚Äôm only level 140 how am I supposed to get level 1600? üò≠
---
What bugs me is that Bethesda knows how to make unlimited stash storage. They do for FO1st members with junk storage, so they should be able to with everything else, but they don‚Äôt.
---
Guiding meditation gives 3 or 4 of them for completing the event. If you are on xbox I have some extra.
---
crossbow.
---
maybe also the magazine overstuff bug.
---
I used to take damage until I maxed admantium and fireproof and for the last few weeks I wasn't taking damage.  I must've changed something
---
I normally spawn where there are 10 none there but I had a friend join me and they helped me get it fortunately.
---
You spawn on your camp greed (green one) straight to the north from your C.A.M.P. device +- some obstacles. So position your C.A.M.P. device in a way that a flat space is to the north from it.
---
Unyielding on Solar is not ideal since they do not synergize well. Unless you are dying for a Unyielding piece then scrip it and reroll.
---
i hope we get persistent workshops, so that we can make s larger settlement in our private worlds. then it wont matter as much about camp budgets, because you will have so much more to be creative with.
---
That challenge helped me enjoy my NW dailies a little more, actually. Now that I know where a couple of safes are, I like trying to start my plays with them.
---
Thanks my friends :)
---
1st dun use VATS, it doesn‚Äôt deal dmg to the player, equip the relative perks of ur weapon along with fireproof to minimise explosive dmg, life giver give u extra HP, cola nuts is must because one of the essence in PvP is nuka cola, if u get a couple of Stealthboy it‚Äôs better.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Exactly my thoughts.   I'm level 250 on my main, 1700 hours.   I could accept SCORE.   But the new legendary perks....   they are made to be impossible.   I counted the cards I could trash for perk coins.   Only about 170.   So at level 250, I can level up exactly one rank on one of these cards?   The cards that I've coalesced into two- or three-star cards still only garner one coin?   What is the point?   (I have a second character in the 100's somewhere, but since these things don't share across characters, I couldn't care less about that character's cards.   I'd be surprised if she has 100 spare cards.)   I hope someone tells me I don't understand how cashing in cards works, because if my understanding is correct....  ugh.  
---
I'm still putting in a number of hours per day, waiting for new content to drop.   But this latest news on the legendary perks is pretty demotivating.  Thinking maybe I should play Outer Worlds, read some books, whatever.
---
I absolutely love it when people drop nukes on random locations. In the entire time I've been playing it's been incredibly rare to see any outside of the major hotspots, and even more rare when it turns out that it wasn't to nuke somebody's camp =P
---
Thats what I thought at first but he was for sure holding a bow and crossbow shots don‚Äôt explode
---
Vats dont work in PvP, but is a bug or its a Nerf?
---
I‚Äôm a wanderer I just roam around the map killing stuff I find it quite fun trying to find glowing or legendary enemies for fun
---
Graham the traveling super mutant merchant has them i think. But hes a pain to find. 
---
Are you on pc?  I may have a spare you can have but can‚Äôt check to see until tomorrow. if I don‚Äôt have a spare i can escort you to vendor bot wallace and see if he has it. Free of charge. You can even tag some of the enemies Before i kill then.
---
Yeah.. I¬¥ll be around 250 when it comes out.. So 5 Cards... for free... ammo / Infitrator / 3 Specials.. Sounds ok for me.. Then clean up on perk cards i dont need.. that get me a level 2... I won\`t be grinding this, as I won\`t be grinding any more seasons.. I do this one purely to figure where I can get with playing way more than usual.
---
I go back to weekend casual and f.. that grind.. Cyberpunk ist not far.. that might be the gb to fo76 for al loooooooooooong time. And honestly.. I love the map and the world.. I love the community, but bethesda can go to \*fill in nasty place\*. I do not care anymore btw.. Daggerfall was my first Bethesda game and the route they are going with their games.. fo76 might have been my last.
---
Yeah the caps are a bit too low. 5k caps &amp; 500 scrips would be perfect
---
My kinda orgy!
---
Was that on ps4? I sold one for that price wich i kinda regret now.. i was New and i didnt want to use the OP bloodied/heavy weapons build. Couldve made a lot more caps i guess
---
But make sure to get it fast. You have to buy between the Saturday reset and the atom shop reset the next Tuesday or he acts like you already bought from him
---
Nothing Bethesda have made has *ever* "just worked"
---
Saw a guy with a lever action shooting it like a machine guns. Pretty sure it's just a hacked.
---
I think the bad start filtered out all the toxic players
---
There's also a drink. Ballistic block I think it's called.
---
So random guy dropped 60 stims, 60 pf, and 60 Radaway for me. It was pretty nice because I just started playing yesterday.
---
It can't be 1500/levels to max out one
---
I swear I hear "you again" when I show up. We have a distasteful relationship, her and I. I stroll along and cash in my hard earned Nocturnals for some of her ludicrously scam-like currency, give it to her for something I can use, and in return she gives me a new Nocturnal only this one is worse than I traded in in the first place. She laughs, I take aim and shoot a few rounds into her head, we both say our goodbyes and I head back out while she prepares to scam the next poor cunt who walks in the door. 
---
Maybe that's all she needs though. A good shag and perhaps she'll lighten up and start being a bit nicer with her customers. Have at it my friend!
---
Yeah, it's absurd. It's even more absurd if you look at it in the context of this idiotic system. There is no legit way to get to level 1500+ in ANY reasonable amount of time.
---
I noticed this the other day after playing for the first time a week or so ago. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me, haha
---
It‚Äôs intentional nerf maybe
---
That‚Äôs probably not a result of duping, those are easy to farm the legit way once you‚Äôre a high enough level
---
Can anyone?   Without a glitch, I mean.
---
Throw out all your notes and holotapes and junk you don‚Äôt need if you are hoarding. Having tons of crap like that will make you lag while going into stash or other stuff and you will have longer loading times.
---
Wouldn't expect them to. Game pass games are terrible for modding.
---
It's been fine on PS4.
---
This game is becoming way too much work, I legit don‚Äôt have the time for fallout 76 anymore with the direction all of these updates are heading.
---
Have you got the prerequisites like sfe for the mods?
---
I‚Äôm on pc just fixed my post. And on console the games fine as I just tested it on my Xbox and Ps4 it only on my pc
---
yes.
---
Do you remember where it‚Äôs found?
---
I‚Äôm on a new character mate I literally have nothing :/ the issue is still there even dropped and tossed a bunch of legendary, Holos etc.
---
Do i login through f76,steam, or browser?
---
It‚Äôs all RNG, I get my last 6 kill in a single match lasts 20 min
---
Have you been able to fix it ? I hate playing on window mode not gonna continue to play if this keeps going on. Even on my brothers pc it‚Äôs doing the same thing which is odd
---
Is it just weapons being duped this time or other stuff as well?
---
Im finally starting to accumulate some usually valuable items for my vending machine. If the market gets shat on again Im gonna be pretty cranky
---
Scrap storage isn't the same as rendering each object in the world, not even remotely close.
---
It‚Äôs a stupid system. Case in point:
---
Back when the monocle was on the shop (could‚Äôve been right after launch tbh) I didn‚Äôt bother with it because I felt it didn‚Äôt fit the wasteland aesthetic - even when they did eventually vault it I had the same opinion and passed up on it.
---
Fast forward to today and I‚Äôd probably fork out 5$ for it if I could, because I need it on my ally overlooking my sophisticated hunting club CAMP.
---
But I can‚Äôt. I literally cannot give them the revenue they want, because they thought artificially shortening supply to play mindgames is such a good idea...
---
Cool stuff. Can wallpaper be added inside the train? Or can you atleast put walls up?
---
True, I guess it would be different
---
Neither of the mods he listed require SFE. Not that I expect SFE to run with that version of the game, even with the checkbox for mods enabled, the files are still locked down.
---
The only person I'm simping for.
---
Totally! I also want the VTU rewards to be glitched ...
---
Same bro, she‚Äôs a bit big though ain‚Äôt she?
---
most players derp out on any Events that require any sort of "advance" mechanics.
---
if you know how to do it, you have to just do it yourself and not bank on anyone else knowing how to do it.
---
Encryptid, Radiation Rumble, are some examples of hilarity when you watch players derping it.
---
Sometimes I just stand there and watch people unload their entire ammo inventory into the invisible Sheepsquatch, and see how long it takes for any of them to catch on
---
Kind gent. The wasteland will miss you.
---
47. I need more than 2000 points for the next rank so just the dailies don't cut it anymore. Also I'm not doing NW.
---
For what's coming, the ranks 90+ require more than 3000 points and I might not be able to muster 300k XP for that (1 level up challenge already requires 110k XP for me at 682).
---
I'm a full health PA build with luck 1 so no mutations, only INT boosts from builder teams and Broiled Scorchbeast Brains, Cranberry Relish and Lover's Embrace. A lvl 68 Super Mutant gives me 282 XP with max team at best.
---
Buy em up while ya can ig. It's all fair game at this point. but NO DUPING EVER! Todd is watching u
---
Hahaha xD. I do the same but for the screenshots.
---
I would love to have the game design director come out and answer a couple of questions.
---
Like, who makes these decisions? It's literally impossible that anyone who actually plays this game is involved in the design process of all of these idiotic caps, time gates and "RNG" for legendaries.
---
I literally do it every day I play, which is almost every day at some point right now, for the Legendary Run. I set up the welcome tents at the start of my session, and if I go back to camp during it, I try and restock.
---
Can you please let me know when you get it? I am also  grinding for the fur-lined jacket. I‚Äôve been playing NW for a few hours every day and haven‚Äôt gotten it yet ... I know it‚Äôs quite a slog but I‚Äôm always worried it‚Äôs been patched already.
---
1.1k hours in. Level 340
---
Last time I checked data, everyone above level 600 used some kind on an exploit or a glitch, and the game has been out for how long? 2 years? So yaay! I'm sure all of you guys can't wait to grind for 5 years to max 1 card out of 10 or whatever it may be.
---
go to player vendors and just buy them. i see so many Bloodied weapons in vendors, that i'm sick of them. cause i'm a stealth build and i've trying to find an Instigating Lever Action forever
---
Yep I drop that daily if I‚Äôm playing lol.
---
If they dont adjust the system to be somewhat useful for people at level 200 I'm not even gonna bother with it. I mean I play this game for almost 400 hours on PC if that isn't worthy of using fully uograded legendary perk cards I dont know what is.... But since it's Bethesda and they even manage to fuck up a season pass I doubt they not gonna fuck this up aswell lol
---
Browser. Use your Bethesda's login and password not Steam's
---
Same ü§£
---
Ok
---
I feel your pain. I'm in the exact same boat.
---
The Ammo converter makes 2mm but the Allied rep grind Raider Ammo Machine does not even tho Raiders, Settlers, &amp; (kina) SS add an endgame 2mm weapon in the Wastelander expansion.
---
Please please please tell me it‚Äôs not being done Via vending machines again, I can‚Äôt go another month without vending machines
---
I share grenadier.. lots of people have explosive weapons but i dont think many run this card.
---
True but we learn about vault 76 in fallout 3 through the terminal in the citadel
---
Bethesda screw their own lore all the time
---
examples:
---
The appalachian FEV experiments
---
Brotherhood/enclave
---
Vault 76
---
The fact that they added additional vaults that were never produced by vault tec
---
And i think there was a few more
---
And from what i remember reading, the brotherhood and enclave split from the american army due to the FEV experiments and the direction each wanted to take regarding americas future
---
I have been having issues since yesterday on PS4 even on my private 1st server. I suspect the  people who are duping weapons and things are messing up the servers
---
I know it shouldn't be done, but realistically this is why people dupe.
---
I gave up and started playing something else. Not particularly helpful, sorry.
---
You on PC? Think I've got a few in my stash
---
Nope. I wont tell you how but let's just say it's with train vendors.
---
Are you on a laptop with switchable graphics or do you have multiple GPUs in your system?If so, this may worth a try: 
---
On the desktop, right click and go Screen Settings. At the bottom, go Graphics settings. Browse for Fallout76.exe and set it to high performance.
---
Lol 1500 levels to max ONE card?
---
its related to NPC vendor bots this time. 
---
not player vendors.
---
Theres a lot of misinformation flying around, including the OP's statement.
---
You get a legendary slot at level 50,75,100,150,200 and 300.
---
When a slot becomes available, you can choose from any of the legendary perks to go in that slot.
---
Legendary perks start at rank 1.
---
So for example, a level 200 player will have 5 rank 1 legendary perks active.
---
You can rank the legendary perks up (gives better bonuses).  Doing this costs "coins". You earn coins by scrapping normal perk cards (e.g. super duper). It costs 100 coins to go to rank 2, a further 150 coins to go to rank 3, and a further 200 coins to go to rank 4.
---
So people number crunched how many levels you would need to not only have 6 legendary perks, but to have all 6 of them maxed at rank 4. The rough estimate was you'd need to be ~ level 1500 to hit this maxed out state.
---
At level 100 you'll have 3 legendary perks. Its only really for completionists that want to have all 6, fully maxed, that the level 1500 applies.
---
The game needs more varity in its grind and less restrictions, rather than more reason to grind. There are plenty of reasons to grind (SS plans, Season rewards, Reputation Rewards) but very little variety and what we do have has daily restrictions
---
imio pvp is kinda bad in this game, if they reintroduce a survival mode they should really rework most of the weapons if not all them, and armor too, like they did with nuclear winter.  
---
Removing it was the best decision, and nuclear winter is way better for pvping than the base game.  
---
by removing legendaries but just keeping the unique weapons (which are basically legendaries) you give more power to people that have them and you'll basically force people to use them if you want to survive, also, the game basically revolves around getting the best legendaries, you'll remove one of the main objectives in the game.  
---
i think that if they want to reintroduce a pvp oriented rpg mode, with survival elements there should be
---
1) everyone starts at level 1, no old characters
---
2) no legendary perks (when they arrive)
---
3)give everyone a meaningfull objective to work for (so that you can remove legendaries and stuff but still have something to work for)
---
When they announced nuclear witer they said they wanted a more quick and easy fallout experience, they should work on that more.
---
what they introduce a new mode where your main objective is to seize control of the three nuclear armaments?
---
It would go like this:
---
\- you start at level 1 at the vault 76
---
\- a short, optional quest line
---
\- the objective is to seize control of the three nuclear silos, and the only way to enter is to find the nuclear key cards
---
\- full on pvp, when you die you drop your loot, some chems and every nuclear keycard you have
---
\- no legendaries
---
\- lgendary monster can still spawn, but they drop the legendary perk cards
---
\- and i you win you get to obtain specail rewards like in nuclear winter, just cosmetics, no special weapons
---
\- and also, the players per match should be more, 48 maybe? or 36 (but i don't think the engine can keep up with that)
---
I think you guys are miss reading this. Clearly they fell out of the top bunk bed.
---
I‚Äôm about to give up if it doesn‚Äôt work tomorrow lol no reason for a expensive pc build to be like this. Back to world of warcraft üòÇ
---
The Colonel's story overall, in addition to the voice acting, is one of my favorite stories in the game. So simple, yet so effective. Legitimately got me to tear up a bit when I first played through Flatwoods.
---
Best Endgame sum up i‚Äòve ever seen.
---
Feels sometimes as they don‚Äôt want you enjoying the game.
---
Im currently sitting on 100+ Treasury Notes which I can only cash in at 20 per day. because like everyone Im grinding events etc like a mofo for SCORE points I keep accumulating more than I am ever probably going to actually be able to redeem. And Im fairly certain what Im holding would make plenty of players laugh at my puny efforts.
---
Because of the above-mentioned grinding I also seem to be accumulating a lot of legendaries. Gets to the point though I cant script them all because Ive used my limit for the day. Cant sell them in my vending machine because a) theyre rubbish usually and b) Stash is full probably. Cant sell them to the bots because Im at my caps limit for the day too. So they get dropped on the ground or i dont even bother looking to get a shot on.
---
Like you I didnt really get it either until I got here too. And the time gating and limits is beyond ridiculous. Doesnt matter how many times it gets complained about it falls on deaf ears. Im still finding enough to do to enjoy the game but I can already tell its going to get old soon. For the most part Im filling in time until Cyberpunk drops
---
Still on gauss weapons too, basically any weapon that "charges" bow is basically a re-skinned gauss rifle as far as I can tell.
---
Is it the no region ping error? Maybe try this that was just posted:
---

---
psychotats + ballistic bock is what I tend to use.
---
Same here even in the private server but it‚Äôs 100x worse in private server as my FPS got to the lowest 8-12!!!! Sucks I can‚Äôt enjoy this game right now been playing since day one. Hopefully it fixes or gets updated ASAP
---
Pretty sure it's not a bug, legendary gear wasn't meant to be affected by this perk. They just forgot to remove sound &amp; popup because you know, Bethesda.
---
I mean after the brotherhood madness, the "evolution" expansion will have us choosing to be a ghoul, super mutant, or some human-hybrid mess depending which Zetan faction we side with. We'll all be reverted stone aged weapons and such when the Zetans give up on apalachia anyway....
---
I tried to register using my steam email and it says that "Your email is in use.If you've played any of our games, you may already have an account." Will it be a problem if i use another email and if yes, how do i register the purchase(fallout 76) i made?
---
Dude, same. The only plans i even sell anymore are weapon, PA, and jetpack plans, everything else i just drop at a low levels camp. And really the plans that i sell, i honestly don‚Äôt care about making caps off of since i have so many. I guess it‚Äôs time to just do away with those too and start dropping off one of each at everyone‚Äôs camp when i do my camp hopping.
---
*may mothman bless him.
---
Sadly it‚Äôs on a different drive then the windows one
---
Yes she does. And we‚Äôve tried and tried all solutions online
---
they could make a box for any stackable item though. ammo, meds ect
---
that would solve most of peoples storage issues.
---
Dang, sadly it‚Äôs on a different drive than the one Windows is on. Hopefully I can find something else
---
Based on all the threads I've read looks like the GamePass version is broken on release. So we get the authentic "FO76 experience" I guess lol.
---
Ya, thats like an instigating minigun or a furious blackpowder rifle. Horrible synergy, just scrip.
---
250? 1,700 hours? Soooo strange, what are you doin my guy? üòÇüòÇ I'm level 240 with 290 hours.
---
I get this occasionally, restarting my PC fixes it every time for me.
---
Im not talking about weapons. Ive legit acquired some rare plans and other things that I want to retain some value.
---
Open a ticket to the Bethesda, it‚Äôs final solution
---
Damn. Was really hoping to dive back into the game. Got it on launch and it was a yawn fest. Heard it‚Äôs actually not half bad now. Guess I‚Äôll just wait for a patch!
---
This is intentional. Super Duper is explicitly disabled from working on gold bullion stuff, so it can trigger but doesn't do anything.
---
just attack the servers with a hammer, results may vary, but at least immediate frustrations will be quelled
---
Have you been to the Alpine River Cabins south of the Vault yet?
---
super duper doesn't proc on crafted module gear, its blocked lol
---
You talking about that 10k XP repeatable? If that so, i have a chance to overcome Zorbo.
---
Agreed, but it'd obviously be behind a pay wall.
---
You're s'posed to make the come here emote when there are enemies that nobody is helping you kill and/or a legendary ;P They can't be everywhere at once...
---
Guess that will be the next thing to be disabled then.
---
Idk. Im sure they will down the road. For now just ride the dupe wave. I'd reccomend it. Grab a god roll while they're hot!
---
Right, and can we also have more than one? I‚Äôve got my ‚ÄúI want to build a camp here‚Äù points and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to find treasure here‚Äù points but since there can only be one, I end up just taking non-descript photos on my phone :/ and likewise I do get curious about why my teammates have the destinations they do ... maybe while it‚Äôs still a mystery, one could make a game of it by traveling to their teammates‚Äô points and trying to see what makes it significant.
---
I would have to say no. If anyone else knows. I would love to have the keypad on the brick side also.
---
Thinking about it the usual stuff I run could be turned into a wasteland legend and building a base to fit that could be a good idea. A masked man picking targets at long range and employing a Monstrous claw for close range 
---
I ran Marine Tactical Helmet/Hunter‚Äôs Long Coat (but now I‚Äôve changed to the Chinese stealth suit helm) with a lever action rifle and Deathclaw Gauntlet for the longest time.
---
Thorn has an inherent sneak bonus, that's why.
---
I run full solar, but dont think I can check for you.
---
Most public teams are quiet with everyone doing their own thing, but every now and then you find a lively one and it does make the game more enjoyable.
---
I just futz around alot.   I use the game to wake up, relax, etc., mostly.   It's how I escape chronic pain.
---
I know it may seem hindersome, but the best thing to do is fast travel to those players and help them by gifting/dropping the items. It makes a huge difference and there's no waste.
---
Isnt it 400 per card? I dont think this sistem was made for us to have all cards maxed out at all...
---
....no....
---
Even duping is in essential the same duping glitch yiu had in fo4. It¬¥s a bit mor complicated, but in essentials for me it looks like it\`s still using the same basic mechanics.
---
Not to mention that one campground with the earthquakes and shit.
---
how do you have 50y i‚Äôm your reddit account?
---
See what happens when you take too much Psycho
---
Having finished my rep grinds and completing my SS set to at least the primary effects I want and being a solid way into the SCORE grind I'm happy with where I am but I am starting to regret the 3-4 hours a day that aren't being spent on other games.
---
1.5k, fuck that. I might as well stop playing now since I'm never getting to that level
---
To be fair, I did stop playing adventure at level60 and only played Nuclear Winter, But I'm good at it, so I guess I got my XP from there.
---
But that would just give everyone a ton more space to store NON stackables, which would then effect the server I guess.
---
If you think the goal of the game is grind you're going to have a bad time. 
---
The core of 76 is a fun and casual game to play, and is much better with friends.
---
Part of the problem is Bethesda didn't want that to be what the game is about. They thought pvp survival would be great, that didn't pan out, and all they were left with is a fun but casual game to play.
---
Like everyone else in the industry, that isn't enough for them, they want to monopolize your time and therefore monopolize as much of your (entertainment) money as they can. You don't need to do that though. Find a pace that's right for you and do as much of the time limited stuff as you can. While I'm concerned about the time commitment of seasons, for example, they did make good, for the most part, on making the challenges genuinely easier and something you can do by playing the game normally.
---
SD doesn‚Äôt work on legendary gear, plus what‚Äôs the different of getting 2 same god roll or script materials that can‚Äôt even trade or drop?
---
Well then I am clean. Only items I have caught from venders are plans and legendaries I insta grinded. Also never done any player to player trading outside of player vendor machines. I may be playing the game wrong.
---
I have to say this works vice-versa. I love finding low levels to take under my wing and help build them up, I've made a lot of friends that help me level up in games I'm new to.
---
I was just talking about this yesterday. Feels like the Devs decrease the spawn rate of creatures during these challenges. Spawned at the high school 3 times and no Mongols each time and then decided to start trying the airport for scorpions. Any other time I spawn at these locations I'm almost guaranteed creatures EXCEPT today. Found all mine but ran all over the map hunting them.
---
This system rewards everyone who is using the God mode exploit and punishes all of the honest players, typical Bethesda
---
I'm sorry to hear that. I've only done NW to do these challenges. But honestly, they aren't required. I skip them on my days off.
---
If you're on PC, I would gladly help the best I can. Maybe I could be a decoy or something.
---
Just try not to get worked up about them. Bethesda really is shit at making new content so there isn't much for us to do to earn score points.
---
I play Fallout 76 for at least a couple weeks then I take a break from it after I get tired of playing it. It can range from 1 month to almost a year. It would make more sense if they had the full catalog there for me to buy everything I want.
---
That's some Blood Eagle level shit right there ...
---
Lay off the chems m8 :D
---
Pro-tip: through-wall conduits are a clunky thing. But I need to know: do these function as normal vendors?
---
I saw someone earlier today nuke Whitesprings, but intentionally (I assume) miss all the ghoul areas and mostly hit the train station with much of the right of it instead... probably trying to lure out the Mole King.
---
Yep that any any crafting cards that don‚Äôt impact gameplay. Weaponsmith for example would still need to be equipped but not superduper
---
Start with 10% each quarter until it starts making issues then roll it back a bit.
---
76ers we must unite not kill each other like so many of us do we must come together and rebuild Appalachia. administer the vaccine make bases at smarter places start on rebuilding a working economy we can do it vault dwellers I believe in you
---
I've twice had a much lower level run in to my camp and start shooting me. I am a bit above 100 doing a high armor (only around 650) melee build and they come in shooting me with a 10mm submachine gun or something for a while.  They are doing no damage so I just ignore them and eventually they leave. I am on PC and assume it some kinda scam
---
If you wanna buy some chems i have tons of them just saying dm me üëÄ (ps4)
---
You can dupe anything that you can sell to a vendor
---
yeah yeah but if u read the description of this perk... :)
---
Spend those atoms on some punctuations
---
I am level 328 with about 1200 hours and most of that playing time is due to COVID.  At this point there is not much use in trying to get more than one or two cards.
---
Watoga is always great for alcohol and dogfood.  Can be a pain if the robos are hostile to you though.
---
Yea its a for sure dick move on their end trying to get people to play nw mode when I know its not for me but need all the score possible to keep on track.  I meam if they dont want people to do that then they shouldnt do nw score and add anotherbdaily score to adventure.  Sneaky fuckers lol.
---
Reading this wants me to do that
---
Plot twist: without duping, you would never find one. No you have a good chance
---
Is any robot vendor. It would disable the main way for people to get caps (other than selling at their own vending machines)
---
I can take the current grind.  But seeing those legendary perks and having to pay coins to equip them will probably see me quit the game altogether.
---
I've got better things to be doing with my time.  If I'm not having fun with the game I'll just find something else.
---
I recently attended One Violent Night and was attacked for playing an instrument. I'm not sure why this guy was upset at me as we only had 8 or 9 minutes to lure the wendigo out. I've attended this event several times and this is the first I've been attacked
---
One of the best things about public groups, for me, are all the people making event teams and then... just not doing events. Like none. They're off doing dailies or or something and would be much better off in a builder group. Also sometimes I'm the only one bothering to share a perk.
---
You will only level up depending on your intelligence big brain 
---
If you only have 3 int then you won‚Äôt level up as quick and the people who are over 500 have actually farmed for hours and hours just for xp or have done a glitch for xp
---
When you craft anything, there is a 30% chance you'll get double results!  
---
 keyword: anything.
---
lol (c)
---
Unlikely considering certain weapons and effects seem to bypass this. For example explosive legendaries still deal explosive damage in VATS. If it was an intentional nerf they'd more than likely disable VATS on other players entirely (not that that would be a bad thing necessarily).
---
If on PC, do you have the built-in V-Sync (Frame Limiter) disabled? I was also shocked how low my FPS were the moment I installed the game for the first time, but disabling this single option firstly uncaps your FPS, second raises them...
---
In Fallout76.ini:  
---
Find section \[Display\]  
---
and set iPresentInterval=0
---
iirc fallout 4 duping (at least the most common one) included some kind of underflow in the trade menu to get the game to give you a basically infinite amount of ammo or whatever else. In 76, most of the dupes include trying to desync the server and the player stats so the game considers you both having the item on your person and having put it somewhere into the game world
---
Yeah I'm about level 160 ish after 400 odd hours, there's no way I'm getting to level 1500, ever.
---
You on PC? I have 4 bloodied guns for sale. 2 of which are explosive also. Level 50 ***
---
Oh right.  Sorry brain jumped tracks on that one
---
thanks for the info.
---
Exactly! It‚Äôs why I was surprised to see all three with mics up
---
Sounds so fucking satisfying should of asked me to do it
---
toxic valley, near ponds there are often radstags chilling out and 3-5 yao guai or snally gashers or toads. They give 5 acid, screws always.
---
to scrip another one.
---
and actually i would go with to equal shotguns. when the 1st one is broken i can equip another one.
---
Do the math, it does not add up at all FYI.
---
70 days in game time
---
5 hours every day of the year
---
Doesnt mean they wouldnt think of taking them offline for a while. I hope they dont but it wouldnt surprise me
---
Sends a chill down my spine, too real
---
Also. Jet pack.
---
Wanna get those scout positions up on the roofs for clearing out.
---
Mines is disabled :/ that‚Äôs the first thing I made sure was disabled since back then playing my FPS was only around in the 70ish. But now I just uninstalled the game. I‚Äôm going to give it a whole day until installing:/ it‚Äôs the only game that‚Äôs doing it other games I can play correctly with all settings in ultra. Even with my setting on low for fallout 76 it‚Äôs low FPS with full screen. But ultra settings on windowed works great.
---
You don't need to register again. You arleady should have bethesda account to play the game.
---
When you boot the game for the first time it asks to login with your bethesda account. If don't own one before you probably created a new one. You need THAT login and password.
---
I can help u: ingame nickname "maneteren" add me and come
---
One time I had somebody call me an idiot cause I tried to give them (they are like level 5) some purified water and stimpacks and they called me stupid and said they already have some water like what did I do
---
I am hoping just patch it. They have had 24 hours so far... and the quick patch is to clean/refresh vendors as soon as the player leaves a trade
---
I saw in utube that granades (made of floater¬¥s pus) can be doubled this way. and u buy plans from the same guy.
---
What I like the most in this game is visiting other's camp's. Tells a lot about how they are playing the game. A little cottage near a nuclear power plant, a comfy brick house at the top of a mountain, a small wooden cabin next to the water with **15** **industrial** **water** **purifiers** ..
---
I wasn't asked of logging in to my bethesda account during the free weekend and yesterday. I didn't create any account whatsoever.
---
Yeah, I duped and regret it so much, now the only thing I really grind for is to level
---
I will give this a test now and report back
---
Any particular reason you need to run exclusive fullscreen? Try Borderless, it acts just like full screen but is easier to click out of the game / alt+tab and has less potential to crash when window switching :) 
---
Or is it while in borderless mode? I never really tried exclusive fullscreen, always borderless because I have two monitors, makes life easier..
---
Do not get rid of your stuff, you never know what happens. **At least keep for yourself one playable character**, so you can jump back when you feel it :) Because we all know, you ll be back someday :)
---
NPC shops get new caps/scrip/bullion 20 hours after you first sale. If thats what you mean.
---
e.g. sell your first item at 11 a.m. on monday.. at 7 a.m. on tuesday the vendor will restock.
---
Added. Awaiting accept.
---
They've both been trash drops for me so far
---
But what are you refering to now? About obtaining level 1,500 for the perks? Cause I do know that lol.
---
I got a fixer from the settler wanderer.... so ü§∑ RNG?
---
Sorry, newbie I think what is twink?
---
this is so cool! really wish they would add maccready's stuff to the game, miss that rat bastard. or just add him wholesale. who cares
---
I'm guessing that's Rocksys one? If that's the case yh mines been bugged for about a week now
---
I spend my time legendary hunting, building, doing dailies and hoarding. I think I have a problem though because I cant stop! I have a minimum of 20k of each resource and some things like steel, lead and acid I have a lot more of. I have 120k steel...HELP ME!! Lol
---
On my planet called earth.
---
Why are you doing the NW challenge?? Nobody with a sane mind does this. The 250 SCORE points are not worth it. 
---
And the other challenges are definitely made in under 20 minutes. Today is extra easy. You have to roll your face over the keyboard for the challenges to complete. I still have no idea why finishing a daily quest (completed while repuation grinding for the factions, so easily made during normal playing), scrap or build a piece of PA (cost me 1 minute at the next PA station or 10 seconds if you chose to use the scrap option), kill 10 Super Muties, level up (new character, so fixed 5 minutes) and make a photo via photomode cost you an hour and is considered a chore. 
---
You are either REALLY bad at this game, or you really think that investing 2 hours for 2000 Score is worth it when you can get 1750 Score in 20 minutes. Either way, your problem. 
---
And you have no idea what a "scam" is. When it is really scam, try to sue them, you will suceed. But i guess you have problems seeing what scam really means, and that your inability to control your fear of missing out is the real problem. No one ever said, that every player is entitled to every reward the seasons give. So your whole yaddayadda about "charging" you for "content" is BS from the beginning. And when the entry argument is BS, the rest doesn't get better. Again, i don't know why you think that all the other rewards on the way suddenly don't count. You act as if only stage 100 gives the player something, and that the other 99 stages are there to pull your money out of your pocket.
---
Problem is, people like you are not reasonable. You are so angry that no sane argument will count for you. But, that is the time of whine and outrage for you in a nutshell. Beth gives away free stuff and the people complain about not getting ALL the free stuff for nothing.
---
Settler wanderer?
---
Ever since I been gaming on pc everything has been full screen lol I have no reason to play on a small window while having other things as my background and icons on the back that‚Äôs a big distraction I‚Äôm not sure who plays like that:p also it‚Äôs both window and border less window that works great playing but doesn‚Äôt let me make it full screen :/ I‚Äôm also on two monitors I disconnected my 42 in monitor and tried to see if it‚Äôll work good with one monitor that is 32 inch but still doing the same issue with full screen
---
Also seeing your Windows updated, do you have XBox DVR turned off? Make sure it didn't turn itself back on ...
---
[Disable DVR](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-and-remove-game-bar-windows-10-creators-update)
---
There's also a new feature in the lastest Windows (Don't have it yet) under Graphics:
---
[Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling](https://uploadvr.com/hardware-accelerated-gpu-scheduling/)
---
Not sure if it can turn itself on, but make sure you have yours off, it is buggy in many games.
---
You on ps4 any chance?
---
 lol only asking because I‚Äôve had 3 or 4 nukes now just randomly dropped in the weirdest and such wasteful locations lol
---
Some of those events are great for junk and exp, I'm straight there for Berkeley usually crickets and sometimes the rewards are decent amount of junk too. A quick friendly hello emote in their face usually smooths things out. I'm finding out though you find more douchebags at events than workshops nowadays. Been using a low level Tesla rifle on my commando character for tagging everything and only   a tiny chunk of their health so everyone gets a slice of the pie but finding a lot of gits trying to shoot me at the end of events to steal my junk or 50 caps, worst culprit was the guy who decided to shoot at me at the end of a queen fight after I saved him from a yuo guai
---
The drop all comes from the same Pool, so technacly if you even learn the wastelanders weapons like gauss shotgun, you can get a chance to recive one from any legendary drop from event completing or daily quest i think
---
Should have been more specific, i mean the atomic shop
---
Wow
---
This made me exhale heavily through my nose
---
I will have to do this tomorrow since I uninstalled the game decided to give it a full day until installing again but I‚Äôm pretty sure I had it off, actually don‚Äôt recall I seen that setting pc to be honest ?
---
Go to Sugar Grove, loads of fans, gloves to scrap. Few typewriters and those fuel canisters that scrap for a screw as well.
---
'Thanks for your understanding'

For real, before I bought my first SS piece I would spend days buying 3 star armour pieces trying to get an unyielding piece and I only just realised I can get unyielding from one stars and all the other Biff's from 3 stars are useless to me.
---
Stuff like being able to breath underwater or poison resistance
---
76'ers Unite!!
---
For the one player with 1700 hours GAmeplay on one toon
---
If you've learned the fixer plans any ally quest has a chance to drop one. Slim chance though.
---
Borderless acts just like fullscreen if you set your resolution right, except maybe for HighDPI scaling if you have a 4k monitor and want your game to downsample to 1080p/1440p... Then I'd see it as an issue and fullscreen is truly your only solution ...
---
Yeah I got the plan but thanks just needed more info, much appreciated
---
The season is kind of a joke. Yh the rewards are average to just above but the bugs mixed with the near impossibility of reaching max rank before the season ends coupled with the challenges so easy you can be done with them in an hour make it an underwhelming experience and another layer of grind
---
Could always use a newsboy cap in the meantime?
---
 I refered to the glitch where a player stores an item in their storage then returns it to  their inventory fast enough, the item will duplicate itself.  
---
No it involves another player and another step..  At least the one right now does afaik. It\`s quite simple and in essential (from the user p.o.v.) ist quite similar. At least to me it seems that way. I won\`'t describe the process.. and I despise duping. But i wondered why these things always come up in new, slightly varied fashion. And it simply looked so much alike to this fo4 duping glitch. I execution that is..
---
The games built to make them money not deliver a great experience.
---
Buy some 1*unyielding armour and a 1*bloodied handmade and you are set, then upgrade over time.
---
Ok i figuired it out, i went into the game, settings, [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net), it showed my email and i pressed T for the verification email. I got the email will probably make an account after this step.
---
How did you name your custom.ini file in the `C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76` directory? if you named it `Fallout76Custom.ini`, change it to `Project76Custom.ini`. For some reason or another the Game Pass version of the game is called `Project76` instead of `Fallout76` when it comes to the file names.
---
Upvoted because I like people who admit when they made a mistake. It is rare seeing this on reddit.
---
Confirmed, game needs to be installed on or moved to the primary drive via apps and features.
---
Do morgantown, spawn near the college. Easy peasy.
---
Well the raider punk gives those wonderful bone clubs and lead pipes so i just....
---
(angry fasnacht noises)
---
I get some seriouse Escanor Vibes
---
 Confirmed the above fix works, game needs to be installed on or moved to the primary drive via apps and features.
---
Yes, obviously, but anyone with half a brain can see that this game has the potential to be a lot more than just a quick money grab.
---
A shitty experience is likely to be followed with people simply not buying the next product the company releases.
---
I dunno. The characters just seem so stiff and emotionless most of the time.
---
I‚Äôve been playing this game with the same 4K set up never had this issue once occurred. Also I fixed the resolution in window mode and it still will not fix the screen it just closes out my entire game so I stopped messing with it it‚Äôs only this game though nothing else it‚Äôs been about 4 hours now but hopefully it fixes tomorrow since this game is the game I mainly play due to other games being boring at the moment. I also checked other online trouble shoots and so far the resolution is normal including everything else from what I read so far but overall nothing seemed to be working in the game for me. If it doesn‚Äôt work I just plan on giving the game a break for a few days, weeks or months maybe since I am level786 lol including my mule level 519
---
I was telling my wife that Bethesda May have wanted more pvp, but it turned into more of a community. I love learning more about places like Helvetia, I want to visit. Imagine if half the people who played showed up for Fasnacht.
---
this is just what a synth would say!
---
Exactly the same. All I use caps for is the 6k gold per week and cant remember the last time I was under 20k so doing this just pays for my weeks gold. I did have one guy that bought all my jetpack plans, (2 raiders for 150 each and 2 t45 and 3t60 for 250 each) then I go to his camp to see him putting them all in his vendor for 1000 each.
---
I bet places in the East are mad on Fo76 with thousands of level 1000+ players being the norm. I wouldn't be at all surprised if that were the case and Bethesda are just looking at those figures for all their decisions.
---
I wonder if Tencent are invested in Bethesda Grind Studios?
---
I got one yesterday. I found mine with the ashheap maps drop. I had to dig. And RNG dropped a dragon. My 3rd one.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about those. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw one though.
---
sometimes but unfortunately not all the time
---
Really? Thats's wierd... I played during free weekend in the middle of the May (I think it was may 15th) and it asked me for my bethesda acc when I booted up the game for the first time. I used my already existing account and my username ingame was the same as on the bethesda site.
---
I wrote a mod for Fallout 4 to play some rock, can‚Äôt get it to work on another pc though.
---
Because pc is best.
---
I remember that doh moment for me
---
This will severely decrease grind time.
---
This will severely decrease daily logins.
---
This will severely decrease investors  interest.
---
This will severely decrease money income.
---
Think about modern games from monetisation point of veiw, not from players enjoyment.
---
is FFR on bows possible?
---
The way I think about it is I'm paying for atoms 
---
But I also receive pay 2 win scrap box and cool outfits
---
This seems to coincide with player footsteps going silent too. I‚Äôve had to reload the game to fix it
---
That's what I do and I message them to check the box at the camp.  Or I chill by the vault and drop them a bag next to the balloons and Mr. Handy.  Some people ruin everything.  If you are new and need stuff inbox me.
---
it'd be nice if we could spend caps/bullion to get bigger camp budget, but nah, that be fun
---
I thought it was 500 perk coins to max out a card (100 coins per level) for the attribute cards, and for the likes of the infiltrator perk card, it was 250 perk points. 
---
so you would have to reach level 2500 - 3000 depending on your perk card choice which is ridiculous. 
---
I consider myself a casual player (averaging 25-30 hours max a week so far during seasons).  I'm level 132. I honestly can't see myself getting maxed out  Legendary perk decks. 
---
I personally think it should be 25 perk coins/points per level, I also think they should have made the exchange rate 5 coins per card if they keep the 100 coins per level requirement.
---
It‚Äôs funny cause he‚Äôll most likely never sell them, lol. But i can‚Äôt say too much, i was doing some hustling when i was starting out. I was actually doing math on everything so i could buy it for X amount and sell for X amount. I actually enjoyed it, i wasn‚Äôt being ridiculous with it and some things were NPC bought but the quantity convenience was the extra cost. I would make enough to rebuy the stuff and spend some on myself.
---
Sadly, yes.  
---
My stash box is almost full even when I have the scrapbox so that's one less thing to worry about - you can "play" more and worry less about storage space.  
---
The survival tent is great if you need to quickly unload junk you have on you and have no red rocket or other stash places in sight and cannot fast travel due to weight ...  
---
And the "private world" is great if you need to farm without guesswork or need some me time :D
---
ah i see..ususally tuesday 10 a.m. ET I thinks it 18:00 ( 6.p.m.) for me here in germany in summer and 5 p.m. in winter.. Same time they "update" the game.. as far a one can call that updating.
---
You don't even need a rug anymore. Just use the sinking glitch. There's vids on YouTube showing you how. Much easier and faster
---
No way in hell. The playerbase hates how grindy this game is, and it gives new players a chance for legacy weapons now. This balances out everything in PVP, events, it's a great thing for the players to get what they wanted.
---
Bethesda can't ban 95% of their players, and they are making money with more people on their games. These are times that fallout is fun, the trading, new opportunities, payback to all the scammers and people illegally selling guns, armor, and outfits, what's not to love?
---
This had me in stitches hahaha
---
So damn true too
---
Almost certainly down to some miscommunication before release, and they just decided to roll with it. As OP said, you‚Äôd think it would be an easy fix, but you can say that about many things in this game.
---
Had that too. Deleted the bass instrument in my C.A.M.P, because I didn't know what else could be the cause. But now I have silent footsteps.
---
Same, id love to buy plague armor PA skin, some foliage pack that was recently
---
gosh, at least perhaps for Fallout 1st users? You could get a catalog with additional items to purchase for discount?
---
Are they finally doing monthly outfits though?
---
Idk i haven't bought fo1st in a while
---
Yeah I took my junk out of my scrap box and wow it made quite a difference
---
Raider punk, becket, commander dogpoop and the old man can all send you after weapon cases.  Still have not found the settler wanderer but I would assume that since all of the other ones can than literally any of them are probably able to.
---
The weapon cases award you a random weapon, could be melee or ranged that pulls from the same loot table as the purveyor.  You could get a fixer, you'll probably just get junk though.
---
I think it didn't ask me to register because i played during the free weekend. Anyway, it showed my email in the settings section and "Press T for verification email", i pressed T and got an email verification and procedeed to creating my account with a username and password and a security question. So all's good! Back to the game i go! If you're from europe want me to add you?
---
They have one for this month. Don't get your hopes up.
---
Yeah I got a 3* rolling pin yesterday that‚Äôs why I came to reddit loooool
---
I saw ‚ÄúJuly‚Äôs free item‚Äù in the news tab so I thought they‚Äôre doing monthly outfits but yeah they probably aren‚Äôt
---
I made a brand new character specifically to play finally play with my friends. We've all enjoyed hanging out together, building themes camps and running Nuclear Silos, the Burrows and plenty of events together. 
---
As soon as we finished Wastelanders and got access to spending bullion I opted to keep the gold and buy every plan I could for the Gauss Pistol since I wanted to try a pistols build as I hadn't before. Something to work towards and spend time on trying to make work. The very first and second Legendary crafted pistol was Bloodied. I have two Bloodied Gauss Pistols, full demolitions expert and pistols perks and not a thing in game remains a challenege anymore. 
---
I have nothing to work toward. Nothing else in the bullion store is worth the grind to earn. I could get a full set of Secret Service gear but my BOS Combat Armor is still good. I don't need the new armor which kind of makes the time gate for currencies appear even dumber to me. The Legendary Journey is fine, but it needed new events to play alongside it. We need dungeons and we need those dungeons to go on rotation to keep things fresh. I've hit a point where I have nothing left to do so I'm going to take a break for a while.
---
Well that sucks.
---
I have 2tb SSD's for games, but my Windows primary drive is only 120gb, with 60gb free space. (used purely for Windows and some software). 
---
The fact that you have to install this game on your primary drive to get it to work is beyond stupid. I've never had to do that with any other PC game ever. Pretty sure if a game made you do that on Steam it would be removed.
---
Had a guy take a couple of shots at me one day, two rounds from my exploding shotgun and he ‚Äòported very fast.
---
Yes and no. I like the tent and unlimited scrap, but i only had it for 2 months. I have 1500hrs in the game.
---
But if you dont need much scrap it is not worth if you ask me
---
yeah its going to take me about another year or more at this rate.
---
1500 for **6** to max
---
f you if you want to ever swap leveled perks lol
---
Yeah same here, only 120 GB SSD for Windows (c:)
---
I also didn't know. Guess I just assumed they'd weigh nothing
---
(imagines wasteland old school tennis outfit ala Borg/McEnroe era)
---
I love this idea do it for bobbleheads also.
---
What are you talking about? ESO has been out for ages, this game is using an outdated engine, regardless if its a small studio, its a big fucking company and big fucking franchise, why does fallout have a PTS and not a legitimate team of game testers? Cause its a fucking cash grab, see most people dealt with it because the genre it was apart of, there isnt a survival pvp game on the market right now that isnt janky as fuck. Dayz, Rust, the list goes on, all of these games are jank as fuck but because of the way PVP is set up around an open world with survival mechanics it brings the games to life. Take aways those mechanics you have the most jank Fallout game ever created. This game shouldnt be ran by bethesdas smallest studio, it shouldnt be tested by the fucking paying customers. The hole thing is a fucking joke, I have 1500hrs in this game, prolly 1450hrs pre wastelander, before the game became a barbie dress up and doll house building simulator. And than lots not even get into Nuclear Winter, the worst battle royale on the market, like who in there right mind would play Nuclear Winter over PUBG, Fortnite, or Warzone? Its all just a cash grab, I dont see why people cant seem to understand this.
---
a must have for the vengeful wasteland chef
---
This 100% worked.
---
Even 1500 to get all levels maxed is stupid, that's such a high bar that it'll put a lot of people off from trying at all. Even if you want to argue that 1500 is possible, the game is meant to be fun and having to level up that high defiantly won't be.
---
Is it true that you can‚Äôt actually put a door on it?
---
Must not play on PC?  I have loads of rare plans that have mostly been worthless for 6 months now.  Kinda stinks.
---
The scrapbox is great, the tent ist very useful, the 1650 atoms are nice, especially now without the chance to grind them (yeah I know but 1350 in 3 months season.. really?.. thats more like a kick in the shins).. it is not the worst deal I have ever seen..
---
But for me.. I don¬¥t really wanny support the company.. because overall they are not doing such a great job.. And 1st for me ist like giving tip to a waitress oder waiter. Great service eqauls great tip.. in case of fo76 service leaves much to be desired imho.
---
That why I still play wasteland junk tycoon and micromanage everything into oblivion. But I agree.. thats not for everybody.. On the other hand.. Pay extra only for the removing the need to do it? Your decision..
---
In terms of beiing worth you cash? Even with my concerns about it.. Most likely yes.
---
My new end game ended up like this; I farmed materials and crafted 31 Gauss Shotguns till I finally got my 1st Bloody one. But it's other stars were meh so I went to 43 total trying for a better one but a VATS change/bug after patch made it have terrible accuracy and not hit things a lot of the time so I stopped using it. 
---
...So I wanted to try Plasma Caster instead. While too exhausted by RNG to keep count this time; I probably made somewhere around 30-50 of them by now with no Bloody yet, or anything else worth using. At best a Junky with fire rate but I don't use that build.
---
I'm not a pay2win player so I look forward to finally making the weapon I want to play around with so I can drop all the junk I horded to craft them and actually be able to move on that character to play it. Otherwise I just log off and play something else till Scrip reset.
---
They only played classical music in FO4 too so the decision was made all the way back then for whatever reason.
---
I have done it. It's hard to explain, you gotta place a floor piece close enough to the floor you want the door on. Then place the door on the super close floor piece and constantly rotate/flip the door piece and it'll Jimmy it's way in there. 
---
I hope I explained that right, it's late af.
---
they have never deleted dupes before so don't expect it. The only time they have is when people had huge stacks of certain items.
---
Wait for that stupid Camp Fire scout quest, when you have to find the missing campers stuff dont do it and just hang out, endless swarms of bloodbugs for like 25 minutes, they have something that breaks down to acid, you can get a fuck ton.
---
Nah I'm good. Thanks. I'm from Russia... not exactly the Europe lol. Anyway glad you got that username issue resolved.
---
Nope. PS4. It got hit with the previous duping though. I think things have at least a bit improved since.
---
It's an exploit with the explosive bow.
---
That‚Äôs really a decision for you to decide isn‚Äôt it?
---
spoken from the bottom of my heart.. I\`ll be at your side.
---
They kicked me out of my house and put a guy there that just  bangs on a wall with a hammer. 
---
Feels.
---
Not like their current approach isn't pissing off everyone.
---
Where do you get your 1350 from? You can get 2000 from seasons.
---
Ten cents is not
---
I agree with your general point but icicle lights are not the best example. I regularly sell them for higher than 100c. It's not because they are rare, it's because lots of people have excess caps rather than having a shortage of caps.   
---
I sell most of my plans for 9c though. I like making low levels happy and they're really the only ones who are going to buy most of the plans.
---
Could you do a bro a solid and please tell me where you found all these creatures? I‚Äôve spent an hour in a game mode I like as much as sh!t on toast with nothing but a growing hate boner to show for it.
---
a purge, scorched earth policy... but people would be angry
---
Spawn rates haven't changed since Morgantown launched months ago.
---
I saw a 1400 - thought it was a fake as I was 25 at the time LOL
---
This is why I keep making new characters, but I'm bored of that too since there isn't exactly a lot of variety.
---
They put some scumbag family where my Camp used to be that now tells me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong‚Äù there and to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù. BASTARDS. I can‚Äôt even kill the fucks because they‚Äôre ‚Äúimportant to the story‚Äù.
---
If these people were in any other Fallout game I‚Äôd never be able to complete it because I‚Äôd kill ALL OF THEM.
---
It's a miniboss now, easier than SBQ - still has 30k HP and a 30% damage reduction, and like 300-400DR, but a yawn fest otherwise, even for a non-bloodied full HP heavy gunner I am. One or two 75 wendigo spawns here and there.... poison attack baaad for bloodied builds but otherwise, easy :)
---
Did him for the first and last time two days ago with my gf. It was a waste of a nuke but I just wanted to try ... down in like 5 minutes (yeah non-bloodied dmg was like 33 per hit, wasted something like 5k ammo on him)
---
Why not just drop them off somewhere and lighten your load? It's not like you need the plans after you learn them. No sense in weighing yourself down or filling your stash/vendor with a bunch of stuff that doesnt sell. Stop torturing yourself with over encumbrance. Be a plan philanthropist and drop them in some suitcases at train stations.
---
I would not call it much more powerful. Its a tiny bit stronger than ultracite. A guy did a bunch tests with a lvl 95 behemoth and there was a 3 dmg difference in hits taken between the t65 and ultracite/t51b. That was at health without lone wander, blocker or any other damage mitigation perks.
---
Though I do agree it's stupid how difficult they are to get
---
and here I thought end game was endless C.A.M.P. redesign
---
Well pretty much any b2525/b3325 fixers and handmades, red asylum dress, all the named jumpsuits (forest camo, white powder, BOS) and the God rolled armor items like uny or van/ap/sent, and legacy weapons like explosive lasers or dragons
---
Sure bolton greens usually has a bunch if mutant hounds and the power plants but they can be popular spots but you can luck out.
---
Hopefully it gets sorted out sooner rather than later so you guys don't end up as bad off as the PC market at least.  I've just given up hope of the market recovering at this point.  I'll put plasma grenade plans in my vending machine for 25 caps these days.
---
Well something changes during these challenges because I play NW daily. My go to spot is The Airport...and there's ALWAYS scorpions there. Likewise whenever I run near or behind the high school, ALWAYS Mongols....Except yesterday in 6 matches in a row......
---
In my opinion the game was built with the idea that future DLC would be paid for. Then some bright spark decided to make it so that all DLC would be free, so they had to butcher the game into something that would make enough continuous revenue to support the development, without making the jump to a Free-to-Play game supported solely by micro-transaction. 
---
They tried to find the middle ground between AAA title with paid for DLC, and a Free-to-play with micro-transactions. Their level of success is subjective I suppose, but I think they've done an OK job apart from the huge daily play incentive lately (as appossed to longer 1-2 weekly sessions).
---
I mean, you get his balls so that‚Äôs pretty cool
---
I know what you mean, there's actually a considerable number of ways to build a character... but if you want to do any meaningful damage or have any stats you kinda need to go Bloody (something) or stealth commando or whatever is meta nowadays.
---
Say what?
---
Thank you...with this, I fixed the display issues. 
---
When you say server issues, what is it doing on your end?
---
It's almost like they're rare
---
I had the exact same problem and deleted a bunch of stuff. I'm now left with 3 gigs on my SSD after installing fo76 to it. I'm sorry to say for you that it did indeed fix the problem.
---
Did Bethesda really not test that lmao.
---
I like to move my camp periodically anyway for a variety of reasons... but that's definitely one. I'm not patient enough for that, no matter how much I love my camp. It's part of the reason I got into building around in-game content like monorails, cabins, caves, etc... my camp could be placed 100% of the time.
---
Yes
---
Really appreciate it, cheers mate!
---
That to, it's basically the only reason Im around. Turn of game sound, podcast on, an interesting location to build in and abuse the build system until you get what you want
---
not a cap. They're not rare or anything.
---
How do you know my stripper name? Please don't tell my husband.
---
Yeah I just went to the wayward an shat out 80 super stims and a medicine bobble. Hope they all divied it up
---
No problem good luck!  Cheers
---
And you'd have the pleasure of picking up their bodies and yeeting them into the nearest bush.
---
Vault 77: To rebuild Appalachia and everything again, because we left a f*ckfest of a game behind xD
---
This is incorrect, 100%.
---
Makes perfect sense the thread is about the Ammo Converter
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
I'm glad these dupes came to exist
---
People who like them do so because they can get God roll gear for cheap. Gear that basically no matter how much they play they would never be able to get.
---
People who don't like them feel that why because it drives prices way down, and since everyone has good gear they feel less special.
---
Turns out the modules aren't in the sale. Oh well. Advice stands though. You may need a LOT of modules. Some people have been very unlucky when it comes to crafting. 
---
FORTUNATELY the gauss shotgun is so powerful that even a shit roll is still great. Like you could have a 1\* nocturnal and you could still fuck up most things with 1 or 2 shots.
---
but if you want a junkies or bloodied or AA. That may take time.
---
They didn't win any friends back when they were deliberately crashing servers.
---
I think it is the popular opinion, just the least vocal one
---
I can't be sure, but since the drop probability calculations can be quite complicated, I presume Beth simply don't know or understand what the chances will be if they put [30% here and there](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P20&amp;formids=0050D800-00437553-0043754D) as well as probably over-estimating the number of players/trials to get the items (i.e., out of 2 million players, maybe 10 got the rare Fasnacht masks in 2019).
---
You do know the dupes crash about 0 servers right? All it takes is two nukes to make enough lag
---
They are all the same with the drops as the drops all come from the same pool. Provided you know the fixer plans then there is a chance to get one from any ally.
---
The ally you have just bouls down to your own preference as to who you prefer, really.
---
There have been some, like the pa dupe, that force crashed servers
---
That was the PA dupe this is completely different (in the sense of no server crashes)
---
dunno i tried different builds, i was a shitty melee player getting bored at 150 and then change to bloodied/junkies and the game got fun again before it was "there isn't many people to do project paradise" now is let's do it solo! and try to get a god tier gauss weapon
---
It's a strange bug and still persists. The first shot pretty much always misses. Any other shots seem to get through, even with lower percentage.
---
Somebody watched the best FO4 parody by seanzoz :)
---
I am aware. But that's not what the guy you responded to was saying, he mentioned that back when they were crashing servers it pissed people off
---
&gt; so any upvotes would help a lot thanks.
---
asking for upvotes is the surest way to get downvoted
---
Yeah. I understand that maxxing out Legendary perk cards should be prestigious and hard to get. But 1500 levels is a step too far. 500 would seem like much reasonable number...
---
You mean you don‚Äôt like having a keypad on the wrong side of the door? Geez, what‚Äôs next, you want a powered pylon keypad access that actually uses the keypad? Let‚Äôs be real now
---
Oh my bad I skimmed over that by accident, I need sleep its 4 AM
---
It's really good for grinding, as you get "first dibs" as it were to spots that are frequented by other players.
---
I use it when I'm low on lead or ballistic fiber, personally, by doing visits of each of the major gym locations as well as Camp McCarren and just loot everything along the way so that items respawn- Every 180 items you pick up, makes the items from before that count respawn.
---
The scrapbox is also really nice considering how much junk you can accumulate without it. I had around 500 pounds of junk before I got fallout 1st.
---
There's also the free fast travel point of the survival tent, which you can put down at any time (say, when you're over encumbered and need to load off some stuff, since it comes with both a scrapbox and a stash).
---
The cosmetic stuff is pretty nice too AND you get to keep it when you unsub.
---
I usually complete on PS4 at Platinum :)
---
I think the ammo converter update is a step in the right direction ,but couldn't they just add a convert all ammo of the selected type option as well?
---
Did they ever fix the pump shotgun bug where enemies that should die regain health?
---
Would you rather they don‚Äôt share your feedback? Exactly what do you want the community managers to do?
---
I am level 328 and did exactly the same thing.  I didn't even learn how to use mutations until level 250.  Just play the game and it will all come to you.
---
Yeah that one was rough.
---
Really brought back some of the dark story vibes from new Vegas.
---
Sadly they're very few and far between.
---
If that was on PS4, about a month or so ago, i think that was me.
---
it's a big grind but just because it exist doesn't mean u need to have every single fking one.
---
i personally would grab the ammo making one, im doing already 2/2.5k damages already enough to kill everything and peace out just if some day i get another card good, if not i don't care
---
Yeah, tbh i think they have MUCH bigger problems to worry about atm......
---
I'd like for the area to be bigger moreso than the budget being increased, but that's probably just a me thing.
---
I dislike this round because if a higher percentage of people have god roll bloodied explosive gatling plasmas, or so called "magic" weapons a higher percentage of SBQ fights will be over before most people get enough damage in.
---
I disliked the other rounds because of mass production of stackables and plans that make people's shops look like they have loads of plans I might need, so it was harder to find them.
---
Basically I don't care how it affects the "economy", just how it affects me playing the game.
---
i dont know, it sounds rather funny to me... maybe because i imagine the whole lotta FUN the actors had during the recording...!?
---
I really like having situational weapons, for example a rifle for long range, a shotgun for close range and something automatic or heavy for when shit's getting scary. I just end up doing no damage with any of them.
---
A lot of people will be taking their new explosive GPS to the Queen and not realize that you can out damage it with most every other gun haha. Since the Queen shrugs off explosive damage. Havnt tried a je yet, but my Ve does like 15 damage a shot at full health. While my Jffr lmg does like 150 a shot
---
Edit, and that 15 damage with all hit, 3 damage per split beam
---
finding his holo in the treestump and listening to it after finding him in the fridge... this thing is DARK and hilarious in one...
---
Yeah I mean I‚Äôm not overly bothered with way but considering I do a LOT of vendor hopping daily and this is the only time I‚Äôve ever seen either for sale, the timing is bound to cause questions. 
---
He did also have the croc backpack and it‚Äôd be my luck to never be involved in it yet get banned for something like that if I got it üòÅ
---
The worst event is Breach and Clear, standing around for 10 minutes killing a few mole miners, and the box's are usually all empty for have a few crappy pieces of ore, at least with Tea Time you get a nice cup of tea afterwards.
---
This isn't a game where you take things it says at face value. Notice how the loading screen tips are about half wrong? Your issue is minor compared the yuge amount of game breaking stuff going on especially at the moment.
---
I sure this is an unpopular opinion but I dont agree with you at all.  Take legendary perks for an example, PA biulds cried and cried about how the non PA perks were to op and PA perks were shit. So Bethesda caved and removed those perks (thx for that by the way yall got nothing better out of it just screwed non PA player) and the ammo converter this sub was flooded with nothing but shit talking about it and what less than a week after it went live they came out a said it was being rework.
---
I'm sorry but all the people I see on here bashing Bethesda saying they dont listen to there community that's BS they just dont listen to YOU.
---
Just buy more legendary modules
---
Afking is a huge strategy, especially when survival time counts for more exp than kills. Not just bots
---
No. Only if you want to wear them. X-01 is better than excavator IMO btw
---
ITS GRAAAFTON DAY... A G A I N... :D :D :D
---
Do you know how hard you need to grind for the rolling XP? Even assuming perfect conditions and runs on a decent high level character the average is like 300-600 score per hour. That is assuming you're using many exp buffs, you never need bullets, and that the method you're using isn't being used by many others.
---
There is still a "cap" on score. Not everyone can grind for ours for
---
Has anyone tested it does power armor reboot work with bloodied builds? or when it says come back with full health does that mean really full hp like removes all your rads?
---
To be fair, if you click the link in game then it takes you straight to the Atom page on Steam, and not the page where the offer is (under DLC).  So I think you can be excused for missing it :)
---
They‚Äôre community managers, not development managers. I get what you‚Äôre saying, I really do. I‚Äôd rather the scrip be at a weekly pool or 500 a day. But they‚Äôre only doing their job. What you‚Äôre wanting the community managers to do is like wanting a sales manager to do the construction manager‚Äôs job at a contracting company. The can pass things along, but they can‚Äôt pull the trigger on getting those things started.
---
Unless they meant "just" as in "barely".
---
If you haven‚Äôt played since launch, you do not have every point on the map discovered. There have been quite a few new locations and many hours of quests.
---
Or just get repair kits. Those are nice. And easy. And free.
---
I'm not questioning the CMs or want them to stop doing their job, I just want to know who "the team" is that receives the feedback. For all we know, and the way everything in this game works sort of backs this up, literally no one on "the team" is an actual player.
---
Did you fast travel everywhere? Sofia‚Äôs quests alone are like 5 hours if you rush them.
---
That was it! No idea why they changed the name, but both of my mods are working great. Thanks!
---
Totally what a drug addict would do, I know tons of drug addicts who would totally do that.
---
Wow this is so true to what a real drug addict would do.
---
That's mean, have some consideration for the bush wookies, for crying out loud.
---
My game haven't crashed once since I returned  when the wastelanders update came. Not a single disconnect either.
---
in the bethesda rotation cycle those were pretty recently they were up when wastelanders got released
---
I've not tried Bloodied but my Anti Armor one does 35 per shot, with adrenal reaction and ~30% health (no heavy perks). I've not decided whether to put a beam splitter or focuser on it yet.
---
Simple, let the Horde boss stay alive.
---
It'll keep summoning more enemies of it's same species every few minutes, and if those enemies have set resources (exp. Yao Guai give Acid and Springs), you can farm them for as long as your ammo, health, weapon durability, and/or your inventory &amp; Stash can hold.
---
I've been grinding quite a bit lately for scrap and caps and the gold thing can get tedious with the timegating not helping relieve that, so I've debating trying other things.
---
Last night I took a break from all the killing - save for a few nuke launches- and went shopping for a bit in the hope of finding an AAE/15% combat rifle to build a commando character. Unfortunately I came up empty and didn't find one with the the AA effect so the hunt continues.
---
Also debating a bloodied build tryout as I got a bloodied gauss rifle from the queen, which again would be a new character as I've spent too long on the T-65 grind to turn my back on it now, to say nothing of the time it would take to get an  unyielding suit together on top of gold for the service armour pieces, but it's out of my comfort zone and might be fun to try.
---
It's just about trying to mix things up a bit to stave off any sense of burnout. Not always easy, but always worth a try.
---
I'm currently locked out of playing f76 cos i'm a console player and you need to buy both the game and ps+ to be able to play it, and due to quarantine shit i lost my job... and my parents won't buy ps+ for me cos reasons... so I'm stuck watching Oxhorn videos instead of experiencing it my self... so a started trying rp in f4, ohh boy is it frickin hard... try to rp a gay person from the ncr... u have to at least be bi, u have to have a kid and u have to be treated like someone who's pre-war and your son is older than you... bethesda telling their story instead of allowing me telling mine... my character is always suprised about everything whist in my headcanon he was an ncr ranger who shouldn't be suprised ag the fact of supermutants or ghouls...
---
is just plain fun :)
---
The 200 gold bullion cap per day is annoying I've ended up with a stack of over 700 treasury notes now because the game will only allow me to spend 20 every 24 hours.
---
Yes its problably a bug and they will patch it i guess. I have only 40 gigs left on my ssd now cause i moved the game there. Its only a temporary solution cause its bethesda and who knows how many days are we gonna have to wait untill they notice..
---
It's like novlang. If there was a text chat we could talk about the game in game.
---
Who is the product manager and how big is the team actually? That's what im *really* curious about.
---
The team are the developers. Seeing as they have done live streams I‚Äôm pretty sure they play he game. 
---
Really what do you want from the CMs though if not pass along feedback?
---
The more intelligence the more xp you get from
---
Kills Iv had 20 intelligence and got 444xp from level 68 yet that all
---
Depends on your build if your a heavy you would get more xp
---
I don‚Äôt quite understand all of the memes surrounding her at the moment, would anyone be able to explain?
---
"The Team" is a group of 4 office temps, who roll on big wheel o' roulette what to do with the reported issue. Red is "No issue, must be working as intended or Just works!", Black is "The reported issue goes back to the pile of reports to wait another turn on the wheel" and lastly Green is "Let Johnson the building Janitor take a look at this issue and see if he can figure out a way to fix it".
---
You find it as part of one of the missing children quests, Picnic Panic I believe its called.
---
Exactly, my backpack and uncovered head disappear when using the stealth armour so I don't see why they can't put outfits on top. Especially as you can wear a skin tight outfit with no sign of your armour underneath üòÜ
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what had me confused, with the last bundles on the other launcher the bundle was just with the atoms too, at least now I know :)
---
I read ballistic bok isn‚Äôt working with heavy guns.
---
He created his account on a punch card.
---
Why would you buy repair kit either I have so many improved repair kits from SBQ ( there better and free) wish I could drop them for people rather than drop them and they be destroyed
---
watchout, heard she's a real golddigger
---
There was a block colour wallpaper bundle which had pink in it, I assume you missed it? Lol üòÇ
---
The splitter. 100% turns it into an automatic shotgun of death. And it will deal way more damage, since every pellet procs a full damage explosion
---
I know, but we've got to start somewhere to get things to change. It worked with the Ammo Converter and it worked with the Fasnacht debacle were "the team" chose to ignore critters not spawning for weeks and, blam, Fasnacht came around and had to be pulled because people got their pitchforks out.
---
I don't see why we should be pleased with how things are going and "passing it on to the team" is getting really, really old after you've read it for god knows how many times. Especially since there is rarely any follow up. Adrenaline is broken for how long now? There's an awful lot of silence on this topic and we're now at just shy of 2 weeks ever since this was broken.
---
I honestly don't have any hard feelings for the CMs, on the contrary, I wouldn't want to trade places with them but communication is basically a part of their job and if all we get out of all the complaints is an improvement in communication, fine.
---
Rad Sponge. Really nice to piss off bloodied players in your group :D
---
Yea I was expecting the discount on modules. I do not want to roll weapons currently just SS armor pieces.
---
- Go to train stations and read the posters for new quest lines
---
- Go to Vault 76 and start the Wastelanders quest line
---
- New places have been added to the map - have a stroll and see what's new
---
Welcome back
---
Why in the  hell would you want all max lvl legendary perk cards? Isn‚Äôt the whole point of this system for you to pick one or two legendary perks to max
---
And then there‚Äôs the flyboy helmet, with no visible torch, lighting up things with a headtorch
---
divided up... or (immediately taken and sold to duchess in order to buy 10mm ammo from ammo vending machine)
---
My wife and I get to play however we want for the cost of a pizza once a month. No waiting, no griefers, no bulshit. You can always go into a public world if you miss those things.
---
this is why we can't have nice things
---
i would love to sell serums at 100 or 200caps but i saw enough players bought me the entire stack for what? to sell for 500caps to the vendor with full unyielding... easy caps, no work!.
---
Hate to be the guy with bad news but Legendary Modules do not work on any of the armor you have stated. It is used to make Secret Service Armor, Thorn Armor, and Solar Armor. Thorn and Solar also take Vault Steel.
---
i accidentally found a way to make my Tesla have 999 in the clip.
---
on XB, no hacks.
---
So how do I craft unyielding armor?
---
yes, pain in the ass.
---
So let me get this straight...
---
Some other player you don't even know has a good weapon, and that somehow ruins YOUR game?
---
The only thing it does is fuck up the Economy but let's be honest, 120k caps for a BFFR Crit Fixer is bonkers on a whole other level...
---
And fuck! I just bought 500 scrip worth
---
You can't craft most legendary armors yourself. They are either drops from events, drops from enemies, or purchased from the purveyor.
---
I have so many atoms and radaway, I give them away or sell them.
---
If you can recreate it there's no reason to keep it. Excavator, X01, T45, T51d, and T60 can be disposed of. Ultracite with rare mods (like an arm jetpack or shocks) should be kept.
---
You don't. It's all RNG. The easiest way would be to shop player vendors and pay caps for it. You might actually find good deals that way and get some nice 3* pieces from it for pretty cheap. Dont worry about matching first just get a full set with useful perks for your build. Once you do that replace the pieces individually with better/matching pieces.
---
not a problem, enjoy modding FO76 :) 
---
word of warning: if you plan on using a ini tweaker you will have to change the .ini file names back to `Fallout76` temporarily and make your changes with the ini tweaker and then change the file names back to `Project76` at least until they get around to updating them to include searching for the `Project76` ini files.
---
Honestly not sure on why they decided to change the name, it's such a weird thing to do when all other launchers use `Fallout76`
---
fast traveling to a player camp just to spawn in to part of a building while it's loading and getting stuck there.  Happens to me all the time
---
Stims, stupid auto correct
---
I feel like a giant idiot now selling all my unyielding early game thinking I could recraft them. But thanks I already have 2 pieces time to search for the rest
---
Often my character will flinch for no reason
---
No worries there. Get Gold Bullion by finishing Wastelanders and but Secret Srrvice or Thorn armor plans. You use the modules at an armor workbench to craft the pieces. Those too are RNG so you may not get unyielding and it can be 1-3 stars on the Secret Service, Thorn is guaranteed 3* but random Primary. I didnt mention Solar because that is high health armor.
---
You‚Äôve been looking for mor than a year? They‚Äôve only existed for 4 months...
---
And you just aren‚Äôt killing enough scorched or ghouls then. It‚Äôs something like a 2% drop. Kill enough of them and you‚Äôll have a ton of tickets. Just got western outfit a few days ago.
---
I got a lot of downvotes for that comment but I watch a lot of horror movies. That scream was bad
---
I guess
---
Some dude came and emptied my 3 machines full of plans on Sunday.  Probably 100 plus plans, multiples of a decent amount of those.  99 percent sure he bought them to flip em all because I sell them all very cheap for low level players.  My jet pack plans go in there for 15 to 25 caps depending on armor type.
---
Don't really care what he planned to do with them but restocking everything and organizing it by machine is a pain in the ass so my vendors have just been unplugged and more or less empty since then lol.
---
5, lowest is level 67, no mules. But i mainly play my first character. I switch characters if i have reached all daily limits but stilll like to continue playing.
---
Yeah that started about a month ago and I‚Äôm not sure if it stopped or I just became used to it.
---
Is it a mutation side effect?
---
Good luck! Be patient too, vendor and server hop. Youd be surprised how many people sell their unwanted stuff in player Vender, even more surprising can be the pricing compared to the Trade Market sites/subs.
---
Thx so much ur a legend
---
I generally like it so far though I wish there were more ways to get SCORE points. Leveling once a day can be a bit annoying once you get to 100+.
---
Nope. There are 5 other daily challenges for you to complete to get that gold star.
---
Or have a quad crossbow..
---
I am at lvl 300 something and try to the same.  Been doing it even before I was lvl 100.  It's always good to pay it forward, especially when you don't need most of the stuff your hoarding.
---
Interesting... I wonder why it didn't do as well on PC. I'm on PS4 and rarely played NW and usually only for challenges, but I didn't ever encounter a time when there were too few players... even when I was online at quite bizarre hours ;)
---
Not every game was built for solely to make money. Game devs used to make games out of passion until incompentent businessmen got added to the mix. Sadly Bethesda went down the same path as Rockstar, where money comes first and players last.
---
Unfortunately I need that gatling gun skin at rank 94.
---
[It will be mine...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7jJnwEeiU0)
---
Just tried it and it booted right up! Thanks for letting us know!!
---
I‚Äôve had it worked while rolling for Secret Service armor parts. It does work on those. I have not tired the weapons though. Haven‚Äôt gotten up there yet
---
I think they actually updated the sentry got one to need the military(?) one now
---
That's the nerf mentality right there, there's a way to make both parties happy and this is the worst approach that they could've taken for the situation.
---
Don't blame the player A who was asking for a better balancing or experience, blame the balancing team who decided to break player B's experience because player A's having a bad time.
---
Once you use the scrapbox there is no going back. Think carefully...
---
There is an actual train cart you can use, left of the air port with the workshop in it
---
Could have sworn this is what the articles that were posted on their website were originally for, until they stopped doing it...
---
Heavy guns suck in vats,
---
Shotguns have bad range and no armor penetration,
---
Rifles don't get weight reduction,
---
Pistols have no armor penetration.
---
Every class lacks something
---
Oh yeah, balistic bock. Thanks man.
---
I‚Äôve been sharing the one that gives you two points more charisma for each person on the team.
---
Shit bro, really?
---
I am lvl 370 with 1700h playtime. Its my only character. That means i need 6.900 h playtime to reach lvl 1500? And then i have ONE perk on max?? Holy sh...
---
is bethesda really going for instance interiors cause that would make the game perform a lot better...imo
---
Dude, if people bought it is because they need it... why discriminate between a lvl 10 and a lvl 240? Stop helping new players... it is proven that people who get helped allot at this game are the first to leave ... you have to fail to evolve and to get into this game... stop carrying noobs... let them learn.
---
I havnt tested it, but I read someone say that couple days ago on here.
---
I was about level 15 when someone came to my camp and I really thought they were gonna take me out in my own house. They gave me a bunch of ammo and stims now that I'm getting closer to 100 I try to do the same.
---
A saw someone set up a separate room and put a sign saying 'low level' 'high level' and it looked like it worked well.
---
I'm starting to get a little bored of it now, I just vendor hope these days to buy stuff I don't need.
---
You can buy 1 and 2\* stuff for a couple of K. That'll start you on your journey. it might not be the best (that's why you're paying a couple of K) but it's unyielding.
---
&gt;SS plans look cool and I grinded bullion for 2 weeks, lets see what I can get! Oh great I have plans for left and right legs, time to grind dailies for 2 months to get the full set which won't affect the gameplay much.
---
i 100% agree with your post, but this is an exaggeration.. in two weeks you can get 3400 bullion. SS limbs are 750 each and the chest piece is 1250. in two weeks you can get all limbs with 400 bullion to spare. you can get the full set in the middle of the third week.
---
Yep, that's why they've put a focus on 'daily' activity to get daily logins from people.  There are caps on the various currencies to again stop someone from logging in one day for 8 hours and instead login once per day for an hour or two over the whole week.  That looks better on the reports.
---
As to the community - sorry but most of you are full of terrible ideas and have no idea how software is written.  If they listened to a fraction of the best of the crap here they'd wind up like Star Citizen in feature creep hell and never get anything done.
---
Maybe if he had decent prices they'd have sold
---
I got the impression it was intentional but it's definitely a change that I find extremely irritating and inconvenient.
---
? What dont I see that doesn't happen? Yes this is the internet and I am giving an opinion...
---
And I would not complain if someone had a ton of plans showing in their vendor if they priced their plans to move... Holding on to several dozen plans and charging a ton for them is a pain to come across. I have no intention on saying Bethesda should somehow limit it. Free market baby! It is a complaint and I think worthy of a discussion. Hence the discussion flair.
---
She's a female character in a video game and she's nice to you and romanceable in fo4 which became like a second life for a lot of players (myself included) in hindsight its actually kind of sad that I felt a genuine connection to an Npc but I was extremely lonely back then and fo4 was my escape. I played that game over 8000 hours so she's like an old friend. But now I play with my wife which is much nicer.
---
Some people just do Radiation Rumble just to farm Glowing One ghouls and clean up the meat piles at the end of the event, wither or not they care about actually doing the event objective.  I've even got some angry emotes from the guys on top because me and two others gathered enough ore to complete the event with 3 or so minutes to spare.
---
Like, come on. I just want to get that Radiation Barrel plan and unique Haz Suit.
---
Its the equivalent of when u call the place you ordered food from and they tell you ‚Äú driver is on there way‚Äù.
---
Are you on pc? I can sell you a set cheap.
---
All my unyielding pieces sell from 500-800caps each.
---
Use a different Bethesda user name to sign up on game pass... if you use the same account, of course they are linked.
---
I like to think someone saw a Fixer for $500 and thought "That's pretty fucked, let's ruin RMT for a few months"
---
Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôm on PS4
---
i would just be happy with some interior walls  i mean how hard is that bethesda we had them in FO4
---
Dude you are the one seeling below market value... its on you... never sell anything below base value. You are the one making bad business, other people just capitolize on that.... yesterday I sold a Peperoni Roll for 4K... bought one at the Raider vendor for 50 caps... my fault? No, lack of costumer information fault.
---
It's not just the addition of new locations but also the addition of NPCs to existing locations
---
It's probably on console as there is console messaging.
---
&gt;I can now launch Fallout 76 from Bethesda, from Steam, and now from XBox, and it's the same freaking game!
---
Really? What were you expecting?
---
The jacket will take a long time even after the skeleton. It's 14k after you get the beanie
---
Damn so sitting him in the middle of my mutfruit field isn't a good idea then?
---
Just got the beanie, so that leaves the winter jacket and the skeleton. They both progress at the same time, so I‚Äôm looking forward to it.
---
Probably cause they don't know what's going on
---
Thanks, I realise now, I was confused about the way it worked, cheers!
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
Her screams aren't the horrifying thing. 
---
That I'm level 342 &amp; still haven't managed to get a single legendary in that event is what is truly horrifying
---
Yes you selfish buggers... hang your heads..... I need chocolate
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
seems like it happens only when in 1st person but in 3rd person i get the stuck in aim mode bug
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. I‚Äôll go to the door and check the keycard reader is there then you join my server and scan the keycard
---
Failing that I have the keycard too so I can just open the door
---
I agree I miss the noti alot.  A great solution would be to put our vendor history of sales in our CAMP terminal that has like 0 functionality but it could do so many useful things.  People have been asking for them to do more with that terminal for ages and it's still so damn useless.
---
On a lot of heads üò¨
---
The Wendigo?
---
Yes but you are 1k away from the Skelton (if I'm matching right) and 14k away from the jacket.
---
To be fair, the fallout series rng has always hated everyone.  You have a 97% chance for a headshot oh look I missed 3 times in a row - fallout 1 through fallout 76
---
You know that orgasm isn't meant to be painful right
---
Aren't instanced basements in the works?
---
I'm paying a subscription to rent a new game. At the very least, that's what I expect. Realistically though, I think the language in the announcement should have been more clear. Even though my xbox and my computer share a common email, they are two very separate accounts.
---
I have no idea what the purpose of this post is and it includes "The reason I'm ranting right now is..." So that's particularly impressive by OP.
---
I scrapped mine because it was useless.  Using it for that would be great.  Maybe hold the last 20 transactions or something.  Also it could have a way to easily select what crafting items to have marked when scavenging. It gets annoying to always have to go back and clear things you already found but forgot to clear.
---
I‚Äôm just glad i bought the jacket from a vendor before they patched it
---
It has been counting for me, I did 8-9 matches the other morning and it went up 3 times. I had to go into adventure mode and log what my score was before and what the repeatable exp was before and after and it did count toward my experience gained for every match.
---
I wish I could tell how far I am on them, tbh. I got the beanie two days ago or so but still haven't gotten the skeleton outfit.
---
RMT ? new one to me
---
A unsettling as holotape "Incident Record 5374"? I think not..
---
RIP Mr Sparkles
---
You need more variety in your life. One of my ex girlfriends screamed exactly the same when she orgasmed.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen, both the beanie and combat armor unlock at 7000. (All the rewards unlocked at the same time to my knowledge).
---
I‚Äôm unsure of when they unlocked, so it‚Äôs the same amount for jacket and skeleton. Think it around 8k. Hopefully.
---
"we'll forward the message and get back to you guys if it turns out anyone gives a fuck"
---
Don't rush things to start with. 
---
Stay on the left side of the map to begin with. Play the main quests until you get to Rose's storyline at the top of the world. Once you get to that point it will start sending you into high level areas.
---
At that point I'd fully explore the whole of the left side of the map while you work on leveling and planning your build. Take your time and enjoy the game, exploring is fun. Once you hit 50 I'd then do the eastern side of the map and finish the wastelanders questline. 
---
Scrap weapons and armor to learn mods, make your own stuff and scrap it to learn more mods. 
---
Sneaking is fun and overpowered with that damage bonus.
---
Play events when they pop up, if they are level appropriate. If you get any clothing from an event, check online as there's a good chance it's a rare drop and worth a lot of money to a collector.
---
Instead of making a fun game to play, they've apparently opted to keep people playing by giving them outrageous grinds. I guess if it works for Runescape, it could here? I can't help but question what kind of players they're attracting, but in the MMO world I guess it's more commonplace.
---
It's a different account, just the same email.
---
100% agree, and the terminal sales log is a great idea as well. But l'm afraid they may have a few more pressing issues to deal with as of lateü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Why is this weird Walmart review in this subreddit
---
There isn't many options to buff ranged weapons, if that's confirmed it would be bad news for sure.
---
Ah I have fo4 but have yet to get very deep into it. I love Bethesda but have been more into the Elder Scrolls side of things, played TESL, ESO, Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. I‚Äôm assuming Piper is kinda like the way people treat Serana in Skyrim. But I feel ya there brother. If u ever wanna talk fallout stuff or anything Bethesda shoot me a PM or add me on steam or discord!
---
I've seen this conception going around, but I know it's not true. I was getting drops of broadsiders for a long time before I just bought the plan the other day for cheap just to learn it. I'm not sure where this thought is coming from.
---
If I run mine via the bethesda launcher itself, it runs poorly and physically not pretty. But through GeForce launcher it's beautiful &amp; smooth.
---
Halloween stacks, so after the pumpkin armour you have 7k to go for the skeleton.
---
But Christmas stuff does not stack. So after the beanie it will take 14k to unlock the jacket.
---
(my original math was wrong originally)
---
double shot 10 mil three star from him yesterday, still useless, but three star.
---
how can you have more than 5 characters?
---
Sorry I am just used to some game subs being echo chambers that blow issues over the top, 76 is justified.

Just hopped back on since u18 and I just bought a bunch of mounted plans real cheap from vendors. What's the chance that's all duped? (I know I won't be banned)
---
Oh, my mistake. That sucks. 
---
Still. Not much longer now.
---
It means real money transaction
---
Not to mention radios and their 2 or 3 songs loop.

Happened to me last week, I posted about it running both dialogs (as I picked Raiders for my main) and he does the ‚Äúwe could have used those detonators‚Äù and then after 3 attempts he then wouldn‚Äôt let me pick the first one.  That said I saw it for two days and haven‚Äôt since

Yeah it's confusing, just wanted you to know it's a ways for the jacket haha
---
Hahaha, yeah I have mistaken it with bullion.

Are you mansplaining me? Ruddy cheek! I don't need to be a tart, I just know the difference between dying &amp; pleasure

I‚Äôll make it work. Thanks! It is at least staggered.

They did? Huh. Must‚Äôve forgotten about that. Certainly an odd decision.

You need 27k xp to unlock the christmas stuff. By the time you unlock the skeleton suit, you will still need 14k to get the winter suit. I wrapped up the rewards a couple of days ago and it took a long time to finish the christmas ones.

Added you

Nicely done. Do you have any budget yet for a patio gazebo in front of the vendors?

Amazingly written! Upvote for you!

Yeah, but now its hilariously easy to murder the entire area of Appalacha

You evil bastard. I love it.

Their lack of accountability is frustrating at best. I agree.

Have you participated in a Nuclear Winter match?

There's a weird bug when returning to Adventure Mode that makes it so every notification in the upper left corner plays a bass riff if a bass instrument has been played nearby.

That's what my friends explained to me, anyways...

Just craft em with super duper

Vault 76 never got wiped out by Enclave, Citedel mentions that they‚Äôre a control vault. Scheduled to open in 20 years. V76 waited an additional 5 years to open. 
---
What Vaults were made that were not sanctioned by Vault-Tec? Even Fallout Bible mentions there are around 122ish. 
---
Most people never knew about Enclave, even those in the army. Talk to Black Isle about that, not Bethesda. 
---
While a little bit of a stretch, Appalachia‚Äôs FEV is pretty cool addition that West-Tek continued experiments after government sent all main researchers to Mariposa. 
---
Brotherhood of Steel‚Äôs leader, Roger Maxson, used his previous connections to give many former troops a chance to join his growing faction. Showcasing how the BoS have so many locations and varied people. 
---
Let‚Äôs talk about all the disregards between F1 and F2:
---
The geography between one‚Äôs and two‚Äôs maps do not match up like they should‚Äôve. 
---
Jet being used by a Mrs. Bishop before Myron ‚Äúcreated‚Äù it. 
---
The Gecko species in general. 
---
Marcus telling us, pretty serious too, that Super Mutant ‚Äújuices‚Äù get flowing again. (Eventually, Avelone or Sawyer go on record saying it‚Äôs a joke)
---
F2 shows us Time-traveling to break the Waterchip. (Not the worst, but it was described as being too old not by Sabotage) 
---
There‚Äôs probably more, but I can‚Äôt recall
---
I can sell gatling plasmas, power armor mods, and the heavier bigger cooler plans easily, so pleasant hills cemetery drop site v9 the little camp with rocket machine in cranberry bog. All drop some good plans especially cemetery, i got 3 gat plasma plans tbe other day each worth atheist 1000 caps. And people will buy it right away 
---
I set my camp up at the cranberry bog right next to the train station  of watoga. Usually pretty busy but probably also why I don't sell plans causee there all high lvl that already probably have plans
---
Maybe we‚Äôll finally get those 20 atoms for playing 7600 hours
---
How do you get the train car? Is it from the atom shop and i just have missed it or is there any other way?
---
Yes. March to your own beat, or waltz, or square dance, whatever, it's your beat.
---
If you want, I just upgraded my rifle so I can give you my old Anti armor,Limb Damage, Reduced weight handmade.
---
"reasonable" we're dealing with (GOD)Todd Howard here, nothing seems reasonable..
---
I feel like it doesn't spawn at the dam anymore, the spawns there seem different and only the ski outfit shows up (I was trying for about a week before I tried a different spawn location and got the witch costume plan within a couple hours)
---
Doesn't reset for many, Bethesda will not fix the issue.
---
Hi, casual player here. I played WoW for almost a decade, this grind is worse. No way in hell I'd be able to do this without it being a full time job.
---
its actually not that bad.
---
what worked for me is to be on the outer ring when the fire starts closing in. as you make your way to the safe zone, you should see more enemies, and even more spawn later in the game. Was able to finish it in a match and a half doing this.
---
Just use a new email
---
I love them, finding their amazing builds has been the end game for me for a while. I don't find the grind for script, notes, score... fun. Did my daily loops and go camp hopping. Often my son would stand next to me looking at and commenting on their builds.
---
I have scriped so many bloodied /unyielding and bolstering gear that it is ridiculous.  I won't ever run a bloodied build so it's all junk to me.
---
 Just last night on one server I got 3 bloodied weapons in a row.  All 1 star but still I don't use it but the game still wants me to have it.
---
 It's almost as if they added an algorithm to give the player the gear they used the least.
---
great pics! what filter is that? I need it
---
OK that makes sense now, I hate acronyms üòÉ
---
Damn,made me do a double take at how dumb I was being. Hell I've done that 3 times already but cause this challenge didn't say craft or scrap I didn't make the connection. Thanks for bridging the gap friend
---
Iirc I bought mine from the robot vendor that sometimes random spawns near Charleston station.
---
Maybe people get confused because you need the fixed, bear arms, sheepsquatch plans, etc
---
Lost 3500 this week.. Got a sorry from customer support.
---
Instanced camps, no idea what that will entail. But given that it will be an instance it will likely have a larger build limit.
---
Well then you‚Äôve probably bought duped plans and legendaries from player vendors...
---
Yeah it was a console message
---
Yep, sealed up all the doors. You can PA glitch inside the structure, but you can‚Äôt get in the cell. I just need to find a way into the cell
---
Moved to C drive and automatically worked. Thanks!
---
2 things you can do
---
1-buy it from someone (if you're lucky, thats what I did)
---
2- I believe there is a random encounter corpse with the plans-I've only heard rumors tho
---
One question, is there a new option added to buy 800 atoms? 
---
I'm just seeing the usuals, 500, 1k, 2k and 4k. Maybe I'm looking somewhere else.
---
there's a ranger tower (done up with halloween decoration) that usually has one there (at least the hat). could also check Freddy Fear's and/or Whitespring (kids store)
---
Saw in another thread moving to the drive your OS is on fixes it. I just moved it  to C and now it's working.
---
I had a mothman conversion centre. In the most mothman-y room was a vendor with 30x lv50 cultist blades for 1c each
---
Figured people that made it that far to join the cult could have a memento to wave around.
---
Stopped bothering when a level 120 just bought all of them.
---
Ive had the opposite experiance.   I was in defiance.  And the i was helping a high lvl fight ghouls.   And a bunch swarmed me and just shut the door and left lol
---
Play the game you want. Is what I do. Iam level 86 and I didn't even started main quest. But in already in mire rocking with my plasma trying to figure out how to get more ammo for it for this 3 star beauty ( my only one tbh).
---
I don't even car about grind, just go to place and find legendary enemy occasionally to get these purveyor scrap points.
---
I wasn't even in settler city or received gold bullion (got it via challenges lol )
---
It's like you set your own goals at your own pace. Dunno I play it just like fallout game. Wander around and into public events. And my daily challenges get done.
---
People just get too stressed about this whole grind.
---
you do get the little slocum joe clock and a ‚Äúhave a great day‚Äù and ‚Äúhave a nice night‚Äù mural.
---
i was sad it wasn‚Äôt automated based on time
---
Metrics...this is pushing the NW player engagement stats way up, this can be used to prove how much Fallout 76 fans enjoy NW.
---
'We listened to the community'.
---
Higher ups in Bethesda/Zenimax need to know this.
---
(they pass out, then spawn way way off in cranberry bog)...
---
It includes everything in the item description, yes.
---
Downy piper
---
Even for all of them its overkilk.
---
find where they CAN spawn and go there. It they're not there you change servers. Rinse and repeat.
---
The description tells you what is included. I know the clock is in there and is listed in the description. I don‚Äôt know what mural you are talking about. There are a couple signs included.
---
I know this likely isn't a popular opinion, but while I see your point, I enjoy owning something that feels exclusive.
---
I want to do a survivalist RP, only use what you can craft (pretend that food, meds and weapons aren't abundant) , no "magic" weapons, armour or perks.
---
When (If) They do eventually fix this I am going to feel so powerful, I have gotten use to my first hit missing every time as a sniper vats crit build.
---
I like this idea
---
Just happened to me a day ago. Was at max level on radiation rumble with less than a minute to go. Game crashed
---
This is the fallout version of the bowl on candy on the porch on Halloween, with the note imploring teenagers not to take it all. I
---
1 xp per point of damage would be good, it would make fighting at least somewhat worth while rather than winner takes all
---
Surprised this has no "BuT Im A rAiDeR" replies on it.
---
kinda. it still happens to me,but nowhere near as often as what it used to
---
So at level 328 I will have six active rank 1 cards.  That is 6 more than what I have now.  If I can level up two cards to max that is still better than where I am at with none.  I don't think the developers expect you to rank up all the cards.  My glass is half full.
---
I‚Äôve had success with VATs in PvP recently. I think it‚Äôs just buggy like it is in PvE. Sometimes you might have to exit and re-enter VATs.
---
Even a hunting rifle doesn't get double. The extra shot adds 25% damage. They nerfed it down from double damage very early in the game
---
While they are at it make it happen for the WS bunker and the purveyor as well.
---
Already gave up the SCORE grind, as I'm on vacation for more than 2 weeks this season and will even miss the double score weekend.
---
I was excited in the beginning as it felt like a new way of progression, but the rates are just terrible and together with all the other grindy features (all features in this game) it just burned me out.
---
I'm now absolutely demotivated to play fallout 76 at all since realizing how unrealistic it is for me to get close to end-season rewards. There are too many crappy rewards on the way anyway.
---
a 3 second loading screen. OH THE HUGE MANATEE! Literally unplayable.
---
Afaik the players in F76 are chill and play with their own pace, at least that's the case with most people I've met. Most will never even reach 200 lvl. I've spent 600 hours and went up to I think 170 or something. Unless you make it your full time job you won't reach 500lvl easily.
---
I mean yeah they should feel legendary so that you can't just max 5 of them outright but it shouldn't take 1500 hours to max a single one.
---
Bethesda: "Oh, sorry, we thought you meant pioneer scout camp. So anyway, that's where you spawn, regardless of previous action."
---
I have burned out as well. Been playing minecraft for a couple days now. The motivation is just gone since since realizing that it's virtually impossible to get any end season rewards as I won't be able to play for a couple weeks over the summer. I guess I have better shit to do anyway than doing my daily chores in fallout.
---
what the hell is this dog shit complaining? You are complaining of 150 scrip a day, I am lucky if I can get to do dailies from my internet connection. And as you said,"which won't affect the gameplay much". Also those level 500s you see have the same struggles you do, and I don't see any of them complaining about how they have to grind; more of how the game needs to be fixed.
---
Yes, correct.
---
But the difference is: fornite is a battle royale focused game with a battle pass. Fo76 is an open world game with a battle pass? Plus fornite battle pass are usually a joke while in this one i see there is actually a legendary run. Like a freaking rat race that no one ever asked for.
---
Oh yes this happened yesterday for me. 
---
I started putting 5 of each nuka in my vendor for free and put up a sign that said plz take 1 for free. 
---
Ofc someone comes by and takes all of them. I will
---
No longer be doing this. I simply don‚Äôt think they can control themselves OR they could very well not understand the English sign I put up. Who knows. Either way I‚Äôll keep on finding players personally if I wanna be friendly.
---
I ended up buying my plan from another player last year for 2k caps. If you're on ps4, I can make you a few costumes for free.
---
It‚Äôs in the same place, but you may have to scroll down. It‚Äôs where you can get the Raider or Settler bundles. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
That doesn't sound like griefing imho.
---
I agree with a lot of this post. The end-game ‚Äúgoals‚Äù that players set can become easily lost from view due to the ridiculous currency capping that they keep instilling in their games. I can understand why bullion is locked to a certain extent, it‚Äôs a precious metal, rare, you can get tons of great stuff with it etc but legendary scrip being limited to 150 is one of the stupidest things to me. Why have purveyor sales which promote spending scrip when it takes me days to even get max scrip anyways? It‚Äôs just a stupid system imo, at least let players farm and be able to sell off their rare items without a cap.

This also worked for me after trying everything else. Thanks

Every clock in the game is stopped based on the time the bombs fell. Same with all modern Fallout games. They are all stopped on the same time.

Every Tuesday at 12pm EST. (:
---
Oh, I see. Thank you for the info. So it must rank:
---
Two-shot, Exploding and then Anti Armour for effectiveness?
---
Yes, at level 328 you will have 6 active rank 1 cards. You probably also have enough spare normal perk cards you arent using to scrap in for coins, and will be able to rank up 1 or 2 of the legendaries
---
Honestly, you will find out that levels 100-300s arent actually the best. Not everyone can be the best. There have to be bad ppl aswell and there are.
---
Can they assimilate the giraffe?  Not looking for judgement here.

We do not all hate trap camps. I love dying in traps. I always message the owner with praise. They're free raider content. Thank your local trap camper.
---
Well there is a grind for both gold for endgame loot. But it really isn‚Äôt that bad. You don‚Äôt need to be worried about high level players killing you as pvp is basically nonexistent and pacifist mods exist.
---
Basically this. It really isn't hard to grab an alt and use it as the source for challenges like that. 
---
Not to mention if you've got friends you can basically help each other out via trading or however else you wanna play it; be it through trading ammo and supplies or just simply asking your friends for a favor so you can load up your alt with a couple thousand rounds and have it there for easy leveling via events and whatnot.
---
It‚Äôs not just chores unless all you do are the season challenges. Those are bonus content, not a primary objective. 
---
And no you won‚Äôt get murdered. Griefing is almost non existent.
---
Place a fast travel mat where you want to land
---
Similar thing happened to me.
---
It started when was helping defend a workshop and after scorched kept swarming the place and i stayed for exp and the owner started throwing the angry emote at me and i was genuinely confused but i stayed cause i had a chance of pleasant valley tickets and he got to the point where he shot me which the pvp thing came up and i blazed him with my quad tesla and the turrets and didnt steal his junk and then wrote a message on a bill board saying 'please leave and an arrow' i then join his team and wrote on the bill board 'its a public workshop' and he replied with 'no it isnt' which i replied with 'it is' which smart alec decided to put a n't at the end. I just lost my rag and popped the stealth boys and raised his workshop to the ground with an explosive minigun.
---
p.s the log cabin looks really cool when its destroyed, just a quick note.
---
for the first 15-20 hours you will have more than enough fresh content to do, however once you have completed it all the endgame will be a bit grindy. But if your looking for something fresh there is a lot of content to do for a new player
---
It would be less of an issue if the legendary perk cards were ACTUALLY legendary. None of the perks truly have that game changing effect like something you would call legendary that takes 1500 levels and a bunch of the 104th new currency item that is also a huge grind.
---
Or find someone to craft them for you
---
I've just been starting a new character every few days.  Takes 5 minutes once out of the vault to gain a level. Next couple days do the easy responders stuff in flatwoods and try to see if you can get the responders fireman outfit.  Quick levels from those quest anyways and a chance at a rare outfit. 
---
Because yes, at level 260 something it takes a lot of grinding xp to level up every single day.  Don't really have enough time during the work week to realistically level my main up daily.
---
I split my time between making weird builds and role playing them to see how people react 
---
personally I love how people reacted when they met my friend (strait jacket and hooded mask) screaming for help some crazy man is after him then seeing me walking up in a nurses outfit (male character) informing him he was not well and his delusion of thinking the world had ended needs medical attention
---
As a man who has repeatedly played FO4 out of boredom, I've been playing 76 for a couple of months now and it's been pretty refreshing. It's been repetitive at times but it's enjoyable and since they've added NPCs it seems way better. I've come nowhere near beating the main questline or the wastelanders questline, so there seems to be plenty of content to keep you busy. 
---
Overall, I really like it, so I would suggest checking it out. Plus the world is beautiful.
---
Still works for small ballistic guns.
---
[Jeff Gardiner, Project Lead](https://twitter.com/jg93?s=20).  If you've put the years in, you'll know that 'shit rolls down hill' from the top.
---
Definitely. The planned mechanics to max just one legendary perk out is pretty ridiculous; in fact that's my primary gripe and I'm glad it wasn't released as planned for this season.
---
I'm level 283 and personally welcome the increase of XP needed for each level, the increase goes all the way up to level 999, after that it stays at a fixed rate.

Let me check again, I'm on PC
---
Community event to build Vault City when?
---
1. All Bethesda games will always be buggy so yeah there are still bugs.
---
2.  End game is definitely a grind.  As for the chore part most games I have played require you to do some kind of chore to receive a reward.
---
3.  If you turn passive on and don't take any workshops you should never have to worry about PVP at all.
---
You won't be butchered by high level players. PvP in adventure mode is very rare and this is probably the kindest community in gaming. The game is still buggy and some of the bugs are hilarious. As for the endgame, the grinds are just something extra to do after you finish the main story. You don't actually have to do them if you don't want to, but there isn't much end game content other than that.
---
That entire first "Featured" page is available w the bundle, so the clock is included. His little eyes bounce back and forth lol. 
---
As for the mural, I didn't check for the mural &amp; just used the free one. I'll double check though! 
---
Tbh, its a solid bundle if youre into vendor/restaurant camps. I do not regret picking it up. If youre on PS4, you can come see what I did w it if you want an in person view of the items.
---
Open the door, read the feedback, close the door, message passed.
---
The end game is grind, but if you like you like it. But all the new stuff since wastelanders makes you actually do stuff and go places. I personally think it is becoming what we wanted more or less. Rather less i guess because of ptw if you miss to collect score but overall i think it is not bad since i started over a year ago.

I felt the people who had become ghouls in the mission with the pyrolizer was really dark - bunch of free states cornered their friends and family members who became ghouls and just gunned them down while they were yelling back they weren't feral and to just leave them alone
---
Dude, Yes. It would also help other players (and myself) have areas that they mark as potential camp sites
---
Tbh I can't wait for that. I'm hoping the interior size will be customizable.
---
I think it's a matter of people just being limited by time at this point and being afraid that if they don't finish it now there might not be time to do so later; imo this has always been a case with something like what we have now; Warframe nightwave missions and dailies come to mine for me back when it was still fresh and before the catchup mechanics were a thing. I stopped playing about 2 years ago, I haven't really enjoyed it as the playstyle became stale to me. I'm not sure why it did, probably because I didn't really grow up with it like I did with fallout :)
---
If you are looking for level 50 stuff learn the spawn locations in Watoga and check them all then server hop and do it again.  There are like 3 or 4 suits that spawn there.  Should only take 1 or 2 hops to find a full set.
---
If you haven't done mayor for a day yet it is a pain in the butt from personal experience but still doable lol.
---
Yeah, steam probably makes a killing during their sales.  It's not 1:1 but it would be similar strategies.  There have been many times I see a game and think it looks fun/good but I won't buy it, then I see a sale and it's hard to pass up
---
Same I'm 86 and it I'm always worried about my junk after every event or workshop
---
&gt;Still buggy?
---
Yes, but not gamebreakingly so, and certainly not as bad as people make out. 
---
&gt;basically chore simulator
---
Whilst end game is very grindy, there is alot of gameplay to get there. If youve enjoyed replaying FO4 so many times you'll enjoy the single player story line of this enough times to get your money's worth.
---
&gt;will get butchered by other players
---
You can 100% avoid this in all situations except for workshops. Every other aspect of the game can be completely PvP free if you want it to be.
---
Killed one 1v1 it was a fucking experience. Now its in my display case.
---
i just started playing so this thing is enjoyable to me as well, i know how unlikely it is to finish and i don't even care and i love it.
---
I've seen two only since upping it to 10%. In one of those instances someone decided to drop a second nuke when the map was full of people killing it.
---
If you decide to play what platform will you be on?  I can hook you up with a level 5 two shot explosive pipe pistol if your on xbox.  You might wind up killing yourself a few times with it though.
---
Found it! Thanks
---
I'm happy to say I got it last night around 7 PM CST! From what I looked up, it seems as though the past few patches come out on Tuesday, so I'd say you have at least until then. But you never really know and that can be stressful. Good luck! I hope you get it too!
---
Gotta agree with this too; I never enjoyed the "pay to skip grind" in events such as this one in any game; I recall csgo did this with their shattered web operation, and man, it was kinda mediocre. They offered "discounts" when purchasing bulk stars (what you needed to advance the rewards).
---
Because it's forced. That's the issue with all this grindy shit.
---
You're forced to go out of you way, to do daily chores, just so you can experience the new content they're adding. And then in the end there is no content as reward anyway. Like the gold bullions... You grind daily for so many weeks just to get your nice gauss shotgun or full secret service armor, but once you have it, what can you do with it? Keep grinding? Grind SBQ for more legendaries you don't need? 
---
Fallout's endgame is essentially "Grind to keep grinding" and Bethesda abuses this to manipulate into logging in daily so they can sell more shit via the atom store and extend fallout 1st subscriptions. It's pretty obvious. 
---
The grind is Bethesda's interpretation of content. They're keeping you busy with work that may not fit your playstyle at all, just as an excuse for not knowing how to actually add more replayability to this game.
---
I think they're too much driven by short term financial gains instead of thinking about how to increase the quality of life for their players and make their game actually more attractive to keep playing to make it profit in the long run. It's just so stupid because they're hurting themselves and the few players that still have so much hope in this games. 
---
We all see how good this game still is and could be besides Bethesda's constant sabotaging attempts, don't we?
---
At least this latest 'Bethesda Stimulus Package' will bring a sense of normalcy to the prices for some time. It was beyond ridiculous for quite some time to have people asking thousands of each flux (also duped by the millions on the last 'Stimulus Package') for any Fixer or Handmade with FFR or Explosive effect, and a single good legacy wasn't enough anymore when trying to trade it to one of those awful Red Asylum outfits...
---
Same! Hopefully they bring them back someday in some capacity.
---
I like that answer lol. Gotta make our own lore sometimes.
---
Nah, I'm on PC. Yeah explosive guns are fun, in FO4 I used cheated explosive 7.62mm rifle and died from it few times lol. Thanks though
---
If you finish the original storyline, Wastelanders and other smaller quests that have been added in 15-20 hours, you're rushing through things and running from quest marker to quest marker without looking up. Those who rush through without reading terminals, notes or listening to holotapes are really missing out on a story told at a time in the Fallout history that we have not experienced before.
---
I haven't played much Warframe but I remember it was quite boring where enemies offered 0 challenge and you went through same hallways .(back in time when that twin tail Chinese frame was released)
---
But tbh it would be cool if you could complete current season "out of season".
---
As a level 400 I have no troubles at all getting my 3 levels per week. Actually have no troubles getting the one a day.
---
 My OP gear makes up the time spent gaining xp.  I can one shot everything so I fly through XP.
---
&gt;
---
As well here is problem with SPECIAL points, imagine how much effort you need to get 15 points at level 200. If you want to rebuild at this level - better create new character
---
I personally have over 100 perk points saved that I haven't used.
---
Ahaa, I didn't know about that, thanks
---
Go to Camp McClintock  - there are plastic crates on the floor full of clipboards (which give screws).   While you're there, walk around and pick up all the military ammo bags for ballistic fiber - because that's way harder to get than screws.     
---
Also Sugar Grove, which was already mentioned.  Lots more clipboards / desk fans / and some typewriters.
---
They said that payed fast travel to the crater and foundation was a bug and that they will make it free soon. Look at us now.
---
Those Chally items are adorable. I'm also loving the Quack Doctor and Mothman hunter outfits. The Grelock stuff is neat. That Blood Eagle nest is really dope. I'm 100% that bunker will be exclusive to another communist bundle.
---
yea sorry for inaccuracies in time, the last playthrough I did was as a person that had already been through most of it before and already knew the whole story. So I could definitly see it going for longer
---
&gt; Actually have no troubles getting the one a day 
---
How many hours do you need?
---
Again, legit player fucked while cheaters get rewarded.
---
Agreed. Made a normal jetpack at first, then bought a free states one, had to remake it. They did a similar things to backpacks, so they can do it.
---
Same lmao. I'm kinda j chillin here. Idk why anymore.
---
The atom shop.
---
I see the 200/300/400+ players walking around and can only respect the time and effort they put in. Achieving that status should be hard to get to, and it means something. It‚Äôs not happening for just any old casual player, and that‚Äôs the point in my opinion.
---
Ah, that makes more sense yeah.

---
How many hours have you played this game for?
---
The problem with that method is that not everyone has Fallout 1st so the Private World method doesn't work for everyone.
---
That's really my favorite thing about the game and the thing that keeps me playing. I can play it however I want and still enjoy the world.  I'm not really caught up in legendary run thing but I still enjoy slogging around through the environment and building out my character and base the way I want.  This game is stress relief for me not a really defined goal.  Of course I have my complaints, however the fact that I can continue playing an online game and continue enjoying the world is a first for me.
---
I‚Äôve never had that much of an issue with vats rng up until 76. As a stealth crit spam build it happens too often that I miss 99% shots for it to be intentional, but instead of this and a fix for rubber banding health (that was in the game since launch) they add a stupid battle pass with the same objectives that we had for years.
---
I am in almost the exact same situation. I got 76 after the free weekend, though I never got 1st because it seemed like a massive ripoff and I like playing in populated servers anyway. But everything else was pretty similar, I even use a rifle sneak build. I login to do dailies and run around for a few mins just so my shop is up a bit longer, but often half an hour in total. 
---
I just feel like they put in a bunch of secondary gameplay, but seemingly forgot to include the primary gameplay elements that those ancillary features are meant to support. Like, I get it if they don't want people to just grind max gear all day, maybe it's meant to be more like you play for the gameplay rather than the reward, but like you said it's busy work with what feels like arbitrary and artificial limits. I can also see them not wanting people playing 20 hours a day, and it's meant to be more casual or something. IDK, I just feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to comprehend their decisions, but chances are equally likely that the limits are in place to prevent the engine from exploding and bogging down servers or w/e. 
---
Or maybe the limits on everything are so low simply because it will mean people have to login more days overall to get whatever they want.
---
I feel like those Rockstar fans who complain that GTA Online hasn't had another DLC in the last month or two are so spoiled.
---
The most horrifying thing to me is what sounds like her accent coming and going as the story is told.
---
Idk if it actually *happens* but it just sounded like it to me.
---
Super duper works when creating legendary weapons that need modules (like gauss shotguns). I've made multiple today and super duper has popped
---
Perhaps maybe a decrease in scrip gained from using exchange machine after a certain amount of 1-3* being exchanged? A flat rate, maybe have something along the lines of at minimum after exceeding daily scrip exchange:
---
*: max of 1 scrip after exchanging 20
---
**: max of 4 scrip after exchanging 15
---
***: max of 10 scrip after exchanging 10
---
And that would be the lowest values, have it be a dynamic system where after exceeding 150 scrip these come into play that over each exchange decreases the scrip value until the player reaches the lowest maximum value they can exchange; that way people who wanna grind can grind with though a specific scrip limitation gain, while also giving benefit to those who grind alot of legendary items to be able to exchange them for scrip.
---
I know personally I've grinded at least 30 legendaries in one day, and I had to basically dump all * legendaries due to not having the room. Since then I've basically limited myself to keeping half a dozen ** junk legendaries for scrip and 1-2 *** junk for scrip too.
---
Why do people have to have an opinion on duping one way or the other? Whats bad about it? How does it change my experience in a negative way? I've never seen it as an issue, and if i ever did buy something that was duped it honestly enhanced my gaming experience. They balanced the game so mobs are bullet sponges without at least some god tier items, then they make those items super hard to get. You need the right piece, the correct amount of stars, and then the perfect rolls on each effect.   I should be able to get good rolls without fighting thousands of legendary mobs. 
---
I understand it sucks when the servers crash because of it, but it seems thats been happening less since FO1st came out. Besides the crashing, whats the issue?
---
Right. My thing is how are you going to pick a fight with a player 25 levels higher and then get angry when it goes south? Campaign for an ass whipping long enough and you may get elected.
---
i think they meant they wished it was one sign that alternated between "nice day" and "nice night" based on the time
---
Usually around 2.  I actually try to leave myself close to the next level the day prior.
---
Just started bout month or two ago.  100 percent agree.  I cant wrap my head around the daily limits for gold bullion.  There is so much to buy with it.  Have any figured out the math on how long it would take to buy everything with only receiving 200 gold a day?
---
Ah just the server error message that was actually the game not working if you don't have it installed on your primary HDD.
---
I haven't been back to see Reg since I completed that storyline.  Not interested at all in any of that stuff.  
---
SS armor still isn't good enough to handle nuke zone rads, which would be the only reason I would be interested in it.   And it's not like there's a difference in any of the PA in this game, the stats seem to be immaterial.     
---
I'm taking a break now until the BoS update and world rebalance.  Actual questlines (not dailys) and getting some sort of challenge back into the map will keep me interested in playing.  If that doesn't show up this winter I'll just move along to the next game.  This was a great experience up to the end of the main questline, so I definitely got my money's worth.
---
yeah, but its good for a little bit of treasury notes (if you don't already have like, 500)
---
At this point, it's not really their fault. It's our fault for expecting basic competency from Bethesda and Microsoft.
---
Fool me once; shame on you.
---
Fool me 112,376 times; shame on me.
---
Yep, it identical. Wiki shows XP that **need to next level.** For some reasons, it shows that from 1 level to 2 you need 0 points, when reality is 200, that's why my table have +200 points offset

---
I just recently bought the game and one of my biggest grip right now is the low amount of caps that we can sell stuff for at the non player Vendors, 1400 caps is way to low and i struggle with caps all the time it's actually making me not wanna play the game becuse i cant buy anything...
---
Gotcha...
---
I am glad I got the resolution fixed but no character/game sync (No Fallout 1st sync either) with the XBOX version, there may be near zero chance I play it on the PC.
---
Would be nice to reward us players who actually run around and gun. So if you get on my team don't get mad because I don't bush wookie it up with you as I have won more games playing my way.
---
I mean the mutual. It‚Äôs based on the one in vault 76 that will change depending on the time of day.
---
I was hoping it would say good morning from 6 am to 6 pm and then change over
---
You do not have to do the challenge. Nobody is forcing you. 
---
Repeat after me. 'I am a free Man! I can do what i want when i want.'
---
As someone who has a 2x max budget camp, even that amount of extra build budget seems like not enough. It‚Äôs plenty and doesn‚Äôt cause any issues, but there‚Äôs still so much atomic shop stuff that I wasn‚Äôt able to fit in. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it will ever be enough.
---
Hear hear.
---
I ran 8 matches in a row last night and got 6 animals (and 14 PvP kills.
---
Did not finish that daily..
---
I use fed76 to check weapons and armor to gauge pricing. Do you recommend anywhere to evaluate my loot?
---
Yeah, I only met one person I felt was a real hardcore grinder, and I haven't seen them online since Fasnacht. Everyone else, my IRL friend included, don't treat it like a job.
---
I'm not even 60 yet tbh, I'm only just rounding out my build, but I honestly don't feel like I have enough content to keep me interested enough to get to 100 or more, let alone 4500 for the 3 legendary perk cards that would fit in my build.
---
Yep, thanks for your suggestions anyway!
---
Great suggestion
---
I did manage to finish the daily.  It had nothing to do with skill and everything to do with luck.  Creature appearances are 100 percent RNG dependent. Simply put, I finished the daily because the creatures decided to spawn.
---
Haha they forgot to put a lock on the 2nd floor window of their house, it‚Äôs their fault I used that to gain entry and rob them!!!! I shouldn‚Äôt be arrested.
---
Twat.
---
there was another post about this, involving the wendigo colossus (the crocolossus)
---
Seems like nothing goes right with this game haha.
---
You'll use them eventually for something so not really a total waste.  Just stash them for later.
---
It sounds like your frustration is misdirected. I understand the frustration, but the CM are doing what they can. As others have mentioned, they can only relay player sentiment to the various teams. It doesn‚Äôt sound like they have control over what is focused on or finally addressed. And they can only share what is confirmed to them.
---
But I believe there is an effort to have more AMAs with dev team members. So maybe those will help in getting more specific answers to game concerns.
---
Learn the mechanics yourself first before you try to bash someone because you feel like it.
---
Explosives. I find using mines on them works well.
---
The dlc is incorporated into the base game, you can't choose to play with or without it
---
So, I forget to lock my front door when I go to work.
---
That means it‚Äôs totally cool for you to come rob me and you should face no consequences right????
---
It starts right in the beginning of a new play
---
Yes just wanted to give the links to people who are interrested in the subject.
---
The only time i enjoy NW is when I am sneaking around avoiding others trying to do score challenges. 
---
I got the 9 creatures in 2 matches. I actually won one of the matches barely trying. I am actually good at those type of game but I despise them.
---
That being said it wouldn't hurt my feelings if they did away with NW score challenges. Id be happy never playing NW again lol.
---
Fantastic considering that for most people Windows is installed on an nvme drive which is obviously the smallest drive in the computer.
---
I bought a years subscription and love it. I thought I would come to regret it and have buyers remorse but the scrap box, forward tent, and excitement of fresh infusion of atoms each month make it all worth it for me. If you don‚Äôt see yourself growing tired of the game it‚Äôs well worth it.
---
Okay Bethesda, when someone like me who hates Nuclear Winter and someone like this who loves Nuclear Winter BOTH say to remove the Nuclear Winter Score Challenges, it‚Äôs time to take a hint.
---
Yep 1-2 hours of playing and doing daily‚Äôs I get a level at 235. As you said having the right build and weapons so I can one shot everything helps. Do the teacup and one dark night and the one at the asylum where dozens of mobs spawn repeatedly and u soon rack up the xp
---
the proc sound is the bug. not that the gear isnt crafting duplicates, its deliberate.
---
i find the best way is to kill them before they kill you
---
(shoot them in the legs to cripple or the face to kill 'em quicker)
---
Also line of sight them
---
The one has nothing to do with the other It's a difference between being too lazy to fix a shitty ass broken game with an economy thats already worth nothing and breaking into a house illegally.You are kinda right by saying the option to do something makes people do it but like I said Bethesda isn't really doing all that much to fix tveir game so I dont see the point in banning people that use a "bug" to duplicate their items.And in all honesty this new dupe is really just another bug in the endless long lists of bugs in this game.
---
Yeah thats the case for me, I don't have space on that drive so im just not gonna bother and play literally anything else.
---
2, my main one is lvl 171, and is my main character. the other is lvl 20 and I used it to teach a friend the basics of the game.
---
At 400 level you need 64k points to next level, so 32k XP per hour. Almost 550 points per minute. Where you farm that much?
---
Grind alone isn't content. If it were no mmo would need patches and expansions. They would just increase the level cap.
---
Yeah I remember now; literally spamming two keys to jump through the level in 2 minutes. Short but really repetitive grind.
---
Side note; if you're looking for ammo, setup north east near the ammo factory workshop; it has a lead, junk and aluminum deposits; and just east of it a 30 second run you can setup your camp at a copper deposit which also has a small event area where you can farm faction rep from time to time when you return home.
---
Be sure to take advantage of Scrapper, Super Duper and Ammosmith! Scrapper to increase junk output from items,  Ammosmith for better ammo production per craft, and Super Duper gives a 30% chance to double whatever you craft!
---
At least, that's how I've been doing it :)
---
(And for plastic, go to the Morgantown high school, the missile silos also have alot of lead, as does the lucky mine.)
---
Bethesda game studios is different from Bethesda Softworks.
---
ESO was made by Zenimax and PUBLISHED by Bethesda Softworks. They never made the game.
---
AGAIN, this isnt the main studio, this is their side studio. The main studio is the one working on Starfield and ESO 6.
---
But you missed wonderful Appalachia without people :) Nothing less, nothing more :)
---
If any of you play on xbox id appreciate a helping hand btw :)
---
I only have baseball grenadess
---
no, it does not work on SS armor. i know damn well it doesnt, i crafted over 200 rolls, and not once did it proc. the perk is BLOCKED from working with and module gear. it was an issue dealt with in the PTS before wastelanders was every even released.
---
And Bethesda never made ESO. A simple Google search would tell people that. Bethesda published it but it was Zenimax that made it.
---
For that time the perk should be so legendary that you should be able to nuke unlimited times from your pipboy
---
Okok tyy ill try
---
It's sort of like Elite Dangerous, since especially early on in both you really had to make your own content.
---
Quite the opposite. AA will get you more damage on any enemy that has a lot of armor, so the more difficult baddies.
---
Their business model is sadly FOMO based. If things rotated in seasons they MIGHT be willing to consider it because a non-FOMO model just isn't something that makes sense to the brains of those in charge of money.
---
They ruined vending. Those presents give tremendous amounts of caps. Duping and using those caps to buy legit items is cheating and should be banned for it. I dont care about the plans in the presents, but the caps are different story.
---
Oh you have all the mounted head plans? And multiples of each... Hmm... HMM.... *HMM*....
---
The environmental storytelling of his body is even more tragic. There is a raider laying dead over a baby stroller, Bethesda can‚Äôt show dead children, but Colonel died protecting his child.
---
am i the only one whos gonna say he got the wrong vault number?
---
That‚Äôs just an Ignorant statement because if you don‚Äôt do them then you just don‚Äôt finish the season in time. You HAVE to do the NW challenges to complete the season, especially when they tie a weekly and three dailies to it worth a 1750 points. 
---
(Unless you plan on doing the repeatable 21 times to make up for it.)
---
There‚Äôs no freedom here, this season system is horrid.
---
So do I still follow the original Fallout 76 story that came with the game's release in 2018?
---
Vanguards
---
You keep everything. You just won‚Äôt have a private server anymore or be able to put anything in the stash box (make sure you fill it up as much as possible!) but yes, you keep the emotes
---
Yeah, I was really expecting at least one.
---
I have a feeling it's incredibly understaffed by incredibly new people. There is no way professional people cut mess up this badly over and over and over again.
---
I agree with this, especially about the perks. Wanted to change from a heavy build to a semi-auto one. not gonna do that.
---
Shouldn't they be fixing the game before adding new features? I can't get Daguerre because the quest is bugged.
---
Embrace NW the true cap free game mode
---
##ITS GRAFTON DAY IN GRAFTON
---
I was hoping for a Clean Bathroom Fixtures unofficial theme this time, but now I suspect we'll see a clean tub and clean toilet in the next 2 seasons.
---
I played twice last night and found only 3.    I lasted about 15 minutes or so. My brother shot 3.   So if I had been playing by myself I would have found 6.   
---
From playing other times it gets easier to find them as the ring gets smaller.   Also they  should show up as red marks on your compass when you get near them.   Tapping vats as you walk can help.   
---
There are other posts that explain good places to look.
---
Of course they have something to do with each other. 
---
Both are things you CAN do,  but SHOULDN‚ÄôT do, and can get punished for. 
---
Bethesda DOES try to fix these bugs- they‚Äôve fixed every one they‚Äôve found so far, people just keep finding new ones. 
---
You want to blame them for that? ‚ÄúHaha your shitty house is totally flimsy and easy to break in to, it‚Äôs your fault I keep doing it even though you keep blocking the ways I‚Äôve done it before!‚Äù
---
I think the lack of NPC's is what stopped me from buying it on launch (Or for the last two years for that matter!)
---
The longer you stay a live the more creatures spawn.  If you're in the last few circles you'll find a ton.   Didn't take me too long at all.
---
It's basically the same but more built up with npc characters to give you more information on what happened where.
---
Yes. There's just more quests added in so you might not do then in the same order you would have a year ago. But that's no big.
---
Are you able to unlock demolition expert? That should allow you to craft mines.
---
I've mentioned by a previous Ritter vanguard armor. You can read up on the stats for the different armors on wiki.
---
I think I wanna make a gun store now. Thanks for the inspiration.
---
(you mentioned displaying power armor. I had a power armor emporium in Fo4, can't do PA here yet so gunstore it is.)
---
Totally depends on your personal preference and playstyle. What one considers to be the best, might not be the best for the other.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
You remember when you where a kid and you ask your mom if yall could go to (insert favorite place here) and she says "I'll think about it". 
---
It's like that, a way to say no without saying no
---
I have played it like that, but it gets boring fast.  I am now level 75 and intend to reach level 100 to unlock all the cosmetics.   I eventually realized that reaching level 100 by bush camping alone would actually be more agonizing than just trying to get better at the game. So I started actually playing it for real and it's pretty fun if you give it a chance and work at it.    There are times when I don't feel like putting in serious effort, so I turn off the team fill and turn on aqua boy perk and hide at the bottom of Grafton lake.  That's not my preferred play style though.
---
Yeah I would like too know too
---
Nice!  Hopefully the first of many!
---
What special is it under?
---
Does anyone know if Electric Absorption works with self damage? Or damage from a team mate?
---
The card does not specify that it has to be an enemy. Just an energy attack. So I‚Äôm curious if an ally shooting with at you with a laser gun or throwing a grenade at your feet could proc it
---
It 2020 every major game Publisher build  games to make money now , you want passion look over to indies
---
Intelligence
---
Uhhhh..... Khakis...?
---
It does both of those things. It occurs when you have the healing Factor mutation for some reason. Removing the mutation makes the problem go away.
---
Take out one of their legs and they are easy peasy üòÅ
---
wait, is the stash box unlimited with fallout 1st or what do you mean? because holy cow I struggle with space management SO MUCH  
---
but thank you very much that's super good to know, I'll definitely get myself some fallout 1st soon-ish then :D
---
Nopee ty anyway
---
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
---
I would but I don't have 3 premade friends and there is no solo only (for everyone) mode.
---
yeah, It was my main source of atoms, wish they did both score and atoms, because there is no way im spending money on atoms
---
Yes it‚Äôs unlimited, put all your scrap in there, as much as you can before you lose the subscription
---
I propose the fun but extremely lore breaking solution of harvesting dead player DNA and bringing it to one of those cool institute synth manufacturers from fallout 4 to respawn killed allies
---
Okok ill try that any specific part of their legs? Like where there knees would be for example?
---
This is why I took the gold for myself.
---
Prior to legendary run I never bothered with challenges. Now I like coming in every day and completing the entire list as fast as possible. It is a little stressful to think about missing a day of challenges though. That's the only part I don't like about it.
---
I like that it trains me in NW. I don't enjoy the NW revive challenge. It's way too situational and might take lots of matches to actually accomplish.
---
Thanks, I wasn't aware of that. Mine doesn't do it.
---
Yeah but they aren't even dealing with those either and I'm sick of having to explain to idiots in threads why duping is wrong and why it affects everyone negatively and why it needs to get fixed so it's nice to discuss other shit for a change.
---
good advice, I'll definitely keep it in mind, again, thanks a bunch!!
---
BuT Im A rAiDeR
---
No problem
---
Thanks for your post. We've passed this on to the team.
---
I‚Äôm on steam and using the geforce also it didn‚Äôt work for me so I uninstalled going to give it a full day until installing again
---
Just removing the upper cap on scrip would be helpful. I'm at a point, because I have all Secret Service armor (so I'm not buying any legendary armor), and now one amazing weapon, with a few decent secondaries, that I'm not spending scrip alot, so I'm near max scrip so can't even exchange any more without buying something, which will likely turn into something I'm just going to exchange back (already have more legendary modules than I'll never need). I don't have the stash space to store any more or put any in my vendors, so I'm almost at a point where I'll be going back to pre-scrip days and just selling legendaries to vendors just to get something out of them.
---
Methinks Bethesda employees have sock puppet accounts here.  They  want you to skip the NW challenges because it means you will buy atoms.
---
Only thing that seems remotely interesting is the quack doctor outfit and maybe the blood eagles stuff...
---
Something tells me that chally stuff is gonna be the new rewards from Meat Week this year.
---
Use the Enhanced filter then play around with the strength, distance and range :)
---
I guess you misspelled Vault 79. But yeah. 101 forever! I mean seventy-sixers!
---
I can‚Äôt for the life of me fathom how anybody can get enjoyment out chasing rewards locked behind a game mode you simply detest. To those that do enjoy it, all power to you! I have spent my entire Friday so far hunting non existent creatures and I‚Äôm beginning to feel burned out with not just NW, but my FO experience this far. This is an ill omen indeed.
---
And why not?  Improvement benefits both seller and consumer.
---
You can literally drop penitentiary and get like 5 or 6 ghouls easily
---
So wait, is there cross-play? Sorry if that's a dumb question lol
---
Same I enjoyed the time around beta more but it‚Äôs still good
---
[Probably something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/atbMlnj.png)
---
might as well go with a mix unyielding and some bolstering. Just in case your health does drop it might just save your life. maybe 2-3 unyielding 1-2 bolstering and maybe a life saving.
---
I wish that the event completion rewards text wouldn't just disappear when you pull up your pipboy!
---
This. Also, events like Purveyor Sales that go from Thursday-Monday aren‚Äôt great either. I get that for majority of players weekends is free time and they get to make use of that but personally I get to play from Monday-Thursday and my weekends are taken up by spending time with my gf and child.
---
I get to play on the Thursday for the event, but then not Friday, Saturday or Sunday and by the time I finish work on Monday evening and get home the event is over so I only got to spend one day in the sale period and I‚Äôm burdened with a 140 scrip cap. Pain in the ass really.
---
Gotta ask, did you pick up the mask?
---
Not at my PC at the moment but theres a perk card under perception that lets you target specific body parts with VATS.
---
That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand, this game is meant to be a grind, I don‚Äôt get why we have limits on things?? There shouldn‚Äôt be a limit on caps, gold or scrip. There shouldn‚Äôt be a limit on anything in a game that‚Äôs focused around grinding and RNG
---
Wish I had known that. I did finish the daily but it was all random.
---
I saw someone sneaked in gold vault. we need to find this way too. otherwise its "exponentinal" absurd
---
I mean I prefer going solo
---
I make less mistakes and being by myself means less attention being drawn to me
---
I usually win more solo games because it's more likely the scorchbeast targets another team, and that's a great distraction while I chuck a few grenades to victory 
---
That, or I just spawn some trap bases lol
---
That is the mindset of the civilized help others so they can enjoy the game as much as we have. I love to help my fellow Appalachians.
---
I love that, unless I missed reading it, this wasn't in any patchnotes?
---
Sure am finding it annoying going to claim a workshop and then its already claimed.
---
No, not the stash is unlimited, you get a scrap box that is unlimited but you can only put Junk in there and it‚Äôll immediately get scrapped
---
On a full bonded events team I get around 1500 xp per event.
---
 Super mutants and ghouls can give me up to 100-250 XP per kill.  Every enemy in the game except for bosses die with one bullet so I can fly through any area fast.
---
West tek, harpers ferry (above and below), whitesprings ect... Any place with a high amount of enemies works.
---
 Add on a couple xp buffs.
---
I don't really pay full attention to that kind of stuff but I do know I level up at least once or twice a day.
---
I was over level 200 before using mutations too haha
---
No, the game came out for free on Xbox game pass, so there is a ton of new players on Xbox now trying the game out :)
---
Why play? Because the gameplay is fun. Not everyone needs to chase the carrot. Some people just like to run.
---
the headlamps are by far the stupidest thing in 76 cause when you turn on the light the source is actually at your feet not your head
---
I'm not for this every being answered, because it will literally lead to someone, not you specifically, but someone, using that information against them, and to try and harass them. 
---
Sorry, but there are limits. And there are also legal considerations, about putting out information, that could, even accidently lead to someone's personal information being put out there. 
---
So the response they give is legit, about passing it onto the team. It's just that when you hear things enough, it starts to loose meaning to you.
---
But I don't detest the game mode. I enjoy playing it the way it was meant to be played. And chasing creatures is not what the mode is about.
---
So why is it important to max everything out right away? The level 300s would have nothing to do in a short period of time, especially with public group xp bonuses and then when all the enemies will scale to your level. I like that there's always going to be something to work towards this way.
---
I agree that it's way way too many coins though!
---
I'm assuming it because some people thrive off the validation that they are they the "best player" because they achieved "all the things". andI'm not saying there's anything wrong with wanting it all. I personally think its  a weird hill to choose to die on, though.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. When players from both sides of the coin start complaining, you better know somebody screwed up!
---
Well at least you know now, i don't doubt the challenge will pop up again lol
---
I agree that using rad-sponge is bad-mannered if someone on your team is not a full-health build.  Team medic on its own isn't a problem but it is when ran in conjunction with rad-sponge.  I don't run low health builds but I have friends that do and it is common courtesy to not run rad-sponge in a group with them.   It takes 2 seconds to be courteous of others and look at your groups health bars and adjust your perks accordingly.
---
It means nothing since the team seems to not play the game and it allso seems that they can do only 1 thing per month.
---
As an extra option I've found it's handy to have some specialist stuff like ghoulslayers or troubleshooters.  Obviously they have limited use but it's nice to be near immune to turd bois and dominators.
---
I'd love this.
---
Also some PC users I guess
---
But I'm DaRtH VaDeR
---
HA! No. It's absolutely 100% pure fact. You don't want to do it. Then don't. You don't want to do it so much you wish they'd remove it. Simple solution just don't do it and those that want to do it will. 
---
Also your maths is just a tiny teeny little bit off there. You'd have to do 2 1/2 repeatables to get 250 points (not that you can get 50 points) NOT 21 times. I don't even know where you get 1 from. I can get 2 repeatables done without even trying in a very short time. One line in the sand gets me 10k xp without xp boosts on. 
---
Also if it makes you feel better. Some absolute madman already hit 100 by just grinding xp. Said it took 81 hours to do. 81 hours with only 1 lot of weekly challenges and 4 lots of dailies. 
---
SOOOO many people are gonna hit 100 with weeks to spare and i want every one of them to put their hand up and say 'maybe i overreacted when i said this was a human rights violation and the worst thing i've ever had to do!'
---
Oh I didn't know that.
---
head east
---
Ran it last night twice. No issues
---
Take the "Concentrated Fire" Perception perk, and aim for the legs. Once at least one leg is crippled, then go for the head.
---
I'm level 120 and I mostly try to avoid Assaultrons still though.
---
Super overpriced imo. I would say it is worth paying for once and sticking up on as much scrap as you can during that month.
---
That's all I'm asking.  Thank you.  Team medic on it's own is completely fine.  It's the combo that hurts.
---
Nice and ty for the list, this is a good service for those of us attempting to plan our Avatars before this comes out.
---
Grind = having something to do.  Before watselanders and seasons I would get on and do my 150 scrip and farm a few legendaries and get off.  Now I can earn gold bullion and score points.  If you don't like grinding then might i recommend a different genre of games other than MORPG?
---
A hand with what? =0
---
I stopped doing it when I realized the weekly was autocompleted.
---
It will be a huge wasted opportunity if they don't do this when instanced camps are launched. One thing that stops me from buying anything is that I don't have budget in my CAMP. Give me an instanced camp and open EVERYTHING in the Atom store, I'll likely end up purchasing some atoms (something I've never done).
---
My missions and doing penelopes missions
---
Id say this is more of a PUBG clone. Ive had more fun playing NW than i probably ever had on Fortnite
---
Ohhh ok!
---
So I assume the scrap can stay inside the box even after the subscription ran out, you just can't put more in it?
---
You can get more than 150 scrip a day but that‚Äôs honestly a moot point to the bigger issue.
---
You may dance for all eternity, yes.

bill gates most favored book: how to lie with statistics
---
I don‚Äôt know if we can blame Bethesda for that. Very game in existence, popular ones especially, has grind mechanics. Either that or people quit right after the game finishes.
---
I mean look at how popular gta is. They don‚Äôt even make story content anymore, they just add new ways to grind for cash and thousands of players eat it up. The issue isn‚Äôt that Bethesda has extended their content through these activity-walls, it‚Äôs that they haven‚Äôt learned what makes grinding for new gear fun. 
---
It seems like Bethesda believes we love new content because how hard we worked for it, but rpg‚Äôs like FO76 are about how we can manipulate our stats and gear to reflect our own play style. Instead of making a grinding a lot of work for a single major reward they should be working on making less work for a lot of minor items that allow us to add another level of depth to our characters.
---
Totally agree with you!
---
A bigger issue for me is that whatever the cost ends up being, we won't be starting with a level playing field!
---
At the moment 2 characters, both at level 200 for example, will have different numbers of perks/coins to use on the Legendary Perk system when it launches.  You can't penalise someone who decided to move a few perks around or completely re-spec their character without knowing the future implications of doing so.  Neither can you penalise a player that has opened all their Perk Card packs as they earnt them, without realising that the duplicates would disappear, losing them a very valuable asset in the future.
---
This game had me so excited to try to build a medic, until I realized that 90% of the community is a bloodied build and do not appreciate that build unless just getting revived. Bethesda really needs to buff some other weapon types up so people don't feel the need to be bloodied builds to compete for high damage. Im not bashing on your choice of build, just appalled at how many perks are just not used because they have the ability to ruin a team members build.
---
FO76 = Value &gt; Values.

---
They also spawn around players as the circle closes, they're also tracked on your compass
---
I had a level 14 come to my camp and I made him a beast of a fixer and dropped him a ton of plans and legendary weapons I had. I hope that fixer serves him well in the wasteland
---
This shall help many players, I wonder if they did this because of the limit after level 50? Either way, I like that perk card.
---
I wish I could try this but I don't have enough space on my C drive. I hope they fix this soon, I was really looking forward to giving this game a try on PC.
---
I didn't like how many creatures you had to kill but I kind of see the point. By doing this (being a solo player without filling the team) I learned a new way to play.. Lingering near the storm edge finding npcs to kill which give pretty decent loot.  Doing that I actually managed to go in eventually and take on two players one after the other and had almost a full set of nuclear codes.
---
The other lock pick challenge taught me the virtue of learning where the locked safes are because they give such great stuff.
---
Welcome to fallout gacha mobile.
---
Maybe it could have a request tab aswell for those in search of items
---
So if you buy fo first for only a month, stuff that scrap box with all the junk appalachia has to offer
---
Nonsense. Bughesda is a 2.5 billion dollar company. Banning a group of people who is paying a subscription does not change that one way or another.
---
No. They will ban paying people just as quickly. Don‚Äôt sub to fallout first thinking you can get away with anything.
---
Okayyy thank youu :)
---
False.. World of Warcraft bans people all the time and you pay monthly. 
---
Look at all the Twitch streamer bans, and those people make Twitch a lot more money then $13 a month.
---
I feel ya. I regularly reach max caps and want to give low level players a chance to get some nice camp decour. So I go see Pendleton at Whitespring and clear him out of his resort plans. I‚Äôm camped near the wayward and price those plans dirt cheap. But sure enough, every time some level 300+ player comes along and scoops them all up. Most likely already knows the plans. But hell, it‚Äôs part of the game. So now I‚Äôll just not put them in my vendor and drop them randomly for lower level folks
---
Will do! Thanks for the clarification!
---
Players that have the stealth build going to love that Perk Card.  I have that build and it shall go a long way helping me.
---
Lol no it‚Äôs not true
---
I agree. My camp is just SW of Vault 76. I'm only level 19 but I've been setting out purified water, stimpacks, ammo, etc. I get a lot of heart emojis from the level 2s. I think it's a great way for us to welcome them to the community and show we pay it forward.
---
TBH, I was sceptical too, but the game was charming, at least for me, it was something different. The nights were darker and more despair, everything felt mysterious :)  
---
Piece of advice : Do not rush forward, enjoy the game, enjoy exploring, enjoy little sad side stories about people who lived there, because once you finish all of this, the game becomes such a chore to play.
---
I keep three sets.    Excavator (for mining ) X-01 and ultracite for going against high level events.
---
Nah, just the general area.  If you use VATS and even a single rank of the Concentrated Fire perk, you'll be fine.  They can still shoot the OH SHIT WHERE DID MY LIFE BAR GO face laser but it's easier to avoid.
---
Hasn‚Äôt been true on any MMO I‚Äôve ever played. Violating terms of service will get you banned regardless.
---
One thing that keeps me often from getting atom shop stuff, besides the real world cost/need to grind atoms, is both camp budget and what it actually looks like? I bought a bunch of Nuka Cola stuff when I was creating a Nuka Cola room, only to find out after buying that the signs took up way too much budget. I've also bought wallpaper and then hated what it looked like and never used it.
---
Now I try to find someone's camp who has the item before I decide to buy it (right now debating on the Slocum Joe vendor - doesn't really fit my CAMP but looks really cool), but when items are only available for sometimes 1 week, you don't have that ability.
---
your friend is trying to get you banned. Punch them
---
If it‚Äôs anything like the company I work for, the comment is taken back to development or tech to review and then immediately discarded there
---
Alrighty thank youuu
---
No, you can still get banned.
---
If you've paid for 12 months in advance, to save money in the long term, Bethesda's got your money now, so they've got nothing to lose by banning you. 
---
This applies even if you just pay monthly, they've still got your money, and can ban you before your month is up.
---
I had a guy join that was sharing sun kissed. Not cool.
---
Bruh I‚Äôve only seen one player over 1000.
---
Hang around named locations, have you been checking your compass? They're always tracked on there if they're nearby
---
You're almost describing nuclear winter.
---
The problem with survival is people get salty.
---
In NW, if you die it's "Damn! GG."
---
In survival, if you die it's "Argh! I'm going to rip your throat out, you m****f****!!!"
---
Or a history log.
---
Yup. Im pretty sure it wasnt until mods became available for PS4 that I could build a jukebox that played the diamond city radio station. if modders can do it then theres no reason bethesda couldnt. They just dont.
---
I‚Äôm with ya man, despite having no set ‚Äúmissions‚Äù Minecraft is so much more rewarding. I‚Äôll never understand the way they set up the SCORE system. It should have been like the recent NW challenge for the ghillie suit. Of course it‚Äôd be a little more involved than that but what I mean is, if you played your ass off you could get it in the first week. If you took your time, you‚Äôd get it nearer to the end of the event. Why wouldn‚Äôt they apply the same logic here? People who do their dailies/weeklies religiously for like 6-7 weeks should be able to reach the end, and then people who play less often/more casually, it‚Äôd take them til the end of the 10 weeks. The way it is not you could play religiously for 10 weeks doing every single challenge, and if you don‚Äôt do the repeatable 16 times each week on top of that, you STILL won‚Äôt finish! It‚Äôs unimaginable to me. It has completely ruined my motivation to play at all. The only thing for me to do is log on, do the tedious rep dailies, do the boring SCORE challenges and log off. That‚Äôs just not a well designed game. ESO has all these raids and shit that you have to plan ahead, put a team together, strategize over the mic. 76 removed the one end game dungeon it had and it wasn‚Äôt that great to begin with. The first mission was kind of fun, the other two were tedious and sometimes impossible due to lag, unresponsive controls and timers. I‚Äôve given up on score. There isn‚Äôt enough incentive even being a completionist to spend most of my time playing this game doing boring and tedious bullshit when I could be playing actually engaging, fun, interesting games, like Subnautica and my realm on Minecraft.
---
To my eternal regret!
---
Or go to a bench, or die, or go into VATS...
---
It means they will pass it onto the actual development team because their job has nothing to do with development. I thought this was obvious.
---
Haha, even that might be a little generous at times
---
BuT lUkE i Am YoUr FaThEr
---
There's no way to know if your camp spot is taken or not until you load into the world. I would suggest moving it like others have said.
---
At lvl 357, I run high INT and boosts, average lvl 68 warlord gives me 400+ xp. My INT is 41.  I can level up in one pass through Westek/DMV/Golf Course/Huntersville.  The Burrows and Harper's ferry are also good.
---
It's something to do yeah but not new content. I'm totally fine with grindy games but I personally get bored of doing same things over and over. It doesn't explain why I played the game daily before Wastelanders and then stopped but eh
---
Pretty neat!
---
At level 50 you have max SPECIAL, at level 500 you should be able to max legendary cards. Level 500 is already really high.
---
Apparently there‚Äôs some glitch for the raider rep where you spam some buttons. It‚Äôs annoying because I had to do it legitimately.
---
What platform are you on? 
---
I‚Äôm six plans from being at 100% myself, so if you are PC I can help you along a bit. I guarantee you that you are missing more than you think.
---
&gt; No company is going to ban someone from paying them a ton of money monthly
---
No company is going to allow 'bad apples' to shit up their games and ruin it for everyone else.
---
Incorrect, someone made a post doing the math saying to complete the season you need to do all the weekly and daily quests, and the repeatable once a day. For the 1000 from the weekly you‚Äôd need to do it 10 times, then to get the 750 from the three dailies you‚Äôd need to do the repeatable 8 more times, plus having to do it once a day for those three days worth of dailies that tacks on another 3 times. 21 times in total.
---
(And the only way someone is at 100 already is if they did that XP glitch thing, nobody legitimately is at rank 100 now. Even with stacking on Full Unyielding Armor, tasty squirrel stew with carnivore, and berry mentats, the repeatable only proc‚Äôd twice during radiation rumble for me after killing every single ghoul that showed up.)
---
I've been enjoying the free rewards, but I think it would be better if you could choose different tracks based on rewards you want. Only really want CAMP items, go for those. Care more about PA skins, that's what you are working towards. New player who wants to earn Perk Cards, Bullion, Scrip, and Atoms, perfect! Feel the need to have it all, just do one track after another. 
---
Personally I'm in it for the CAMP items, and really only want the fireplace door. Which means the full grind for me. But I don't think there's a single character cosmetic item that I am eager to get.
---
That's why you should spread yourself thin and do a little of everything at once! :)
---
best thing to do if you find yourself struggling is just to leave it for now. Go do events. Explore the map. Do some other side quests. There is no hurry. You need to be 50 anyway to get the best out of the wastelanders rewards anyway. 
---
If you use non auto rifles i could whip you up a couple of good guns with mods to help you out.
---
Congrats, you formed your own opinion in a game designed specifically so you can do that. The game‚Äôs designed so you can do pretty much whatever you want.
---
High hilarity factor, low negative impact (free fast travel to 76). I like it!
---
oh yes, so many fresh blood in the game. i tried to gift some of them a hardened pipe gun and some hundreds of .38 but most them ran away. later on, i realized, it could be the outfit. seeing a guy in a disappearing wetsuit, jumping several meters in the air wearing the fastnacht jester mask could be a little bit disturbing. i switched to the bathrobe with a chef hat and then they stayed. welcome to appalachia :D
---
&gt; It kills me that it takes so many screws to craft a weapon and it scraps to zero.
---
Huh, I didn't think about that, good point. 10 screws to craft a weapon and yet 0 returned if scrapped...dammit bethesda
---
Wish they remove the shovel
---
Yeah i now realize it would be impossible because of how you load into the server i guess im moving
---
Makes sense.
---
I can second this with stating I am at absolute max budget...yep. budget glitch only goes so far. I have an absolute complex above ground, and a full size 4 story underground PVP arena decked out. Still feel it's not enough. I even decorated and filled 99.9% of the area as well...FYI max cap is roughly 10x normal max budget.
---
Only Bethesda to make content that doesnt apply to the latest xpac, the ammo creator machine doesnt create wastelanders ammo(gauss weapons) and the purveyour events doesnt include stuff you use to create wastelanders weapons and armos. Its stupid AF.
---
Ah a little tip from someone who has done most of the challenges... for the mod weapons one, it counts if you just apply a skin and remove it over and over. Incredibly useful.
---
&gt; "also punishes players who played a lot with their builds switching stats AND players who lost lots of perk cards due to having duplicates." 
---
This is the biggest issue for me and has to be the priority before haggling over the cost of cards/upgrades.
---
When this launches it simply has to be a level playing field for all players and all characters.  If 2 players with characters of the same level don't have access to the same number of perks/coins, it's unforgivable.  You cannot penalise someone for something that wwas either out of their control (duplicate cards disappearing) and/or for something they had no idea would severely impact their character in the future (moving points).
---
‚ÄúA ton of money monthly‚Äù 
---
Exactly how much do you think fallout 1st is? üòÇ
---
Yeah it reminds me a little of the restoration potion glitch in Skyrim, fun for a little while but takes the challenge away
---
have you played a game called gta online on pc?
---
Have you tried altering some of the .ini scripts?
---
Or in GeForce settings¬ø
---
I mean, choosing to play something or not to play something is personal preference.  I have friends that stopped playing with watselanders because they took out vault 94, the only real end-game content this game ever had.  I also had friends come back with wastelanders.  People are going to stop and start playing for different reasons all the time and there is never going to be an update or change that makes EVERYONE happy.  I think we can say without question that Wastelanders was good for them for business so it is what it is.
---
All I've been using the week I've been playing the game is a double barrel shotgun and a combat rifle I have an smg but its not v good
---
Only 80 treasury notes? I'm at 400+ and need a mule for my legendaries in stash or my character cant move. Chore to the next level
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 116 and I did this at a workshop for a lower level player (helped them defend) and the person gave me a thumbs down for helping them. I was kinda bummed. It won‚Äôt deter me from helping though.
---
Stealth armor, and personally I use a gauss rifle
---
Okay but outside of those select live streams do they play the game like WE do? Because if they did they would see the same issues you keep seeing pop up over and over that need to be addressed and be bothered by them just as much as most of us are.
---
Yes they force people to play NW to show the execs "look how promissing our new game mode is". Its stupid for the players.
---
The constant misses on 95% VATS has been around for a long time. There's really no excuse for it, other than they simply don't care enough about it to fix it. The problem is, it affects just about everyone almost every time they play. VATS shots do a lot more damage than regular shots (for some reason), so you almost have to use VATS to get high DPS with most weapons. If they are going to push players into VATS like that, they need to make sure the system works properly.
---
Ill be there.
---
LOL yep, blame it on the internet...
---
its funny, I took this exact stance as I helped develop cheats for this game. 
---
I am at the point now where I seriously hope you guys at least use the auto loot because this game is such bullshit it doesnt deserve to still exist. 
---
wasteland 3 and cyberpunk are on the horizon. the newest hack program built by F76 users  is intentionally sandbagging itself so NW players cant use it to cheat. that's how pathetic  Bethesda is. The hacking teams will cripple their own exploits to not destroy the entire fucking game. Think about how fucked up that is.
---
On my stealth character I enjoy running around with Chinese stealth armor, a lever action rifle for long range and a fixer for medium/short range.
---
Combination of rifleman and one hand meele is not optimal. But managable.These are just basics you should have. The rest is up to you.[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c614158&amp;d=pd0pl0pk0s50si0sj0se2sg2ss2c72lu2l71lt2a00ao0ar2pp2](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c614158&amp;d=pd0pl0pk0s50si0sj0se2sg2ss2c72lu2l71lt2a00ao0ar2pp2)

Good to know! I'm assuming it works on pa as well?

How are you so poor? I made almost 30k caps by lvl 40 and I wasn‚Äôt even going out of my way to make money

Who? Look on LinkedIn there‚Äôs literally 1 dude responsible for all of the economy specifics. There‚Äôs a QA manager too. Idk why we aren‚Äôt calling these people out.

Todd Howard is gonna appear at your bedroom door with his dick out, ‚ÄúThe team passed on your message, what seems to be the problem‚Äù
---
It was honestly annoying because at that point I wanted to advance in Overseer levels to get access to other areas of the Vault, and it made it flat out impossible. It didn't seem like the match would even launch to a lobby until enough players were 'looking for match', so if there was a match already going, it could take even longer because that match had to bleed enough players to 'fill' the minimum for the next. Of course prime US gaming time it was easier, we would even sometimes get over thirty players in a match!
---
Thanks for the link, nice site you found
---
Completely understood.  I'd love to have a team healer really.  There is just to much incentive to run low health currently.
---
It is not true
---
People constantly complain that the only endgame is the SBQ fight but if you nuke anywhere else but prime fissure, your berated for playing the game wrong. I say we start nuking random places to find new content. Has this been done? Do we have proof that we've nuked everything? Don't complain that there's only one endgame event but feel the need to constantly repeat it. Do something else, don't burn out doing the same thing ever day.
---
Grab 5 100% limits money per day, not with a cap, but by making everything take forever. Want to do a mission enjoy flying across the map and back. Diamond casino same boring fetch quests across the map (unless you glitch it and repeat the ending).

&gt; What platform are you on?

&gt; I‚Äôm six plans from being at 100% myself, so if you are PC I can help you along a bit. I guarantee you that you are missing more than you think.
---
I'm on PC, codemonkey001. I'd definitely be interested in anything new you might have. I know I'm still missing a bunch; there are a few I passed up on (most I've spent on a single plan so far is 10k caps - much as I'd love gorilla statues, I'd prefer to finish out my mutation serum collection before dumping 18k caps on those). That plus I stopped playing for half a year before Wastelanders, so I'm missing some of the neat stuff that came out during Meat Week and other special events.
---
Do you remember where you got the plans for the fixer?
---
They should do. That's why I asked lol. No idea then.
---
This also.  Let me turn off shared perks too.  Maybe I don't want aquaboy.
---
Also made a post about the shop being really boring. I‚Äôm glad to see this got more attention tho!
---
My thoughts are exactly like yours! We all have those spontaneous moments of buying things because we saw something cool being done with it. 
---
Imagine if the items we wanted at the specific moment was actually available. I know I would spend every single atom ever earned. No doubt.
---
the heroes nobody appreciate.
---
Completely forgot about the gauss, might go for that once I build up caps
---
Spread accountability so no change ever comes - if you‚Äôve worked at a big company, you‚Äôll know this all too well. The machine rolls forward, the only thing it cares about is profit.
---
Wait wot
---
So you can just keep checking in a nuke zone every 15 min?
---
Us: This guy is straight up cheating and we have video evidence!
---
Bethesda: Yeah buy look at how much he spends in the Atomic Shop. He stays.
---
i found an easy way around the weight problem. I only carry what i need. Then when i run low  i make some more or buy it.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if Todd went out and murdered someone for the perfect recording.
---
I'm level 19. Using a Marksman rifle. Secondary is a sub nose 44.
---
$10 is a ton of money?
---
Yeah the plan is from the Encryptid event. But the drop rate is quite low. You can find people selling them sometimes, but they're quite expensive.
---
I think what might save some CAMP budget is to make special displays. Like the bobblehead display that is full, but rendered as one item that requires all of the bobbleheads to create. Or a magazine rack with all issues of one type of magazine, again needing one of each of those to create. You can already use aid items to build things in CAMPS (such as food), so it won't be much different. It would free up so much CAMP budget. Right now these can take up like 20 Flamingo Units each, which is a lot. I get that display cases with random junk couldn't work like this, but there's got to be some solutions to be had that won't break the server.
---
Of course but what I find weird is how me and my friends included, loved Wastelanders. The writing is best Fallout writing BGS have done, the skill checks are amazing and the story itself was interesting yet they all stopped playing :(
---
Or they look at that as some kind of evidence that it's easier to level than it really is and have no idea most of those players hacked it
---
&gt;drussell
---
Two toons.   However, I don't understand which math you're referencing.   What doesn't add up exactly?
---
Depends on what they do, duping wont get anyone banned, but some stuff is just off limits
---
That sounds like a statistic...  How long is your weiner? &lt;g&gt;
---
And this is because is so wrong. We shouldn't have to create a new character in order to grind stuff for the old one.
---
I afk all of my games unless my husband wants to play. I don't want to play BR, I've played enough BRs that I'm bored of it. I just want the cosmetics. I survive the longest and get the most xp from afking. ü§∑

Welp, I‚Äôve got nothing but time now. Thanks
---
I use a B 50 vats 15 vats fill Gauss rife, I used to use a Q 50 25 Gauss as a second weapon.
---
I feel ya dude, I'm lvl 17 myself and I have high level players helping me put all the time. It's really nice to see the community help us low levels out. Heck, I even had someone revive me during SBQ event. It was my first time and didn't realize what was happening so I got downed but some dude in excavator armor helped me up and plopped a tent down. I really appreciate you high level players. I wish the best of luck to you guys in your adventures through Appalachia.
---
The lever action or Gauss rifle are the best sniper weapons. Black powder weapons aren't sought after for snipers because no suppressor or scope, plus crappy range and as you said massive reload times. Black powder weapons are more a novelty.

Gauss Minigun - its got far better DPS and is not wholly dependant on the explosive effect for damage (FYI against the SBQ the explosive Gatling Plasma sucks). Only major impact here is that crafting ammo for the Minigun is far harder than the plasma.
---
Different objects have different values in the budget. A powered object will take up more of the budget. Try removing more things.
---
I have a basic handmade with silencer something with 1 * would be luxury üòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs well worth the 100$ I paid for it especially since I play every day. The tent I have set down at whitesprings station so I‚Äôve got free fast travel to a place I visit several times a day, the scrap box‚Äôs is a blessing and let‚Äôs me indulge in my inner hoarder from Fallout 4 by picking up ALL the junk. The 1650 atoms a month now are a real life saver if you‚Äôve completed most of the basic challenges, especially now since weekly and daily atoms were removed. Private world is amazing because everything loads much quicker and it‚Äôs far less glitchy and laggy, plus private worlds are great for hiding in when some new bug is going on like when people could steal your stuff through your shop and whatnot, good for bunkering down till it‚Äôs all patched over.
---
And the Ranger outfits and emotes are baller as f*ck, Nuff said. (The other cosmetics you get from it are also really good, I really like the Bog Wanderer outfit and mask, and the Atomic skin for the bland scout armor.)
---
Plasma cause it explosives rounds are op compared to Gauss

It was back in 2015-2016, I'm not lonely anymore (no time for that anymore being a father and husband) but thanks, if you ever feel like playing together with me and the wife on PC you should join us. My IGN is Tantrano.
---
We're sorry you don't like the bag, there is nothing we can do about it now, don't call here again
---
So the wooden one takes up less budget?
---
Then stop playing the game. Is this sub just a complaint column? Jesus, no wonder this game still gets shit. People can't enjoy what they have so far. 
---
I get what youre coming from, but holy crap does this game not sound playable how youre putting it.
---
Everything, that amounts way too much for the time frame you've owned the game
---
Bloodied Sniper, using BE Lever for main, BE Handmade for secondary, B 10DWA 10mm for weak mobs. All suppressed.
---
Probably because they don't like to grind.  There are A LOT of gamers who bounce between MORPG games when new story content comes out.  They pop in, do the new non repeatable stuff and then move on to something else til the next story content update.  It's been this way for years and there is nothing wrong with it.  Games have players who play them everyday and then players who come and go.
---
Ah that‚Äôs sad man. I feel for you... you even took the time to do it....
---
... must get rad sponge now
---
Dude I've been playing for _almost two years_ and I'm level 141.
---
It‚Äôs not hard to have two people disband a team and join another.
---
Stash limits, camp budget, a hard weight limit... these all exist to protect server stability.
---
FO 1rst allows for unlimited scrap. Not unlimited stash. Huge difference.
---
If you scrap 76 hats you get 80 atoms,I just made 76 cowboy hats and got it done
---
Spot on mmo chat.
---
I was a pure full health stealth sniper up to lvl 160. My main was a .50 hunting rifle, which was two shot until I found and instigating one. My secondary was a quad lever action. 
---
After lvl 160 I got a bloodied combat rifle and made it auto. Now I run a bloodied stealth commando, but still use the instigating hunting rifle as my main because it one shots most things and ammo is cheap and quick to craft. I'm looking for an instigating lever action to replace it now though.
---
It took me about an hour and a half to finish because I kept forgetting to look for things and kept fighting others LOL.
---
Damn if only I had any skins
---
I personally don‚Äôt like when high levels do everything for me and give me everything I could ever need.
---
Is this true? If we don't pass him we lose out on the rest of the rewards? That is completely fucked if true. I figured it was just a fun gimmick and if you don't pass him, you'll eventually just meet him on the final space and still "win".
---
Yup yup, works on armor too if I remember correctly. I think I did all of these back when meat cook was a thing, I got all of them done at once when I realized I could do them by applying skins.
---
Wow. How do you get 41 int?

"YOU'RE A LITTLE BITCH AND YOUR BROTHER WAS TOO"
---
Because the gameplay is fun you say. Do you not see duping erodes that gameplay? why do anything for a reward in game when you can just 'get it'. Suppose i am just out of touch. Used to be some form of accomplishment /reward for effort in a game was fun. I don't have these strong weapons, but I sure as hell don't want a duped/glitched one.
---
It would seem so. The frustrating thing is there's no numbered value for objects. You just have to experiment. And objects stored instead of broken down take up budget too.
---
Huh did not see that one lol will have to knock it out
---
Not after it has already failed.  From a business stand point, there is no reason to take risks on a product that has already underwhelmed and undersold.  
---
They can rely on people buying the next product the company releases based on so many factors that have nothing to do with this game, they've got absolutely no worry about how to coordinate their future.  They have people far more clever than all of us who know how to use marketing to manipulate the masses.  IPs like these will always have a devoted fan base to rely upon.
---
These people created something sub par and are doing with it what they need to so they can squeeze out whatever blood is left before they don't need to worry about it anymore, because everyone moves on, and Bethesda is very unlikely in a position to have to worry about one failed product that has probably already brought them more money in subscription costs than most other launches alone.
---
The real question is, and I don't mean to be so very obvious "tHeN dOnT pLaY tHe GaMe" about it, but you seem to have such calm and rational requests of the "team", why have you not rationally come to the conclusion that, if you don't like something, don't interact with it?  I get that you want to have the experience you were looking forward to, and that hasn't properly translated and someday you hope it will, but if you're not having a good time, why trudge on?  I don't mean that to sound so rhetorical, I'm genuinely interested in what motivates you to continue doing something you clearly aren't enjoying.
---
Awesome. Great tip thanks!
---
I never got the Fixer plans. I got the actual Fixer by doing a quest. There‚Äôs a poster you can read in a train station and it starts the quest. :)
---
No worries, and good seeing you, too!
---
I think most people are upset that it will change the landscape of the economy, mostly for people trying to trade up on the market sub. Other than that, it doesn't really impact anything other than maybe the pvp if everyone has god rolls
---
I constantly look at lever rifles, yet I have not found one to compete with my hunting rifle
---
&gt;No company is going to allow 'bad apples' to shit up their games and ruin it for everyone else.

This company kinda has ü§∑ those who participated in the whole gift duping fiasco went totally unchecked.

I‚Äôll give you gorillas, I‚Äôve got dozens. The folks charging for them are gougers, plain and simple it‚Äôs a 500c plan, max, given how duped presents were.

I‚Äôll PM you, we can coordinate getting together. I‚Äôll get you that missing armor piece if nothing else, but I imagine I‚Äôve got a bit more for you.

Another annoying thing is the fact that the keypad on the brick keypad door is on the wrong side... it‚Äôs been driving me mental

81 hours of doing nothing but grind XP with as many buffs as possible. With unyielding and INT boost from building teams plus lunchboxes and magazines and bobbleheads and perks and food and sleeping. There are so many xp buffs you can have. They were running westek (and somewhere else) and getting around 500xp per mutant killed. How many mutants are in westek and how long would it take a bloodied geared player to run through it? Only takes 20 super mutants to get 100 score. Probably getting 15k Xp per run and i cannot see a run taking more than a couple of minutes. 
---
Also i've seen about 7 posts all with completely different maths for finishing the season.
---
I personally never play NW unless the daily is so easy that I can‚Äôt help myself. 
---
This one I got tho. 
---
BUT I really do hope for all you guys that like NW that Beth will soon improve your experience! I can‚Äôt imagine how it must feel to be one of the PVP players that just gets regularly ignored in this game. More attention to you guys as well!!
---
I agree with this, and I don't judge you for buying things when you want them. That is the whole point of the game, to have fun.  If you enjoy finding something you want and just purchasing it, why not?  
---
I'd just add that IMO evant plan drops should be guaranteed to be something you don't already know, until you have learned them all.
---
So, just a heads up. My girlfriend is also playing 76 through Gamepass with the game installed on a secondary drive and it does not have this problem. The only difference we've had is that she had to create a NEW Bethesda account whereas I logged into an EXISTING one. Has anybody else CREATED one and had it not work?
---
They way the structured the game inadvertently made it ideal for the casual gamer. People like myself who dont get alot of time to play each day, 150 script and 200 gold fits in perfectly with the time I actually have to sit down and actually play. Anybody else in the same boat?
---
Unchecked cheating drives more players away than it retains.

If you shoot off both the arms they will explode... regardless of how much health they still have... if you run a shotgun with the enforcer perk it allows you to disable limbs VERY easily... take out the head first if you don‚Äôt wanna get laserd... sometime I get lucky with my double barrel shotgun and one tap both arms... then I just laugh at them until they explode.
---
The biggest issue is RNG. Me and a friend spent an hour for the kill 3 creatures challenge simply because they wouldn‚Äôt spawn. I didn‚Äôt even bother trying it again
---
Don‚Äôt wish that on him. He‚Äôs moving on to better things and breaking away from this grind-trap that Bethesda calls a game. Run, OP, don‚Äôt look back!
---
Ah there‚Äôs a few challenges going on in Nuclear Winter right now that rewards a pistol, rifle, shotgun, Minigun, and armor skin. 
---
(That game mode is pretty horrid though... I managed to get all the prizes by hiding in bushes for a week.)
---
Totally need to freeze. No point othercase.
---
So it's a bug.
---
So you want to speak to the manager, Karen?
---
At the end of the day, it makes people walk away and find more rewarding things to do with their time.
---
Ouu OK I never knew that ill see if I can get that perk thank youu
---
‚ÄúPlease take one bag of sprite‚Äù
---
Yeah, as long as the nuke covers an "Assault type" random encounter location, then you just go in and clear out whatever spawns there, leave and come back in 10 mins to see what spawns next, clear it out if no wendigo and come back in another 10, so on and so forth.
---
I'll just add, that just because you have a God Weapon doesn't mean you're going to get the most out of it. Meta builds like Junkies and Bloodied still require work and effort, hell any build does to get the most out of a weapon. This just levels the playing field a bit.
---
Also, I have a legit TSE Handmade from way back, I used it up until I transitioned to Bloodied about 2 months ago, but yeah, that's staying in my Stash forever, I'm not giving it up, so I know what you mean.
---
As soon as it was announced that this gun was going to be in the game my very first thought was:  "OK they are going to do something about the ammo then, nice!"  
---
Nope lol.  Just completely overlooked.  It's so absurd considering how much ammo that thing consumes.
---
My girlfriend's been playing as well off of my laptop. The game is installed on a secondary drive and it has no problems. The one primary difference between her game and mine is that, rather than signing in to an EXISTING account, she CREATED one through that pop up. Not sure if this ALSO plays a role.
---
They have:
---
"It just works"
---
There was a dup exploit going on recently and that usually involves creating lag on the server. I‚Äôve seen posters recently saying it‚Äôs been fixed however. Not sure this is the cause though. I‚Äôve experienced quite a bit of lag at times these past two days as well.
---
How?
---
I just rolled a new character and started playing and hit 35 yesterday. If I hadn't bought anything I'd have less than 6k caps.
---
The headlamp on the SS helmet works, I‚Äôm not sure if it worked before. Should be able to change the light colour
---
It messed up for me once a few days ago. I picked up the mask when I was waiting for it to start between rounds and it showed I was in the event, but when I picked up the mask - the event disappeared from my screen and I could find candy buckets but wasn‚Äôt able to pick them up. I even went into my pipboy to see if the event had deselected itself somehow but the event didn‚Äôt show up at all in the events tab. So it glitches out for me and I was only able to kill around a handful of ghouls.
---
Adding to this, allow survival characters to only gain rep with one faction, and getting more friendly with one automatically makes the other go down. Perhaps even with addition that once you get to a certain rank, instead of bonuses such as new items to buy, you get increased protection from that faction, and the ability to team up with other players in the faction.
---
New quests/events/dailies can then be faction specific, with options for the other faction to sabotage. For example, even with something like Retirement plan, doing it from Foundation's perspective where they are trying to help the former raider get to Foundation, while the raiders are trying to kill them. Only one faction can win, which would up the stakes a lot. Right now there is little that ups the stakes in the game.
---
This would work really well when the Brotherhood arrives, if they open up factions to include Crater, Foundation, BOS, Cultists, Blood Eagles, and maybe Caravan. Having more options would limit it always being an Us vs Them, and some factions may be more friendly to each other than others (like Foundation and Caravan), while some have no common ground (like Cultists).
---
well ffs.... thank you
---
There's a simple solution that would be very unpopular, but if duping continues may become a reality.
---
All weapons craftable with legendary modules, but legendaries not tradeable at all. You want a bloodied handmade, then craft handmade's until RNG gives you one, eliminating all the weapons in the pool you don't want.
---
I'd even take it being 99% reduction as opposed to the 90% from the perk, it's just that, as you said, it's got no real point practically speaking.
---
Are you sure it won't flip around when you're building it? I haven't placed a powered door but I know you can place doors on either side.

Every displayed item takes 20 units of a 10000 unit budget (numbers from the IntRaw mod). So anything displayed takes as much budget as your wall, a rug, pretty much the majority of decorations and items. The only thing smaller than these is wiring itself which consumes 5 units of space. So 4 wires between pylons will cost the same as 1 magazine which costs the same as 1 wall (half and large are both 20 units). 
---
These numbers are different in a workshop as they have a larger build limit but the mod still references a maximum of 10,000 units
---
Honestly I hope this breaks the market and it floods top tier weapons to EVERYONE. Maybe then we‚Äôll get 4-5 * weapons, buff mutants build, or the ability to craft our own weapons just the way we do with SS armor and Gauss shotguns/plasma casters...
---
You missed my point entirely. Not everyone needs a reward to do things. Some just enjoy doing those things. 
---
For me the fun part is NOT trying to get the gun. The fun is using the gun and I don't need a reason to use it except that it's fun.
---
Does Bethesda even know VATS is bugged after the patch? I haven't seen if they acknowledged it anywhere.
---
This was the exact same experience that I had. Both computers had Fallout Installed on a Secondary SSD, I was able to log in but my wife couldn‚Äôt. I had an Existing Bethesda account whereas my wife had to create a new one.
---
Don't just look at them. Try one out. The fire rate and interruptable reload is enough to make the switch.
---
Nope. I was gonna build it for my house but because the keypad was on the wrong side of the wall it would look awful
---
Well original story is mixed up with Wastelanders so no you can no longer play the pure original one.
---
You're helping us by taking these heavy ass plans off our hands.
---
Same here. I only noticed it yesterday when I saw my "Complete 3 daily NW challenges" weekly challenge completed after I had only done 1. The worst part to me is that I've just been playing and not auditing how many challenges I have or haven't done, I'm closing in on a third of the board done, so there's not an efficient way for me to back track and see what challenges didn't give me the right amount.
---
Even if I caught half of these issues, that still leaves some missed. With this Run being just barely workable if you grinded daily, I was already skeptical of giving them money to complete it. Now I know, even if they retroactively fix this, I'm not sending a dime their way just to get a skin for armor I don't use anyway that will disappear once this game eventually goes away since you can't keep this content when the servers go down.
---
Yes sir. It spawns in the grove near SBQ area
---
Definitely less. I live in the bog and used to see red and white scorch beasts flying around all over the place.
---
Quite often they would be legendary.
---
They tried to make it a mix between an MORPG and the previous fallout single player games when it should've just been a full-fledged MORPG game and then we couldve had dungeons and raids for end-game group progression content.
---
Who wants to craft ammo every 10 minutes? If i carry 1000 (2 belts worth of ammo) that‚Äôs 50 units of weight. And would last maybe, 30 minutes? Tops? It‚Äôs absurd

Could I get banned because I grabbed a duped weapon? today I was about to sell a few stimpacks to the vendor when I found lots of people in the building just waiting and a few others giving weapons and one of them gave me a fixer and a few other explosive weapons, I mean it‚Äôs cool but Idk if bethesda is gonna ban me.
---
With equal rolls a .50 Cal hunting rifle does the same damage as a lever action... The lever action has a far superior fire rate, which is what makes it more desirable than the hunting rifle... At least in regards to the meta. Personally I find the hunting rifle more satisfying to use though.
---
This sounds more like a complaint for bethsda. No high level is going to bother shopping at your camp if they knew you didn't have any legendaries. For all we know they could of been trying to be nice by giving you some caps and preventing vets from wasting their time.
---
What are these balls and what do they do? Do they drop every time? Are they just for display or also crafting?
---
No, you need to find the nocturnal rolling pin with +1 Charisma.
---
Hmm. Strange. Sounds like the opposite then in terms of who could log in. Since your wife had to create a new one and couldn't get in whereas my GF had to create one and COULD get in. Damn. Was hoping that would lead us to something
---
Cause a lot of people like to ‚Äúrole play‚Äù as a raider
---
One ton of Monies?
---
I believe you can find it in Uncanny Caverns. Appalacian Tales of the Wendigo or something like that.
---
Im not trying to break the game with an OP weapon
---
No you can't add walls or wallpaper. It's a little wonky with some items and had to use the drug trick to get some things like the ammo converter in. The lights hanging from the ceiling are also a little touch and go.
---
I was getting around 300 per mutant kill at west Tek if it was the Max level ones, I know the lunchboxes stack up to 3 times (I think?) so me and my buddies are saving those for the double score thing coming. 
---
(Ah well rested, I forgot that one when listing off the stuff I used. Turns into a 3 hour boost if you sleep in your camp with an ally but goes away if you die sadly.)
---
I know the Sentry Bots at whitesprings and the level 91 glowing deathclaws offer around 1200xp each with all these buffs, unfortunately there‚Äôs only three static sentry bots and only two level 91 glowing deathclaws that I know of at the power station north of watoga and hopewell cave.
---
I mean, if the product is still in shambles after being told they‚Äôll fix it months ago....
---
Is it a tape of a full on mission?
---
You can put a door on it!
---
You know what I want?  I want them to stop all development except for basic maintenance.  And then I want a livestream of the dev team, the board of directors or whoever makes the choices leveling a character from one to 100.  I want to watch them play the game.  I want them to suffer as we have suffered.  And then once I've seen them pull out their hair from damage not registering, or weird graphical issues, or lag, or trying in vain for months to find that one weapon to tie their character together, or grind their way through all the different types of currency, or having to stop what their doing to switch around perk cards, then I'll have confidence they'll actually improve the core game instead of just patching on new shit.  
---
No way that'll ever happen, but it's fun to dream.

Bloodied explosive lever action with a bloodied handmade for backup.

Farmer's in his den. Omar - The Wire.

There‚Äôs a charisma perk you can get that increases your sell prices and lowers buying prices, it‚Äôs an abysmally small increase even at the level 3 perk, but helps a bit. I also struggled with caps, but I find that building a boat load of water purifiers and just selling purified water makes you a decent amount. If you have Fallout 1st you can also sell bulk junk from a tinkers workbench because you‚Äôll probably end up with thousands of cloth or plastic. Hope this helps!
---
Dang that sucks. I swear that's happened with half the stuff I build. "Oh neat!" Place it. "Nope, too ugly."
---
I honestly thought, when Public Teams were announced, that you would have to do things together to form a bond for the bonus rewards. Otherwise unless you are lucky to find a team like this above, people just use them for the buffs.
---
I imagined things like to form a bond on a events team, players would have to complete the same event. For the hunting team, they would need to kill enemies within the same area. For legendaries, would have to tag and kill a legendary, and so on.
---
I'm not saying I don't like the buffs, but there's no real incentive to actually play together.
---
It's from the slocum joe pack. Totally worth getting. It has a train car and a vendor bot that sings and dances. First pack in awhile that I feel is worth the atoms.
---
My guess is that‚Äôs what really got to him. Didn‚Äôt even get a second chance on OP before the game stopped him. Love it hahah
---
Always nice when someone shares Travel Agent
---
Well, I'm glad that after all of this, you finally realize that partcipating in score challenges is a choice and if you do not feel it is worth your time then you do not have to do it.  That is ok.  Not everyone is going to be happy with every system.  
---
Me?  I'll keep doing it because it only takes a few minutes every day for free stuff.  I've worked for less than an hour every day on score and I'm at rank 35. It hasnt even been 2 full weeks.  I think everyone will be okay lol.
---
It‚Äôs like most other games, find what people want and go get it, go find junk, break it down and turns it into bulk mats, you can sell them super easy if you aren‚Äôt greedy and the money will keep rolling in, also sell any extra ammo you have, they‚Äôll all definitely sell for a cap each, the money‚Äôs out there, you just gotta be willing to put in the grind
---
That's good info. I found a bloodied 3 star lever. I'll hold onto it and see.
---
Good to know, I've been looking for the Witch costume. I did recently run across the skeleton plan.
---
It‚Äôs super annoying because it‚Äôs either have your building look ugly or just use a regular door (which I‚Äôve had to do)
---
I played solo 98% of the time up until Public Teams. Now I run Bodyguards 3 and a shared Inspirational 1 and ALWAYS stay on a team; Building if I'm not doing Events (for the Int boost for extra XP), Events for Events. Hell even if no one joins your team you still get the bonus boost.
---
Being an Atom Shop item they probably didn't make it too powerful because of probable backlash, *pay to win* etc.
---
If you go to Camden park do the Dross toss. And while you are standing in front of the game stand look up most of the bears are up there hanging as prizes. Then if you head south under the bridge is a shack. The panda I think is there or the bee. And another place I know has most of the bears is if you got to scenic overlook. Head towards the monorail line just NW. Find the nuclear silo hatch where the rockets come out of. (Not the site charlie) follow that monorail N a little and there is a small encampment with most of the bears in a campfire. With two gnomes. I used to live up there in the mountains. It is remote but it's always there. Also the beer hat is there in the jeep too.
---
Thanks for the clarification.

I just restarted the game and my hud was there

---
Assuming you have decent armor, i.e. Scout armor with polymer mods or heavy combat armor with BOS mods - let alone Secret Service armor - Vanguard's really kinda sucks, due to diminishing returns when going above \~300 DR/ER. You get a lot more defensive value out of a mix of mob-type-specific 15% damage reduction pieces (one each of Zealot's, Troubleshooter's, Mutant Slayer's and Ghoul Slayer's) than a full set of Vanguard's armor.
---
See if you can get two pieces with 25 poison resistance as the 2nd effect to help against mirelurks.
---
If you want to be really tanky, look for armor that has one of the 15% reductions when blocking/standing/sprinting as the 3rd star. Which one(s) to choose depends mainly on what you do when you get under fire: block, stand and fight, or run to reset the battle field.
---
They dropped every time for me. They're basically just trophies. They can be scrapped for a small amount of components.
---
I do not know if they auto scrap or not. I made sure to deposit them right after I got them.
---
‚Ä¶and we *all* know that r/giraffesdontexist
---
Right. So you see how someone like the person you originally replied to who started recently and isn't familiar with the I nee workings of a pretend economy in a game with no interplayer chat may have some trouble knowing those things?
---
Those aren't straight game mechanics that get introduced. If you play the game like a Fallout game that has some group activities you won't make crazy money.
---
The caps obviously create a sense of pride and accomplishment. /s.
---
Thank you for this post!
---
The game is called a MMO so at this point the game should be built around playing at your pace. The limits are bloody stupid and it‚Äôs honestly what kills it for me. Outside of all the glitches and duping I still love the game but the limits? Come on now. I understand dailies, I‚Äôve played mmos for a long time now but putting needless grind within grind and a limit of what I can get when I can keep doing said thing?
---
No, I will not. I actually enjoy the game because the map is, hands down, the best they ever made. This game could be so much more if they'd actually improve things instead of introducing more and more grind.
---
two accounts on two separate Playstations
---
Kicker for me is when servers eventually go down for this game, cosmetics, CAMP masterpieces and optimised builds go out the window. It disappears into Oblivion...
---
Since there's no save files, can't even port it over to FO4... I wish the next expansion is to make this locally hosted like a ME3 or ARMA match, so if servers did go down, you still have what you have.
---
Quite the opposite for me. I nail headshots with 20-30% consistently. I thought the rng is great in this fallout!
---
My non-NW team has been playing NW for the score, and we‚Äôve actually started enjoying it. We went in for the July 9th kill 9 creatures, and I think I got 1 and another got 2, but that was it. We felt like it would take all day, even if you were good at NW! It was not worth the score. If it had been a weekly challenge, then sure, but 9 in a day? That was bunk. Instead, we went back to Adventure mode and just rolled our XP over. It was basically the same amount of score but it was a lot more fun.
---
Imperial, Metric or Butt?

I hear you. Good luck with your build!

GT?

I'll make you some nice things

Thanks man

This is the attitude I don‚Äôt get, like I know the profit is their priority so why wouldn‚Äôt they capitalise on it? They could bring out new maps like in eso and so many people would buy it.

Any tips on someone who can only get on an hour or two to do dailies? How is everyone so far ahead? Farming events with loads of XP boosts?

If ur running full health people will say vanguard but it‚Äôs been proven that using troubleshooter, ghouls, zealots, etc wind up giving u more protection over vanguard.   
---
Just pick the enemy type u struggle with the most.  
---
That‚Äôs 15% damage reduction all the time.  Not just on high health like vanguard.
---
Damn, that's so annoying. Thank you though. Have it on my nvme drive currently, will need to free up some space on my sad.
---
I get that, but at the same time, they sold a utility item that does something worse than I can already do for free. I'm in the boat that I want things I buy to actual improve my gameplay in someway amd not always be just cosmetic, so selling something that affects gameplay but does it poorly kinda feels like a missed opportunity.
---
Please do!
---
So, I've never been online anywhere near the time the challenges reset so I've never had this issue but I did wonder, I know support is telling people they can't grant score because of tool limitations... but they can grant atoms.  Did you try asking for atoms to make up for the score points instead?  Or did anyone?  Curious as to what their response would be to this.
---
This. Why do they have to make everything so convoluted and grindy? This is much simpler without feeling too easy. Take my upvote!
---
This dupe removed the point of playing that game
---
It means ok, you can stop tagging me in these posts. 
---
Whether or not the team gets message, cares, or is able to implement any changes is irrelevant. Community Managers have done their job at that point.
---
Time and time again this gets posted, people complaining about the grind, the daily limits, the RNG... yet you're still playing the game. So Bethesda is actually doing something "right" then... if you want to make an actual point, stop playing the game. Honestly, I've switched back over to ESO and couldn't be more happier. 
---
And before someone says "why are you posting here then" it's because I'm keeping updated on the game.. to see if they fix some of these issues. If they actually do change some of this I may start playing again.
---
That's software development for ya
---
Im ok with the duping. I have 3 characters, 2 near level 300 and the other is around 100. The RNG for me has been absolutely terrible. The only way Ive gotten anything good is by trading or buying from other players. So, dupe away my friends. Flood the market so the less fortunate RNG folks like myself can have good things.
---
How is this in any way related to the issues this game has? A game can be shit but you still enjoy it. This game isn't shit, it's just underdevelop and riddled with dumb design decisions.
---
I dont need no encouragement
---
Perks and Legendary depending, the amount of Damage difference is very negligible between a Hunting Rifle and a Lever Action. You won't see much of a different just looking at them, but you'll FEEL the difference when you use them. Pairing something like Gun Fu and Adrenaline gets far more mileage on a LE than a Hunting Rifle.
---
I thought the Legendary Perk Cards went live in 20, but I've never seen them. Is it still in the PTS?
---
Also, the 'changes' the Ammo Converter they talked about yesterday don't seem to actually be in effect; still takes the same number of clicks and menuing to do anything.
---
"16x the detail." I see that much detail when I playthrough my nightmares hearing the menu music startup and my only dialog option with the UI is "Ok" after my last disconnect happened prior to grabbing the mythical two-shot, bloodied explosive combat shotgun off a legendary dung-beetle I just killed.

I also hate that the camp budget double dips with your stash.

Msged in the chat invite thingy (:
---
Make your own building group, and switch the group to "events" when you are about to finish one. And then switch right back. There is no cd on the meter thingy. You can change between different group types from the social menu where you see all member names, by right clicking your own. Nobody notices or cares if the group is changed to "events" for couple of seconds.
---
Clipboards give springs not screws I thought.
---
I never said that. There are some people who use exploits to level up fast. If you somehow level up to 1500 legit, then maybe you should be rewarded

Scrap box alone makes it worth it.  If I didn‚Äôt have the unlimited scrap space I don‚Äôt think I would have played this game this long. 
---
Not worrying about stash space is the biggest QOL in this game.
---
I attempted this one today and managed to get killed by a fellow bush wookie when I stepped out of my own to shoot a creature. The next 2 matches I never saw any. Thats when i gave up. Id honestly rather grind the repeatable
---
I think they mean the BOS event where you drop mats at Atlas Observatory for it to be built up over time. Coming soon I think.
---
I think you totally missed the point. If it wasn‚Äôt so tedious and wasn‚Äôt such massive commitment that sets you back a ton for missing even ONE day, less people would feel like this and more people would be motivated to give it a try. I know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way, I‚Äôve seen plenty of posts on here about it but I tried to offer some sort of solution at least, it wasn‚Äôt just complaining for the sake of complaining.  And the fact that the legendary perk system appears to be an even more ridiculous grind than this, a pattern is forming that is going to push even more people away.
---
Berry mentats also affect prices I‚Äôve observed.
---
If creatures were to be a thing in this mode, they should have dialed it up to 11 IMO. Either the mode is purely about fighting other candidates, or it's about fighting the other candidates while also trying to fend off the horrors and dangers of appalachia. As they are, they're so rare and hardly hold anything worthwhile that being told to hunt them feels way to tedious and dependent on rng.

When I use a sniper build I use a VE hunting rifle with a bloodied Combat Knife +strength and Chinese armor. It‚Äôs way OP

I just got to endgame too. Spent all of my legendary scrips with the sale to get absolutely nothing worthwhile, and I can‚Äôt sell it back because I‚Äôve used up my daily limit. Wanted 6000 caps so I could get the bullion from wayward but used up the 1400 vendor limit at around 5800 caps. Dailies for the factions apparently haven‚Äôt reset even though I did them yesterday and there‚Äôs no timer anywhere. Really wanna keep playing, but after about an hour I just couldn‚Äôt work towards anything I want because of these damn limits.
---
I just don‚Äôt know why these decisions are made. ESO fixes half these problems. You spend gold to respec whenever, there‚Äôs no lag when opening a map, and interiors have maps. Dailies can be reaccepted if you cancel them; I lost my raider daily today because the damn target spawned in a workshop and got killed by bugs again, cancelled it and now I seemingly have to wait until tomorrow? It punishes the player for no reason. Sigh, I‚Äôm still about to log in again though, and yes I hate myself for it.
---
Less than 1 percent of all players dont even hit 100. Divide by 10 for each extra hundred.
---
You want them to sell things that give you an advantage?
---
All allied have a chance to drop all loot. 
---
You would still need to learn the plans for certain weapons/gear
---
If u don‚Äôt have fixer plan learned it will never drop.
---
Perhaps they are so used to playing with the dev console on to give them everything they need when they need it without the grind so they go yeah this is fun to play with ignoring the fact it would take them months or longer to get what they are using.

---
I guess what I really want is some sort of actual communication.
---
Like, we bring up all these issues, they get the feedback and pass it on. 
---
Now what? Has there ever been any feedback being followed up on? With the exception of Fasnacht being comically broken, being pulled and actually fixed reasonably fast? Or the Ammo Converter causing enough of a stink to have Jeff Gardiner step in? Not really.
---
I'm sorry but if I somehow expect communication to work in both directions. We give feedback, they receive the feedback, what's the response? You can't expect a follow up on virtually everything but some issues deserve a bit more than silence and maybe a short mention in the ITV.
---
No, you're right.  That kind of behavior is reserved for rich people in the real world.
---
You probably read a lot of posts on here with people doing bad math.  This isnt true it's not a massive commitment.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUnOYA-jFrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUnOYA-jFrI)

It has taken me only a few mintues every day and I am level 35 and I still have over 2 months left to work on my pass.  You cannot even say it is a massive commitment the evidence is here.

the cap limit on cap and subsequently everything else was due to early exploits when the game first came out that allowed players to gain hundreds of thousands of caps in minutes. which can "ruin the economy". so a few months after release, they implemented a hard cap on caps and carrying weight to combat these people who had hundreds of thousands if not millions of caps and weight. they don't want it to happen again, so they put limits on everything so 
---
1. it makes you come back again to get more
---
2. if there is an exploit, it won't damage the already destroyed economy
---
3. the grind gives you the good old fashion EA "sense of pride and accomplishment". and pads out the "content" and play time.
---
I think it‚Äôs the opposite. When people have the ability to get a weapon they actually want, then they stick around. Nobody wants to login everyday just to kill a bunch of legendary enemies in hopes of getting even a semi useful weapon. If I had one or two perfect weapons for my character right now then I‚Äôd be playing a lot more. But I find myself playing less because I‚Äôve got two characters.. level 160 and 110. And I‚Äôve only ever rolled 3 legendary handmades since I‚Äôve played the game. And only one was useful. There isn‚Äôt enough content to justify grinding your ass off for a gun you want. But on the other hand, having a perfect weapon and slaughtering everything will at least keep you entertained for awhile.
---
The daily limits are intended to maximize daily engagement.  Daily simultaneous players is a pretty standard live service game metric.
---
They are working as intended and aren't likely to change.  The ammo converter changes don't interfere with that.
---
It's not a matter of "oh, the devs are evil or inept".  They are responding rationally to their incentives.  Once you have a general idea what metrics the powers that be are using to judge the devs performance you kind of know where to push and where to save your breath.
---
The way I see it, NW should be considered its own entity, with its own rewards just for NW, so players who enjoy that game mode can play it and benefit from it, and those who don't, won't feel like they are being left out. Perhaps it will mean less players playing overall, but it might make it more enjoyable for those who do, when matches aren't filled with 20 players hiding to just get that placement XP for the CAMP item they want.
---
It is almost like if they had challenges for SCORE that could only be earned by playing Fallout Shelter. You might have some players who will like this, but then many who will begrudgingly get the game just because of FOMO. The only thing this accomplishes is gives Bethesda stats that show more people are "playing" their games...
---
^this
---
Butt of course!! Who‚Äôs butt though?
---
I'm going to be honest, any answer I give you here is just going to set you off.
---
I'm tired of everything being purely cosmetic and not practically adding to my gameplay experience, I'll leave it at that.

"Just wanted to confirm... Before I start doing my own duping".

Kind of hope you and your buddy's does as it ruins the game for others...

They don't people for duping usually.  They really only go after the big RMT people it seems.  I don't think they have the manpower to go through and ban everyone who duped which sucks.
---
I did actually! On my first ticket they said and I quote "Read Answer Provided". Twice. So I gave up on that and made a brand new ticket, on that one I'm waiting on a response on my question if there is any reimbursement for me and others losing out on score.
---
It's still a terrible system. Give us a slot and Perk point every 50 levels, let us pick and swap ANY level 1 Perk we want and use it. By level 100 you get two Slots and two Perk points, you can use a level 2 or two level 1. There should be NO cost to swapping, there shouldn't even be a cost to getting the cards; these should all be Reward-Based for reaching those levels.
---
Perk Coins should be used to simply fast-track the process. Want another slot? Okay, 100 coins. Want another Perk Point? Okay, 100 coins.
---
I saw two posts from yesterday. One had a screenshot of an email but those can be fabricated so it‚Äôs hard to say if it‚Äôs legit. The other one showed a screenshot of a login in error message that you will commonly get if you‚Äôre banned but you can also receive the same error code for server issues as well. 
---
A guy on my friends list that I‚Äôve traded with in the past was duping ALL day yesterday. He was giving away B2525 Fixers and handmades to players all night. As of the time I went to bed he was not banned. This same guy has been giving away thousands and thousands of Xmas gifts since the last dupe. He said two players on his friends list received bans yesterday but they did not do any duping. They had used the exploit to reach max rank on the season board so his assumption was that‚Äôs what got them banned.
---
No, that‚Äôs a shitty ass product.

I have a junkies FFR one and I love it. I can kill a sheepsquatch from sneak before his health regenerates. But yes vats is a must. I'm getting 318 base damage from mine with the automatic receiver on it.

Then fucking start off your sentence/Post like that. Aint no dev manager, community leader gonna talk to someone being fucking rude as fuck.

That 's part of the experience. If you can't have a proper criticism then you fall short on deaf ears.

good luck with that. great way to drive away a massive chunk of your playerbase, really.
---
this sounds like.... c o m m u n i s m
---
It's better than what they have now. But level 1200 still seems like a ton to max all your cards. At level 340 Ive stopped level quickly at all lol. I feel like being level 500, or hell even 600 would be a better spot to have 6 maxed cards
---
Say you can max a card every 100 levels, most players won't make it to level 600. But less than 1% of players will make it to 1200, and most of those used an exploit
---
That's what I do when i'm the leader.
---
soo level 1200 to have all 6 at max rank....great /s
---
ive been playing since beta, a non bloodied build and im only at 376,  so that would take me almost 4 years to level up all 6 perks at my current rate,  way longer still if i ever decide to change perks
---
Fallout 76 is very clearly following the success and model of games like Destiny and Fortnite.  The model being ‚Äúkeep them coming every day and chasing something every day‚Äù.  The result of this is more exposure to the atom shop (you see the pop up every time you log in) and more chance to get you to spend money.  
---
Increasing the pools of scrip, caps, gold, only gives players more opportunity to get what we want in a play session, and may give players the sense of ‚Äúthey beat the game‚Äù and not returning for a while.
---
Those things aren't mutually exclusive, I wish more devs and publishers realized this.
---
I would love if they brought back survival mode (or hell even a separate adventure mode) but made everyone go in on a clean slate character.  I would literally only play there
---
Until they make there way to WSS because they are fresh throwaway accounts to dupe withüòÇ
---
We got NW 3 creature kill challenge first, then we got NW 9 creature kill challenge later. I wonder is there NW 27 creature kill challenge in the future.
---
I was under the impression grenadier only effects thrown explosives and not guns?
---
Damn!  So they really playing hardball.. that sucks.  I think people will eventually get compensated who reported it.  I bet itll take a bit though.
---
Here's the ugly truth: data tells a better story than small echo chambers like these forums.
---
Any game company will tell you that "their most rabid fans" actually account for the barest fraction of *actual players*. The majority that play will never visit reddit, or their forums, or other online sites. So the information you can pull from "the community" may be anecdotally interesting, but in reality any game dev that based major game decisions on feedback from a forum like this would be idiots.
---
Want a perfect example? Go look at how much incessant bitching there is about MTX here on reddit. Sometimes, this forum is nothing but people yelling and screaming about P2W, or complaining about how Bethesda are "doing it wrong", or whatever. 
---
Then, log into the game, and start visiting CAMPs. I would say at least 80% of the CAMPs I visit have significant amounts of Atom Shop items in them. True - they may be bought with "earned" Atoms - but the fact remains that people are shopping there far, far more frequently than this website would have you think.
---
NW? Same thing. Here - it's a rotting cesspit of hacking and filth. In the actual game? I rarely ever see hackers, and since the new Season dropped I've seen a huge uptick in players in the mode. Even if they're only there for the dailies it still means more games, faster.
---
And this new Season thing? Fuck, I hate the whole goddamned idea. But man, that FOMO has me logging in everyday doing the stupid dailies, *right* as I was about to convince myself I was going to take a break from playing. Hell - I might even resub to FO1 for another month, because I wouldn't mind having a private server against for doing stuff.
---
Bethesda needs to get much, **much** better at testing, and getting *tester* feedback, for sure. But listening to the community? THIS community? If they did that, they'd take a magnet to their servers and set fire to their offices.
---
Have a great weekend.
---
I feel you. I've been thinking of maybe seeing how far I can get into the Legendary Run and maybe buying a few of the last ranks, but now that this has happened I'm not sure about that. I do feel like they owe us at least some compensation for this loss, and if they don't, well, let's say that it's rather convenient for them to allow us to buy ranks for atoms...
---
I love the idea...very New Vegas :) but I have to wonder if it'd be too much to implement right now
---
If you refuse to pay money, why do they give two fucks about what you think?
---
The institute dupes your character, a synth runs in, takes everything from you, makes you make a new character, while the "duped" former character constantly makes npcs hate your new character by spreading rumors and blaming your new character for everything bad that happens
---
Oh, a fellow Wastelander :D Hope W3 will be as good as W2 it was a nice catch-up on isometric fallout.
---
Feedback on our feedback, I guess.
---
\- Yo, &lt;feedback&gt;
---
\- Feedback gets passed along.
---
\- Reply to us that it's worked on, ignored for design reasons, not possible due to whatever other reason. Etc. pp. 
---
It probably comes down to me wanting a bit more information/comminication. We pass all of this along, a CM passes it along to the team. Silence. It's obvious that this is not possible for most things but some issues, imo, deserve a follow up.
---
the devs are also not playing the same game us. As they still use Ammo and med vendors as well as thinking that the legendary perk system &amp; perk points are reasonable and that the ammo converter UI was acceptable.
---
This. Let me have whatever the hell I want as long as I'm not abusing it and annoying other people with it. I play almost exclusively on a private server, so what does it matter if I have every God roll weapon in the whole game?  If they wiped my account I'd never play again. Pretty sure many others would do the same.
---
Yea it'll be some dude finally decides one of the "I'll pass it on" messages is important enough. So he walks over the to relevant teams door and drops the idea while shooting the shit with them. 
---
Asking about the weather probably yields a greater response
---
I hear ya, and I mean that is technically the case for every game, but 76 is an unfortunate place of having next gen consoles coming soon, and while I‚Äôm sure people will still play this well after those come out, once the next gen consoles hit their stride and start getting legit next gen games (not just previous gen games slightly upgraded etc) plus Cyberpunk which will have much of the same playerbase, even more people will move on. My overall point is long but unengaging grinds are not a good way to extend the lifespan of the game and maintain the interest of the current playerbase. More people are going to stop playing regularly long before the servers go down, if they keep going with these extreme grinds.
---
I run with the facebook groups primarily and I know of at least 10 different people on there who are now banned or have had a burner account banned (they are also trusted so I wont doubt there info)
---
Seems a bit harsh wiping players inventories, that could break the internet. Just add ‚ÄúDupe Kits‚Äù to the atom shop - everyone wins.
---
what the fuck is 9. it should be like 2.
---
We have nuked every part of the map, there's nothing more to nuke.
---
Happened to me on schorched earth but something weird about it my controller light went yellow like if it was charging but if I got out of the game it would be blue and get in would be yellow and I thought it was my controller but now I see it may be the game.
---
This is just asinine.
---
Not at all - My camp is between the two peaks on [Seneca Rocks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Seneca_Rocks) and I would LOVE a larger area and more budget. Most of it was taken up laying out Myst-like walkways and foundations to get it built.
---
Agree 100000% 
---
This game needs a full rebalance
---
A solution that maybe someone has put out, but that I haven't seen yet - if timegated caps are a thing to stay, allow players to choose one "currency" that is uncapped, so that they can focus on their grind. Going for the Secret Service armor? Keep the cap on Caps and Scrip, but allow us to actually grind bullion. Farming legendaries? Allow unlimited scrip, but limit everything else. I'd still think there would have to be a vendor price limit for caps. And maybe a bonus like +XP for anyone who doesn't choose to "uncap" one of their currencies. You'd be able to change your "uncap", but only if you go back to below the cap (either automatically when you change, or by getting rid of what you have. It would allow players to focus their grind to get what they want, and not feel like they are being blocked at every turn.
---
(uses 3* Rolling pin to destroy own camp, Apalachia implodes, we all join Wooby in the Dev Room)
---
What do you mean there's no cap? Junkies is capped at 50% and bloodied is at 80% (I think, it might go to 95% at 5% hp though)
---
Thats odd, I spawned in the north side of the map, grafton?? Or graham? I dont know places names well, and found 3 or 4 dogs spawned there fairly regularly.
---
NW is concentrated, focused PvP for the sake of PvP exclusively. That's the one point of the mode. What I propose would be more rounded for adventuring as well.
---
Here is the problem with your theory:  There is always going to be a META.  If you nerf bloodied and junkies, people will start duping AA stuff.  Whatever is the best it will be duped.  This won't stop anything except what types of weapons people are duping.
---
Assuming others don‚Äôt spawn in and get weapons before you.
---
dont.....dont give them that idea please.....
---
A few minutes every day HAS to be an exaggeration. I did every daily and weekly plus some repeatable up until a few days ago and was not on track to finish (assuming an equal amount of time required per week). And it took me about 2 hours a day roughly to do all the challenges plus the rep missions would be an extra hour or so mostly loading screens.
---
it's the 3 little pigs theory, the brick house is just too much for the wolf to handle.
---
If you like to collect this completely ruins the point of collecting.  What is the point of collecting something that everyone else has?  Nothing is special or unique anymore.
---
Looks like with FO76 going free on game pass, were going to see a lot of these posts.
---
Exactly, it just ruined the game for me, now my collection is pretty much worthless lol
---
It‚Äôs a game not real life
---
Level 231 , since launch I spent 6 months not playing,  the rest of the time I have , all those hours pumped in , and I've only ever had an AA FFR fixer , and I'm a bloodied build,  I gave up and started trying to find a 1* bloodied fixer ..... until one of these "ophras" gave out a B FFR RW  
---
I'm happy now to go about my business, most likely even go back to my magic 50.cal
---
I feel like everyone saying a wipe is impractical either spent a ton of time on the game or is one of the dupers
---
Yes the difference between the house and Bethesda is that once somebody broke in the owner is probably doing the right ammount of security to make that impossible to do a second time at bethesda this isnt the case lol
---
i weigh about 1000~
---
this is how i move across the world
---
i have 18~ agility and still walk faster then people sprint lOL
---
Because the way to beat the game is getting a god roll fixer? I think you‚Äôre projecting your jealousy on the whole player base. I couldn‚Äôt give a shit if I have a fixer or if -IFukdYoMama69- has a fixer. There‚Äôs more to the game than having a good gun. And your solution of wiping every account is just asinine. You know how many players with hundreds or thousand of hours would completely stop playing if that happened? We get it, you‚Äôre jealous others are getting good weapons (which will help you complete the tougher events faster, but we don‚Äôt talk about the positives), but not everyone cares. 99% of players won‚Äôt see any repercussions of this dupe other than butthurt players complaining they don‚Äôt have the thing others are getting. I know, unpopular opinion here so I don‚Äôt mind the downvoted, it needs to be said.
---
Oh hell yes, I see tons of cool items in camps and on players that are atom shop only. Or make like a greatest hits list or something, I want them allü§™
---
Maybe this new volley surge of players will invoke a future purge event....
---
... prolly not, just dead brahmin everywhere...
---
damn synths
---
duping would have with or without bloodied and junkie's. people would just dupe whatever is meta instead.
---
griefing doesn't involve bloodied or junkie's weapons, either. it's a bug caused by the syringer and environmental rad damage.
---
pvp is separate, extremely complex matter. and one that most people don't care about.
---
Oh I do hope so lol. Though I feel like maybe it won't be worth the hassle of making 25 support tickets üòÇ
---
I'll keep trying them though, until they end up blocking my account if they have to haha
---
Yeah I would love this. Or just make events spawn more often.
---
Okay so something similar has happened before, good to know. Thought I broke something.
---
Good read and yes I agree, we are set to fate a role in both factions with no consequences. And hopefully in the future we have more detailed and in depth story and alternatives to our actions. 
---
I want raiders to fight back and negative rep from either faction where they will send NPC death squads to get you and perhaps player bounties as well.
---
(bobby voice): "balls..."
---
Rep missions take you an hour?  I've done the rep missions for extra notes on all 5 of my characters every single day and it takes me roughly an hour to do them on all 5 characters...  About 10-15 minutes per character depending on load screen times.  I think you might just be doing things inefficiently.   Anyways, I know you probably didnt but i really hope you watch that video because itll put things in perspective for you.
---
For you maybe
---
Yes, but it feels like you're being double-dipped.
---
99% of there playerbase , Minimum  
---
After everything ?? 
---
Running nukes , the raids , the scout quests 
---
I'd rather dip my testicles in battery acid then be forced to re do all that
---
Brilliant idea , or like secret service armour
---
Bloodied is Risk vs Reward. I've been taken out by mole rats sneaking up on me. Junkies you have to keep yourself chemmed up to offset the addictions or you face a massive amount of negative effects.
---
There are downsides to these builds. All duping does it make it easier to get the gear to allow you to survive more.
---
Personally I had a random build up until level 200, then I thought "I'm this high a level, with the perfect Perk loadout, playing a Sniper. I should be able to one-shot almost everything." So I put the effort into respeccing, and picking new Perks, grinding and tracking down gear, and then learning HOW to survive as a Bloodied character.

I tried PvP once, and you know what happened? Someone with a FFR Gamma Gun Rad'd me to death in seconds.
---
I feel like Fort Defiance is the best example of "environmental storytelling" in FO76. The place is reputedly a haunted mental asylum, and sure enough, you're hearing "phantom sounds" throughout the whole building. 
---
It even makes me appreciate the annoying bug where ghouls will chase you up to level 4, past the laser grid door. It lets you know that nowhere is safe in the crazy house!
---
Awsome , long live the revolution üëç

What is there left to do
---
who is going to pay the licensing fees for new music?
---
music isnt free...
---
Very often I find that people's moral compass in games directly translates over to what they think is ok and not ok in real life.  For example, people who are mean and toxic in online games are probably mean and toxic IRL too.
---
People who cheat in games probably cheat in real life too whether it be skipping corners at work or slacking.  People who try to game the system do it everywhere.
---
That‚Äôs the spirit üëç
---
I think it would only work if, like some others suggested, if it was a new mode for a new character - so you can't go back and forth like the previous Survival mode. That way you also wouldn't have to respec a character if you wanted a different build style, and would at least start everyone off on the same footing. The mode wouldn't be for everyone, and may not even need the full main quest like Adventure has, but it would keep some long-time players in the game with something that is entirely new.
---
To be fair (To be faaaaaaaaaaaaair), Bloodied Unarmed with the right Perks, Foods, and Chems can do an INSANE amount of damage compared to the weapons 'base' amount. But it takes planning and effort.

Hey if your pockets are so full.....

Not jealous. Any time I want I can simply get a god roll anything from a duper on the Xbox lfg page. The point is that no one simply gets the best gun in the game and stays interested. You might play for a month after that but once there isn‚Äôt anything new to get then why play
---
They have a huge library of already licensed music
---
You want me banned? I didn‚Äôt try to dupe because of the people that said they were and I think it‚Äôs actually good because now casual players have access to these weapons like if this never came out I would of never had the chance to even use one
---
Fine. That's still way to much for just ONE weapon to give, along with any other combat damage bonus you can get, which in this game, is a lot. That's why you literally see players walking around with 80-95% of their hitpoints taken by rad damage. 
---
That might as well be unlimited, when you see people saying they can easily do thousands of points of damage easily. 
---
Doesn't matter if there's a cap if it's literally allowing players to remove any challange because everything is one shot killed.
---
I love seeing Dwellers emerging from the Vault. Lately though, I'm wondering if it's alternate characters for the easy level up for SCORE?
---
If you don't mind me asking what do you do with the rest of the time you're playing to be at rank 35?
---
I've done all the dailies and weeklies so far and am only at 26 or so, and I play for roughly 3-4 hours a day. (Granted I'm just generally pottering round here and there doing the odd event and just looking about). 
---
I'm enjoying the Legendary Run so far, it's a better way of doing the dailies than just awarding atoms that sit in my account until something I fancy comes into the atom shop (not very often). 
---
The thing I have a problem with is that people that log on, do the dailies and weeklies and log off again, (say 1hr per day?) Have a much much easier and more enjoyable time than someone who can only play at the weekend for 5hrs/day (so more time in total). 
---
Personally I think Bethesda have some statistic that states more log ons = more atom purchases, as apposed to more time played = more atom purchases.
---
Not sure how to reply as not sure what asinine means , will google and get back to you
---
Did you file a ticket?
---
Yea no I‚Äôm not going to try I‚Äôm not really that desperate I was just curious
---
A fool and his money are quickly parted.
---
Y√´z I did it now
---
I stopped playing when they added the back pack and those tedious challenges. I see the game has only become worst.
---
You just might want to do some more research.
---
* bloodied is not the instigator nor the reason there is duping
---
* bloodied is not the reason PvP is inbalanced
---
* bloodied is not the reason for grieving
---
* there is a very clear cap on the benefits
---
* neither junkies nor bloodied weapons "dominate" the game
---
Seeing as you are still a vault dweller, maybe close the doors behind you and don't bother others with your unfounded theories. Come back out when you have at least a partial clue.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the beginning and after 1000+ hours I‚Äôm still only at 342.  Granted, I‚Äôve taken some days and weeks off but the highest I‚Äôve seen is a player that was 950.   1500?  Yeah right.
---
Fully agree, but I'd like a dialogue/notification history log somewhere in settings or pip boy etc for all text, not just vendor purchases. I often miss things but in something like GTAV you can just go to the info/dialogue section and see everything on screen from that session which is great. Would also be very useful for quest rewards that have ellipsis and don't show the full list of what you earned without having to search through the pip boy to see what's randomly appeared in your inventory
---
Sounds closer to my experience, lol
---
If you only played to grind for a single weapon dont you find that tedious and boring 
---
After every legendary I'd be like " oh look , a nocturnal lead pipe ....... again"
---
Just wait until they release the ‚Äúfeature‚Äù that allows you to level up using atoms, similar to how seasons works...
---
gauss also has a suppressor (gauss pistol and rifle). 
---
The explosive dmg perk also helps improve gauss weapon dmg. 
---
also, the .50 cal ammo crafts a lot faster than the .308... (something like 100 rounds for .50 unperk-buffed, 180 w/ full ammo perk)... 
---
for hunting rifle, the .50 just felt easier to keep ammo stocked
---
I‚Äôve noticed a few times when someone makes a highly upvoted post about something they want to return in the store, it tends to appear within a couple weeks. Not guaranteed, but it certainly seems to increase the chances.
---
Yup lol.  I feel bad for folks who have spent months collecting all the different legacy gatling plasmas legitimately through trading.  What a real kick in the nuts.
---
Bethesda? You mean the company that releases patches that continue to not fix bugs? Or the one that eliminated ATOMS? Maybe the one that won‚Äôt balance any other build to compete with Bloodied? I feel bad for those who‚Äôve paid so high to acquire awesome stuff, but there‚Äôs plenty of us in the thousands of hours range, playing since beta still grinding with crappy gear due to low drop rates and zero value monetary system. I hope this brings some change...
---
Welcome to the party friend.
---
I have lived this cycle like 4 times now and refuse to play any longer. I dont even visit this sub anymore I just see threads every once and a while on the main feed. 
---
Is FO5 out yet? ::waits 5 more years::
---
Just googled it - guess that fact I had to do that means you were right all along üëç
---
Me too, I got back into ESO because 76 totally burned me out, I don't want to feel like I have to log in every day to do the same, and even then it's so limited because once you reach your limit there's nothing left to do for the day.
---
Got out before the SCORE system started so I can't talk about that, but ESO feels 10 times better in terms of quality and content.
---
each use requires its own license.. they dont pay once and get to use a song in any game they want to forever... that isnt how it works..
---
Blame what? Using the internet to express opinions? Well you sure got me there...
---
This is probably true 90% of the time, and I only say that because humans are weird and don‚Äôt always follow the same rules as the next person.
---
What else is there to play for
---
if todd howard would cook drugs instead of lying to his community,   
---
they would make your brain crash
---
And as this forum and elsewhere will show, it's been pretty well laid out on how to do that. Which is why bloodied weapons seem to be the most popular weapon to dupe. 
---
So the planning and effort has been removed because there's so many how to guides.
---
‚ÄúGrafton Mayor here!!!‚Äù
---
I'm trying to look for results on this and if the entire map has been nuked and I'm not seeing anything. I'm sure we've dropped them in a lot of spots but just looking for proof of what happens at each location.
---
(vault doors open)
---
(Todd Voice): "Birth...."
---
(flood of players)
---
The limits, for the daily scrips at least, are so you log in day after day. Dont want to make it possible to grind, like... all of the scrips you could every use in only a handful of days. Not saying you have to agree with that or whatever, but I almost guarantee thats the point of it. MMOs by-and-large have various daily/weekly limits like this.
---
A lot of the *overall* limits seem bizarre though. Id wager it could be to prevent technical issues? Remember - these developers *want* you to play the game and they *want* it to be fun. They are, of course, on your side. Whether it seems like it or not. A lot of these decisions they make are not born from folks who are going "Hahaha! Look at how much of their time we're wasting!" or something like that. So when you see something in 76 that is strange/bad, before you quickly think "Wow, these people are incompetent" or "I cant believe this, do they even play their own game?!", think about the design process, and what goes into making a decision like this. Because a lot of the time, if we think of a "fix" to something that they have put into the game, they already thought of it and implementing said "fix" causes more issues than its worth. So, they approach it differently.
---
Why is there not a cap on plans or other items. You can find images of dupers with millions of bobble heads and mats( Google dupers inventory picture fo76).
---
you're right that I haven't spent meaningful time in PvP. I suck at it and thus don't like it...but it's not my point to make a PVP mode...I'm trying to formulate something a little different, a middle ground where maybe the Disney-Ride Fallout players and the PvPers can share a world.
---
2 shot accuracy is ass...
---
He's literally a time ticker for the season. He moves one space per day. When he reaches the end, the season is over. So you do need to beat him to the last space by the last day.
---
Why should I? Me enjoying the game has absolutely nothing to do with the issues it has and, quite frankly, I'd rather get to the point than to beat around the bush. 
---
"You know, I do enjoy the game, I really do. I love it. I love Todd and have an altar to him in my room.
---
But:"
---
Everything before a BUT is completely irrelevant and can instantly be ignored. Even if it's meant to butter someone up it will not be remembered at all because everything after it renders the kiss ass introduction null and void.
---
I didn't have an account when this bug happened. I created one and then it kept giving me this error and i couldn't play untill i moved it to the other drive. So i think this problem is kinda random.
---
Not something I use.  I had stranger in numbers earlier today.  I got email to change, so I used the one that reduced thirst with chems.  If one person shares stranger than numbers, then everyone else can use another card, right?
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt like two shot. I prefer quad, instigating, or anti armor
---
...and those players are also one molerat or rad roach away from death.
---
Easy solution to the no legendaries and healing is dramatically increase the weight of healing items, and remove perks that reduce the weight. Or decrease carry weight to a realistic level (please explain to me how an average person can carry 150 pounds (assuming weight is in pounds) of stuff and still be able to sprint, jump, etc. I can't sustain doing that even when I'm not carrying things)
---
I wish someone was duping a weapon I gave a shit about...
---
If you're on PC I have the plan for the outfit.  I keep my vendor stocked with them for 100c, but I just give the outfits away because they're easy to make.
---
I agree.
---
I love the grind, but with kids, house, other real life things... It's nice to be able to aquire things that you know you'll never see.  I get to play during nap time. So I get maybe 2 hours a day, if I'm lucky.  In that time I try to get my score stuff done, I try to get scrip for nodules (finally got my first unyielding ss piece yesterday) and kill some stuff.
---
I already had a b3325 handmade and a b1090 fixer, but b2525's.... Sure! Let's go!
---
Guides are guides. Still gotta put in the work to level up and get the SPECIAL and Perk Loadout, and get those Chems and Foods stocked up.
---
Lol is this your first MMO?
---
I carry multiple secondary weapons to give me more flexibility, have a furious radium rifle for mid range and either my gauntlet or furious explosive double barrel shotgun
---
lol hating on facts
---
A level 300 comes up to you and drops a TSE HM or  TSE laser ect. 
---
Out of 100 new players , how many are going to not pick it up  (obviously ignoring the fact they might not understand the perks) 
---
But out of 100 how many do you think are going to ti turn around and send a DM saying "nah sorry mate , il find my own weapons"
---
I‚Äôm a massive hoarder, always in my excavator raider suit sniffing the ground for loot. Loot loot
---
i joined one late, somehow, was already round 2, caused some issues, candy bucket wasn't where marker was. and the "screams" from mask were very infrequent.
---
I've noticed that with my 2 shot Gatling, wasn't sure if it was just that gun tho, good for sbq.
---
I have god roll weapons and armor and I've been playing this game off and on since beta. I've been consistently playing this game again since Wastelanders. Having god roll gear might make *you* lose interest but that does not apply to everyone. 
---
Not everyone needs a shiny new toy to chase to stay interested, if that were the case for the majority of the playerbase the game would have died long ago.
---
To actually use those guns, to explore with friends, to grind for gold, to grind for modules for good weapons you can‚Äôt dupe, to grind score for rewards, to keep collecting plans, to build amazing camps, to keep testing the limits of what else is possible in the game (like flying, building underground, etc.). I could keep going. I‚Äôm over 2k hours in and no one weapon would ever get me to quit playing, because I enjoy ‚ÄòPLAYING‚Äô the game, not just owning some rare guns. Duping doesn‚Äôt negatively effect anything for me on a personal level in this game and I strongly stick by the notion that if it does, it‚Äôs just jealousy. But that‚Äôs just my take
---
And Vault 79!
---
I think I'll just stick with my executioners for now then, thanks!
---
&gt;If you don't mind me asking what do you do with the rest of the time you're playing to be at rank 35?
---
Really depends.  Usually I am on a server with friends who are launching nukes at the Queen and in between launches I am doing other events that pop up or doing my farming route for legendaries and XP.  I have a route that takes me through all of the locations that give me good max level legendary drops that I like to do and it gives really solid XP. (i'd be happy to share the route) I do not use a bloodied build for unyielding armor but I do run 15 intelligence in special points and stuff like egg-head for extra intelligence and I have been taking advantage of the recently buffed cranberry relish with carnivore for even more xp. 
---
You are right that Bethesda has statistics on this stuff.  They have engagement experts who literally are paid to tell them how to arrange stuff to make them the most money.  As someone who has grown up working at a family owned business and someone who know works and helps run that business I cannot fault them for doing something that every business in the world does: Tries to make the most money.
---
This is perfect, and what I thought it would be. Not this perk coin bullshit
---
dumb question, how do you change the group type? I looked the other day but didn't see an option for it
---
Which is?

Rifle Gaming did a bunch of videos over just nuking random spots. Check it out if you feel up for it.
---
Don't run Bloodied until you get a Bloodied weapon.
---
When I transitioned to Bloodied, I got my SPECIAL lined up, I started getting the Perks I needed, and all the while getting the Armor and Weapons I'd need. Once I had my equipment, that's when I flipped the switch on my Perk Cards and lowered my health.
---
oh sure it's not a hard and fast rule, but I think it applies enough to mention.
---
Yes I would like if you and your buddy's got banned if you where duping or contributing to it.. and I do understand that you want a big cool gun or what ever, but getting a duped weapon that you didn't even grind to get is really poor and kind of cheating your self out of a good gaming experience..
---
No problem, reason I don‚Äôt like two shot is because of how it affects the spread of the bullets
---
Everyone who plays on PC (game pass / Bethesda launcher / Steam) play together, so yes you can play with your Steam friends.
---
I want persistent workshops like imagine if you could take over the free radicals and every hour a horde of 50+ super mutants attack you
---
You do both. The game kind of makes you do the original first since you have to be level 20 before you can do the bulk of the new stuff
---
Server hop till u get about 10 daddy-o, day tripper, mentats, psycho ... take 1 of them bounce out of ur inventory and back in n take a different one ... rinse n repeat usually takes between 5-10 to get addicted
---
God yes. Fun fact: Kills after you die don‚Äôt give EXP.
---
So if I nuke five people after I die, good for me! I get nothing! 
---
I‚Äôm actually starting to get good too.
---
not bloodied..
---
It makes the noise but doesnt make two, only one.  If it works for you, lucky you, but I've had no luck with gauss miniguns and super duper.
---
I'm pretty sure it has to do with the fact that it runs a roll for the effects, thus negating the perk.
---
okay thanks a bunch
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care if you lose loot to the games bugs. Why would they care if you gain loot from the games bugs.
---
You are wrong. But that's ok. Like I said, people are not going to like this post. Even though the whole subject of bloodied builds, duping bloodied weapons ruining the economy and all that are post all over this forum. I mean, it's not like people are talking about say, Troubleshooter weapons. Or mutant slayers like they do bloodied and then junkie. 
---
But hey, it's very in to ignore the obvious evidence if it works against you.
---
Only there's no work involved. It's all just time and pushing buttons. That's it. Sorry but the whole, work and video games isn't something I accept. Leveling happens no matter what you do, save standing around. Make some boiled water, XP. So yeah, not really work.
---
My hot take is I don't feel like the intent was for a typical player to ever max out all the Legendary Perks.
---
Think about it, in movies its cool when you get a team of assembled with specialized talents aka the best of the best, but when one person can do everything its lame.  If I'm the master of exploding palm technique, I'm ok with not also being a master infiltrator.
---
I‚Äôm wasting my time here, if you people could just look things up on YouTube and spend 5 minutes seeing how to make some caps it‚Äôs actually a lot more simple than you think
---
"We" gave them enough hints in the past year, some modders even pushed them with their noses right at it but they still wouldn't get it. Simply because they don't *play* the game but *cheat* themselves through whenever they have to test something.
---
Ah thanks! Anywhere in particular best to get hold of those?
---
Yea. I had it for 3 months. Then cancelled when Beth removed player vendors due to dupes. As protest to get there shit together. I re activated as soon as they reopened. As much as I can't stand paying ¬£11.99 a month. You get more than ¬£11.99 worth of atoms. A very very useful tent. That saves me thousands on caps. And the stash box. Need I say more?
---
Defo worth it. If you can afford it. Ideally I think if they charged ¬£6.99 a month. They would get a metric ton of new sign ups.
---
While playing on PC, you will be able to play with any other PC player, regardless of the launcher‚Äôs platform. All of these versions of the game use a Bethesda account to log in and play and will be what you use to add your friends in-game.
---
Go to social menu, switch to the tab where it shows group members by name, right click on your own name (work if you are the leader ofc).
---
Out of those 100 new players how many of them are going to understand that the weapon came from ill-gotten means?  
---
That's even the situation I'm speaking of anyways.  There are many players in this game who are collectors and traders and farmers and have worked their asses off to acquire collections and other gear through legitimate means.  This i just a giant kick in the nuts to all those players because it completely invalidates all the time and effort they put in because someone else can get the same exact or better stuff just be exploiting and cheating.  This makes people want to quit.

---
Ahhh ok, yeah I‚Äôm starting to build a collection of the other chems I just can‚Äôt seem to find enough of them all and alcohol

But dont you want a sense of pride and accomplishment?
---
it's for latrine usage...
---
Most player vendors sell some of them
---
I genuinely fell asleep once playing that gamemode
---
Albeit I hadn't slept for about 36 hours but sitting on a cliff waiting for enemies for 10+ minutes since my team seemed to be glued to the bushes tipped me over
---
except that applies to every other legendary prefix. are you ok? do you know what meta means?
---
if it wasn't bloodied or junkie's then there would be guides for whatever the next best prefix is.
---
F NW. Worst game mode ever since EAs battlefront heroes v villians
---
As a Blood Eagle, I‚Äôm partially thrilled... And partially in pain from lack of sleep. Luckily, I have chems to keep the grind going.
---
Even the Vim ad light-up poster is in there
---
As someone that went out of my way to avoid trading at all , this entire time. And has spent more than 4K hours building five characters that are all fully kitted out. I will definitely not do all that grinding again. If they wipe it all, I had my fun, got my money's worth. Although I do like to have more time to enjoy all the work I put in. Not gonna do all that work again lol.
---
I think you're confused.  You get the most XP from staying alive and it's easy to get more XP from mobs than from killing players.  NW is about staying alive and killing mobs, killing players is just there so you can keep more mobs for yourself.

Make sure you have it,I don't know how the challenges work but I've seen easy challenges pop up that I know I would've already done had I seen them a week prior.
---
I generally just dump sacks of stuff off at the vault. That way, if it gets poached, I don't know and can pat myself on the back for doing my good deed of the day.
---
U could always grind for the pleasant valley tickets like me and try ur luck with the pita rng n get all the fancy guns ... I‚Äôm only missing 2 to have a complete set ... the assassin and zealots fancy revolvers
---
I would much rather it be that then "win a game" or "kill 5 players" I HATE Battle Royale and am rubbish at them. I dont want to play it to even begin with.
---
Actually watching it now! Unlike many people who complain on here, I am always looking for other perspectives. Notice I waited until now when I was able to feel it out a bit before complaining, I didnt just jump on the train because of a few posts with bad math. This post came from my personal experience. I am not trying to just be inflammatory and whine for the sake of whining.
---
For the rep stuff, I also included the photo op mission, but you have this many fast travels:
---
To Foundation
---
To the radius
---
Back to Foundation
---
To Crater
---
To the Hunters
---
To the retired raider
---
Wrens mission sends you inside sometimes so thats an extra loading screen
---
Back to crater
---
To Davenport 
---
To location 1
---
To location 2
---
Back to Overseers house
---
So maybe if Im lucky and find everything VERY quickly, and get lucky with short loading screens, MAYBE you could do it in half an hour, 1 hour for 5 characters is impossible, if you have a video of that I will believe it but that feels like a pretty big embellishment.
---
Reminds me of a random scene at a ranger tower. Where you find a baby‚Äôs grave with my little angle written in block letters on it. Made me. Instantly sad
---
That town wouldn't know what to do. The population is like 60 people and it more than quadruples for the festival. Check out Rifle Gaming's video about Helvetica Fasnacht on YouTube
---
Well said. I've seen dozens of threads just like this, and I've love to see dozens more. This just isn't feeling like a video game anymore. If they carry on with the grind and RNG being the focal point of the game, then releasing the CK and modded servers is the one and only thing that can save the game.
---
Freezer would be great and it's a good suggestion with a thaw system. It could be similar to how crafted alcohol works. When you pull it out it's frozen and it has a condition bar that when expired, it turns into the original item. There could even be an equivalent system like the fermenter to accelerate the thawing.
---
Agreed.  I noticed that sometimes when fast travel fails, a tiny error message slides onto the right edge of the screen but it‚Äôs removed so quickly you can‚Äôt read it.  Since there are only two conditions I know of that can prevent fast travel - being over encumbered and being near enemies - when fast travel fails I assume I am near an enemy.  Try running away from any nearby structures and crouching.  It seems to help
---
times a few million, every month?

yes

Only workaround i heard that works is so you install gamepass FO76 in same harddrive/partition as your Windows. Too bad i only have 120GB SSD as Drive C and i barely got myself 62GB free space, i don't stand chance to get 75GB for FO76.
---
Haha i wish i could clip that long on my xbox but i dont have a capture card or anything but i promise you its possible.  When i get a more free moment here at the office ill come back here and write down exactly what i do
---
honestly people here will make every excuse for why everything NEEDS to be a grind and that each new timegated limit is just the best thing ever. disagree, youre an "entitled" asshole who wants everything to be instant and free. and its always the same crowd too, that clearly post on the sub more than play the actual game.
---
bethesda sits on their hands and dont fix bugs, take months or years to add BASIC QoL and then add more and more monetization, and what? people arent allowed to get frustrated? lmao no. have a critique, the answer is "why even play the game", that or your post just gets borked by mods for "rule 10" irrespective of the actual substance of the discussion
---
devs dont interact with the community, and clearly have NO idea what even one part of the community wants.they dont even do the little dev notes that they used to do in patch notes last year. they developers need to meet up with actual players and play the game with them. they need to do it boots on the ground style, because even if they take a look at the sub or the forums all they will see is people suggesting things, and the other half of people trying to tear that person down because they dare suggest something is crappy about the game.
---
if the dev cycle for content featured community feedback earlier in the process, i think it would help to prevent thinks like the ammo converter, and other updates from being absolute flops due to disconnect. that, or the game should take a more user driven focus and the devs should give players more agency and tools and just get out of the way and just sell cool skins.
---
TL:DR
---
 devs dont interact with community ever, and fanboys defend bad design making existing feedback impossible to parse. player agency is being stomped and its hurting this games potential.

No. You can‚Äôt play your Xbox character on pc and vice versa
---
I like and dislike this strategy, i like it when people who do this are in solo teams or premade with their friends, i dislike it when i get people on my team sitting in bushes with no gear or just spawn and afk. I completely understand it not being fun, personally i dont like the "kill 9 creatures" i find it easier and more fun to focus on a match and win rather then find these creatures, but cosmetics shouldnt be locked behind a game mode.
---
Do you keep the outfits and anything you get from the atomic shop?
---
Fastest 15 seconds ever
---
What video game in the last 10 years has a manual?  LOL
---
free to play mobile game limiting in a premium priced game is utterly evil. Its even evil to put it in f2p games, but less heinous. It is exploitation plain and simple.
---
Oh yeah the game mode is pretty horrid, but if you play it enough to get the ghillie suit you can spend entire matches hiding in bushes and people will walk right past ya. I hide in a bush with the ghillie suit and then look at my phone till the game lets me know the circle is moving. I even won my first ever match of NW hiding in a bush, a scorched beast killed the last guy alive.
---
(That‚Äôs only when I have I play it for a challenge though... I avoid NW as much as I can.)
---
Legendary Power armor pieces have been datamined from the purveyor ever since she was added to the game. And when she moved to the Rusty Pick, there are more PA pieces  in her shop. So it‚Äôs quite possible they‚Äôll add them, but we don‚Äôt really know when
---
Still not as good as the scream in the Ulduar raid of World of Warcraft.
---
That chick being tormented by Yogg Saron.
---
Ah I hope this isn't the case I'm in the same boat I don't have enough space on my c drive
---
It‚Äôs not like you have to have it in your CAMP or anything
---
The settlers should be scared shitless of 76ers as we use Nukes, you know the thing that destroyed the world, for fun, shits, and grins, or just to kill the mother of all the mutated bats. Where Foundation is located, they should be able to see the mushroom cloud forming in the bog ever time we drop one. they should be afraid of us, not cocky assholes who demand we kill someone for a water bone saw that they have 20 in reserves, especially since we tend to drop nukes back to back, FOR FUN! They are either so mentally far gone and desensitized that psychiatrist would declare them mentally insane immediately, or the shit they "experienced" in the pit and DC was so awful that not even nuke happy, mutated, chemmed up, walking death machines and Mutated flying bats that turn people and creatures into crystallized, hive-minded mutations phases them. 
---
I mean come on, some of those settlers were around when the Bombs dropped, and us using them for fun doesn't scare them, then they are mentally gone
---
You don't get a lot of SBQ in by the time you're 65, especially if it takes a year.
---
Just whatever version you have. Xbox with Xbox, PC with PC.
---
Smiley (and bethesda) disagree, decides you can, instead, only buy bullion with scrip, and purveyor only accepts bullion bought with scrip, not that other, identical bullion...

/s (i hope)
---
My primary weapon is a 3* Instigating/+50% Crit dmg/+15% faster crit meter Lever Action Rifle. With sneak perks it deletes pretty much everything from stealth in a single shot.
---
My back-up weapon is a Furious/+50% crit/-25% AP cost Combat Rifle, built to be automatic. I dropped three Commando Perks into my build to increase its damage.
---
I used to use my LAR almost exclusively, because it was so effective. However, ever since the VATS hit bug was introduced (that seems to be worse on the LAR than any other weapon) I've been using the CR much more frequently, to the point when I'm considering just switching to a Stealth Commando build instead of Stealth Sniper.
---
I need 1 too
---
Go to Bog Town. Top floor of 3-storey brick building. Enter by roof.

It's a screw mine.
---
Atomic shop resets when the weekly challenges do, new week new stuff.
---
creature-specific gear is not necessarily bad. it's just that you'd have to lug around, and source, multiple sets of armor and weapons.
---
The sheer horror of coming home from school on Monday afternoon and having ones Mother say, ‚ÄúYou forgot to turn off your Nintendo, dont worry I turned it off for you.‚Äù after grinding a game since Friday still gives me goosies. 
---
A players progress/inventory imo is the ONLY thing a game needs to get right as it is a representation of their TIME, the true currency of any game. üç∫
---
Still trying to find my perfect energy weapons.
---
Damn my eyes for not getting an explosive laser rifle back in the day.
---
Ok best of luck i hope it gets sorted for you. Why did you cancel if you dont mind me asking, for curiosity's sake.
---
The dark cherry wood floors build budget glitch. It‚Äôs since been patched, but I planned for a long term camp with storage for extra decorations and tons of other stuff. This gives me flexibility to change stuff around as I want to keep the camp feeling fresh. Cause when you use build budget glitches, you can no longer add to the budget once you log out, which means no new wiring or stuff in displays, so that turns a lot of people off from the start.
---
Yeah, the only useful handmade I‚Äôve ever gotten was that exact same thing. An AA FFR. And that was only like a month ago that I rolled that at the purveyor. If they had something like weekly events where it guaranteed you a certain type of legendary weapon then I would have more of a problem with duping. Like one week you could complete an event for a legendary unarmed weapon, the next week it might switch to a legendary pistol. Then Rifle. Etc. But the lack of content to keep me engaged while having to rely on rng is too boring to handle sometimes.
---
Oh no... did the internet break your concentration ?
---
ü§£
---
Yeah it may come in a future update. Looking forward to seeing what Bethesda has in store for us
---
They they get to have the acknowledgement they got theirs legitimately,  ever day I run about 3x sets of 3x queens , I drop all my 3* at watoga station and keep my 2* for scrip ... other players take what I drop 
---
QE fixers , Bloodied DCG , All kinds of shit cos I have my BFFR 50.CAL and my BFFR fixer already,  I dont care for giving away my stuff,  and I dont care what everyone else has got
---
Cheers
---
I guess what I'm asking is...  Some xbox games on the xbox pc store play as xbox games.  Some play as pc games.  I was trying to figure out which this one was.
---
Wah.  So you would rather hunt people, and the rest of us forced to hunt AI mobs in it when we don't play NW at all?  Get over it.
---
Perhaps because stats don't lie and the community often does.
---
I get that. We want communication to go equally both ways. I‚Äôm just saying that the CM is put between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the flow of communication because they can only share what is confirmed by the dev team. I just want to make sure we aren‚Äôt blaming CMs for things out of their control. 
---
But again, I hear you and your frustration. I hope more dev AMAs are done to create more open lines of communication.
---
You gotta buy them dinner,  which is usually some circuitry and lead scrap. 
---
They don't enjoy movies, but do like repeating, long patrols in dead silence.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox but thank you so much though! I‚Äôll keep hunting there‚Äôs loads of places I haven‚Äôt looked in here now
---
No direct or overly close nuke landings
---
Yesssss I‚Äôll start looking later thank you!
---
I have gotten 3 ss pieces of unyielding armor with just 45 modules in total. How? Well if you ever see you got a unyielding piece from a drop there are high chances, You will get that desired first star effect in that same server. Try it out.
---
Ok, that makes sense. Thought there was a perk or something that made it possible. I just did an underground build and would have enjoyed being able to add a bit more to it than what is there now.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox or I‚Äôd take you up on that! Thank you so much
---
And why it should matter to anyone else , I dont have a clue , so you have a DE gat plasma,  if I turn up to a queen with the same one , are you gonna be pissed ????
---
But wouldn't the fallout still destroy nature? In the rain and such?
---
I would honestly be shocked if it were more than 3 people.
---
you could do a chargeback right
---
I can't tell you how many times I've died to molerats or those little ant bastards that hide in the grass! I used to not be able to do the queen as a bloodied build because I didn't have anything to survive the rads, because i use Radicool I always radded up for that sweet +5 str
---
What terribly selfish reasoning.. if you and your mates are duping I also hope you get banned.
---
Someone‚Äôs said to check where the ski outfits used to spawn (they‚Äôve swapped) so hopefully I find it now!
---
Oooh I‚Äôll keep my eye out!
---
Some people might say it‚Äôs is part of mods because you get Xp  for it. I just wish they add more pvp modes, like a team death match or even a pvp hoard mode, I think they have some similar in destiny 2.
---
Maybe this new adventure mode could be called Fallout 5 and be a single player game. Because creation engine should never even try again to pretend it is a multiplayer engine that is capable of preventing these non-stop glitches that occur.
---
Amen to that. And if someone else uses an OP gun he duped, why does it make the game worse for me?
---
Ok brb. I‚Äôm going to go make a handful of B2525 fixers lol. The weapons don‚Äôt represent time anymore since anyone can make them out of thin air
---
and no matter what anyone tells you...
---
... yelling "Open Sesame" into the game mic does NOT open the sealed vault doors.

[edit: word]
---
Idea for newbie ‚ÄúWelcome to Appalachia‚Äù kit:
---
10mm pistol
---
100 rounds
---
Vintage Nukashine
---
Good luck, kid! Wherever you end up.
---
I haven't seen any for 1k. Point me to those vendors.
---
I‚Äôve got a better idea of where to look now so will check that out, failing that I‚Äôll ask on marketplace or something if anyone has it (after checking vendors)
---
They could disable caps
---
Narrator: ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt.‚Äù
---
I do this often!
---
The kids store!! That‚Äôs clever, it‚Äôs the one place I haven‚Äôt checked yet
---
Yeah, the budget seems to never be enough. Just keep an eye out for the next build budget glitch and plan ahead! To get to 2x max with the glitch I used, I had to build for 10 solid hours and pray to Todd I didn‚Äôt get disconnected even once, or it would have fucked everything up. It was such a stressful build it legit gave me a headache the entire next day. But if you plan right, you can maintain a fully lit over budget camp and still slightly change it up whenever you want.
---
Map is far too big.  Not starting with a weapon is bad.  Ammo is bad.  Using your adventure mode SPECIAL stats is really bad.  Your wheel often not working and often not being able to access inventory is really bad.  Being able to nuke an area at the end bigger than the safe zone is bad.  Access to radaway etc. being random is bad.
---
I honestly can't think of anything positive to say about the mode other than the ring of fire effect is neat.
---
This, exactly.
---
&gt; This game feels more and more like a second job. 
---
I'm at max caps on 5 toons across 2 accounts (mules). Have max gold on 2 of my 3 playing toons, bucketloads of t-notes and just spent 4000 scrip from 4 toons at the Purveyor. 
---
If this was a second job i'd be better off than in my actual, first, job. So, Beth, can you make this a second job please, I could really use the ~~caps~~ cash and gold.
---
Technically that's wrong. By the Monorail Elevator there is at least 2 Nuclear Bomb Craters. I don't know if they were targets, or test sites. You can tell they were nuclear because high radiation.
---
We used to have this , back when we has survival servers,  complete the challenges and you got unique named 3* weapons
---
Depends. The jetstream carries the air from South to North along the Atlantic coast, so there may not have been many Nukes to the South of Appalachia gone off and the ones to the North (Capital Wasteland) would have their fallout carried away. Look at Chernobyl, although not a nuke, it didn't completely devastate nature from the fallout in a huge radius from the plant.
---
i have another bad news for you , Spoiler Alert!. &gt;!This game is about Atomic Shop. And money, money, money. When you make a complain about anything in Atomic Shop they respond immediately, but when someone broken whole player market dont get even ban. Play as you like and never ever expect justice or something. !&lt;
---
oh, and also the Camden Park token machine, and the Monster Mash Candy Machine...
---
... though it's random, it's possible
---
Wait they fixed the shadowed mods? First time I‚Äôm hearing of this... Wonder what would do my full unyielding urban scout armor better? Polymer or Shadowed mods?
---
It means a ticket has been created within their respective bug/task tracking system be it Jira, Rally, or otherwise.  However its priority depends on many factors.
---
That's right. Appalachia was hit, but just with a few bombs as we know of. And probably bombs with much lower yield than what would be dropped in the DC area.
---
History is bound to repeat itself and Bethesda, Bethesda never changes...
---
If I'm not on a fence or someone's tent during SBQ I get killed by the bugs in the grass.
---
There's actually a lot of people who swear that a mix of creature specific gear will make you overall more tanky than something like vanguards.    Troubleshooters on armor for encryptid is OP actually.
---
(looks at Bikini Atoll)... meh. dunno.
---
Yeah, i managed it as well, on 2 accounts, but it was a pain in the arse. i got lucky on my second toon as i managed 5 creature kills in one match and the rest in the second, but it took about 5 matches on my first. That's an evening I could have spent with my wife.
---
Actually, nvm, thanks Beth, this is an excellent challenge.
---
Smaller sized nukes, like the ones used by players in the game.
---
Ahh ofc silly me I have quite a lot of scrap stored so ill befriend them all of coursee
---
I don‚Äôt necessarily agree on that. You don‚Äôt need a bloodied weapon to run bloodied. You definitely want to wait until you max serendipity and nerd rage though. You want starched genes maxed as well for adrenal reaction mutation. I‚Äôve got a level 110 bloodied stealth commando and I have literally one bloodied weapon and that‚Äôs a bloodied explosive fast reload black powder rifle. So it doesn‚Äôt even fit my build really. I normally use an AA handmade or assault rifle since that‚Äôs the best things I have right now. And I still one shot nearly everything.
---
I just want to get max *Reputation* with the Raiders and then wipe them and the Settlers off West Virginia. Clean the land for the truer faction the BoS and my fellow working brothers and sisters of Vault 76. I don't care if Vault-Tec used us as guinea pigs, we as dwellers are better than what they intended for us and much better than those self-entitled raiders and settlers.  
---
We SHOULD unite Seven-Sixers!  
---
P.S: Damn settlers took a workshop from US! (THEY TOOK OUR JOBS!) They are first in my list!
---
Im sure someone here will come up with every reason why the developers shouldn't communicate with the players and why communication is actually bad for the game.
---
They already defend each increasingly ridiculous grind and shitty timegates too death.
---
here are r/fo76 you are not allowed to have any opinion other than "fallout 76 good, bethesda good" no complaints, only buy more atoms
---
Yes, the most successful way of minimaxing is counter-intuitive. Sometimes i think - "who made an error?" Someone who made this helpful perks (having a healer in the party is classics), or someone who made possible "emergency measures" like nerd rage, unyielding and so on to stack up without diminished results...
---
Clean slateeeeee! üñ§
---
My support for the clean slate is *completely* independent of this idea, but.. Move towards a Diablo/PoE model with a Season/League! Clean slate, lasts for a set period of time and then characters get transferred to the main server. Make Legendary Perks more akin to Paragon Levels. Nobody really cares about the main server under this model, anyway. More like a character graveyard, but more than enough people to be perfectly playable for people who aren't willing to let go of their progress and start on a new season. On Diablo 3, i repeatedly started new seasons - but on Path Of Exile I didn't want to so I just kept on playing with the Standard server after the league ended and it was fine.
---
But honestly, who are we kidding? As long as the developers are amateur enough to let this keep happening *time and time again*, any mode will swiftly be ruined by the RMTs and the other people looking to exploit it.
---
Ugh, stupid.
---
I'm sure the opportunity to fix this with underground bases will be missed.
---
there was one that was made by that one company that made gaming strategy guides. IIRC, the cover said that they would be updating the guide as 76 updates, but I think they went under before 76 launched
---
I've seen multiple copies of ban emails so they definitely are Banning people this time around.
---
This will solve nothing.  Duping will still happen.  If they ‚Äúremove‚Äù what ur stating the next meta will be duped.
---
dont worry about it man, the video helped me feel a LITTLE better about half of my argument, but we'll see, its still tough to be motivated to log on each day JUST to do tedious challenges for a couple hours. But thats only half my argument, the time commitment, but also the fact that it just isnt really fun, they said its stuff youd do anyways, but I have not found that to be the case, picking up things like concrete and aluminum you have to actually go to monorail elevator and the jail to get those, may require some server hopping further lengthening the process. The fact that the game has become logging on, fast travel around to 20 different places just to pick up bullshit or talk to one NPC for the rep missions, it just is not a good gameplay loop. If the repeatable held a bit more weight and I could just focus on grinding events and things it might be a little better, but tbh those are getting old too.
---
Yeah... point us in that direction...
---
Very strange indeed :/
---
I've got a few bloodied weapons already that's what made me make the jump to the build, just still holding out hope for the glorious bloodied handmade or fixer
---
Yes. There's even structures in the craters like military hardware and Vertibirds. I believe it was a target more than a test site. I haven't seen any lore on importance of the sites.
---
Hell, I think most 100+s don't even know you can share cards.  Some teams I'm the only one even sharing anything.
---
And Bethesda would lock your account for doing it, so you've still lost something.
---
They have full control over who plays, no matter how much they spend.
---
True. Also running Bloodied Melee without a Bloodied Weapon works. If you've got full Unyielding and Radicool the massive boost Strength really ups your Melee damage.
---
eh, should i be that far down the track already?
---
I called customer support, then called again, and again. Finally i tried phone-tracking down Todd, but my speech just became incoherent screams to the tune of the fasnacht music. Sadly, no one was able to help.
---
'Testing will begin shortly.'
---
Oh, I believe from other comments it's on gamepass for both Xbox and PC, so whichever you want to play on. There isn't any crossplay though.
---
Stupid is,as stupid does.
---
Maybe they didn't see the Clock in the top corner ;-)
---
I just want to bring Mort to my CAMP.
---
In a 99.99999% PvE game with basically no difficult PvE, why on earth do you care if Bob down the street does "too much damage"?
---
I'm level 335 and have been playing since December of 2018. Bought all the bullion items I wanted and got max affinity with settlers and raiders.   
---
Loved the Wastelanders story but once it was finished I am stuck doing the same events over and over for score cosmetics I don't really want.
---
Just time for a break and will see what comes down the line .
---
Other PC players, there is no cross play
---
I wish camps got the same build area and at least the same budgets as workshops. with workshops, you can create over 6 big neon signs while in the camp you can only create 3. workshops have such a huge budget that goes unutilized due to no one wants to spend the time and resources to build a kick-ass base that they are going to lose due to leaving the server, server crashing, or game crashing.
---
Sounds mad to me
---
they said it plays with pc people, from steam and also bethesda launcher
---
I've found it's fairly fun to collect groups of items, I would at least to Robot Figurines and Teddy Bears. I collect Magazines and Bobbleheads as I go along. Some other stuff like Mr Fuzzys are also nice to collect, plus the "Clean" items like the Umbrella and other "Clean" items.
---
Here's a thread on collectible items if you wanted to look.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cskz3h/collectible\_checklist\_for\_your\_display\_cases\_20/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cskz3h/collectible_checklist_for_your_display_cases_20/)
---
I suppose it depends on what you run and who you team with.
---
If you‚Äôre teaming with lower level folks, Bloody Mess would be useful, as would Lifegiver.
---
Those aren't large enough to be nuke craters. Maybe large mini nukes, but not the ICBMs that irradiated most of the world
---
I mean, a full set is like sentinel/cavalier pre-nerf. but a single piece is just 15% less damage. I'd say it's still better compared to vanguard's though, since damage reduction is better than damage resistance. but still.
---
to be really effective you'd have to be changing pieces all the time.
---
Thanks.  That's what I was assuming, I just wasn't sure.
---
Yeah, I'm constantly on the LFG page and no one is giving out or even reasonably selling duped items. Seems this dupe isn't as easy as people are making it out to be, and currently there is no flood of duped weapons.
---
Not at all. I've done some intense grinding that's why i'm this far ahead.
---
Obviously we need to re-nuke appalachia, and start this whole mess over, maybe we all become level 1 ghouls, or super mutants, or just irradiated children of the atom. 
---
maybe we de-evolve the world, lile how the mad max series became more and more  savage as time went on.
---
Agreed, this system runs contrary to my conscientious objector playstyle.
---
because there is already cap limit to another normal things like scrap, vendor caps, gold bullion, ... and other "obviously" limits its maybe too much.
---
oh god, even when they catch someone they punish him for temporary ban. This shit boiled my blood every time.
---
I have an extra bloodied handmade that I'd happily trade away for some other fun weapon.  However, trading is too terrible in this game and I won't risk being ripped off again.
---
Ah ok panic over, I‚Äôve only been doing the dailies and weeklies.
---
Ok buddy
---
It has a high rad resistance
---
It was in the roadmap
---
oh, duh, they're doing the mad max thing. As the (film) series progressed, everything De-evolved into a rundown savage monstrosity....
---
.... or they just shrugged and went with whatever they felt like
---
Platform? I can probably help. I stockpile chems.
---
I hate the Wastelanders. The next one of those cowards that mouths off is gonna taste the back of my X-01 gauntlet. It‚Äôs Nukashine flavored. Who knows where they‚Äôll land?
---
Not a bad idea. It still allows for late progression without simply handing it over immediately nor making it still like an impossible hill to climb.  
---
There's probably a bit of retooling that could be done, but as far as a starting point goes it's a good one.
---
It makes people want to quit more when they‚Äôve played since release, acquired thousands of legendary weapons and never gotten what they want. You could‚Äôve acquired 10,000 legendary weapons since you‚Äôve been playing and gotten 50 god rolls. I could‚Äôve acquired 10,000 legendary weapons and only gotten 10 god rolls. There is no ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù to what you earn in this game. It‚Äôs random. I can spend 2 minutes getting a free duped weapon from a player while you could spend 10 seconds killing a legendary enemy and get the same weapon. It‚Äôs not like you completed anything specific to get the weapon you wanted.
---
Thank you. This is great!
---
Combat rifle, no scope, with suppressor.  The fast fire rate allows you to cope with getting swarmed when you lose stealth, and the suppressor allows you to make less noise and regain your hidden status faster after you kill off the closer enemies.
---
For backup melee lots of folks go with a big axe for the damage, but if you go the gladiator route instead, the serrated combat knife is fucking boss.  If you combine it with the perk card that increases swing speed, you are a rapid-fire stabbing machine.  A good companion for a stealth character.
---
"good feedback, ill pass it on to the team"
---
The shovel has a very satisfying THUNK sound.
---
Yea just went to it there got destroyed by a snaggy something. But yea there is a LOT of loot.
---
(waits for legendary golf club that sends mobs flying into distance)
---
Surely it was meant to be so: unyielding kicking up when you are beaten to near death to let you sirvive...
---
Us 76‚Äôers will make a brighter future above ground
---
Yeah not talk too loud about this. Or we will get "bug" fix on next patch and chasis will count the weight of parts.
---
Nope, shouldn't need to.  Terrible Idea to make leveling up every single day a challenge.  And sucks for anyone that already has 5 characters and wants to keep them all.
---
As another player who enjoys Nuclear Winter I can handle it when they are reasonable quests, but not when they're ones like pick 3 locks and everybody is rushing for the same safes over and over. I can stand killing 3 creatures since I can do so without much issue, but 9 would only ever happens if I get a whole team and we are taking over at the end killing everything in sight. Same thing with rezzing. It's rare my team sticks together well enough that I have an opportunity to rez without trying to work things out to kill ourselves on purpose. Deploying your CAMP 3 times is just kinda stupid, but at least easy. The quests need to be simpler so people are actually encouraged to try Nuclear Winter because this is not working, it's just screwing up matches and people's days.
---
Remove all caps and limits and make S.C.O.R.E. easier to earn.
---
Have done 10 different rolls trying to get a Junkie's GMG but so far no luck. I did however get a Bloodied FFR/VATCRIT one that I would love to trade, but sadly, can't. I guess I will hold on to it if I ever decide to run a bloodied build. But for now I am still hoping for the Junkie's.
---
Had the exact opposite experiance just recently. 
---
Guy same level as me (108) runs in during a defend workshop.
---
Thought I had help.  NOPE!
---
He has a magic gun and literally 1 shots me, then waits at the workshop.
---
I leave and go about other business 'cause I lost and that workshop is his. 
---
Half hour later looking at the map, workshop is still listed as mine??
---
BUT do still love the player base.
---
Most everybody is helpful or at least not hurtful.
---
I'm to tired to read the post but I'd definitely duck with some Legacy serves where all items and such are stuck on that server
---
Not large enough to be nukes but maybe large mini nukes? Pretty sure any crater from any nuclear warhead is a nuclear crater. Besides, they other player that suggested this may be player nuke sized may be right as the actual nuke itself is smaller, and we don't actually have craters from ours due to game design.
---
My guess is either Modus or small scale Communist attack.
---
"temporary bans", or banning their fake accounts existing only for duping purpose? 
---
yea thats satisfying...
---
I appreciate your generosity but I am on pc.
---
And then theres the people like me with a new character sprinting to the wayward to get my level up lol
---
Yeah!
---
Weapon crafting, collecting junk and listening to my Communist collectrons message 24/7. Selling of propaganda flyers to spread the word. You see some very creative base-building in this game. Love the possibilities, true rpg
---
Not that a shovel weighs much but it is just lower weight @ 0.8 pounds
---
I‚Äôm ps4!
---
I use full troubleshooter, first aid 3, refractor and I can hold 3 for about 10 seconds- what am I missing?
---
Hold up where are you seeing them for 1k each ive been lokking for some and i cant find it all i want is a BE flamer
---
Its only 250 score it would have been far easier to grind exp to get even more score with the repeatable 10k experience for 100 score
---
This worked. Thanks
---
Notifications haha....  I once made the mistake of tracking the Daily challenge to collect 50 water.  Im pretty sure the notifications are still rolling in.
---
Vampire weapon, high ROF.
---
Just kill 9 creatures, it's not that hard lmao
---
I saw that challenges could be seen while in NW matches, woupdnt it have been easier to do it from there?
---
I've seen other players report that they've submitted cases and been told (in essence) "Sorry about the bug nothing we can do \*shrug\*"
---
Why not just make the other prefixes better.  I have seen some good ideas like mutant's gives you +5 or 10 damage per mutation, make the other ones a straight up + 50 % bonus stuff like that.  Fix berserkers some how.  IDK.  But I do know with the correct perk load out and the right chems and food even non legendary weapons can do some serious damage.  I do  a junkie's build now and I love it.  I can be OP at times but other times I can plain blow myself up.
---
So do people hate builders or i hope that you meant the people who make traps.
---
Wrong sub buddy
---
Dumb for many reasons...
---
As someone who recently discovered how to do a real bloodied build (I used to think 250 damage on a two handed melee was a lot), I can attest to this. The number of times I've died at SBQ, only to respawn in the nuke zone (I don't wear PA), and despite all my extra agility and perks to run as fast as possible, the rads kill me before I even get out of the nuke zone that's like 100m away is ridiculous. Even with all the right perks upping your DR, and things like Serendipity which means you get hit less often, I probably die just as often as I did without it, if not more sometimes (like when VATS decides not to work). It does take skill to keep alive (especially as a melee build where I'm literally running into enemies).
---
right on!
---
Yes the good old MMORPG Worldchats. Put a "WoW was the first MMORPG" in the Worldchat,take the Popcorn and enjoy.
---
He is right though, bloodied isn't the reason for the duping.  People duped other things: Christmas presents, Plans, shoot the original dupes focused on duping tons of colas to earn tons of caps.  
---
PVP was imbalanced from the start, before bloodied became the meta.  They had to nerf assassin's and sentinels gear shortly after launch because people could sit there with Assassins/Sentinels gear and take 0 damage. 
---
People grief because they are assholes.  Most people don't even grief with weapons, they do it with things like nukes, exploding bait, or trap camps.  Others exploited things like how some mines would cause radiation damage to players with passive on, or how you could hit a player and trigger mutations and start PVP.  It had nothing to do with griefing. 
---
And Meta is going to happen no matter what.  Some people like a risk vs. reward build that one shots a lot of things, and go after bloodied.  Other people like to go against meta (such as myself) and have sets of Ghoul Slayer gear because a full set gives you 75% damage reduction vs. ghouls, and stacks nicely with Blocker, Lone Wanderer, and Sentinels gear and then I go farm legendaries from areas that always spawn ghouls for basically 0 effort on my part.  Some people do like getting troubleshooters gear to do silo runs since it's always filled with robots. 
---
Many people still enjoy their TSE weapons.  A minigun with furious is going to be doing the +50% bonus damage very quickly, putting it on par with Junkies.  A sniper may use instigating since it deals 2x damage that's just as effective as a full power Bloodied. I've seen people talk about "full health" builds that use Vanguards and Vampires to keep their HP way up so that they are walking tanks.  A lot of people complain about PA, but other people are doing just fine with the 42% DR it provides, combined with Emergency Protocols and Stabilized to play the game. 
---
There are a lot of possible, effective builds. You can "complete" the game with a hodge-podge of crappy gear if you wanted to.
---
Team Rocket
---
You're an idiot. Down voted and moving on.
---
I was running an events team last night and a level 3 player joined the group.  I fast traveled to him to drop a lot of purified water, stimpaks, and plans.  I got there and he built a house with no doors and was stuck inside.  After laughing, I talked him through how to delete walls or modify them to a doorway.
---
And all three are supposedly janitors.
---
Oh ok I get it. He'll only reach the last space on the last day. I took it as he could reach the last space before the season ends and if you didn't pass him, you're out of luck. I knew it was just a little gimmick for fun. Thanks.
---
But it's a motorcycle with 16 times the detail! It's not at all what you asked for, but I know you'll enjoy it!
---
oh they are new people, look up the history of Bethesda Austion studio. They were busy developing their very first game when Bethesda told them to scrap it and put them to work on 76. This is the result.
---
I liked fast traveling directly to the 'Welcome Mat' like they had in FO4.  I have a welcome mat in my house and people constantly end up stuck in the concrete floor somehow.  I have moved the camp station around but it hasn't helped. Please put people on the welcome mat or give us an option to do so.  That would be stellar!
---
I just want to don my paramedic jumpsuit and run around saving lives üò≠
---
Same. Ill hop on and get you some. Same psn as here?
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was the only reason for duping. It‚Äôs just one of the items that gets duped a lot. There a big market for it. There‚Äôs no denying that.
---
same problem for me, its pissing me off
---
You have a lot of nerve claiming someone else is wrong when your post is full of so much bullshit.
---
Yes, there were definitely changes made. I‚Äôm having same issues as you
---
30000 missed events. Jeez man that's dedication haha
---
Wow quite the epic tale! I always seem to get dropped into matches with a full squad of level 300-400s wiping the floor with everyone.
---
I'm all for dealing with dupers, (so the title is really confusing), but your solution is really rough. Just wipe everything and release an entirely new game? I don't think that's remotely a possibility.
---
Wouldn't the best solution be an option to turn of receiving shared perks? It seems a really simple concept unless I'm missing something? I don't know why Bethesda didn't implement something like this straight out of the box, some cards are weird and I wouldn't want their effects either. I feel bad for both people in this situation the one just trying to be helpful and the person having their build ruined
---
I build my commando alt on damage type specific handmades.  They were cheap to get and since it's my second play thru I know how to plan a farming route and just pack accordingly.  I eventually got a AAFFR FR for cheap but I still keep the others.
---
How much do you make duping? Is it like a line on you income for your taxes?
---
From as far away as possible, and always planning out my sprinting escape route before I open fire.
---
From *The Usual Suspects*: "How do you shoot the Devil in the back?  **What if you miss?**"
---
Creatures arent very common in NW.  There's only a few areas with guaranteed creatures on the various maps
---
Sounds like someone doing counter propaganda to preserve theirbdupe
---
The limit on currency boggles my mind, instead of a pay gate it's a time gate, I'm almost done.....almost.....
---
I actually really like the way it is now except they should really bump up how much coins you get per card scrapped. That being said I'm fairly confident that a level 300+ player has played a little more then "a few months". So even if they change it to what you propose it's still going to be one hell of a grind.
---
The dupers are going to ruin the game, they could just disable the vendors from buying. Just like player vending machines.
---
Executioner‚Äôs. Either one will be one shotting most enemies on the map if you‚Äôre low health. Executioners will give you better accuracy (fewer bullets will miss) have better durability, and do extra damage on bosses when you lower their health.
---
If you think there's nothing different between a weapon gained by breaking the TOS and a weapon earned from a legitimate drop then we will not see eye to eye on this.   Just because you couldn't get something doesn't mean it's ok to cheat to get it.  If you don't like the rules or the drop rate just quit playing and go play something else instead of duping and cheating.
---
&gt; wipe everyone's accounts
---
I've been playing since B.E.T.A. and I am a fallout 1st subscriber who still plays regularly.
---
If they did this I would be fucking furious and quit immediately. I would also never play another game from Bethesda.
---
Yes - and if *his* boss has decreed that he only gets 10 people to work on the project while everyone else is on Starfield, there's only so much he can do.
---
I made the number 10 up, and in reality it's probably a lot higher than that - most of BGS Austin is supposedly on this. But they lack the core of devs with multiple projects on Bethesda's engine under their belts that BGS Maryland has, so maybe it's that he only gets 10 BGS Maryland folks on the project.
---
Chuck as much ammo in them as you can, they'll bite! After Events like Scorched Earth etc, folk will be looking to stock up quickly, before the next Event. Might buy a few other items while they're there!
---
Oh is it one of radio drama? Those are good too.
---
Move the game to your OS drive
---
Bethesda: \*introduces terrible grind and RNG\*
---
Some players: \*dupe and exploit their ways around it and sell their items to a frustrated community\*
---
Bethesda: \*surprised pikachu face\*
---
Hey ... i'm one of those little bastards. And I have no idea what the hell is going on.
---
you probably won't be able to play it
---
all the free to play meat sellers would just die from the injustice if such a dastardly pay to win mechanic such as a freezer was implemented
---
Thanks for that.
---
Like i said when you are grinding the events you have it done like Clock Work.
---
Even those Glowing Wolves have turned in to Bullet sponges.
---
Thanks for the offer but I don't really enjoy XP/legendary farming. I do enjoy it when a team does back to back scorched earths though. 
---
Like you say can't really blame Bethesda for trying to make as much money as possible, if that's what the statistics support. I just wish there was a way for weekly players to have the same progression as daily players by putting in the same total play time.
---
What platform are you on? :)
---
Just delete this. They‚Äôre cheating, it‚Äôs wrong no matter how you try to frame this ethically. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter that they ruined the economy‚Äù is an all time bad take.
---
I'm mean and toxic in 90 percent of the games I play but I volunteer for rescue work in real life
---
from what i can tell, the only people they are banning are ones that have acquired hundreds of certain items in short periods of time. i.e. if you duped a few items or received a duped item, you will not be flagged.
---
afaik there is no other way for them to trace dupes, so they are hitting those that are being blatant.
---
holy molly.... you used a lot of words to tell that you have nothing to say....
---
not enough room
---
Full set of ss gear a set of t65 the cosmetics in the legendary run
---
Due to the way this dupe works, I can't see it being fixed any time soon either...
---
Check out the credits in game. FO76 has quite list of assigned resources.
---
Like I said, they need to make their choices, same as you have to make yours. It‚Äôs a video game.
---
there will always be a market for meta gear. you're not making sense.
---
I've found the spawn rate for events, especially public events, is inconsistent. I've been on servers where I haven't had a break, and others where not a single one spawns over a 1-2 hour play session.
---
Even if they made it so that there was a limit of maybe 2 events at a time (minus ones that users start, like workshop events, Encryptid, SBQ, Shotgun Caravan, etc), and make them all free fast travel, might increase the number of plays at some events. Since SCORE started, I've seen a lot more players at certain events, which I think is the whole point of events.
---
Leave Bloodied, remove or cap Unyielding. 
---
The problem with Bloodied builds isn't the prefix itself, it's the ridiculous amount of synergies that stack with it. Rather than trash the playstyle altogether, start with removing the +15 to all stats that every single Bloodied build gets. 
---
It's bad enough they get insane damage; getting huge XP bonuses, AP pools, crit bonuses, selling bonuses, and increased carrying capacity (and +str-based damage) is insane.
---
Drop Unyielding, and Bloodied builds are still stronger than other builds (i.e. Junkies, stealth sniper, etc), but the risk/reward factor is more in line across the board.
---
So armor I don't want and is pretty much useless
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnYWmgSZdlM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnYWmgSZdlM)
---
This happened to me too and when they said they cant credit score, i replied to ask if theyd give atoms to make up the gap in the levels i missed by not having those points. still waiting on a reply
---
Well I was more trying to say that no one else should either.
---
Agreed.
---
Why is it useless and how come you wouldnt like the best defense
---
It is stupid hard to get, always used T60 legs.  Now I use T65, which are better then the ultracite now.
---
That bitch, she sits up there in her ivory tower with all the nice clean appliances. We get a clean sink to pacify us, screw that I think I will nuke her ass this afternoon.
---
This right here hit home. I came out the vault made something out myself alot of hard work trying to be the good guy helping people to be treated like shit by the crater and foundation. I done a hell of alot more for them then they ever will do for me.
---
Looks stupid xo1 looks cooler and the armor isint good enough for the grind
---
It's not just the 'economy' it's straight up cheating. It's supposed to be extremely difficult to get that perfect weapon or armor. That's pretty much the endgame. I don't even really care people do it, but how is that even fun? Any game I ever use cheats or godmodes for I usually just quit, what's the point of playing then?
---
That being said, use of exploits are laid out in the TOS. Everyone agreed to them, exploit the game system, you might get banned. Not to mention what it does to server stability for other players.
---
Was just there, plenty of people begging for duped items and European filled servers. The usual scammers are there offering their b2525 fixer for trades but no dupers selling or handing out anything. Feel free to let us all know when someone is so we can all get in on it.
---
I haven't even figured out how to access those cards.  Can anyone help?
---
I've also found that VATS has been acting up again. I'm a bloodied melee, so should be able to one-hit most enemies, but it sometimes takes 3-4 swings in VATS before a connection is made. I know 95% doesn't mean it is a guaranteed hit, but it happens way too often.
---
Probably, though it likely varies a lot by discipline. The original plan was to have BGS Austin handle just about everything post-launch, but in 2015 they didn't exactly have BGS Maryland's core of devs that have a lot of experience building content in Bethesda's tools. They've posted a lot of job openings in the last few years, so it looks like they've been trying to build the team up.
---
My suspicion is that BGS Maryland chipped in on Wastelanders but is now basically fully committed to Starfield at this point.
---
I can agree on the t65 but the ss armor is stronger than heavy combat without any upgrades
---
i am wondering if Armour in general is broken.
---
Running in a full set of unyielding,with a secret service Chest piece..
---
And supposedly having 550+ damage protection.
---
It is insane how much health a Ghoul takes if it slaps me.
---
If a Gutsy jumps out and gives me a quick burst i am done.
---
I think armor is pretty pointless if it does nothing when you really need it.
---
Don‚Äôt ask questions you don‚Äôt want answers to
---
Damn you, now I need one, was only after DC Gauntlet before......
---
Vault 76 on the map looked like a string of holiday lights yesterday with all the new players coming down the hill.
---
no offense intended, but man, that was a painful read.
---
This is the main reason why i quit after 280 hours. During quarantine (like 2 months) i had infinit amount of time to play but after i realised that the game felt like a chore. In begining the game seemed very fun and i felt like bethesda is on the good track. I was wrong. Too much grind, to repetitiv. It feels like this game was made just to stay more in game so you have bigger chance to use the atom shop.
---
It is exploration because they know there is literally no alternative. Don't like it? Don't play. That's literally the only option. They make it hard for you to enjoy the game. They make it hard for you to want to log on. 
---
Its not even like some of the stuff is locked by atoms. It's straight up strictly so you log on every day even for a couple minutes to get your gold.
---
some people from a dataminer discord claim to have cracked the rng. but no actual info was ever posted.
---
Bethesda doesnt ban that much, you should be safe.
---
You‚Äôre proving my point. It‚Äôs your choice whether or not you use exploits. It‚Äôll make the game less fun for you, but that‚Äôs your choice. Not mine. You might get banned, that‚Äôs your choice, not mine.
---
Friendly fire and a shishkabob, medics auto laser with crit damage, and  suppressor perk is my go to support load out.
---
Just use a sneak buikd and it makes all power armor useless and since the dupe of fixers theres no point
---
I‚Äôve noticed this lately too. I haven‚Äôt done anything to actually test it, but I seem to have gotten much squishier since Patch 20 dropped ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt good because I don‚Äôt seem to be doing as much damage, either.
---
&gt;There is no way professional people cut mess up this badly over and over and over again.
---
Laughs in capitalism
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not the best with words, but I wanted to put my two sense in.
---
Yeah that true but the ss isnt power armor and you do get caught
---
same...it's usually the first strike in VATS that consistently misses, no matter the percentages
---
It took me three hours to do that one challenge. I had some fun learning how to play NW but just trying to find creatures without getting killed was super frustrating.
---
I'd like to know as well.
---
This also plays into the fact that we don‚Äôt get nearly as many radstorms in West Virginia as they do in Boston. (They really got pummeled if they‚Äôre having them after as much time passed for FO4.)
---
My rep quest daily routine.  Disclaimer:  All 5 of my characters are at max rep so I do not have to do anything extra for the extra rep.  I do this for 9 quick notes on my alts.  
---
All of my characters log in and out at the overseers house.  This is where you start.  Log in, go inside to davenport.  ALWAYS pick crater.  2 of the outer areas they make you go for pictures you don't even have to move from the fast travel site.  (black bear lodge or Colonel kelley monument).  If you get small campsite its an extra 30 seconds or so as you have to fast travel to sacrament and sprint to the camp.  
---
After this, I immediately go to crater and grab my 2nd quest and take the 2nd picture.  So i usually load in to my private world to do these, this means for me, my quest markers don't show up right away.  So at this point, i have my pictures taken   and I have my raider daily but I don't know where to go yet.  Instead of waiting for it to appear, I go turn in my davenport daily.  By the time I am done turning that in, the raider quest objective is up.
---
So there are 2 raider dailies.  If it's retirement plan, great. This is the easier of the two, I just go to the quest in my pip boy and hit show location and fast travel to the closet possible point to the former raider.  I don't talk to anyone.  As soon as they are in my sights I gun them down and fast travel back to crater.  Quest done.  If its importance of communication, i just pray I don't get the prison as this takes the longest.  If it's wavy willards, this is the best.  Either way I grab the tubes as quick as possible and go back to crater.  Don't go in by where Meg is to use the tinkerers bench.  Even though the game tells you to use that bench there is one up in one of the space station arms near one of the vendors that is on the way back to wren almost.  
---
From there, it's instant TP to foundation to see Ward.  I immediately grab the quest and hit show location on map.  So heres the thing about this daily.  There are multiple different locations of where the circle can appear of where you need to look, however, if a circle comes up in a certain spot, the thief crew is always going to be in the same spot in that circle.  For example.  The one that makes you go west of whitesprings, the thief will always be next to the watchtower.  Once you know this, this quest takes about 60-90 seconds to do.  roll up, kill thief and all hostiles and port back to ward.  Turn in daily, done.    
---
I hope this helps.
---
About to download it and play it today!
---
No you dont with full bos unyielding
---
Just got a Bloodied Faster Fire Rate Faster Reload Gauss Shotgun... on my automatic rifle's build. Just because I cannot find a use for it without respecing does not mean that it should be tradable, or the reverse, that every legendary should be untradable
---
Duping causes multiple issues, due to encouraging activities that force lag onto servers and potentially even crash the servers, and are against the Terms of Service. Same with RMT, also against the Terms of Service and harm the game long-term.
---
Yeah, I can sign off on that.
---
This hugbox mentality is embarrassing.
---
Player vendors and train stations
---
Have you ever played Fifa?
---
Why don't you just be kind then instead of being mean and toxic?
---
Ill start looking there
---
I've been through there at least a thousand times and there's no way to manipulate it. It is what it is and it's completely random. On a private server your first run is usually the worst. After about four hours the server will stop spawning legendaries.
---
I was wondering because I heard that extra unarmed damage is like 10% each so it should show a difference in damage
---
IDK but I feel like it's definitely not completely random since Seasons started. It seems all I get dropped since it started are Assassins, hunters, and stalkers weapons when before it was pretty well balanced. Also I've spent as many rolls trying to craft my last UNY SS piece as it took to roll my first 4.
---
Train stations
---
I have also noticed the VATS acting up.
---
Have you had any experience of actually increasing enemy health shooting in VATS ?
---
That has only happened a couple of times though.
---
Id yeah I own to sets of sentitinal unyielding if they walk right up and bump into you they find you
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
Then maybe stop coming back for now and force them to change.
---
Level 1200 minimum.
---
Im level 320 and have had a few hundred hours played. I started as melee than completely respeced into a stealth rifle build than completely respeced into an unarmed/heavy gunner build. So ive spent a fair few level ups swapping special points around and missing out on perk cards. So im already falling way behind.
---
There gonna be dead before they bump into you
---
To be fair anyone can legit make thousands of any type of ammo.

Have you ever played a competive game online or in real life where any form of money is involved
---
Being curious about this myself, I decided to do some research, which involved rewatching the Making of Fallout 76 documentary, the Bethesda Game Days Wastelanders panel, and reading the in-game credits. Please note that as these sources cover multiple years of development, some team members may have been reassigned or left the studio.    
---
Studio Directors:
---
-Doug Mellencamp
---
-Yves Lachance
---
-Ashley Cheng
---
(Ashley Cheng is situated in Maryland and may have moved on to work on ES6 or Starfield. Yves Lachance is situated in Montreal and may have moved on to work on ES:Blades or ES6)
---
To my understanding, the Studio Director governs the scheduling and workload of the other departments in the studio. Their influence on the game would be limited to funding decisions.
---
Project Lead:
---
-Jeff Gardiner
---
The project lead would be in charge of the big picture, and of co-ordinatingt the departments.
---
Lead Designer:
---
-Chris Cummings
---
The Design team would be the ones making decisions on how a certain feature would look and feel for the player. Feedback regarding things like the Legendary Perk system should probably go to them.
---
Lead Level Designer:
---
-Daryl Brigner
---
Lead Quest Designer:
---
-Ferret Baudoin
---
Lead Programmer:
---
-Jason Hasenbuhler
---
Lead Gameplay Programmer:
---
-Eric Sebesta
---
Lead UX Programmer:
---
-Don Etgeton
---
Lead Server Programmer:
---
-Roy Fleck
---
The above are the people who I believe would have the most direct impact on the game. There are other team leads such as DevOps, Art, and Infrastructure, who work on things behind-the-scenes but I expect they would only take feedback from the other teams.
---
Below are a number of names that I can say for certain do play the game, as they regularly stream the game on Bethesda's twitch Channel.
---
Senior Community Manager:
---
-Jessica Finster
---
Community Manager:
---
-Devann McCarthy
---
UK Community Managers:
---
-Neil Gorton
---
-Robert O'Neill
---
-Ophelia (Surname unknown)
---
Australia Community Manager:
---
-Jonny Roses
---
better to wave the chainsaw around when approaching freshies too
---
true randomness is impossible. there *is* a seed. nobody never bothered to reverse it, though.
---
I‚Äôve been seeing that a lot of VATS shots just don‚Äôt register. Additionally, with so many players now showing up for events, my sneak bonuses aren‚Äôt counting, because enemies are aggro to them. This can also happen with NPC‚Äôs just being in the area, Radiation Rumble being a prime example.
---
I played a lot since Wastelanders and bought tons of gold bullion items and got max rep with both factions. This was during all the Covid stuff so I had plenty of time to do it. 
---
The legendary run isn't bad on its own,  it's just me being tired of the same old events and the timegating on legendary scrip.  I love legendary hunting and running my shop but there isn't too much reason anymore. 
---
Wastelanders was awesome but once you finish the content you get Riding Shotgun, Rad Rumble, and a few boring dailies.   
---
Tldr: I  have my SS set, Solar set, Fixer rifles, preferred outfit, and tons of wealth in cosmetics,  weapons, and plans.  We need new stuff to do!!
---
there's a real jekll and hyde going on behind the scenes i imagine.  generally, it seems though, that the modus operandi for gamemakers is not a fair price for a good product, but what is the most amount of money we can make for the least amount of work.
---
fork-knife and fifa got everyone salivating and thinking they can emulate those shitty sales tactics.
---
Absolutely - heck, I often tell people to go and read the credits myself.
---
But unless those credits have been updated recently, I take them to represent resources allocated *up to release*, i.e. before the game launched. I definitely agree that BGS Maryland did a lot of work on the game up to November 2018. What I'm suggesting is that since then they have probably been focusing on Starfield. And if Starfield is coming out in the next 12 months, the help BGS Maryland did manage to give post-launch is going to get even scarcer.
---
If that's your take away, then you're clearly not paying attention.
---
a shitty product, or lack of perceived value will make people not spend additional money.  I've completely quit call of duty franchise for that reason. They would get my money every release, every DLC, and each series within the franchise... Once the offerings became sparse, and they did nothing to curb the cheating, I stepped away. It's not a lot, but on average two releases a year plus DLC? A couple hundred bucks a year they won't get from me anymore.
---
What's being said is that if they took the time to polish up the product, people would be far more likely to spend up on content, new releases, etc.
---
They don't even have to do a lot of work identifying the problems. There's a community that's passionate about highlighting them, and with less than 10 minutes reading you can get a handle on what the top five problems with the game are.
---
same problem here, keep posting and hoping they fix it!
---
Yeah people always said Activision was money hungry imo they were just stupid they actually started being money hungry with MW
---
I usally keep weapons like this because they are fun to play. I have a bloodied mr handy saw blade, this thing is hillarious to play and the damage is also nice.
---
I‚Äôm going to use that from now on
---
Like compete in esports?  Hmm no unless you can count my one appearance at an MLG event for Halo 2 because it was in my hometown like well over a decade ago.  But I do watch a lot of competitive games on twitch.  Are there some toxic people?  Sure.  With prize money on the line tempers will flare and people will lose control.  Most don't though.  And it usually seems that the players who are flaming and on tilt play worse than the ones who aren't.
---
Means the same thing as when I tell my kids "we'll see".
---
At least for 1000+, you'll only need about 160,000 XP to level up every time and there is no longer the need to grind more and more after each level.
---
I think I'll go for the Legendary Int rank 4 perk first the moment it is released.
---
That's what she said.
---
‚ÄúWe are investigating‚Äù.
---
Any? Or there is a favorite one?
---
I believe the Ghoul is more rad damage vs. physical damage and Mr. Gutsy has armor piercing rounds so he does not care about your armor.
---
Hopefully they will fix it because it does seem a bit rediculous
---
It's probably both tbh. Unfortunately if they annoy people enough they will leave. Wouldn't you rather finish the content and be eagerly awaiting new stuff?? Seems like a no brainer to me, from a company perspective.
---
Wait...  Is putting it on my OS drive the only solution?  That's a terrible design!  I've avoided FO76 like the plague since it came out because a fallout game without npc's and all that comes with it?  No thanks.  But now there are wastelanders and it's on game pass so I'll give it a fair shake and try it out.  Maybe my incredibly low expectations will be surpassed.
---
...
---
Can't play because NoRegionPing?  Not looking like a good start Bethesda.
---
Lol I'll be on today if you have any questions. On Xbox same gt as here
---
Even with the best weapons being duped, I highly doubt many people would be duping legendaries that aren't at least Level 30. Doesn't really help new players if they can't use them yet.
---
Whitesprings and Morgantown and the one in watoga
---
I do not believe they auto scrap. They do weigh quite a bit though
---
Armour just doesn‚Äôt work really at least for me. Dunno if it‚Äôs anew patch change or what. Basically it‚Äôs my perk cards that do all the tanking and damage mitigation. 
---
So much so that I completely stopped the armour grind soon as I got all decent unyielding. Haven‚Äôt even bought the last SS stuff because it‚Äôs kinda pointless. Only thing I‚Äôd have now is unyielding with AP regen for my jetpack but otherwise it matters not. If I take off serendipity I get melted even with 550 or so DR myself. 
---
There‚Äôs supposed to be drop off on DR returns after like 380 and it makes sense as I‚Äôm just as tanky in Chinese stealth armour as I am in my full getup. Only difference is the special buffs.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug that was intended and it would probably piss a lot of people off if Bethesda came in a changed it now
---
I‚Äôd love to form a ‚ÄúWastelanders‚Äù faction where we do quests for some other former 76 resident NPC who made it out and is sick of the Raiders and Settlers too. I‚Äôd join in a heartbeat
---
Mfw at the casino losing all my $in one hand
---
Poison resistance is actually quite good on unyielding pieces. It's one of the bloodied build's biggest weaknesses, and getting it on 2 or 3 pieces can make a huge difference.
---
For reference, SBQ's crop-dusting aoe is considered poison damage.
---
Yes. If you server-hop, game forgets that you sold the photos and let you return them to Davenport normally.
---
...do not like hos tongue-lashing, so i do this every time :-)
---
Got 8/9...play 3 more games and got nothing and gave up last night.
---
Yes I do. Otherwise I would‚Äôve have made this post. So your anger and insults don‚Äôt phase me one bit.
---
Yeah they need to fix that. It reminds me of ttrpgs that have to make systems for something, like making magic items, to explain how they exist and pricing, but it is impossible for players to even use them. Unless they also implement normal perk cards and gold ones to rain from the sky as rewards, they really need to lower those requirements. I think the card scrapping system seems fine, but the point cost for upgrades is obsurd.
---
I already have a (hopefully) legit legacy... but if I find a better... I dont know I would use it. Power is tempting and I am weak.
---
Oh and thanks.
---
Don't try to fart through it either...
---
I tried everything I could from guide man, nothing worked. I get a email back from Bethesda just after the guy here said move it to the os drive. Their email said the same thing.
---
I like it. every 50 levels you can open a slot or level up a card you already have. simple and easy.
---
there are those who are saying, "..level 1200 to max out all 6 slots," ...I'd say why do you need to max everything out all the time for everything. That's when choice, strategy comes in. You choose what perks are important at any one time.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 404 and only played 5 months
---
I keep hoping for amazing content, but it's just more pizza delivery jobs with a new form of currency that has a horrible exchange rate from the old one. Remember how everyone used to have a shitload of caps? 6000 caps for 300 gold, now you know why they call him Smiley.
---
If you have rare weapons that you traded for then odds are you have some weapons that were duplicated down the line at some point. They‚Äôve been out there since the beginning. If these types of weapons were never duped then people would never get rid of them. And everyone would be playing until level 1000+ just to get something like a B2525 handmade. In theory that‚Äôd be great for ‚Äúrare‚Äù weapons to be that rare. But there isn‚Äôt enough content to keep people around for that long if they aren‚Äôt getting gear they want.
---
...... You mean like how every single expansive and large video game attracts different crowds of players?.....
---
I thought you were being sassy.  Then I tried launching the game.  NoRegionPing.  It's true, I can't play it.
---
Possum, I will still grind WS on occasion but one suggestion I would pass on is to look for quality over quantity in legendary hunting and build tour own route.
---
I noticed while doing Beckett‚Äôs quest line and doing Davenport‚Äôs photo recon quests to Blood Eagle bases that I was finding a surprising number of 2-3 star Blood Eagles in these places.
---
Also I‚Äôve also found some reliable legendary farming in spots like the overpass by Clean and Safe and the train yard West of Watoga so I‚Äôve got some favorite loops I like to make that are quick stops.
---
You likely know about quite a few of these yourself and my point is I can add up my tally of Legendaries from clearing WS and it‚Äôs often no better, or even somewhat worse than just hopping around to my hotspot list.
---
Oh, and I don‚Äôt know if anyone else is seeing this but my last few visits to Westtek have been much improved. I‚Äôm getting 3-5 drops where I had been seeing only about 2 per visit.
---
Good Luck Wastelander!
---
The first part. Why should I have everything I've done in the game for a year and a half erased? Sorry dude but what you're saying is ridiculous
---
Unfortunately my g/f had the opposite experience the other day. She took the exact same location and got camped by some level 500 stealth shotgun build. She was level 50 or so and play pistols because they're fun. 
---
I log on and kill the guy a couple of times (luckily, I'm a PA bloodied heavy weapons pve build) and he talks shit how he was going to stay there all night if he had to just to kill her again.  
---
People like that have ruined the game for her. She's pretty much over it after that.
---
50% damage boost at 0dr. Best way is to get armour with the perks you want and let it break. You are much better. Off going with bloodied or junkies though
---
Or at the very least, if someone tries to create a new team, and there is already one of that kind, there should be a popup that says - there is already a team of this kind that is not full, would you like to join instead? The number of times I've been on a building team by myself, and someone else creates a building team of just themselves is a bunch.
---
Wait till you start the legendary perks. Yes they added new ones that are substantial but they added an additional cost. They removed the best way to gain coins to level them up and kept the rank up costs the same. One step forward 3 steps back.
---
We just need more camp loadouts.
---
At the login screen you get prompted to load in camp A, B, or C.  
---
While playing if you decide to switch camps you place your module and the new location becomes camp B. 
---
This would add so much to the game.
---
I just check where he was at for me and he‚Äôs way ahead of me lmao ugh
---
Why not both? I consider 76 monetisation a bit too far, but I still consider the game a great experience...
---
Just disable the social menu while in the trade window. Probably not that simple butbyeah
---
To a degree yes
---
But this would make them lost the bond they have. I know its not difficult to build back up, but causes a temporary loss of the buff.
---
Benefit: 50% increased damage if you have 0 DR (same as junkies).
---
Downsides: You can't use any DR items/perks/armor or your damage does poof. 
---
Workaround: Wear armor pieces and break them by taking damage. You will keep legendary effects but lose DR from broken pieces. 
---
Tips: Chinese stealth armor is like made for berserkers weapons. Easy to break and op at sneaking. There is no specific build for berserkers, just don't use anything that gives DR.
---
You got my vote, I totally agree.  My one add to this is do not charge me 100 scrip to randomly craft a 1 star weapon.  I would not care if they up the cost.
---
Definitely not always I can say from my 2000 plus hours some times enemies spot you that you arnt even aware of being there
---
Every time there is a dumb NW daily:
---
Time to cook up some cranberry relish and pay West tek a visit.
---
I see you have our ‚Äúmissing‚Äù property
---
Do you know what it is?
---
Or disable all user input after trying to join a server. But that's probably a client-side change.
---
When I got ss armor, I got the roll I wanted on first try first piece, 2nd try second piece, &amp; the other 3 pieces  I'm STILL rolling probably 200+ rolls combined
---
Yup, it‚Äôs crazy how the collections spit out pay to win items.  I got the Christmas one for free and have been winning for over 6 months.
---
None?
---
Yes i own a rr power armor shop and i need to know what items need to be restocked
---
Don't worry i catched up to him and smacked him for you. He will slow down now.
---
Good read -)) I literally laughed at how tiresome and pointless the game might be, so true.
---
I used to grind for flux, farming nukezones and SBQ half a year ago. I needed flux to feed my 50cal ever-craving for ammo. It looked like a nice thing to pass the time playing the game like this, but after a month I realized all I did was shooting things to farm flux to make more ammo to shoot things to farm ammo, rinse, repeat. By that moment I already had all the god rolls I ever needed so what I did was really pointless. Switched back to standard receiver since even then the damage was quite enough to kill anything. No more of that ultracite bullcrap.
---
After that my gameplay boiled down to farming atoms via dailies/weeklies and logging off for the day, waiting for something to buy in the shop to pretty up my camp.
---
Now, when you actually need to grind season levels just to get mediocre amounts of atoms it's starting to feel like a job, honestly. I projected to finish season in next two weeks, after that I guess there won't be any reason to play since I would not be able to get any more atoms by playing the game (I already completed all challenges except ones that require ridiculous time investments for a very small reward). Well, here we are, this is the endgame for me and it doesn't look very exciting tbh.
---
Well I can tell with my what 100 plus hours that doesn't happen
---
Still wouldn't hurt to look up from the paper and watch the reality for once
---
Another ghoul spawn in a small park under the monorail at the bottom of town.
---
I only use guns for SBQ and for if I'm doing the Easy events like Feed the People and am too lazy to move around just to kill a level 5 mole rat. In the former, I wouldn't know, in the latter, even my weak guns typically one shot them, so I've never noticed.
---
Are they cheating? Yes. Are they also keeping this train wreck of a game alive? Yes. Nobody is gonna play this game to level 1000 repeating the same crap over and over in hopes of finally getting the perfect weapon. The content isn‚Äôt there.
---
Yeah, this challenge was total bullshit. I didn't even try it because I've been to NW enough times to know that the creatures are very sparse. Some matches I don't even encounter any creature.
---
As much as annoying the "revive two players" challange is, it is part of the natural flow of the mode. Killing creaturs isn't.
---
I work in software development and if it is anything like my company. When someone says "they will past it to the team" they mean they will put it in the internal ticketing system. (Such as Jira for example)  
---
Then depending on the development standard (My company uses scrum) it will get put in a backlog, where it will sit until it gets added to a sprint.   
---
Depending on the bug, improvement, or feature request it could sit in that back log for months to years.   
---
Just looking at my companies backlog our oldest bug was reported a little over 3 months ago, but it hasn't been added to the sprint because the bug was considered minor and other more pressing bugs, improvements and feature requests have taken priority over it. It will probably sit there another few months before it finally gets added to the sprint.
---
Upping the arms race tends to creat even more problems and bigger imbalances. 
---
I have a furious fire axe, more damage with more consecutive hits. Also 40% more damage with power attacks. Returns damage when blocking. 
---
I‚Äôve got some perks for faster and more damage attacks, but not maxed. 
---
I can take out 80% of high level mobs 1-2 hits. The best I‚Äôve seen damage wise is over 1,000. 
---
That‚Äôs me not even trying to up my damage. I don‚Äôt use chems, just food buffs. 
---
So making something like those improved would make combat even less of a challenge.
---
Are you a bloody build?
---
I'm only asking because of a running theory I have.
---
Its still a bug that should be fixed.
---
I have 3 characters 3rd of them is a bloody unarmed and I run into the bug constantly where I cannot fast travel have to walk a bit and try again.
---
My main and second were full health builds. They almost never have the issue. But just a week ago I change my main a stealth sniper to use bloodied to boost his damage and now he also runs into the fast travel bug multiple times a day where as before maybe once a week.
---
My going theory is something to do with being low health and being unable to fast travel while taking damage, I think the game is often thinking the character is taking damage.
---
Is there armor cap on this game?
---
Amazing! My PSN is different, I‚Äôll shoot you a message
---
Can you get up on the Tea Pot without Marsupial or a Jetpack?
---
Pretty much same here. 3 of them damn near 3* god tier pieces.
---
Hey there! There are a few different things going on with this particular bug that have been difficult to narrow down. It's definitely on our radar and we're working on addressing it as soon as we can.
---
 path to englinment has a "hub"? sorry if this is a stupid question but I have done this event many times and Isint it just depositing bio fluid?
---
Was about to write up something similar, but you absolutely nailed it.
---
That said, "using data" does require some skill, so there are two nuances Bethesda needs to bear in mind:
---
1. Online communities represent a small fraction of the player base by count. But to accurately assess their importance you need to also think about their fraction by playtime and revenue. If your redditors are only a small fraction of players but play way more often and also spend a lot more money on average, then it makes sense to give them more weight. This would be tricky on reddit, but they could use data from their official forums as a first pass at seeing who is playing the game and who is participating on forums.
---
2. They need to be careful of selection issues: the data they have likely only represent people who already own the game, not people who could potentially buy the game. To illustrate: I'm sure their data shows that players don't engage that much with their PVP systems. That doesn't mean no one want to play PVP: it means that the people *currently playing the game* are not interested in the *current implementation* of PVP. It doesn't rule out the possibility that current players might engage in PVP more if the implementation was different, or the possibility that there are other people not playing the game that might start playing with a different PVP implementation.
---
They could give you a new card choice every 50 levels and a rank up every 25.  That would be fair and worth working for imo.
---
I dont hate your idea at all just tossed the last bit.
---
I honestly think they need to do away with scrapping cards and get the loadouts up and running. I like many of the 1 rank cards and use them situationally.

I really hope moving the game to the OS drive is not the only solution
---
nope. unfortunately my skills reversing things are pretty basic.
---
I supposedly have 550+ Damage and 370 + Rad damage.
---
I dont even notice any Rad protection in game if i am honest.
---
A Ghoul Slaps me it melts my health.
---
I do notice the Armour works really effectively if a player attacks me though.So much so that i can last a sustained attack,and usually win.
---
Bind your stimpacks to '1' ...Stealth + any ranged is ok. I am playing guerrila build, not bad, not worst, not best. If you are not looking for min/ max and you like to go against meta or tryin new alt, berserker suits well :)
---
Few tips :
---
\-max endurance
---
\-chems are your best friend
---
\-you will die a lot before you learn how to handle it :D
---
\- blocker, dodgy, serendipity also best friends, nerd rage is nice too ofc :)
---
I've booted this game up like 6 times trying to get past the errors and login problems and have yet to actually start a game. 
---
A main menu that loops you in and out of an error message with no way to quit the program? Dude wtf, fuck this game.
---
Hahahahaah **takes this game incredibly seriously having 2 accounts and multiple toons**
---
"This game feels like a second job"
---
i think OP meant Guided Meditation
---
‚ÄúYup, follow meeeeeeeeeeee...‚Äù
---
Oh yeah, the 4 wood and 3 steel scrap I get occasionally and the constant wanting to tear off my ears so much that I don‚Äôt even use the collectrons any more sure is Pay tO WIn
---
One fix i saw was moving it to the same drive as windows, but like me most people don't have enough space
---
It‚Äôs not that enemies are suddenly stronger. It‚Äôs that damage isn‚Äôt registering. One minute I can hit a level 65 scorchbeast with 2 headshots and they‚Äôll die. The next level 65 scorchbeast will take a whole magazine.
---
that would probably be it. it‚Äòs mostly coming down to bloodied and/or healing factor, that‚Äòs my theory aswell.
---
Ya. Lol. I'm level 330 and have 1200 hours in. Been playing since December of 18. Definitely more than a few months.
---
Also seeing the new watermill, which again is in a bundle only, and not like a cosmetic.
---
I want to watch them try to kill a firefly in VATs, I want to watch them keep firing again and again when the success rate is at 95% and they are like four feet away from it. God damn that bug is annoying as fuck.
---
(Not the Firefly bug, the game bug, though after five missed shots it does feel a bit personal)
---
Ohhhh. That makes sense.
---
Its sorcery_norz
---
Now your bs ing me especially since this game has a nasty habit of spawning dosens of scorched right on top of players and since I dont you walk from point a to point b crouching you are lying to me and I dont see what the point is also considerning for the whole month of june sneak was broken youve lied to me twice now I really dont get the point of this
---
honestly the beige camo underarmor if you play NW and don't have the ghille suit.
---
Yeah, sometimes for me too...
---
The only way you will get them to listen is by A. Making them lose money or B. Making them gain money. You dont matter or get listened to until you cause either of those events. 
---
And even then you aren't actually listened to, you are just seen as another number to balance.
---
Capitalism has sucked the soul out of everything it touches. No one really owns a business anymore because they are passionate about their work, you own a business because you realized you could make money off of it and **employ** the people that are good at it since they wouldnt be as efficient in making the actual money part. But since we have this atmosphere that the higher you are in the corporate ladder the better you are than everyone else, those passionate people never see actual leadership positions as the egotistical assholes shove them aside. Or if those people actually do make it to the top they get warped by the demands of all the others at that level with them and end up justifying decisions that they themselves used to struggle under when being made by the previous head honcho.

Yesterday I had a level 6 join the team I was on.  He was checking out a cargobot I had just shot down for a nuke card and he wanted to trade with me. Usually I don‚Äôt trade with anyone but I went ahead and let him take a look and priced a bunch of items at 0 for him to take. He immediately went to my full set of Troubleshooters armor and I just fast traveled to Silo Alpha. The funny thing is he followed me there and waited outside, the next thing I see is his arms waiving in the air since I guess the Yao Guai that sits in the lake got him. I just laughed it off and launched the nuke to find that he fast traveled to my tent in the bog. I have to give the kid some credit as he only died a dozen times to get in a few shots and finish the event. In the end I turned on my mic to talk to him and gave him a bunch of chems and weapons and escorted his overweight ass to the train station to trade them for caps. These new kids, you gotta love em.
---
Havent played in a month
---
Because they already had a desert game with fallout new Vegas. So they needed trees and bushes this time.
---
As it uses server lag, all you would need to do was trade and instantly pull your internet plug, or close the .exe on PC to dis the game, then rejoin and buy back gear...
---
That Stealth Armour is a lot of fun.
---
It is cruel that carry weight is drastically affected.
---
....You realize how easy it is to make ultracite ammo, right? And how much of it you can make in just 20 seconds?
---
Hahahahahah my whole post was tongue-in-cheek. Chill out.
---
The damage display is wonky at the moment. For example, I use a Ghoul Slayer's Explosive Gatling Gun that hits a lvl 62 bloated Ghoul for 143 + 13 damage shown by the floating numbers. That sometimes kills them with one body shot, sometimes with 6 body shots.
---
Were you running Adrenaline perk or Adrenal Reaction mutation? The perk is for sure broken at the moment which causes increased number of shots/condition loss on weapons.
---
Ok cool whatever you say bud sorry you got a lie to prove you point
---
Given that none of the items actually help you ‚Äúwin‚Äù, I‚Äôd say none. Those guns the collections give you get broken down to scrap at best.
---
Yeah. It takes almost no time. And unless you‚Äôre doing it right as an event is about to end it shouldn‚Äôt matter.
---
It sends a mixed message to players for sure, especially after the story quests are done, and exploration and events are what you have left to save up for the end game rewards. The game constantly tells us hang out in our big sandbox, jump on a team, stay a while and have fun!‚Äù Less than a couple hours later, the game‚Äôs hard limit parameters announce: ‚ÄúAaaaand we‚Äôre done here, see you tomorrow.‚Äù I am sure their daily player login metrics look great, until one day they start to drop off like every other mobile freemium game or tired MMO. If they were serious when they told us they want this game being around for the long haul, they really should be digging deep into how to improve the entire play experience, not just an executive‚Äôs favorite bar charts showing how many players login today and how much money the Atom store and 1st is netting them each month.
---
If I can get a chance to upload a pic I'll post my build. As for mutation: talons, adrenal reaction, carnivore, scaly skin, speed demon, and marsupial. I'll get the pic of my ranger build as soon as I can.
---
Maybe just use the licensing they already have in the game. The point is I'm pretty sure its a glitch that the jukebox ONLY plays classical music despite the music in the game
---
Instigating explosive hand made
---
well at least you‚Äòre working on it, that‚Äòs good. thanks for the feedback. 
---
you never came across that bug yourself? it might have something to do with bloodied builds and/or mutations.
---
Pick three locks was the killer for me I haven't got hours to just run around trying to find stuff to pick lock just stupid and then they give a completely piss easy one like place your camp 3 times such a joke
---
Not a cap per se, but there‚Äôs been a lot of numbers and investigation in the past and it‚Äôs generally agreed there are diminishing returns after 320-400 DR (actual number varies but it gels with my own experience around 380). 
---
There‚Äôs also apparent issues with resistances, as power armour gets hidden higher resistance to certain stuff, whereas you could get normal armour to as high as 900 and it be actually worse than good power at half the amount. Of course you‚Äôre then not getting legendary effects so PA still gets the shitty end of the stick overall. 
---
I basically rely on my perks to tank for me now and lost all interest in grinding armours as I‚Äôm bloodied and can tank most stuff fine anyway besides poison/acid.
---
I think you care a little more then me
---
How? lol
---
The water wheel? Takes up precious water real estate for 12 power output. Better off with an army of small generators and using that space for Purifiers.
---
I did thanks fot that duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Will edit it now. :-)
---
You really really don't want to be staying so low hp with berserker for serendipity or nerd rage to work.. If you get to those health levels you are already dead. Waste or perk points.
---
I only knew that because I still mix them up after 600+ hours
---
There are two viable paths for the Berserker's build, one using broken armor, and the other using level 1 armor with addictions to negate the DR to be 0
---
Overall the Berserker's build is not a casual run and gun because you're wandering around at 0 DR and are susceptible to a quick death if not paying attention.
---
### Broken armor
---
- Generally a mix of Life Saving and Auto Stim armor to either help keep you alive when hit, or revive when downed.
---
- Broken armor retains it's primary legendary effect, but may lose the major or minor attribute if that attribute related to DR/ER/RR/PR
---
- Broken armor has an effective DR of 0
---
### Level 1 armor
---
- Using 2 addictions you can get -20 DR to be able to wear underarmor and/or low level armor up to +20 DR (goal is 0 DR_
---
- Full set of level 1 light leather weighs about 2.6 lbs with ultralight. Wood can be even less, but has a slightly higher DR
---
- Carry around lots of different types of armor to be able to situationally mitigate against damage (full set = 75% damage reduction)
---
  - Zealot's - SBQ
---
  - Troubleshooter's - Encryptid, Silos, AWOL
---
  - Ghoul Slayer's - Whitespring
---
  - Mutant Slayer's - West Tek
---
  - Life Saving - wandering about the wasteland
---
Some perks that help greatly:
---
- Blocker - up to 45% less melee damage
---
- Fireproof - up to 60% less explosion damage
---
- Dodgy - up to 30% less damage at the cost of AP
---
- Revenant - damage boost on revival
---
- Serendipity - up to 45% less damage when under 30% health
---
- Mysterious Savior - really good chance of getting revived when downed
---
I've used both build types and prefer the level 1 armor route. I can face tank most events that have a single type of enemy based on my armor choice which is a neat feeling when running around at 0 DR. Attaining the level 1 armor was a long grind at the purveyor with a brand new character, so it's certainly not for everyone.
---
It's a cosmetic generator, just different model
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
The wasteland has produced another Raider.
---
Nope, stops people charging ridiculous amounts and RMT, they deserve it.
---
I noticed when more players are around the mobs have higher health. When im farming by myself, I've almost no issues like this. The VATS issue has been on for some time, so its not something new along with health regenerating mobs.
---
The backpack is 60%. The fridges are 50% like you said. But hold 10-15 items which count against your stash with no weight reduction.
---
With armor and perks, and a backpack you can carry so much more food that last so much longer. I literally only put food in my stash when I want some spoiled meat, because otherwise it takes a long time to spoil of I‚Äôm carrying.
---
Are the expansions super necessary for ESO right now? I just have the base game and also thinking about jumping back in
---
You are right.
---
My Bad.
---
\*Tcko standing by\*
---
:) I admit, blowing up cars is one of the more enjoyable activities...a challenge linked to it would be awesome
---
Yeah I started using it for nuke zones over PA because of carry weight issues, but as my build got finished the massive carry weight drop from like 500 to 360 when wearing it still kinda hurt.
---
Cheaters deserve a ban.
---
"I think I got a few million Treasury Notes still lying around... I'll give him 2"
---
No prob
---
Nah, I won't care until Beth nerfs my build. That's why I'm sitting on 40 unused level up points.
---
I'm going to be role playing a raider soon when I'm killing people like you does that mean I'm toxic ü§î
---
This comment right here is what they should pay attention to.  Both Bethesda and Bioware are on my only in bargain bin purchases.  You have to make your current job good before I purchase another thing.  This is basic good business practice and I don't understand how they don't get it.
---
People who RMT deserve a ban.
---
I tried maxing out "good with salt" and never went back 
---
Slows spoil rate down by 90%
---
I have made so many gourmet meals by now cuz my ingredients basically never spoil
---
'Sorry for the inconvenience'
---
That's why they should bump up how much points you get per card.
---
I didn't realise the backpack was 60%. Thanks for the correction. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Jesus no. GTA Online is much worse. If I ever hear the words "rooftop rumble" one more time I swear I will snap. At least with 76 you don't have to leave your gameworld to go into the missions (probably events are the closest equivalent) and there are enough different things to grind that it stays interesting. GTAO's entire progression became based on getting the next cool vehicle with $$$ or pissing you off enough you just get a Shark Card.
---
 It's at least possible to get the cool stuff in 76 by just playing, and if you don't care about having the new testicle powered submarine or flying car, there are other things to go for.
---
jaded I have become üòÇ
---
Definitely sticking with gauss, just got a two-shot
---
Jesus dude! I took a few month break here and there but I played a lot this last month and only went up about 40 levels
---
No dumb questions.    
---
One thing most players realize early on is just how small that 800 stash box seems.  Especially if you've got a lot of "junk" (crafting components."    
---
Bethesda seems to have limited your "free" storage space to encourage players to buy Fallout 1st, which gives you a separate "scrap box" that stores all your crafting components.  It has unlimited storage.   It's $14 a month, or $100/year...I think.  
---
If you plan to play this game frequently, I highly recommend it.  I couldn't imagine playing this game without the scrap box these days.
---
It's just a series of ones and zeroes, man
---
Same, but still :/ what build may I ask?
---
Once you learn how to strap that ice box to your back you can kill SBQ in seconds. You don‚Äôt even have to launch a nuke. She smells the freshness of your P2W meats and comes running.
---
No ps4
---
If you pay for Fallout 1st, you get the Scrap Box, which holds unlimited Scrap.
---
If you don't want to pay for a monthly subscription, get used to resource management. Bulk and sell scrap you won't need, keep common ones on your character (I rarely ever store Wood or Steel, as they are the most common to find). If you find you have a bunch of something that you never are using, best to reduce it to under 50 and get rid of the rest.
---
Getting perks that reduce the weight of items are very useful, but know these only apply when you carry them, not in the stash. Reducing the weight of aid items is key - I never stash any of these away. And unless you are saving a weapon to use later in the game (or for certain situations), it doesn't make sense to horde weapons, especially early in the game. You will find that once you start getting legendary weapons, you will rarely use non-legendary weapons again. Same with armor.
---
You will need only Marsupial. : -)
---
Then just Snipe the Critters as they Come using VATS.
---
When Wastelanders came out I dusted off my Responders firesuit to try and blend in a little more, at level 328 I guess it doesn't really matter
---
What it means is exactly what you're doing: "We're not the devs, so don't yell at us for what they do or don't." They pass along our criticism, then it's out of their hands. Don't be a jerk to them.
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
I've been playing 76 very casually for a month now, and can agree with you, now that I'm starting to get to a point where those limits are going to now affect me. 
---
I also have to gripe that:
---
- why are skills and such limited to s.p.e.c.i.a.l. and cards and not an actual skill tree, augmented by the cards as additional perks?
---
- weight carrying seems fudged up in this game vs say fo4. Like no matter what I do, unless I'm butt naked I have a hard time gathering resources withhout at least two or three trips to my camp and back to my quest area (if no stash is available)
---
- tick rate is too slow. Sometimes I'm glad it is when I get mobbed by a random spawn up but most of the time the enemy is literally dead before the animation catches up. The input lag therein is also detracting
---
What do you want me to say? That's how they were doing it early on, I don't imagine it's changed, seeing as the emails that have been posted directly address excessive amounts of items. When people got banned in Feb 2019, they said it was due to them acquiring hundreds of thousands of ultracite rounds in a short period of time.
---
Ignore the ultracite part if you feel you have to, I was just using it as an example because historically they looked at that.
---
when the vending machines/display cases were broken, people started dropping out of their subscription, and voila, we got a fix.
---
C.H.O.R.E.S. not registering?  lets wait till more people drop their subs before we even MENTION it
---
After i got all the swag from the blueridge event i figured why not...so i kinda rp as a blueridge caravan gaurd, equip with my own "blueridge caravan co" camp. Its admittedly pretty fun, tho itd be nice if i had actual end game content and didnt have to play make believe to have something to do : /
---
A responder okay with stealing &amp; cheating?! üôà
---
Because I've seen this, I'm going to run rad sponge and ruin every bloody food builds day with it
---
how do i shoot my gun?
---
Bloodied Stealth Sniper. BE Lever Action, BE Handmade, B 10DWA 10mm. 4 UNY, 1 Cham armor.
---
Lol true but I‚Äôm kind of tired of so many queen runs :/ so many nocturnal rolling pins have turned me to the dark side lol!
---
Omg omg omg yes yes yes!!! I love setting off car chain explosions!!! 
---
Omg I‚Äôve been thinking about what kind of other challenges they could come up with that aren‚Äôt just old atom point challenges!!
---
Yes we can agree on this.  Every player should follow the TOS we agreed to when we first fired up the game.
---
It works for me like a last chance, I am not running low HP.  
---
It saves my life time to time, but mostly idle, you are right.  
---
I am running Mysterious savior perk too :D It almost always does not work ofc, but when it does, I feel ready to challange my luck again ...
---
Yeah, unfortunately doesn't work for secret service as it doesn't have a shadowed mod, and Bethesda completely forgot about the shrouded mod for wood armor as it still doesn't work.
---
I'm spending all of my scrip on modules as I have been since Wastelanders.  I can't imagine that too many people get excited about the purveyor sales, especially since scrip is so limited.
---
I think it means it gets thrown in the huge, evergrowing, pile of tech debt. Would really like to see a 1-2 month break from content to fix all the bugs we have.
---
Im pretty sure challenges auto completing has been since launch(with many other bugs) but then they go and build a system heavily based on completing challenges, ignoring the fact it relies on something broken.
---
There is quite a huge story without the expansions, but both Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild are DLC, and I really wanted those haha.
---
It's also not too expensive if you get ESO+ for a month, you get access to all DLC except the most recent one (Greymoor) and there's a 10% xp bonus, double bank space and a crafting bag (sort of like that junk box in 76)
---
They're already discounted at 50.  All this brain damaged whining could result in is having them bumped up to 100 where they should really be.
---
"The team" is the nickname for these small plastic bins that each of them keeps near their desks. They get emptied out every night after the devs go home so they can be filled back up with any community ideas that can't be monetized.
---
Most people call them "trash cans".
---
I would literally use it all the time if the only down side was having no Armour.
---
Nothing more satisfying than sneaking around in stealth mode killing.
---
Some of these comments I‚Äôve read in only minutes- ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt effect me I don‚Äôt care‚Äù ooof fallout real word parallels. What about legitimate small traders ? Small businesses being taken down by mass reproduction of items üòû
---
The weapons the Communist Collectron finds are scrap at best, mine provided mostly Chinese Swords of little value. Its almost laughable to say its a Pay-To-Win shop item. Honestly you're far better off setting it to Junk if you need things like screws, or Scrap if after Ballistic Fibre.
---
There is very little else. Take the Season rewards for example - The sink is little better than the free water pump (or a trip to a river or pond), the ammo converter is good for getting rid of unsellable ammo but still can't compete with the Raiders ammo maker, the chicken coop provides ferts but so does the Brahmin pen (and who uses ferts in large quantity anyway?). All are welcome but none are the game changers/economy wreckers the naysayers predicted they would be.
---
Genius in the house
---
You might have a point there,come to think about it.
---
Good observation.
---
I was using a new character for the score challenge and some lvl 2 and lvl 11 kept bothering me so i hopped on my old character(lvl 168) and went up to them and i think they shit themselves and we fought and they easily lost and then whined over the mic that im being mean for hunting them down.
---
P2W doesnt mean pay-to-godmode.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
---
Clutching onto semantics is a hilarious way of displaying that your argument is built on sand, though. Are you gonna call me a big stupid poopoo-head next?
---
keep a small amount of common junk and a larger amount of uncommon junk
---
And use this to go shopping if you need a certain component

Or spring for one month of fallout 1st and fill that scrapbox as much as possible in that time. After you cancel you can still get stuff out.
---
Nice, I use an instigating one
---
This is an MORPG game.  It HAS to have some form of grind or no one would play it after all of the story content is done.  You don't have to play it.  You don't have to like it.  But the grind isn't going anywhere.
---
Me to (obviously ) :-)
---
I don't know where stealing comes into this but okay bud.
---
All legit weapons too? If so I dig it! I‚Äôm personally a bloodied melee- the queen doesn‚Äôt take off anymore with my team with me ü§ì
---
Just a sidenote. If you are going to get addictions for making berserkers work, why not just go junkies... I play berserkers with my alt and been doing so for a long time now. Best way i have found to play with it was with broken chinese stealth suit. Very op. Nobody sees you coming. Or going.
---
Yes, it can find weapons.
---
It finds BROKEN Chinese Swords.
---
That is IT.
---
So OP. Much P2W. Wow.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about changing my build honestly. I‚Äôve been a bloodied heavy for ages, and as soon as I find or pull a good Gun I‚Äôm considering switching to sneak rifleman/commando. 
---
I have like 75 level ups saved up and 15 perks packs so I‚Äôm all ready soon as the gun drops üòÅ
---
It sounds like everyone has had receptive experiences to the new players. 
---
In 4 instances, I dropped a bag of loot. Nothing game changing. Just some stims, radaway, rad-x and some purified water. Each time these new plays would look at it and walk away. 
---
I had to resort to leaving a lootbag in front of the vault door and hiding so they don't get intimidated and walk off. 
---
Still, glad to see some new dwellers. Too bad they're pretty darn stubborn.
---
I actually run both.
---
I never knew this,thanks.
---
They could disable every item in the game and have us all running around naked using our fists.
---
I've spent 110 hours looking for that red aslyum uniform and if things keep going like they are i will probably be able to get one for cheap
---
[my feels](https://imgur.com/LNkK3xV)
---
I agree but sometimes it feels like a chore more than fun. Still i respect your opinion
---
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs currently 1,500 to max out 6. Still ludicrous considering their are apparently 27 planned
---
Doing all the quests and the initial survival mechanics is really fun, the end game they are trying to introduce wont be a problem for oyu till you played like 200 hours at least, id go ahead and at least play those 200 hours.
---
What game was it ?
---
That doc will save me hours of searching reddit everytime I forget where to find a certain component. Thank you!
---
Really anything can be good imo. A nice variety can be quite good reducing damage from most enemies by 15pct.
---
As far as secondary I love ap refresh. 
---
3rds are versatile too. Weapon, ammo,  chem reduction.  Sentinel or Cavalier are good too.
---
Whitespring...half the challenge done in 2 bullets.
---
These posts are really informative for us all.
---
Or if you're Carnivore, Tasty squirrel stew! 20% bonus right there.
---
Do you have some mod to quickly swap sets ? I find it very tedious swapping all the time.
---
Genius nope, Pyromaniac hell yes!
---
There are still players with duped Nyla quantum‚Äôs which heal and instantly give ap, stuff is game breaking in survival
---
The blow up cars during the Halloween event was crashing servers.
---
Yup. Or at least I assume, I used a trading forum for the BE Handmade (traded a personally gotten BFFR Handmade for it) and some armor. A legit trading forum.
---
I'm working on a Bloodied Melee right now.
---
1. Change the color of CAMP icons if you have already visited them. Make them blue or something.
---
2. Allow us to manually type prices and quantities when loading our vendors.
---
3. Allow us to fast travel into interiors for certain locations.
---
4. Create a "Found Items" tab on the CAMP menu, that will allow us to place junk items found in the world in our CAMPS (I would love a Carlyle Typewriter and Jumbo Mr. Fuzzy in my CAMP).
---
5. Differentiate legendaries, apparel and armor as well as Bobbleheads, Magazines, etc when looking at a players inventory on the map.
---
6. Allow us to display our Character's name as opposed to our Username.
---
7. Allow legendary modules to be found on enemies or earned as rewards.
---
"We'll look into it"
---
Haha :-)
---
Like your style all the same.
---
This and  Sun-Kissed is literally why I stopped joining teams.
---
Ooo I was talking about the vultures who wait for the scraps at the train stations as well. They are stealing and a part of all this too :)
---
I understand where you are coming from.  I'm one of those weird people were if you give me a cool IP and a cool world I'll grind my ass off if I like the rewards enough.  So we are looking at this differently for sure.  
---
Some things do feel like chores, sure, but I've never played an MORPG game where I didnt have to do somethings that felt like chores, most of the time daily.  I guess this game is much easier to grind stuff out in that in other MORPG games like WoW or ESO so it doesn't seem near that bad for me.  It's almost a causal grind for lack of a better word.  It might do you some good to take a break for a bit and come back with the next update since you did seem to enjoy it for a bit at least.
---
Someone give this man some gold, I‚Äôm poor so I only have one updoot to give.
---
the real way to get back at dupers is to camp out at vendors to steal their shit when they switch servers
---
OMG!  I would have something to spend the 400 notes I have on.  Then I would also have a reason to start doing events again.
---
Brilliant!
---
People smacking their lips munching on Doritos down the mic need a ban.

Why not 54 after that!

I remember reading that a lot of them had just come out of college and were just getting their feet wet in the industry. Then they got tasked to make ‚Äò76, a game they were woefully underprepared to make, and it caused many of those graduates to have a very bumpy start to their careers.
---
Interviewer: You want the job? What did you work on?
---
Dev: Fallout 76.
---
Interviewer: Yeahhhh...we‚Äôll give you a call.
---
Narrator: They didn‚Äôt call.
---
Yeet?
---
Sounds like a plan. ...underwear is the meta
---
real money transactions?

The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different cosmetics. /s
---
Kill an enemy by exploding a vehicle
---
I sees a car I explodes it.
---
if it weren't for work-from-home from COVID, I'd have severely reduced play time, and I know what that's like. I grinded out my gear over two months, trading and paying out the ass (in game currency) for some of it (got a lot myself). So I get it when people want to get a viable build but don't have the time and resources to suffer the grind for it.
---
you are right. I am personally gonna go to their houses and smash their ps4s.

Pro tip: blueprint stairs or small structures in adventure so you aren't caught with your pants down trying to build
---
NEVER seems to be any punishment?ü§î
---
Honestly, I'm quite disappointed. Judging by the rampant hysteria yesterday morning I was expecting stacked bag drops at Whitespring, discount legacies in people's vendors, and a total crash of the games economy, but... Nothing has really changed. The same hoarders are still trading amongst each other, the average player still can't get a good deal on upper tier gear, and in general people seem pretty hostile. It's just another day on Fallout 76. 
---
Meh, I picked up a forest camo jumpsuit for 7500 so I can't complain too much. I just expected... More.
---
I haven‚Äôt spent a dime on this game (besides the $60 launch price). And you really don‚Äôt need to either if you have the spare time to grind out daily/ weekly challenges.
---
The things that you can buy that effect gameplay (coolers, scrap-bots, scrap/ repair kits) either don‚Äôt give that much of an advantage or have alternatives that can be earned in game (improved repair kits, or the most recent ammo converter).
---
Pre wastelanders so some info may be wrong now
---
Who the fuck are you talking to? Because bethesda does not run this subreddit and the community managers do not spend all day looking at every whiny post on "New". If you want something done go to the forums and post there
---
Also lose the aggressive attitude "Are you gonna do something or should I just start cheating" isn't going to get anybody to take you seriously.
---
I like your style
---
true. after the story content is done it becomes a battle of wills; us saying, "well maybe I can quit the game til more story comes along.." and Beth saying, " No! here's something to do to keep you occupied and spending money!"
---
Never been a punishment? How long you play f76 already?
---
It seems there are some bans going out.  But since people are still duping they need to do some sort of fix or do SOMETHING to stop the hemorrhaging.   It's so insulting that you can look at the dev tracker and see community managers responding to such minor issues while this is going on and remaining completely silent on it.  If you are doing something LET US KNOW ABOUT IT.
---
If you're familiar with the new dupe process, it seems very hard to catch. Unless they get carried away with it or don't trade/sell the items immediately.
---
Well rested, cranberry relish, inspirational lvl 3, 3 nukes on Whitesprings a day, plus I was laid off for 2 months due to the whole COVID-19 issue.
---
They claim to take dupers items and dump them in a river, but we all know they keep the items for themselves.
---
Because building upon said potential means spending more money into its developement than they are now.
---
They want to earn money not spend it. And there we are as a result; The current state of gaming industry where money grabs and broken games are common place nowadays.
---
okay, and how do you propose these people are identified?
---
Ahh the ol' Power Armor glitch
---
just picked up Underrail.  if u liked fo1,2, you'll like it
---
The majority of the players are exceptionally nice. So much so that Bethesda has reported on it, wondering why players aren't killing each other more. 
---
Sometimes ill take a break from doing events to check up on the low level players in the server. Maybe leave some ammo, water or medicine at their camp.
---
The fasnacht collectron makes my ears bleed, and yet he still sits right there in my camp....
---
Oh and stash used to be 400 so... no.
---
lol collectrons are about the 1 liners.. not whatever garbage that they manage to scrape up..
---
The coolers really are useless imo. I have all four of them, and, at least to me, they‚Äôre just camp decorations.
---
why does this happen?
---
Most of what I do are events and most of the times there aren't any active.
---
Some areas are lush; they just weren't hit by the force of nuclear blasts. They still received quite a lot of radiation, as evidenced by all the radiation in the streams and ponds. Chernobyl has shown us that irradiated locations can still be filled with healthy plant life.
---
Would be nice, I play PC so I'm not sure, but can't you get a comms ban on console for certain things?
---
This is a very blunt way of putting it but it's probably not too far off from the truth.  I don't blame them.  It's impossible for them to pump out story content at the rate the players want to consume it at.  After a week I had the wastelanders main quest done on all 5 characters and it probably took them months if not years to make.
---
Saw some dumbass arguing against the atom shop as pay to win by stating that "winning is dressing better and having a better more immersive camp than the others therefore in that regard it is pay to win" and he was actually serious
---
TIL
---
the experience you describe says more about you than it does about the game...
---
Real Money Trading yeah, which is also against the ToS and imo worse than the actual duping.
---
No idea, but it's been around and seems to keep coming back every few patches.
---
I say they make it a real thing. Call it the "Wendigo Mutation" and have it acquired from using the Cannibal Perk too much.
---
Well they need to put somebody on the front-facing side to take it then if the ‚ÄúCommunity Managers‚Äù a.k.a. PR Damage-Control Team cannot be of any service to us.
---
Having 370 levels in the game i  simply swap out my hybrid  build  a bit when i need to.
---
I also am bloodied.
---
I would like to change,but there is nothing that gets those high damage numbers like Bloodied does.
---
Junkies seems a whole lot of grief to get remotely near bloodied.
---
So i run with my bloodied build until i do SBQ event.
---
Then i swap out to Heavy Gunner 1,2,3, Commando 1,2,3, and use an explosive 50 Cal automatic Zealots 30% damaged to Scorched,And pop a psychotats  and it gets the job done.I dont bother wasting explosive Bobbleheads anymore.In fact most high tier enemies are explosive resistant anyway.

Can you imagine a player hub like folks have been asking for? Maybe players can have a "plot" in the town for a house/shop, take it a step further and be able to make "quests" for other players. Fetch quests would be simple enough, they certainly are for Ward. Or just assigning a location you want cleared out. 
---
As far as being able to side with them for the main quests, could have just been either hirable, nameless mercenaries, or maybe you'd have to bring friends and each one of you would have had a role to fulfill in the assault on the vault. Someone has to take down security, hack the terminals, break open doors, etc. Could have been an interesting way to go about it.
---
We did post on the forums.  There's a giant thread there with almost 2k views and hundreds of replies and nothing has been done.
---
I think its both. I started an alt but I'm running around in fo1st gear so people don't mistake me for a new player.

I agree. Just confirming the abbreviation

To add a little more confusion, she can log in on my computer which was running it successfully, but I can‚Äôt log in on her computer.

Anyone can indeed make thousand of rounds, but tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands in minutes? That's what gets flagged.
---
Because I've already gone down the junkie's path as a commando and a heavy. The berserker's toons have been my 6th and 7th builds (commando and melee) and I wound up liking the 2 addiction path better than broken armor üôÇ

gee idk, maybe find the guys account whos bundling 10x BE Gatling plasmas on gameflip.
---
Had 3 windmills at my old camp and all the power i could ask for.
---
now I've gone completely powerless save for a small generator for my ammo machine. been using candles and lanterns and lamps.
---
I come across it when I play as well. I've noticed if I walk away from where I'm at it will let me fast travel. I think one of the reasons it happens is when an enemy is nearby (I notice it a lot when I do Path to Enlightenment.) so walking away gets you away from them.
---
Let me do the math. I'm level 250 after 500 hours played so I'll be level 1200 after....
---
In all seriousness though, this would be much better. I'll take my one maxed out perk and get the others in a couple of years, lol.
---
If you chain it right, the truckstop is even more epic than the white string.

Definitely this, take your time and enjoy the sights.

it's unfortunate true. but there will be "game breaking" player caused issues in every mode no matter what we dream up. For every fix, there's someone who wants to break it. That's life.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll let the team know‚Äù
---
Bethesda dosent care
---
As i said, this is my experience and how i felt the game. Everybody is having their own experience.
---
I am new to fallout and have an potentially idiot question: why do i have to strip the armor pieces off of a power suit prior to getting into it?
---
I feel like they might have changed Guided Meditation a bit. Before the patch, I never bothered to kill anything at the Interior Hub. I soloed the event as often as I saw it start up, and all that I would do would be to ignite the fire, then run down to the Bridge Hub and defend it. The ghouls never got past the bridge and none of the other hubs got damaged. I'd just sit on that column right next to the hub and snipe the ghouls that were spawning and running down to attack it. Not sure if it's having additional players, but the spawns for the ghouls appear to have changed slightly, where now I can still do the event alone, but the ghouls come to the Bridge Hub from two different directions, and occasionally the Side Hub gets attacked.
---
You're spot on about Tea Time and the ghouls inside Red Rocket. I use a jetpack and I like to get on top of the broken playground tower. I think it's a far better vantage point because you can get the mobs that are hitting the main pipe there better than from the roof of the Teapot.
---
Try... harder!
---
Zero ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù items in the Atom shop.

The only ‚Äúpay for advantage‚Äù item I can think of is a FO1 membership. Everything else is cosmetic, or replicates something you can get in game.

Hell - even the MTX scrap and repair kits are crap. The repair kits that drop from the SBQ are significantly better, and easier to get. And has anyone ever seriously used a scrap kit? Ever? I have never once needed one in all of my time playing.

ahahahah

Use batteries included perk and you‚Äôre good to go.

That's not how this works. They've literally said outright that reddit is just as good of a place as any to post feedback. Idk why people keep posting this shit.

Three reasons( for me)
---
You only lose 1 str and 1 agility point with these two addictions as the other 2 negatives are actually positives.  Compared to 10 negatives with Junkies.
---
The high health/dr makes Junkies boring to me.
---
Berserker weapons are so much easier/ cheaper to find.

Hide all that useless weightless armour under your chameleon mutation...i will be a God!

Seems the way to go. I'm also semi hybrid, in the fact bloodied conveys a lot of perks naturally alongside unyielding. I run a bloodied explosive lever action mostly and just use heavy guns for tanky things or big groups and it works really well, especially for ammo purposes, but I don't *really* get those big one shot numbers. I can hit like 1200-1300 with an unarmoured headshot on some stuff but I feel I really wanna respec into it better, and honestly just change things up slightly as I've been bloodied for about 100 levels now. 
---
I also agree that Junkies maybe isn't the way and bloodied is just too good at everything to abandon fully I think, as evinced by the fact I can get good results using a rifle I am in no way spec'd for.
---
absolutely. like you said before, the grind has to happen, Bethesda has a business to run. you either find enjoyment in it...or not.
---
You know this isn‚Äôt based on facts right. This isn‚Äôt what the world would look like after the planet gets completely nuked. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming most of the fauna and animal life has adapted/mutated to withstand the radiation. Hence the radstags and radroaches.
---
I love the concept of shovels as a weapon. I'd love to get a *"pretty good"* legendary shovel.
---
&gt;for newbies
---
And how are new players going to have end-game content like marsupial, besides the small chance of getting it randomly from taking rads, in which case the smart thing to do would be to take a rad-away because they won‚Äôt have Starched Genes?
---
I‚Äôm tired of fo76 so I Will not play it for a while, so there‚Äôs No reason to pay for it if I won‚Äôt play
---
I'm on PS4 so no mods. I do label all of my armor so it appears at the top and in an order I can work with. It can be a pain to get used to, but eventually becomes a habit. It's always interesting going back to another build as it feels like I have nothing to do, just run and shoot üòÇ
---
good luck even playing it on the windows store version
---
The kill 9 creatures was the first I just had no interest in doing, 3 creatures was enough of a pain, based on how long it took me to get those 3 it would have taken the best part of 2 hours to kill 9, just not gonna happen. I am fairly happy in NW in general but trapsing about hunting mobs isnt actually any fun in this mode.
---
Would destroy the economy with all the hacking on PC. I get that the duping and glitches have already affected the XBOX community.
---
Lmao üòÖ
---
The only NPC that really sacrifices anything for you is Motherlode (God rest her soul).     
---
Give me a quest to rebuild her with Penelope, and I'm going to program her to process Raiders as ore.
---
Reduce the weight of the plans from 0.25 to 0.05 - then you wouldn't even have to increase the stash box limits. 
---
Next to ammo, plans are one of the most traded and hoarded commodity in the game, this tiny change would make a huge difference in the stash limit.
---
So, ya gotta do what ya gotta do to earn score, just because you dint like it means you‚Äôre gonna just quit?
---
It also steals time from the players with the special way it likes to bug out. When i quest with friends usually we all have to restart a few times to reload quests that didnt complete
---
I run a bloodied heavy weapon build generally, however I thought I would play around with a couple of different armour and weapon types. So I currently carry Zealot's armour and a Zealot's prime gauss Minigun for SBQ and Troubleshooters armour for silos. Both full health of course which frees up perk slots when I swap out the Serendipity, Nerd Rage, Dodgy and Radicool for more specific perks. I generally swap for Ricochet, Action Boy (for Plasma Caster on VATS), Demolition Expert (gauss weapons deal explosive dmg). Makes life interesting experimenting.
---
I really wish bethesda prioritizes community feedback as much as bungie does. Granted, destiny 2  has a lot of problems and many have been solved over the years because they have some of the best. Community managers that when they said "we will pass this on to the team" it actually caused change like fixing the shader system, tweaking progression or even sacrificing monetization by removing dlc themed items and armor from their in game store and making them obtainable through gameplay to even willingly axing their season pass after 4 seasons despite it making a lot of money for the studio. Bethesda only takes action when there are bugs that threaten monetization or gives players unfair advantage. Bethesda has shown time and time again that aslong as we keep buying the products they peddle they have no obligation to care anymore because we already gave them our money. All that I want is Bethesda's community managers to give us proof that our feedback matters and not giving us what seems like cold robotic responses from a corporation that has seemingly lost touch with the consumer
---
Thanks for the help, I think I just need to get used to resource management like you said. I'm not stashing any Aid items, and I've stopped hoarding weapons, so I've got a bit of space free now.
---
I don't plan on paying for Fallout 1st yet but if I really get into the game later on then I will definitely consider it since the scrap box does sound useful.
---
We serve Frosties here sir
---
I wonder how many of them think its loot from someone that's died and that's why they ignore it? When i started with wastelanders it took me a little time to figure out death only drops junk. I thought anything not equipped could go so i went out of my way not to die.
---
And the game turns into Inventory Management Simulator around level 40
---
LMAO are you watching me though my window?
---
Could still use some. Send me an invite when you get on. TheCrimsonDon
---
I love Billy in the streets!
---
I'm tired of grinding to grind the reputation for the factions for 1 maybe two daily quests per is getting old especially when its like 20k rep to get from neighbourly to allied.  The score system is interesting but shit.  It should be on a per person basis, like if the account has never ever touched nuclear winter, don't include those dailies to that person.  Stop requiring a lvl up 1-3 times for daily/weekly for people over lvl 50, just getting the level up daily at 77 is a damn chore. I love the concept of this game but it's been one miserable disappointment after another bugs out the ass and the company keeps beating the dead horse that is fallout 76 without ever fixing the problems.  Polish a turd it's still a turd comes to mind
---
Yeah. They dont play the game. At this point they're just trying to milk the remaining players. Sad really.
---
Some times i think at how good 76 could have been if it was a "real 
---
 standard MMO" with a proper team behind it.
---
Like you know ESO, ff14, wow and the like, with classes races etc. 
---
Maybe then we wouldn't be in this broken mess of an in between genre where some times apparent cluelessness of the game design ruins the experience if it's not a bug doing it.
---
Everyone that I have played with share your sentiments. I do, as well. 
---
The missions and storyline in the game are great, exploration is top notch, the landscape is beautiful and wild.
---
 Running through Appalachia as a sub 50 character is so interesting and full of discovery. It's a great experience. Even post 50, wastelanders has a good storyline to follow and allies have some interesting, albeit fetch questy moments. 
---
After all these missions are said and done (not counting dailies or events) the game sorta comes to a halt. I love the game but I'll be the first to admit that the Endgame is grueling and terrible. 
---
It's the same chore over and over:
---
-do your faction dailies
---
-scrip your trash legendaries for more trash legendaries 
---
-turn in your overabundance of treasury notes
---
-nuke fissure prime
---
- do events for more notes
---
-and now, make sure you do your daily challenges for the legendary run. 
---
It's a literal to-do list that grinds the game to a halt. Grinding isn't bad if you're working toward something you especially want, but when the grind takes days to see some progress, it's almost not worth it.
---
dump your plans. barely any of them are worth caps. Unless you happen to have some plans that are worth a lot. Like. LOTS of plans. And then one has to wonder where you got many plans from.
---
Oh man, back in the day those manuals were soooo big.
---
The Devs simply need to set up software flags for suspicious events. For example if a player adds 50k of Ultracite rounds in a day, or has multiple identical 3* Legendary items. Everything goes through the servers so everything can be scanned.
---
This was tedious, I got into the top 10 a few times without seeing a single creature.
---
If you didn‚Äôt read this post in the voice of Billy Mays you can‚Äôt sit with us üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
YEAAAAH. LIIIIVE.
---
Well selling in game items for real money is breaking the tos on its own and should be ban-able. That said, what are they supposed to do? Have a team specifically dedicated to scrolling through the transactions one by one? Even then, do people put their gamertag/username directly on that site? If not, they have to take it a step further and initiate the transaction to get their info.
---
Let's say they did do that. It isn't going to stop everyone else duping and trading rare items for in game items. The great majority of offenders are not selling items for cash.
---
i contracted Egghead at level 6 on my new character and have been using Nuka Grape to keep the Rads away. I want that extra XP from int
---
I usually do the gift emote, to which they still walk past me. Bethesda needs to add a 'cry' or a 'sad' emote.
---
Produce shit ton of purified water and sell it.
---
If anything the official forums get less attention than this sub lol.  People who only post on the official forums complain about this all the time.
---
Same man.  I had to look up how the hell to trigger a crit shot.  Also who the hell binds it to the damn space bar for jumping.
---
the workarounds help me too, but it gets frustrating when you‚Äòre in a big interior location like Arktos Pharma that spawns hostile robots on the constant. then i have to put myself through a new loading screen and also fight the robots outside/run away from the location. that can take like three minutes and in that time One Violent Night has ended. just an example, because that one got me to post about it today. again, thanks for the feedback! it‚Äòs very appreciated when you guys are in contact with us. sorry for the foul language in my OP :b
---
It's really funny. The forums think that nothing happens there and you have to post on Reddit to get traction. Reddit thinks that nothing happens here and you have to post on the forums to get traction.
---
I think that used to be the case at launch, but I believed they removed it due to the chance it could be used by griefers for death traps, etc.
---
Would definitely want to see it fixed and returned, though.
---
So the person who‚Äôs gonna be using an alt account. Not just an alt account, but somebody that bought the game again and used a different email to register it.
---
Are the levels for legendary perks just for a single character? Or all characters on an account. I have 3 characters from level 115-160ish to play different builds and styles so will only my highest level get me perk slots? Or combined levels on the account?
---
It's weird because only a few days ago they had a simple Kill 3 Creatures one. I don't know why they bumped it to 9 unless it's an error. From what I understand, they set up all these challenges ahead of time, so I doubt they decided to make it harder and probably just set it wrong, hopefully.
---
Reality: nothing happens anywhere
---
Yes people act as if it's fucking brain surgery but it's not lol.
---
Spawns have definitely changed.
---
That Side Hub has become more active,after being largely inactive.
---
I solo it all the time.
---
What i have found lately,is a medium speed melee weapon is more effective than a Gun.
---
Simply too many of the Ghouls,to be messing around loading,and reloading.
---
You kill 1,another 2 run past you.
---
What i have found is using my bloodied,bladed Knuckles,none of them run past me,i kill 1 the others dont know wtf to do,they sort of step back a bit rather than run past you when you shoot 1 with a Gun.
---
Also depending on which Hub is destroyed ,if iam on my own,i wait until there is 2 minute left before repairing the other 3.Makes sense when you think about.Whats the point running back and forth wasting Steel.
---
If 3 Hubs are destroyed the Ghouls will come to the  Hub you are defending.
---
Never let all 4 Hubs get destroyed obviously then it is event failed.
---
Just give yourself enough time to reach them all and repair them in the last 2 minutes.
---
Works for me.
---
I lost some, maybe you got mine
---
No one is noble. I think the wasteland has made made me a raider lmao! üíÉ
---
Regarding Penny Hornwright, can any of you guys point me to a lady that actually speaks like she does! I love it! lol
---
Ha! I was one of those people! I only recently learned because I was at an SBQ listening to someone else explain how to do it when someone asked...
---
Ever been to West Chester NY?
---
Any other MORPG game I have ever played in history, the developers have the tools to look at what is on anyone's account.  I've been on support with ESO for example and they were able to tell me exactly to tell me what they were seeing in my inventory when I lost an item.
---
If they do not have the tools to do this or set up flags to see if people adding multiple legacy weapons in a day then this is a failure on their part for not setting up a proper infrastructure to police their game.  Other AAA multiplayer games have been doing it better for YEARS before this game came out.
---
This would explain it, never had it happened before and I‚Äôve been playing for the last 6 weeks, until today when I decided to change to a bloodied build.
---
I don‚Äôt think the difficulty to get the perfect weapon is too unreasonable. All three effects being good is tough but 2/3 isn‚Äôt nearly as bad. It would be a lot better if they implemented an actual trading system into the game; that would make it easier to get a good weapon while still ‚Äúearning‚Äù it.
---
Either way it takes out that person's inventory they were going to sell.
---
Does the stuff you bought in the atom shop on xbox appear on pc version?
---
Im level 168 and I love to help low levels but I will attack or leave if the player attacks me or is very rude. Im wearing full marine armour and mask with secret service arms and I use a tse handmade with the screaming eagle paint and it always scares low levels.
---
i dont got 1st and dont care much about the outfits, i barely know which are rare. so in fact, im a lvl 140ish guy, that wouldnt recognize you're wearing 1st stuff. and tbh i dont think, much of the game pass players looked something like this up.
---
Pretty sure the answer on that is no as well.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 120 something ... every time I see a lvl 20 or under I unload everything I don‚Äôt need and they run away .. I just dropped you 10-15 one star items a gun you can use ammo Stimpacks  and 30 plans or more come back !!
---
I am always blowing up cars
---
It feels wrong to lvl up another character when u can grind on your main right lmaoo
---
Bethesda takes. Bethesda gives.
---
Here's how I would rework the perk system.
---
First, introduce account wide skills, allowing you to put points into passive bonuses that all your characters benefit from. Think something like Borderlands' "Badass Ranks" but with a Fallout 3 type skill system. Like Fallout 3, things like picklock, hacker, sneak and crafting cards are located here and are no longer perk cards. If you have these perk cards already, your points are automatically refunded. 
---
Legendary Perk cards and their ranks are account wide, but requires the character to reach Level 50 to use. Does not require perk coins to switch out. 
---
Legendary Perks cost 25 perk points to unlock and level totaling 100 to fully max out one four star card, and you can scrap your unused basic cards for one perk point per rank.
---
Whenever i see a person with legacy weapons like that on an event i put on my stealth suit and go stand directly in front of him while he start firing. Stupid fun.
---
Damnit :(
---
No legendaries is bs. they tried that kinda andf nothing did damage anymore
---
Exactly! The endgame items can still be a grind if they raised the bullion cap because there's so many different things to buy. 
---
As it stands, the grind is too much. If bethesda eased off, it would leave people wanting more content and would eagerly wait the next update. It shouldn't take the time between and after updates to get stuff introduced 2 updates ago without jumping on every single day for an hour to 2 hours.
---
I‚Äôve moved on to other games as well. I love fallout and elder scrolls genre and I enjoyed this game for a good while but after I got two PA pieces for grinding gold bullion, I gave up. I want this game to be good and it‚Äôs not a bad game at its core but there is so much bull shit involved. The amount of grinding they‚Äôve put into this game to prop up a feeling of end game is ridiculous. I never got max faction rep just because I cannot stand to do more Radiant quests for pitiful rewards. Maybe I‚Äôm a quitter but I was doing the quests every day for like 2-3 weeks and it was so fucking boring. I don‚Äôt wanna hop on a game for an hour every day and be forced to stop grinding because of limits on how much progress I can make. Like just let me grind 10 hours a day a week or two so I can actually achieve something within a reasonable time and feel good about it. 
---
There‚Äôs just so many things wrong with the game that it‚Äôs not worth playing anymore because I know I can have more fun playing something else.
---
Marsupial is not end game content.
---
It is a mutation a Newbie should be buying as soon as they start the game.
---
It is pretty much essential in this post apocalyptic World.
---
Without starched Genes it is tricky to hang on to.
---
The nack is diluting all your Rad-X and Radaway early on until you dont have to.
---
Probably because most of the Fanboy/Hater posts are from people who seemingly have little or no software experience beyond loading up windows or pressing a console on button.
---
If you had purchased a month of 1st on console, it probably went under a subscription and auto renewed.
---
Feel free, it doesnt matter what other people think, just make sure you weigh the risks and repercussions (it‚Äôs like playing creative Minecraft or GM fo4)
---
I bet you say that they‚Äôre the toxic one too, don‚Äôt you?
---
For every 2k (post tax) you make in sales you'll recieve 15 Vendor bot tokens. Redeemable at vendor robots around Appalachia. You can obtain 60 bot tokens from sales per day and exchange a maximum 75 a day at vendor stations for a 15% increase in item sold on screen display time!
---
Really though its been asked for probably 1000 times but we just need a sales log accessable via terminal.
---
No way you are getting banned. There have been duped weapons in circulation since the beginning and very high amount of innocent people would get banned for that. This is either for previous duped items where it is easy to detect large amounts of junk/ammo/gifts etc. Or they found another way to detect the dupers for this current method with checking the vendor sales or something.
---
I seem to recall a couple months back with the presents dupe they just shut the servers off maybe a 5 minute warning. I think the idea is not to give the dupers a window to hurry their duping. They may be doing that...
---
YUP LMAO spot on.  I like you
---
Completely agree, check out how often film uses the same screaming copy pasted into a movie/tv show. The screaming in this one video game event is better than most I've ever heard, seriously, Bethesda should just sell this to big Hollywood studios.
---
While this idea has its points I don't agree with, it basically points out that BGS needs to experiment with a ton of different ideas and let us get our hands on them, and then see what actually works in game. Faceroll the dials on the control board and try some drastically different solutions, maybe one of them will yield a lightbulb moment on the right design to go with.
---
They usually have launch codes and stimpacks for me which I find worthwhile.
---
Funny enough, I think I have one blueprint but it's a bit pathetic but I definitely need to remake it.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of not being able to respawn by killing yourself with a legacy. But, I‚Äôve also never had the plasma, so I guess it‚Äôs just that.
---
i lure low lvl noobs to cars and then shoot the car until boom
---
Haha no worries I completely understand. It is a frustrating one to experience! They're very passionate about getting to the root causes of this one.
---
That's what I was originally thinking but since a whole freakin day went by yesterday without a peep and it's friday and we still haven't heard anything I'm losing hope man..
---
Lmao
---
I actually do that, but you still wind up with sellable ones that pile up over time. I found that putting the bulk of my plans at 25 caps moves them out quickly and I still make a bit of fast travel money, but a small weight reduction wouldn't hurt either.
---
Holy crap yeah, forgot about that perk it came with, thanks!
---
I do wonder how many people are left still working on Fallout 76, especially as Starfield is entering later stages of production where all the manpower is needed. Although it also looks like the majority of FO76 resources are allocated towards the large content updates (Wastelanders, then Fractured Steel a year later), but the team for the regular smaller patches seem to be lacking in size or experience, even compared to the first few months after launch, when patches with larger numbers of bug fixes were released more frequently than now.
---
Can you imagine half the server doing this challenge at the same time?
---
Not only would it sound wild in game I‚Äôd probably be playing at a slideshow pace due to fps drop üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt use it because I‚Äôm a bloodied build so one accident shot I die and can‚Äôt respawn
---
For the first time in, well.. ever, I have actually been turning missles and mini nukes in to the ammo machine instead of throwing them on the ground. Once I figured out that you can spam click through it fairly quickly and exit with Esc, it was a bit less of a pain.
---
Not even attempting stacks of anything until the changes go in though, said there is a page being removed and 10x and 100x options being added.
---
I walk the waste gathering all the junk I can see.
---
Well it sure works on my auto grenade launcher! Thought it works for explosive legendary effect aswell. Might be wrong tho i need to test it!
---
Im laughing and crying
---
I work in IT and have just finished a company wide project so ill assume its simlar to this. A request for change or a bug comes in and gets added to a large pile of all the others. The project lead(s) then go through and rank each items importance based on qol change and the effect it has the the rest of the program (game) as well as the amount of people shouting for it. In our case once a week the project lead gets together with senior managers (dev head and testing head) and works out what's in the next patch and based on development hours slots it all together for the next week. I.e. if one piece of work would take 4 hours thats one dev for half day. The dev manager then hands out that work. Theres more steps after that but thats what i know to be a dev timeline.
---
True! If they are going to shut the servers off, doing at the point the dailies roll over would be ideal so fewer people have them auto complete!
---
[Battlecry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ie_achnL44)
---
That‚Äôs kinda toxic if there not being annoying just leave them alone
---
That‚Äôs not true you can killed my self befor with 1
---
It's terrifying because we've all been there.....in that situation....with those things.
---
There are many benefits of 1st (I personally don't subscribe), depends on how much you want to invest into the game (both in terms of money and time).
---
with the exception of marine armor plans and BoS underarmour plans mine are 1-25c
---
and then every now and then i grab a load of them and just throw them at newbies.
---
This is actually a fun challenge, I love it!
---
Make a second account?
---
I've played since launch, and I've had about 4-5 crashes. Just lucky I guess.
---
The two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive you clever lil firebug!
---
They can tell you what you have in your account, real-time. Can they track every single motion and interaction you've ever had? Because if not then it's useless. They're flagging people for bans rn for excessive items, but it's only the people that are completely shout out about it, having absurd amounts of rare items like leader bobbleheads. You can bust someone with 10x exploding gatlings if they are selling them for cash, but you cant ban someone just for having them if you can't trace exactly where they came from if it's actually possible though. It's unlikely, but someone can absolutely acquire that many of a rare legendary either by chance, or by trading, collecting and grinding. Saw someone literally give away a B2525 fixer yesterday. Should the receiver be banned if they already had some that they purchased or traded for previously?
---
I agree the lack of having a system in place is a failure on their part, and even further, the ability to dupe is on them too. That said, it isn't as simple as "*just* ban them already," as OP put it. You can't just start banning players left and right without hard evidence. I get Bethesda screws up a lot, but issues Are seldom as simple as "just do" anything.
---
No, if that was the case 90% of players would be banned. Hell you could dupe yourself and not get caught for a while.
---
Shut up and pay
---
That was messed up.  Genuinely disturbing to even think about.
---
Hey, I feel you. Ghoul gets too close with a TSE flamer and you‚Äôre done with. But even then, legacies get kinda boring to use after a while. For really spongy stuff they‚Äôre nice, like the queen and sheepsquash.
---
I‚Äôve done it 4 times
---
There's no way they can keep it the way it is. There has to be something we don't know.
---
Good photo
---
On ebay?  yes.  In game?  no.
---
It‚Äôs not because of the Gatling. It‚Äôs a respawn bug that affects you no matter how you die
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you did
---
Is that the same tower where at the top, there is a bunch of baby stuff and a dead body with a 10mm in its hand?
---
Cause that one choked me up.
---
Nice. Time to spend my 25k caps
---
Lmfao, dude has 2k hours played and still didn‚Äôt have the guns he‚Äôs mad others can get now and wants to call others liers. I‚Äôm at 354 hrs played full unyielding ss, allied with both factions. No way he‚Äôs at 2k hours and this is even a concern.
---
Hold the phone. It takes 1500 LEVELS TO MAX A SINGLE LEGENDARY PERK CARD?!
---
It's a low chance thing, I've only encountered him once, and I've gone out if my way to nuke the other locations to try and spawn him more than a few times.
---
TBH it's a giant bullet sponge with disappointing rewards atm. I'm hoping the event has good drops at the least.
---
Get ride of sliders for quantities. 
---
Allow bulk crafting.
---
They don‚Äôt ban anyone unless it affects something that makes them money. For example, you can use an XP glitch to your hearts content but once you use a SCORE glitch you get banned
---
I have almost 200 pounds worth of plans i try to sell.
---
Yea being forced to complete NW missions for the Legendary Run actually burnt me out.  My need to complete things like the Legendary Run and having to do NW is what finally broke me.
---
I have over a 1000 hours played got me fucked I got it the day it came out in walmart calling me a liar like taking this shit to serious
---
Diners are often made out of decommissioned train cars, see  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner#/media/File:Summit\_diner\_1024x658.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner#/media/File:Summit_diner_1024x658.jpg) 
---
It's a good bundle - the checkered floor tiles are very useful too
---
Take a break occasionally.
---
as with life too much of anything good is bad.
---
I have OCD in real life.
---
Weird how it appears in my gaming habits.I collect all my improved repair Kits 300+ now.
---
I never use them unless i really have to.
---
Every weapon i have is Bloodied apart from my Queen Killer,and thats only because i have not been dropped a Bloodied 50 Cal .
---
I enjoy the grind most times.
---
That challenge takes into consideration the bugged limited time challenges that are available again, so unless you did the math and are absolutely sure that you lost those points, there's a chance that they were rewarded.
---
Did you unlock any Christmas, Halloween or Survivors limited time cosmetics since Tuesday?
---
No I'm not cool with playing with cheaters, if these duped items aren't deleted by the end of the Legendary Run, I'm done with 76 if they let the cheaters who clearly don't know how to play the game properly do whatever they want
---
Bro what lol, not even with eBay would you get banned
---
104 when I figured out power attacking with melee.   So I feel ya.
---
I'm not gonna say they don't have goodies in them, I'm just saying for how rare the enemies seem to be, I could see them maybe increasing the frequency a bit for my taste.
---
I hate the love I felt for the hatred that enjoyed NW and loved the loathing I became infatuated with bc of my constant pining for the sense of fury I experienced over the dailies.
---
relax chief
---
Nah i'm gonna keep doing that. If you use mass duped 3rd party software generated legacy weapons (99.99% of them are) you are fair game.
---
Okay awesome, thank you!
---
For real. I resell things that I buy at other camps and keep some of the stuff in my stash to save for myself if I needed it. 5mm is a big seller sometimes but I keep a few hundred rounds for my Gatling gun.  I‚Äôd really like to be able to offer more to players that clear out some ammo types but idk who they are because their name only shows for a half a second.
---
Yes üò¢
---
One is against the TOS one is not.  Whether or not you will get banned is a totally different question.  OP was asking if they COULD be banned.  RMT is against the TOS so it's possible to banned for.
---
Though in *that* perspective they should give them a call as they still somehow managed to make the game *work.* It's not nearly in any case you would expect a triple-A game to be but with what resources they had and got told to do they probably did the best they could so far.
---
You have to log in daily so they get eyeballs on the atom shop ads. That‚Äôs why the daily cap. To keep you playing every single day
---
A lot of people on this sub honestly are just bad at this game, can‚Äôt build properly don‚Äôt know what to do to get the gear they want and they blame the game for it. It‚Äôs so funny to watch them cry every day on here.
---
Can we like, pin this or something?
---
as long as it hasnt sunk under the map you can use a prosnap camera to find the corpse...
---
I guess but if there not bothering and not automatically killing the legendary enemy who cares
---
Facts I've had 4 builds and I'm switching to a stealth commando with a b2525 fixer
---
Fuck no. This idea is terrible. You should feel bad.
---
You might have gotten the score for that one. If when you loaded the game up, before completing anything, and it said 0/3 on that challenge, then completed a challenge, say the 3 lockpick one we had the other day, it might have completed due to you completing hidden challenges we have in NW right now, i.e. the winter and halloween challenges. they arent listed anywhere, but players are getting the rewards for the challenges when passing certain xp threseholds. They count towards that weekly.
---
Well if you see the trailer for that game you get where the devs are coming from with their expectation and main focus of a PvP-oriented Fallout
---
To organize keys?
---
What are you going to do with an increased area if you don't have the budget to fill it up?
---
I use a full set of Mutants Heavy Combat armor on my non bloodied character. It's just nice to have overall consitent DR. It's not amazing but it's good enough for my build. Just wish it would stack like Junkies :/
---
Yeah I try and do the same with lower level players. Especially when my stash and player inventory is filling up.  Sometimes they run away but I figure it‚Äôs because of the skull Halloween mask I wear.  Does not exactly seem friendly I guess.  I use the gift emote before I start dropping stuff.
---
Go to the Xbox website. Should be able to cancel it there.
---
While the Scrap Box is a huge benefit, it‚Äôs understandable and reasonable that many players choose not to become a FO1st member. 
---
Before Scrap Boxes were available, I used [this resource](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) to help prioritize what scrap to keep and how much to keep on hand.  The made a few adjustments, based on what I was regularly crafting, of course. I used [this farming guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) to quickly acquire the scrap I needed when needed. If I got above my preset limits (like more than 100 Oil), I‚Äôd sell the excess to vendor bots. 
---
I hope this helps your stash management!
---
Rdr2 style
---
Even better: a log of some kind that you can scroll back through in case you miss something.  However, this is dangerously close to having a chat log and Bethesda seem deathly scared of implementing text chat so I won't hold my breath.
---
There was a guy at ws station giving away b/25/25 fixers to everyone yesterday. Just saying don't over pay lol
---
'And end instantly'.
---
Usually I never even get a chance to see the legendary creature. It‚Äôs mowed down the instant it spawns.
---
Only in the PTS at the moment.
---
Great idea, much better then kill 9 animals in NW!
---
I've been selling those marine armor plans as quick as I get them for 420 caps, same with the BOS plans for 200 caps and they're gone fast. The 'housewares' plans I get from grabbing workshops I started putting those at 25 caps, but weapon plans I sell for some different prices depending on the weapon. 
---
A couple of weeks ago, not that they have weight, but I put another vendor in my camp and filled it with all of my treasure maps for 25 caps each. Someone came along and cleaned them out within 30 minutes. I thought it would be funny to put the Crane Treasure Hunting sign there, and have it sit in my camp a bit, but I scrapped it and that other vendor out after those maps got gone.
---
Right?! And not once, but twice, put 'Mag' instead of 'Meg'?? I literally didn't know who tf he was talking about at first. I thought there was some character named Mag that I somehow hadn't run across in my 125 levels yet.
---
You mean quitting my job and living in my mothers basement for 7 years to get all the legendary perks maxed out.
---
Point me to anyone who got banned for buying gear from someone. I as well as plenty of people I know have both been buying and selling for upwards of over a year and no bans. How would Bethesda know?
---
Nope, I was level 19 and hit level 21 by doing my dailies and the repeatable a few times throughout that day, the 4500 score I was supposed to get would have brought me up to at least level 23-24
---
I tried it before. Says I don‚Äôt pay for it but I got charged today
---
Great suggestions, 4.)would be a lot of fun.  
---
7.)  I have a bunch of mods and its difficult to figure out if I have an item I can use it on or if I already have it on an item.  My armor mods are a hot mess.  A lot of times I don't know what I should be looking for with my gear.
---
Basically to hide all of the keys from within you inventory. There's a bunch of threads on the topic. Basically the more unique items you have in your inventory, the slower it goes. So by end-game, you will have like a hundred keys, that you can't drop, can't store, and likely have some duplicates due to glitches (I think I have over 10 copies of one key or keycard). The keyring will exist within your pipboy (or somewhere like that), so you can still open to check if you have a certain key or what not, but don't need them all to load every time you open your inventory or stash.
---
it means they will put it in a "suggestion" box some where in the office and it never gets looked at unless there is nothing else to work on OR it directly effects Bethesda's profits like the atom shop.
---
Do some of the hordes spawn as legendary?
---
&gt;3rd party software generated
---
Bud, I hate to tell this to you, but those are hacked weapons. Legacies were legitimate drops. I‚Äôve been playing since the first day of beta on PC, all the way back in October of 2018. Those were actual things you could get back then. Before you say it, yes, I know those were heavily duped. But there‚Äôs still a giant, massive difference between legacy weapons and hacked weapons. And considering that PvP is so dead that assassins gear is more useless than nocturnal, I don‚Äôt see the problem with using legacy gear when the entire adventure mode is PvE. You can be upsetti all you want because you don‚Äôt have something, but that‚Äôs hardly an excuse to be a dick to other people just trying to have good fun.
---
I think the basic vending machine is automatically in Your camp plans?
---
I was wondering the same thing.  It almost seems like they put this challenge in the game thinking most players wouldn't complete it and be forced to buy atoms.  They made killing three a requirement and thought most people wouldn't bother.  When a surprising number of people completed the challenge, the upped the number in the hopes that people would just fail it.
---
Tl:dr Does the Queenmeat turn in refresh the purifier defense with Fishbones? 
---
(Note, just  a small raider rep quest)
---
I'm pretty sure you should automatically get the normal vending machines. If not keep playing. The atomic shop ones are only skins for the normal one
---
I still feel like I (as someone with a few hundread hours) should be able to get atleast one legendary perk card maxed out.
---
Ope, you're right - "Battered Clipboards" gives springs and apparently "Clipboards" give screws.  My bad.
---
In theory yes.
---
In practice Hell No! 
---
The Devs are far more likely to be interested in the big fish duper than Mr Random one time one item buyer (or they damn well should be!) so you can relax. Be aware but don't be stressed.
---
You don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never noticed that.
---
Path to enlightenment has ghouls? Did you mean guided meditation? While I was reading it I was imagining you having trouble killing them fireflies with your bloodied build lol.
---
If you hate all these fundamental design decisions so much that you feel driven to write a meanspirited post railing against people trying to do their jobs as best as they can, maybe the answer is that you just don't like this game and should play another one of the hundreds of games in related generes instead?
---
Crazy talk, I know.
---
For melee, my two favorites are a vampire switchblade and a ghoul slayers FSS switchblade.
---
At L38, I was using a vampire machete and a combat rifle  But at the time, the fixer wasn‚Äôt in game, and I hadnt run across a lever action.
---
The ticket response I got says they have no way to redistributing score. That‚Äôs bull they just want us to buy the atoms to make up lost spaces.
---
I sell my plans super cheap, regardless of what the suggested price is.
---

---
Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll kidnap todd if I get banned
---
I've been doing a random mix of + to Int armor now that leveling speed is important due to the season race. \~2% xp per point of intelligence.
---
I was playing when they updated it, building at my camp, then about 12 minutes after they updated the challenges I went to take a look and noticed that they had been ticked off sadly, I didnt do any of those as it would've increased my rank by 3 to 4 levels
---
We gave them money and they still didn't give a fuck what we think.
---
Few hundred hours at level 320. I screw around heaps so I could be a lot higher. But I have also completely respeced my character a total of 3 times so im yet to get all the perk cards maxed out.
---
I'm pretty sure they put out a little post/news release on the forums a couple months ago about people being banned for RMT.
---
Go figure.... smh. Though, maybe we can make up for the loss in score at the double xp week(end?) at the end of July!
---
I was thinking there was no way they‚Äôd let this go overnight, but I was clearly wrong. It might be Monday before they can put a stop to it, which would be bananas.
---
Until I find a good one handed melee I‚Äôll be using  Suppressor‚Äôs Grognak‚Äôs axe, 109 base dmg + 40% power attack. Just got a two shot gauss so I‚Äôm good in the sniper department
---
You need perks like nerd rage, Blocker, dodgy and serendipity which you get at much higher levels. Though the extra damage when you're getting you're ass kicked doesn't hurt.
---
Take the serum that was given to them for free by a higher level player. Use the mutation they got from getting irradiated. 
---
The mutations aren‚Äôt ‚Äòend-game‚Äô content, lol. You can have Starched Genes 2 by level *31*.
---
Not killing the legendary is hardly a legacy problem. Bloodied builds can do that a lot more easily, and while using less ammo.
---
I don't. Not even a little. In fact, I'm considering emailing Bethesda with the suggestion.
---
This is literally how it goes for any video game, it's obnoxious. "I play this game for 2 hours a week, I obviously deserve a say in how the veteran players play the game!"
---
No they are not. If you actually were here before the nerf to energy weapons you would know that the legacy weapons that were around on trades on that time period have nothing to do with the ones we are seeing now. There were very shitty rolled ones and mostly lower level ones around only. These perfect rolled ones appeared to the markets when the 3rd party softwares appeared that can spawn any item. EDIT: And i do have couple of them i have acquired from trades. I just choose not to use them on public servers.
---
F you are on PS4, I have the plans in my vendor.
---
I really need a decent reply to why the asinine limits exist.   
---
If they where a weekly thing, it would be FAR better, and the SCORE's ever increasing XP requirements, someone actually signed off on that?
---
Hmm, guess I'm doing my daily Adventure SCORE and then ranking up NW levels all weekend if this is true. Want to finish up the glitched Halloween/Xmas NW items while they still count.
---
On Xbox. 
---
Click start go up to your name where you can see your rep with raiders and settlers. Click A and then select something like make team public.
---
Most games like this do.
---
But, on the other hand, chores - or more specifically, predictable routines - are something a lot of people find comforting now.
---
My colorblind ass can't find anything out there, the camera trick is the best way around that. It would be nice if there were a built in easier way but you work with what you have.
---
And how long till you can actually max out the ammo legendary perk?
---
#2. Yes
---
#3. Please Yes
---
#4. But then they can't sell you these for Atoms....
---
(Edit-numbers didn't show properly)
---
Very true. WR shovels are the things you just never trade. 10 legacies and a red asylum dress? Naw dawg, can't give me enough for mine.
---
Oh, so the game is forcing you to get to the end of an alternate advancement that rewards cosmetic items and junk?
---
50k ultracite in a day is doable from my understanding. Especially if you are trading. Same thing with multiple identical 3* items. Unless they have a log of every single interaction that every single player does, it is impossible for them to say with certainty that items were duplicated, and if they can't definitively prove that items are duplicated, they shouldn't be banning people. Paying customers don't deserve to be banned for getting lucky or collecting a specific weapon. I saw someone literally give away a B2525 fixer yesterday. Let's say the receiver already had 2 - random roll and another that they bought. They're flagged as suspicious under this system now? They run across another player who trades them another (bc these things are everywhere now). Should they be banned now?
---
I know these circumstances are less likely, but theyre absolutely possible, and they just can't blindly ban people or even "suspicious" players without having the receipts to back it up. We're paying customers and while cheaters deserve to be banned, it should never be at the expense of legitimate players. It's not *simply* "just ban them already" like OP puts it.
---
Yes, That would be helpful!  I have duplicate keys/cards that I just don't know what they are for or where to use them.  Thanks for the explanation.
---
I‚Äôve never seen anyone past the 400s, you would have to invest an incalculable amount of time to reach that high a level
---
You can do some groundwork early on I guess with general SPECIAL decisions and some cards, but a lot of stuff doesn't unlock for a while that makes it truly viable. 
---
However the more you know/learn and work on early, the less you have to do later. I saw a level 20-odd the other day bloodied but I expect that was not a first toon. Is it your first character? It'll definitely be a challenge early on for sure if you're new.
---
I wasn‚Äôt as badly effected as some. 750 was my total lose and I was able to make that up fairly easily. I‚Äôll keep raising the issue though, since they seem to want us to just shut up and except the bugs they won‚Äôt fix or help with. It‚Äôs affecting to many people for them to take this ‚Äòi don‚Äôt care‚Äô stance.
---
I've been able to get the Fishbones/Defend Water Purifier quest whether I turn in anything or not. I usually use the mirelurk meat from that quest to fulfill the order for Blackeye.
---
I have done maybe 200 matches of NW.
---
Had it crash once, and that was due to my internet.
---
Get better internet or a better computer.
---
It highest character. So you could get a character to 300 and have 6 slots on all accounts.
---
You couldnt however get 3 characters to 75 and get 6 slots.
---
The levels dont add together either - I have a lv200+ and a level 150~ but I only count as lv200
---
We need a junkjet in this game, one that allows us to load any items we are carrying and shoot them at our opponents face. be a better legendary sink than the scrip
---
You forgot the obligatory DOUBLE U DOUBLE U DOUBLE U BUYCHEEPSTUFFSFRUMFARM3RSONLINE DOT COMZ
---
Check in the build menu under Vendors, you should have them there.
---
Thank you, and about the level crawling, it just seems to me that a lot of folks on the reddit have 100+ characters thats all.
---
I turn in queen meat daily and have only ever protected purifiers the first time I went there. Didn‚Äôt think you could do that quest more than once. I‚Äôll try talking to him next time I‚Äôm on.
---
What weapon perks did you pick? I don‚Äôt now if I should go sneak commando or heavy...
---
This is an easy fix ,
---
ADD TEXT CHAT BETHESDA!!!
---
Those kind of message would appear on text chat box instead of pop up and we‚Äôll be able to scrolls up to check the history
---
It just takes a run through conversation with Fishbones to access the dialogue to trigger the quest
---
I got the FDC one on my grind, I actually like it better as the 5th piece. still carry 150+ guns and run.
---
Ok. So I do agree that 1500 for all is still a high bar to get. But I do think it would be better than what we have now. Im over level 300 and ive spent a lot of time playing. That would allow me to get some of them leveled up if they changed it.
---
I leveled an alt that went bloodied almost right away... I only had one low level Unyielding piece in terms of gear. I picked up adrenal reaction randomly at around level 12 and just never used a single radaway until I unlocked Starched Genes. I mean, it was okay but both Bloodied and Junkies builds aren't all that useful until you're finished your SPECIAL build.
---
If you do, you should title your email "Dear Bethesda, this is the worst idea I've ever come up so I'm sending this to you as precaution of what you should never do. Because it's so bad."
---
Tea Time's status as a "Very Easy" event is kind of misleading.
---
On one hand, it's sluggish and the enemies that show up are generally low-level.
---
But on the other, a low-level player is going to have a difficult time looking after all the pipes because they are so spread out.
---
And unlike most of the other defense quests, like Uranium Fever or Guided Meditation, *there's no way to repair the pipes.*
---
Yes, its random, but they do fairly often.
---
 I would estimate that around every 5-7 respawns of the minions has a legendary. Thats kind of an average guess though, I've had them spawn back to back, and also gone 20 min without seeing a single one, so its pretty random. 
---
Some hordes we never spawn legendaries like scortched. Wolves, liberators, and rad rats also seem to have extremely low chance of any showing up.
---
The key is to have a horde even of a creature you don't mind farming for normal drops, like yoa guai, who drop around 6 springs each, or crickets who drop acid.
---
8-10 minutes? What platform? PC is about 1:30 of waiting no matter the size or time of day.
---
‚Äûwhile wearing a Beerhat and being intoxicated with nuka wild‚Äú
---
Not that stuff again pls...
---
With what we‚Äôre seeing now? You mean the body of a broadsider with the barrel of a minigun with a recon scope that shoots orbital strike missiles? Or the cryolators with minigun barrels and beam splitters that are explosive? Or miniguns that fire MIRVs? Yeah, **those** are hacked in. Explosive energy weapons existed long before that. 
---
Again, just because you don‚Äôt have it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs cheating. I have a legacy wedding ring that gives me +1 strength and -50% fall damage. What should happen to me? Be constantly annoyed by you because I have something that affects you in no way possible at all?
---
Oof. I'm looking for stuff, that implements a new feature into the game, that isn't outplayed by another thing in game, kinda like being able to go back to your base to find free scrap in your base without the junk extractor, by buying the collectron. I'd agree on that anything like a wallpaper or fence or whatever, is in no way pay for advantage, and is just for personal taste. 
---
But 'tis not a discussion, as it is a question, so I won't hate on anyone for their opinion, only asking.
---
Plans are automatically provided at the start and you won't find them during play. The Atom Shop vendors are purely skins.
---
I agree, we are different , it would be a dull world if we were all the same :)
---
I'd like to keep the perspective out there that for a large amount of the "last few months" we have been in the midst of a global pandemic. The people working on this game have been working from home for the vast majority of it, and if Bethesda is anything like any other development company at the peak of all of this, some of the team were most definitely temporarily laid off and there was an even smaller group of people than usual working remotely on it. I'm not sure how much experience you have with game development, but communication when you arent with your team in person, on a large scale project like this, can be and is incredibly challenging. And given the state of the US at the moment I wouldn't be surprised if they were still working with a fraction of the team and working from home. I am not complaining about anything during this pandemic, because every line of work is being hit continuously, and none of us really know the challenges anyone is facing when we aren't in their line of work.
---
So many under-utilized factions in this game.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm laying early groundwork. Already have serendipity x3. Early perks really, really suck.
---
Vats works with certain weapons,  the railway rifle being one of them.   But the meta weapons are:  bloody limb damage Tesla, bffr tesla, jffr tesla, be and je lasers... and of course be and je gatling plasmas.
---
Armors would be assassin sneak or sentinel/ cavalier preferably powered in the flavor of heavy leather, combat or Secret service if you're lucky.   I guess x01 or t65 maybe for a power armor heavy build
---
How exactly do you move the game to another drive? I don‚Äôt see that option listed and I see that I can change the default install directory for all game pass games. Would I just have to copy the folder over and that‚Äôs it?
---
Happened to me a few times recently. It's amazing, don't even need to spend caps fast travelling.
---
Adrenaline perk don't work at the moment.
---
Project managers have people to answer to who don't want real answers they want answers that make their pockets happy.
---
Maybe.. kill enemies with a blown up car? That would be dope af
---
yeah.
---
They've done a right terrible job of providing engaging end-game content. Like, REALLY terrible. My favorite part of Bethesda games is exploring. Well, 300 hours in, I'm completely done exploring. There's literally nothing left to do, outside of the SAME MF-ING rep quests EVERY SINGLE DAY
---
people don't even play like this on a mass scale - and if they do, they're scrubs, and if you get killed by them, you're just as bad.
---
Yeah.. they're trying to hush it up in my eyes.. I wont stop bugging them though until they do indeed do something about it!
---
My camp is at Pleasant Valley Station and even though it only has a few cars, I will be working on something and suddenly it sounds like I am under attack. I run outside looking to find what is going on only to realize it is just somebody blowing up the cars.
---
I've literally never seen this happen in over a decade of playing fallout games until fo76
---
That is true
---
Its too bad there isn't a rarity quality for plans. Something simple like what percentage of active players have learned this plan. I'm not sure how difficult this would be to create, but even if it updated biweekly or monthly, it would be useful. It would tell you right away if plans are worth selling or if you are better just scrapping them.
---
I have two junkies, one lvl 201 heavy and a 150 ish commando. I really enjoy both, but want something different.
---
Shooting insects from a distance my pet hate where are you mofo
---
Yeah, people have said its because adrenaline not working, but i don't use it, and have noticed the same thing. 
---
I was one shoting most enemies, but after patch 20 those same enemies will now take 2 shots. Ive turned to drugs because of this.....
---
'We appreciate your patience'
---
Mark components for search in the components view of the junk menu in the pipboy. It will mark any piece of junk with a magnifying glass that has the component you're searching for. So mark springs, and then you'll see that clipboards are marked.
---
NW crashes are especially painful because it takes so long to load back into a match.
---
I've tried and tried and only ever managed to get the defence quest twice. It's annoying but not as much as the broken Blackeye dialogue that was broken, fixed and then rebroken and still takes an age to progress for a very paltry rep reward.
---
Next DLC there will be new events called ‚Äò***The Route to Introspection***‚Äô where you have to catch floating illuminated ghouls and put them in a cage, and ‚Äò***Supervised Search for Wisdom***‚Äô where you have to keep rad ants from destroying picnic baskets. 
---
Try keeping all four of those straight.
---
Who knows. Maybe next month it will be free for 1st. Or not. The oitfit is nothing spectacular anyway.
---
This was every hour during Halloween as making mischief and mayhem was part of the event.
---
You think you have problems people keep killing me
---
Pete Hines does play doesn't he? Remember seeing a post a while back where people followed him round for a while. He even responded to the thread on reddit.
---
Edit: found it https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cfsc54/we_just_protected_a_level_47_private_pete_hines/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Adventure mode is crashing for me all The time. But NW have never crashed. Maybe its something on your end?
---
Swapping them now also costs perk coins..
---
I would use 5 or 6 permantly for my current build now that I've seen the new legendary perks.
---
I‚Äôm ok with it if it means events like the SBQ, project paradise, radiation rumble, imposter sheepsquatch, etc. will actually be completed now. I don‚Äôt care in the least bit what other players have, if they‚Äôve earned it legit, or whatever, because it‚Äôs not a pvp heavy game. We cooperate to get events completed. If we collectively have a stronger arsenal now, good. If you‚Äôre salty that you just don‚Äôt have the god tier fixer you want but someone else does, you‚Äôre just jealous and no one cares
---
I know the difference of hacked and duped and spawned items. Why are you bringing them up when the discussion has nothing to do with them? I'm talking about spawned items like BE15 Gatling Plasma. These types of legacy weapons appeared months after the energy weapon nerfs. And again, i do have them on my mules. EDIT: That ring is not a in game generated item btw. It is not legacy, it's an hacked item. Those rings never dropped legit. It's very clear now that you have no idea what you are talking about :D You lost the last bit of credibility you had with that comment.
---
What advantage does a non-legendary broken sword give exactly?
---
Ive been killing myself with a gat for a year now the respawn bug is a separate issue then the raw force of the gun
---
Yea it stupid to have 2 layer grind 
---
We grind for the treasury note which itself is already time consuming and A GRIND!! Then it time gate 
---
I rather have a 5:1 exchange rate between notes and gold then be time gated
---
Well, that's a problem, wait, what does limits have to do with server stability, did i miss that memo? A few high set valuables should not destabilize an entire server. Is it because the engine's old and they haven't upgraded to the new one yet?
---
I agree to a certain extent, but I still think there should be some content that is only available at certain times, such as holiday content. Other than that I agree entirely that everything else should just be there.
---
My addition to your addition....idk....Is that the legendary modules required to craft the weapons would be 1 for a 1\*, 2 for a 2\*, and then 3 for a 3\*. That would make sense seeing as how they cap your scrip that you can turn in at 150 everyday, and the modules are set to 50 scrip each.
---
So? 
---
You‚Äôre missing the point. 
---
Before bloodied it was Two shot explosive.  that got nerfed
---
if they nerfed Bloodied and Junkies, it will be something else
---
there will always be a meta. A better solution is to eithe buff up the existing effects or add new ones
---
Just a funny thought. Given that XP is awarded to how long a player survives, I would like to see one match where all players waited to the last (or next to last) circle for a massive free for all killing spree. That way the players only wanting to only level for the cosmetic unlocks get the XP they need and the players that enjoy PVP can have a huge bloodbath they want. As a plus, there would be no need to hide in bushes for 20+ minutes. ;) I know it will never happen, but would be wild to experience just once! lol
---
Pretty sure standard vendors are something you can build without learning a plan. It's the different versions that cost atoms.
---
Yup, join or make a public team with INT boost, have someone share Strange in Numbers, eat food EXP boosts, bobbleheads and magazines to help with leveling.
---
I don‚Äôt like relying on rare items to level so I don‚Äôt use bobbleheads and magazines. Having unyielding gear is also great for the INT boost.
---
What a gent  was he on ps4 asking for a friend
---
If you're talking about Adreneline no it's not fixed yet.
---
How long do they actually preserve food?
---
Yes for Camp owner / teammates. 
---
No for other people, to avoid griefing.
---
I figured that one out, its the other way around I can't figure out.
---
I meant in general but ima assume none r fixed
---
Ah my mistake. It‚Äôs early here lol.
---
Wow. It should say, "I had," not "I jihad." Smh
---
No worries!
---
What evidence do you have though, besides speculation ?
---
Builds come and builds go.  mix/max'rs will always look for the best possible to give them an advantage.  It's just how games are.
---
You don't find 3 chests 
---
You find one and then keep dropping right next to it 
---
Or you could just drop into Morgantown airport where there is at least 4 safes that I can think of off the top of my head
---
Saying something else will come along isn‚Äôt a good reason to keep it as is or at all.
---
It just lazy game designing.. 
---
they could remove the 200/day gold limit and just introduce new plans every patch..  if they need more time to create new content 
---
Instead they just time gate us to buy themself time to release new content
---
AngryTurtle on YouTube has awesome videos on all types of bloodied builds. He was a HUGE help to me. Goes over perks, weapons, mutations, armor, what works together and what doesn't. Definitely worth the watching!
---
you dont need to keep tons of all the various junk materials.. for the vast majority of them having between 50-100 is enough.. you probably dont need 800 glass.. 
---
I keep most junk between 25-50 personally.. but I dont base build so I only need a lot of the gear crafting/repairing materials
---
of course there are exceptions to this such as exceedingly rare materials like ballistic fiber or some of the other materials that are used often while crafting/building/repairing like screws
---
make sure you are breaking down all junk before you store it.. sometimes things slip through or require manually breaking them down.. check your junk tab
---
check your misc tab for gunpowder and unsmelted ores.. that is a source of weight that often sneeks past many peoples notice..
---
get rid of heavy ammo you do not use.. you dont use it, why do you have it right? no need to have 30 mini nukes or 200 missiles..
---
as far as weapons and armor go.. scrip or scrap anything youre not wearing or trying to sell..
---
also in regards to vending legendary gear.. trying to insist on getting max top dollar for every mediocre legendary item you come across isnt going to help your stash problems.. those things sit in vendors forever for a reason..
---
if it is a truly desirable weapon.. sell it for a fair price and be done with it.. dont try to get rich quick off it unless you enjoy holding onto shit forever..

I just want these people to have mics.  This game is so dead socially, like most of XBL.
---
My main is 229. I don't understand where you are coming from.
---
I may end up doing this as I do not plan to jump next gen any time soon. I actually have an older laptop that I had upgraded with an SSD a little while back, I may scalp that drive back out and format it for the PS4!
---
Was talking about this last night with a friend. So in Skyrim v you could cast a spell to find corpses. Why can't you create a pill to find corpses?  You could use the corpse flower event or craft of spoiled meat.
---
I proper laughed at this
---
Okay, I‚Äôm not a software engineer in any respect, so I‚Äôm asking a question here- wouldn‚Äôt your inventories only be indexed when you are logged on? I assume they are compressing I used files so they don‚Äôt have to have, like, the entire game loaded at all times, and they can‚Äôt really search these files while they are compressed.
---
So, they would need to either take the servers down to unzip &amp; scan inventories while everything is down, or they would just play a proverbial game of ‚Äúwhack a mole‚Äù banning anyone who loads in with suspicious items. 
---
Or they are banning people based on the other part of the TOS - making posts providing exploit methods.
---
Or they could put measures to prevent this on the front end- such as giving temp bans (like an hour or two) for repeatedly connecting and disconnecting from the servers.
---
Is that somewhere near the mark? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a gross oversimplification, but help me understand wise ones of Reddit.
---
There‚Äôs no security in the world that can keep out someone committed to getting in.
---
The reasons no one is breaking in to your house right now? Most people know right from wrong. And everyone knows there‚Äôs consequences if they do. 
---
Bethesda has been very lax on the consequences side, but they have every right to enforce them.
---
I thought about that, I'm sure it could work but I really wanted to utilize those diner floors, make them capable with the porch foundations!
---
you shouldn‚Äôt be required to run a weight perk just to use a weapon the way it was intended to be used.
---
That too complicated lol
---
&gt; people don't even play like this on a mass scale
---
Yeah, except they do. Every match i kill 3-4 people hiding, and when i spectate people are also hiding.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll check it out.
---
I'll tell you what.. just kill 9, instead.  
---
It'll be our little secret üòâ
---
Could be fun and challenging starting early seeing as you aren't a new player. It'd definitely add a bit of a challenge if you ran low health from the get go and worked around the rads until you got starched genes. 
---
If I wasn't considering switching from bloodied on my main character I'd consider it myself actually with a new one.
---
PC players: "First time?"
---
There are 3 cars across from my CAMP. Every time I get a new weapon I sit on the front porch blowing up cars.
---
Emptied all my ammo into a Grafton Monster only to have someone else get the kill. Then they killed me.
---
Speculation isn‚Äôt evidence. Go read this forum. That‚Äôs evidence.
---
Oh I‚Äôve had the plasma for about a month now and I don‚Äôt like to use it because everytime I kill my self with it I can‚Äôt respawn
---
The nuclear Winter daily challenges take about twice as long to finish than all the other dailies combined due to RNG and players killing you on sight. I have spent more time waiting in the vault than actually able to work on the NW challenges
---
Corvega Combusters
---
Great idea but make it every 10 lvls instead of 50
---
EVERRY 10 lvls and perk coins base off exp after lvl50
---
So every 5,000 exp = 1 perk coins  additional to perk card scrap
---
Thinking it would be easy to just make them glow like with berry mentats until you loot them. Like with containers/scrapper perk in fo4. Would help alot
---
Thanks.
---
3 of my weeklies got ticked off this morning (About 7 hours before reset)  
---
Hadn't been in NW, hadn't obviously been on during the switch over.  
---
3500 SCORE lost, and my ticket response was "Yeah cheers for your support" in the most middle finger way possible.
---
Except nearly  half of us cant play due to an error...
---
You can edit your post. Just not the title.
---
Thanks, makes sense.
---
Doesn't affect me in the slightest... Couldn't give less of a fuck
---
Can't see it happening during normal gameplay although I do wish there was a perk as we already have nightsight, but a Legendary perk similar to the PA Helmet Targeting Mod would be nice - make it leveled eg 1. Live tagets, 2. Dead short radius, 3.Dead larger radius.
---
Maybe I'll eventually be able to find that 3* Radroach at night in the long grass...probably just a pool Vue or lead pipe, but you never know...
---
This isn‚Äôt getting fixed until they figure which old bug they‚Äôre going to  roll in to replace it- always gotta be at least a half dozen going at anytime or it‚Äôs just not fo76.
---
Bethesda: here's an unbelievably tedious grind.
---
Also Bethesda: why do they keep using exploits?!
---
Yeah you're totally toasted on that character.
---
Woah really? Not on around the time of the changeover at all?
---
when i first started on pc, i had a lot of people dropping gear for me, it was really nice! i once had a guy drop 30 stimpaks for me as well, i hope to be similarly generous when i get to be a higher level :)
---
Nice üëç
---
Blackeye's Mirelurk meat is a daily and refreshes at 8pm EST.
---
Fishbones' quest is repeatable, you just have to log out/back in.  It might be server based so logging into the same server might prevent you from doing it again immediately but I never tested it or had it happen.
---
Start picking up every clipboard, you‚Äôll have endless screws in no time.
---
Wow you cats really take this shit seriously. I just dove back in after months and am really enjoying the game.
---
It‚Äôs still stealing money from you for no cost on their end= working as intended.
---
Weird. The two times I had this happen to me pre-Season, I was credited the lost Atoms. 
---
I included screenshots. Did you include any with your ticket?
---
every time I get a mini-nuke as a quest reward. I always go to the galleria, aim straight up and fire. and then wait for it to come down and blow up all the cars in the lot

I actually like the idea of having it be a pool for the week if they won‚Äôt increase the total amount we can get. I rather play one day all day and get all my caps scrip etc for the week since I can‚Äôt play as much as I‚Äôd like.
---
You're telling me 76 devs want MORE MONEY? Color me shocked.
---
And to give some idea, I hit max CP in ESO in a year.  I'm still not done all the side quests, etc.  I never specifically tried to get exp; I just played the game.  And I have 11 characters, so of course levels 1-50 on them were not contributing to the CP pool.
---
Fallout76 I started at beta and got two characters through all the content, ending up around level 90 on one and 70 on the other.  I stopped for a while and picked it back up with Wastelanders; now I have a total of 3 characters between level 114-130.  I often do events like Radiation Rumble, etc. that are mostly for exp (and some scrip).
---
I don't know how long it would take to grind out that many Fallout76 levels, but I can't imagine it's comparable...
---
Universal customer relations speak for looking at their phone while pretended to listen to you talk.  :P
---
Welcome to modern gaming.
---
250 MBPS xbox one x, it‚Äôs the developers side
---
I keep my Junkies Shovel around because it has the 90% reduced weight, so it costs nothing to keep it on me. It is helpful for burying the soldier quest. It is also fun when killing Fireflies at the lighthouse or when killing squirrels at Fasnacht.
---
I think heavy is nice because all of the heavy gun perks double dip into strength, as do the melee perks.  And if you carry a ton of heavy weapons, bear arms is also in strength which makes your heavy guns weigh 90% less. There are no perks for reducing rifle weight, only legendary armor does this. 
---
Commando works well and you can get insane damage numbers, but you‚Äôre pouring a ton of perk points into agility, perception, and luck to get the most out of it which limits you elsewhere. 
---
I think you pick your favorite, and then start a second character with the other build.  You can build an entire character around one fixer or handmade.
---
Personally I‚Äôd level up to 50 and then transition to bloodied, the low health is a killer at low levels without the perks or mutations locked in. Get yourself a good instigating weapon and use high intelligence to start which will help you level faster.  Higher intelligence gives more XP. Joining public build teams which gives you a +4 intelligence boost. Always be well rested and do the feed the people even which gives canned meat stew which also boosts XP.
---
Yes they are all broken. Do not log in, go play another game.
---
The real problem I actually have with this challenge is the simple fact that creatures don't appear very often in nuclear winter.  This past week I'm lucky to have even see 5 creatures.
---
It would be great if you could actually scrap them for something, or sell them to a vendor. I'd like to see a "Travelling Scribe" or "Roving Surveyor" that had a small chance of visiting your camp that would offer to exchange the plans you didn't want for scrip or caps.
---
at least there isnt a cap on treasury notes
---
It‚Äôs like twice as long I think? I don‚Äôt know. I forget I ever put stuff in there until I come back to spoiled food a few days later.
---
Sometimes, I kill myself with it (like when someone stepps in my face in SBQ fight...). I can respawn just fine.
---
Ah yes the wendigo curse
---
I got 3,300 atoms when I got 1st once, idk why it gave me double, but keep quiet and enjoy them.
---
There'll be a lot of this now a lot of new players are joining from the game pass. People for the most part love to be helpful and friendly.
---
It's kinda cool to see a flock of new people outside the vault again lately. I was following a level 5 around morgantown airport earlier but I think they were either spooked by it or not interested in fraternizing as they just did their best to not look at me, like I was an eclipse or something, and ignored anything I dropped so I left pretty quick haha. 
---
Good luck and glad you had a positive experience!
---
I completely agree! Nuclear Winter is a game mode I only recently started exploring, and while it isn‚Äôt my favorite, it‚Äôs a good way to waste time. It is incredibly frustrating, though, when I‚Äôm trying to hunt nine creatures while simultaneously avoiding a ring of fire and 45+ people trying to murder me. I punched most of those animals to death too, mainly because trying to find a weapon would‚Äôve gotten me killed, which means I would‚Äôve had to sit through ten minutes of load screens just to get another shot.
---
Hopefully.
---
Youre not the only one
---
Ok so i don't consider the legendary cards and score system late game content. The reasoning behind this is its avalible to most players. If im level 1 i can use the score system and if im level 50 i can use the legendary perks. Now I as a level 300+ player havent got any more content to actually play and explore besides whatever was added in during the wastelanders expansion.
---
I've been going door-to-door but I can't seem to find anybody that plays this game.
---
i get 999 caps for those marine and BoS =0 i tried for more but didn't sell as well. They sold but slower.
---
You're entire original post is based on the incorrect premise that the root of the issues is bloodied, junkies, and unyielding.  
---
That assessment is incorrect. 
---
I provided quite a bit of history from the game, which is apparently a history you seem to lack if you think that the root of these issues is from bloodied.  You only responded to the part about duping. You ignored the argument that bloodied isn't why there are issues with PVP.  You ignored the argument that bloodied is not the reason we have griefing. 
---
Your entire idea that a weapon doing more damage as you get hurt making no sense flies in the fact that no legendary effect makes sense.  Why do I do more damage at night and less in the day?  How does this gun make me more perceptive?  How does my armor make things weigh less.  Your logic is flawed and you won't accept it. 
---
The fact that you didn't even know the limits on bloodied and unyielding until someone mentioned it further cements that you should just stop talking about things you have no clue about.  You clearly are not in a stage of the game where this type of gear would even make a difference. 
---
What you seem to be missing is if they got rid of the effect, you'd be coming on here in a few months saying they need to get rid of Anti-Armor or Furious. You clearly don't understand the game mechanics and you don't seem to understand the root cause of the issues.
---
Speed means shit for connection. I wish people would stop saying speed matters.
---
Your ping and the quality of the connection matters.
---
It was probably intended for E3 or QuakeCon like last year with the Mechanist and elder coat deals. Not shady in my opinion. For 8 bucks you get 11 dollars of atoms and what will be a rare outfit. People always ask where I got my Mechanist outfit, can't lie it's nice having things that other people can't in this game.
---
they should keep the green glow that they spawn with when they die so you can find them easier
---
They certainly did the best they could, but a lot really couldn‚Äôt be said for the final product, hence the bad stain it left on many of the people who worked on it. I‚Äôll never forget the backlash that was received when the game first launched. I bet that stain still follows some of them to this day...
---
No it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm saying the way these are done is a big contribution to some of the problems in this game. 
---
You failed to understand that.
---
I got a bloodied ss plus 1 strength last week love it that noise your describing is priceless
---
It means they will pass it on to someone wether real or imaginary that will take the blame for whatever becomes of it.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Freaky, I knew Bethesda was messed up and into some weird stuff, but that's way out there.
---
Server wide text chat. It's so much fun joining a team that you can't communicate with.
---
I mean it's not like we are in the year 2020 where that kind of thing is normal.
---
Nope, sevvvveral hours prior. I've put in some grind to this system too, using the XP repeatable. Feels like i'm in an abusive relationship haha
---
Why not both? Some people don't like First and buy atoms from time to time. The atom shop bundles are a nice treat for those players. So it's nice having those back.
---
But also First should be also be offering more than it is. They promised a ton of stuff and only delivered on part of it. I've been considering dropping my sub. The only real reason I've been holding on to it has been private worlds. But I'm not sure I use them enough for the price.
---
Agreed. And it remains to be seen how many resources Fractures Steel would have needed (e.g. for Wastelanders they had to build a bunch of instancing tech and a dialogue system - not sure if they will be so ambitious this time around).
---
The monetization is actually not unreasonable if (and that is a big if) Wastelanders sized content updates continue to be released for free at regular intervals for a long time. Say, one every 14 months on average until 2027. That adds up to a lot of content over time, more than any of the single player Fallouts before, and servers do cost money as well. Many players also just buy the base game, which can be found for less than $20, and never spend more on atoms or the subscription.
---
I would be considering basically everyone in the game has a duped weapon/armor right now. What are they gonna do ban everyone?
---
I don‚Äôt have to run Bandolier to carry enough 5mm or .50 cal. I don‚Äôt have to run Explosive Ordnance to carry enough grenades. I don‚Äôt have to run Batteries Included to effectively use power armor or ultracite fusion cores. The only weight perks i use are Bear Arms because i like switching between loads of weapons, and Traveling Pharmacy because i‚Äôm a junkie and carry lots of chems and stimpacks. And neither of those perks are required to use my weapons effectively. So why should the Gauss weapons?
---
Should Bethesda end game be about "exploring"?
---
Aliens spaceship?Underground biomes? 
---
I'd love more content like nukes. Gives a purpose for old zones to explore
---
It‚Äôs possible to kill all 9 in two runs I did it easily
---
&gt;won‚Äôt balance any other build to compete with Bloodied?
---
Exactly. This is a crucial point. A core system to every single game. 
---
Bloodied build is a well done job with everything interacting like a swiss clock (cards, mutation, gear, etc)
---
The rest, in the other hand is absolute garbage.
---
Theres possible builds right in front of their noses (like noct, berserker) and they just dont do shit to improve/revamp the game.
---
Its so lame i cant even think in the right adjective to label that poor game studio.
---
I do need to start a new character at some point because when I did the wastelanders quests I skipped the whole raiders questline (didnt touch any raider content) which locked me out of some locations which apparently you can access after you finish the game.
---
Which two senses? j/k
---
Good pointers, thanks. I built a character around a JE handmade that I traded for, so I feel ya there.
---
My vats shots are kind of wonky.  They either don't do the normal damage or my stealth crit doesn't trigger.
---
A sticky note board/intranet checklist, and they just type in the request
---
I was team soloing earlier (a bit of an oxymoron!) when a newbie (L6?) joined and took the workbench just down the road from my camp. Didn't have much low level stuff other than some basic plans but I joined in the bench defence adding a couple of extra turrets from my scrap. At the end I got some xp and he/she got a free first aid box with food, chems and some scrap I happened to have on me.
---
Me favorite melee is a Vampire Mole Miner Gauntlet. Sneak and melee/unarmed perks. Guns; I have a bloodied 2 shot vats shotgun, and a Vampire harpoon gun. With appropriate perks, it's awesome.
---
Gonna say, any game company that can afford analytics will listen to them primarily because they are more useful than player feedback most of the time.    
---
Obviously good companies do listen to players as much as they can, but making a good game isn't always the goal, often it's just making as much money as possible with a game which can be a very different experience.
---
Why am I bringing it up? Let me [quote you on your use of the 3rd party stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hoqqro/just_a_fyi_to_anyone_who_has_a_explosive_gatling/fxjflyd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) again. Nowhere in there did you specify anything to do with what exact weapon you‚Äôve been talking about. I‚Äôve been specifically talking about explosive flamers. 
---
And okay, I guess I have a hacked ring that I got from a player vendor. So what? It still has zero impact on you at all, both in PvP and and PvE. Having an extra 5 pounds of a hunting rifle isn‚Äôt doing anything except letting me carry around an extra hunting rifle. That still doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve lost any credibility with the thing that started this conversation: you being an asshole to people that are using legit weapons, duped or not. But, I will thank you for bringing to my attention where the ring came from. I do appreciate the knowledge.
---
I've had it happen with Atoms in the past too (by being online in NW when the change over happened) and I also got my atoms rewarded by customer support with a simple screenshot. Was actually really nice and easy.  
---
I sent a screenshot also this time and i got the following response:  
---

The *Thank you for your patience and continued support* part is the most insulting.
---
Oh shit, is it cents? Damn, I couldnt remember so I just put my best guess
---
Yeah, stuff is even more broken now.
---
My Gauss Shotgun will do almost no damage a lot of the time and then it will 1 shot stuff.  Fighting Scorchbeast and expect to take maybe 6 shots, put 10 in to get it to half, then boom, it dies in 1 shot from half.  Crap like that happening all the time now, never happened before patch 20.  I am using the Enforcer perk now which I never used to thanks to so many perk cards being busted right now.  So maybe it's that but who the hell knows.  This game is riddled with bugs.
---
Was fighting SBQ with a 50 cal and my damage would randomly be double.  It would go in streaks, I'd hit for maybe 9 on the head for a while, she'd swing around and come back then I'm hitting for 17 with nothing changed on my end.  I've seen effects change damage a bit, but I've never seen crazy crap doubling it like that before.
---
It's like some invisible super executioner is randomly happening or something.  Like a magic shotgun or high rate of fire effect.  I dunno.  I'm not going to put the time in to test it.
---
I have only been able to do that daily every other day recently, sometimes requires more time even.
---
Thanks, I don't post much and couldn't fond the edit button. I got it, though. Thanks again!
---
Me too.
---
I am slowly doing main storyline, and just recently started actually trying to do some of the daily score stuff. 
---
Tell ya how long it takes me cause I keep getting distracted by looting, I have had this game since launch and am only lvl 42 and lvl 18(I think) on the board.
---
Are you on PS4? was on a server with someone last night with a very similar nick as yours.
---
You had me worried for a second, these are easy!
---
the highest level I seen was an 893, that's some.seious playtime, myself I'm level 129 with about 400+ hours, alot of those just screwing around
---
...or one explosive arrow
---
This man is a legend, said everything that i could think of about this game.  
---
Take my upvote
---
Well bethesda is the one selling the game as a service without the service part(content).
---
This post kinda has Karen vibes
---
You can get a enough shots in to get credit most of the time but yeah, semi-automatic weapons are not good for boss fights.  I have 5 characters all with different builds and my riflewoman/pistoleer is by far my weakest character when it comes to doing sustained DPS over time.    
---
Sometimes on her when the Queen gets insta-gibbed no I don't get enough shots.  You can do great damage but you cannot do great sustained DPS.
---
Are you a newish player? These would only be semi difficult if you were straight out of the vault.
---
If you blow up the bus in front of Whitespring, there are like 20 cars that go off in succession. So satisfying. Yes, yes, yes!!
---
The limits are in place so people can't run away with the economy.  It forces us to spend our caps and our scrip and not stockpile them.
---
My ONLY wish was that I could turn in more than 20 treasury notes just ONCE so I could drain my stock pile of those.  I feel ridiculous constantly adding to that pile by completing tons of events but only able to ding it down by 20 at a time.
---
I was just saying my personal favorite part of their games is exploring. My comments about endgame content were separate, although perhaps I did a poor job distinguishing that.
---
repeated nuking to fight the exact same enemies every time doesn't count as good end-game content to me. If they expanded it like you said, that would be different. Nuked flatwoods? cool, have fun killing a Scorched Flatwoods Monster and his minions. They are going in the right direction with the Wendigo Colossus, but if it takes them this long every time they want to release a bit of new stuff, they are going to keep losing players.
---
Go to that mall just north east of the brotherhood camp.
---
There a good twenty there easy.
---
Thank you for this junkies guide! Do you happen to have a link for the perks you are using/recommend? Would like to give this build a try!
---
Yeah, I also don't see why a grind is required.  There just needs to be something in place to keep you feeling like leveling up isn't 100% pointless.    
---
Pretty much if they introduce it as is, it will be an almost entirely dead system that will have a very limited impact on anyone's effectiveness, or enjoyment.
---
Really? :D " You mean the body of a broadsider with the barrel of a minigun with a recon scope that shoots orbital strike missiles? Or the cryolators with minigun barrels and beam splitters that are explosive? Or miniguns that fire MIRVs? " :D :D :D
---
And btw we are done talking :D If you have to ask "TSE or Furious Explosive lever action rifle?" this type of question in reddit it shows to me that you are very very new to the game so you don't a clue what you are talking about here :D Another noob blocked.
---
Because there would be people like ‚Äù¬π¬≤‚Å∞‚Å∞" atoms for a fukin blu! BLUE
---
Yes! The had those in Fallout 4 and I always had 10 or so to show off my items (even if it was just for me). 
---
Out of everything, this would be awesome. 
---
Beckett just doesnt look that good in the Garb of Mysteries, and I cant stand to hear about floating in space FOREVER.
---
The power armor one was easy. You find sets everywhere, just pick a piece up and scrap it at the same station you found it at.
---
Is it craft or repair 10 items today or just repair?
---
They don't seem to play their own game, so this would be consistent with that, yes.
---
The thing about Ultracite Calibrated Shocks is that:
---
* I've fought the SBQ *hundreds* of times and never got the plan.  No average player is going to do anywhere near that much.
---
* It's not even that useful.  This isn't like some 3-star god roll Legendary.  It's a bit of extra Carry Weight on Power Armor.
---
But like, remember months ago, X-01 Calibrated Shocks were the same way.  People would hop the Enclave bunker for hours trying to get that plan to show up.  It was ridiculous, especially as Bethesda eventually turned around and added the plan for good one day.
---
I think it's likely that they just don't know and/or don't care to fix it.
---
Something doesn‚Äôt make sense to me from what I‚Äôve been reading. Is this a new legendary effect or a special stat for the particular items? I‚Äôm assuming the latter since the listed weapons from the pts all have 3 legendary effects without the cursed prefix
---
I‚Äôm not collecting weapons, but I have been trying to acquire the rare outfits the past couple months. Via trade or getting lucky and actually finding them in game. Down to a couple left on my wish list, but don‚Äôt see the point in trying to trade for them anymore. Definitely a deflating feeling, what happened yesterday.
---
Leader of the Pack quest has 3x low level legendary wolves to kill. Easy fir anyone but the very lowest level players. Shows up hourly too.
---
Leader of the Pack is low level and guaranteed 3 legendary mobs if you get to all 3 locations.. im over lvl 100 and I still do it multiple times a day...
---
Repair armor or weapons. No crafting this time.
---
Power armor was difficult for newbies.
---
Wow man, sounds like a really hard problem, if only there were a simple solution....
---
Is this cross platform with game pass? Like can I play on my pc through gamepass with Xbox players?
---
I'm one of those people who made an alt.  No way I'm leveling up a 200+ character every day.
---
okay know it all, 32 ms 0% packet loss
---
I can see how that would be very beneficial.  I have had people show up at my camp from my building team and check my vending machine and then instantly leave.  I currently only have one up but would like to know what they are looking for, maybe I have it and could trade.  Also letting everyone know you are planning on going to an event would help immensely.
---
Well writen text pal. Well done! üëè
---
Level 500 should be able to unlock all perks with max ranks, level 500 is already pretty crazy.
---
My rifles uses a lever at SBQ fights to build crits then shoots her in the face with a zealots 50% crit black powder. Usually hits it the region of 1200 damage. It is a lot of fun running around in all that chaos trying to kiad a musket.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I figured, which is unfortunate. I know certain shotgun builds can do a lot of dps but I‚Äôm sure you have to be somewhat close which makes flying bosses difficult.
---
Passing this to the team means, they are probably telling either a dev lead or a scrum master.  development works in sprint cycles. at the start of a cycle, the team meets, some boss (scrum master usually) prioritizes the work. this limits, "being overworked." i put it in quotes since my dev teammates still end up working 60 hour work weeks. so if stuff wasnt prioritized and they had to work on "everything passed to the team," in one cycle they'd have no personal life at all. 
---
I dont work in games, but in my corporate world devs work on different things. some are bug fixes, some are new developments for future releases, some are requests that get 'passed on' based on user feedback or support feedback. I am not a dev and work in support. Sometimes I pass on things to them to make my team's (support team) life easier. Depending what the app is, my team wouldnt be the only one doing this. At the end of the day, the guy paying the bill can determine what is important to them and thus, impact how things are prioritized.
---
I got 5 out of the 9 of the animals then it auto completed as well as the weekly challenge which I had only done 1 so like wtf
---
The point is they have increased them.
---
Before the daily was 1 legendary. Now it is 3 legendaries (which was already the weekly)
---
Seems silly to say but we've all been there. It is an amazing feeling to beat a boss alone.
---
I wouldn't say so. Spawns in lots of places in the forest.
---
I know right?
---
Leader of the pack? Check
---
wixon homestead for 10 weapons/armor repairs? Check
---
easy peasy
---
I‚Äôve been doing this one for legendaries!
---
Edit: wow someone downvoted. How toxic. There‚Äôs always someone lol
---
This is a great idea! This should be a thing. 
---
More use for those tokens and wayward quests!
---
Also they should make use of those claim tokens  from load bearing and add another vendor for them
---
Is Bethesda even sure you can get to level 1500, instead of say reaching level 1024 &amp; dropping down to 1 again?
---
The realism argument is a very poor route to go.  Again the chinese stealth suit is not sealed and yet you can stand in a nuke zone.  Im saying if you have secret service armor + lead lined backpack + Radshield + RADX?? You deserve similar rad resist to a hazmat. I know about invisible rad reduct reduction pa, haz, and css all have, and it knowing that doesn't affect the fact that it is poor game design. You also said "do you think popping a pill is gonna save you from a nuke zone?" And then right after you said "Either mainline the radshield or radaway."  So, does that mean popping 20 pills allows you to walk in a heavily irradiated zone? Say you wanted to retain the endgame equality within the game (which is out the door because people are already just running around at mach 500 with heavy armor that takes years to run out of batteries &lt;- very balanced)  you can just add a certain amount of flat rad reduction to each piece of secret service armor just like  power armor.  Then remove radshield stacking and give that a certain percentage rad reduction too.  That way with both you take like 2-3 rad per sec in a nuke zone instead of around 10-12.  Power armor is making about every other type of build obsolete anyways.  Endgame armor deserves to be competitive with endgame activity.  Endgame non-power armor would benefit light arms/melee users with its rad protection and engame power armor types would benefit tanks and heavy gunners with the perks relating to it aswell as the increased energy and physical protection.  I believe in bethesda because I enjoy their games and have seen them fix (and create) many technical issues in the past.  Im not a coder-man an havent seen their game engine code, so i cannot debate whether their job is easier or not.  That doesn't matter. I'm bringing up this issue because whether its hard or not to implement, I believe it still needs to be done.
---
Its a huge help whenever one shows up to a public event like Uranium Fever or something. They instakill most high level enemies so we dont have to
---
One of my characters was a rifle build that started with pistols.  I had a zealous pipe pistol that converted to a rifle.  I added prime, and it put put good damage although slow.  The challenge is staying stealth for the covert damage  multiplier while a bunch scorched are running around.  
---
 It could take down a level 80 beast (non SBQ) in 5 shots while stealth.  Couple with Mister Sandman at night, and it was better.
---
Ooooh I hadn‚Äôt even thought of doing this. Time to join random teams and share rad-sponge üòà
---
Good point
---
I really don't want to move one of my most played games from my SSD, just so I can test this 75 gig game lol
---
Killing 9 creatures shouldn't have the same SCORE reward as Killing 3 creatures - it's huge difference.
---
LOL. Her ramblings do get old.  Beckett's crack me.  His Mothman dreams are just too funny after the 10th time you hear about it.
---
Man, I enjoy FO76 camp building but I do miss the FO4 mods.  You could really go nuts with it.
---
Congrats!
---
When I have excess stuff I don't want anymore I find the lowest level character. Then just drop whatever for them. Paying it forward for the guy who gave me 5000 Christmas gifts months ago. You'll be suprised how generous some people are if you play this game long enough.
---
Yeah shotguns are kind of a different story.  In vats some shotguns are fking broken and do crazy amounts of damage and you can melt the queen with it but I havent used a shotgun build in a long time so I'm not the guy to ask.  I had a shotgun build before but shes now uses unarmed melee.  
---
I wish we had more character slots so I could make another shotgunner.
---
I‚Äôve started carrying extra in case I come across low levels,make low level weapons etc it all helps :)
---
Nah, not even close. Do they sound like that there?
---
Sugar Grove is your friend. Both for screws and technical data.
---
yeah, it feels good :)
---
They said they would increase over time. Also these challenges are nothing. I'm already at 2/3 legendaries
---
Gotcha. The only one so far I‚Äôve found completely ridiculous was yesterday‚Äôs NW challenge. 3 creatures were difficult enough to find, but I found zero when looking for 9, and gave up. Increasing the adventure mode activities is welcomed through in my book. This makes it so I have to do more than just one event while playing for the day. But I see how this could start looking grim for those that have less time to play and complete them.
---
thank you!
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about lever action, that might be fun. And that sounds hilarious, never seen anyone actually running around with a musket especially on sbq lol
---
That's an awesome idea. I'm going to carry gifts when I can.
---
These are not silly things! Wtg!!
---
P.S. I still get excited about killing these guys everyday.
---
Dont be an asshole
---
Hey while your at it why dont you guys turn Adrenaline efect to a exclusive thing for a Berserker build? Makes more sense to have a berserker build boost stacks of dmg while they rip apart enemies, doesnt it?
---
Honestly and i dont know how, Ward's daily quest is bugged for me.  Everytime I server hop, I have both the quest item and the notice to give it to Ward.  I can complete it treasury notes and all.  I do not know how you can call someone lazy when he can break the laws of physics, is the town doctor, the town farmer, and still has time to find enough time to play a secret protector of Foundation by letting people steal extremely important Foundation property just so he can send a message by relentlessly hunting them down and murdering them through you.
---
The basic vending machine is automatically available in the build menu  scroll right and you come to vendors. They are in that tab. 
---
Any different designs of them are atom shop items. The ones currently on sale can be viewed and purchased there, and to build them just go into build menu scroll to vendors and then scroll along on the basic vendor to see the atom shop versions you bought.
---
I never used the railways I would find until I got a furious explosive and that thing as a automatic in vats does so much damage. I had like 10k spikes because I never used them until I got that and blew through it in no time. Just got a instigating explosive 2 star railway I‚Äôm going to probably sell
---
First Scorchbeast is like a right of passage, and then you have to kill your first 3* SB  in order to claim the your throne as 'Protector of the Lead Pipe!' 
---
I always find Sheepsquatches more difficult than the equivalent SBs. A lot tankier and don't give you breathing space. My melee build can go head-to-head with them but my Gunslinger still needs to duck and dive although she's taken down several despite not having the ideal weapons yet.
---
It was funny, though. 
---
The image of you jumping though the air after an enemy screaming out a battle cry should be a YouTube video series.
---
Same, 125 w/400 something‚Äôs hrs, never see over level 600
---
I'm using the Perk Loadout Manager on PC, and I like the flexibility that it gives me when it comes to builds. So my bloodied guy has perk loadouts for both heavy and unarmed weapons. Since both run off Strength, it's relatively easy to switch between effective loadouts without having to move perk points around.
---
And yes, Heavy Guns without the benefit of Stabilized are entirely workable. The gatling laser, minigun and gatling gun are really sufficiently accurate, it's just the .50 cal that's a bit of a spray cannon. And with a set of bloodied heavy guns, the missing armor penetration really isn't that much of an issue. Stealth sniping is out of the window, of course - you really need a rifle build if that's your favoured playstyle.
---
I feel that the team is small, so is the team that "passes it on to the team", looking at the amount of bugs still present.. I sometimes wonder if my reports and feedback end up in some black hole. 
---
In what world is it ok for gauss weapons to still be bugged or for vats to still be broken? Its been so long since wastelanders released and I still can't reload, sprint or use items most of the time when using the gauss pistol. I have died too many times from this. It's already underpowered and cost me a bunch of bullion plus the mods, at the very least one would expect it would be bug free.. ESPECIALLY AFTER SO MANY MONTHS. It makes me want to foam. 
---
The expansion was a step to the right direction, I wouldn't call it a disappointment, but sometimes the word does pop in my head as I play. The games need at least a full year full of wastelander-like changes/content to be in an acceptable condition and then we polish from there.
---
Disagree. The atoms are worth the price on their own if you were to buy them on the store, private servers and the ability to store unlimited scrap. Do I think the price of FO1st is a little pricey? Yes, but I think you get your money's worth personally.
---
I can't say I agree as a subscriber.  We get a enough atoms alone that if you were to buy them with real money, would cost  more than the sub by itself.  We get our own bleepin server and the scrap box is literally priceless.   Throw in the tent and a few other free goodies and it pays for itself and more in my opinion.    
---
Furthermore, I have the year sub so I'm only paying $8.33 per month before taxes which is much less than I pay for ESO + and I dont get my own server in that game.
---
I always end up with mass amounts of .45,.308 and .38 so I always drop them,and grenades as I don‚Äôt really use them.pipe weapons were a staple for me when I started out so I always drop em,and the occasional legendary if it‚Äôs not suited my character. Pay it forward and all that :)
---
you get more atoms than if you bought them straight up..
---
everything else is gravy..
---
sounds like youre just kinda pissed you cant get old cosmetics.. unfortunately thats how FOMO works.. dont miss any future payments yo..
---
i believe that! i'm sure i'll be just as hyped the next time i run into an enemy like these!
---
no
---
The rotating cosmetics I do find slightly annoying; they should just be adding to it, not removing anything.
---
Agreed.  I never even used to pay attention to the challenges before and now I kind of get excited in a stupid way when I get home from work and see what I gotta do and move my piece across the game board.  It's fun.
---
Looks like I‚Äôll be heading to the old big red rocket
---
100% agree that you get a decent amount of atoms BUT I still think you should get access to previous content.
---
i did find the sheepsquatch more difficult, i used so much ammo during that fight!
---
Well at lest the "balanced" bloody builds will eventually reach that with the massive exp bonus's they get if not already exceeding 1k in levels.
---
Of course you're not forced if you don't want to complete the season but if you do want to get to the end then yes, you are. I don't get how that's so hard to understand.
---
Angry Turtle did a pair of videos on just this subject, using everything the same except for the receiver on his fixer and the associated perks for it. It was about the same duration of combat, with commando just edging out rifleman. 
---
I always use a semi-auto during scorched earth (not solo) and only very rarely miss out on loot. And I almost never fire at her when she's in the air. 
---
The only annoyance for me, like you said, is the constant reloading, but that's not too bad with a fixer (sucks with a handmade though, and I tried it once with a lever, and it felt like I was playing in slow motion).
---
Yeah that seems like it would be irritating trying to stay stealth in hectic situations.
---
We still have like two months.  Everything is gonna be ok.
---
So, what they may be able to do is to award a number of Atoms that would have equaled the rank advancement potential of those lost SCORE points. 
---
I would submit that as a counter request. 
---
For example, if you lost 3500 SCORE, that‚Äôs the potential for 3 ranks, if you were at a lower rank, for example. So they should award you at 450 Atoms. 
---
Try that as a reply and see if you get some traction.
---
I've been trying that event but can almost never get a hit on the legendaries, someone else usually guns them down before I can get there. It's like people know exactly where stuff spawns in every event, and by the time I work it out the enemy is dead.
---
If i see a player with under half health i will ask them if they are a bloodied build. If they don't reply I leave rad sponge on. If someone asks me to remove the perk I will do it as I know low health builds will be pissed if im using it as it breaks their build a bit.
---
I always have Rad sponge and sun kissed perks on and I share rad sponge 90% of the time as im usually helping low level players who don't have radaway or have mutations they dont want to get rid of. And sun kissed is there for just me while I'm playing solo.
---
"The community" is a bunch of likes and dislikes, often around one person's posted opinion.  The likes and dislikes can be pretty nebulous, given for many reasons and its often difficult or impossible to determine exactly what a like or dislike was for.
---
Statistics show you what people were doing.  Since we tend to spend more time doing things we like, and avoiding things we dislike, the statistics *may* show what we're interested in.
---
Unfortunately, with these game mechanics, we're forced to grind for rewards.  Sometimes its a LOT of grind.  So the statistics show that we're grinding a lot.  Looks like we must enjoy it!
---
Hey Bethesda - I don't know about everybody else, but I don't.
---
I emailed them a couple days after wastelanders update over the glitchy quest with feral ghoul blood sample not dropping I cant progress with wastelanders until I can get this quest line fix I haven't got an email back yet.
---
I don't. You could just subscribe for a month and get everything. Current system rewards you for your continued subscription. I think it's fine personally.
---
they'll come to your house and beat the soles of your feet with a length of hose pipe
---
The Wastelanders update does seem to have also added like ~20K new voice lines, which is actually quite an amount for a free DLC, comparable to Far Harbor and Nuka World combined. It remains to be seen though if future major content drops remain both similarly sized and (noting how ESO began to sell "chapters" after 3 years) free.
---
Chances are you won't know it's duped and from what I've read, with all previous duping that's gone on, you'll already have one anyway.
---
I made the character mostly  with black powders in mind as I have quite a few but found a lever while levelling and really liked it so have stuck with it. I discovered the awesomeness of that zealots musket when I went to scorched earth at around level 50 thinking I'm never going to do much but maybe get xp off the adds. Then I fired my first headshot and burst out laughing. My high level bloodied can't even come to that lol.
---
I feel like most of the toxicity just got sifted out and only the people most content stayed through the plethora of bugs early on. Haven‚Äôt had a single bad experience since way back in the beginning.
---
I thought about it, but it was just 250 score. Decided to server hop and do Riding Shotgun for an hour or so to get the repeatable 3x instead
---
'Love it. Time to do the same.
---
I'm around 250 and I've seen someone over 1000 once
---
nothing.. 
---
also.. lol @ mistake
---
Again, I have specifically stated that I was referring to explosive flamers. 
---
If you really went that far back to read through all of my comments and posts, then more power to you, I guess. If you had read more into that post, you would have seen that I was switching from an explosive ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù build to a stealth rifleman build, and wanted to get the best opinions on what to use before spending perk points and caps. I have, again, been playing since the BETA. If you really, really want me to dig up the email receipt with the pre-order, I‚Äôm sure I could find that for you. 
---
By the way, good luck finding that bloodied explosive handmade. That‚Äôs another one, just like the TSE flamers and TSE handmades, that you likely won‚Äôt find a legit drop of, since you seem to be particular about that. And have fun typing ‚Äú:D‚Äù over and over again. Maybe it makes you feel like you‚Äôve made your point. Maybe you need to do that to feel like you‚Äôve won an argument against some stranger online. I dunno man. Have fun blocking me. Usually people do that during arguments because they don‚Äôt have an actual point to defend.
---
More or less, just like all online multiplayer games when you reach the end of content. Nothing new here. Its not fun but that's how it is.
---
My wife and I are jumping on tonight after work and kids are chilling. We both have mics!
---
Going my way?
---
I'm not complaining about the amount of atoms you get, I just feel that the atoms is not cutting it when there isn't much to buy and you missed previous content - and can you blame me for being hesitant for taking the plunge? Surely I cannot be held accountable for missing out on some cosmetics that I like due to the state the game was in (and I wasn't prepared to pay more money into a game that was in the state it was in)
---
I just feel its not that hard to give 1st members some exclusive backwards access here and there..
---
There's two Cop Caps with the same name, one of them has Responders colors and should have been awarded the same time you got the Responders Police Uniform.
---
What's with all the running around does my head in
---
No, most likely they wont delete it. And you most likely wont be banned. Weapons are greatly duped sadly in the past and they will be duped in the future. If they start a banwave, they had to ban 90% of the playerbaser, and most of them are clueless buyer, not duper.
---
The "better inventory" mod, but built in. Being able to see weight per tab, per stack, etc is a real help.
---
If it has a red band, it is part of the set.
---
Here's what works for me and I did it in two runs. Spawn in an area that's an open field with maybe one or two spots that could have weapons. Grab weapons and avoid areas you had seen other players on the spawn map. Walk along the fire line and keep with it (usually safest away from players). New creatures spawn after each circle closing. VATS spam 360 degrees so you can find the creatures who are out of your compass range. Hide in a bush far away from where the action could be. More often than not enemy will spawn close.
---
Good luck.
---
Ready to go, blue?
---
I've done just that, thank you for the suggestion. I'll reply here if/when i hear back from them.  
---
Can't help but feel incredibly bitter however.
---
My Gunslinger can take down most enemies without issues and can deal more than enough damage to SBQ to get full rewards. I switched it to Bloodied and its certainly earning its keep even though I currently only have a Quad Pipe Revolver and a Stalkers Bolt Action. If I can keep out of the SBQs focus and maintain Stealth I can hit anything from 30-300 damage for headshots making passing minimum damage quotas a breeze. Can't wait to find Bloodied pistols and have some real fun.
---
You have no way of knowing, but can reasonably assume there‚Äôs a 99.9% chance that all the god roll weapons are duped. Same chance that nothing will happen to you or the weapon that you buy.
---
They could just put up the previous items at a discounted price for those who missed it for free? No?
---
I have one of each, and I prefer the heavy. I use a gatling gun on that one, and with VATS I use it like an automatic rifle. I'm hardly ever in PA, and in sneak most of the time, so it's pretty similar to playing a stealth commando. The difference between that and my actual stealth commando is with the heavy's high STR, carry weight is so high it's practically an afterthought. 5mm ammo is INCREDIBLY cheap per round, and it's not like the gatling uses a ton of it. The 500 round magazine never sees me stop to reload. If I want to play another kind of build for a minute, I can easily switch to shotguns or melee without moving any SPECIAL points.
---
Stealth commando character has low STR and carry weight is just over half what the heavy's is. .45 ammo to feed the Fixers is more costly to make (and a lot harder to find in vendors). Builds are limited to commando and rifleman, unless I want to move SPECIAL points. I can sneak a lot closer to enemies, and often can go undetected altogether, and overall DPS is higher. But it's still a limited build, and not being able to devote a lot of points to INT means it also levels more slowly.
---
The heavy didn't start out heavy or bloodied. I was well into the 100s before I started making the switch. I planned the commando from the start, and used the heavy to supply it with the good gear as it leveled until it reached 50 and could use the top-tier stuff. I would definitely recommend planning your build out from the get-go. It cost about 50 levels worth of points to switch the other one over.
---
That would be nice, reactivate the welcome mat but only effect the owner and anyone on the team. SO simple but I hate to say I think it will be too hard for Bethesda to do this.
---
Totally agree
---
And then when they do hit it, watch them try to find it too. At least the fireflies glow a little, and I still lose about half of them after I shoot them
---
As an inaugural run of their new system it must be a bit of an embarrassment for so many people to be affected by a bug that should have been fixed before launch.
---
Sadly i have lost the cap but not the uniform ): But still thanks.
---
Same it‚Äôs a really good battle pass
---
Anecdotes also aren't evidence.
---
I‚Äôll definitely have to check those out! It just seems like auto rifles/ heavy is the way to go for dps along with range and magazine size. Seems like playing anything else is just for fun and in the back of your mind you know you could be doing better damage with auto.
---
Yeah, I don't know about this one anymore. I've been playing since May and have had Purified Water for sale in my vendor since my second day playing (price ranging from default recommended down to 4 caps) and haven't sold a single one. I still have them listed to see if they ever do sell, but now I just drop little care packages for any lowbies I run across.
---
Any camp really.

The guy with the camp at the top of a monorail structure üëç

I fast travelled to it.
---
Fell and broke my legs.
---
Got attacked by mirelurk queen and king ü§®
---
I would be laugh so hard if you find yourself banned... if you ever bought any weapons/items from the market or from any player vendor, there is a chance it is duped and you never could know the truth.
---
Thanks i have the uniform but i am missing the cap now.
---
On that note, are people actually buying mini-nukes, missiles and all those heavy stuff? I tried selling those for a few days now but I just want to dump them because of how heavy they are ... IIRC I tried 10 caps/missile and 45 caps/mini nukes but I have no idea howmuch caps people are willing to pay for those.
---
I love the community for this game! I‚Äôve played since beta and never had a major issue with game,only the odd slight glitch,but nothing major,and too see the community that‚Äôs built itself here,it‚Äôs great :)
---
PS4 :)
---
I hit level 35 just doing XP and the challenges. If you're just doing challenges yes it's going to be hard. They want you to play the game (which in turn gives you XP which in turn gives you score). Make you're in game intelligence high so that you maximize XP gain. We can't play a game the way we want we can only play it the way it is.

I fucking hate this guy, he doesnt even fit the Settlers who are supposed to be farmers and chill out folks, why did bethesda made him an asshole.
---
 Also after getting max rep he tells you he got his eyes on you and how the quckly you recover the equip the better. Just seems rushed and immersion breaking.
---
I give free insurgent outfits and hats to low levels that join my public team
---
Yeah I'd say that'd be a suitable compromise!
---
At no point did I attack the CMs. Nor is that my intention as I happen to respect them for what they do.
---
All I want to know is who this "team" that gets our feedback actually is, how they deal with said feedback, be it constructive, negative, mean spirited, whatever you want to call it, and, on pressing issues, return the favor and actually let the CMs pass the reply to the feedback back to us.
---
If that's mean spirited, so be it.
---
Enjoy. Also most people who do the come here signal are trying to give you something or show you something, I'd follow them xD
---
The daily tasks only "don't work" or auto complete if you're connected to the servers/playing the game at reset time, which was 30 mins ago. Make sure you aren't on at that time each day and they'll work :-)
---
Sneak multipliers make Commando more resource efficient. You can get some good damage out of harpoon guns or flamers, but they'll lack the DPS of a good rifle. Use Unyielding armor for most situations since extremely high Agility is basically invisibility, then Chinese Stealth Armor for nuke zones. You can try to use power armor, but lacking those Unyielding bonuses to your AP and needing to use fusuon cores means both less frequent VATS crit streams and carrying heavy stuff you could do without. Another huge advantage of stealth Commando is getting hit less. I only carry 5 stimpaks on my stealth Commando, and almost never get diseases(other than the Blight which is inescapable and negligible). As far as weapons go, Fixers are king with Handmades still being rather good. Other weapons just can't compete with their damage output, even if they're excellent in other ways.

Bloodied heavy gunner basically requires power armor, both due to Stabilized and the fact that if you want good range you can't rely on fairly quiet Flamers. T-65 will give you marginally better protection than any other PA, but just about any PA with Emergency Protocols is golden. If you just want a full set with mods right now, Excavator or X-01 is the way to go since it's only caps that are required to get mod plans and short quests to get the part plans. Prime LMGs are the go-to serious damage, but you'll want something more economical like a Gatling Gun for your general purpose adventuring. There aren't any wrong choices in heavy guns, but nothing compares to the instant DPS you get from an LMG.
---
Avoid Auto Stim armor pieces and the Medic Pump torso mod while running low health like they're the plague, because they are. Their effects proc when a radroach farts in your general direction, so they just waste your stimpaks on nothing. Medic Pump is even worse because it has no cooldown and procs on every hit you take. You could technically use Medic Pump to tank Imposter Sheepsquatch, but you would go thru hundreds of stimpaks in seconds(I have done this).
---
Yep - previous versions of FO taught me to hoard stuff, too.  Unfortunately, that habit carried over to 76, and I‚Äôm still paying the price - no fast travel, and I love my WR armor and Excavator.
---
Most things are relatively easy to come by once you learn where to look/what scraps for what.
---
By and large, you wont need more than 100 of any item (acid, Steel, lead, screws, springs, gears, ballistic fiber).  Even acid need is low if your build is not heavy guns so you dont need to make tons of ammo.
---
You‚Äôll need ignificantly less of others - gold, cork, concrete, leather, cloth, etc.
---
Fusion cores seem scarce at first, but there are many ways to find them (and they are heavy.
---
Aid items will sneak up on you weight wise, so will weapons.  You‚Äôll evenually develop a couple of favorites that work well for you.
---
Sell your excess to bot vendors.
---
Damage is definitely bugged. I notice it the most with Guided Meditation, Uranium Fever, and hunting scorchbeasts.
---
It seems like there's two (or more) things going on here:
---
1) A vats accuracy bug where hits aren't registering at all and the health appears to rubberband back to where it was.
---
2) Sneak or other damage bonuses randomly breaking and not applying to enemies. It will display the full damage amount, and a hit will register, but only a fraction of that damage will be applied. This is especially annoying in vats because vats will exit thinking the enemy is dead when they are not.
---
I have died several times due to these bugs and being unable to deal damage.
---
When you see one, just block them.  It will be like they don't even exist.
---
I find the dialog is bugged for me. Have to say happy to help, then ask about how he got there, then ask about something else, then say I heard he needed help.
---
Same
---
Overall how do you like gunslinger? Bosses aside it seems like a fun build to run around the wasteland with. The stealth thing puts me off a little though, do you find it difficult to stay stealth for sbq or do you have a method?
---
I'm enjoying it, although it can be a slog at time. Really only interested in 4 or 5 rewards though and I'm currently in a dry spell and will have to live off crumbs of atoms, caps and scrip to maintain enthusiasm. Don't mind all the challenges as I find most are completed during the normal dailies anyway with just a few bits of housekeeping thrown in for vao. So far none have been a real chore.
---
yeah.. I like it
---
I enjoy the grind.. its kind of what I signed up for with this game
---
This is a challenge I can definitely support!
---
I have a fixer that someone gave me awhile back that is a 0 star and I can't break it down. Does that mean it is duped?
---
I didn‚Äôt give any anecdotes. 
---
a short amusing or interesting story about a real incident or person
---
Pointing out the number of posts about bloodied and junkie posts abc duping is called using data. Not complete data. But it‚Äôs still data. 
---
Are you saying there are no posts about bloodied and bulked other than this post?
---
I would say he's related to Preston Garvey - which would explain a lot.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, I never would have thought lol
---
haha yeah this was the first and only (so far) score challenge I skipped. I mean I had trouble enough with the kill 3 creatures. 9 in one day just wasn't worth my time lol
---
So events and take workshops for plans.
---
Totally agree with this.  Last few SBQ runs have been surprisingly stimpack expensive.
---
I play melee so I'm right on top of the queen.  She now spawns scorched directly beneath her (or I just noticed this because the damage increase). Mirelurk Kings and Yao Guais rock my world. Even more so now.  I have to jump/jetpack to evade and stim.  Never had to do that in the past.
---
Whats the length of the hose?
---
Polymer is the DR mod, shadowed is the secondary mod...u can have both
---
I lost 3 weekly score rewards, and 3 daily score rewards on Tuesday adding up to 4500 score.  Due to work I have never been on even close to the reset, and was on that day at 6pm eastern - 6 hours after the reset.  I know the old problems with atoms were normally tied to nuclear winter or being on at reset, but there was no correlation for me to the atom bug when it happened on Tuesday.  The ones that bugged out were repeat ones I completed the week prior.
---
No it‚Äôs a heavy I think
---
You don't honestly think their Board of Directors actually care about playing video games, do you? These guys are suits looking for cheques, they very clearly have no passion for gaming, or we wouldn't be in this situation.
---
I do find in some events you get the uber obsessed player pushing in the way. My hate is the Gauss Shotters who will fire at your back to take out enemies you are inches from because they know they are safe from reprisal with pacifist.
---
It's just such a shame, that they basically force us to install it to the system drive, which in most cases has only a few GB left nowadays.
---
Was looking forward to testing it on game pass, but this is just bullshit.
---
Is it double xp weekend?
---
with 2 more difficult days in a row, and mostly __based on kill 3 legendaries__ im wondering if something got boogered and weekly challenges somehow got into the daily challenge list
---
But the weekly is complete 3 NW challenges for 1000.  I already skipped one (the Lockpick I think).  Wanted to sandbag at least two just in case we get more difficult ones later in the week.
---
I have about 1000s in over 5 characters.  Not as high a level as some people because I have a tendency to dick around in camps or do things that don't necessarily get the highest level. 
---
I still love playing this game.  I think some of the grinding could be tuned down.  As much as I love this game, doing the same quest for ward every sing day, on 5 characters... can be a bit tedious.  I'm not asking for a lot, just some other options for grinding the faction that is more than "go fetch this item for me"
---
I'll sometimes take breaks from the game, play something else for a bit, then come back.  It's a bit tough with SCORE since it's limited time, but if I absolutely need a break then I can understand I'm not entitled to everything. 
---
To answer the original question.  I find I don't really enjoy the game until I hit level 50.  At that point I get to focus and refine my character.But I have felt that way in any MMO/Grinding game I have played.
---
BTW here is a online copy of the complete transmission.  Recorded it yesterday and Im gonna do some demodulation see if I can pull out something understandable or some kind of pattern recognition or digital data, morse code?
---
Thing is in terms of FO76 and technology what does anyone think the type of tech would this be?  Almost sound like a single side band (SSB) transmission or some kind of PCM? but I found something that might let me do some analog magic on the audio.

Also to me clearly starts saying 3 million but I cant make out what is said at the end.
---
Is the windows 10 version play with the xbox players?
---
Correlation does not equal causation.
---
Edit: In other words, just because you see posts about duping bloodied weapons doesn't mean that bloodied is the root cause of the issue, and doesn't mean that getting rid of bloodied would solve it.
---
If it's zero stars, just generic, that can be crafted in game at any point
---
I agree that I‚Äôm not so excited about the caps and repair kits, but the board game feel and going to claim the reward still gives me satisfaction.
---
‚ÄúI did a thing!‚Äù
---
I've completed it and moved on to the secret level
---
Lol! Way to avoid the question with a useless statement because you are afraid to answer the question. 
---
Later!
---
Ever find a fix?
---
wouldn‚Äôt put it past them
---
Nope. the LMG is a heavy weapon
---
14 inches
---
750 hours in and level 325... that would take me thousands of hours!
---
Statistics don‚Äôt lie.
---
I‚Äôm listening
---
I am doing the same and have rolled quite a few 3\* SS Unyielding pieces its just that the weight metrics (ammo/junk/food) are not as good as the mixed set of Unyielding I currently use.  Yesterday I went to the Murgh to burn some script and she gave me an Unyielding SS 3\* chest piece with ammo weight but my right leg piece already gives me an ammo weight reduction.  Of course you can't sell it and have to give it back to her.
---
The Lakeside Cabins workshop usually only has 1 ghoul to kill before you can claim it. Take that workshop, wait for the defense event to complete that as well then log out and server hop to repeat the process. That will get you some decent XP and 2 plans each time at lower levels.
---
As far as I can tell this pack is going to be a permanent addition, not limited time like the previous atom+outfit bundles, which is why its separate from Fo1st.
---
 Congrats! Next you have to solo encrypted
---
What is this trick you speak of???
---
just a suggestion but get any kind of a tesla (semi auto works best but any legendary effect if you can get one) and fire it at the ground near small enemies, you can thank me later...  
---
I wish it was easier too, but I suppose I've settled in regards to aiming at small enemies...
---
nothing. duped items are not traceable.
---
Who even thought 1 daily per faction was alright imo,eso least has 5 and more for just crafting to get more stuff . God eso does it so much better, its still a grind cause rng but least theres a fuckton of outlets and even insurance in the form of transmute stuff which does have a limit but your gonna use it up and then get more, its not locked behind a reset lol.
---
WE ALL GOTTA BE KARENS &gt;:C
---
I don't have any considered good plans and as said scrapped em all we're one star so don't have em on me
---
That's funny, it's like turning the lights out and all the insects come running out.
---
Yeah I have the plan and have it fully modified.  It shows up in my weapon list and is not a favorite.   I can drop it, but it does not show up when I try to scrap it.  I guess I will just sell it.
---
ie5 is still mandatory at bethesda i hear
---
No, you will not be banned.
---
I have, and have had for months and months, legendary rings, 3\* one and 2x 2\* ones, also  Gilded legendary miniguns etc. These are things I shouldn't have, if anyone would be banned for questionable items it would be me.
---
No, I didn't make or buy them like a douche on ebay btw. Got them from a rage quitter :-)
---
P.S Played on PTS with them also, so you think they'd spot it there if anywhere..
---
That's quite strange, if it's not a legendary it should be scrapable
---
You said "This forum is evidence".  this forum is a small segement of the overall FO76 community.   
---
By your own admission its not complete data.  So who are you to make the jump that bloodied is the root cause?  
---
Further, my statement isn't useless but proves you have no idea what you're talking about.  Your logic is "There are posts about people duping bloodied weapons, bloodied prefix must be the problem". 
---
Just because you are seeing an increase in the number of posts on people duping bloodied weapons, doesn't mean that bloodied is the root cause.
---
You haven't provided any evidence based on your original statement that bloodied is the reason that PVP is imbalanced.
---
You haven't provided any evidence based on your original statement that bloodied/junkies is the reason for griefing.
---
You haven't provided any evidence at all. You tell people "look at the forum" by you are just going by what posts you have seen and could easily be suffering from some confirmation bias.
---
If you are going to make statemetns as you are,  you better do some research and actually provide it.
---
Maybe it's like the vendors I've used in telecoms before. They play up like they are a massive conglomerated place, but have like 2 people in the US pulling quadruple duty, 2 guys in the EU and a few PMs.
---
My dialogue with Blackeye is always bugged. I have to talk to her, exit the conversation, say I have mirelurk meat, exit the conversation, then give her the meat. I always have to talk to her 3 times.
---
Also, she runs straight to her bed as soon as she sees me. Like, as soon as I she‚Äôs visible she makes a beeline for her bed.
---
Regular Nuclear Winter challenges will count for that weekly and I believe that there is one regarding Stimpacks.
---
&gt;new player
---
I don‚Äôt think suggesting somebody that just started to go bloodied is the most helpful piece of advice.
---
Lol. Because I‚Äôm supposed to use people who don‚Äôt talk about the game? 
---
What you‚Äôve literally said is the people who post on this forum don‚Äôt count. 
---
Since Ed don‚Äôt count, why are you even bothering?
---
prosnap camera shows what its aimed at in the upper right of the display..
---
as long as the corpse hasnt sunk under the map(which does happen) you can find a hidden corpse with it..
---
the thing to keep in mind is.. due to the way mobs ragdoll when you kill them.. they are sometimes farther away from where you killed them than you might guess.. especially on uneven ground..
---
I just recently found out my new shotgun blows up cars in one shot. I found out the hard way first. But man, the parking lots at Whitespring are fun if I keep my distance!
---
Yeah it was confusing me.
---
I have 3x basic Unyielding plus a chameleon armour piece for the Stealth (and a random good piece to fill the gap, with Chinese Suit for silo runs). Against SBQs I crouch away from the main group of PA Heavies who tend to get all the attention due to their habit of painting the sky with Gatling Lasers. My revolver is quick firing and long ranged enough to tag many of the queen's minions too and as she circles I'm often up on a fence scanning for them (you don't have to watch the queen, the volley of lasers will cue you to when she approaches again).
---
Its still a build in progress, L130 but lacking the ideal weapons in particular, but its fun and feels far less clunky not wearing PA especially with high agility and mutations. Now if I could just get VATS to work 100%...
---
I hope they make it so we spawn closer to your base because most of the time I spawn far away from my base and its annoying so hopefully they can fix it
---
Shots not counting, in general, and how that has progressed from being a rapid-fire or shotgun phenomenon to being something that affects even slower Lever Action Rifles, is proof positive that no one plays their own game. Because that's such an egregious bug.
---
I actually love this game.  I played at launch, took a break, came back for Wastelanders.
---
The early game was a mixed bag.  The bugs/glitches were horrific.  I mean, really bad.  It was totally unstable, quests wouldn't complete, you could get kicked out of server, weapon/vats damage was all over the place. It was pretty depressing.
---
However. The story for FO76 (which I won't spoil) is one of my favorites.  It is a really good story, told in a unique way. The world is lovely, fairly vast, but in the beginning felt very lonely without NPCs. Wastelanders has fixed that lonely feeling with NPCs, factions etc.  
---
Score and gold are nice additions and I do enjoy grinding.  I generally assume there is a grind built into every RPG. Or the ones I gravitate to.  What surprises me is that I'm really digging Camp building.  That's kinda my real endgame now.
---
It means one of the following. Take your pick:
---
We "will' pass this on to the team.
---
We will "pass" this on to the team.
---
We will pass this on to the "team".
---
This is wholesome. I like this. Keep being good, OP.
---
I still love it too.  Not crazy high level (120) but I love that you can wander around and discover little things and areas that are not marked on the map (CarHenge).  Legendary Run is fun, NW I never touched before LR - but it is growing on me like a 'shroom from a sloth's back.  
---
But I really did like the early game - I've always liked the story and lore that the series has and enjoyed learning more about the area and the events leading up to the prior games' events.
---
It's funny how they make you have to do different builds to be good, yet expect you to need that many levels to unlock things. Like bitch please, you think I'm going to get 3 characters to level 1500? Or even each to level 300 at best? I felt the same way with wastelanders, I didnt wish to have to grind rep on three different characters
---
https://imgur.com/Mkkpa3z
---
You have to be fucking joking. Level 1500? WHAT THE FUCK BETHESDA? WHAT KINDA CRACK YOU SMOKIN THAT MAKES YOU THINK WE'LL MANAGE THAT?
---
I‚Äôm out
---
Fixers aren't able to be scrapped. The mods are obtained from scrapping the combat rifle, but I have no idea why we can't scrap it for materials at least.
---
No way all those people are still on the project. After a certain point they'd go down to a smaller maintenance team and move people on to new projects or even planned expansions for 76.
---
I personally love it.
---
Me and my buddies headcanon that we did our own heist onVault 79, with the combined powers of our small player faction. Woulda been pretty interesting if we actually had the option to do that, but I digress.
---
Ye, for me that is impossible, I am using a cloud PC and I cannot format my boot drive, only my other partitions. 
---
Guess we will have to survive without FO76 :)
---
Or, ya know, 3 months...
---
I'd like that even as a daily.
---
A step too far is a huge ass understatement
---
And not have every legendary robot explode. I‚Äôve seen the Squatch get flung so far down the hill from the pylons.
---
All the power armor spawns were empty yesterday. You would need to be server hopping for a long time.
---
Once again, you are acting like an excited little puppy who hears their master say "Things aren't going to work out", and only focus on the word "out" and think your going for the walk.
---
Considering your apparent inability to even read an entire reply to you, how do you even know that bloodied is the issue, using just the forums? 
---
How do you know that bloodied and junkies is the reason for the PVP imbalance? 
---
Maybe try reading and responding to the full reply to you instead of seeing the first sentence and responding to that. 
---
All things considered I'm not even thinking you'll get this far in my response...
---
I spend my time trying to figure out how to manage my weight so I can fast travel. Literally spent 2 hours last night debating on what to drop. I still haven't finished. 
---
I did cheese the game with the weight carry glitch long ago so its my fault.
---
With a cooldown, so you don't crash the servers lol
---
Idk. I just hope Beth does something, although I don't know how that can track individual items.
---
FYI, completing NW challenges (like build X defensive structures) fulfills that weekly, not just SCORE challenges
---
I mean we can't even try to make a shortcut to the exe, then have it set to "run in" in the System drive and fake it that way, since if you start the exe directly, you can't even get to the login animation.
---
You‚Äôre just all over the place and a moving target. 
---
You realize I don‚Äôt care what you think. Hence the short replies. Your view isn‚Äôt worth debating.
---
But meanwhile, enjoy this.

Not trying to be rude but sharing an account violates the tos I believe just be sure to check up on this as any future complaint can be made void if you admit you are sharing an account with someone else ( or banned for a different reason)
---
Oh and Bethesda is weird they do what they feel like but you should be okay in comparison to the amount of steel stable flux and weapon duping going on right now
---
I have a vendor labeled "lore" with some of the more interesting or obscure holotapes for 0 caps each. Hopefully this will finally get someone to "buy" one. I thought it was a fun idea since they're weightless but no one else seems to agree. :P
---
hard copy? you mean on console? PC never really got a hard copy. the "hard copy" was a box with a code inside of it
---
I‚Äôm level ninety on my main but I have played since near launch and I understood how hard it was at the begging game with garbage weapons and not a lot of ammo so I made sure to keep all my low level gear and repair it so people can have it for free out of my vending machine and it gets emptied out all the time by high levels and it just makes me mad
---
Considering this is only week 2 that may be a bit of a premature conclusion.  I say we hold tight and see where it actually goes before losing our heads over the whole thing.
---
Reduced weight on a shovel is a god roll.
---
Shitty plans get duped too my friend. Got any mounted plans? All duped
---
I have this weird thing in open world games, where I tend to go "***OO SHINY!***" a few moments after getting a quest and end up on the other side of a game a few hours later by the time I remembered I had an objective.
---
To put that into context for FO76...   
---
I have 589 hours played.  
---
I'm not allied with either faction. One I think is still half way through Cooperative.  
---
I have like 300 treasure notes on me and maybe 3500 bullion actually collected since starting in Wastelanders. And the only thing I bought was farmable tiles.
---
Yes, the bugs annoy me to no end. Some times even infuriate me. But... it's something I've also become accustom to with Bethesda products over two decades. So maybe I can tolerate it more than others? I don't know... All I do know is I still find things to do and enjoy my time.
---
As for burnout... that's something every online game suffers. One of the prime examples is WoW. No matter how much they hate the game's current state, every season, every expansion, they refuse to leave to find something they *do* enjoy. And is the main reason it's community is a toxic dumpster fire.
---
Now, take player that mentality, and toss in Bethesda's "Fear Of Missing Out" marketing strategy, and it just gives them even more reason to hang around like a stubborn burr. Then they went and added the limited time Season Boards to add more kindling to FOMO. Oh boy.
---
to accelerate the speed of your water pump, you drink from it first and then mash the "collect" button. mid animation it will act like any body of water.

This is so good I could prob turn in those photos to ward for some rep ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
If your ultimate goal is to be a dick and achieve total boredom, then there are build guides on YouTube.
---
Yeah I am enjoying the wastelander storyline. I'm not even sure what the base storyline is since I only started playing after wastelanders. Excited to see how it unfolds.
---
I also love the camp building, although that was one of the biggest, if not THE biggest, reason my fiance and I wanted this game in the first place. So no surprise there. We love coop base building like this. My enjoyment skyrocketed once I started taking my camp more seriously lol
---
The SCORE system is pretty engaging and got me back in to Nuclear Winter but it just feels like a chore after a while. I'm honestly close to just saying fuck it and logging off for a few months though or until the Brotherhood comes back, Captain Cosmos PA skin doesn't seem that worth it.
---
I run junkies explosive heavies on my main, and agree that ammo is incredibly cheap and easy to craft. Perhaps that will be one of the deciding factors. But then again, I already run heavies. I don‚Äôt know what to do, except I do know I don‚Äôt want to do melee.
---
One set of armor with all -20% weapon weight. Walking arsenal that plays the game like the Witcher, planning out each fight. I just keep an AA/FFR weapon on that guy for big mixed groups like during SBQ.
---
Well, I could be doing better damage if I were bloodied, but I'm not. Yeah, I'm pretty casual, so I don't really care about things like dps, as long as I'm not wasting tons of ammo for nothing. But like I said, even in those fights where she's down in the first 5 minutes, I get loot so I'm happy. I use a zealot's primed fixer for the SBQ as added insurance, but I've used a primed executioner explosive one too and had no problems generally, despite the kind of bad rolls for that event.
---
Repair ten items? It's the only one I think is weird, I barely do that during a week for normal play, do they expect us to repair random gear we find while playing? Sometimes it feels like they don't even think about or try some of the things they add, because so many of the things they add are just a hassle or something that you really have to go out of your way to do. The NW ones especially, where you basically have to ignore the regular game which can sometimes make a match worse for those who actually play it for fun.
---
Imo the gauss shorty shits on a lot of the legacy guns
---
Yes on console i thought it would be easier than having to deal with switching the discs so i switched to game pass and here we are
---
Or use a stream/river and do the same :-)
---
That's awesome!  I tried to get my kiddo into it (he's 12), but he's so stuck on Fortnite I usually have to play that with him instead lol.  He does get on it gradually, but he's only in the single digits on his level.  If you're on PSN my only recommendation would be to make sure his area chat volume is down as I ran into someone that got my blood boiling in anger so much I was shaking at the things he was saying.  All over something him and one of his teammates thought I did.  All I kept thinking of was how furious I'd have been if my son heard him mouthing off.  
---
They could have just asked me to get on the area mic with them and what my intentions were (common sense/intelligence required for that I guess), but they decided to jump into discussions of make genitalia, politics, and more.  All over my punch to my teammate.  If I'd known their teammate was going to drop down behind mine right as I hit R2, I wouldn't have bothering pressing it at that time.  Still, their verbal assault was unnecessary.  Especially when younger players are on.  
---
Complete opposite experience two days later meeting an older gentleman that told me he was retired and almost lvl 400 because he has the free time these days.  He upgraded my PA and one of my guns I was trying out.  Goes to show there are awesome people on there and people that don't care to offend anyone with their unhappy, teenage anger (even if they sound like a grown adult).  
---
I'm new to reddit btw, so I won't list the dudes name since I found he has been on here longer than myself.  Always wanted to check reddit out but never did until guy made me so angry I googled his PSN and ended up on here.  Also found a woman on Twitter that posted about him too.  But I recorded it to report to Bethesda and Sony since Bethesda mentions on their support site to also report to console manufacturers.  We'll see what they eventually do I guess.  If they don't do anything them I guess they're cool with cyberbullying.
---
&gt;Or use a stream/river and do the same :-)
---
I thought that was SOP for gathering water.. I didnt think anyone really used pumps for gathering even with the glitch..
---
-Edit to fix quote
---
I‚Äôll have to let you shoot a JE laser sometime. It‚Äôs awesome
---
and have you went back to disc?
---
I don‚Äôt agree with a lot of the choices Bethesda has made with this game either. But they‚Äôre a business that has to show that people are playing their game and that they have even more people joining in. Why do you think they make you grind so much and why did they add their game to game pass? To show their investors that this game is alive and well and will still make a profit.
---
&gt; But meanwhile, enjoy this
---
Congratulations, you just proved duping is the issue, not Bloodied/Junkies.
---
check your PS4 capture gallery.
---
Unless you got 10+ of the same exact weapon ur fine mate
---
6o clock! Time to do some chores..
---
Totally agree. I feel like there should be more options at the end of your match. Redo matchmaking solo, or redo matchmaking with your team.
---
I play with my fiance and when we do NW, we always have to go back and invite each other to the same team, then jump back in to the lobby. Like they don't even keep us teamed up (which I guess makes sense if you're playing with randoms). But there should be an option that just shoots us back in the game lol
---
No but i dont think that'll help
---
The water well (gold bullion) has the slowest animation. So you drink from it and mash l the collect bitton can produce like 400+ dirty water before the animation ends.

Im on xbox

I agree, I'm not a NW player - just played enough to get cosmetic unlocks. But the fact these NW challenges are making you do PVE activities in PVE is not well thought out. I would be pissed if I auto filled and my teammates ran off taking pictures and shooting AI units.  
---
They need to PVP activities, deal damage to players with explosives, deal 500 light arms damages, land 30 body shots on players, survive to the last 10 players etc There is plenty of design space to come up with pvp focused challenges.
---
It is a pain in the ass to do. But I do like getting the bonus 100 points for gaining EXP.
---
Congrats! you failed again. I look forward to ignoring your next reply.
---
Are there even turrets at foundation?
---
Tbh, I‚Äôd be hesitant to pass that information out, if I were them.
---
 CMs exist to help shield employees from the way people behave w/ the anonymity of the Internet.
---
I love the series, am frustrated with the path 76 has taken (played since BETA), but I‚Äôll walk away from the computer before I post ad hominem in all caps on Reddit
---
Don't forget the often slept on pipe rev√≥lver rifle.   That and the lever action are the best sniper rifles imo
---
Yep and that level 52 won‚Äôt be getting anywhere near the damage out of that weapon he should be. Build doesn‚Äôt come at level 52 and defo not at 20. Yep the dupe sucks but on the plus side caps flux and ammo just became relevant and all your mid to high tier trades gained value against the insane amount top tier had risen to
---
When I logged in on the first day of wastelanders there was some guy in front of my house and I talk to him and he said, "piss off we were here first" he did give me a magazine but he also insulted me so I moved.
---
He wasn't there first, I built my house there on the first day I played and never moved, but I was forced to.
---
I wish they would decouple Adventure Mode and Nuclear Winter. I am firmly in the camp of players who zero interest in Nuclear Winter.
---
lol are you sure he wasn't trying to bat the enemies around you or something? Seems really dumb on his part if that wasn't the case
---
JE gatling plasma with beam splitter says hi too :)
---
Tried the help articles, and of course nothing works. Pretty bummed.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs so gooood
---
I wish someone would dupe a weapon I gave a shit about...
---
Why else would Todd be so smug about admitting whole-heartedly that the initial release was garbage? He's said himself the the whole thing is sort of an experiment at something new. This game is not a priority to Bethesda as a whole in any way. Bottom line is it prints them money for other projects.
---
People are still charging a lot for them, and there is some good reasons. The dupe is not consistent and the weapons are still super good. But They shouldn‚Äôt be worth what they were before. I‚Äôd consider their value within max caps.
---
I didn't think about it, is so cute‚ô°. Is this a daily challenge for today?
---
I‚Äôm at 540hrs and i have 5 lvl 140 chars. Covid life is real üôÉüî´
---
Sadly for me this option isn't available to me. I have a 150g SSD, and it's mostly full.
---
Hahahaha if this is real this is great news. The game fails even harder, sounds impossible I know, and a much more competent company buys the IP.
---
Yes please Bethesda. Please make sure it actually takes 50,000 levels per 1% per perk card. Oh and then add in the cars into the Atom shop. We all know you love money more than life itself. So please sacrifice your young to stop that gene pool and make all the monies by charging $100 per perk card.
---
Please you grimy waste of carbon Todd, please bring these wishes to fruition.
---
I genuinely hope it happens.
---
But, in the short term, make it not take more than 1 character level per level of perk. So to get a maxed out Demolition Expert it should take no more than 5 levels.
---
This is reasonable as you have to double your build level to fully do so and that is fair.
---
I've still yet to even find someone with weapons like this.
---
A friend I play with has a bloodied gauss mini, and it‚Äôs amazing. About the same as a TSE flamer. Probably a little better.
---
They're definitely making dailies harder
---
Yes, that‚Äôs how I discovered this, someone bought something from me and it completed my S.C.O.R.E. Challenge, so I went to like 5 other C.A.M.P.S. To try and give some people some bonus S.C.O.R.E.
---
Repeating reply from identical post from another user:
---
 Considering this is only week 2 that may be a bit of a premature conclusion. I say we hold tight and see where it actually goes before losing our heads over the whole thing.
---
Bout tree fiddy.
---
What is a dupe?
---
Exactly, no problems leveling once per day in about 2 hours. Herbivore mutation, cranberry relish, brain fungus soup, unyielding armor, and building team. I'm sure that I can actually stack more buffs to do it even faster. I'm level 169 at the moment. I usually don't even have to make a special effort outside of my normal events and daily quest routine but if I'm in a time crunch, I'll clear out Westek and Huntersville.
---
Dang this is big if true. I've only heard the opposite - that it does not count towards your repeatable XP score. Unless they updated it
---
game credits feature EVERYONE that ever worked on the project.
---
it is quite frankly stupid to assume that‚Äôs the live team supporting the game
---
Can't think of any specific examples right now, but I've heard plenty of fucks in this game.
---
Sucks doesn't it...don't think you can swap the mod out either..
---
I have DP on my Torso and was considering buying the jetpack.  Thanks for the head's up!
---
Should be a daily and repeatable
---
A mentats could work wonderfully like this.
---
I found mine yesterday a generous soul on xbox had a 2 star instigating vats 33% for sale for 440 caps I couldn't believe it. I've been looking for one, for a year I can retire my quad vats 33% now
---
Yeah. It was annoying to repair. I just hopped on, made 10 police batons, smacked some mobs with them and repaired them all. That was the easiest route. First challenge I have had to go out of my way to do. I barely ever have to repair stuff.
---
I believe moving game file to sys drive helps, as oppose to D: or whatever :-)
---
Stands for duplication people are basically taking the rarest items in the game and creating two of them and it‚Äôs repeatable
---
Interviewer: We thank you for interviewing with us today. Do you have any questions for us?
---
Candidate: Yes. I was just wondering what title I would be assigned to?
---
Interviewer: One of our triple A online titles.
---
Candidate: Wow! ESO?
---
Interviewer: Fallout 76. Wait...where are you going?
---
You have to be off the game/servers at reset time or this happens, so just over an hr ago you were online and messed it up :-)
---
No of course not.  I'd be surprised if they've even played candy crush.  But that's even more reason why I'd love to see them struggle their way through it.
---
Ooh! Reverse psychology! Splendid idea.
---
Haha yeah it's like it spawns her at her meat chopping station, but when it's night time she goes to her bed.. so if you fast travel at night, she makes a beeline for bed from her spawn
---
This is for all our transgressions in breaking the market. We need to repent! Lol
---
Yes, if this was a trend we‚Äôd have 30 in week 10.üòÇüôà
---
Many curse words. Mostly fuck
---
Well that‚Äôs just it, I have god rolls on both melee and ranged but seeing people get it for nothing after I‚Äôve put the work in makes me, as well as others not want to put in the work anymore and just play something else. It‚Äôs not jealousy it‚Äôs principle
---
Maybe if you are in a team you should all buy a little something something
---
Dan was the best man at your wedding, godfather to your children.  Dan is now a puddle in the forest. What do you have to say about it?
---
"fuuuuuck"
---
This! I was really enjoying the game a lot and wondered why people complained so much about it. Then I hit end game a little while back, level 50 and finished main quest and wastelanders . Now I'm level 90 and I'm more and more trying to figure out something to do. I have 0 interest in time gated grinds so i don't even bother with that stuff. 
---
I like doing quests, exploring areas, clearing entire buildings of loot, fighting things. Now I'm to the point that  I dont really have any quests to do besides dailies. Most of my map is uncovered and I've been to most the interesting areas multiple times. I have so much junk now (aside from things like flux) its almost not even worth looting anymore. It's just sitting around with barely anything to use it on.
---
Its like while you're working towards level 50 everything is really well paced. You upgrade gear, level up, find new stuff often enough to keep things engaging. Then once you hit 50... it just stops. It's like you're really starting to sink your teeth in then its just kind of done. Some times I just find myself scrolling around the map in circles waiting for events to pop up cause there really isn't anything else for me to do. Maybe time to move on to a different game, which is unfortunate because this one has lots of potential.
---
Truth is in a year our characters are going to be woken up in game, without our inventories or camps and told it was all a simulation.
---
I only started doing NW for the daily S.C.O.R.E. and I skipped this one because in the past two weeks I've only killed 5 creatures.
---
All 5 Allies seem to draw from the same quest pool: find a weapon, go kill something, or go rescue someone. So the real deciding factors for which ally to have at your camp is a) which one is not glitching on the quest offerings, and b) which one annoys you the least with their chatter.
---
Could also be an alt character.
---
There is literally no reason why that would happen.
---
Who knows we might
---
I got 18 of one mounted plan from grinding the radio mole miner event. Most are 3-6. Not everything is duped.
---
I'll do it too then! Always happy to help other players
---
Ham-fisted attempt to make the 47th grind mechanic "more engaging^^^tm "
---
Edit- In all seriousness the numbers have gone up the last couple days but they've been no harder to seasoned players. Maybe it's different for lower levels which is probably not ideal honestly but I can't relate to that even though I know it must be annoying, and definitely isn't the way to go overall I think.
---
The repair one was kinda finicky because my luck is so high it's very rare to get a weapon etc that isn't over 100 percent, and I have so many repair kits from Queen farm that I can't recall the last time I actually used a workbench for it, but otherwise it was still like a half hour job for everything.
---
Yes, but fun is subjective I find Commando more fun.
---
Sounds like yer pretty bad at the game mate.
---
Bloodied this, bloodied that...boo-hoo, I have to use more than one shot on that ghoul...how will I get through the week...!!!!
---
High time you bloodied crew were launched out the game. A bunch of hopeless players who seem to need to one-shot any enemy or whine when you can't.
---
Half the enemies in Fallout SHOULD be a fvckin nightmare to deal with. A man/woman with a gun should struggle, should have to use his wits, tactics and have to plan how he/she'd cope with three Yao Gui or being ambushed by half a dozen radscorpions breaking out from under the ground.
---
Sick to death of seeing tonnes of things nerfed in this game while anyone who can't handle the challenge load up on rads, get themselves a basic bloodied gun and some unyielding armour and cakewalk the lot.
---
About time this style of play came with major setbacks too...
---
damn y‚Äôall I don‚Äôt even got 300 hrs and i‚Äôm around 250, don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good or bad ü§î
---
5 fusion cores
---
It means thanks for bringing that to our attention, but kindly f\*ck off.
---
True lol
---
You on about the vox syringer quest?
---
I hate posts like this; so accurate and well said but it's just other players out here reading and agreeing with it instead of any one from Bethesda. If Bethesda does read it though, you know they don't fuckin care.
---
It happens anyway without them, so not really an excuse, the problem actually was that the player would load in before the camp does so you would always be underneath foundations!
---
Chainsaw and Soiled Mr. Fuzzy or Tattered mole outfit work wonders.
---
Elder scrolls online doesn‚Äôt even have a gold cap so what gives?
---
FFS !!? 'I should be able to one hit everything'...listen to yerself.
---
Where's the point in that ?
---
You need to scrap it, if it's a supply crate :-)
---
Nothing will happen to you.
---
I ended up getting a weightless chest piece with endurance. Put my jet pack on that and then found my 3* Unyielding and modded that. Switch between them on spin wheel as i need a jetpack.
---
I'm level 460. I don't think the legendary perks taking alot to achieve is a bad thing. It gives players something to work for.
---
Yeah sometimes it's better to just take a game before you get really sick of it. There's a bunch of great games out there so there's always something!
---
that is not the only way this happens.
---
not to mention its fucking stupid to be blaming the player for this.
---
I do all of them
---
I get the daily scrip and test my luck
---
I do all the dailies
---
I do all of my score challenges
---
and afterwards i do events in the mire for the outfit and to level up
---
yep, have to force quit.
---
Well, here's hoping that the rest of the content slated for this year makes for a good enough game that public opinion can shift.
---
Yeah like adjusting the weight of an ammunition that (upon original design) wasn‚Äôt intended to be carried around in such large amounts, because those weapons didn‚Äôt exist. So simple! Glad you agree
---
It worked! Thank you
---
Not blaming you, I'm telling you that what likely happened in an amusing manner, chill out dude :-)
---
Sure, but a lot of them are.
---
Jim has a point, though.
---
There are companies out there who do this *so much better* than Bethesda does, and maybe they deserve your dollar more than the ones who are just dragging their feet.
---
I did not notice it. I agree that NW challenges increase can be annoying as it often requires to relog and wait for a new game to start. I tend to avoid NW then. 
---
But for adventure mode the difference between 4 or 10 is not significant enough for me. Ymmv of course
---
I'll do that sometimes when I'm gonna use vault76 for a stopoff point to somewhere else(still pretty low lvl myself so I do it to save caps).
---
I check first and see if any single digit lvl players are nearby and stop and try to give some spare water and stimpacks. I know that any spare weapons I have are too high lvl for them to use, so I drop what I struggled finding when I was new.
---
If I see a low level in an area they shouldn't be in nearby wherever I am going, I'll swing by and see if they need a hand.
---
I find it fun to help out other players, I normally don't play multiuser games so being in the world with other humans is a new thing for me.
---
That's awesome, especially at that level. It's not stupid to be excited over that. Hell, I still get excited taking down those damn Sheepsquatch.
---
This is near monogah power plant.
---
Dude is just hitman who is outsourcing his job. Either that or foundation has shit security.
---
Well it happened my photos are all gone
---
Sorry my heads glitched and is now on the floor /s
---
Workshops will give you lots of camp plans
---
A studio that focused on microtransactions and developing a free to play game... and it shows.
---
I have a bloodied heavy and a bloodied commando and I prefer the commando. 
---
Main reasons:
---
1.) I hate ‚Äúhaving‚Äù to be in PA for the armor piercing. PA landing stagger, slower speed, and just awkwardness are all big turn offs for me. 
---
2.) full set of unyielding is a hell of a drug. I hit every stat check, I can carry everything. It‚Äôs wonderful. 
---
3.) I like the feel of rifles more. It might be all in my head but I feel more accurate with a handmade than with a .50 
---
4.) commando is more ammo efficient usually.  I can burn 1k .50cal on a queen if the server doesn‚Äôt have good dps. 
---
I do think that my heavy gunner does better dps against a landed queen however and I can swap to shotguns, explosives or melee very easily with just a few perk swaps. So it‚Äôs not all downside.
---
Im sure this is not a PSA and is intact a bug of some kind. Gamepass and a physical copy use the same save file and game content.
---
\#16x the detail
---
I could see an alternative option of a small camp flagpole that MUST be placed on pre-existing world geometry, in addition to (eventually) putting the welcome mat back in.
---
Everytime I see these posts, it makes me more convinced that leaving the game was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
---
I have noticed recently that I still get legendary drops if I don't get a hit in (and that high level bloody builds are finally letting the rest of us get hits in on events like Uranium Fever). I don't know if they changed the rules or this is a bug, but they should change it.  On the other hand, I helped my friend do his first queen run a few days ago and neither of us got anything because someone shredded her the second she landed.
---
I'm fine with missing out on the xp, but losing legendary drops is frustrating. They should just remove the requirement that you get a hit in for loot on legendaries. It isn't like the odds of getting anything other than more to sell for scrip is very high anyway, and AFKing most of the events isn't that easy (also, who cares? Just make the game fun and not worry about it).
---
I get the complaints, but getting a great weapon legit is mainly RNG. Nothing to do with putting in a ton of work, it‚Äôs luck of the draw from the beginning. And just owning one, or someone else owning one, shouldn‚Äôt (and realistically doesn‚Äôt) effect your own gameplay in the slightest.
---
I just want to hug all the folks who‚Äôs feathers are ruffled so much by this that they come to complain about it on Reddit. Let it go. It‚Äôs okay. Change your goals from ‚Äúhaving the best weapon that no one else has‚Äù (which is RNG) to something like build a fantastic camp (that takes skill, patience, is rewarding, and gives you some camp plans to always work towards, can be admired by the community, can always be improved upon, etc.). This way no one can crush the game for you with an exploit and you can have endless fun with the game. Just one suggestion, but there are way more ways to play than just get the best weapon.
---
You're supposed to sell them to vendor npcs not players.
---
lol Maybe üòú
---
yeah, especially around legendaries if people arent being cool being in a group is jsut a negative.
---
Had that a number of time today in WS. Seen it on/off last few months all over the place, but definitely worse today...
---
The last statement is what I'm disagreeing with doh. To me it feels more designed like a MMO than any other Fallout. 
---
I'm still doing new shit on my fallout 4 character. My fallout 76 character has been repeating the same content for the last 50 hours.
---
I just got into the game myself, I have been a big big BIG fan of fallout 4 but was always a bit undecided on fo76 for all the negative response it got, but I recently got into a lot of videos and could not wait for the steam summer sale to get the game, needless to say I have been tremendously enjoying myself!  
---
To the point: This reminds me of my first interaction with someone in the game haha
---
I just started to set up at Sunshine Meadows after i stumbled upon it when I somewhat aimlessly looked around the map and it gave me the pop up that people might try to pvp me to take over the workshop, so when a lvl 150+ suddenly appeared and sheared down all the ghouls AND seeked me out I was scared shitless and tried to hide xD  
---
But when I couldn't escape they started emoting and then giving me a truckload of purified water, radaway and other stuff and it was such a godsent.
---
There have been a few other times where people gave me stuff and it always makes me so happy, gives me little fuzzy feeling how nice the people of fo76 are, its exactly how I hoped the game would be, basically fo4 but meeting nice people here and there, it's perfect, it feels so alive ;u;
---
Just trying to make sure it doesnt happen again
---
Why should you get the same items when you buy only one month when I paid for all of the months?  That‚Äôs not good business sense
---
At this point I just drop legendaries at train station
---
&gt; you were online and messed it up
---
sounds accusatory but ok
---
Everyone? I don‚Äôt have shit, and I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of others that don‚Äôt either.
---
I'm pretty sure the last time a game broke for me when I installed in on a separate drive was in the 1990s (and I've installed hundreds of games on separate drives). It's no surprise that it is was Fallout 76 which broke the streak and failed at something so basic. I guess they're just keeping up with the Fallout 76 tradition.
---
My friend and I are about to do the heist and I can't decide whether to focus on getting the ammo factory or keep the gold for buying SS armor. Then I remembered that I'm going to have to spend hundreds of hours beyond the heist listening to Rocksy go on about loyalty to get the full SS set, and that made up my mind pretty quick.
---
Cranberry relish, runs thru super mutant/ghoul areas like West Tek and the Underground
---
Well, not everyone - but the past 3 days or so, quite a few.
---
But you also omitted the smiley face, that conveys light heartedness...... :-) see
---
Its actually probably suffering on both accounts because they tried to mix it up without enough through, it seems.
---
I think they create a new one because of that popup that a new team is formed, for publicity
---
For the past week and a half whilst leveling up my new character, ive had it several times
---
Ive also reinstalled it three times and verified the files well over 20 times and got nothing
---
This game really doesn't need any more reputation hits.
---
Always ask for the authenticity certificate when you buy a weapon.
---
There should be a plan for placeable spawns within your camp. That would be nifty.
---
I had a low level player at my camp yesterday. I crafted a suppressed rifle, and then gave the gift emote. The person stayed until i dropped a paper bag with the rifle, some stimpacks, ammo, and other random gear. Then they ran off without looking at the paper bag. Oh well.
---
Yeah, they could make it a proximity thing, like they have with other issues.
---
Personally while the duped weapons are an irritating factor in the game at the moment I don‚Äôt want to see bethesda bother putting any effort into dealing with them at all at the moment.
---
I‚Äôd rather that they try to get the game stabilized and try their best to prevent further duping.  That way as the game progresses and 4* and eventually 5* legendaries become a thing all these 3* ones will become a thing of the past and hopefully just remembered as growing pains.
---
That stuff is all server side, nothing you can do your end :-)
---
It is hard considering not many people have microphones
---
AAE gat plasma?
---
I do get your point about one-shots though. It was bad before, but now...
---
sleep, path to enlightenment and food buffs
---
also teaming.. if youre into that
---
kill as many mobs of the highest level you can easily wipe out as you can find and go to events that throw tons of mobs at you
---
-ETA: if you see someone selling cheap leader bobbleheads.. buy and use those too
---
Funny that everytime there's a good comment about fallout bethesda always manages to comment on it but when it's a criticism you can hear the crickets chirping
---
They can also report on what happened after they passed things along. If the devs decided not to act on it until other issues were fixed, we can be told this.
---
I can agree with that. Definitely feels like a Frankenstein's monster of a game.
---
yeah I have to say I've played more NW since the legendary run came out, but I don't like NW that much and I really don't like searching for creatures to kill. takes forever.
---
Well no that wasn't the case. I would've given him the benefit of the doubt if l thought it was accidental but he ran right up to me while my back was turned and took like 3 swings at me. So first I hit him with my crossbow as a warning shot and then he proceeds to bob and weave to avoid that and still swing on me. So that's when I pull out the shotgun and destroy him with it.
---
idm, he wants to know, if he knows he can build to it.
---
Get the mutations that provide +INT, get +INT on your gear if possible.
---
That‚Äôs why I keep a crappy legendary 10mm on my character. I really try to not be that guy.
---
At this point you should just play something else. Come back for double xp weekends and new seasonal content. There's probably a lot more things you can do which are more rewarding.
---
Meat Week Stein! Can‚Äôt wait to add it to the collection
---
I almost wonder if there isn't some proximity going into the calculation, because I have gotten lucky and gotten the drop even when I know I didn't hit the enemy.
---
Do you recommend priming the mini gun?
---
Need a screenshot of when it dropped before o buy
---
If you're getting the jetpack, find yourself 2 pieces of armor that have 50% Fall Damage Reduction on them, [for your health!](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/25959365/for-your-health.jpg)
---
Absolutely! Try a bloodied or instigating Gauss shotgun. You will one-shot most things except bullet sponges, of course. Even the SBQ hates the Gauss shotty üòÅ
---
Much like the perk cards, 90% of legendaries aren't :-)
---
Its annoying, as my usual route is to farm whitespring for 2-3 legendaries and a wendigo as vengance
---
Then west tec which gives 1-2 usually
---
Then if any events are on o go do those, but it's pointless when i cant loot anything
---
Btw have you encountered an annoying bug where you load into the game and your objectives dont load at all for a solid 10-20 minutes and you travel to an event and the markers dont show up
---
That's the way to do it, especially if you are having explosive weapon, you need dense.
---
Took me three matches to even see three creatures for this daily a few days ago.  So I didn't even try to complete the nine creatures one yesterday.
---
Become an egghead!  One of us! one of us! one of us!
---
I stopped going to whitesprings months ago because of this issue.  I also had legendary ghouls disappear after killing them.  Must be performing as intended by the developers.
---
yeah agree. it's bullshit. creatures are hard enough to find, let alone kill before you get whacked by another player. I tried a few rounds last night and gave up because I couldn't find enough creatures.
---
Mutate ... :)
---
Seriously, I originally thought my genes are gonna stay pure, but now I have like 6. Egg Head comes to mind when it comes to XP gains. Bird bones for sneak, speed demon, marsupial (everyone has marsupial, come on :))... 
---
Ofc paired with Starched Genes and Class Freak .... If you didn't plan for it you lose a few points to Luck but seriously gain so much out of it back...
---
I think many people use broken armor so they can still get the legendary effects off it and not crush their damage..
---
Lost a couple legendaries to water in heart of the swamp.
---
Yep, also finished Rad Rumble the other day and it just stopped, no rewards, no pop ups, just stopped.
---
Was like..."great" then about 10 mins later the visual fanfare popped up and I got my rewards and notes etc....
---
Would love the option to put other tags on a group: talking encouraged, working together, etc
---
The sentry bots and assualtrons at whitesprings give plenty of xp and you can most likely one-shot the sentrys if you hit them in the cores.
---
Have em all besides egg head... What's the negative of that?
---
I'm 1 day into and a level 3 myself funny enough and really enjoying it. I've been knee deep into rdo for last 6 months so this is a great change of pace with surprisingly a few similarities which I was really happy about. The beauty of the world's is one of them and exploration (76 taking it to another level). Long time fallout fan but was always not sure about 76. Now give me some freebies because I'm a peasant compared to a lot of you 100+ers and need to survive lol.
---
SeaDaddyGaming on Xbox is up to, like, 1853 I think. I watch Rifle Gaming and they team up sometimes. I think he got it from an exploit.
---
Pretty much what this guy said you have to have zero dr
---
Best method is to have a higher level player craft them for you, plus that way they can mod them out too. I craft (and sell) PA to help out the community, one of my vendors is always stocked with Calibrated shock PA legs (Ultracite, X01, Excavator) as well as Jetpack and protocol torsos plus helm etc. if you're on PS4 hit me up, I know all of the craftable PA plans PSN matches my Reddit ID
---
I even tried it with various weapons, they don't even stand up when i jump on them without stealth
---
The deathclaw at level 91 just walked around me, a level 51 and did nothing whilst i killed it in three hits
---
I came back to the game because i wanted to see if anything had improved, and honestly it hasnt, it took 3 hours roughly to do the wastelanders expansion solo, and the main campaign getting to the enclave took me about 11-12 hours
---
So I guess playing Alts is out the window if you want to lvl up these perk cards.
---
It's not a competition.
---
You lose some strength.

That isn't a problem with switching from the disc to games pass. It is just a different licence. Your save game is still there. It is another issue.
---
Great question. You make significantly more ultracite 2mm per craft than regular 2mm, but Ultracite 2mm obviously costs flux. If you can afford the flux cost for the ammo, prime it
---
It‚Äôs not because of the weapon. It‚Äôs because of the unyielding sets.. when you die the game resets your health above the amount required to get +3 to your stats. Therefore, with a full set of unyielding you‚Äôll loose 5 strength points, sometimes enough to get you over-encumbered.
---
I spend my time getting into the role of my character, hoarding pretty much everything I can, finding rare drops to display in my trophy toom, hunting mothmen, and just generally finding out the quickest way to turn even the strongest of beasts into a gore pile with a wide collection of weapons. (And of course, the tried and true Appalachian tradition of trying to find space in your camp and stash)
---
Personally this is why I like fallout 76. You, for the most part, aren't always obligated to be some war hero. At the end of the day you get to chose how you live your unhinged life in this wasteland of ours. I may be some jack of all trades hoarder that punches things 3 times my size with a mechanical fist, but next to me could be some outfit collector, a BoS roleplayer, or a guy in a sheepsquatch outfit continuously spinning in circles. 
---
Flawed as it can be sometimes, there is a reason this game keeps me coming back. It's something that can be enjoyed by a variety of people for a variety of reasons and if I so please I can help them right along that journey.
---
My cranberry relish and canned meat aren't stacking atm
---
I'm not a vet and I do play the game a lot, but I don't tell people how to play cause thats the joy of gaming. Would I like them to move NW score to something else? Sure If I want BR I play Apex. Does it bother me? Nah, it's one whole challenge a day I can't expect a game made to appeal to a large player base to just cater to me and the point of a battle pass season is to grind, since I'm grinding one on another game and it's finally getting close to done. I even paid extra for the "premium" pass so that the grind wasn't as bad, but then someone would screech how I'm "wrong with what's gaming today" and I just view it as "Well it's my money and my hobbies....sooooo"
---
Yeah that doesn't make sense. If your going to be making ammo and stuff go with building, you will get more xp from everything you make that way.
---
I modded this a bit so anyone could save a copy and put in their daily earnings to get a better estimate of where they might be at the end of the road. You can enter the amount of SCORE you typically earn each day/week on the right (for instance, I don't usually do any of the NW ones) and it will update the levels, and list how many atoms you need to complete 100 at the bottom. It also takes into account the double weekends by doubling the daily SCORE and doubling the repeatable xp earnings for their respective weekends.

\+6 INT
---
\-3 END and STR (&lt;-1 with class freak)
---
Shit they might as well go the distance and make it a weekly challenge while they're at it so we miss 1000 SCORE and have to spend 1500 Atoms or grind 100,000 xp to make it up!
---
I'm sure the players would love it if that happened!
---
Farming gold bullion for the SS armor is a long grind for sure. But I'd like to think its worth it. The SS armor has almost as much ballistic resistance as PA and we can keep our backpacks and use all weapons
---
Completely understand. I scrip by weight. Take weight reduction perks off, sort by weight, scrip.
---
I didn't downvote you but upvote to counter the cowards who downvote without giving a reason
---
Valley Galleria has a bunch of cars to explode.
---
I've definitely noticed this is a nicer community compared to a lot of other games that can be potentially PvP.  Generosity is definitely appreciated!
---
\+8 INT FTW
---
I can only get so many rolling pins.
---
1000 hours and I'm lvl 221. I love fallout but I will quit playing this game before I'm level 1500
---
Free fast travel for people to come shopping at your camp.
---
As for currency caps Im guessing it just a variable, and to avoid you going over its limit they put a cap. For example, ammo points were most likely int variables. They have a size of 2047 so they cut it down to 2000.
---
\+8 INT - str -1 end
---
I‚Äôve played 2632 hours and I‚Äôm at 526. I play about 6 hours a day so I know there are people that play more or less. I would consider I play at least an average amount so it would take me about another 5200 hours to max one perk. That kind of makes me puke in my mouth a little.
---
well. try going back to disc
---
Something needs to happen.  Some people like playing multiple chars.  Imagine doin this grind more than once.
---
I have two characters in the 150 range. I'm already bored as hell. There's no way I'm making it to 500 much less 1500. There's just not enough content.
---
I keep getting dailies and challenges complete out of nowhere for me
---
Or i go to an event showing nobody else there, get inside and there is about 7-8 invisible players killing the whole room with one shot
---
Did you hear a sound when that happened?  
---
Did the enemies have a star ? (Legendary?)
---
Legendary enemies have a chance to "mutate" when down below 50%HP (once), healing back to full.
---
You're not alone, I have had many Noctunal and even worse Stalkers rolling pins. The only "comedy" legendary I want I cant get, that being a shovel, for the amusing noise :-)
---
I share sun kissed when I see that no one has extreme rads on. I share photosynthetic when people aren't topped off then switch to something else.
---
Dude are you dumb or something????? Bloodied and explosive has been in the game before the nerf actually im sure its been in the game since launch at that time bloody wasn't good everyone wanted TSE and also if they are hacked then how tf are they on console???? Because news flash you can't hack on console
---
You are so cute and nice, I really like that you trying to help others with the score. Add me in game if you want to help me out üòÖ
---

---
Safe to say Ward is not quite popular.
---
Or they could just put the gear in my inventory
---
It‚Äôs called Someone to Talk To originally.
---
Here‚Äôs the [wiki guide](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Someone_to_Talk_To) for reference!
---
Like I said, you could offer the items at a discounted price to those who missed the free stuff.. that way no one loses out?
---
With that logic, why should 1st members be funding 76 while those who paid ¬£15 for the game get access to the legendary run? Just a thought...
---
Hey, another settlement needs "our" help...
---
I'd agree  with this. I still find myself in FO single-player mode half the time.
---
Maybe it's just the Bloodied asshats who can't actually play the game unless they have their cosy wee protective one-shot world. Now they aren't happy with that they've got to ruin your day too...
---
I appreciate guys like you OP. I was given a couple of maxed out guns and armour at  a low level and just having stuff like a long scope and half ultra-light, half deep-pocketed armour made a huge difference.
---
You're doing Gods work. There should be a facility on the vendors to level lock items so new players can buy nice stuff from good guys like yourself.
---
This, but normal ones can glitch out and regenerate at times
---
In that case, I would like a bloodied faster fire rate .50cal and gatling gun, please, will pay 25 concrete scrap, each.
---
Love that idea. Purchase history would make that thing WAY more useful. Cause then you could look at the data and see what people are actually buying!
---
*a new contestant has arrived*
---
What the heck might even throw in 10 purified waters, I ain't that cheap!
---
If I could recruit him for my C.A.M.P. I would make sure he'd work on the damn Ammo Converter 24/7
---
They are doing it because it‚Äôs a proven tactic
---
This is before pandemics: look at their history. 
---
Morrowind- buggy as hell still
---
Oblivion- buggy as hell still
---
Fallout 3- buggy as hell still
---
Skyrim- buggy as hell still
---
Fallout 4- started off really stable! Now, buggy as hell from DLC and gets worse with every Creation Club Content. 
---
Skyrim Special Edition- Still buggy but pretty stable compared to other Skyrim. 
---
Fallout 76- really buggy as hell still. Enough to where it makes me question what goes on over there. 
---
Conclusion: 
---
Bethesda has a serious problem patching their games. F76 is treated like a single player game- Lack of meaningful content, patches are maybe once every two or so months if lucky, feeling of slowly that support by developers is trickling down. 
---
I love that they wanted to experiment, but hate they won‚Äôt fully commit to a MMO.
---
45 min a day is not a small ammount, especially with no banking.
---
I believe it‚Äôs 5% more per hit, up to 50. I could be wrong and would like it if someone corrected me.
---
In my experience it's not a huge difference, the base damage goes up a small amount on each consecutive hit. If you miss it resets. You're gonna have to make the decision for yourself if it's worth it.
---
I have been playing since the beta... I have almost 1k hours on this game (700 I think) and no im pretty sure that hacks don't work on console and 99% of the people on console
---
It stacks on each hit for 5% damage. Up to a maximum of 9 hits I think. But it resets if you hit another enemy. Which happens quite a bit with explosive weapons. And the SBQ is immune to explosive damage. Something like an Anti Armor faster fire rate is much better for the SBQ IMO.
---
Oh, well I usually reach that cap by selling cooked food I don't use before it goes bad. Good to know though.
---
Herd mentality mutation?  Plus all the other charisma perks I don‚Äôt want to switch out.  So mostly laziness on my part
---
1500 5 characters and still love it.  I don‚Äôt sweat the bugs just work around them as overall you can do a lot.  Early game is fun as every situation can get tough fast, but I still die when over run by ghouls if I don‚Äôt approach a situation right.
---
K love it when they do a chain reaction. I allways jump a bit from my chair
---
when they make limits like this, they are saying "this is a bonus for cheaters, normal players just shouldnt bother"
---
Xbox doesn't have a separate location for the screenshots - pics you've taken? I can delete all my pics in the game and they are all saved in the capture gallery. There are even Fallout 4 pics on mine and random shots because I hit the wrong buttons.
---
It's 1500 for 6 (I think?), not one. Still insane if you ask me.
---
In b4 the no lifers comment on how the system isn't meant for "casual" players. 
---
Btw I agree with everything you said. This game is beyond a total mess and its sad to see. üòî
---
It‚Äôs good to get team bonuses quickly as people tend to join event teams the most (at least on Xbox with my experience). They really should be capitalizing on Building since INT bonuses but I guess some people can‚Äôt figure that out.
---
I didn't know about the reset.  That's unfortunate (but makes sense).  Ya, I'm going to have to experiment.  She is a pain to hit while flying and a sitting duck on the ground.
---
Thank you!
---
People are jumping to conclusions with the current perk coin system. It‚Äôs clearly a work in progress, there‚Äôs no way the current values will stay. Looking at what‚Äôs on the PTS right now, it‚Äôs obvious that the focus for the last few weeks was making new perk cards, the new ones don‚Äôt even have artwork yet. 
---
It does need attention, but there seems to be an assumption that it‚Äôs already in its final form when it clearly isn‚Äôt.
---
I think what several other people here have said, most of the Griefers got bored and left quite awhile ago, but yea, a few diehards are still around. I'll occasionally run in to help someone defend their workshop and pick up some Exp. and I've noticed some are pretty gun shy. If so I keep my distance and face away from them when possible so they don't freak out. I'll drop some stuff, and usually before I start out playing, sometimes I'll drop by the overseer camp and drop stuff into the stash box there. It's a game and I play it to have fun and have mindless entertainment.
---
I have exactly 1214 hours played in this game (you can check by going to challenges, character, explore Appalachia for 7600 hours). And im only level 387. I literally play this game atleast 2-3 hours everyday, and dont even come close to upgrading 1 or 2 perk cards to max.
---
They do have poor communications. I will give you that.
---
Not true at all anymore. I was at work till 3pm. Well past the 12 pm reset. I lost two dailies.
---
Hell I did my first sbq at 9 sure I didn't get drop from queen but big exp boost from her and mobs and still got completion rewards. Plus that's kinda the reason I wish I could drop them
---
Why is it that the bugginess of previous games isn't an issue for anyone but suddenly the bugs in this game are a symbol of the cash grab it is and how bad they are now.
---
The game is just as playable in it's current state as other Fallout games if not moreso. You will all praise Fallout NV but it's more of a buggy mess than anything Bethesda has put out.
---
Not everyone gives a shit to constantly level up. Some people enjoy other aspects of the game, like building/renovating their camp or gathering resources. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs sad to see the high score players when there is literally no chance they could have gotten the level and Bethesda doing jack shit
---
Wait are you telling me that the western outfit is rare
---
Why stay at 100 make it 1000 and 10 different vehicle bonus challenge no ya talking
---
Oddly it's up to 45%/9 stacks, not 50%/10 stacks
---
Yep.
---
lol f in the chat for foundation
---
it's not about them doing the events, but about the ones who join and do events for them
---
I noticed the slight increase as well and it's not that bad for adventure as I could complete those way too quick last week. But I'm a bit on the fence regarding NW and killing 9 critters or using 6 stims is too much playing NW in a day for me. 
---
I don't think I should be able to get every last bit of SCORE if my playtime is somewhat limited. But it shouldn't require absolutly crazy amount of time each day to complete relatively simple dailies.
---
The NW weekly was a step in the right direction of rewarding some extra score for those of us that bothered to play some extra NW whilst still not making it a way to bypass the grind. Though I don't think upping the bar for the daily challenges (and especially the NW) is a right course of action.
---
We're still early in this season though, so let's see if it gets better or worse as the season goes on.
---
If its a type of armor I dont have all the mods for, and its cheap Ill buy it just for a shot at the mods, and if the camp is in the forest, I assume I'm helping a lowbie
---
That's the dedication of our fellow Raiders to our cause.
---
Where are you getting your info?
---
Come on to fvck. Who is buy a pepperonni roll off you for 4k ???
---
I can't even sell a full Treasure Hunter outfit for 2k...they haven't moved in two weeks.
---
I was too until my dailies started auto completing and Bethesda said they can‚Äôt do anything.
---
oof soory to hear dude
---
I enjoy both these modes very much ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The issue isn‚Äôt how to punish them, it‚Äôs that they aren‚Äôt being caught in the first place.
---
the xtra rr is nice though, can walk in water and fairly close to radiated containers without tick. And have extra dr er. Know how you feel but try it
---
I prefer the general XP bonus from Building teams, too, since I tend to just derp around in game, but if there is no Building team available, I‚Äôll join an Events team as a second priority if I make the fourth player, to maximize Strange in Numbers as well as the occasional event that I do even while derping.
---
Yeah, visit someone's cam, buy a single bullet for 1 cap, BING! Both get a bonus.
---
It's the happiest of all challenges and I support it immensely.
---
It‚Äôs the basement floor of that building in pleasant valley with the vendor. The same room that rose‚Äôs quest wraps up
---
Pipe? Really?
---
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.  
---
I personally have not experienced this.
---
I‚Äôve only been playing few weeks. Started with a friend during Xbox free play weekend. We then found game at BJs (like Costco) for $10. I now have alternate character since my friend can‚Äôt play as much. Still under level 50 on both, but I‚Äôve played this more than any other Fallout game. If you think things are bad here, go check out the Red Dead Online subreddit. That game is full of bugs and no updates in months.
---
This is literally the saltiest sub I follow. I think it's because at least half the ppl are the original 76 haters who just never bothered to leave.
---
What‚Äôs this 1500 all about?
---
well put... i had to skip 2 days of nw challenges... on week days i have limited time to play. just 2 hours or so... no way i'll spend one fighting with others for the same container to unlock or beast to kill. survive 30 minutes was at least fun and like you said, it does fit with NW gameplay.
---
I don't have enough space there :|
---
If you cannot do it then you cannot do it.
---
If people knew that there even is a slight chance of having to part with their sweet money to continue playing, im 100% at least some people would think thrice about foing it
---
I‚Äôve scrapped like 30+ and given away more. That‚Äôs so much lost in trades
---
It‚Äôs common bug unfortunately with other players, and I don‚Äôt think you can get those SCORE points back
---
Someone who thinks its a rare drop from Riding Shotgun
---
wdym
---
so far the only change Bethesda has said is happening to the system is. that animated cards are now only worth 1 instead of 5. due to complaints of people not wanting to be forced to use those over others. so until they say they have changed it its still 1 point per card per star on the card. .
---
Okay tiger.
---
Yeah that's true. There's very little I actualyl want so I'll finish it at some point as otherwise bullion is just gonna sit and do nothing in my inventory.
---
Or just perm ban them... the first time
---
I think you're actually right.  I can't edit title, but will put a note at the top.  And you're correct that it's STILL AN INSANE ASK
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be an achievement. Not everyone is supposed to be able to complete it. 
---
Also not ‚Äúridiculously hard‚Äù.
---
Going to have to disagree here a bit.  I don't think things should be balanced around the players who play the least amount.  Yes, level 1500 is a lot, and most of us won't reach it.  It could stand to be cut down a bit.  But as it is, that's okay to me.  I'm fine with slowly working on it over time and having something to work towards.  The game can't be balanced around those players who play every few days and take long breaks when there are tons of people who play every day, ESPECIALLY when it's something that is not really a necessary thing.  It's not like you are locked out of content you can't do.  And, for the record, I say that as someone with a full time job, family, other hobbies, and whatever else you want to qualify it with :)
---
How did you get so many?
---
I only log in and do the settlers daily and davenport ones to work on my rep, then knockout queen of the hunt, and wastenot (my camp is in the northern mirel
---
Yeah the damage boosts on some of these legendary effects are just oof. Add in the duping and double oof.
---
downvote me even tho i‚Äôm right üòò
---
It‚Äôs been said before, but you don‚Äôt need everything. 
---
Here‚Äôs a suggestion for a possible compromise: future seasons have some of the higher rank rewards as lower ranks rewards, but as an option. 
---
For example: in Season 2, when you reach rank 50, you can get the Season 1 Rank 95 reward **OR** you can get the Season 2 Rank 50 award. One or the other. Not both. If you missed out on it before, you can get it this time, but you‚Äôll have to choose to miss out on the new one.
---
I left New Vegas out as Obsidian developed it, but I agree with how buggy it is. Even now it‚Äôs pretty bad. I was going to compare the two but decided not to as many would comment that Beth didn‚Äôt make it. 
---
I demonstrated the past as a somewhat buggy game is normal for Beth, but the state of it now is pretty bad still. Nearly 2 years after release! 
---
If the game had no bugs I‚Äôd be worried üòÇ I‚Äôm ok with some bugs; but crashing a lot, weapons disappearing, cutting content to deal with dupes for weeks, took out the Vaults as players would do them due to the horrendous lag. They could‚Äôve converted it for a dungeon, nope just cut cut cut.
---
Hahahahaha
---
i can go get fortnite and the battle pass and grind it a million times easier than this
---
Who knows maybe they'll add it with the brotherhood update coming soon (hopefully)
---
That is the single worst challenge so far. I would rather see a challenge be get in the top 10 or 5 teams and be forced to try my best. But nope, ru  around for hours looking for npc. Smh
---
I wish they had the fast travel rug from fallout 4, it made it so wherever you placed the rug that‚Äôs where you would spawn and I wish they added it into 76 but alas they did not
---
My bad. Spell checker (Grammarly) didn't work. I probably depend on it too much? lol
---
this game is made for people that play everday i would play everday if the grind wasnt that hard
---
Duh?
---
And here I got Allied with Foundation before getting blown up by a nuke
---
It‚Äôs not meant for everyone to complete. It‚Äôs also not a Participation Ribbon haha.
---
You get that benefit from any Public Team, not just events. Even if you‚Äôre in the team solo.
---
That‚Äôs fun idea but the last thing I need is another goddamn holotape cluttering my inventory..
---
I spent 900 scrip immediately, then realized that I don't have the inventory to carry all of that.  I'm still stuck in that store haha.  I wish the legendary mods were less.  But yeah, I would like 75 scrip as the going rate.  99% of what you roll is junk.
---
The note ‚Äúyour the dumbass‚Äù
---
Totally. Go nuts and see what happens man.
---
I didn't know that story bosses can mutate. Also, can robots mutate? The Crater quest with Ra-Ra (final robot boss) also regenerated to full HP after I crit it from stealth.
---
No, I hear no special sound and I don't see the message "Legendary enemy has mutated". It just happens but only to tougher enemies, I think.  Do diseased enemies also count as legendary and can also mutate?
---
Perhaps I'd have to record it next time?
---
I'm seeing this also. VATs locked, BOOM, nothing. Also, I've been having problems in events with lots of people where I'm hitting the VATs button like crazy and it's not doing anything, even though my meter is full. It seemed to be working fine before this weeks update. Ah well...
---
They had to take it out due to all the griefers from what I understand.
---
My camp is near Foundation and I'm cheap and lazy.
---
they will unlock cheat-codes to speed up the process in a few more days, they will be the 16 digits on your credit card, the 3 digit security code, and the expiration date. alternatively your paypal login would work if you have it set up before-hand
---
if they looked up for 1 sec to look at ESO they could see a proper system for prestige levels... all cards should be unlocked at latest by 500, but 300 would be way more reasonable for the average player and then it's still a grind! Just a grind expected by a MMO
---
It requires less than an hour a day to complete the daily challenges. Sometimes leas than 30 minutes. 
---
Some players have already completed the board. 
---
Again, you don‚Äôt need to complete the board. Just get as far as you can. You‚Äôll get cool stuff regardless.
---
I feel like perm banning people for lets say, duplicating a nocturnal shovel and scripping it is a bit too much. But it depends on the severity of the offense
---
If you talk to him he'll tell you he has a shady past. Hes just pretending to be a settler
---
I just like killing ghouls and the tickets started racking up. I did rose‚Äôs questline and I forgot about the bellhop for a week or 2. Then when I remembered about him I had a lot of tickets to turn in
---
He‚Äôs asking how to level and get plans as a *new player*. He‚Äôs likely in the level 2-25 range right now, with 25 being a high estimate. Getting even a good *partial* set of unyielding at his level would be very, very hard.
---
I was wondering about that, thank you
---
Basically, you aren‚Äôt entitled to the rewards. Nor am I.  No one is.  If you can‚Äôt earn the rewards, that‚Äôs it.
---
i make the team for me and my friend. if you want to join go ahead. if you want to leave go ahead. the added xp boost helps him. no where in it does it say i have to do events non stop for 20 hours. i do the ones we want to do and when those are not available. we clean inventory, sell items, make bullets and do dailies. then when one we like pops up we go. you're not forced to be in our party. feel free to leave at any time. or make your own and have your own rules for it. but we focus on public events that grant treasury notes.
---
when you are stacking furious along with crits, sneak, bloody mess, gun-fu and adrenaline(when it works) it is a beast
---
Ahh, makes sense
---
Low level raiders (various) seem to take a lot more than their level suggests and can dish out a lot more.
---
i dont have money nor time to play it like the way they want
---
Depends on the weapon. My furious napalmer melts enemies pretty fast.
---
I already had one, but instead of letting me login, it made me create one. So I guess I have a new one, with the same email address? wtf.
---
This is an interesting idea and surely would still piss a lot of people off haha
---
Then do that.
---
Not the experience I've had, I get jumped by bloatflys quite a lot
---
Yes...? All big companies do. They literally have positions for doing just that. People are paid very big money to collect and interpret large amounts of data from their customers. If you don't mind me asking...how did you think it worked beforehand?
---
Deep Pocketed and Dense won't stack with the Jetpack. Buttressed will though for what it's worth.
---
It‚Äôs meant to be LEGENDARY not common. It‚Äôs not a damn participation ribbon. It‚Äôs meant to be extremely difficult.
---
Lol at being upset that content is drying up after 175+ hours of game play. 
---
I did 6 run throughs of outer world's, The FALLOUT KILLER lol. And didn't hit that mark. Also a completionist.
---
Still running around with my 1* bloodied handmade wondering where all the dupes are. I honestly have not seen a single dupe this cycle in a Npc or player vendor on pc.
---
Yes I can see how build ten things, kill one level dart or even eat food is a hard grind.
---
As you describe it, I'm a bit of a biohacker and a bit of a builder. Always looking for new and sometimes weird ways to play the game. I spend a lot of time finding weapons and trying to make builds for them, and when I find something really exciting, I try to make it in the game.
---
I also find it fun to theme my characters and camps to their builds. One of my characters is a cannibal junkie cult leader who hides his cult activities in a church and seemingly inviting house. Half of the house seems inaccessible, I should trap that side for kicks.
---
Even though the dr numbers are close PA still has an added 45% dmg resistance that isnt stated anywhere.
---
The raiders are the lesser of two evils. Meg welcomes ghouls (and super mutants!) with open arms but Paige needs to be warned that an incredibly awesome ghoul is coming to help Foundation out so she wont get shot. Foundation is full of lying scumbags like Samuel who looted a Vault Tec gift shop and never set foot in a vault, but Crater has people who are up front about their underhanded ways. Even Jen hides the truth about her parents.
---
Not to mention Ward who gives you a quest with literally no other option than to kill someone to retrieve an item they have too many of already. Ward is still a raider imo.
---
misses do not reset the stack unless you hit another target..
---
there is a 10 second timer you have to stay ahead of
---
i feel intimidated by the battle pass i dont want to try putting a bunch of time into something i cant complete
---
Ya, I think I'll be letting this gatling gun go.  Had a feeling there was something not quite right about it.
---
I'll be on the lookout for AA heavy weapons.  Thanks!
---
the t-65 has sick stats from what i can see. only got the chest so far, but only that wa musch better than the x-01. Yeah it stinks. Think its okay with a new currency, just not capped like they do
---
The real reason was probably because people could 3 star an animated card with non animated ones.  That seems to be gone now, too.  I tried to merge a two star animated card with a 1 star regular card yesterday and could not.
---
I just wish there were more quests that gave reserve notes. I'd not mind if you could grind with more variety. You'd still be limited by the billion limit (also unnecessary nonsense), but at least I wouldn't be tempted to test the limits of the essential tag every time I get stuck mashing E over Rocksy and Wren
---
Is that because of fast fire rate or flamers are just that good now?
---
I have about 250 hours and I really enjoyed early game/Wastelanders storyline as I explored Appalachia and all the horrors along the journey. I, for one, enjoy the Settlers and Raiders dynamic and thought it would be more fleshed out after the main story line.
---
I agree the game needs a lot of work for sure. I just feel like the majority of complaints aside from "No NPCs at launch" and other very debatable things have come up in the last few months which lines up with the pandemic, and I feel like the conditions of the pandemic resulted in a lot of the issues people are complaining about, which is why I personally want to cut some slack. 
---
I've had my fair share of criticism since launch but have also been generally lax as someone who has enjoyed it as well.
---
I'm all good demanding answers from the devs, and what you call out if fair. But why would they want to share any answers to a passive aggressive post?
---
Tried it this morning and worked like a charm, thanks mate!
---
Typical blame shift
---
The response on my ticket says they will not do anything. Real nice.
---
I think of it as a nice Atoms boost if you were considering buying some anyways.
---
hang on i am just going to remake the thread with a more accurate title, i don't want to spread misinformation
---
Run of the mill trash mobsand queen fights the 2mm pvp and big baddies that will keep distance the Gat
---
Then don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude but people want everything given with little work (I‚Äôm not saying this is your example but many people are bitching a lot)...that‚Äôs why fasnacht sucked this year lol.
---
yea i understand but its been said if you played everyday to do all dailies youll only get to 95 and i dont got enough money to pay like the way they want
---
No and there never will be any if Ward keeps "losing" those targeting cards.
---
Heroes and villains was good until lando could glitch his power blast and stunlock/ three shot kill any villian in the game. And what's worse is they never fixed it.
---
I'll say I've not played a ton just yet, only a couple of hours but I'm actually pretty impressed so far. I'm liking the writing and voice acting of the first few NPCs I've interacted with.
---
Kinda makes me hopeful for future Bethesda titles like starfield and tes6
---
hang on, remaking thread.  don't want to spread misinformation
---
you know duping in this game as been happening since day 1 right. they never really stopped it. flooding the market with duped guns only actually hurts the dupers as the value of said item becomes less. thus making it easier for you to obtain. or you can be like me and drop 3-4k script to still not get the weapon you want.. duping has and will always be apart of this game the engine is not designed to prevent it.
---
If you don‚Äôt try I can guarantee 100% you‚Äôll be right
---
if you are a carnivore, teh bonus from broiled scorched beast brain is 8+ int
---
Obviously daily limits are there to make you repeat your log ins, give you a false sense of time investment that justifys atoms for some cool cosmetics along the way, or better yet, FO1st.
---
I UNDERSTAND why it's done, if i could of blasted out the Reputation system, i would've, and probably spent less time on the game.
---
But there comes a point where people look and think 'fuck this' and don't bother in the first place. You can enforce daily limits, it's your game. But when you police every aspect of it, people will be turned off it.
---
I had the miss the first week of the legendary run, but because it's so daily based, I'll either have to dedicate a day or two to non stop XP grinding, or fork out money.
---
Few people will jump to the defence "It OnLy TaKeS 30 MiNuTeS" but I honestly don't care about what you have to say.
---
also PvP-focused which shows in their previous expectations for the Fallout community
---
Seems more like a Microsoft/Game Pass issue than a Bethesda issue. I've played on PC during some free weekends on both BethesdaNet and Steam. This Game Pass version is the only one that hasn't worked, and neither previous installs were on my OS drive.
---
&gt;I've definitely noticed this is a nicer community compared to a lot of other games that can be potentially PvP.  Generosity is definitely appreciated!
---
Word of advice. PvP is pretty much limited to public workshops (the game warns you) or consensual PvP battles. If you don't want to initiate PvP by accidentally shooting someone, go into the game settings and turn pacifist mode on.
---
Yes it's happened to me a few times, nothing can be done about it unfortunately.
---
What level are u?
---
Those folk at the Foundation are just ... 
---
Smug and annoying. Seriously. Paige, Ward, even Sunny gets on my nerves. 
---
Fuck em :)
---
Oh god damn that sucks
---
That‚Äôs a really cool idea!
---
I hope you've been paying it forward! Much love homie, thank you so much for the kind words &lt;3
---
Hopefully everyone is reporting the obvious ones.make sure to go into the actual support ticket and explain the reason for reporting them.  For example no one should have the jangles the moon monkey backpack or the secret fireplace yet. 
---
I started a new character when the event first launched to get those extra level up points and have done ever score challenge. No glitches or exploits where used and i only now just got to score level 26 i think. 
---
The idea is Hopefully with enough reports Bethesda will do something if for no other reason then greed. I mean this had got to be costing them money. Not only in atom sales from being able to rank up in the next few weeks. But its also going to drive off players. No one wants to play a grind game where someone else can just cheat their way to good rewards with impunity.
---
i enjoyed fashnatcht this year because i made a bunch of friends and i want to put in the work but i dont have enough time
---
shhhh thell think my lvl 20 unyielding leg is duped.
---
Flamers are good in general. Definitely the furious effect makes the difference, I would say. I have a 3 star Vampires as well, but the 1 star furious melts things quicker without using as much fuel.
---
You can‚Äôt make everyone happy. But it would at least add some variety to the run. 
---
One of the biggest complaints is tied to the reduction in Atoms and the increase in ‚ÄòBethesda decides what we get in place of the Atoms‚Äô. This would at least add some player control back. 
---
Even if they did this with non-returning items; do you want PA Paint X or PA Paint Y?  Or do you want PA Paint or Secret Service Paint X?
---
I‚Äôm not as excited for the same PA paint for multiple different versions. I never run T-45, so that Atomic Onslaught paint I‚Äôll likely never use on that, especially since I can run it on T-51. But something similar on Combat Armor?  That‚Äôs a maybe. 
---
Nothing‚Äôs perfect, but I do like having the variety of options.
---
I think every problem in this game can be summed up with "it should not take [x time] to do [x simple task]."
---
Dude why do you keep bothering with that, just buy a god roll legacy for caps from someone
---
I came here to say too, this they should just put this system into it like Fallout 4 it's very simple
---
its an everday thing is why its hard
---
Even better: narrator: "The kid just rages for a while..."
---
Got a point there :-)
---
not really something new, I use a bloodied combat rifle and bloodied crit handmade and can one shot just about all mobs outside sheepsquatch and SBQ.  And gutsy's them tough bastards
---
It‚Äôs not a free giveaway. It‚Äôs a challange. One you don‚Äôt seem to be inclined to even attempt. So why should you be rewarded!
---
Being directly teleported to an interior of another camp that has a trap set up, means i get killed instantly or slowly.
---
I have seen camps that while the owner of the camp is there, they modify their camp so it instantly kills you on the spot, they loot, and then log off the server. I think they go into workshop mode and place some contraption on top of you. It is not my idea of a fun time. 
---
I would rather not be teleported to either a trap camp or a hack instakill camp. So no thanks. 
---
On another note. You can move your camp hub after you place your orginal camp spot down and this will change where you spawn. You have to teleport to your own camp multiple times to figure out where the perfect placement for it is, but it does in fact work 100%
---
I know have people spawn on a certain side of my camp so they see the entrance, my vendors, etc, instead of spawning on a cliff or in the water. 
---
So end of the day, the feature is pretty much already there for you so you can use it if you wish.
---
Mine popped up the exact same way. Happened yesterday too. Bethesda won‚Äôt do anything about it. I just want the ghilie backpack but I‚Äôm probably done with this game. Wastelanders was good for new content but now it‚Äôs the same bullshit as before wastelanders. I don‚Äôt know how they expect to get multiple years out of the same game.
---
I wish for more variation of things to do endgame. Also gathering or hoarding or collecting endgame is pointless due to stash-size.
---
I wish we had some more event like the KillZone game and with higher level enemies instead of killing lvl30 enemies when I'm 50+.
---
I just feel they gave out so many damn plans and masks lol.
---
Makes me think of the Hot Pocket Joke.
---
Open package, dump in toilet.
---
*Sings* Diarrhea Pocket
---
That's why I farm XP in private worlds, as a melee player it's become difficult to get many during events.
---
thats a idiotic way to think i just want to be able to play casual and get the ability to unlock it
---
If more people got a taste of that Gauss shotgun I have a feeling people would change course pretty fast. The Gauss Minigun looks sexy from the outside, but in reality is just an expensive ammo pig. IMO the shotgun is best new weapon from WL.

I was part of the monster mash event yesterday and got punched by a player so hard I instantly got disconnected from the server, losing all my loot and even items I had just picked up.
---
I had just been to my workshop to pick up everything from extractors 
---
I want them to experience this
---
 "Or you are willing to spend real money, which I absolutely refuse to do."
---
If this is your attitude then what incentive do the devs have to make changes that make you happy? I mean they're in the business of making money first and foremost. 
---
"A bit more communication between the Devs and us can't hurt and should not be dismissed as being an unreasonable request. We supply feedback, feedback gets passed along, can we get some info back?"
---
I'm not sure why people expect feedback from game developers when that is not the expectations they setup. They ask for you to give them feedback, they get that feedback at weekly or monthly meetings and go back to work on whatever they're working on. I guess the team could spend some time responding to your long list of questions but then they have to do that for every request and complaint they receive. Who determines what the "important" problems are? And what if you don't see or like the response? It's honestly easier and better for them to keep their mouths shut and listen.
---
  "All this post is about is to get a bit more communication out of Bethesda and the people who are fine with the defeaning silence on just about every single issue, question, problem we have, feel free to not reply and move along."
---
Now you tell people to not reply on an open forum designed to breed discussion if they disagree with you? Yeah, if I was a game dev I would be chomping at the bit to have a dialogue with fans like you.
---

I killed the Scorch Beast Queen and it straight up dropped 0 loot for me, I wonder which is worse haha.
---
&gt; Fuck em :)
---
Smug and annoying are the only bit of personality they have. I wish we could get the US Army remnants and Penelope to join the raiders because they're way too good for Foundation.
---
wdym they basically want this to be my job i dont have the ability to do that
---
It is literally impossible for FO76 to ever really bounce back from its original launch. It was so bad that it turned some people off of not only Fallout, but any future Bethesda game. Luckily for Beth, the game has a steady and active player base. It can survive for a long time if they treat them well and provides them with the things they want (content, bug fixes, no caps).
---
Some people can't get on every day for an hour or more, I don't think that's even controversial is it?  Some people are busy 5/7 days or more.  That why pass systems have banking, to not alienate people with busy lives.

bethesda stated. they removed the bonus for animated cards due to complaints. of players being forced to trade animated gold cards over the non animated ones. people wont be  now forced to break up their collections. now all cards are worth the same points. i had already started upping animated cards just to hold for trading. thus wasting tons of non animated cards in the process.
---
Worked for me. This was less than a month ago. I haven't heard anything about recent patches that changed this. Moved my camp hub and now I have the exact location I wish people to spawn at my camp.
---
She tried to pick up a cub? She... tried to pick... up... a... bear cub.
---
I think I‚Äôm gonna duplicate a nocturnal bashing damage faster movement speed Gatling gun and sell them to new players for whatever scrap they have. I‚Äôll tell them it‚Äôs the best weapon currently.
---
the raiders are only slightly less assholey than the settlers..
---
that said I still wish the game would allow me to shoot many more of them from both sides in the face to death than it does..
---
BOS isnt even here yet and its possible I hate them even more..
---
so far 2 out of my 3 toons Ive sided with the raiders.. the 3rd Ill do settlers just to see that POV..
---
end of the day/TLDR I hate them all.. but the raiders slightly less so...
---
Including NW for 1 daily and 1 weekly challenge is a really cynical ploy to get people to buy atom shop gear, since that's the only stuff you can bring to NW. It would be my preference if you could get your SCORE equally from NW, Adventure, or both, but since you can't they should have just left NW out completely rather than task people with these asinine challenges. It's a shitty half measure that doesn't make anyone happy
---
I think Bethesda looks at the number$.
---
Still getting snide comments about me keepin' all the gold.
---
Still no thanks for not letting them turn into the Scorched.
---
Half an hour a day for a job?  When u get into the real world your in for a hell of a shock!
---
I hope this gets answered.
---
it was a free thing but they want me to put 24 hours and 7 days a week of my life into it i literally cannot do it
---
Sadly changing servers doesn‚Äôt reset the fields. I know your pain as well I had to do that and it took me 2 hours to find a server with the crops there.
---
You can actually do it ever other day since they reset at noon eastern time. I can do today‚Äôs dailies and I could wait till Sunday morning to do the next set of dailies. And I have. They take maybe an hour depending on your knowledge of the game.
---
So not hard, not every day.
---
That‚Äôs because PC hardware/software is perfectly capable of handling the game. Unfortunately on console (where my friends play) it feels like last generation performance.
---
You are a complainer, you could deal with this in a variety of ways but instead are choosing to complain.  I see you have many comments and posts complaining as well. 
---
You can‚Äôt have everything you want at all times.   Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  But that‚Äôs just life.
---
&gt; people don't mistake me for a new player.
---
Your think that would work, but I've had several people try to give stuff to my leveling alt.  I'm wearing the pirate costume from mischief night and shooting things with an exploding pipe rifle. Read the room dude!
---
I get caught. I create a new account. As soon as old one is unbanned after a week - I transfer all my stuff from old to new and continue exploiting.
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt get paid and instead now has 2 user records to manage/maintain.
---
New email account costs me nothing, but maintenance of each additional record in a database has cost associated with it for Beth.
---
Shopping and perks like bodyguard
---
Bethesda just isn't on our side anymore. We can try our best to keep the community pure and fun but BGS just doesn't really care about what we value.
---
Only if we can record our own messages.
---
Please post this were developers can see it. I think it's a fantastic compromise and won't cheat bethesda out of that sweet sweet green stuff.
---
PA needs some real love if it's gonna tempt people who don't really like to use it to transition. Especially when stuff like unyielding exists and gives me like 45 in strength and int for not much effort with the right cards- something that's very useful on this legendary run right now :D
---
I heard about moving the camp building device deployable, I'm referring more to the floor mat item that put precisely where you wanted to load in at. Is that what you were referring to?
---
Imo no they don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why with the new updates they have pc players test things for them so they don‚Äôt have to. I‚Äôm on xbox and would like to be able to test things but I don‚Äôt see that happening.
---
Patched what?
---
180 but ive had the game forever
---
I mean it‚Äôs called trading yet you can‚Äôt actual trade, only buy or sell so I agree
---
Duping
---
Yeah you‚Äôre talking nonsense. It‚Äôs half an hour or so to complete the daily‚Äôs and maybe two hours tops to do the weekly. I‚Äôm level 37 and haven‚Äôt played much. If u can 1 shot everything it‚Äôs easy.
---
Think about the terrible things people would say though
---
?
---
Bethesda has marched 76 into a really ugly place right now. What should have been the salvation of the game has been entirely undercut by a myriad of issues, too many to list here and we all know them anyway. Bethesda's decision to lean HEAVILY into this time-gate daily log in bullshit is maybe the most spiteful choice they've made since release and that is fuckin saying something.
---
&gt; end of the day/TLDR I hate them all
---
As you should. This is literally the theme of every single faction in the entire Fallout universe. There's not a single one who is perfect, they all have at least one major flaw. Some more than other, of course.
---
Independent Vegas is basically the only one that could possibly be "perfect" but it's never expanded on since it's just a choice at the end of the game.
---
too bad?
---
very few games have easy to grind battle passes, at least ones that are completely free
---
Check peoples camps, many people plant corn for adhesive farms. That respawns every few minutes or so.
---
Closing vendors bots would be a risky move as it would essentially close all caps generation for the new players on Xbox gamepass This is probably why they haven‚Äôt addressed yet . $$ comes first ya know
---
yea this games idea of tutorials. is like teaching a blind kid who to catch a marble in a hail storm. i was levle 10 in NW before i found out the rewards i was getting were just stupid player icons not crates i couldn't find in my inventory. or lvl 15 before i figured out how to deploy a C&gt;A&gt;M&gt;P system. level 25 befroe i realized when i moved camp it mushed my entire camp into a blueprint and i had to break it ot get it all out. i was just wasting materials rebuilding the camp over and over.
---
I'm not surprised. I play almost daily and just hit ally with them 2 days ago.
---
Have you exited out of the game? That should fix it
---
IP ban...
---
The wording seems pretty direct to me. I don't think it needs to be said any clearer. Recieving the rewards is another thing entirely though. :D
---
I wouldn't mind that at all.  More explosions the better
---
Especially if they threw in a ‚Äòget the second option for 150 Atoms‚Äô choice. 
---
The original players get access to it for about three months. It‚Äôs really no different than a Vaulted Atom Shop item returning later, with or without a discount.
---
I‚Äôll see about a more detailed write up later and post it as it‚Äôs own content. 
---
Although I‚Äôm worried about my idea getting ‚Äòcorrupted‚Äô like the [T.E.N.T.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cabmj6/a_qol_suggestion_an_extra_temporary_minicamp_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I proposed a year ago...
---
its an everday thing though
---
No they're too busy scratching their asses.
---
I restarted on PC, but when I reach the endgame I do a lot of events and just chilling at camps and vendors. I haven't seen the community this active with each other since Fasnacht ended. I dig the public teams a lot, and seasons have great potential to get everyone involved more (shady atomic shop strategy aside).
---
 I await the nerf of events and building teams because of the insane xp you can get. Don't want players having too much fun progressing in your game now.
---
VPN. Your turn.
---
Do you understand why the dupe happens? 
---
It‚Äôs a combination of using lag and exploiting how the game saves the character and NPC state.
---
That‚Äôs not an easy change
---
It's only perfect because everyone's a hero in their own eyes.
---
Lol at level 37. I‚Äôm level 247
---
Psssst! Hey kids, wanna buy some legacies? First one free, go tell your friends.
---
since I played pre-wastelanders I find them super offensive in this game.. way moreso than factions in previous games...
---
Yeah. Why would I bother with the atomic shop if I can't build anything new?
---
finally, someone with the guts to help
---
Seeing how shitty the servers are your VPN will have to be amazing to handle this
---
You have to go loot a lot of stuff to get them to respawn.
---
Right now only 0.6% of players have become allies with Foundation on PS4. That is lower than the amount of people who have the platinum trophy from the base game.
---
As I said in the OP, I tried a lot more than that unfortunately.
---
There was just a massive dupe on the best weapons in the game. So that may be part of it.
---
They could just make it so u cant access your social tab when you are in a trade
---
Done both... On PS4
---
Is it possible that you just aren't getting the notification to join the fight until they are almost done?
---
ah anyways i still dont got time like you nerds so
---
Same, a lot of the time I kill a small enemy that is legendary but they go flying and if it lands in grass I‚Äôll normally look for it until I give up because it‚Äôs basically like picking a needle in a hay stack!
---
Oh yeah didn‚Äôt even think of that....
---
its more common now but it could still go either way really...
---
Latency will only help me dupe.
---
"I'd rather pay atoms for perk coins rather than having to scrap cards then getting little in return" Mark my words.. That it coming. And there will be sheep flocking to defend bughesda for these increasing monetization decisions.
---
That's the point.
---
Not sure if it will help or explain anything but just in case...
---
When our 1st expires/renews there's always an oddity. For me, it will apply 1st status right away when it auto-renews, but I wont get the Atoms for about a day after.When my spouse has the sub auto-renew, some times their 1st status isn't applied and takes a day after, and it gets applied the same time their Atoms show up.
---
We have no idea what's going on or why it 'lags' Atoms for me and service for them. Something between Steam and Bethesda maybe.
---
Yep and challenges like build 10 things. Takes a minute. Kill 10 scorched. Takes 2 minutes. Gain a level takes the time.
---
Its not gonna be laten- [You Have Been Disconnected From The Server]
---
that‚Äôs not necessarily an easy code fix, plus the hassle to get it on PS4 and Xbox
---
i can go get both modern warfare and fortnite battle pass and get 100% just doing casual
---
thus why i don't care about the legendary perk system they designed for endgame team play. for a game that has no endgame. or need for team play. the rewards they had for the past raid is now buyable with gold from a npc. ...ance seing as how all the SBQ drops are tradable. no need to do that as i can vendor bu all of it. i dont need to work my rear off for 10 years to finally be able to craft 80% more ammo. or auto pick locks i avoid now as i dont need any more FINGING MISSLE DROPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Finally someone with the guts to help !
---
No not this time unfortunately. I specifically waited for the nuke timer to count down. But I was doing something and was just about 30-60 seconds late.
---
I think with the game pass happening on Xbox it‚Äôs too much of a challenge for them to turn off the station vendors, wouldn‚Äôt want to drive away new players. But for players like me who‚Äôve played since launch I am done for a while. I stuck by this game and stuck up for Bethesda and have put close to 1100 hours in. The only reason I really play is to grind for legendaries to trade, what‚Äôs the point when I‚Äôm finding B2525 fixers for free at train stations? So I‚Äôm logging off for a while and getting back to BoTW or RDR2, see you guys when the BoS content drops.
---
Lol. Family man with a 13 hour day job with commute. Difference is I‚Äôm not an entitled child who thinks the world owes him a living.
---
No, it's only perfect because it gives the wasteland the *chance* to do things correctly themselves without anyone pulling strings. Is that likely to happen? Absolutely not, because humans are stupid as shit.
---
What‚Äôs instanced interior????
---
You may be in luck, there‚Äôs a dupe going on so it‚Äôs bringing down the price of most of the good legendaries.
---
Bold but wrong assumptions, sorry.
---
Thanks. I mean, I'm not asking for upvotes. Im just genuinely curious about what rubbed people wrong about my post.
---
I wasn't doing the Vox. Are they togeather?
---
Or one mini nuke
---
One of the best parts about a Can Do! trash can food run in Whitespring is setting off the atomic fireworks when you're done.
---
No, but if you move the camp building device, you could get the spawn point to be right next to, if not directly on top of a floor mat. I only spent 5 minutes moving my camp device around, I simply wanted people spawning outside my camp but on a certain side of the building. I noticed whenever I moved it, forward, back, left, right, it moved the camp spawn directly proportional to where I placed the camp building device. 
---
Original location, I had people spawning inside my house, inside of a wall. Moved the camp item a few feet, and they still spawned inside my home but no longer in the wall. Play around with it. I think its possible to get people to spawn where you want with some tinkering.
---
The grind to keep grinding theme is a semi-common one in games.
---
I have done almoast 1500 hours, I feel the same way
---
then go play those games
---
Only when you have assholes ruining it for everyone.
---
It‚Äôs not about what‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs about what‚Äôs convenient
---
and this isn‚Äôt even hard, for crying out loud it‚Äôs been a week and a half and i‚Äôm 1/3 of the way through with only about an hour a night and after missing two days and skipping NW challenges
---
rather it be 30 seconds than lasting 15+ mins like it used to.
---
the last word gets the dmg req even with people melting her.
---
You owe your loyalty to noone but yourself ... I say do it! DEW IT!
---
I honestly kill every random encounter NPC I come by, doesn't even need to have a star. The Steel Scrap i get out of their weapons is enough. That's like 50 more bullets i can craft!
---
I think the big take away here is do what you want, and if you dont want to join me, go join elsewhere.
---
But would anyone pay for a VPN just to duplicate some weapins in a game? How much of a loser does someone have to be to want a Fixer that bad that they struggle through the process of making a new account and getting a VPN

My original post, both title and text body, were not complain-y in nature at all. Merely a suggestion. Your shitty smart ass responses have proc‚Äôd any negativity going on here.

No shit nobody can have everything. But anybody can suggest anything. Which is something many people on this sub apparently disagree with. Normal games don‚Äôt fuck their consumers in as many ways as this game. It would be nice if y‚Äôall would get annoyed by it as well.

Yeah, so the first time I blew up the cars at Whitesprings, I didn't realize they would blow up and I was right in the middle of them. It was a glorious chain reaction, and then ded.
---
2 words gauss fucking shotgun
---
well, is an easy pick. Raiders have the ammo crafting machine on ally while settlers have the "turd grenade" crafting machine. 
---
I also raised raiders to ally before settlers, finished the settlers reputation like 3-4 days ago.
---
I give it exactly 1 day before people start claiming that Bethesda is BaNnInG Me FoR NoThInG just to screw me out of another $7! This is Extortion! 
---
Given all the bad press they‚Äôve gotten, Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to try something involving forcing players to give them more money
---
idk my idcon on the right side shows 3 cards and the number 185ish. and i think thers only 70 something cards
---
Damn, sorry hope it gets resolved
---
I don't get why the dichotomy for you is the shitty idea they have now... or spending money.  There's a third hidden option of just fixing the system so it's more player friendly and not another cash farm.
---
Have you seen the prices of B2525 Fixer on eBay before this public dupe fiasco?
---
And absolutely.
---
Ironclad + evasive + barbarian adds quite a bit of DR
---
I currently have 493 DR 344 ER 199 RR
---
Great post and i second this. 
---
Its finally my time to say goodbye as well (3.3k hrs gampelay).
---
This mass dupe wave was the last straw for me. 
---
Geting back to my previous game (ffxiv) is like geting back to the future where everything works and with 346days worth of playtime, yet to see a single exploit/glitch.
---
Fo76 is like play with rocks and sticks.
---
Game had so much potential but devs are really bad or underpayed or whatever. It doesnt matter now.
---
Comunity is great indeed. Made very good friends and i hope our bond wont fade hence the diferent games played.
---
All the best everyone and stay safe.
---
I don't know dude lying about your past seems a lot less bad then murdering people and stringing up the bodies. Just my take
---
I would say absolutely, if you can get your hands on a nice rolled shotty, qe double barrel or bloodied/junkies shotgun of any kind you'll find it very viable. Power armor is actually less effective in most cases now than normal armor, even before secret service. There are lots of great easy to find build tutorials on how to make non PA characters tanky. I suggest Angryturtles channel, I know he's done some non PA tanky build vids. Are you on xbox? Ive got some decent shotties burning a hole in my stash.
---
Alright let me re-phrase this. Imagine being such a loser you spend real money on a gun in a videogame that I got for giving someone a Faschnat mask a month ago
---
I usually place my camp between Gilmans and the haunted cabins myself. Nice out of the way location.
---
Daily limits there are to keep you from playing other games. It's so obvious but became even more apparent with Wastelanders. With Wastelanders came Gold Bullion. If there were no limits to how much gold you can get everyday, people would get every single plan in a week, get every single endgame item in a week and be done with the game. You farm for around 4 days for a single limb armor plan for instance. Then Scrip comes into play, you want to be able to craft that SS Armor Lef Leg? You can, at the cost 1 Legendary Module which you can get with Scrips. You can craft 3 Armor Pieces with daily limit of 150 Scrip. 4 if you do enough Daily Quests to gather another 50. But RNG will insist on not giving you that Unyielding SS Left Leg you want and you'll have to come back tomorrow. In the meanwhile you'll be farming for the plans for SS Right Leg, then Torso, then Jetpack. You'll also be grinding Reputation to be able to access Gauss Shotgun and Gauss Minigun Plans but you have choose which faction you'll favor so you'll max rep with one then farm a bit more for the other. You'll log in everyday. It'll be routine, when you admit to yourself it's your new routine, you'll start thiking of ways to make it different so it doesn't get boring. At that point you'll realize how boring your camp is, you need to spice it up, "EXPRESS YO'SELF." You'll make a great camp but you don't have that Contemporary Building Set which would make your home really cool. You'll start wondering whether you should get F1st because it would make things more practical and be a quality of life improvement, 1650 Atoms will also be a plus, you'll be able to get them cosmetics you want. You'll subscribe at some point. You'll start to farm like crazy to stock up on junk when you learn you'll still be able to take from Scrapbox when your sub ends. Simply farming everything will make you realize how many seconds not thinking about what to loot and what to leave shaves off of your playtime so you'll keep your sub.
---
Tl;dr daily limits are there to keep you playing and spending in the meantime. They don't want you to play the game for 100 hours in just one week and then quit without seeing how cool that new set of cosmetics is.
---
Of course it's not controversial... I don't play every either. But that's not what OP was complaining about... He's complaining that the challenges are "too hard" because there's a kill 3 legedaries. This is not a difficult challenge. In fact it's something that happens on any given session, usually. I did all of today's in 45 minutes, and could have done 30 minutes but I did Line In The Sand for the event challenge, which is a longer event. And also, this is exactly what they said it would be... It would take roughly an hour to two hours to do these.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 342 now and have played since the beginning 
---
Bethesda is notorious for doing stealth nerfs or buffs and we all know the game is buggy as hell including VATS right now. 
---
A few months back I noticed some of the enemies appeared to take more and dish out more damage.  My auto rifle build and power armor hasn‚Äôt changed in over a year.  Yet I find myself taking more damage and certain enemies and critters are far more challenging now.  All except the deathclaw.  Go figure.
---
I could put in a link to my Nukedragons shotgun build if you want you could change things if you want it worked well for me no pa.  
---

---
Go naked. I tried the broken armor route but it was a hassle. Now it's just me and my outfit. Even one point of DR will reduce the weapon's output.
---
It's such a shame. This game has had so many things added that COULD HAVE been amazing additions that really brought new life to the dumpster fire 76 is turning into. Instead, beth takes these cool ideas and covers them from head to toe in ridiculous time-gates, or hides it behind a pay wall. 
---
I don't have to work for a living and I STILL don't have the time to do half the crap beth thinks I need to do to make a quarter inch of progress towards something that honestly doesn't change my gameplay at all.
---
And it's depressing. 76 has some amazing people playing it, and could have been this vibrant expansion on lore and gameplay... but it's not. And as naive as it makes me, I can't help hoping they fix this crap so we can actually enjoy the experience.
---
I use SS Armor and AA 50% limb dam Fancy Shotgun
---
Arguably playing with a team for anything other than SBQ is a downside as loot isn't shared, so you have to be sure you don't one shot anything.
---
It‚Äôs been proven here, on this sub, that you can finish the legendary run completely before 10 weeks is over. People don‚Äôt abuse xp exploits because they can‚Äôt finish in time, they do it because they just want everything right now and don‚Äôt care about being able to say ‚ÄúSee? I earned that.‚Äù
---
people going on about battlepass is a cure for insomnia i tell you
---
Shotgun got nerfed a while back. It‚Äôs not nearly as powerful as before. That said, It‚Äôs still viable as the game is not difficult once you are able to nail down stable sources for food and water. 
---
Once you‚Äôre over 100 and have some perk choices and gear you can run any terrible build and it‚Äôs adequate. 
---
I personally wouldn‚Äôt run shotguns, but my wife did until 60 and it was OK.
---
And to add in to my previous comment... my favorite things to do are hunt legendaries for good drops, and when the wendgino colossus gave me a 1* wooden vanguard arm and 3 different 3* enemies gave me unusable 1* weapons I kind of reached my own end game. It was like a come to Jesus moment. ‚ÄúWhy am I doing this?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat am I even doing here?‚Äù And on top of all that, the overwhelming and constant messaging of some players hitting me up for trades... you there bro? When you on mate? Can we trade now dude? You still have this weapon on a 17 day old post man?... I felt like a drug dealer handing out crack to people. So yeah, I‚Äôm taking a break. Will I be back? Probably. Do I feel annoyed that I put in so much time to get my first legacy laser a couple months back and now people are just getting them for caps, CAPS? It‚Äôll be hard to log back in a couple of months. I‚Äôll miss my fellow wastelanders but I blame Bethesda for this.
---
i just sneak behind them after conversation and then slice their heads off, gg ez, it dont affect reputation
---
Dude what are you talking about, with all your saved up caps you can buy god rolled legacies rights now
---
I‚Äôve got some friends who made it to 100. Their commitment to grinding is unreal.
---
how do people cheat the battle pass? asking for a friend.
---
don't blame the player, blame the inept designers that have no clue how people play their game.  
---
Public teams is a sound concept but what they made is just garbage.
---
No control of how many can join them. 
---
Overlapping buffs - which is better raw int exp from killing hundreds of trash mobs or the random double legendary kill exp bonus that you might not get the tag on for any credit?
---
Big block the map travel point so you can't click icons.
---
A big example my 2 friends and I want specific stat buff that has nothing to do with that activity, we create a public team and constantly have random 4th players join and leave when they realize we are not doing the stated activity.
---
Personnally, I dont like NW, so I don't play NW, SCORE points or not.  
---
Simple as that.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping that's what it is. But the first time I bought it, it was applied immediately. Now it's been almost 24h.
---
if your going to server hop. block a guy on the server your one. then hop so it wont put yo back on the same server again. and the game remembers the last i think 150 items you picked up. so after that they start respawning in order. so when in doubt go someplace and farm anything to get past that 150 mark then go back to your corn.
---
‚ÄúWarning. Nuclear strike imminent.‚Äù
---
I just join a group do the events that pop up for the repeatable xp and I enjoy a couple hours in my favorite game. I probably would make it to the end but I've already gotten some fun items and am enjoying the game more. I've gotten every challenge done, I'll start today at level 29.
---
I just used the repair kits to do it, barely made a dent in the stock pile.
---
Ward has you kill someone every single day, the only difference is the string. Plus you can complete both raider dailies without killing anyone. The only way to get max foundation rep is through murder.
---
Not to mention false positives. If they had a foolproof method to identify cheaters, they would have used it and cracked down already, many times. The fact that they haven't shows that they don't have a reliable tracing method or detailed records of every action we do. Innocent players would undoubtedly be caught in the crossfire, and that would be far more fucked up than people duping.
---
So many complaints/suggestions on this reddit can be reduced to: "Please make the game easier and quicker".
---
I‚Äôm pushing 2500 hours since the beta and have 2 toons that are 200+ and one that just passed 150. In between the initial run of ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù BS filler perks and now knowing that Legendary perks are now a grind that is impossible to complete...I don‚Äôt even care about the LEGO perks anymore. They took something boring and made it objectively shit. 
---
And with Bethesda just adding more grind in lieu of content, I‚Äôm just about done with this game and future Bethesda games altogether.
---
I don‚Äôt know many other companies that can fuck up this badly this consistently.
---
I've posted probably almost 50 times on xbox LFG. Nobody wants caps. Only legacy trades...
---
You are right though they are definitely missing out there
---
We must have CAMPs in the same spot. I'm in the field across the street from Gilman, backed up to the lumber bots. Went across the street earlier to drop some lvl 1 Brotherhood recon rifles and .308 ammo for some freshly-emerged dwellers. I need to set up a free vending machine for new players or something. It's nice seeing all the new fresh faces.
---
See if this might help, fools windows into thinking another drive is just folder on your ‚ÄúC‚Äù drive

---
Another hate thread, another wasted post...
---
We should be able to destroy them
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to figure out too. Been scrolling the comments hoping someone would go into detail but I don‚Äôt see anything.
---
Yeah, I think last time I looked I was like 600 hours at level 200ish, and I just laughed when I saw what they expect players to do.  Especially when you consider there is no benefit to leveling up once you have your build set beyond quests and the one day dream of getting a legendary perk card that probably won't even be that interesting if their initial offerings were any indication.    
---
Of course we all know they will try to sell you the coins, so...
---
i can one/two shot everything with my shotgun 
---
i dont wear PA
---
You need fallout 1st to grind like this. Nuke whitespring private server. Everything will be dead for 10-15 minutes. Log out then back into the private server untill everything spawns. I run around the loop of bungalos, club house work shop, by back entrance and kill everything. I set the survival tent close as possible to the clubhouse. You will stop to drop loot every circle and relog there. I usually get mats for 100+ flux( expect flora which I go get once the nuke zone 2 hours is up) and around 25-40 legendary drops.( Warning: If your off the private server longer than it takes to DC and relog the the game, the nuke zone vanishes. About 2 minutes.) There is an unusual amount of 3star gouls here and they drop unusually horrible Loot. But I also gain about 6 levels a run.
---
the only settlers/raiders I havent killed are protected by the game..
---
I have killed literally every single one that I have encountered in the wild...
---
Yup, same for us. The first time we bought 1st it was instantly applied. But ever since it's been automatically renewed, it's hiccuped for both of us in some way.
---
op deleted his post and account
---
I heard of that the other day. I wonder if that distance is constant and could be measured?
---
Their bodies are stretched by power armor. They may be in it and you don‚Äôt see the pa, or their out of it but glitched to look like their in it.
---
I've been no-regging a LOT in VATS lately, I see the damage number but the hp bar doesn't move. 
---
I swear VATS has been missing more in general too.
---
you counted to the maximum. do you really need 6 fully upgraded legendary perks? its a bonus, they give you options and you choose, what fits your playstyle. i dont think, it is a system meant for everybody to have everything. choose, but choose wisely.
---
Let me counter then. Imagine being such a loser you spend all your time grinding Fasnacht while someone in the same time makes an order of magnitude more $ it costs them to buy that gun on eBay.
---
They buy it, get on, enjoy the game without a brain numbing grind and then move on with their life to spend the rest of the money they made. And you‚Äôre left with showing off your masks in a glass box while grinding faction reputation.
---
Now that we can't die due to traps is the best moment to reintroduce the welcome mat.
---
What? These people aren't innocent they stole and they won't even give the item back without a fight. It doesn't matter that they need it, I'm sure if they went into foundation and asked for help they would get it.
---
Scary
---
Thicccüçë
---
people ride bethesda dick like a a fucking seesaw this game is just a secondary job where you gotta pay more to get stuff you want its a 24/7/12 like job except your paying them to work it
---
I told you man :) now you are one of us xD
---
yeah, whatever happened to games being fun and entertaining .. rather than irritating and grindy .. with a side of monetizing all of your activites
---
Yeah especially when their heads get snapped back and looking backwards.
---
Try using Trobleshooter Armor and weapons. Makes the event a little bit simpler.
---
Lol. I thought it's just me. Just bought a junkie shotgun. Killing level 20 enemies is as hard as killing level 60s ü§£
---
I'd never recover from that, I'd have to go back to a little hut for awhile
---
Source?
---
If you are on PC, I highly recommend [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144), or one of the many similar mods.
---
I made a pair of lv1 leather legs and shot at my feet with an explosive western revolver. Once I wasn't paying attention to my health and shot into the air and my head got stuck in my camp's ceiling with my body dangling... &gt;.&gt;
---
The stuff of horrors. Is this bethesdas punishment for the dupers?
---
I love it when I notice an NPC minding his own business by a car
---
I havent grinded Faschnat myself, just got a Raven mask on my second try and I havent nor am I planning to. What you are saying is that you would rather give your real money to someone for a gun in a video game that you can acquire for free?
---
My favorite is the flaming chainsaw + civil war dress + Fasnacht man mask. The most important thing is getting a group together all wearing dresses and Fasnacht man masks. [https://imgur.com/a/eV8yG0D](https://imgur.com/a/eV8yG0D)
---
Secret Service armors
---
Yep, I'm feeling burnout. I've pretty much stopped doing gold bullion dailies because I'm a power armor user and there isn't much of anything worth buying with it for a PA user. I've heard people say T65 isn't worth the grind.   
---
I hate, hate, hate all the caps to the currencies in the game. If I want to play all day 1 day and get 1000 scrip, I should be able to. They obviously don't care about the economy because they still haven't fixed the duping problem they've had since the game started.   
---
They turned this game into a free to play game that you still have to pay for, and locked even more qol stuff behind another pay wall.
---
Eh. Was with you until you talked about nuking whitesprings. 
---
Find a decent legendary weapon. I have a pump shotgun that I can one shot bloated in whitesprings as well as the robots in the silo. Neither are bullet sponge if you find the right gun. 
---
Tons of legendaries from whitesprings on my private server from 1 run. I can usually get around 3 loops before the nuke Depawns giving me easily 20+ legendaries for every nuke drop + plenty of flux components from bloated + Crimson(8) + Colbolt(7) + plenty of cake + raw. Even around 4 violent. All created with the super duper perk increasing what i make. 
---
Want more colbolt and crimson? Ok, nuke Morganton. Alot less legendaries but you will have plenty of crimson + colbolt + Mats to make them.
---
1) Well rested or lovers embrace;  2) Mothman Enlightenment quest; 3) Eat your favorite food that gives you an XP buff; 4) Egghead mutation if you're over level 32; 5) At events dont worry about killing but tagging an enemy- let the melee kill them.
---
I don't get why my bloodied Death Claw gauntlet is putting out some 4 times the damage with not even half the perk cards dedicated as my bloodied cultist dagger.
---
Really wanted to rock the dagger to go with my creepy nurse aesthetic but its putting out so little damage for so many perk cards dedicated to it.
---
Lol maybe.
---
I‚Äôve noticed it happens on laggy servers.
---
Of course you didn‚Äôt grind. And my time is not free.
---
Depends, metal armor has higher dr
---
ahh thank you so much!! i didn't know level 40 was a low level to do this stuff, no wonder I had such a rough time haha!
---
Yeah I did for my main weapons, I know you can use those but the point is my weapons are never at low durability, and I can't find any that are usually :D 
---
Still didn't take long but it was the biggest stumbling block today by far and even then... Just mildly inconvenient. 
---
The biggest thing that baffles me is how people are STILL sleeping on leader of the pack for the legendaries. literally 2 minutes and it's done for 3 guaranteed. I've  never seen anyone else there or contest it, and I've used it a lot lately for various challenges.
---
Yeahhh, a B25 Gauss Mini doesn't exactly sound like bad luck
---
Exactly, I will never understand those that just want to rush through as quickly as possible and then complain that there's nothing to do.
---
Just checked your posts you havent posted anything in FO76 market reddit, go there , people are selling B 25 25 Fixer and B E gatling plasma for caps, there is a dupe going on now
---
Whatever gets you closes to 400-450 in the field you want protection in. With diminishing returns, after that it doesn't matter what you shove your body into.
---
Yeah... I just wish I had it before I switched perk points üòÅ
---
Based on what i did myself, I believe it can be, but as i said, its easily done, just annoying. I am right at top of the world. So it took maybe 10 teleports to get it where I wanted it. If your looking for better placement, maybe 20 or more teleports. But I know it does work. üëç
---
I‚Äôd say either loot low level equipment to fix, or make level 1 armor and get hit a few times to repair it even if it‚Äôs not really damaged
---
is there any type of daily you wont complain about?
---
If you don't want to do it then don't do it, scrooge mcduck.
---
What we see here is a loud minority. Those here are just a small fraction of the player base.
---
I know the pain. Decide to switch build cause of something you get then get what you were wanting. Makes you question was it worth it.
---
SS Set Total	327DR	297ER	297RR
---
Metal Set Total	333DR	68ER	0RR
---
Now which one is better? That 6DR difference does not even show on damage taken because of DR dimishing returns.
---
Heavy Combat is a good all-rounder ...  
---
Secret Service otherwise.
---
Allraighty, thanks!
---
I love the carnivore perk. As a Melee focused build the stat boosts from stacking different meats is crazy. I also do the triple the effect of alcohol cards for even more strength output making whiskey stronger then buffout.
---
I still havent raided the vault...
---
Dr wise metal
---
At what point are you awarded points to apply to them?
---
Only nine more hamunaptras to go!
---
Point to another post where I complain about daily quests. Otherwise, apologise and leave this thread alone.
---
I wasn't replying to the OP, I was replying to your "lol 45 min no problem" because that's an issue. 45 minutes in a significant investment if you only have like 2-3 hours of free time a day like most people.  Especially when you admit yourself that it could take an hour or two down the line.  Every day, or at least most days (I haven't done the math) if you don't want to feel that you're just missing out because you can't log on every day.
---
I know, I know, who cares if some people miss out, its "not for everyone."  We should care.  The more people feel like they don't have a chance at this or that it's just too much time to spend every day, with no chance to do it all in one go for busy people, those people will have a much higher chance of just quitting, because Seasons are going to be the main content delivery service between the sparse events and story drops.  If it's not engaging people, that's a problem, and it effects you indirectly even if not directly.
---
There is zero reason there shouldn't be a banking system of SOME kind, it's a bog standard element of pass systems throughout the gaming world.  People with lives and families should have at least some chance of hoping to complete the track.  Right now they don't.  We should all be asking for this change, at minimum.
---
Yes it‚Äôs been said by people with bad math.
---
It miscalculated total score. 
---
It assumes you get zero xp over 70 days. 
---
It ignores double xp and double score weekends.
---
Depends on if it‚Äôs legendary or not(and what legendary effect) but besides that I‚Äôm resistance over all secret service. In my opinion anyway.
---
That's really hilarious :)
---
Yeah cause server upkeep and game development is completely free.
---
Yeah. Will do. Ive been on the xbox LFG page. Lots of people are posting about them but seems like nobody's selling them through there..
---
I'm thinking 50 levels per card level up point, anyone else agree or want to elaborate?
---
Boxing Gloves. Got a BSS one. I think it has the fastest seing speed of all unarmed weapons, and its fun boxing with ghouls.
---
Yeah vats shotgun builds will one or two shot almost anything. The only thing that sucks is the sbq
---
You know better than that!
---
This legendary run game is NOT supposed to be fun!
---
We keep playin' um, so they keep making um.  :(    
---
Skinner boxes work, it's just psychology.
---
I'm thinking spawn in, place camp floor item at feet, go to your camp build station, place another small camp item, place a third small item to represent north or some other orientation, blueprint it, place a copy of the new blueprint down with the first item where you want to load in, rotate the blueprint to match proper orientation before placing it, move the camp build station to the second item you placed before, and then see if it worked.
---
Add this to the list of another Bethesda fuck up
---
Perkeles
---
at least the creatures aren't hacking
---
In my opinion I like handmades and lmgs even tho lmgs go through my ammo supply in less than an hour üòÇ.
---
I did this not understanding how it exactly worked ran into a wall at level 70 and decided ah let‚Äôs start over and this time I‚Äôm having way way more fun playing and I‚Äôm only level 25
---
Hahahaa
---
I had one job...
---
i have god tier roles mostly because i bought them but itd still be nice to be able to spend less scrip for shitty roles
---
Check it out u might get lucky, I say also check out in game player vendors u might find some there some people in found them at the white Spring train station vendor
---
Downloading it right now on xbox because of the gamepass hope it is as fun as it looks
---
No tears from me!  Congrats on the roll though
---
Can't afford it yet :/
---
Weren't you the one complaining that lovers embrace doesn't count for the well rested daily a while back. Just saying haha
---
I have one myself and love using it as I run through white springs.
---
Yeah I don't care about your problems
---
I'm used to bodies missing or going underground now. What I saw yesterday was wild, the Deathclaw I killed disappeared as soon as I came upon it lol it never re-appeared either as a meat pile, gone. Oh well, I thought.. it happened later with a Super Mutant.
---
I watched an InnovSurvivalist video later and it's happening to her too. She's on PC and I'm on PS4.
---
Lol seems on par for this game. Only fitting, nothing else works right either(still love the game though).
---
Yeah, it is addictive. But it does feel really choppy during combat because of frame rate. I have a decent pc Maybe I'll give it a try.
---
Ah well then leather for energy, metal for ballistic, and combat for overall.
---
I tried handing them stims they just ran off
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Played fo4 4 times for each faction. (I actually think most people did)
---
Whatever u gonna be getting from murms  right now is gonna be useless or insignificant compare to other people who you're gonna be playing with are going to have everyone is going to melting things meanwhile you're have a bloodied bashing damage fixer sihk
---
Should i go regural combat or bos?
---
I like how that looks. Are mutations still like before where you just went yolo and acquired them all or is it more nuanced now.
---
Sorry! It used to work.
---
It happens a lot to my friends and I. And the answer is , when you die in a power armor, sometimes when you come back to life and you exit it, everything will be normal on your screen. But to other players, it still looks little you are in power armor. Which is why you see them stretched out like that.
---
Hi everyone! I am reaching out to a few of you who are still experiencing issues with some questions to help our investigation. Please check your chat messages :)
---
Gatling guns are kinder on your ammo supply , my personal fave
---
Single action revolvers make me feel like Clint Eastwood
---
Well, I'm glad I've finally had a way to use up at least some of the repair kits that I'm drowning in... But yeah, either use an explosive weapon on yourself or find random weapons to repair.
---

I prefer the Foundation. They‚Äôre not wallowing in filth and junk, constantly crowing about taking from other people like it‚Äôs their right and casually walking around under bodies impaled on spikes.

 &gt; Hi everyone! I am reaching out to a few of you who are still experiencing issues with some questions to help our investigation. Please check your chat...
---
Isn't there a roadmap with lots of good stuff on the way?
---
Well there are people who sell them. I just say for my build it‚Äôs meant to be bloodied so make sure you have adrenal reaction it helps. It‚Äôs basically the bloodied effect for your weapon if it not bloodied.
---
wanna buy a gun i know a guy? just jokking. they cant stop it. its a evolving thing. that the engine isnt designed to stop
---
Yea they doubled down a little too hard on the PA paint I think... same with ghillie. 
---
Also I thought level 76 would be something special. Nope, just the same PA paint for the 65
---
Id go bos
---
Do you guys ever get the scavenger who asks you take a picture of him then when you bring out your camera he does this creepy smile? After you do that he just thanks you and walks away sp I murder him on the spot for wasting a place on my photo gallery
---
The massive dupe wave has made caps worth something again because people have to spend caps to perform the glitch, so they're burning through all their stacks. That, and the guns themselves are becoming less valuable in the process. 
---
I find a vampires explosive faster reload handmade in someone's vendor least night for 2500 caps, and my buddy found a B2525 Fixer for 20k.
---
I suppose granting temporary immunity when you arrive like they do in NW is too much to ask?
---
Ty
---
Just go to blackwater mine, kill some mole miners and then take some of the shotguns you get, put on weapon artisan and repair them.
---
Np happy to give my opinion.
---
Not my problems mate, the games problems, all players problem, but thanks for being a great example of short sighted self absorption.  üôÑ
---
Railway rifle choo choo
---
Oh man, you had to dig deep. So not being able to get "well rested" due to having a companion in camp (obvious bug) counts as "complaining"?. Sheesh..
---
I have always thought they should make it so everyone has the welcome mat plans from the start and that could be used as a spawn location when fast traveling... It only made sense to me ...
---
10mm pistols and Laser Rifles are my favorite guns hands down in Fallout but I feel like it needs to be Bloodied or Junkies to be viable.
---
Or maybe fix this dupe glitch. It‚Äôs really fucking good finding all the shit I‚Äôve been trying so hard to trade for, but having 26 legacies and a set of ass/sentinel armor by stealing it from dupers was hilarious but now I have nothing to grind for.
---
You are right! Dont rush the game. Explore, craft, build and take pics in awesome locations and situations. Stash management is something I enjoy (sometimes)
---
I find non-combat shotguns, the lever gun, and black powder weapons are fun but dont have the perks for a rifle build with them.
---
what weapon/armor is the cheapest to repair?
---
I would just make an alt for different builds because of the way perk cards are gonna be used for legendary perks
---
Hey all! I am reaching out to a few of you via chat messages with some questions to help aid our investigation. Please check your chats!
---
Gamma gun, really like to use it now against humans. Also shovels make the best noise.
---
She is still alive and well. You can find her popping up out of the ground in certain locations on the map. She‚Äôs even willing to give you a ride to various location North, South, and in the Savage Divide/Mire.
---
If you get close, you‚Äôll feel the rumbling.
---
Hail yeah brother!
---
I'm pretty sure its team related. Private teams have had this where if you were in relative close proximity to a teammate that killed a legendary, you got to loot it. I think that carries over to public teams.
---
I can see that point. There‚Äôs always a sale when your funding dries up, why games go on sale, but if you‚Äôre always offering a discount then why should anyone buy full price?  I just know that if I have paid for first from day 1 and they turn around and offer up all items at a discount, they will be refunding a lot of unhappy customers along with losing lots of folks.
---
Hey you asked to be pointed to a complaint about a daily haha that's all.
---
If you have high luck odds are nothing will drop in need of repair.  üòî
---
Last night I joined encrypted died like 5 times kills the damn thing I die get the respawn bug and since it‚Äôs a robot it HAS I MEAN HAS TO EXPLODE sending it god knows and when I rejoin the lobby can‚Äôt be found 
---
Yay I loved burning through all those stims and ammo
---
I love my be 50 cal. Literally 50 cal go BRRRRRRT. 50 cal is one of the most ammo friendly weapon since you can craft ammo in large quantities for cheap
---
The system is new, this is the time to give feedback.
---
Can we also up the vault steel she sells? Hopping three times to make a piece is not fun..

 &gt; Greatly appreciate that, thank you very much!
---
Doubt it. Ward even says with some items that he lied to you and it‚Äôs not their last (whatever), it‚Äôs the principle. Still say Ward is either incompetent or selling the items on the side (both, likely). 
---
Single best thing about maxing on foundation rep is going to ward and refusing to be his personal hitman, then listening to him complain.
---
To be fair 10 is rather excessive, 3 would be ok.
---
It is. It shouldn‚Äôt be tho
---
100% correct no one is forcing you to be in MY team now Bethesda is forcing you to be in A for a new currency. but fear not in a few months it starts all over again and well get  some new currency for some new thing. all the while its SSDD in the wasteland and me and my boys are just doing our thing in our way.. pew pew ladies pew pew
---
You could make a bunch of level 1 boards or destroy a bunch of level 1-5 scorched and take their weapons.
---
It was a question. As in 'Is there any type of of daily you wont complain about?' 
---
I'll break it down for you
---
is there a daily challenge (a challenge you do daily)
---
you (you)
---
wont complain about (wont complain about)
---
All challenges use a resource of some kind. Whether that resource is time, caps, or materials.
---
"The team" is the nickname for their household trash can
---
Because they probably don't know about the INT XP boost? I just wonder why so few people share perk cards.
---
LOL...sorry, early on I wasn't paying attention on Encyptid, and absent minded ported in, saw 4 or so "idiots" just standing around and ran into the shack and proceeded to start it up. One guy ran in after me madly dancing around, (what's up with this guy?) then it hit me, uh, I probably shouldn't have stated this...crap. One guy thumbs downed me and left, the others kinda looked like they were all glaring at me...but I stayed out of shame, event started, a few other people jumped in, and we finished it...lesson learned.
---
Im 160 and I started at wastelanders üòú
---
For the basic playthrough agree, but I understand people just wanting to be done with the "end game" grinds, as they are just joyless chores.
---
I love my Wiffle Ball bat. It is an Atom shop item so not everyone has it, but the sound it makes when hitting things is quite satisfying. Railway rifles are also a good time. The ammo is cheap but quite heavy so plan ahead. Put on an auto piston and stick to VATS. You'll be toot-tooting a bloody path across the wasteland in no time.
---
I agree. 3 would be fine. They said the challenges would be in line with "natural game play" - 10 repairs in a day is nothing I usually do. More like 10 a week at the most.
---
I‚Äôm level 300 and if I have to take a workshop for a challenge I do it crouching and on the green/red boarder ready to nope outta there if I need to.
---
That's just a band-aid, like every other duping fix they've put in. Somebody will find another hole soon enough. How their system handles item transfers needs a complete overhaul. The overall design patterns to fix this are mostly solved problems (network traffic does add some complication), but Bethesda programmers apparently think the term "atomic operation" means buying something from their store.
---
Some people just have no patience
---
I couldn't progress until I had another quest where I had to talk to her on a different matter.
---
Thanks for making a simple-minded fool like me understand your sarcasm.
---
I'll respond to your question: Yes.
---
This really is the #1 advice for me also. Exploring is the best way to play this game. Fast traveling everywhere and speed clicking through terminals you miss a lot. Of course it‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs like picking up a book, flipping through the pages without reading a word and then complaining the story didn‚Äôt draw you in.
---
Well shit... I've been trying to farm the witch costume for days. I've found 5 or 6 ski outfit plans. This explains so much, thank you!
---
Totally agree they are doing their best but the RNG is killing me to I've decent weapons and armour but I play nearly every day at least 5 hours a day. I've been grinding the events and dailys for the rare outfits and after two months of grind I have the responders helmet to show for it was buzzing when I got it but I'm literally talking every event that pops up I'm doing all over map ms I've one item to show for it in a two month..... I'd like to see all item I could possibly get in a menu when you hover over event in map. So I know what I could get and I'd like the rates to be improved. Lot also I think all weapons should go the way of the legendary module. This would reduce the RNG   massively. Want a legendary fixer craft one with modules etx.
---
Same here.I'd be way higher if I just grinded XP.
---
This bug has been around since the BETA
---
In the year and a half i have been playing this game i have only seen 1 high player 1124.thats it.
---
I agree who the hell thought that was a good idea?smh.
---
Tell it to the suits!
---
Ah figures, thanks!
---
Hey, OP here. Just so you know, installing the game via gamepass on a drive separate to your OS drive seems to be the culprit. Moved to C: today and can play the game. Others reporting the same. I previously had the game installed on an NVME drive.
---
500.that should be the magic number.
---
There are people on here who advise players to rush through wastelanders so they can start grinding gold. Seriously, no wonder people think the game is boring if you just blast through and ignore the actual story, lore, world, etc.
---
If they make this run any easier they may as well just, like, GIVE people the stuff for free.
---
There's no way to predict it. The last couple of nukes I dropped had fights that lasted about 15 minutes. Most surprisingly that wasn't 15 minutes of her crop dusting. People didn't put out tents or stand on top of things so she landed quite often. The benefit of course is that her landings bring on additional enemies. This makes the fight much more fun.
---
I find scout armor to work just fine. Use to run all heavy combat armor. Everyone‚Äôs legendary preferences are different. But I like the all powered mutants sentinel scout armor I have. One piece chameleon powered sentinel, one piece autostim powered sentinel. DR is good. Working on an all powered secret service set at the moment. Got two pieces. Just 3 more to go.
---
There was no sarcasm there. 
---
So what challenges would you not complain about?
---
I skipped that creature one. I dislike NW and there're plenty of challenges I hate but still do... but there is definitly a limit to how much of my time I'm going to let them waste on stupid shit.
---
I also noticed they are doubling and tripling the NW challenges lately already cuz the last creature challenge was only 3 (which I did and it took forever to find them) and then became 9, as well as the last Stimpak one being 3, now it's 6. So that's stupid.
---
It has not been resolved on my end Im over a week out with still not able to play or log in all while missing out on the first season.... 200701-003539
---
Single action revolver and the classic laser rifle.
---
Appreciate you taking the time to find it :) I guess you can call bug reporting "complaints".
---
I use my single action as a stand in for Big Iron. Equally as fun and pretending Clint Eastwood
---
This of course, everybody plays and finds happiness differently! But this is definitely my first and only advice when it comes to gameplay; some players tend to forget the ‚Äúrpg‚Äù next to the ‚Äúmmo‚Äù
---
There should be a hud off mode for playing like this.
---
Nice, good luck!
---
Thank you for that! We're investigating why that is happening so we can implement changes to fix it.
---
NW challenge posts in nutshell
---
LOL! I'll be honest, you had me there for a sec....til the last line! Updoot for you!
---
The hilarious part is when they can free travel to the Scorched Earth event :P
---
Couldn‚Äôt have described it any better
---
Agreed. To each their own, but I've never understood the obsession with fast leveling, speed running, meta/optimal builds, that have enthralled both users and developers. Like, this is a game, for fun, to relax. Its especially weird for fallout. I'm just here to scratch an unexplainable itch to wander derelect highways and rummage for junk!
---
Agree with you about the gauss shotgun, but damn that thing has killed me more times than I care to admit. Sneaking up on a group of Ferals, target one in VATS, target sees me and charges at me as my GS just finishes charging, release trigger GS fires at the Feral at point blank range, Feral explodes into a Bloody Mess, recoil washes over me, and kills me instantly.
---
Might be coincidence, I noticed the opposite.
---
Suddenly my primed BE hm has no more misses and even at 35% it only takes one shot. It's been like this since last Tuesday.
---
So many times I‚Äôm locked into a target with 95+% VATS and it misses. I unselect VATS and try again. So annoying.
---
[Yup!](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6uGykyguCRz6hvvNUhZ5f0/61fd56348e4350f5ca4eb3106752fd13/F76_2020_Roadmap_FULL-SIZE.png)
---
‚ÄúHaha you dead now-oh my god! Dammit Janice!‚Äù
---
I'm not aiming for realism, just believability. In Fallout 1, Rad-X being this absolute radiation shield wasn't really believable, but was the most expedient solution as far as game mechanics went. Now we have hazmat suits and power armor to protect us in the raging radiation storm that nuke zones are supposed to be. And yeah, the problem with the Chinese stealth armor is the separate hood - they really should have kept it as a full-body suit so as to not throw all suspension of disbelief out the window.
---
As for RadShield/RadAway - no you can not stack RadShield to the point where the radiation doesn't quickly overwhelm you - you'd need around 15000  RR to get radiation damage down to 5/s in a nuke zone. Which is why I said that you need to mainline RadShield AND RadAway. Which, given how RadAway works isn't entirely believable either in my opinion - the water loss from RadAway should really be higher. So from my perspective, I'm also for stoping RadShield from stacking with itself, but my aim would be to make sure that PA or hazmat/CSA are the only viable possibilities in a nuke zone, because I frankly don't think that the Commando and Unarmed bloodied builds should have the run of the whole game quite that easily.
---
Also, endgame armor *is* competitive with Power armor. The only place where power armor is indisputably better is inside a nuke zone, and the only play style for it is a heavy gunner tank. Literally any other build, but especially Unarmed and Commando, is better and gives more variability in play style with normal armor and its legendary effects.
---
I can‚Äôt speak for Xbox, but PS4 comes with a earpiece with a microphone you can plug into the controller... 
---
Laptops and other computers probably have them too so I doubt that argument holds much water.
---
‚ÄúYour screwed now *LOSER*‚Äù
---
I'm lvl 1473 with 6k hours
---
You can get addicted to MedX and Psycho and it will give you -20 DR, then you can equip 20 DR and still get the damage boost while taking care if legendary and under armor effects.
---
To do that you need to use lvl 1 legendaries though if you want to equip a full set.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. It seems to me something unique to this Windows/Game Pass version currently. I‚Äôve played 76 on PC during free weekends on both Bethesda Launcher and Steam, and neither time did I have to install on the OS drive. So idk if this is something we gotta hope Microsoft fixes soon or for Bethesda to fix soon, but hopefully it does get fixed soon. I can still play my main on Xbox but have a few PC only friends I was hoping to be able to hop on with
---
Back when drills would drop instead of legendaries.

I got bored and cleared west tek by running through it and drilling knee caps.   
---
It was surprisingly effective.   Especially with the upgrade.
---
I kept the picture because I took it at the perfect time, such a creepy photo that I will treasure forever.
---
Would be great if I could keep it on my other drive. Just barely have the space for it on my C drive.

for me, any two shot explosives i love lmao. i have a tse handmade, minigun, pump, and 10mm and i wouldnt trade any of them ever lol

hes only running in underwear, i mean no underamror at all

I like punching vehicles so hard they explode and somehow don't hurt me.
---
My first colossus was killed by a nuke. I was fighting it and died when 2nd nuke hit. I got my rewards though since I hit it.
---
I would imagine there is gong to be "server maintenance" in the next day so to fix the
---
 dup/ping issue. They might have according not setup disabled till they have a fix.
---
I hear you, my instigating shotgun just missed a full clip at point blank, 95% vats. If you notice that happening, go out of vats and back in, that‚Äôll usually solve it. Sucks but that‚Äôs all you can do until they fix it (if they fix it).
---
leader of the pack yo..
---
I have read this exact same comment a few times now
---
Use a Treasure Map. You'll get lots of stuff to repair.
---
Then why can‚Äôt we massacre both the raiders and settlers? I for one *might* let the settlers off the hook because they weren‚Äôt massive dicks to me.
---
the raiders on the other hand? Their base would be painted red and green from blood and gooified bodies (I have a Plasma Caster)
---
happens to me everytime. usually 2 of 3 creature will be where they are supposed to be but at least 1 them is nowhere to be found. meanwhile I'm stuck with this stupid syringer indefinitely.
---
So this seems to be install related. I'd be curious if it worked if you moved it back to the previous drive (I understand if you don't want to transfer it again as its a massive file.)
---
I've been wanting this too
---
I think there supposed to take a long time. They want us to play for years.
---
Be thankful you didn't get 3 pipe pistols out of 5 exchanges.

Guys I‚Äôm at level 837 with 27,436 hours logged and I don‚Äôt even know what this game is. When do I catch a Pok√©mon? Where are the Witchers? I got a frog down in burger town still trying to crash the street. WHATS EVEN HAPPENING RN

---
It means the people you're all constantly shitting on here on reddit are just community reps with zero actual control over anything that happens in this game.  The absolute most they can and ever will be able to do is note down suggestions or bugs and pass that information on to the people that actually control/program the game.
---
These people exist because you NEED a buffer between the community and the actual developers, people in this position have the kind of training and experience needed to deal with customers while being detached enough from the actual development of the game to not take shit personally.  Just try googling some of the stories out  there of when actual game developers replied to harsh community feedback, they tend to end with formal apologies for behavior or suddenly deleted social media accounts.
---
Disagree. I don‚Äôt use that armor, and it happened to me with my aae rw gat plasma during sbq event. Only happened with that weapon.
---
I feel your pain. It's happened to me twice now.
---
Yeah only tried it once to swap a piece of unyielding armour I had and the dude disappeared after I gave him it which sucks
---
Greatly appreciate that, thank you very much!
---
Dude! I need that weapon so badly! Can I interest you in a legacy? Maybe two?
---
What the hell am I supposed to use man, harsh language?
---
not quite relevant for devs.
---
Just an echo chamber of bitching and quite frankly it will NEVER get resolved because that's all it is. I hope they scrap this game altogether so no one plays it.
---
Make it 3 must include a be2525 fixer and Je gatling plasma
---
Well done! Very good use of space. I feel like I have half as much stuff in my camp and I‚Äôm at budget limit.
---
Then perhaps you have radicool.. I guess the unyielding isn‚Äôt the only factor then, thanks for pointing it out.
---
Is that someone that has a Doctorate in Metallurgy who dispenses sage advice?
---
I run straight to the corpse. Don't care if i die just gimme that legendary loot.
---
It sure is üëç

Oh, a follow-up question! Fantastic!

These are the (non-NW) challenges I won't complain about:

anti armor swing speed pool cue, i like to use it when doing low difficulty events like patrol duty or manhunt.
---
Deal! Just because it‚Äôs an amazing weapon, can I interest you a leather coat? Or maybe even a blue ridge bundle?
---
I wish it had a lobby in general so I didn't have to play "race against the clock to set your perks."
---
explosive flamers

It's a conspiracy,  and I have a theory

exploring is my favorite psrt of the game lol, im level 110 and just finally finished the main nuke questline like a week agoüòÇ

Yeah same, a lot of people have the same issue. I've given up trying solutions and will just see if they patch it.

I can hear when people shoot almost half cross the map
---
Any weapon can be fun. I had an explosive smg that was fun. Pick axe can be cool. I‚Äôve recently learned to enjoy sniping and bows. Xbow is also interesting. 
---
The only weapons I personally cannot stand are Tesla‚Äôs and auto grenade launchers.
---
Nah but 9 is too many.
---
Any enemies really. Sucks when you collect 49 bioluminescent fluid and that last firefly corpse is lost in the weeds.

I‚Äôve used both. Had a aae rw Gatling plasma (now trades). Since I hit ally and got my bloodied ffr lvc gauss minigun, I like the gauss more. The only thing I don‚Äôt like? Is the 2mm ammo issue. Even with batteries included, it weighs a ton, and goes so fast.
---
As long as they don't make one where you have to kill (X) amount of people I'm fine

"Old World Food" like Canned Dog Food, Instamash, etc. are unaffected by Herbivore or Carnivore.

My latest love is the flamer! It's super fun to run around and melt everything. And in my opinion it even does decent damage. 
---
Also it has been extremely fun using Grognak's axe. Nice post-apocalyptic Skyrim-feels whacking the bats with huge axe.
---
my man!
---
I'm still loyal to power armour. Always will be üò¢
---
Well I agree a 1000% if you remember when they first added the mounts they were going to be worth a fortune and could be used as currency as they should but now collecting in FO76 is a thing of the past because vending is a thing of the past. Until the get these cheaters out of the game I will not truly enjoy myself. (I'm a Fallout hoarder and the prospect of vending was a great idea and an even better feeling. Now its so mucked up with the menu lag I and the dupes driving everything into the ground I have not even reloaded my machines since they were "patched"
---
Here here, I wish there was a chat log that recorded this...
---
You wanna join mine?
---
haha for real though. i was watching a certain youtuber/streamer who has a few high level characters and literally said the other night that theyd never done the mistress of mystery quest line.
---
Okay thanks
---
My 3* Furious Shovel has been and will always be my favorite find. I use it EXCLUSIVELY for Buried with Honor. :D
---
If its fine with you then yes please
---
Well that‚Äôs the thing.  I‚Äôd read up on the whole ‚Äòit‚Äôs VATS misses exit and re-enter to get a new random seed‚Äô.  And I‚Äôd seen &amp; done that. 
---
But this feels ... different.   It‚Äôs happening all the time.   Like before I could do the strangler heart mission and just stand in the middle, VATS aim once (mostly) and start pulling the trigger with each hit leveling a mirelurk and the auto-re-aim taking me to the next one.  And Grim Reaper‚Äôs sprint keeping the game going.  
---
Now I‚Äôve done it twice in the last couple days.  With some slightly upgraded equipment &amp; perks even.  And I‚Äôve died multiple times.  (Level 130 character dying easily in a level 35 event #sigh)
---
Heck I went to do the mothman event and some radtoads swarmed me and took me out. :-/

It's no problem!

Sounds like u never tried to fight enemies on low hp :) this shutgun breaks really fast. and i have 200+ repair kits and i prefer to repair on workbench bcz of 200% health bar.

I buy 10 legendary modules whenever is posiible.

It is because I like power armour that I am complaining. It doesn't deserve to be left in the dust
---
You make some well thought out and reasoned points and I appreciate it, I don‚Äôt want to break the game - just want to have a bloodied handmade for my unyielding character who‚Äôs rocking the communist skin and have some fun running around shooting things üëç
---
Sweet, what's your gt? I'll add you
---
Speaking from experience, I have over 5k ultracite 2mm, and over 12k standard 2mm. With batteries included, it still weighs a shit ton. At one point, I had over 35k 2mm. And I couldn‚Äôt get out of my power armor (with calibrated shocks) without being over encumbered.
---
Why not dupe it and share the love :-)
---
Loads of the NPCs swear...but I can't get a middle finger emote? Thbbt.
---
Yeah, we need some kind of buffs all around
---
Yes I noticed this.  I can't help but wonder.  Methinks they put NW challenges in the game thinking not many people would do them and would buy atoms instead.  Then they saw that a lot of people were actually doing it, and then they increased the creature kill to 7, and the stimpak  use to 6.
---
Love you
---
[You‚Äôre welcome. ](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/469)
---
Mhmmm :)
---
I have recently got hooked on the Slug Buster plasma rifle changed over to a plasma flame thrower.  I love this thing.
---
It also has extended the life of my game because of my endless junk search to keep this thing fed.
---
I want to try a Junkies legacy version to see what explosions do with the plasma thrower mod.  I also think I will like flame throwers so I am hitting Mama Murgh's sale right now praying for a legendary to try out.  She is being her typical self and giving noctornal pump shotguns and pool cues though.
---
Ooh I do like the blue ridge caravan items
---
Reviewers scramble to get out their reviews asap, to get the clicks, not having the time to really dive into it. The early bits are decent enough so the game get positive reviews and people  will buy it. Its a new IP... And Beth surely has learned from their FO76 mistakes.  
---
And after a few weeks people hit endgame, caps, limits and people will get more disappointed, but only after selling really well. 
---
Beth will promise to do better in the future, buying themselves another few months of sales, because we want to believe. 
---
After that it will go on sale, so the people that didnt buy it yet, will do so " cuz its cheap enough for a few hours of entertainment". 
---
And then release of total sales numbers to show its been doing really well, getting more income from those that believe amount of sales =quality. 
---
Now for some DLC, promising to fix some of the things that were broken...
---
Or just be the last of us 2 with negative reviews an controversy and still rack up 4 million copies sold because theres no such thing as bad press.
---
What station and pc?
---
Bethesda released the dupe so we could focus purely on the game, score, and getting SS armor... maybe.   The weapon grind is over.... 
---
But really though, to ban everyone would be banning a ton of fallout 1st members. So I don't see that happening
---
There should be a terminal in that room to open the elevator
---
Vanguards, Mutants, powered with a chameleon piece and autostim mixed in with sentinel or Cavalier.
---
I still have room for 2 little objects, hoping i can fit the ammo maker in once i unlock it.
---
No, I‚Äôm not a bloodied build. I‚Äôm a sneak sniper. But one of my friends is a bloodied build, and has a bloodied gauss shotty, and never has a problem with it breaking.
---
All the loot is yours. If the other player do enough damage to the queen they get their own loot same with any other enemy üëç
---
Yeah kinda pisses me off, im in a full event team and say rad rumble comes up, theres another full event team too, I spam the "come here/follow me" emote like one other guy shows up before the start timer is almost 0. Why are you in an event team?
---
I shared about 200 lbs of plans to random people I collect
---
I'd like to see the whole NV soundtrack added as a channel..  miss you much mod makers you guys are gawds
---
For me this weekly auto completed earlier at only 2/3. I didn't notice if I got the 1000 score or not, there is no way to check is there? I know some people claimed to get the score previously even though they didn't fully complete their dailies or weeklies. So frustrating, I was hoping this score system was bug free at least.
---
Loots all yours buddy
---
Any loot container ( whether its a body during an event or a chest whilst exploring) is instanced for each person. So you can loot away without worries üòÑ
---
Not everyone is a god at this game. And I have other games I wish to spend my time on. Gaming is supposed to be a hobby, not a job.
---
Awesome, I figured that was the case but Bethesda gonna Bethesda so wanted to make sure
---
I wish Bethesda could add a way to speed up the process like killing Legendary enemies to get legendary perk coins
---
If I was in the Tops, I‚Äôd bet that we‚Äôll get more military camp items when the Brotherhood comes.
---
15 minutes of mentats I mean
---
If your on Xbox would love to trade you for some materials or ammo or something your after , anytime I‚Äôm too heavy I dump stuff on another charachter because it beats throwing it away
---
Personally, I only do the NW challenges if they take less than 15 minutes. Otherwise I skip it and tally up my missing total to figure out how much I am going to grind XP in the double s.c.o.r.e weekend coming up.
---
I figure if I am going to be earning score, I am going to earn it doing what I enjoy.
---
Depending on your level, Whitespings and a ghoul slayers switchblade....
---
The grind is addicting....which is why I‚Äôve switched to games that I can take a break from without missing a ton of content, like State of Decay 2 and No Mans Sky. I get my grind fix, but if it starts to get monotonous like all grinds sometimes do, I can step away for a bit without worry.
---
&gt; Including NW for 1 daily and 1 weekly challenge is a really cynical ploy to get people to buy atom shop gear, 
---
I thought it was more a cynical ploy to get people to buy atoms to advance on the legendary board. 
---
I can't help but wonder. Methinks they put NW challenges in the game thinking not many people would do them and would buy atoms instead. 
---
The first challenge was to us a simpak 3 times.  Today it was use a stimpak 6 times.  Methinks they put this in the game thinking not many people would do it and would buy atoms to advance instead. Then they saw that a lot of people were actually getting it done, and then they increasaed the stimpak use to 6.
---
Putting in a score challenge that people are likely to skip increases the likelihood that they will buy atoms to make progress.
---
I love how when you bring back one of the items hell maybe got 10 others but cant afford to lose one more or we ever actually needed to use this before.
---
I'm like "A man is dead!!!"
---
Just chill and enjoy the experience and be careful out there in the wasteland
---
The only feedback they will truly listen to is when you don't play and don't pay. Play the game as long as you're having fun. Drop it when you're not.
---
&gt;To do that you need to use lvl 1 legendaries though if you want to equip a full set.
---
You can use high level armor, you just have to have a friend shoot you with an explody weapon until it all breaks. The DR goes to zero but you still benefit from any legendary effects as long as you don't take it off.
---
As a dev on a project unrelated to Fallout 76, I know part of the reason for the existence of daily limits is risk management.
---
You ask:
---
&gt;Did no one ever consider that all these stupid exploits and glitches happen so much because the RNG, CAPS and Limits in this game
---
This is not true. Exploits and glitches will happen anyway, regardless of those limits. Good programming can slow them down, but there are too many users in the world doing random shit, and Fallout is too complicated a game to believe they can be removed completely.
---
The key difference is, **daily limits prevent those glitches from totally destroying the economy**. Or, if you're a pessimist who believes the F76 economy is already destroyed, the limits buy the dev team time to make a fix before things get a ton worse.
---
Compare Diablo 1 and 2. The online economy makes absolutely no sense to someone coming from single-player because it's been so warped by the presence of cheaters.
---
I have no idea what is wrong what is not. if it says so and it isnt = bug. I made this post bcz there is a legal way to duplicate at least what u craft and it is not workind as intended while a lot of chetears get banned for doing this illegally.
---
Don‚Äôt forget [The Legendary Run Roadmap](https://imgur.com/gallery/4CJWu5n) has all the upcoming events (Meat Week, etc)
---
Add a cap sink(that is actually useful) that doesnt have a weekly limit and caps should greatly increase in value.
---
Oh their is a cap. When they have that amount of items it flags the account for cheating. When ban  waves come that‚Äôs part of the pool that goes. It‚Äôs why you see people bitch in here about ammo amounts getting them banned. Then theirs certain caps of things like christmas presents that people can consume before it flags them. When secret service stuff came out people were getting banned for having duplicate patterns. The part that baffles me is that legendary- power armor,rings and shootable binoculars goes unchecked. Not to mention the latest legendary dupe being so easy anyone can do it. Any other multiplayer game would have it hotfixed out in hours at worst.
---
I have first &amp; do about the same thing. Have u found anything to make the loot more favorable? I have a little thing I've been doing but I'm still testing &amp; can't prove the data yet
---
I love my full set of unyielding SS armor. It may not all be 3\*, but it really takes the kick out of a lot of damage from high level enemies. Would highly recommend you get the full SS set.
---
When I was on one of my alts level 20. I built this huge wooden mansion until one day I pvp at the Dirt Track workshop and my mansion was too close and it got destroyed by exploding mini guns. Thought it was hilarious until I saw the repair cost: over 1000 wood üòë I had to move.
---
‚ÄúNo no, not dead.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh this is bad.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNonono, this just a big misunderstanding.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh this is worse than when she brought the deathclaw.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not helping.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThere were eight of us then‚Äù
---
We don't need any of the brotherhood items for our camps. Bethesda needs to grace the atom shop with the glorious Enclave
---
Yup, this is very frustrating and happens to me constantly. As mentioned in the comments, exiting vats and going back in seems to help, but it‚Äôs not perfect.
---
They also said 1-2 hours of normal game play for a score level. I do not think that is true or at least it is not for me. If public events gave score then maybe that would work.   
---
Feels like a grind and not fun.
---
I would never sell Bethesda's cynicism short, given their performance since Wastelanders launched. You could very well be right
---
Shhhh...
---
There‚Äôs a Reception Terminal that shows messages.
---
Everyone seems to have this ID card and I do not and it doesn‚Äôt point me to any ID card. Is my quest bugged?
---
Anything beararm.  You just run at stuff and punch it. If you like killing stuff it's hard not to have fun with it. Just run and punch. Once leveled up you can achieve about 30,000 damage currently.
---
Well the double edged sword part of Junkie is it works with pretty much any build...I‚Äôm primarily a VatsCritDmg/Rifleman but I swap in shotty/heavy/melee perks for fun.  The downside is there aren‚Äôt many Junkie centric perks
---
Me right here. I collect real life nick-nacks of Fallout. Started selling them after Fallout 4 didn't do it for me like I thought, and FO76...just, no. :/
---
I now dread the day of Fallout 5. I hope my expectations are met.
---
Have you seen it get worse since the last patch?
---
To fix the death traps they could offer a return to previous location option if you die within 30 seconds of spawning and not drop your scrap.  Or spawn protection when its someone's base and not a game location or event. 
---
 Something like that may help alleviate the issue.  I don't know what the issue is for people. Lost Scrap? Damaged Armor?  Dying?
---
Yeah, they give us these endless skins for PA. Yet PA itself gets no love at all...
---
Or u can use level 1 as it‚Äôs easier to obtain and cheaper to buy and you don‚Äôt have to faff around breaking it.
---
No thanks, I don't want to be maybe, possibly, eventually, hypothetically temp banned/perma-banned/slapped on the wrist/put in the effort...? HMU in game, IGN: Nukathulhu. I have an extra Legendary shovel :D
---
A man of true culture
---
the goal should always be fun, not realism.  They just need to nerf the efficacy of healing and remove healing stacking entirely.  
---
It all needs to be looked at together.  legendaries, legacies, teslas, healing, those are the main things.  to a lesser extent you also need to look at stealth boys and vats though imo those are less important problems.
---
I still chortle when I hear that damn sound. Every. Time.
---
Inventory lag is real. I took some advice from another Redditor and removed nearly all of my notes and holotapes from my Stash and I noticed an instant difference once I reloaded. Maybe the advice can help you too!
---
Good question. I doubt it works based on the fact that you can't exploit the magazine perk cards that way (I've tested that), but knowing Bethesda who the eff knows.
---
Right, that‚Äôs how it usually went with the quiet teams I previously joined. These guys I‚Äôve been playing with we‚Äôve been hopping into events together, I mean I even got to kill my first Colossal Wendigo last night with them
---
How is this even considered stressful?
---
Most people wear 5 armour pieces and have at least 2 weapons - that's 7/10 done in normal play if you repair items as you play anyway. 
---
And you have 24hrs to complete it. Even if you only play a couple of hours a day it should be no hassle at all.
---
What a worm. Living under a rock asking these dumb questions. Pay attention and you wouldn't have to ask such stupid questions. Human filth pile.
---
I would love the music at Big Al‚Äôs (alcohol daily) in the Jukebox.
---
Yeah, like the group posts on Xbox
---
It's the rubber banding health that does it for me
---
Finding decent level 1 legendary stuff is actually fairly hard (or it used to be) because high level players were willing to over pay for good gear for their alts.
---
I think to the 3rd point in your edit, deep down you already know the answer to that question. That‚Äôs why you haven‚Äôt received clarity. They want to keep engagement in their game as much as possible. Setting daily strict limits keeps that engagement. That‚Äôs my theory, but the answer they could provide obviously isn‚Äôt going to be one we‚Äôd like to hear. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt tell us. At the end of the it‚Äôs a business, you want to keep people with this type of game grinding as long as possible.
---
Yes!  I just posted about this earlier today!  Everyone should get onboard and maybe it will happen. :)
---
Its not considered stressful. It's wasteful. I rarely do 10 repairs even in a week.
---
Sure, IGN JimmyRiddle01 on PC I assume
---
I'll add tesla rifle - the electrical arc and ability to fry several low level enemies at once makes me smile every time.
---
I'll second the boxing glove (I used a bloodied one all throughout Fashnacht - it's now in my vendor ;) and a plasma gun with flamer barrel and pulse capacitor.
---
And why is that surprising? You can get the first achievement sometimes in 5 minutes, even with fresh lvl 1 account, while the other one requires a two month grind and completing lenghty storyline.
---
I don't know why I'm surprised but I really am at how quickly and thoroughly Beth squandered the goodwill that should have come from the Wastelanders launch. 
---
the time gating stuff is what feels like the biggest slap in the face. It makes me feel pretty stupid honestly for having put so much time into Fallout 76. But it's obviously what they want to do, so I will simply change the nature of my usage of the game. I'll check back in when there's new content. Now a new grind, but new content.
---
I‚Äôve switched my primary weapon to a gauss shotty around the time of the update and it‚Äôs been this way since I‚Äôve used it. Before the update I was using a bloodied handmade and don‚Äôt have the issue with that weapon, even now. So not sure if it‚Äôs weapon specific, perk specific, or just another feature of the update.
---
As in you want to join my private world and you launch a nuke and attempt to solo it yourself. Or you wana just do the SBQ solo without you actually launching the nuke?
---
Well. You can do what I did. Make a new char. Feed it scrip and roll armour. It‚Äôs all level 1.
---
It was honestly ridiculous. 
---
3 creatures? Sure - I can do that on my way through a round (or two).
---
9 creatures? That's me solo queuing a few rounds and playing "Shitty Hunting Simulator" with (ideally) a crossbow at the fringes of the map while hoping I don't run into any players who might get in the way of (or steal!) my varmints.
---
I would do the nuke but I've found someone already
---
Downvote then upvote
---
full set is a uniform and a hat, see [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Responder_fireman_uniform) how it looks.  
---
full set is extremly rare and valuable, dont trade it for some shinys. (with the actual duping wave, sit on it, atm nothing is worth anything)
---
Been playing since beta, casual though, and only level 120. I use the canned stew occasionally, and the odd XP perk here and there, but power levelling is not my thing. (I burnt out on WoW and SWTOR doing that.) 
---
I think Bethesda needs to take note that while FO76 has some seriously hardcore grind fiends (and I tip my hat to them for such commitment) the vast majority of us are fairly loose and easy with our game time.
---
I am not bloodied build ethier. I run with 2 shot gauss shotgun in stealth mode and a mutation allowing me to do more damage at low health. I have  friends too but i rather believe my eyes seing that it breaks damn fast.
---
Chew 35 Bubblegum.
---
I think a weekly timegate would be better.
---
That way people with work lives can still grind balls for a day and still make decent progress.
---
Also they NEED to get rid of the loss from buying things in game.
---
If I give a merchant 300 caps for an item why do they only get 225 caps added back to their reserve?
---
It's stupid and makes only essential items worth buying from the shops since the daily caps cap is also constantly strangling the game economy.
---
Because I've spent thousands on the purveyor and have yet to get a damn rifle I want. All my best weapons came from player vendors. Honestly that's how I play it now. Earn caps and buy off other players. Hell add server hopping to that and in my experience I've had a much better time getting the gear I wanted.
---
On xbox (also probably PC) its on gamepass and its new players trying to be sneaky.
---
Otherwise its probably mule accounts.
---
Something is definitely off. I noticed a while back that I was taking a LOT more damage from pretty much everything than I used to. Given, I wasn't immortal or anything, but I could normally get through a super mutant fight only taking a stimpak or two, three at the very most, now it seems like I'm needing 6+ stims to just survive a moderate firefight.
---
I love the fallout franchise but this lengendary perk system, pay to win atoms bs is getting old. It's getting worse. This " board game thing isnt as bad as I thought but this legendary system is something else. May be time to move on to bigger and better until BOS roll back into the wasteland...
---
Yep Yep, Ill be on later this evening!
---
FO76 (nowadays) is good for a playthrough. Especially in your 30 to 50ies. Until you suddenly run out of (main) questlines. That's it. At that point they could've just made a single player RPG but put more effort into it.
---
Had to check to make sure I was in the safe zone after that comment lol. Luckily I'm in the safe zone, only thing I gotta worry about is the pesky blood eagles that like to hang out by the shipping container up the road.
---
A lemmings themed camp for legendarys
---
I use the Chinese stealth armor for my berserker commando build.  Just stand around and get hit until it breaks. I used the level 1 liberators next to vault 76. You keep the stealth while sneaking, rad resistances, disease resistances and fall damage reduction.
---
Zero VATS isn't a thing anymore, sadly. A few patches ago they adjusted something (I don't recall what), and now all weapons have increased AP usage.
---
However, you can still get it pretty low, but you'll need to go full auto to do so. An automatic receiver is a significant part of the overall AP reduction.
---
This site is outdated, but the fundamentals are correct: https://fed76.info/a/zerovats/. Use those mods to reduce AP as much as possible.
---
I like 2 heavy leather pieces, 2 heavy metal, and a BOS chest plate. The combo is higher than anything pre-wastelanders. IDK if its better than SS, I haven't run the numbers.
---
This was available as soon as I logged in after reset. Boom done.
---
Couple of days ago the Violent Night event popped and one guy was there in a public event team all by himself. So I join his team and fast travel over. Note, the event had not started yet. By the time I zone in, he‚Äôs kicked me out. No message or reason. He stayed for the event and so did I but it left a weird vibe in the air.
---
Cool, let me know when your on, its evening here already.
---
Have a little something for you in return, you'll like it :-)
---
dude just try it out? lol i mean..mentats..they arent..hard..to get
---
Ok thanks, do you think I could trade for deathclaw mask and croc backpack for it?
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Tell us or downvote haha
---
Ive gone through just under 200 nukashine and successfully gotten about 150 of them to use it.
---
Boy, these new players sure love this 100% extra melee damage beverage.....
---
I'm not sure this would work because it doesn't let you pick the folder to install the game to, only the drive.
---
I wish there was a character like smiley where you could purchase a certain amount of scrip per week.
---
https://twitter.com/jg93
---
project lead, people leave feedback on his tweets all the time he just doesn't care.
---
I'm tired of skins too.
---
Cant believe I got it first visit and just got rid of it fml
---
... Is there a difference?
---
&gt;	Let me pretty up my camp! Oh no sorry
---
*Exceeds C.A.M.P. budget*
---
...after spending caps on plans after almost hitting the 30k max üò≠
---
They should make better mods for the arms
---
Fair enough.
---
Have you ever been mistaken for a man?
---
That's a different tactic.  I'm talking about utilizing addictions to avoid doing that.
---
Could you check the number for me :)
---
They're not complaining purely about having to spend more time on certain enemies, they're complaining about it suddenly (without explanation) taking a lot more ammo/effort to kill the exact same enemies they used to be able to one shot/kill easily. It's not a complaint they can't one shot everything, it's a complaint that gameplay/combat has changed for seemingly no reason. 
---
If the game devs meant to change this, they should've announced the change being made. Changes like that happening without announcement just make everyone think it's a bug/mistake. If it was intentional, fine, let us know, but if it's a mistake then it needs to be fixed.
---
I'm a die-hard sneak rifleman since FO4, but lately I've been using a combat shotty in vats and it's crazy good (the gauss is better, but I still like the combat and its easier to get). Maybe find a piece of armor with "reduce damage while blocking by 15%" - at least for now, it amplifies shotty damage in vats for some reason.
---
Nah, did one yesterday where she landed and melted.
---
30 rolls in I got my unyielding chest. 1 Star. I‚Äôve decided I don‚Äôt need the other pieces in the set lol
---
Everything needs to snap to everything else.  That way stuff can sit flush against the wall, cabinets can be in a row, coolers can line up.    
---
GRRRR!
---
Well said.  I enjoyed this game most when I was around lvl 30ish, and combat still had some tension.  
---
Now most of the map feels like shooting up a nursing home.  I'm done until the rebalance, and hopefully that does something about it.    
---
SS Armor?  Why?  Still can't handle nuke zone rads, and PA all plays the same - the stats are pretty much meaningless.  There's no reason to grind this game unless you decide to be the type of gamer that "has to complete everything."    
---
I don't.  The second I stop having fun playing a game is when I log out and find another one.  There's plenty of them out there.
---
Neither Windows 10 nor Gamepass have forced me to encrypt my drive. Are you sure you're not using some 3rd party software that's doing that?
---
I have a bloodied and it was pretty fun to use bit I ended up switching to heavy guns, now I use a bloodied gat and a bloodied minigun.
---
It is fun unloading the full mag with full auto on the railway rifle and watching a pretty beefy enemies drop right before your crosshair hits the sky. Definitely recommend faster reload speed mod and or speed demon though, it does help a lot since the mag is so small on it.
---
Quad harpoon gun is also fun. I really want a Quad Explosive, one day maybe. Lol
---
And here I was giving away my excess clean plans for free
---
Does it pop up on a blue screen after clicking ‚ÄúX‚Äù to log in?
---
Thanks for all the replies guys.
---
F
---
No, the helmet that matches is the white responder fire helmet and both are very rare.
---
Yea I‚Äôve noticed this. Sometimes it‚Äôs the workshop icon, sometimes it‚Äôs just a new icon representing what the workshop does.
---
Fallout 76 has very inconsistent performance. People with worse hardware than me have had better performance at the same settings.
---
Same here. They don't always show up as being owned already either.
---
Yea the lockpicking was real fun...
---
Tell you what. I *do* have a TSE flamer, and that *does* break quickly. And repairing it still only takes two or three seconds with a kit.
---
Keep in mind that steam achievements are really fucky. I literally just got the level 10 achievement yesterday on an alt, despite having leveled my new main right after wastelanders launched. Some achievements don't track, some award at complete random.
---
Well its the stuff of nightmares. Ive only been playing since wastlanders, but I've never seen it
---
Clearly your issue is your armpit. Maybe stock up on some effective deodorants. I use degree sport. It's been clutch on those really warm days.
---
Remember the line of cars in FO3 all broken down on a highway west of Germantown? I used to save the game so I could blow them up over and over. Good times.
---
I‚Äôm at work till 7 7:30 and was hoping I could ask experts that might know more than me.
---
Nope, when you remove the perk you remove the bonus.
---
I can just see the next NW challenge now:
---
* NW Challenge (0/1): Build a fully functional 3 bedroom CAMP complete with bathroom, kitchen, interior lighting, and detached garage, *without* using any blueprints. Must be located in Morgantown and fit visually with existing housing. Once built, you will need to use a flare gun to summon a "Ms. HOA Assessor" robot, a legless Assaultron who will travel from Grafton Dam to judge your dwelling and determine if it fits existing code. PLEASE NOTE: exterior painting and hedge maintenance are considered part of the property assessment.
---
I think you‚Äôll like the prime receiver much more.  The scorch killer receivers are really disappointing.  
---
And hold onto that hunting rifle.  Plenty of players would love that for leveling up an alt.  Great find.
---
They could use the same system that pops up that says ‚ÄòGet Loot‚Äô after you die and drop junk.. just change it to ‚ÄòInspect Legendary‚Äô or ‚Äòcollect Legendary‚Äô or something idk
---
You can change the transparency of the HUD to 0.
---
Gaming today seems to cater to gaming/gambling addictions instead of having fun.
---
Eh worth a shot, I mean mentats giving plus 2 and berry mentats giving plus 5 for longer both would be pretty nice.
---
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
---
I didn‚Äôt even see that autocorrect changed it but I appreciate itüòÇ
---
yeah, some outfits are very, very rare (there are some with a chance of 0,2%) and if you get it at once, you dont know that. its hard to know which one are common and which not...
---
repairing 10 things does not require being a god. 
---
And if you cannot do the battlepass then that's fine. You just get less of the rewards than those who do put in the time. Which is the way it works.
---
It‚Äôs not about having fun anymore, these people are gambling addicts.
---
That's cool, except yesterday I was playing Radiation Roundup and there were about 6000 ghoul corpses that I had to loot before I found the one with the legendary. I don't think the camera would help with that.
---
I'm in the weird minority of people who don't mind the NW ones at all. In my personal experiences they are pretty easy. Usually get them done in 5-10 minutes.
---
No, have you?

lol all good. But in all seriousness, just try and do quests, and find plans. You should be able to at least craft some leather armor to get you started. The first 10 levels or so are usually the most difficult, but you'll start getting your wasteland legs by then and get into a good groove. If you're on PC, I can try and make some gear for you. I'm sure others on the sub will gladly help you out as well.
---
Don't let the apologists see this. They'll tar &amp; feather you.
---
And do  ghoul slayers switchblades grow on ghoul slayers switchblade trees? HUH!!11!111!!
---
Do you have switchable graphics or multiple GPUs? If so, go to your desktop and right click, select Screen settings, scroll down and select Graphics settings. Browse for Fallout76.exe and set it to run with high performance.
---
Okay I may have a fix for you here:
---
Copy the file "Project76.ini" from this folder "D:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps\Fallout 76\" to your "My Games\Fallout 76" folder.
---
Start the Game.
---
Note: The Project76.ini will be on the drive you installed the game on. The example above assumes it was installed on the "D" drive.
---
Once I got medic pump and calibrated shocks, been pretty happy with T65. So far, it‚Äôs not required a lot of repair and the DR is good. I‚Äôm glad I went for it. Am I the meta? Absolutely not. Am I having fun standing nose to nose with SBQ without fear and doing Iron Man landings from high places? You bet. Bethesda could probably do more to help PA, and hopefully they will, but it‚Äôs still a viable build as is in my book.
---
It's getting there. I totally get wanting the game to be better, but at the end of the day no one is making them play it.
---
Haha.........meet me around back.
---
"We'll pass this on to the team" is basically "we'll give you a generic remark to calm you for a bit while we work tirelessly to do nothing at all to improve, as we could care less about all your suggestions and complaints"
---
That's why I like stingwings: Their wings keep flapping after death making them easier to find.
---
It rewards it either way.
---
If its a consistent problem to lose legendaries, and dont mind making the graphics look worse, disable grass. Then use the binoculars like others mentioned. Sometimes you have to be stationary while looking through the binocs for it to display the text at the top right of screen. Its amazing how much easier it is to see mobs and corpses when there is no grass, will also make the game run smoother.
---
Indeed
---
(game just quits and that pops up?)
---
best advice is to check out ps4 cache and rebuilding. I had a similar issue w/ multiple dc and unplayable lag/load times, the rebuild and deleting a lot of older game files solved it for me.
---
I'd like to watch that..
---
Getting down voted lol... yea free exp, they don‚Äôt fight back, and always a modded weapon or armor to scrap
---
Here's my point: PVP IS ENABLED AT LVL 5 SO YOU'RE LYING. PLAYERS CAN'T DIE FROM PVP UNLESS THEY'RE LVL 5+
---
U on ps4?
---
Servers are horrible atm. Damage bug happens constantly where enemies either instantly regen their hp as well as just ignoring some of your shots.
---
My gt is dankilsbyyyy, I'm streaming on twitch
---
Either way? Wdym
---
I really don't think that Todd is involved in system design of the game. Maybe he chimes in on the general story direction, but I'm quite sure he's too high to be involved in designing of the grinds... He seems more like the guy with broad ideas.
---
This guy ü§£ total dick move, and i love it!!!!
---
I mean I could get knocked down and call for help, but there was nobody around except for those two so I just tapped give up and died.
---
Depends on the weapons, only need one with a magic and she goes pop!
---
Yeah because no one has been playing since launch and not a single person has actually earned their legacy right? You are such a toxic piece of shit. They're only "fair game" to you because you're mad you don't have one.
---
They prolly all had not that great weapons I can still solo her so I don‚Äôt think they changed anything
---
A level 20 guy hit me with a pipe yesterday. He started running away when the wanted sign popped up. I pulled my bloodied .50 out and shot 100 rounds into the sky as he was running just to make him poop his pants lol.
---
The dialogue options are inconsequential. The plans are a quest reward regardless.
---
pretty sure they're all gathered around a computer, with beers in hand, reading reddit and having a good chuckle..
---
With our luck, chain reactions wouldn't even count and we would have to blow up each car individually, and chain reactions would block you from progressing and nobody would finish that.
---
yeah thats not how it works
---
I get taking a while but ‚Äî 16 years?? Man that system truly is awful
---
Remember no mans sky.
---
When everyone talks in hyperboles and bombastic accusations, I think that little bit of understatement doesn't hurt...
---
I keep a shovel on for that exact reason lol
---
What? I found it hilarious the first few times and now after 100th time find it pretty cringy.
---
Huh. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all if it is broken in some other way. I hope it all gets fixed soon for both our sake.
---
Idk how much plans are worth on PC but on console don‚Äôt trade it for a DC mask since it can be duped. The dupe doesn‚Äôt work for plans so the safari croc is still extremely valuable. I would personally trade the outfit for the safari croc but to each their own and you can always sit on it if you want.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since launch, and I know where all the workshops are, but the problem I have is that it doesn‚Äôt show you if it‚Äôs currently owned, and by who. I don‚Äôt know what the reasoning behind this change would have been.
---
I don't get 15 minutes anyway, for my berry mentats Chem Fiend makes no difference, does nothing. Probably my character is bugged.
---
This makes a lot of sense.
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs what fucking happened. To be clear, I was level 8
---
Well, one needs much larger dedication than the other...
---
Sure. Never question, even when you are being screwed over. Ya know, for fear of being a Karen. Just bend over and take it. 
---
Good luck in life. Chump
---
Maybe it's dependent on play style?  I tend to go the conflict-avoidant route, running from circle to circle, and I see four to six creatures per map.
---
I have a second character at level 20 if you want somebody to play with. Just message me with your game tag.
---
im sorry but they cant fucking be lvl 2s
---
Yes! Incoming Fastnacht music!
---
&gt;!yes, you get it after the jen +mom room quest. You can craft it to be level appropriate (up to level 50, like all armor, but you can keep doing settler quests and raider quests (picking either side) and still keep the plans if you side against foundation!&lt;
---
Idk I did get something pretty good from her yesterday. I think it's just a gamble every day.
---
I agree! My main just hit level 55 and I‚Äôve had it since launch
---
There was a level 55 Legendary Sheepsquatch around there the first time I went. I figured it was intended to be there
---
Are there any challenges you won't complain about? If you don't want to do it, just don't do it, McScroogeDuck.
---
There should be a snap together toggle for every object that you can build. 
---
Turning it on and off and they need to get rid of the floating/support rule.
---
So you say it's a good idea to implement systems no player will ever use because they don't need them so it doesn't matter they won't even be able to use them? As in, unachievable AND useless?
---
Do you work at Bethesda?
---
From what I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit, this community is nothing but trash, so kudos to Bethesda for ignoring this shitshow.
---
I would use my mic but it's finicky and doesn't work in gc
---
Well that‚Äôs what fucking happened. I know I‚Äôm remembering this right because I remember how fucking hard it was to deal with them because they were fucking swarming me and mauling me to death with a machete and a fucking fire axe
---
I was skulking around everywhere when I was low level, no decent weapon, rubbish armor, was scared of everything.

&gt;How to unlock Fallout 76 PvP and how Wanted Bounties work  
---
&gt;To engage in Fallout 76 PvP, **you need to be level five and above** \- giving you a gentle introduction to the world. It won't take long - for us we unlocked it when we unlocked the story quest to go to the airport.  
---
&gt;From here, you can start fight other players you encounter in the wilderness.
---
I enjoy playing nw as well but during that particular dailey challenge I was more focused on getting the lock picks done instead and my team got wiped out due to it
---
The pipe rev√≥lver rifle uses both rifleman and gunslinger perks, and with that combo will be stronger than a lever action while holding more round
---
Oh i have couple but i don't use them on public servers to kill everything before anyone else has a chance to even tag them. And i'm a piece of shit? Ok. "Yelling at someone over it is a mental issue in my opinion (they need anger management)." Does this mean you need help? Just noticed you name. Never mind. EDIT: Also, there were not many legacy weapons (and i mean explosive energy weapons) around before the nerf to energy weapon came, because they were shit and broke in couple of seconds / nobody used them. They started to appear much later on, months past the nerfs, when the 3rd party spawning programs showed up (software that can spawn any item you can imagine). Anyone who claims their BE15 gatling plasma is legit and they got it as a drop themselves is lying. Right after the nerfs there were very very few crappy rolled ones around on trades (most of them even low level). If you have no idea what has happened in this game since launch keep your pretty mouth shut little missy. Because right now you are just sounding like a ignorant twat.
---
a body at the bottom of a pile is not quite the same thing as one that is lost in tall grass or a bush.. but it will list it all the same...
---
furious rolling... man... imagine the bread that makes
---
That's fine, and as a player who spends most of the time pvping I'd enjoy a no legendary survival mode so long as all the issues in adventure mode pvp are looked at holistically. 
---
That said i feel the game is already close to balanced pvp in adventure mode. A few tweaks and it would be solid.

---
I‚Äôm not lying, this is what happened.
---
Grim reaper is in luck and action boy is in agility. I feel like action boy is a must have for a VATs build. Grim reapers sprint is definitely good too though. I use both. But I have my luck and agility both maxed.
---
I wish they would not have forgotten the enclave as a faction but any additional quests options is a good thing. They might have something yet planned for the wayward though as new quests have been hinted to be in the works. You can only hope.
---
what lvl are you 8?
---
meh.. fake internet points are fake.. lol
---
Those things are nasty MFer‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt feel bad. They‚Äôre extremely tanky and hard to take down until you have good gear around level 50 or beyond. 
---
Never seen one there personally but I have seen high level Radscorpians. They‚Äôre not much fun either in early game lol
---
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have proof, but that‚Äôs what happened to me when I started out
---
Oh. My friend did the quest and said he didn‚Äôt get the plans at the end.
---
diaper dupes, new meaning to the term "deuce"
---
Join a public team that is focused on xp instead of events.
---
Right now I am almost level 31 and trying to get the starched genes perk.
---
Sorry no xb1
---
I feel that there needs to be more more ways to gain rep, it takes to long to get ally with either faction, excluding exploits
---
This is so cool! I like how on theme you kept it. I know exactly where this is too. My camp is on the pond by that train station. Very clever!
---
Ah okay im sorry.
---
&gt;The only way to get max foundation rep is through murder.
---
Is it murder, when they stole the item in the first place? That's more like punishing the thieves who don't want to give it back. They stole it and now have to deal with the consequences.
---
Also, don't forget that to get max out of the Rocksy daily, you need to kill the guy. Personally. Lying about killing him doesn't give the extra rep. When you come back to Ward and tell him that you killed the raider, he shows regret for it. When you tell Rocksy, she congratulates you...
---
While I agree, different people enjoy and play games for different reasons. Some, like you, prioritize the discovery and storyline. Others, like your friend, seem to prioritize the "gameplay" and character/stat/equipment building. No wrong way to play the game.
---
And everyone knows MMOs don't start until you reach max level - everything before that is just a tutorial. /s (but kinda true lol)
---
Rando14 bought 4 rounds .308...
---
Rando45 stole all your serum and legendaries...
---
Rando44 killed you brahmin...
---
Well i'm lvl 100 and i've experienced it all. i think i know what im saying
---
Yeah, this is actually a very good idea! 
---
Giving xp for dmg done to players will reward kill assists and even confronts that you lose.
---
I repair maybe one weapon and armor piece per day. This is dumb. Last time it was only repair 3 btw.
---
What you duping?
---
What do you mean by damage exploiting? Sry for the question.
---
I mean, crazy thing, before the switch to SCORE there was a Kill 12 creatures challenge. Stupid me stayed up until like 4 am trying to complete it lol. So when SCORE came up and asked for 3, I was like, meh, okay. I usually run into one creature per match. This is way better than 12!
---
When I saw 9 yesterday, I was concerned. And yes, it took me many matches to get up to 9.
---
Nah just tryin to make new friends üòÄ
---
It‚Äôs level 4.... it‚Äôs like two days of dailies?
---
Glitch much?
---
THOONK
---
A good possibility was a higher level player was the last to pass thru the area and trigger the enemies. They'll spawn to levels that accommodate in the savage divide, mire, and cranberry bog. If your lower level in those areas there's possibilities you'll be well underpowered.
---
Here's a clip of the community discussing any changes, features, and additions they want for FO76:
---
https://youtu.be/yGsHq-mZI8U?t=72
---
I know that, but I remember that shit almost like it was yesterday because is started like 2 weeks ago. I know what I remember, and I know what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, but I am saying that this is what happened to me
---
Hahaha i wholeheartedly agree. Everyone focused on meta.... Does suggest a lack of balance. I like archers medics survivalist pvp specialists.... Variety. Meta character structures eliminate creativity. Rant done
---
This 100%.
---
They need to have the same number of Adventure and NW dailies and then only allow what is it 6 we have in total.  NW people can do theirs, Adventure people can do theirs, people who like to mix it up can do the first 6 they complete and that‚Äôs it
---
It's been a while since I was to a Vendor and went to inspect an item and couldn't see it? I bought it anyway, the insurgent outfit, it's alright I guess. It would be nice to see what the hell I'm buying, is this a bug?
---
(sits shaking w/ gauss weapon, unable to run,pipboy, map, killed by swarming blood bugs)
---
Same. Do they even know what the fuck is going on?
---
looking for a laggy server to abuse much?
---
Glitchers lagging out servers
---
This. Last night my team and I did the nuclear extraction event and it took about 10-15 minutes. 23 minutes later, we finally located the legendary meat pile that has fallen underneath a cart.
---
Same for the military wing room in Whitesprings Bunker
---
I'm same want to unlock everything travel all over for plans hate that I can't get some unless they drop at events waiting for stimpack diffuser from project paradise and I'm grinding the BOS paint jobs from forbidden knowledge but my toon glitched and ive missed the knight Sargent plan so going to have to start a new toon just for that one or try buy one.
---
Ohhhh then they‚Äôre most likely burner accounts
---
Ward glitched out on me some days ago, I'm so happy - no more fucking godawful fetch quests! Now crater needs to step their game up... can't I just preemptively repair some radio tubes and kill some deserters?
---
&gt;The raiders are the lesser of two evils.
---
Yes. Between Raiders and Blood Eagles, they are the lesser evil.
---
The settlers are far from any kind of evil. Anything bad about them is their mistrust. And can you blame them? They come to this uninhabited land and suddenly the raiders move in too and start stealing from them... I wouldn't trust some random guy who waltzes into my settlement either.
---
That's just the thing,they've got me hooked. That along with the fact that the other games I play stutter so bad that it's a toss up as to whether I'd have an amazing session or a depressing one where my game freezes as I round the corner on the enemy. Surprisingly 76 has them beat in that category
---
I don't so I guess I am clean!
---
The Mole King!?
---
Is Bethesda going to look in to this
---
I actually would like to play this way but it's just not rewarding enough. I kill 5 players, run out of stims and next confront i.'m dead.
---
Back to
---
 main menu - loading screen - vault 51 - loading screen
---
I just finished 3rd in a match by crouching naked in a bush. And my bad luck was that the Scotch beast decided to attack me. Would it attack other players i might had finished first lol
---
No detail, but there are some way to glitch your damage output so they are much much higher than intended.  
---
(And I am not even talking about legacy weapon)
---
Hitting 30,000+ damage per swing, that kind of stuff
---
Yeah I‚Äôm leaning more towards a shotgun build, I‚Äôm at L20 right now so I have a ways until I really build it but finding the weapons is the hard part.
---
Search Fallout 76 magic weapons on YouTube or google
---
This is what I do too easy kills 3 in a row
---
"Not fun" fact, gameplay wise
---
This seriously need to be a thing.
---
Jesus, don't remind me. So many mounted plans, I doubt anyone would buy them but I still have them so I feel the pain of having them from you.
---
Never understood that. Think about how long these games take to make and are still being made essentially. It's not going anywhere. I'd like to quote a certain teenager who perhaps should of gone to school that day. "If you don't stop and look around once in a while. You could miss it."
---
I read something about vaults. I had assumed this would be the best way to do this before. Allow us to build our own vault with the entrance at our camps.
---
Probably bad dps on the server. 
---
Queen still melts. Launched 6 nukes yesterday across 2 of my chars and our typical crew was melting the queen within 2 landings.
---
Why on Earth are you using the most expensive ammo in the game for this.  If you can't afford to use it all the time then don't to use your fucken head
---
Yeah, many do, but not all. I prefer a high health tank build suited for PA, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone. It really comes down to picking the build that best suits your style. I know what the preferred metas are, and I totally get why they are popular, but I don‚Äôt think I could enjoy the game having to manage my health that carefully. I‚Äôve been a stealth sniper in every in every Fallout game I ever played because it worked so well. But I never considered how boring I was making my play throughs. This is the first in the franchise to legitimately challenge me to try something new, and there‚Äôs a certain reckless fun I‚Äôve found being able to hard charge into danger. Find the fun, and the ideal build will follow.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen an INT team in days. It‚Äôs actually infuriating. I‚Äôve even seen LUCK teams, smh.
---
Lol, stop getting shot. That's how the game works. If you're not just sleeping guys with a short burt's of bullets or like 1 or 2 shots, you're not properly perked. Make sure you have damage numbers on, or you'll have no idea what's going on damage wise.
---
I bought 1 arrow for 1 cap, we both got the SCORE.  I thought this was a great together challenge.
---
It's not that they are glitching the weapons, it's just that certain weapons are bugged and it makes them work this way. The people with them don't have to do anything but use them
---
Yeah last night a couple of 150s started raiding my vendors so I left the world as fast as possible then loaded up a new one
---
Damn really? I just assumed it was just from stuff like anglers,stingwings,mirelurk queen's and radscorpions. I guess I'll count myself lucky that one of my 2 pieces has it
---
Anyone can do this with no bugs, exploits or glitches
---
I do this many times during a run. I'm sure I annoy people around me too when I find a decent group of vehicles to explode. Oh well I still enjoy it. lol
---
Can barely give them away
---
They are making so much money and getting attention. They let this stuff run its course to keep interest and players in their game.
---
I try to give new players treated brotherhood suits, stims, a modded 38. Pipe rifle and ammo. It‚Äôs like pulling teeth though. Just sit still and take the free stuff im trying to give you! ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
That's a genuine problem with their fundamentals that I doubt they'll fix anytime soon
---
There'll be some chinese military themed objects coming with Update 21 like a Chicom bunker, fence or fusion generator.

no need to graduate MiT to understand it's not intended.
---
Bonjour! But no not at the moment, sorry.
---
It's a level 5 event you can use your fists
---
Oh I'm sorry you must be confused with the ammo converter. I'm talking about the thing that makes ammo, the one you get from doing the raider quests. Two different things... unless I must be mistaken?
---
It's advisable to keep Jen's mum alive for reasons unrelated to the stealth suit - I think there's a Charisma check involved - but IIRC the quest rewards the crafting plans regardless.
---
I'm brand new, just picked it up through gamepass, just enjoying exploring. Certainly a big difference to me, seeing others.
---
You need to be level 35+ and get a minigun (modded for higher fire rate) with one of the 7 magic effects, they cost 500+ caps (most are less as the effects are useless for general gameplay) and then you won't need to worry about getting in damage. Shoot her as much in the air as you can so the 3 hit melee guy can't do his thing before you can.
---
including the pertinent information along with the joke will inevitably help people whos head it goes over in the first place..
---
also.. I tend to use a weapon im not speced into that uses different ammo from my mains to conserve ammo and wear on my main weapons.. its a fun way to use guns I would never otherwise carry...
---
Thanks for the info. And ugh. Here I thought I was doing well lmao. Guess I need to work on those darn NW challenges after all
---
Done both! Turbo Fert FTW!
---
Just be nice to them both.
---
Dont.
---
That‚Äôs what you fucking paid $60 for in the first place bud. 
---
Go back to Bethesda and tell them if they want more they need to make a new game.
---
Using in game perks, buffs, and mutations that aren't bugged is not intended?
---
lol, no :D  
---
just sayin that its not supposed to have 6 legendary perks fully maxed. pick the one your build really needs and max it. have a frosting with some other 1 or 2 star legendary perks. sounds good to me.     
---
this game is played in so much different ways, every perk will be used by someone somehow, on lower tiers and thats fine. why must everything always be maxed out? tbh, i really like the idea, that its impossible to max out, frees you in some kind.
---
What do you need to do for that achievement? I've stood in the center of a nuke zone before, I stood inside the zone when the nuke dropped so that it killed me, and I still haven't gotten it. Do you need to be literally hit in the face by the nuke as it comes down?
---
It's still there, it just requires more exp. Keep playing.
---
My first time there I had to sneak by one and quickly hit the elevator buttons, I knew it was a random encounter but considering  I hadn't seen one there since wastelands I just thought they removed that specific encounter spawn
---
 Edit:typos
---
You can pick up scrap anywhere and everywhere in the wasteland to do the repairs. It's complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
Have you tuned into the top of the world radio broadcast yet? Until you complete roses mission to restore the bandit key fragments you cant progress the vault 79 story.
---
You should get the glowing skeleton way before that. I unlocked that last
---
I have seen one spawn a couple times on the opposite end where the ski lodge is (down the hill where the mines are).  I also saw it as a lower level and was unable to kill it.  I thing it‚Äôs a random encounter area
---
Why even ask this question if you're just going to refute what someone says?
---
They've been getting better recently but they've still got their age old ideology that they have to have the good shit behind a year's worth of grind especially with this new legendary perk system coming back in a few months. Yh they upgraded the perks so they're actually worth while but they're going to be inaccessible to a massive amount of the community so that the top 5% of players actually get to use them and at that point they hardly need more buffs
---
thats a good point with the plans, havent thought about it.
---
This and yet Bethesda is in complete denial of it. All they can say about it is that "it just works". The real reason though is cause they have a very easy to use dev kit for the engine so they don't have to hire skilled and experienced programmers which amounts to cheap cheap labor.
---
I totally agree I‚Äôve been saying something similar for a long while. I just don‚Äôt understand the systems here and having level be the only non capped recourse makes less sense to me, stats no longer go up past a certain threshold, enemy‚Äôs also stagnate at a certain cap, weapons also cap at a point, but levels never do. 
---
I like having a moniker of time spent or whatever but it doesn‚Äôt service anything. And as for a game based on groups and or solo play or the quick change between the two. the foundation of cards is a nice idea but it‚Äôs completely fumbled with its execution. Like changing in and out should be possible but having it take 10 minutes to slot cards in to make a proper build for a group is ridiculous, and being locked into the basic special structure without an easy way to adjust is also nuts, say you find a group you want to continue playing with? We‚Äôll spend 50 levels to readjust to make yourself worthwhile, oh they don‚Äôt play anymore? Alright another 50 hours or levels to transition back to your normal build. Or even if you just want to change the way you play since weapons and armor are so rng heavy, it‚Äôs like great I found a good gun well I could sell it(but I‚Äôm at caps cap so that‚Äôs a complete waste, I could hold onto it but I‚Äôm already capped at stash so there‚Äôs no point to that) since I‚Äôm a melee build or spend another 60 hours working my way to use one gun and then another 60 if it isn‚Äôt working well. It‚Äôs just none of these systems service the player. I like all the building materials and items and I get that that portion of a game has a cap but where are some new weapons and not skins? 
---
Then we get to the season pass which I was excited for but I was moving apartments the first three days and now that I see how it works I‚Äôll never be able to get to the end of it without filling for a divorce and only playing this game. And for what? What‚Äôs the endgame here what are we actually working twords? What does any of this stuff mean? Like in wow or other mmos you see some armor and you go damn that‚Äôs hard to get he did a good job, here that almost literally translates to ‚Äúoh he has no life outside of this, or he spent money‚Äù there is just no challenge and I get that you don‚Äôt always need that to enjoy the game I mean effectively this is apocalyptic animal crossing but even still i can‚Äôt build anything else in my camp without destroying parts of it and several items I paid actual money for can‚Äôt be scrapped due to bugs that have been present and reported months and months ago. It just feels like they have no direction or someone pulling strings is directing them elsewhere and it just hurts cause I do love this game and it‚Äôs community, I just don‚Äôt know why whoever‚Äôs in charge doesn‚Äôt seem too.
---
explosive bow, just for launching bodies into the distance
---
I‚Äôm melee and can 4-5 hit her without exploiting, I try and let people who don‚Äôt really do dmg get a few hits first but some of us farm queens and like killing her fast
---
There's been some people losing licenses to games, hopefully it's not that but it might be.
---
Omg when I first got ported as a newbie it took me days to get back.  Overweight and so new.  
---
That‚Äôs mean. But funny too.
---
That's the one.
---
I upvoted you for balance
---
Yes it's without bugs or glitches, but it's absolutely an exploit, and clearly should not function as it does
---
I‚Äôm guessing you mean unbalanced. It‚Äôs It‚Äôs all just rng, sometimes you‚Äôll find the best gear and sometimes you find a pipe pistol and wood armor. I think NW is very fair since everyone starts out with nothing but the clothes on their back, some people just play more so they‚Äôre going to have a slight edge since they‚Äôve earned more perk cards.
---
Even so, I don't want my CAMP locked behind a loading screen :/
---
While I agree with you that the gauss shotgun is overpowered and that nw as a whole could be more balanced, I feel inclined to add that the game wouldn‚Äôt be a pvp survival mode without scary things to go up against. Most players who use the gauss shotgun or, say, a missile launcher or an automatic grenade launcher, lack the skill needed to avoid damage and fight in a tactical way. I‚Äôve been one tapped by all these weapons and I‚Äôve also killed the players using these weapons multiple times. My best advice is just to find a play style you enjoy and to not get too angry when you lose a fight.
---
26 without any NW. also, wasnt able to start the actual challenges.
---
That is an absolutely fantastic idea. That would give me something like 15% of my budget back. It would also be cool if you could do it with weapon displays, where the weapon would become part of the display until the display is scrapped. It would also lighten the load on stashes considerably. Absolutely love it. 
---
I very much doubt bethesda would do something like this (especially because having people pressed for stash space encourages fallout 1st memberships), but this sounds like a really great solution to the stash problems that displays create.
---
My mom forces me to play it everyday, mole man
---
38 my dude and feeling good.
---
Now, the REAL grind begins. 2k score a level already, so double the beginning ü•∫
---
secret service w/ jet pack, just for the "wee" factor
---
Sorry mate, that's the duping ban code.
---
It is a prebuilt structure. Go over to miscellaneous on your camp mode
---
im only 27 without nw
---
I mean it's sort of naive to assume that this isn't a beta test for implementing a pay battle pass because that's exactly what it is.
---
Why don‚Äôt you play nw?
---
I put all my plans for 5 caps, no matter how rare it is. If I don't need it and you do, have it for almost nothing.
---
I unlocked all the other Halloween rewards consecutively but  was surprised to see the Fur lined jacket and jeans pop up, hopefully I can still unlock it.
---
Happens to me from time to time. What usually works as a fix for me is to load up a different online game and let it fully log in to its game servers. Once loaded I close and relaunch fo76. 
---
Give that a try.
---
i didnt think to look at that section ive found it now thank you! i got worried for a sec haha
---
that + fasnacht masks (or monster mash mask) makes for wtf moments
---
I mean... Have you ever played an online game before?
---
How? i thought i was doing good with my 27 ranks );
---
I had no idea this was rare.  I thought it was part of the fire breathers questline?
---
Also, is it me or is the Atomic Shop missing? Or is that part of the server connection issue?
---
Np. I didn't know where to look when I first got it either!
---
The log cabin is prebuilt it‚Äôs all the way at the end in the misc. tab of the build menu.
---
13 or 14 
---
I have been playing normally.. Im not trying to complete any challenges intentionally, in fact I have only glanced at the list a couple of times..
---
most of the time I have no clue what the challenges are unless I see someone complaining in a thread here...
---
-ETA: I also started playing a few days after it went live because I was bummed about Adrenaline being borked.. I didnt start right away...
---
24. I started 3 days late :( But I‚Äôve done every challenge possible so far.
---
"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.‚Äù ‚ÄîShigeru Miyamoto
---
the ss armor also has a fun jetpack, just for rocketeering when the time comes
---
It's not rocket science:
---
* Games as a service have never ending development costs.  In the old days MMO's offset those costs with monthly fees. 
---
* But then some enterprising businessmen realized if you make a game fee or just a 1 time fee instead of a monthly fee, you can still monetize the game with "micro transactions" within the game in some sort of "premium store" and make as much money as the MMO's do (or in some cases, more).
---
* In order to get those premium stores to make money you need to make sure players log in as often as possible.  This has been tested and verified to be NECESSARY to maximize income.
---
* Games that fail to get players logging in daily do not earn more revenue than they cost to support, because they don't generate enough micro transactions.
---
All of the systems in the OP are merely there to insure you, the player, are motivated to log in each and every day.  That's it.  It will never change, unless they switch to a monthly fee.  Only then, could there be no limits on all the things.
---
I can jump in now! Ill add you and we can go from there!
---
I sell them for 1000-1500.
---
It's a bug, I think it's only visual and doesn't actually take your caps either.
---
I‚Äôve been noticing an absurd amount of 95% vats shots missing. Talking three or four misses consecutively. If Bethesda wants to make vats less accurate, fine. Just give me the real probability of landing the shot.
---
Wait you gotta pay to fast travel to your own claimed workshops now?
---
This ugly thing is worth all of that ? Why ?
---
What‚Äôs the psn name? Like to check out your vendor later.
---
I had to compromise my vision for my Dunder Mifflin camp bigtime because of budget, even shrinking the building from three floors to two and making the warehouse more of a storage room :/ I'd love to have even 25% more budget to expand back to the original size I had in mind.
---
‚ÄúStop getting shot.‚Äù Lmao that‚Äôs the most ignorant response ever. I‚Äôve been playing FO76 since release and NW on and off. And now, I have an incentive to actually play NW. No, the fact I can laser somebody with a 50 cal and get at least 20 shots in, and he still lives to one shot me with a gauss shotgun? That‚Äôs fucking ridiculous.
---
You‚Äôre an ignorant ass.
---
Also pretty ignorant of you to assume ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not properly perked.‚Äù Do you assume everybody that says NW is unbalanced is just completely oblivious to perks and attributes? Just shut up man.
---
It means "it just works."
---
28, also without NW.
---
Cool gimme 5 to grab something, I'll join you
---
I figured it was some sort of bug, but it puts my mind at ease knowing it doesn‚Äôt actually take your caps.
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
Its a post nuclear war world baby! Everything can grow on a trees!
---
the repair challenge fucking sucks! i only find shit that is over 100% durability, like what the fuck?!
---
thank god i managed to find enough in my stash to do that god awful challenge!
---
At one point it was among the rarest outfits in the game.
---
Rare outfit drop from an event.
---
haha livestreams in dev-godmode
---
No Mans Sky got good with hard work from the devs. There‚Äôs an argument to be made that FO76 still isn‚Äôt a good game and there‚Äôs nothing in sight indicating that it will get a lot better soon. The team is understaffed and every new thing they add breaks. I love this game, and would love to see it become something truly great, but I don‚Äôt know if that is possible with the engine and dev team
---
There's a very easy to do glitch with the retirement plan daily to get max raider rep in one day. Kill the raider who left and then tell Rocksy that Appalachia has a new corpse. Spam the cancel button as soon as you say that to back out of the conversation and you can keep telling her the same thing over and over for a small amount of raider rep.
---
Agreed, sometimes I get a sale while I'm in a load screen; I can hear the noise but by the time the load screen finishes loading the message disappears instantly and I have no idea who bought what. Also, when somebody buys something from me, I like to journey out to their CAMP and buy something in return, so this information is legitimately useful to me. A "log of sales" would be a great idea.
---
Junkie build use junkie weapon. Bloodied use bloddy weapon. Insta guns are always nice to keep.
---
On way :-)
---
Maybe one of the YT content creators could make it happen for science. ;)
---
I don't know, I think i looks like crap. It was a rare item. I had 2 western outfits and a guy bought them off me, later I went to his camp and he had them for sale double the price I was asked for.
---
PS4. Usually the closest station. Often Whitespring.
---
I saw another player do it too.
---
Long live the Enclave!
---
So you want a perk coin for every walk around Whitespring or SBQ. That would be ridiculously easy for anyone
---
I love it when the notifications stop working and you only hear the jingle and see you got X amount of caps and have no idea what was bought.
---
Log out and in fixed it for me
---
wow, how many hours to do all that?
---
I see people complain about the caps all the time. I do not get it. Yes the limit of daily could be increased but it's there for a reason. 1. The servers could not handle a ton of people getting a ton of caps all the time. 2. If you have no cap then you can get an unlimited number of caps at any time. If you find a way to exploit that to get thousands of caps in just a minute or two you have made the game meaningless. Fast travel everywhere and miss out on a lot because why not? Buy everything in the game from every vendor because why not? Have unlimited crafting supplies from the vendors bulk stuff because why not? Use those supplies to fortify a workshop so only you can use it because why not? Use it to get unlimited gold bullion from the wayward guy because why not? See where I am going with this? All of that can be done in 24 IRL hours if there is no cap. To clarify The cap could be higher but they can not make it unlimited.
---
Imo when a SB is in the air it doesnt really do much damage.
---
Thanks, man. I'll try that! One of my friends just installed the game for the first time and is having the same issue. Very odd, but I appreciate the help!
---
I thought they were pretty common now, it's fairly easy to get the Western and the Western with Chaps from the Pleasant Valley claim tickets..
---
When you see blue location icons instead of workshop icons, it's a bug. And it does not use your caps (you clearly don't hear the caps being taken away, and they are not).
---
I'm pretty sure the head of "the team" is the Cash Cow.
---
there was crossplay advertised?
---
Yeah just do daily challenges for either faction
---
Imagine the uproar if Kill A Player in NW score challenge appears.
---
I mean, doesnt excuse that bug in anyway but...wtf were you thinking grabbing loot from a workshop and not stashing it before going to a pvp event?!
---
What a great idea! A few weeks ago, I finally got my friend to play with me. He was like a level 5 and I was 90 or so. He said he needed water so I said ‚ÄúHere drink this‚Äù and he was like ‚Äúuhhh, it‚Äôs changing colors‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúYup‚Äù and then just acted normal until he teleported haha. Luckily it only brought him near Camp McClintock, not anywhere too scary.
---
Thanks, man! I'll give that a try ASAP.
---
Hey I‚Äôm part of that .06%!
---
I got allied with Foundation weeks before Crater.
---
dont like pvp. tried it once, fresh off the vault, got busted after like 4 minutes and thats it, never tried again.
---
32. Only done about 4 NW challenges, but have done  all the rest.
---
I use 2mm EC and can 1 shot things...you must be using the 2mm EC black hole gun!
---
I have been around Whitesprings golf course but today was the first time inside and around the resort. Someone set off the cars, actually the one I was standing on. I got off and away to watch the chain reaction fireworks. It was impressive.
---
Oh the naive mind the entry price doesn‚Äôt cover the cost of things nowadays, especially an online game. Hence why they all do micro transactions
---
Weird, as I'm kinda new to the game. Hopefully I can sort it out.
---
the 10mm pistol could make for an interesting Vats Pistol build.
---
The bloodied handmade, even at level 35, can probably carry you for a while as automatic or standard 
---
the laser pistol i‚Äôm thinking would need to be converted to a rifle to be most useful, but meh
---
personally I‚Äôd focus on the 10mm or the bloodied for now, and upgrade as you can
---
So I can finish the final mission and still earn reputation and get rewards for both factions?
---
1. Do not scrap legendaries! Instead, exchange them for modules.
---
2. You can check how much your weapons are worth on this page. [https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/)
---
Something like berry mentats just for dead enimes not alive ones
---
Wonder how that happened, as I kinda just started my F076 journey.
---
I said something similar a few days ago and had someone reply to me saying that when rushers blast through content stupidly like that, it's Bethesda's fault that new content doesn't somehow FORCE THEM to replay the old content at a slower pace.
---
I didn't even reply.  That's so monumentally stupid.  It's not Bethesda's fault that you put the pedal to the floor and ignored everything except the quest markers/objectives, stopping for nothing.  It's not their job to force you to play it a different way when they add new content either.
---
We can only dream of a unofficial patch mod
---
That's a long rant about a game you don't wanna play, when all you have to do is Just... not play it
---
I keep finding the suitcase in watoga full
---
See i have a harder time being IN power armor than out of it. My max weight with all my deep pockets is 360, in PA with calibrated shocks it‚Äôs like 335. Either way, yeah it would be nice if at LEAST 2mm weight could be looked at and adjusted for the new guns that use so much of it.
---
10! and stickin' it to The Man!
---
Yep, just make sure you chose the faction you want alot of rep for in the heist.
---
Whike I live in a 4 storey house, all vendors are literally in the first room you can reach - for this very reason. üòÅ
---
I don‚Äôt think I received your request... classic lol
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be a problem for me lol.
---
Thanks, something weird went on there :-)
---
Well you aren‚Äôt going to like it if you don‚Äôt give a fair shake.
---
And then they added stupid shit the the game and performances issues started
---
Especially when someone buys multiple stuff üòµüòµ
---
Bonus stats
---
I don‚Äôt doubt that it‚Äôs broken but are you sure your not unlocking the challenges prematurely? Some of the challenges I do like halfway and it awards me, then when I finish said challenge I don‚Äôt get anymore score
---
For those saying it's stupid, and they would pay for things that aren't available right now... I'm with you, I agree. There is at least one outfit that I missed while I wasn't playing that I would dearly love to get. But now I have to wait until and if it returns, whenever that might be.
---
But having everything available is a consumer friendly approach. Or as consumer friendly as microtransactions in a full price game with optional subscription model can be.
---
But having a rotating stock and creating artificial scarcity and FOMO is profit friendly. Or at least that's the current business wisdom. So that's why companies do it that way, to extract as much short term profit out of customers as possible. 
---
Sure they might make additional trickle in revenue from items that were first available months ago or longer. But they'll make more money by holding it in reserve and only releasing it for sale occasionally. People will rush to get it, even those who may not buy it if it was going to be available over the long run. Because they know if they don't get it now, it might be a year until they see it again, if at all.
---
I‚Äôd say no. The lore is more interesting before you get absolutely tired of terminals though
---
That may be a player transferrring items to another character.
---
Ive tried that and it seems to have not helped much if at all unfortunately in my case. I did notice on my new characters it crafts so so much faster as well as inventories seem to move/respond as they should. I feel it may have a lot to do with the fact I have so much in my stash plan/clothing wise and the age of my main.(Beta char)
---
There‚Äôs a minefield full of them north of Monogonah. Guaranteed death without fireproof or dense.
---
I have been saying this from the start. Power armor is honestly not useful and get no love, even thought the skins are a selling point in the atom shop... I have made multiple post on this reddit trying to get people to start caring and only a very small number of people do.
---
Make this an effect of the pearly peepers (? The one from pleasant valley tickets). Give them a real use and some value
---
i want to give it a chance maybe some how someway it can prove me wrong 
---
I spent 6 hours installing this yesterday in hopes to give it an honest try. the least Bethesda could do is turn the servers on so I could make a character
---
This post was made in jest, sir. Calm thy titties.
---
Oooooooof
---
Makes sence
---
Was like 2k presents and tons of legendary stuff
---
Sorry, but for most people it's not that much of a design choice as a protection.
---
The further the vending machines are from the fast travel point, the less of a chance of them being exploited and offering out the entire stash and displayed items/bobbles/magazines...  
---
(Atleast from what I heard).
---
Some skins are nice, others are just pointless and just look horrible.
---
The bloodied would be worth building around and grinding for one better long term. Hell I‚Äôd even use that as I‚Äôve never had a bloodied handmade drop at all in 300 levels.
---
It could make for a fun reality show. Maybe the game industry needs a show like Hard Knocks.
---
If you have to choose between the two then go for Action Boy/Girl. Since it helps with other activities (sprinting/jetpack/power attack/etc) aswell as shooting in vats. I never personally have had the need to use GRS. And there are better perks in Luck (critical savvy for one). You can always get "increased action point refresh" on your armor pieces.
---
And i suppose these just grow on fist trees?
---
In that case it is a duper.
---
Those don't mean anything by the way :-). Pretty as you are...
---
Not sure what's in Canned Dog Food, as it isn't meat or veggies. Good Doggy perk works the same regardless of which mutation you have.
---
Nah, the scrapping perk cards is idiotic bullshit, pigeonholing people to a base build and punishing players that respecced (which is a whole different problem on it's own).
---
They should give Level/50+1 legendary points per level, and as a bonus you can scrap cards to gain 1 or 2 points on top of that.
---
Is it still rare ? Cuz someone else said it was and it ain't worth scrap for me
---
I don't think anything is actually 'passed on' and even if it is, it clearly doesn't lead to any significant improvements.
---
You think *you're* disappointed?
---
I was hoping for a pension. All's I got is tension.
---
Is it worth something ? Cuz I don't want it
---
I think mine was a Fascnacht reward.
---
Point is, there are 3-5 legendaries in the WS cottage loop.  
---
With a melee weapon, no using all those EC cartridges :)
---
Explosive weapons in general need a nerf. Or add dense to armor.  9/10 times I die is from explosives one or two shotting me, or a gauss shorty lagging the game so much until I die
---
I'd say the Handmade would be the best thing in here sadly, then the AA 10mm smg. Bloody builds  do the most damage but you'll be a glass canon, you'd need a set of unyielding armor or bolstering or a mix of both. 10mm Smg doesn't do super high damage but it's more than enough to take out the trash in the lower lvl regions and you don't need a specific build  for it. I would probably scrip the rest.
---
My collecting of boxing gloves and rolling pins say no.
---
Can trees grow on trees?
---
Not everyone wants to hide in a Bush like you
---
I don't see how it is an exploit if everything is working as intended. You're just taking full advantage of mechanics. It's not just a coincidence that there are so many perks and whatnot attributed to low health builds, and it's not like they forgot they had so many. They haven't been blind to something that they could literally change with the stroke of a key for the past two years. If they didn't want these things to stack, they just wouldn't stack. There is a trade off. You're sacrificing playstyle for power. Sure, you'll do massive damage, but you're also extremely susceptible to dying and have to keep maintenance on your character if you want to keep consistently high numbers. Some will feel it's  unbalanced when you line up the builds side-by-side, and that's their opinion, but it's how the game is built. You can't just say it was unintended bc you disagree. It's been the most popular build for the longest time, it's not a secret. I completely disagree that anyone can call something an exploit when it's pretty clear that it isn't an accident when there are strategy-specific components baked into almost every stackable aspect.
---
Jeez man this game came out 2 years ago. I bought in 2 days ago. And now I see this. Yikes. Lol.
---
SS seems better - I think someone else posted the SS numbers. But, using 2x studded heavy leather and 2x polished heavy metal and a BOS heavy chest, you get:
---
Heavy metal limb  54/12;
---
Heavy leather limb 32/77;
---
Heavy combat chest  86/86
---
So totals are:
---
Ballistic: 108+64+86=258
---
Energy: 24+154+86=264
---
I play on PC, the home of exploits, and have never even heard of this and certainly never had it happen to mine.
---
Exactly. Some new flavor like Spearmint or Melon since we can grow melons at camp.
---
If you use vats the gauss shotguns are great. They all are also inherently explosive so they benefit from demo expert. I use a ts vhc rw gauss shotgun and its great.
---
It only took me almost about a day to do, aside from tidying it up a little bit the next. I had most of the things stored from my previous camp, and a bunch of junk saved up.
---
Yea..  it still would take time, works and grind to upgrade legendary perk ranks. It would be way easier then the current system though and I don‚Äôt see an issue with that
---
Level 14 as of last night. I'm not terribly concerned...all I wanted was the clean sink!
---
49, without NW.
---
It is getting slower, 3 level ups a day now barely gets me 1.5 ranks.
---
Is the loss in accuracy from two-shot worth it though?
---
Don't stand with your back so close to a wall! Lol
---
If you use VATs then you'll definitely feel the drain on your fusion cores. Every time you try to enter VATs in PA (pressing the vats button even if there isn't a target), it uses 1% of your fusion core. I've grown used to spamming VATs to ensure I can get a hit off of enemies at events. This is a complaint I've had since release and nothing's been done with it. Maybe they'll make THAT a legendary perk :(
---
Nope. My Daily Challenges updated this morning and most of them were already done and I received no s.c.o.r.e.

LOL Thank you! That was super kind of you! Enjoy the shovel ‚ô•
---
If people cannot smell the satire in this post then.. that's fine. 
---
I have enough steel and lead to make enough 2mm ec to last me a year. 
---
I do carry a non gauss shotgun as well which i do usually us on the lower level enemies.
---
Unstoppable monster is a pretty beast back up for bloodied heavygunner builds, if you drop the 9 str for the heavy gun perks you still do great damage, especially if you run unyielding, and if you don't mind using 3 to 6 of your points you can still drop martial artist and or iron fist and crush if you dont mind losing blocker.
---
I think quite often people who say this have not in fact done everything there is to do.. nor do I believe many of them are even Aware of all the things to do and places to discover...
---
just hit 50 the slow down is real lol
---
I'm literally in an open field lmao.
---
It would be simple and fair just to do the exact same challenge every day "Earn at least 100 Overseer XP from Completing a Match".  Anyone can join a game and play until they die or win (complete a match, and not stay until the end of a match), and 100 Xp would stop players from just loading in and running into the fire.  It would also allow players to play nuclear winter as they want, Want to try and win? this doesn't stop that, Want to load in just to get SCORE done without being forced to a certain area or load out?  This doesn't stop that.
---
Almost every other challenge can be completed in 5 minutes or less, repair 10 weapons or armor (resource drain but fast enough), complete an event (any event without a timer, based on player speed), Buy or sell an item to another player (takes seconds, buy 1 ammo from a PV), Kill a Legendary enemy (partially luck based, but if you can kill scorch beasts fast then no problem), Kill 10 Scorches/Supermutants/Mole Miners.
---
I'll use it to bury the ex lol :-)
---
Not really. It‚Äôs a drop from turning in tickets at pleasant valley ski resort.
---
Hi, yeah i have finished that quest and got the uplink reward etc. Quest marker even says go talk to rose and she does prompt the conversation but then it won‚Äôt go further than that?
---
Same but with a chainsaw, gotta carve the turkey.
---
i rolled a two shot straight away and i was like 'nice!' and after about 10 minutes of actually using it i was all 'not nice!'
---
I rolled more and got a junkies which is what i wanted. 
---
Use it until you get it better
---
Honestly I think the marketing and community management would take the heaviest career hits for the fuckup that is 76.
---
In vats that loss of accuracy isn't a problem. Free aiming it's a issue but I only free aim when I'm just hopping around with my jetpack pretending I'm an ac130 so not really. The ads helps tighten the spread especially with scattershot.
---
From the pinned wastelanders tweet (14th april) you see 10 people.
---
That's a classical (Scrum) Team-of-Ten:
---
* 1 Product Manager
---
* 4 Software Engineers (trying to fix bugs, exporting assets for the atom shop)
---
* 2 Community Manager
---
* 1 Marketing
---
* 1 QE (probably on sick leave since F3)
---
* 1 Internship
---
The rest of them is QA.
---
Do you know which quest it was? Seems weird that this quest has started and tells me to talk to her but then won‚Äôt progress to the conversation even though she says what she does
---
See! Told you it works for when you need to bury sumthin'....
---
I took them out of my vending machines and dropped all but one near 76. If I make an alt I‚Äôll have them but it‚Äôs just so many trash plans now.
---
I know you‚Äôre hurting, and I sense your pain. But I thoroughly enjoyed that textual journey regardless of its content, and as such am deeply ambivalent. 
---
But still. Kudos and I hope your woes are salved, the wind always blows and your legs ne‚Äôer be pegged. 
---
ARRRRRRGH.
---
What do you expect from a company like bughesda?
---
thats absolutly true, perhaps i should give it another chance, one day :)
---
33. Haven‚Äôt missed a challenge yet but not going hard on the repeatable either.
---
I don‚Äôt find myself using VATS much, but I do usually aim down sights before shooting.
---
This is what happened after operation touchdown tho. Clear skies for a few weeks, then the destruction of the brotherhood
---
Yeah I agree.
---
There are some very instructive YouTube videos that explain ways to manage this, and even to benefit from it.
---
I crafted like 10 so I‚Äôve got some others to pick from.
---
I didn't say it was unintended, I said it should not function as it does
---
Under no circumstances, regardless of being low health or any of that, should anyone in any online game be able to kill the strongest boss in that game in one hit
---
Is this accessible on the xbone?
---
I had this absolutely insane idea lately... how about... making all weapons viable??!?!? Wouldn't that be crazy? No more shit roll scrip legendaries, because they all got their uses, strengths and weaknesses? Completely nuts, I know.
---
Bethesda just doesn't have any experience with good balancing and stuff like that, they're pretty fresh in the industry after all.
---
My mama was a raider a Papa was a raider I'm a raider and my kids going to be raiders.. lol
---
Only happens if you exploit to get more camp budget apparently.
---
That plane looks amazing. I wonder if it‚Äôll just be it‚Äôs own object or if it‚Äôll be like the wind generator.
---
Unfortunately, this is a different bug. Op is referring to one where the quests will just be finished instantly without any progress and award no SCORE
---
It should be the opposite.  Rush to lvl50+. Because you be doing the same damn thing anyways
---
There is a way to shorten the grass by modifying the custom ini file. I don't know if that would help for this.
---
I vote melon
---
This sub only bitches about the game. Any comment that isn‚Äôt deemed bitchy enough get downvoted.
---
Ye, it's a generator.
---
I conplete quest every day because it auto-completes...and that's it.
---
This cant come quick enough
---
It's got me hooked for a year and a half.   That's more than I can say about any game since diablo 2
---
Oh man. It‚Äôs about to real.
---
I don't think anyone wants the caps removed and if my post gave the impression that I would want that, I don't.
---
I, and a lot of other people would, however, appreciate it if all those caps would be transformed from daily to weekly. That way you can skip a couple of days and won't miss out on anything just because you have other commitments. 
---
I know they want us to login every day to claim that it has a decent enough userbase but I don't think that much would change if the limits were weekly instead of daily.
---
A moron then ?
---
That explains why he always sounds so frustrated when he FINALLY finds someone with the guts to help
---
Agreed, I absolutely loved this game for so long and then one exploit after another desolving my char's inventory value or destroying my current goals/hopes and I was left wondering why and I don't mean why are people exploiting or why are the developers not banning these trolls in mass but why am I subjecting myself to this type of blatant disregard for your biggest fans and supporters.
---
 I know this community is filled with "Don't play if your not 100% happy with it" clowns but the way I look at it. If I am actively supporting this game and playing by all the rules no matter how ridiculous than why am I punished constantly by Bethesda not punishing the exploiter(Who care less if this game is around in 5 year.) 
---
My time should be more valuable to a company like this because if its not than who's time do they find valuable? Am I just a lemming in their eyes another digital $ that may or may not come in? I refuse to grind another event like its my job to log hours and support a brilliant game when some asshat will come by on an alt and de-value everything I worked so hard for. Everything we fans have worked so hard for.
---
No, someone who knew not
---
I have a pistol build. He's viable. I use 44s and rely on Vats crit headshots. I can get credit for a queen kill but honestly I avoid most other big time enemies if I'm alone. 
---
He's considerably less lethal than my heavy, my bloodied commando and berserker rifleman but as I say, he's viable.
---
true two shot accuracy is ass.. but its a shotgun.. they come with shit accuracy to begin with..
---
i would just mod it out for highest accuracy you can get and try it.. 
---
if it sucks pass it on or scrip it
---
You made me chuckle
---
Next level you get the awesome Plushie
---
I would get another one. Two shot is a very low tier prefix (just 25% increased damage with massive recoil/accuracy penalty). And especially bad for shotguns because they already have really bad effective range etc. It's ok for vats use but shotguns eat up AP quickly and after you have spend it all you won't hit a a wall from 10 feet away. Also, it's worth to note that two shot breaks weapons twice as fast since it "two shot" shoots twice, and both count for durability (shotguns actually just get one extra pellet but still).
---
if you're not using it already bang on gun fu. Even 1 level helps a lot
---
haha, I agree. However, sometimes the "treasure" quest is very well done but 9/10 you are just cursing and running around like a headless chicken.
---
I heard about that one too, it‚Äôs crazy because the atom challenges had the exact same problem. Seems Bethesda changed the system without repairing it first
---
I was hopping from workshop to workshop the other night, and it makes the Cap noise, but doesn't actually take your caps for travel. The number stayed the same as I did my extractor farming runs.
---
gotta catch Dr Zorbo's ship, otherwise you lose
---
(i hope not, but otherwise why is his green ship there?!?)
---
The best part of early stages is that the inventory management due to the stupid stash limit doesn't take up more than half of the playtime.
---
It means this:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNuu9CpdjIo&amp;t=3s
---
Happened one time today. The other three times I tried it was fine.  I don‚Äôt know if it is related, but the time it froze I was being shot at by the turret in the grocery cart. The other times I had killed it first.
---
Oh....
---
Well i like loot
---
I was just about to post this.  It made the cap jingle, but didn‚Äôt actually take anything.  So it‚Äôs all good. 
---
Thanks Todd.
---
I believe it was Missing Link. And I tried everything like different servers, waiting for several days, etc. Nothing worked until I had to talk to her for something else.
---
I hate the loading/set up times for NW. It doesn‚Äôt help dying within the first 5 minutes lol
---
(everyone furiously)
---
(xbox pass mayhem ensues)
---
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
maybe it is bcz u r so much quicker. is no way for me to access my pip-boy, go to weapons, press x, press t, choose between 2 types of repair kit, close pip-boy in 2-3 seconds. Maybe u r the only superhuman who can do it that quick. As for me I have to wait only 0.5-1 second to access the pip-boy. But i am smart and I use alternative weapon and it takes me 0.1-0.5 second to press just 1 button.
---
How could they steal?
---
Make ten more? You got it
---
I went in on a fresh character just looking to unlock a crate and ended up killing 3 people within 5 minutes. I‚Äôm pretty sure most people would love this challenge compared to killing creatures.
---
anyone making furious ones?
---
I could use a Furious one...
---
(sheepsquatch legend grows)
---
Fun is subjective, and to a lot of people, myself included, efficiency is important. There's a reason every rpg under the sun has combat meta guides. It feels like the time you do spend isn't being wasted that way. Also, kicking ass and feeling like a badass is fun, if that even needs to be stated. Nothing does that here quite as much as killing an enemy with a bullet or two/one swing etc.
---
Yes. Some actually have weekly pools and/or allow roll overs. 
---
Does it matter? No.
---
Does it hurt to ask? No.
---
according to your picture, the dailys are not complete, you only partially did them... such as 1/3... 
---
Am I missing something?
---
Sometimes the owner has actually been there and done the "come here" emote by their vendor outside after I literally scoure their entire house lol. I hope they at least get a laugh from it.
---
Inspirational. Time to dust mine off.
---
That didn't work for me :/
---
Thats pretty much been their MO since the start üòê
---
I almost always do that event.  It's an easy 9 to 15 script of what is usually lightweight weapons and armor.
---
I've seen a large amount of other players with this but haven't experienced it
---
Sounds like an average 10 days in 76 to me!
---
In other news, prices on plasma cores are skyrocketing!  Invest now!
---
With Egghead will I need to lose perk cards I have equipped in Str and End?
---
Wait a bit they should decay into a meat pile. Then just look for the flies. Works for me 99% of the timw
---
If I found your camp/vendor in the wild, I would be all over those more obscure holotapes! I hate when people are charging like 50k for them. I'll never be able to afford those lol
---
You get a furious ffr frl fixer
---
And you get one
---
Everybody gets one!
---
Almost 29, have suffered from 2 rounds of SCORE challenges auto completing. Hoping to make it up this weekend.
---
If they increase the requirements, they should increase the reward as well. That way the run would be actually doable without paying for it.
---
Yes, this.... except I don't really want to see NW challenges removed entirely. I like that they bring more people into the mode, I just want those people to actually play and not do random crap and then quit or be AFK the whole time.
---
I wouldn't mind if the NW challenges were stuff that everyone actually does in the course of normal gameplay in nuclear winter and can be achieved in the span of an hour of playing it, like "level up in nuclear winter" or "find 3 epic crates in nuclear winter" but they're stuff that you might not do at all depending on your play style. I never bother with lockpicking or hacking and I avoid creatures when I play because they unstealth you.
---
Then again they did a pretty good job getting rid of the similarly bad challenges that used to plague adventure mode, so I'm sure they can improve the NW challenges without completely removing them.
---
That‚Äôs the only reason I keep a Fatman is to let my six year old daughter stand on the roof of Whitesprings and rain down nuclear hell on all the cars. She gets such a big kick out of it! It makes me smile üòä
---
Oh hell yeah.
---
Looking for a junkies explosive myself... honestly havent noticed any increase in god tier weapons ingame, honestly wouldn't know there was a dupe wave if I didn't browse this subreddit, people saying theyre finding them in train stations and for sale for caps on player vendors etc. but I am yet to see anything of the sort :(
---
I'm just annoyed that they've dropped the BOS Novice paint. My old rifle build has it, but I started my current melee build with Wastelanders and she just made it up to Elder last week.
---
yeah, thats nice with a bouncer. I hate when you warp in and after 10 minutes you realize they have built all the way down the cliff face, connected by stairs you didnt see. since Im a bit under the influence now, I might as well throw shit at all who build high up in power grid lines. fuck.
---
Actual quote from a level 106 friend of my friend who said he had done everything in the game: "wait, the enclave is in this game?"
---
Yep. Everything that is fun to do gets restricted. Enjoy logging in for ~30 minutes a day forever
---
Have you seen the market pages?! I can‚Äôt even sell a regular legendary without being knocked for NOT selling one as well.
---
Just sent you a new one
---
That too
---
okay but what does a rolling pin have to be mad about
---
Yeah I just finished a fight with one about an hour ago as well. Got a weightless heavy raider leg. Spent about 6 fusion cores, 1000 5.56 and 1000+ .50 cal. Oh also got 50 caps. Yay.
---
Idk man it just has anger issues apparently
---
Mine is fearlessbitc
---
Technically they are. You can take sapling from a tree and plant it to grow other one.
---
Never seen it myself, but there is an exploit.
---
and up to 20-30(admitedly low level) mobs depending where you have to go and time permitting when you do the hoarde that usually procs after it.. if you do it right you can milk the hoarde for more legendayr mobs too..
---
Send a ticket to Bethesda. I‚Äôve been doing the same each day and making sure I follow up on each one. Eventually with more and more people being affected they will have to have a response. Right now they just hope it‚Äôs a small minority who keep their mouths shut.
---
Cats used to use it to exploit the game. They fixed it
---
Agreed. I've been playing since drop and never launched a nuke or even done the enclave stuff. I've been to the Cranberry Bog like twice. I'm on my third character and the highest level I've ever gotten to was like 50 so. My current char is L40-ish. I love just roaming around and finding the little things Beth adds in, unmarked locations and what not. I squirrel out constantly....if something catches my eye I will run over to it.
---
My favorite legendary fight was as a lvl 20, a lvl 50 Sheepsquatch randomly spawned at the Top of the World Ski Resort and I had level 10 and 15 weapons on hand. I used every type of basic ammo and blew through all my meds, ammo, buffs, and repair kits on hand to take him down. Took a good half hour hiding atop a barricade but was worth the experience!
---
The mall parking lot cleared with one grenade.
---
I must admit I‚Äôve had my eye on that sweet plushie boy. I‚Äôm thoroughly enjoying the lunchboxes so far most. Confetti mess is my jam.
---
lol classic
---
I believe its to do with the game automatically creating and linking a bethesda account for you, it gives it a random name, which is the string of numbers and letters you see. Whether or not you can change your account name I don't know.
---
Sad that old theater house got turned into an empty lot...
---
Wait there‚Äôs a cap for only 1000 scrip!? I‚Äôm about to hit that saving up for Fixer legendaries and I haven‚Äôt got the plans yet!!
---
I forgot about that but yep...that's another 3 or 5 script.
---
I launched my first ever nuke last night at 1am eastern. Went down there and waited for people to show. A level 9 showed up, and then....nobody. Looked at the map, and it was an abandoned server. 
---
Thought my gauss minigun would make a mark on her. Several hundred rounds barely made a dent in her bar, so I just gathered some flora and XP and left with my head down. 
---
Next time I‚Äôll check the map before running the silo( and maybe it won‚Äôt take me an hour the second time to launch it!)
---
What does 2525 mean?
---
The gold star is completed but he only has four finished. It‚Äôs happening to many people and Bethesda won‚Äôt respond or fix the issue. It‚Äôs been happening with the old atom daily‚Äôs and didn‚Äôt respond then either.
---
That's total BS right there. Why can't they reward SCORE, sounds like BS ? Yeah not fair for sure.
---
Also are you logged in when the challenges switch over. People say make sure you logged out during the switch over.
---
For real, when I level grind it feels like I‚Äôm at a second job. I play to relax not work.
---
It's also a great economic stimulus.
---
Haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but thought the challenge to build camp items in nuclear winter mode seemed a bit silly.
---
I love this post.
---
ahhh, I just assumed that was from the day before.
---
Stop making sense
---
Do you have any in particular you'd find interesting? I try to mostly add the ones from random encounters, the radio dramas and stuff from areas of the map people likely wouldn't have been to. There's the Pipboy games too but those aren't really something you find often.
---
Aww man I'm jealous I wish I got a weightless heavy raider leg
---
I thought they were still making changes to the legndary perk system. 
---
That aside. How do you figure its 1500 levels to max out a legendary perk? What is the math on that?
---
I'm kinda sad that I choose foundation for my main, but the I wipe away my tears with my bloodied gauss shotgun.
---
Well yeah it would be better because it's much lower, but it's still far too high. I've played around 130 hours and am at level 120-120ish (I don't remember exactly), to be told I've need to play hundreds more hours to level up some card perks is obscene and would put me off playing all together.
---
I think I gave a fair shake to it due to trying to do a couple of these challanges, but it just makes me dislike NW even more. Even tho I got in top 5 multiple times.
---
Hmmm okay. We're still looking into this, hang tight for me!
---
According to Steam achievements i'm still sleeping in Vault 76. Wake me up when you deal with Scorched. ;)
---
Yup. It seems it still works in their benefit, because we can‚Äôt legitimately win. The old bug saved them giving us free atoms. This new one handy caps us from winning. I‚Äôll end up having to pay to win.
---
I was on my way to a camp to buy something, didn‚Äôt care what, just went by the vault along the way to drop a level 1 pipe pistol and ammo and someone bought something off of me. Wish I could‚Äòbe thanked him.
---
Time gates need to go!
---
how can Path of Exile can do it without time gates?
---
if you don't have enough content to make them play the game, just make sure they login every day for a boring ass grind?   
---
Such short term thinking smh.
---
Feels like they should give everyone enough free Score and Atoms to complete this season of Legendary Run as an apology for releasing a completely broken system that adds nothing to the game and removes dozens of useful rewards.
---
Better luck next time, Bethesda.
---
No, it's not. That code indicates a general game crash on PS4, it has nothing specifically to do with Fallout other than letting you know it just crashed.
---
Moments like that are awesome. 
---
  https://youtu.be/ynI_Du1l4ME
---
Introducing fallout 2nd, removal of all timegates, $50/month...
---
that is what I do when leveling a toon.. I rush to lvl 50
---
I dont do much more than brush up against some of the early main questlines until I level to 50 so Im getting max level drops..
---
Ill do events, dalies and discover locations in the forest first.. then the same for toxic valley and repeat for ash heap.. 
---
the only place in the east Ill go before level 50 is to the Top Of The World area because that cell has a lower mob cap than the rest of the eastern map..
---
It's odd that they've not shut vendors down to fix the duping, but I guess Bethesda gonna Bethesda.
---
Could post daily/weekly challenges on it rather than going out to the menu to look.
---
interesting, I sell 5-8 Legendaries every day (3\*).  Since there isn't any Market data for all people, I just assumed that was normal.
---
The game is just so much better when you really dive deep into it. Even in the weeks leading up to wastelanders I was still finding the occasional new thing hidden somewhere that was in from release, even with all the exploration I did. Now I feel like I need to start over from scratch and comb the map again because of all the new "unmarked" changes they added to everywhere with wastelanders.
---
If you have a couple perks naked up it's definitely worth trying. I'll be on later and can test it if no one else chimes in.
---
26
---
Isn‚Äôt The Repeatable a Reacharound er Workaround for the Non-Nw Crowd? -Me Included because if I wanted to be Murdered Brutally by other People I can just go outside IRL LUL.
---
First time I went to top of the world when I was around your level it was a legendary level 85 deathclaw, needless to say I ran for my life lol. The whole right side of the map is brutal if you‚Äôre under like 40
---
I once killed a legendary while still glowing green it stayed glowing after it died, was super easy to find. I wonder if they could just turn that back on after it‚Äôs dead?
---
in steam, go to the fallout 76 store page and scroll down to add ons. its the starter pack bundle.
---
Ah okay, thank you. Kinda weird it doesn't take you right to the page lmao.
---
I just need to hit lvl 100 to have the platinum trophy
---
 I stopped playing before any of the new content came out
---
19 I think, I stopped keeping track and went back to having fun
---
Level up is easier with a new toon for the season.
---
Foundation thanks you.
---
&gt; No communication from Bethesda other than "its on our radar" and "we are investigating"
---
you left out "we will pass this on to the team"
---
Reasons for this:
---
A) PvP isn't forced and easily avoidable.
---
B) Excessive amounts of loot with a stash limit.
---
C) The game isn't super popular.
---
This is why you should change your camera view to third person while hiding.  You can swing the camera around 360 degrees, and see how well hidden you are.  And, it won't move your character while doing so.  Makes it easier to see the field around you without tipping off your location.
---
I dont understand why people do it. Seems boring as hell.
---
The game isn‚Äôt designed to be take your time.. enjoy it 
---
Because it the same content lol it not like other games where you only do low lvl content at low lvls
---
Why don't you put her in charge?
---
With all weekly and a couple of NW challenges done (one daily missing from today) I'm at 28. The slowing progress already showing, so I hope they're serious about those double score weekends.
---
Agreed. 
---
Just the amount of locations with environmental story telling scenes is absurd. Been playing since beta. Launched zero nukes. 
---
I just build. And explore. Enjoy the little stories that are all over. So many stories to consume and enjoy.
---
After few hours of server hopping I finally found the witch, but she didn't have the plan...
---
I think this was the case. I fixed it by looking at "Bethesda.Net" in the in-game 76 options to see which email is linked. I then created an account on Bethesda's website using that email and now the new Username I created when making that new Bethesda account is showing in game on 76. Thanks!
---
I mean. miniguns have better damage
---
Saw someone in Chinese Stealth armor during Fasnacht looking like that.  Looked like something out of Aeon Flux.
---
Well it ain‚Äôt like the repair armor and weapons challenge I literally had to repair 10 weapons for 250 S.C.O.R.E
---
It's future proofing the game. It is not meant to be achieved, but rather to have something to work for. My most played game on steam is currently Black Desert Online, a fantasy MMO which has no level cap, and at current pace I earn 1% of a level per day of grinding. It will take me 3 months to hit level 61, and since the number of XP required to level doubles every time, it will take me six months after that to hit 62, and a full year to hit 63. The highest level person in the game is 65, which I should hit in 5 years of grinding multiple hours every day. Of course BDO actually has difficult high value areas like Ash Forest which are too high level for anyone currently in game to clear, so there is actually a content reason to grind for years, unlike FO76 which the only purpose of unlocking legendary perks is to make the already easy content even easier.
---
Whenever this happens to me they've been yesterday's dailys and playing for a bit eventually caused the new ones to display.
---
Have been able to complete the new ones when they werent displayed.
---
We made the ini read only and it worked
---
There is just a cap on claiming them. It is like paying you in paycheques but then post dating the cheques. Technically we payed you but you cant cash it out yet lol.
---
Yup. Why not just leave Gauss weapons out and stick to old school bullets and explosives? I do agree on the explosives, I‚Äôve been maimed once too many times by a plasma grenade that literally one shots me in marine armor. I even have Bodyguards perk and it seems to not work worth a shit.
---
Everyone  thanks for your feedback it has let me relised my little progression
---
Not true, they have all kinds of fancy Power Armor skins in the Atom shop but with the status of power armor there is no incentive to actually wear except as a fashion accessory. Its actually better to not wear Power Armor for bonuses, damage resistance, energy resistance, and rad resistance. You would think they would fix that to give people a reason to spend money in the atom shop for all that fancy Power Armor stuff. or to at least set it up so Power Armor can be safely displayed.
---
I'd like to just fast travel? what the hell happened to fast traveling? is it the same bug when you go to a vendor and choose to trade your weapon reloads or comes out? Ugh...
---
those are just SBQ grinders   
---
also if they run silo and launch the nuke, complaints form randoms doesnt matter  
---
also Imagine playing bethesda game without using glitches when the whole game is One big glitch
---
My friend does punch everything car she sees, and scares me sometimes, sometimes because I forget she does that, and I jump over every thing I can, and when she punches a car near me it stops me dead in the air
---
Now who do I have to join to get a gauss lever gun.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
launching a nuke as well as starting and finishing my own encryptid is all I havent done as far as missions go..
---
there are some dailies and events I havent touched yet also
---
I've heard of the dense chest mod but where did everyone get their dense head mods?
---
a WHAT??!!
---
This. 
---
76 is such a great sandbox for RP'ing, and any decent RPer will quickly establish their own motivations and goals, which add sooooo much to a play through. 
---
When you have "quests" that you just have to complete because it's what your character would do? So satisfying. 
---
It carries over to building styles and such as well. 
---
If players took 20 minutes to think about their character, some basic back story and motivations? They'd enjoy the experience so much more than being "Vault Dweller #28374737 who murders things and collects stuff"
---
You didn't have to.
---
Use photo mode to look around. You can zoom in an out, make the fov bigger and zooming in loads in distant objects.
---
I also hear this
---
I use to have a legendary Sheepsquatch spawn behind my camp from time to time until Wastelanders came out and changed some random encounter locations
---
I did and it said I will receive no response.
---
also thats like the only possible end game grind if you dont count those time locked dailies/gold bullion/legendary scrips  every 20hours
---
Me2!
---
I‚Äôm a shotgun build and use a ts vhc fr gauss, and find it incredibly accurate. Anything that shows up in vats, however far away, I‚Äôll potshot. That vhc modifier does the job - plus it‚Äôs magic.
---
I'm sorry
---
Don‚Äôt rush because there is nothing at the finish line. There isn‚Äôt even a line. Just people going from a run to a confused walk.
---
And please put them all in one place. I‚Äôm saddened when its four vendors on four crazy floors filled with mounted heads and every other Knick knack the game has to offer
---
Laugh my complete ass off.. so true.
---
Where the FUCK are the shops ?!!
---
25% faster fire rate and 25% less VATS cost
---
Responder Bot Vendors sell them. I'm pretty certain that's where I acquired mine.  
---
I'm just not 100% sure WHICH vendor because it's been so long.

Yeah unfortunately üòî. My dad accidentally bought a duped weapon from a players machine and then I few days later it suddenly disappeared (a separate incident from when his Bloodied The Fixer disappeared). I'll tell you what they told me to identify a duper in PM. üëç

[Looks like they are hiring a shitfuckload of senior positions for programming so I imagine they cant retain people and are at the same time trying to scale up. Probably nightmarish.](https://jobs.zenimax.com/jobs?department=&amp;located=Austin%2C%20TX%2C%20US&amp;location=)
---
I wasn‚Äôt really a fan at first either, but the more I play trying to complete the dailies for the score points, the more im enjoying it. Just ground to get the ghillie suit and actually won my first match yesterday. Now I‚Äôm trying to get all the holiday rewards before they patch their mistake, just gotta get the winter jacket now.
---
OMG yes, lol. I carry a reduced weight AA swing speed rolling pin, bloodied SS flaming pitchfork, and junkies SS rw shovel.... just for the fun of using those weapons.
---
Don't get me wrong, there are echo chamber moments too. Those tend to come and go pretty quick.
---
You'll soon realise (if you haven't already) all the long lasting stuff you keep hearing over and over tend to be legit issues.
---
Anyhow, better late than never :)

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a nerf, it‚Äôs just enemies not taking damage or rubber banding back to full health.  Line in the sand is almost unplayable because of this bug.
---
Primed bloodied plasma caster hits for almost 3200 and the scorched don‚Äôt even slow down.
---
Trying to find all the scorched you killed in a nuke zone is impossible, they blend in perfectly with the brush and dirt
---
None are bad by any means. I wouldn‚Äôt even say script worthy. What play style and perk cards do you favor?
---
Killing the ‚Äòend game‚Äô boss, in 10 seconds is not how it‚Äôs supposed to be.
---
Just keep sending them in. Mine said the same and that there was nothing they can do. Why would they fix it. We‚Äôll just have to pay to get ahead. ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù for hyphen in the end.
---
I run iron skin with the extra health and poped 3 supers with healing Bobby head and medicine perk with grounded.... Still died instantly xD
---
I don't think it's counterable xD
---
Lucky! You must just be a wizard or something. I sell plans more often than not, but legendaries rarely budge.
---
Come on this is much simpler than the make a picture one yesterday. I spent 5 hours drawing my character on an etch-a-sketch and still didn't get any score. :(
---
I got the atoms on PS4, but nothing else.
---
Yeah, Bethesda is never responding to this post.
---
They should but it's just not the Bethesda way.
---
I didn't do any of them. If you look at the time stamp only 9 min. passed and most of that's me trying to figure out how to get a pic. And the gold star is complete and not all the challenges have been done.
---
Group kills should give do to everyone not just you killing the thing or your friend.
---
That person must've had no perception AT ALL!
---
It kneads to flatten that problem out before it rises again, doughn't you agree?
---
I think I‚Äôm 22 today. I‚Äôve missed a fair amount of dailies but always get my weeklies and never do the nw ones
---
Dang, that's really cool!
---
I want a handmade not a fixer...dont like using.45 ammo it uses.
---
There's not enough content to keep anyone interested that long.
---
I mostly sell ammo.  SInce I already have what I consider the best armour/weapons in the game, I just sell everything 3\* the rest goes to scrip... even then I dump several a day for scrip.   
---
It also helps to server jump after a while.
---
Same on Xbox.
---
Fair point.
---
However, people would most likely be less inclined to go out of their comfort zone and buy stuff on Ebay or whereever else if the chances to land a good roll were slightly better. 
---
Just as an example, with the Mumbles sale going I spent over 1000 scrip on rolls. There wasn't a single good roll in there. I don't want or need a god roll, I just want something decent. As it stands, I've wasted scrip on garbage that goes right back into the scrip machine. If I have the space in my stash to store 15 or so 3 stars.. Which I usually don't, so a lot of that goes right into the bag on the ground.
---
Or the SBQ fight. I've dropped dozens of nukes on her, took part in many, many more fights triggered by others. How many 1\* Rolling Pins are acceptable before this can be considered a crap system? Some may say that this event is for Ultracite plans and the guaranteed flux but this argument loses a lot of momentum at high levels. I know all the plans and nuke other places for flux because the yield is much higher. 
---
Which brings me to my next point. Why is dropping a nuke not always an event? Spawning the Queen in other places makes no sense story and location wise but it could still be turned into a public event by increasing the mob spawn rate considerably and by adding a buffed standard enemy. Behemoths are in the game, why not use buffed versions of those?
---
The Colossus is a good first step in the right direction, though.
---
My point is, there is a difference between tedious grind and rewarding game play. Bethesda managed to build an incredible world but totally failed with the rewarding part. I think they just under estimated the task of creating a Fallout MMO although with ESO being a thing and id being a part of Bethesda there is no real excuse for all the weird stuff that goes on in the game.
---
You scrap unused perk cards.
---
Pc, xbox, ps4? Cause im looking for lore
---
That‚Äôs literally my point. You could buff up to hell to the teeth, and still get one shotted by a gauss shotgun build only running shotgun perk. It‚Äôs ridiculous
---
I agree. More enclave themed items would be amazing
---
49
---
yeah I see that Gold Star one, I just thougt it was from the day before... so yeah, that is weird.
---
I found pipe weapons and melee weapons that drop off mobs to be good repair options. At least when you repair it the cap sale value goes slightly up.
---
You say that like the game doesn't *already* have stability issues.
---
A bit crumby, I think he deserves butter
---
Any chance you could upload your ini? Might be the reason a lot of game pass users are getting the same error.
---
What he said......
---
This argument kind of makes sense, but in that case should be rolled out and iterated on over time.  Something that takes a few months at a time and continues upgrading, like a FFXIV relic.
---
That made me chuckle. Lol.
---
Can confirm that this happens on ps4 too.
---
Your one of the bois
---
just been there while doing weekly "claim workshop x5". haven't seen any screws. where are they? o_0
---
All they needed to do was expand on the reputation system they added in wastelanders.
---
Lvl 30, I've only missed one NW challenge.
---
Gotta get that hanging cage tree :o
---
I sell them for like 75caps.  I sell everything for 50% or more of MSRP.   You on Xbox?
---
The joke with this is that literally everything we do in game is pointless because all the people it would have affected are long gone. Do literally anything we do in game make doing anything else easier? The scorched detection system absolutely does nothing at all. The scorched numbers aren‚Äôt affected at all. At least some games give you the illusion of choice and effects here it‚Äôs either do the thing or don‚Äôt.
---
On ps4
---
I‚Äôm desperate for these, especially anything with Dick Shale or the Golden Holotape. You on PC?
---
Oh right on.
---
you were supposed to do it on twitch though. I bet you didn't.
---
Yes. 1000 is the max. After that everything you turn in gives scrip to the server but not you.
---
Same for Gold. You can turn in bonds for Gold even if you are at the limit but at least you can buy it back 1:1 if that happens.
---
Stupid system or not? You be the judge.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Don't give them any ideas lol
---
Gamepass is awesome for this reason :)
---
If youre not a high enough level for even 1 of the pieces you cant get in it.
---
We've all been there
---
From a ticket I filed on spawn point issues.  
---
Please include the following details to help us reproduce and diagnose what happened.
---
What were you doing?
---
I think it is more what I did than what I am doing: I believe I built my CAMP on a spawn point.
---
What did you expect to happen?
---
I expected to have a normal, non-eventful CAMP site.
---
What actually happened?
---
Well it started with me being spawned into the floors of my base, or stuck against the floors. Sometimes I would be spawned inside the lower level of my base which is walled off from the outside - I have water purifiers in the lower level.
---
Then other players started showing up in that sealed off area and I thought these other players were somehow glitching into my base in order to steal water from my water purifiers. This may not be the case, but that these players are either teleported into the walls like me or into the lower levels because I might be on a spawn point.
---
What else would you like us to know?
---
Another issue that I might be causing conflict with is 'in game camp site' I built my CAMP next to or in proximity with; that my CAMP site my be causing interference with the random events that are supposed to occur there. This came to my attention when I saw the 'Hex Shaped' Symbol appear next to my CAMP at this 'in game camp site' where an event was occurring - when I teleported to this random event - it disappeared. 
---
And to think I thought these other players were cheating in order to get into my CAMPS lower level. They obviously were not.
---
 I will dismantle and move my CAMP the next time I log into the game.
---
\---------------
---
There were times I would spawn into the game, under the map mesh, under my CAMP.
---
You can't craft the jacket, goggles or hat?
---
Whoa chill bro, no need to get so defensive, Just asking an innocent question.
---
logged in on an alt yesterday at the rusty pick and squatchy was just chilling at my vendors.
---
i was all 'go away squatchy you're drunk. You don't even understand currency or have pockets to hold it'
---
It may not be an option. Even w/everything they updated for Fallout 76, this engine is still being asked to do a bunch of stuff it just wasn't built for. Barring some serious work under the hood, I don't know that they can push dynamic object rendering much further in the open world. I mean, they were already concerned at the load of allowing more than one ally at CAMPs.
---
It still gives reduced falling speed and reduced limb damage.
---
About how much time a day does this take if I may ask? I'm using bonus xp perks and items and sit at lvl 30, maybe I'm not farming the right stuff or am bad at grinding, but I do put in quite some time.
---
5 for variety, but I play alot. My main is 580 something, bloodied hvy, all the rest are mid 100 to mid 200. Each character does different things for my little stable of adventurers, spreads out the weight of my collections in my stashes.
---
I eventually realized the futility of owning a camp designed like a home.  For what purpose? So I can sleep? So instead I made a an shop.  It‚Äôs 4x4 with one entire side open to the world. I recently revamped it to look like a Slocum‚Äôs Joe with the new pack and it‚Äôs beautiful.  No hidden vending machines for me! If you can‚Äôt find my vending machines, you sir are literally blind, as there is nothing else really there to get lost in.
---
Silly me, didnt realize it was crafted ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôll get changed from read only on next boot- this game won‚Äôt let you keep it read only
---
Wait, is gun-fu fixed now? It was broken there for a while I thought.
---
3 queen runs in an hour, 3 ranks a night. 30 ranks over 6 cards. 10 days should make it hard enough for even the highest level players
---
Mine has it.
---
Tell me about it!  I play a melee build, and it's insane how much I have to spend on ammo!!
---
I think I might have one in my vendor for 1 or 5 caps. Username adrienadams. I won't be oplaying until about an hour and a half
---
Lucky me and my trusty BER/25/SPEED Pipe Rifle :)
---
They need to get on the bugs before updates.    
---
After this recent one, I can't recall the number of times I've killed an enemy only for it to ragdoll through a wall and/or into the ground. I've lost at least 5 legendaries this way.
---
My dad is one of those players that just runs through the main quest,trophies, etc and then thinks the game is "done" even though it's just not that kind of game. Sure, you got some stupid trophy but you're missing out on the free-roaming, adventure type shit. That's what Fallout is all about.
---
You've just gotta keep telling them to explore and forget about the set missions and all that
---
thats all I want too!
---
13 or 14
---
I started a few days late because I was bummed about Adrenaline being borked.. but I have been playing normally.. Im not trying to complete any challenges intentionally, in fact I have only glanced at the list a couple of times..
---
4...
---
you're not supposed to throw your melee weapons at the enemy you gonk
---
Did i say i refuse? All i mentioned that metal armor has higher dr
---
i've never noticed it being broken. It still switch target.
---
If you don't finish them that day they are updated to new one the next day. lol
---
33 with absolutely no motivation to keep going. Already burned out.
---
29.1
---
holy shit.. fucking game is unplayable..
---
At this point they should just flat out go full shameless monetization. Pay to win no longer exists with the current pvp. I propose time gate savers in the Atom store. Grind as much as you want using atoms and $. Get unlimited access to caps, gold, scrip etc by resetting your time gate counters!
---
I assumed that we would be getting player homes we could decorate, not making our camps instanced. Would be annoying to hit a load screen because you got close to someone's camp
---
IKR!
---
Can't they give us something like this instead of the dumb NW challenges?
---
It should spit out robotic notes and allow us to retrieve them like the vendor bot. That way I can flex my sales by dropping receipts.
---
33
---
Success! It worked! :D
---
I know a spot that always has a medium sized crate and 2 small crates. Sometimes a large supply crate spawns. If you can the right spots they'll always be there.
---
30
---
29 and burned out at 20 lol...
---
Mine doesn‚Äôt. I tried posting a photo as proof but the subreddit doesn‚Äôt allow it
---
I'd sure prefer that, but NW seems to have a solid fan base that would disagree
---
The devs continue to prove that they just don‚Äôt get PVP
---
first the original mechanic of tag then hope the other person does not instantly block you then server hop to get away from someone THEY view as a greifer  ( ther do. Yhere not here to pvp for whatever reason and At best they will view you as a pest looking for ‚Äúez killz‚Äù trying to force them to do something they just don‚Äôt want to do)
---
if they wanted pve to exist along side pvp, well to be bunt that part was never realy going to work. They tried to get it to work way back in Everquest 1. Back then they had to learn the hard way that trying to ballance limited ‚ÄùAI‚Äù (which it wasn‚Äôt, just one or more scripts with limmited options)  against people and balancing player vs player would be two different problems. Never mind Bethesda kind of has a well earned reputation for making gear and weapons that are flat out broken because vs NPCs it can be hilariously fun and who cares about the fact that you can instagib a behemoth because doing somis Fun....
---
untill you introduce pvp using level gated loot then being on the receiving end of intakills stops being fun For at least half of the players.
---
but no, they have thr mentality that they have to lure people into PVP without realizing that with there broken ass mechanics and broken ass weapons and armor it‚Äôs just not going to happen Untill they go in and actualy Fix ALL of there broken ass crap.
---
What a wack argument lol. Its one thing to say you dont need to max it out and another to say its impossible. You dont need to get lvl 100 for your season but atleast its almost possible
---
I did the same today
---
Inside the Sheepsquatch's head: *Hmmm, why yes, that is a pretty good value for that 3 * handmade. I have just enough caps to buy it* 
---
&lt;sneezes&gt;
---
&lt;auto cue for buying something&gt;
---
Squatch: *Wait, I didnt mean to buy that 2 shot pipe pistol. WAIT HOW MUCH DID I JUST WAIST ON THIS CRAP!*
---
What you hear: **BAAAHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAA**
---
I know. I've done the math and 1500 levels to max out all 6 is the most asinine bullshit I've seen so far. That's 180 million XP. Let that sink in.
---
You decided to go into my comment history but it doesn't seem you saw why I said something was a mental issue. Yelling at someone over taking water from a purifier means you clearly have anger issues. Which is related to your mental health. My snarky little comment over you being a toxic asshole is not anger issues. If you don't want people responding negatively, don't put out what is obviously going to get negative attention. Otherwise as you put it, you're fair game. I played since launch so I have at least a slight idea of what used to be sought after. I don't know about legacies buffs and nerfs and everything, but I don't need to to know that people were capable of keeping them around if they wanted to try it at a later time. Not everyone with legacies are assholes either. I have not come across a single person using a legacy that was being inconsiderate of others getting hits. Not recently anyways, only when they actually first became known as legacies. Either way, you're still a dick. But I still hope you have a nice day anyways:)
---
Right on? You need to scrapp 100 cards just to upgrade it once then 150 to do it again etc.
---
I never thought I‚Äôd say this, but I actually do kinda enjoy NW now. I‚Äôm still TERRIBLE at it, but it‚Äôs a fun change of pace, esp when you get matched with a good team. I still don‚Äôt esp like PVP, but to me it‚Äôs more like high stakes tag or hide and go seek. I‚Äôm glad I finally bit the bullet and tried it out now, even though it took me months to work up the courage.
---
Ward‚Äôs a dick and more people would rather get doused with radiation then deal with him.
---
The only things left to explore right now is bugs, glitches, dupes. You're really never know what you might find. So much enjoyment every time see something not working properly. I remember once there was missing texture in Savage Divide forest (pink square with white text "missing texture" on it). This was most harmless bug in this game. It was a long tome ago though.
---
Its ok to play in slow pace, enjoy a couple good quests this game have, yet it does not justify state of the game at all. Have fun.
---
Glad to hear you are enjoying as it‚Äôs the mode that continuously brings me back to this game.
---
26 on one account and 28 on another.... I haven't been doing the NW ones and I haven't completed the weekly for this week yet. I rack up XP quick, so it hasn't been too bad. I know it is gonna hurt later tho. Haven't decided if I'm gonna keep up on both or just do one in the end.
---
Yeah I don't do YouTube
---
The current system they are testing would take a person lvl1500 to rank up 6 card to max.  Maybe 10 days will be too soon but it should be a reachable goal similar to reaching lvl50 
---
Don‚Äôt confuse time consuming content for difficult content.. 
---
Correct difficult content is done via obtaining gear, clearing mission(dungeons / raids ) etc etc. At no point should character development be considered
---
‚Äúcontent ‚Äú
---
I really, really like the light machine gun, but yeah it goes through ammo like crazy. It's super powerful though, it's just a shame you can only craft a few .308 rounds at a time. At least with .50 you can craft over a hundred at once.
---
Somehow I've managed to lose a scorchbeast corpse. More than once... like how? They're huge.
---
There‚Äôs only one card I‚Äôm really interested in. 
---
Plus I have a lot of cards since my main character is lvl 500 something.
---
If you have to search for a new server due to camp not being placeable or swap servers it bugs workshops etc.
---
Close and reopen and it fixes them.
---
29
---
LLMAO
---
Western slopes?  I think that's a random spawn location for it.
---
Theres a saw mill at foundation that is stuck in wood. Watch me find the parts for it, dress up and use a wrench to fix it üòÇ. There's no end
---
Some high level players with caps to spare will buy out low level vendors then give the stuff back to the new player in order to help them build caps.
---
I have 4 characters with right at 30k caps each and enough items in my stashes to keep them at 30k pretty much forever. If I see a new person with stuff like this I will buy it and give it all back, giving them caps and gear. If they have a mic I will also help them with pricing and anything else they may be having trouble with.
---
So perhaps they are not doing it to be a dick?
---
Or the blimming robots that decide to self destruct and completely disappear
---
This.  It's pointlessly brutal.
---
I actually have a plasma thrower as my "oh shit I'm in trouble" weapon. It's fairly effective but I only ever use it as a last resort. Unfortunately I don't have Slug Buster as I did the Vault 79 raid with the settlers, but I have a friend who said he'd pick it up for me whenever he does the raid.
---
I have no idea what that's all about but I ran into the same problem yesterday. Only happened at my camp though. I was able to use a wild power armor station.
---
My camp serves a few purposes and none are having a typical home. I have some crops on the ground, a shrine for Gramps, a vendor in front of the alien stonehenge, a building for my display cases since I love collecting stuff and a single floor built as high as possible atop a bunch of stairs for a nice view where all my crafting stations and a bed are.
---
&gt;Because right now you are just sounding like a ignorant twat.
---
Says the neck beard in his mom's basement, who thinks being a video game vigilante is doing the world any good. And what skills/programs/equipment do you have to determine whether or not a weapon is duped to engage in your asinine behaviour in the first place?
---
Put the pizza rolls down, Judge Dredd. You're not a badass, just an ass.
---
The ‚Äúclean‚Äù sink isn‚Äôt even unique, it still only dispenses dirty water!
---
Haha I hope so
---
I doubt this game last untill they get released so no point in worrying about it
---
Bummer bro. I was going to say that I'd just give you them. I have three, i think.
---
I have never gone out of my way to use an XP buff.
---
Congrats. That is awesome. I remember being so afraid of scorch beasts I used to run and hide in a shed lol Now I can solo the Queen in 4 clips. :) Keep at it...
---
If you go for armor its a bit cheaper if you use perks but still uses 20 ballistic fibre total.
---
I already complained about it. I was shot down. Seems people love this.
---
If you repair knives, they won't use adhesive. Like, lower level ones.
---
My buddy and I constantly kill each other by blowing up whatever vehicles the other one of us are near. It's been a running joke since release day for us. Whenever we play with new people they look at us like we're crazy.
---
Good god, it would take me hours! I think I could count on one hand how many players I‚Äôve actually killed in NW, and I‚Äôve played more than I ever thought I would. PVP just makes me anxious and jumpy, but I‚Äôm apparently a glutton for punishment when fun rewards are at stake.
---
Get to level 20
---
I agree it needs to be increased, but most of the time it‚Äôs user resource management and choice of what to build. All I want is for floating bases to no longer be a thing and at least a quarter budget increase. I‚Äôd be a happy C.a.m.p.e.r then.

Im up to getting the leather gillie suit. Can't remember what rank that's on.
---
Im constantly changing outfits as I play so your not alone! Trying to hunt down a traveling leather coat now to wear for 15 minutes before it gets cycled lol.
---
nobody is forcing you to do it
---
It‚Äôs a camp interior, not replacement camp. If you look on the roadmap item it looks your CAMp gets an upgrade with a ‚Äúnether portal‚Äù like entrance.
---
For high strength builds that have no perception your basically forced to capitalize on explosive, shotgun, or heavy wep dmg.  I've been killed in one shot by numerous rifles and what not, at least high strength players can play NW without having to run around with a hammer.
---
I've also taken down ppl weilding gaus shotguns using some of the lowest tier weapons
---
Awwww we got a white knight internet hero here &lt;3 You are still not gonna get any

Dang, AN ENTIRE TWENTY THREE DIFFERENT TYPES. ***LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE!!!*** They fucking tried to make an MMO, these complaints are all standard practice in many online games. Get the fuck over yourself, this isn't Fallout 5. It's not co-op Fallout 4. Stop expecting it to be like other single player games. If it was easy to get everything, people would actually quit. The people who quit because *the games too hard, boo hoo* aren't the audience they are trying to build, or the majority. There's probably like 80% of the community that doesn't know this subreddit even exists, who enjoy the game. The fucking nerve of them, eh?
---
I really am but lord the anxiety when I see the little eye thing that someone‚Äôs watching after they‚Äôve died. I‚Äôm like please don‚Äôt judge, I never said I was any good!
---
In where did I imply or state that I camp in bushes? Lmao the people on this sub are wild with their assumptions.
---
Its even worse to near impossible if youre low level .
---
We're lucky if the legendary doesn't disappear before we get there, maybe work on that first.
---
Some people don‚Äôt intend to fill it all the way up, but want to build more parsed out structures or creations. I‚Äôm 100% for increased build area because of this.
---
I like going shopping and asshats build ugly mountain bases that result in FT cliff falls which break your legs or leave you miles UNDER their base. Seriously it's not hard to avoid this for your customers. It's not intentional either- they're just shit builders.
---
Well crapola! I read (probably here, actually) a while back that it was and I unequipped it and never went back to check. Oy!
---
You can use the improvised repair kits from Queen fights as an alternative
---
How much is really required to repair level 1 wood board?
---
Not just that but also every decision, from minor to major, is centralised and micromanaged by senior management. 
---
Once you've worked in a company that does this kind of thing, it's very easy to spot externally. 
---
For example, all the CMs are only allowed to do three things:
---
1. Give encouraging comments on positive experiences "Wow! That's such a cool photo!"
---
2. Gather information for the dev team
---
3. Tell us that they'll pass on the info to the dev team but give no specifics beyond that.
---
That's it. Everything else seems to require direct approval from PR or senior management. 
---
Why do you think that the CMs are so absentee compared to a lot of other gaming communities? Why is it that very simple questions to answer or issues to deal with can't be dealt with immediately but instead often come up in Inside the Vault or official Twitter posts days or weeks later?
---
It's self evident what the reason is.
---
If the CMs are affected this way, I wouldn't be at all surprised that the dev team is also micromanaged by management too.
---
Why else do we get decisions that are seemingly made by people who don't play the game and have no idea what the player experience is like? Even inexperienced devs are not this incompetent and tone deaf.
---
The sad truth is that without a significant change in senior management, all these bad experiences outlined by the OP and that we all know is just going to be the norm. CMs will be toothless and mostly a waste of space for the player base and there will be time and again mind-boggling and tone-deaf decisions made, some of which MAY be walked back weeks later if we push back hard enough. This is just Bethesda now.
---
&gt;Am I just a lemming in their eyes

ah, one more people realized it

Wait, wait wait!  I'm the only one that liks to change the floors to something with straight lines, and then spend literally minutes trying to get the alignment perfect, and then placing it as close as possible to other displays??!!

I cant tell for everyone but I guess it is just u. What do u want? Log in and see 3 legendary in front of u?
---
I roleplay as a BOS character so I gift them brotherhood recon rifles, 100 .308 and resistant brotherhood suits lol
---
just clear wixon once and do it with all that low level crap thats around and the mobs drop.. then scrap it all with the scrapper perk.. no?
---
it shouldnt take long or much material loss that way...
---
No, its still murder.  Do you not understand what murder is?
---
Are you PS4? I've been looking for some of these.
---
I did this with repair kits from SBQ fights.  If you have wood armor those are cheap to repair
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Its fine but that does kinda suck though

What exactly do you expect them to say if they haven't found/fixed the issue internally? "We are investigating" is the only honest thing they can say at that point. They can fluff it up a bit talking about all the things they checked that it's not, but all that is just going to be fluff to anyone who doesn't know the system. And if you don't have a solid handle on the problem, it's impossible to have an ETA that you didn't just pull out of your ass.
---
The last big dupe issue where they shut down vendors, they put out an ETA on what they thought was a fix. They turned out to be wrong, and got raked over the coals for *that*. It's damned if you do and damned if you don't.
---
Adrenaline isn't working anymore.
---
When I did it with a repair kit it didn't count
---
Greedy/lazy ü§î I've always thought of Bethesda this way
---
25, most of the way to 26. Done all my (non-NW) weeklies so won't be making any more major jumps this week, just what I get from the dailies.
---
Super awesome dude!
---
I feel that if the player base just played instead of looking for the next cheat or shortcut we'd have less 'bugs' and 'fixes'....
---
Wait how did you get nothing replaced from the scrap box debacle? Did you never submit a ticket? They more than made people whole for that one...
---
What about that little Liberator that claps out in the main WL quest? Sacrifice right there. Hopefully we'll get it as a pet later on, as pets are kinda leaked to be a thing in the future
---
26, but only doing the dailies I want. Easier to just pay.
---
F'n rights
---
Your loss. It‚Äôs like any other form of media or communication, from the written word all the way to Reddit. While there is a lot of detritus along the way, there is also a wealth of knowledge and experience and useful information.
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate you choose to restrict yourself from such a useful resource.
---
It isn't that hard to find nine creatures and kill them. I managed it in two matches. I think we have better things to complain about.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Adrenaline's fucked at the moment.
---
Fresh lvl 0 toon 6 kills and made it 2nd 
---
You just have to play aggressive ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I must be one of the rare ones, I have a ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù weapon and am aware of it. I just don‚Äôt use it until the queen health refills. Gives everyone time to get damage
---
I love standing in the middle of a few cars and blowing them up, only to emerge completely unscathed.
---
Still working on getting a good picture out of it.
---
that's true..the calm before the storm!
---
... I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve got some sort of Psychic mutation, or what. You just perfectly described how I spent a good two hours today rearranging my CAMP. 
---
...were you watching me? I thought it was Mothman again.
---
There are a number of places where spawn is pretty common. If you've played more than few times, it's fairly easy to find them and complete the challenge.
---
Its nice you make that money, but alot of players dont and cant or won't part with that kind of money for cosmetics. Especially with all the shit thats been going on in the world these last few months.
---
For some people 90 bucks is what they take home for a days work after taxes and what not.
---
r/wardhate
---
I agree but not just legendaries. Should be any corpse.
---
I actually quit doing the daily quest grind awhile ago and I'm much happier. I figure I'll be playing it for awhile more so why bother doing stuff I don't want to do every day.
---
Yeah, I make a lot of things to sell on there.  I have the max allowed vending machines.  So it makes it real hard to find what I need to restock when I have no idea what was purchased.
---
This is a big request for me since they put in the machines.
---
EDIT:  Hell a heading on the personal terminal would be perfect.
---
39
---
I know adrenaline broke and is still broke but nothing about gun fu being broken
---
Morgan town I have an set spawn where I have 10 chances to find a large crate every round if no one else spawns around me
---
The car explosions are the best e plosions in the game.
---
Forgot... Building Team.
---
I have three cabins with giant neon letters above the doors on the outside.
---
One says home.
---
One says crafting
---
One says shop.
---
99% of people madly run into the first two like headless chickens before ‚Äúfinding‚Äù the third one.
---
Yeah. and for them to die and i get credit.
---
&gt; What do you have to say for yourself, Ward? 
---
"Finally, someone with the guts to help".
---
It works on any heavy weapon, provided fire rate is 200+ and you have the right legendary effects
---
I would rather still be getting atoms to buy what I choose which cost exactly 0.0
---
I just fixed the weapons and armor I was carrying and cleared the challenge.  
---
One option is to pick up weapons/armor from placed locations, almost always needs repaired. If you have high intelligence most all your kills will have repaired items.
---
I got that once had to reinstall the game to get to work
---
&gt; if they wanted pve to exist along side pvp, well to be bunt that part was never realy going to work.
---
Yeah I don't mind PVP, but I don't like games that mix it with a story mode that has PVE.  I don't like being in the middle of an interesting story quest or gathering crafting materials and then suddenly be blown to hell by another player that I happen to run into.    
---
I prefer PVP to be an entirely separate mode where PVP is the sole purpose. That's what NW is. Blowing each other to hell is the whole purpose of the mode.
---
Forcing people into NW mode to help get score for Season rewards also isn't the point of NW and yet here we are...
---
I replied before in that topic that was asking for a Dragonrend shout of sorts to keep the SBQ grounded, us Vault Dwellers putting our heads together would have come up with something like sonic towers (or something like that) around Fissure Site Prime and thereabouts that will activate and drive the SBQ to the ground by now, for melee users.
---
God no it takes 5 hours just to install an update.
---
I used to think that a lot of the bugs were the result of weird and hard to track down issues, but after participating in the PTS for Wastelanders and seeing bug report after bug report go completely ignored and witnessing big, game-breaking issues that had been reported repeatedly by players go live without a fix, I've come to the conclusion that it's not that this is a complex game, but that Bethesda's developers are **lazy**, they are **incompetent**, they are **careless**, and they are **actively disdainful** towards the game's community.
---
Screw 'em.
---
Store the extractor and generator then you SHOULD see the CAMP module. If not, fast travel to another place like V76 then back. All else fails, relog.
---
Go home Biv.
---
I sell something incredibly common (not telling you what coz I'm quite a unique seller of this) &amp; I'm constantly amazed at how much of this I shift. I will say that it's because people like this for their display cabinets! It's common junk, but my best seller. It's not teddy bears. It's not teddy bears. It's absolutely not teddy bears üòã Yeah, it's teddy bears ü§ó
---
They could also just plop it straight into our inventories upon death of the enemy. That way, there is no issue with even having to find the body. Could even have a little misc objective tell us one is nearby, with the option to disable that in settings.
---
To me she said to clean up the Middle level from all enemies but when I did the quest did not complete. No enemy in sight...
---
Yeah give it a go, so far its money well spent not much to do in quarantine
---
Remember lemmings back in the day. So simple and so sweet LOL.
---
Have you played 1 and 2? It definitely gets rough on those 2
---
Being an ally is a journey.
---
I‚Äôm donating my reward to foundation.
---
The Raiders pretty much murdered / ruined about everything they could find.  They murdered Responders trying to help victims at the Top of the World.  They murdered everyone in Charleston when they blew out the dam and flooded the city.  They imprisoned Hank Madigan when he reached out to see if they would join forces with the Free States to help wipe out the scorchbeasts using their SDS tech (which they held for ransom while the scorchbeasts wiped out everybody in The Mire).   They also wiped out the Order of Mysteries.     
---
Not to mention half of them were elitists with David Thorpe who acquired much of what they had by abusing and oppressing the area's workforce.   At least David got what he deserved.  He killed his own mistress in the Charleston flood and ended up a scorched in the end.
---
today with the Kill 3 Legendary enemies, I completed it when i shot in to a bunch of ghouls. Didnt even realize one was legendary, but i never found it anyhow.
---
Its luck of the draw, for better or worse. I've had it pop and end before I could get situated and zone in, and also have seen it failed, both in the past week.
---
Rifle builds are much more deadly and have less counter play in NW than gauss shotguns btw 
---
And it's much easier to get a rifle
---
It‚Äôs a well known bug for PS4, they released a ‚Äúfix‚Äù for it, but it requires a reinstall. Even the. I still get it randomly.
---
It‚Äôs the absolute worst.
---
Happens to me a lot of ps4
---
Lol. . .
---
As Biff Tannen once said, " I'm gonna give you a nickel's worth of free advice".
---
If you can spare the budget, rug glitch the mf!  I forget how I got my cases to go in the last time, so I finally had to rug glitch them.  I think patch 20 "adjusted" C.A.M.P.s again.
---
Uhm. I fixed it. But also, do you realize how old this post is?
---
Can't remember but I just unlocked the Gillie Backpack.  
---
edit: just checked that's at level 32.
---
While I agree that some people rush to the end game, I've crawled to the end game since a little after launch and I'm already seeing that there is a vast wasteland void of content.
---
You might like to play this game mega slow because you know yourself that that's the only way to stretch out the small amount of content there is in the game but that very act in of itself shows a problem with a lack of content. If there was sufficient content, you'd never feel the need to draw it out.
---
You have to use imgr or any other image upload service unfortunately
---
31 and I feel yeah on that, it takes a lot of grinding especially when the amount it takes more each time to keep going. I mean I know it‚Äôs only week 2 of 10 but still it‚Äôs a hard road to do.
---
I believe I have an extra of that plan.  
---
I have IRL things to do tonight, so if I‚Äôm on, it will be after midnight EST.
---
If not then, then tomorrow same time frame..
---
aj-98 in game, aj ninetyeight PSN.
---
Not something Ive run into, I had my camp placed atop some water purifiers that got destroyed and it would just float above them. It didn't just clip into the extractor after you rebuilt it or something did it?
---
Instigating shovel. Just for the "spang!"when it makes contact.
---
VATS is trash right now. Plasma Caster, point blank pointing at the head, 95%, still miss. And thats with VATS helm mod and VATs 33% legendary on the caster. WTF?
---
Amen! Ffs I'm not an unarmed build why can't I get weapon stability or ammo weight reduction.... Or reduced muzzle climb... Anything
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/ZY4flDY
---
It is grape mentats. Berry mentats highlight living targets.
---
You do know you can put those in your stash, right? There‚Äôs only one that cannot, and you have to go extremely out of your way to find that one.
---
&gt; **Just a reminder that all of the newly introduced patch 20 bugs have not been hot-fixed and its been a little over 10 days with zero communication.** 
---
So... basically any weekday for Bethesda?
---
I just got the flying saucer thingy.  What level is that?
---
Eh the only reason more people are ally with raiders is rocksy thinks we do ni..ni...ni..ni..nice work.
---
&gt; we finished it...
---
At least you did ;)
---
Yeah. I didn't wanted to make a new post just for saying hey I've got a similar problem
---
I have been here since beta and can say I have seen little to ZERO evidence that Bethesda has given one shit about qty of items in an inventory. I have watched people drop 100,000 ballistic fiber in one bag or 10,000 plans in another. Even when the game was just out of beta I watched people selling god roll weapons at WS station for 3-5k each so many times it hurts to think about.
---
BTW most of these guys are still active.
---
Rank 67. It's getting a bit tiresome, though
---
Then you would have hated when each factions bots shared a 400 cap limit and you had to fast travel around the map to each faction and sell. It sucked. Now they all share the same pool that is still to low but better then a year ago.
---
Yep it was today. By the time I'd been alerted and hit join it was over. Never even got to fast travel. Wtf are people using? Silly me. B2525 duped fixer's.
---
I got that photograph, so whatever that one is.
---
Hi Todd!
---
Then you got me making new accounts so I can easily complete the level up challenges.
---
The whole lobby system is not very well organized. I feel a major. From being kicked back to the main teams falling apart not being able to organize perk cards enjoy the holotapes and terminals voting for a map... It's all messy
---
I'm a melee build. Take a swipe at every vehicle I pass. Best part of my day.
---
I can see rye you'd think that
---
Ah, thank you
---
They're waiting for your dropped ammo bag so they can painstakingly covert it over several hours... Fucking nefarious man... Dark shit indeed
---
I complained about it on twitter to @BethesdaSupport and submitted a ticket because that is always @BethesdaSuports response. And I didn't get anything. Almost everyone else did but I got nothing. I had to refill my Scrap Box all over again.
---
I'm open to any fixes that don't need a reinstall right now. Think I've lost out on today's challenges ffs
---
You managed to get it in two matches because RNG happen to favor you on that particular day.   Which is the whole problem with it. 
---
I finished the challenge in thee matches and it was pretty quick. So what? It could just as easily have been zero creatures in all three matches. It's a daily that puts you at the mercy of RNG.
---
And I wasn't complaining about it being difficult.  I was complaining because hunting for creatures isn't the purpose of the mode.
---
Yes, I can't count how many times I couldn't find a legendary like radroaches and other similarly sized creatures that don't poke above the grass. The only way to find them is to know exactly where they died down to a few feet. Make it like the code carries with a small auditory sound, or a gentle glow from the body. Just a tiny thing to help, but not overdue it.
---
Yeah. Somebody bought a single syringer ammo from me today
---
Haven't played in over a year. Came back and still have the same server instability. At the very least could that not be addressed?
---
they‚Äôre gonna tell you to take it up with the seller unless you bought it from a verified retailer
---
Somebot in Whitesprings usually sells them.
---
Just went through this. Took a relog :(
---
Imagine being level 25 and being told Sugar Grove has a lot of screws...then shooting wildly at Gutsies from the middle of the parking lot. It was glorious.
---
Yas. I‚Äôm on 22 and I just complete the ones that are convenient and go about my business. No burnout here.
---
You have my attention. How might I obtain this unstashable holo?
---
I‚Äôm a long time player,(not very good &amp; only lvl 90)
---
but just last night I was at Watoga station &amp; a higher lvl dropped a sack of dope plans of events I‚Äôve missed &amp; a few I‚Äôd been wanting,&amp; clearly they had no idea what I desired...
---
So I took the plans I didn‚Äôt know,&amp; left the rest of the sack for the next passerby,&amp; threw the person a few stims &amp; cranberry cobblers &amp; just the same,we heart emojied each other,I threw out a salute,danced the robot too show my excitement,&amp; was on my way.
---
The community in this game Is 98% awesome,
---
Too me at least,&amp; I‚Äôm thankful for it.
---
Glad you had a good experience as well!!
---
Stay Blessed,
---
Stay Healthy ya‚Äôll!!
---
I get a lot of camp plans from treasure hunting, might try your luck.
---
Claim Clams. Ultimate takeaway.
---
Honestly, hilarious and enlightening view on the game itself, pre-wastelanders was a shitshow (been here for two years now). Loved the point you brought up at the end about real life and how it shouldn‚Äôt affect the game.
---
Lots to unbox but still, thanks for the hilarious laughter.
---
Have my angry upvote.
---
I can take or leave legendaries, just let me turn an arm into a megabuster that runs on my fusion cores, or like swap out my jet pack for a howitzer you have to brace yourself to shoot that binds to the grenade throw (because how are you reaching into your pocket/bag/etc. in a suit of armor).
---
I.e. they don't seem to care about making power armor more tanky so just let me weaponize it damn it
---
If the RNG is based off of user entropy then it's technically your fault XD
---
Have level 20 on one and 19 on another. The grind is not terrible, but it definitely wears on ya for 2 accounts. But, no sports on TV, most places are closed at 9pm during Covid, so "game on" I guess!
---
Noice
---
Eureka!  It turns out that the C.A.M.P. module had in fact sunken into the ground when the structure it rested upon was destroyed by that uncouth Jackson's Chameleon.  Thank you; removing the structures allowed me to see it and move it to a much more advantageous position.
---
Who decides that? Well ima have to pass this on to the team my guy
---
What? 
---
Yes ps4 comes with a mic, does the majority in fallout use it? No.
---
What is your point?
---
'later this year'
---
Hahaha.
---
It turns out that it had, actually!  After following SuddenlyCthulu's recommendations, I discovered that it had sunken into the junk pile itself, but not far enough that I couldn't grab it and extricate it.  Good call, nukejockey, and the crisis has been averted!
---
Fireproof, Adrenaline, and Actionboy are 100% broken right now, the game is fucking unplayable, how about if you break perks bethesda you give us an actual fucking way to relocate perk points instead of leveling up 20 times.
---
200 hours 289 levels
---
I think the locations where you wind up are fixed.  
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nukashine
---
&gt; It was so bad that it turned some people off of not only Fallout, but any future Bethesda game. 
---
This is so true. I'm never purchasing a Bethesda game ever at launch or at full price and only after it's all the reviews have come in.
---
I have zero hype for Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls games.
---
That's not possible though. Not since you could stack bobbleheads, which they changed.
---
If you ever decide to make the move to Xbox, let me know. I have a ridiculous amount of extra plans. I try selling everything for 10-15 caps, and i *still* have way too many....
---
How about just remove the script limit completely?  Everyone can empty their mules , turn everything in, and then debate whether they want to spend it or just let it sit on the account.  There's really no reason there needs to be a limit.
---
I did all mine with repair kits.
---
Same reason we all of a sudden have to repair 10 weapons instead of 4 or need to kill 9 creatures in NW rather than 3; they can charge $1.50 a level to skip legendary ranks of course they're going to limit your ability to do it for free.
---
Well placed sarcasm commenting on the amount of people complaining on the subreddit?   
---
Your comment here has nothing to do with "Keeping updated" and everything to do with you wanting to write a smart ass comment. Be real. If he has criticism of the game and makes a post you have no need to read it or make a smart ass comment. As I said that has nothing to do with keeping you informed and everything to do with you telling someone what they should do. ACUTUAL POINT!
---
The raiders at Crater are Diehards, all the raiders you refer to were Cutthroats. Two vastly different gangs and cultures.
---
Appreciate your work on this. 'Tis useful.
---
Ya thats not how it works actually, your probably playing the game on drugs. The gauss vats bug is the oldest bug in the game, its why no one ever ran a gauss rifle in this game unless it was a hitman. And when you fire out vats the rifle locks up which means you cant pip boy, you cant heal, you cant reload, character just runs around locked up. This is why theres tons of nonsense out on the forums cause people just making shit up.
---
I haven't until the Legendary Run started and I wanted to hit that repeatable xp challenge. Before that, I was still hitting a level almost daily without any specific xp farm, but I didn't feel the need to get it every day.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äòdedicated‚Äô, but we usually do 1-2 Queens per evening.  We hit Radiation Rumble and Arctos Pharma when they pop...we aren‚Äôt the best, but we complete them more often than not.  We aren‚Äôt specialized for Encrypted, but again we‚Äôre working on it.  
---
Play evenings US time.  IGN ShinyKittySurprise.  Always looking for people that enjoy this aspect of the game.
---
Sometimes when your rich n fukn crazy you do these things. I make a living fuelling these guys so please encourage the ammo burn....
---
Pro tip, put your camp beside a spot where legendaries can spawn and let your missile launchers do 90% of the killing for you.
---
You can get adhesive for repairs often without evfem leaving your Camp.
---
Simply cook up some Vegetable Starch using water, mutfruit, tati and corn. Then scrap it for 2x Adhesive. It doesn't get any easier.
---
/u/sirachillies
---
I noticed red asylum outfits exploding on the market. Suddenly everyone has one of the rarest things in the game.
---
small legendary's does so count no need to go after big lvl ones.
---
30 and feeling the same way
---
Apparently a lot of people run super low charisma builds
---
Itd be nice if I had a chance to win legitimately. I keep having score challenges completed before I log on. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt seem to upset since I‚Äôm left having to pay to win now.
---
I really hope Bugthesda gives people score that they lose , been working for me but can imagine the frustration when its not working
---
How is it?
---
Oof would love to but the time difference is too much :/ its 0.50 here :( but i will defienetly add you just in case our paths meet :)
---
Thankfully on PC you can mod out the store being the landing page, Id assume it's one of the first things most people do.
---
I think the economy‚Äôs demise is greatly overestimated
---
Sometimes its a great experience but most of the time its very underwhelming.(Especially when you see "Rewards:" pop up)
---
I just wait a few months and it comes back at half price or so. Just have patience my man
---
32,767 health, people can definitely one hit her
---
Edit: Hell, even two or three hits is ridiculous
---
So sorry!   You‚Äôll find your team.
---
I‚Äôm over it. I have to hit the repeatable dozens of time to make up for bugged challenges auto completing. Seems like a waste of time just doing circles trying to get enough xp.
---
Hope so :) but its not your fault im just happy you even asked me :)
---
Great. I guess I‚Äôm going to just start spending 100 off the top to keep from losing it.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs because of ‚Äúinventory tracking is hard on the server!‚Äù
---
Damm u stole my signature comment , take my upvote sir
---
It certainly is annoying how praise of the game or disagreement with someone's bitching gets mob voted down because some people just want us to hate the game and ditch it like they keep saying they're about to.
---
level 80, hope one day i encounter the mothman
---
Unyielding is pretty worthless for ranged builds. The only real good it does is boost carry capacity and increase xp gain. Bolstering is much better for bloody builds.
---
Same people bitching about legendary run being impossible to complete. People need to actually play the game
---
you telling me if i acquire a T65 arm i could be airborne ?
---
lol or you can say f'it I just landed the heavy gun of my dreams and will gladly grind back those perk levels. Oh and plus H: Furious Fixer W: Offers :)
---
... except for the SCORE Challenges. You better squeeze those out faster than poop through a goose if you want that chicken coop and skull mask.
---
I‚Äôve been lucky enough not to get that bug. My condolences, that truly sucks.
---
ya your probably just not paying attention, its on all platforms its the oldest bug in the game. I play on xbox and pc, its on all platforms, its always existed, if you dont notice you probably shouldnt be even speaking on whats a bug and whats not a bug, this is why PTS is fucking nonsense, get a fucking team of dedicated game testers like everyother AAA studio.
---
I rarely see them too but if I make an INT team, people are very quick to join.
---
i mean... have you ever thought the economy was good? the new dupe looked pretty limited. one dupe per server, and then they got to buy it back with caps. if anyone is going for bulk that would be pretty tedious. and does anyone past level 150 or so even buy anything from other players? i'll my gear comes from my own rng and i've only stopped into vendors to complete daily challenges for months. the economy will be largely unaffected. and it seems like the first ban wave hit pretty quickly after the dupe went public so I think beth is going to go hard on these glitches.
---
If on Xbox, I'd drop by constantly.
---
I would rather fast travel directly into the Overseer's house. I don't understand why, while doing the daily Photo Opportunity, I have to do a full loading screen to get to the house and then another full loading screen to go inside.
---
I have a house, a shop, and a deer stand atm
---
That's when you melt everything before he can tag it
---
That's the problem with this game. We need more fun things to do. This Daily Grind on top of Grind, on top of Grind, is really old! It's a game it should be fun!
---
Scripmas: 24 hours of no scrip limits. Ease the burden on your stashes, mules, and the servers by getting rid of all those Nocturnal Broadsiders!
---
Crazy part is, this would actually work extremely well. 99.999999% of items Purveyor hands out are trash anyways so this wouldn't even have a huge impact on the endgame loop. The fact that doesn't happen just shows Bethesda is more scared of losing a handful of players than they are interested in getting EVERYBODY to play more. Because that's exactly what would happen: a massive spike in playtime for most players, with just a handful giving up because they got the "ultimate" gear and "beat the game."
---
Close to the same. 340 around 1500 hrs
---
It's pretty wicked. I am a stealth commando build with no shotgun perks and an A2525 Handmade. Rolled an AA50 Gauss Shotgun on my second try. With no perks, it does twice the single shot damage as the Handmade. Single shot for anything except Scorchbeasts, which it is not nearly as effective against.
---
It been happening to me every day now. I‚Äôm not logged in at all, I‚Äôm at work and not even home. It‚Äôs something else causing it. But yeah, there response was we won‚Äôt do anything. They just want us to pay to get to the end. What other reason do they have to no make any attempt to fix this.
---
That's pretty rad, dude.
---
Yes it possible and easier if u have a private world
---
Good old times
---
I bought the brick one for a newbie yesterday at the watoga vendor in the cranberry bog.
---
In reality - two underpaid dudes hideously overworked and an empty office whose resources got committed to projects not being endlessly whiteanted by people who haven't ever played this game.
---
I put the spawn near the store. If you wanna check my base out that's up to you.
---
I have a private world, how do you do it?
---
The daily is the same as a weekly, like what?!?
---
It most certainly got better, I decided to finally get it after it started going into positive reviews on Steam, I guess wastelanders did it for most people.
---
But it's far from "excellent" or "perfect".  
---
I enjoy the game, but there hasn't been a day (yet) where something wasn't broken, something didn't work as intended or something didn't frustrate me. 
---
Yet I still keep coming back, mostly because I've only just begun over a month ago. But that will not last forever and there might come a breaking point, even for me, who stuck with ESO from beta even tho it was just as broken as this, maybe even more, and every second quest just didn't work... for over two years.
---
When was the last day you had a nice session where most of the things "just worked" ?
---
I often get that blue screen and error code. My solution is to put in another game. Play a bit then you can put your FO game back in. Usually works. If not, then you have to reinstall
---
In GTA V they have an awesome menu interface that lets you see previous prompts and stuff. I wish 76 had something similar, not even from a "what was that text that popped up for 1 second before I became thirsty" standpoint, but boy do I often forget how much i sell stuff for in my vending machine
---
I never had much trouble just spamming 6 or 7 of one chem in a row.. I prefer Alcohol, Mentats, Day Tripper, Psycho and Daddy-O. The minuses come out to -3 CHA and -1 others so it's pretty manageable

4 damn hours just to break even on what was taken. I feel like they don‚Äôt care and just want those affect to pay to win.
---
You can get the small backpack without doing that. 
---
And you don‚Äôt need to revive someone you know. Just go to an event or follow all the new low level people around. When someone inevitably goes down, revive them. 
---
Done.
---
Games as a service model is literally designed around you spending money via micro transactions.  I think people would feel better about it if the game was free to play.
---
I shutter at the thought of the next elder scrolls being GaaS.
---
Yeah, do another challenge instead. 
---
Although if you keep an eye out Encryptid, it‚Äôs a perfect place to revive someone random.
---
This is this cutest fallout comment I‚Äôve ever read. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Yup.  I don't see why so many people care so much. The best weapons will still cost too dollar. It's not like you need a god tier weapon to be drastically OP in this game anyways.
---
I definitely understand the joy of speedrunning, there's something special about achieving a point of mastery that you are trying to approach perfection. But if you're going to speedrun something, it's pretty silly to complain about not having things to do considering you intentionally skipped them. And this is a game that's not really made for speedrunning
---
The fact it wasn‚Äôt tested at all is shame. They just throw things out with no quality control whatsoever ever.
---
You can criticize something and love it at the same time That is how it and you grow
---
-Strat-Edgy or Mandalore vid
---
But only if you actually know how to craft the Jetpack mod for the T-65, otherwise it doesn't show up
---
Don't run headfirst into everything and treat it as survival first, shooter second. Stay in the forest area until you actually know what's what.
---
Understandable. It happens. But I take the good with the bad because this game is too good to hate it.
---
I love posts like this that make me laugh
---
Thanks man! Gotta claim those clams. Haha.
---
The cap limit to me is reasonable otherwise you would just carry millions of caps, buy multiples of everything in-game &amp; flood the economy. The capping of caps is a good thing. Why would you even want more than 30k? Nothing in the game even comes close to costing 30k. 
---
As for Dev feedback, that comes to us by way of Patches/Updates.
---
What I do is go to a station put a weapon on one of the suitcases with unlimited space cuz they don‚Äôt count as your stash then leave the world and switch characters go to the same station and the weapon should be In the suitcase
---
if you're on xbox i don't mind dying for you. And i am sure someone on ps4 or pc could help if you're not.
---
I usually stick them all in my shack, but now the temptation is real to move one inside my house to my kitchen cause who doesn't want a dancing donut robot in their kitchen?
---
Sorry I‚Äôm seeing this now. They fixed it?? Idk what‚Äôs happening. Thank you for volunteering to help me, anyway
---
600 hours to reach level 200ish? Do you just hunt animals and cook in the game?
---
Sbq also
---
Certainly! But every time i log onto reddit this page is full of negative reviews. I just don‚Äôt see it. Too many things are being asked for this game but complain about the crashes.
---
I checked last night and there is no baseless version. It also doesn't snap to other foundations. It's extremely similar to the way the "Seedy Shed" is with its non removable foundation.
---
You can't stack the train cars and they won't stack on other things.
---
Gotta revive someone for the large backpack.  If you are on PS4, we can plan a meetup where ai blow myself up and you can revive me. Let me know.
---
Also, the Paradise, Encryptid and Radiation Rumble events are good for finding people who need reviving during the heat of battle.  That's how I got it.
---
Sounds risky but this isn't exactly a god-tier roll so I might give it a go. Thanks for the help!
---
Well played :)
---
People love to hear their own whining. Then they get all pissy when you don't agree with them.   
---
They love to cry and act like someone's holding a gun to their head when there are hundreds of other games they could play instead. Their real goal, of course, is to hear their own whining and pretend that it makes a difference.
---
Wrong sub
---
Just unequip your unyielding set, make sure all your int buffs are gone. Craft a level 1 board and hit something with it. Repair and rinse and repeat.
---
We‚Äôve had at least 2 other weapon dupes I know about, economy was fine then and doomsayers were going nuts saying eco is completely dead, but it always comes back.
---
Don‚Äôt underestimate the price gauging or the 76 community
---
If you need easy legendaries just do the leader of the pack event in the nw corner of the map. Super easy and gives you 3 low level 1 star legendaries and you can get like 15 scrip when you're done
---
If it's not obvious where they are, I leave. Too bad, I am often hovering near max caps and looking to dump some and buy things I don't want or need. On to the next camp!
---
I‚Äôm going to try uninstalling tonight and downloading it again. Maybe a file is borked somewhere. But I don‚Äôt think that will help.
---
üòÅ never underestimate the power of a Mr Fuzzy Gold Tie or a Radbear üòÅ
---
U have about 5 minutes before the private world resets so I do it quick and I would do it first with a regular weapon just to be safe
---
Want the bullshit answer you're going to see from most of the replies here?  "BECAUSE BETHESDA WANTS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THE SEASON SO YOU WILL SPEND MONEY!"
---
Want the actual answer?  They just picked some random numbers or literally have it set to generate a random value between some range on it's own.
---
You're complaining about it because we happened to get the low value ones before we got the high value ones, if we'd gotten repair ten weapons last week and then today got repair two weapons this thread would be about how nice it is that Bethesda is making the challenges easier.
---
Things that cost "0" dont count towards the score challenge thoughü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Gotcha will do. Thanks.
---
Great idea. Thanks!
---
Encrypted is even better.
---
Us beta players had it worse. There were people posting just for the upvotes knowing the hate would get it. There is still a slew of haters but there are always nuggets of useful information here once in awhile.
---
Those who love the game have it hard in general in these communities. Got to have some leather skin to be here.
---
You right my guy. Totally spaced on what sub I was on.
---
Get shooting things and dont use weapon artisan so you can chain repair. Make sure to use your cheapest repair cost item or just use repair kits if you farm the queen to death.  
---
*cries in 30 lbs of repair kits*
---
Also I believe its luck that gets found weapon condition and intelligence affects crafted gear.  Correct me if I'm wrong though.
---
No problem bro I do it all the time hopefully it works for u to
---
Well if you‚Äôre so smart, figure it out yourself, Einstein!
---
Look for PA frames.  They tend to always have pieces that need repair.  Also vendors may have low quality weapons for cheap.
---
You have to revive someone. It‚Äôs not avoidable. The avoidable piece is whether or not it needs to be in water.
---
My favorite thing happened again today. Fighting legendary Wendigo inside a building. I killed it wil my Heacy All Rise (Melee). The very second I killed it and before I could claim any loot, it completely disappered through the floor. I looked in the floor below and outside the building. It was gone. This has happened to me many times in the last month. Drives me crazy.
---
It‚Äôs like those romantic relationship where they are always on breaks, cheating, talking shit about each other, but keeping running back to each other.
---
Yeah, from my understanding it's certain stock weapons that could drop for anyone at anytime. You could get one off a drop right before the queen pops, decide to try out your new toy, and melt her. Calling them an exploit or glitch, even if someone is consciously using them for the bugged effect, is  just shifting the blame from bethesda at this point. This has been going on for awhile and it's still not fixed. It's just another insane thing going on in this game that hasn't been addressed. And extreme damage builds, like bloody boosted by consumables, is playing clean. We may not like it, but it's another thing that's been going on for a long time, and the game is built with multiple layers that support the build. It's crazy, but in all honesty it's the build with the most support from items and perks in the game. It's like the developers love bloody builds. I wish energy weapons got as much love.
---
I got tired of the daily grind and decided to go on other games because I want to actually have fun not have another fucking job.
---
Seems the new dupe was more heavy on consoles this time than pc for some reason
---
I mean they totally trust and love my raider gal who just waltzes in every day in raider clothes wearing a real human skull for a mask as she takes pictures to give to the raiders... I'd say they are a little too trusting if anything...
---
Yesb I think the market is donescap for at least half the year, everyone gonna have op weapons
---
I just love that this guy drunk buys in FO76. Does it keep you from making bad drunk purchases IRL?
---
thanks for the offer but im currently playing on pc rn.
---
you get the full plans from completing the BOS questline
---
Awesome! Glad you found it! :D
---
Did I need a Mounted Dog Head plan for 39 caps? No. Did I buy it? Hell yeah I did.
---
U got banned for duping
---
What about the stuff you are wearing / in your inventory?
---
thanks for offering to meetup, but im currently playing on pc sadly,
---
That freaking trapped bus at Whitespring gets me every time for some reason

Every time I forget.

no, you can place the paint, it'll give the visual of the jet pack but doesn't allow you to fly like one.

Lol Bethesda doesnt answer to anyone

The savage divide (which top of the world is part of) goes up to max level. Because of the relatively early mission that will send you there, they lowered the level of pleasant valley/top of the world - its now always scorched, and always low level.
---
However they only lowered the level for that area. Stray too far away and you're back into the "normal" savage divide which can spawn max level. Its not uncommon to find a sheepsquatch down the slopes from TotW
---
Right so. I can reply now. A lot of them waste resources of some kind. You sure you're okay with that? Being forced to buy or sell. Shocking.
---
Power armor doesnt count oddly enough.  At least it didnt for me.  I hadn't repaired my X01 since I got t65, so I thought, "score, I'll just fix it up for storage and get like 6 free hits", but nope.  Didnt count.  Luckily some of my weapons just break in my hands, flamers, so I just had that running hard today.
---
Not suprised eith no communication it's been like this day one
---
I bought the game about 4 months ago and play just about every day.  I haven't spent a single dime since that original purchase - and won't until the next content heavy DLC that contains actual story.  This is not a hard thing to do.  I honestly don't understand how Bethesda is making money on the atom store.  If something is really really cool, I'll use the atoms I built up just by playing (almost 6,000 by now, with 4,000 left).  I just dont understand this business model.
---
You can edit your body post now and place that link inside, this thread will get bumped down and people won‚Äôt understand what you mean. Just a friendly helping hand! (If I was a mod I‚Äôd fix it but I‚Äôm not.)
---
Best of luck on finding out the issue as well!
---
Turn your mic on and ask in an Events or Building random group. If nobody is answering, hop groups until you find someone. It's an easy ask and I would do it if you asked me.
---
They won't answer. They dont read this stuff anymore. They used to when the game first released but gave up under the avalanche of problems this game has. 
---
Il help with some answers, it was basically a cash grab for starfield production costs and was made entirely from fallout 4 assets in a blind rush ( like fallout 4). The team you think are a team are literally two idiots in a office keeping the dream/lies alive until starfield emerges and the gaze switches. Ive said before that everything in this game that should be generous and rewarding is the opposite and was designed as a time sink for big spending whales to keep the game making money until starfield releases via 
---
the hated atom store/system. Private one player worlds are a cost luxury despite Bethesda being hypocritical on single player experiences now. Its a fucking mystery why people persist or is it? Bethesda wants the same hours people put into the more sandboxy standard fallout games to apply to 76 and its pay to play /win system (that they said would never happen.. repair kits) and that's their motivation in this. The problem is this game is a pile of reworked shit that is running on an ancient engine that was never designed to play multiplayer anything. Janky, slow and with bugs that have been in every game they have released since morrowind.
---
 That is the problem mate.
---
That's not how any of this works... you don't have to be "registered" for an event to even see the SBQ, she's just there no matter what.  Sounds more like you've got a shit connection or system thats lagging,
---
I think like 23 with me missing a day and maybe one or two nw
---
Ok. How do I edit my post
---
I second this
---
After this weekend you can scrap them for scrip
---
I find it that some do that with the vendors so you have to go through their house, like they wanna show it off.
---
 36
---
Line in the Sand is your friend.
---
Pretty burnt out tho. Using the calculator thing, as long as I complete dailies and weeklies, I can skip the NW and even XP at this point and still make it by dropping a few hundred atoms.
---
&gt;kill them before they kill you
---
Well, sure. If it was always that simple.
---
Meg and her people are less bloodthirsty than some other raider gangs. Not everyone at the Crater feels the same way though. And 'less bloodthirsty' doesn't say much when she'll still string someone up or kill to get what she wants. She just doesn't kill for fun or out of psychotic rage. They still made her a more friendly face to lead the Crater raiders as opposed to say, the ones in Nuka World.
---
Takes 90 secs max to dupe  B2525 fixer or whatever else, and you buy back at vendor level, so 1000 caps say, no limit per server. So do 30 in under an hour easily, open some of the 30,000 or large gifts on your mule, repeat. That's a lot of rare stuff in 7or 8 hrs. Not really limited
---
I used 10 repair kits, I have over 100 and finally found a use for them.
---
Just make your own int. Even if all you get is your own +1 that's better than most. They will surely join.
---
I agree the game is great and deserves appreciation, specially with Wastelanders stuff. I believe most complaints don't come from hating it, quite contrary, they arrive from frustration on most things that diminish it's playability. People want to play it and enjoy it without severe limiting factors. 
---
Sure thing, bugs exist almost in every game, but this one has some bad decisions on top of those... If I could, I would play it every day, but sometimes when I actually have time to do so, I get to the point it's impractical and pointless, with stash or currency limits, for example. 
---
Playing this game is great on many aspects, but often the journey to get your character where you want isn't limited by your play time, or skill, or effort, but by silly decisions that are sometimes seasoned with abnoying bugs.
---
thirded
---
finished since last week
---
I'm definitely buying more plans from people
---
So bummed my ps plus ran out for the month....
---
I should be at 29 or 30 by the end of the day I think.
---
I ran into that once, I crossed the river to the west and just kept walking and the forest just kept going and going and going. Nothing out there but forest and gentle sloping land. It was really cool.
---
Eventually I noticed that if I stopped walking, the collision on the ground wasn't working anymore and I started falling through the floor. This was well after passing the edge of the in game map (was just a little dot beyond its borders). Then I fell through the ground and it didn't kill me so I fast traveled home. Luckily that worked.
---
Not sure how I managed to do it but this was a few months ago. On PC.
---
Friend has it and got at least temp banned
---
You should have stayed for the mobs half hour of chaos üëç
---
I agree that action boy is the better of the two. And I'd rather have better criticals and bloody mess over grim reapers sprint if you dont have enough points in luck. But with adrenaline being broken you should have points enough to fill up luck for now and get all of them.
---
Dont give up hope - it is totally worth it. Just visit those hard events and just wait a little - it will happen.  And this is coming from a solo player who is lazy as hell.
---
basically it is just a pat on the head for fans
---
Yea, just like the last half dozen dupe waves killed the economy for good.  
---
People need to stop assuming that every other person playing the fucking game is duping the shit out of everything the can and making everything worthless.
---
Except like, the games not an MMO and Bethesda love the casual players and want them to stick around because they drop mad money on the shitty cash shop. Bethesda also sold the game as an enjoyable singleplayer experience OR co-op fallout 4 with friends so like. Bethesda's only target audience is however big said audience they can possibly get they don't care about you outside of you playing the game and dropping money on it.
---
Ward's quest has been bugged for me from day one. I just walk up to him each day, and already have the missing item somehow. Sometimes I tell him I had to kill someone to make him feel bad but I've literally never had to do the actual quest. Not complaining. Basically free rep, scrap and caps.
---
Someone on PC wanna be a proper legend and die for them. 
---
Also. If someone dies in water and you revive you can get part of the swimming done as well.
---
Same here, though that was in part due to a bug my main character has that gives me Ward's quest every time I log in, and automatically finishes it when I go see him. Also I finished the 79 quest about a week or so first on that character. My raider is still about halfway through Neighborly, even the raiders technically have one extra reputation daily quest.
---
I came back for it, and have been enjoying the hell out of the game once again. I‚Äôve accepted that I probably won‚Äôt hit rank 100, and I‚Äôm completely ok with that. I‚Äôm satisfied with whatever I end up achieving.
---
EDIT: Yay negative downvotes. That will teach me to enjoy something that I‚Äôm apparently supposed to hate, I guess.
---
Why have I never seen this?!
---
I've seen a hundred of these posts, but not a single one with "bethesda replied".
---
Another vote for shovel here. I keep one for the "buried with honor" daily (now it gives scrip) and its great fun for panging things with.

I like the ultracite gatling laser - its a handheld light show

Check the church near the graveyard in the southwest part of the Forest. Kanawha Cemetery I think it is? Try in the evening. Look up at the church tower.

Or do the event at Landview Lighthouse, but you probably know that one. üòÄ

What is this power attacking with melee thing you are talking about?

Xbox here. I'll team up and help you bub. DM me and I'll send you my GT.

Just be glad you didn't buy it two years ago. That was a lot more yikes.
---
I'll sell you 10 damaged weapons for a B2525 HM or fixer. i'm not fussy.
---
I'm gonna be Frank here.  They all kick and scream about how the economy is ruined because of duping, or because of char locked weapons that represent the best and now no one will want their trades. And blah blah blah.
---
Give it a week or two.  Maybe three depending on how long the stashed items stick around, and everything will be back, and you'll not be able to get anything good for anything less than your immortal soul and your next of kin.

This happens every now and again and it comes and goes.  Just wait and this will be the same.

Okok :)

Whoops, wrong sub üòÇ  Any help still appreciated
---
Same....and I typically also execute the raiders after convincing then to join Foundation lol

Yes and they're nowhere near Fallout 76's level.

u/valseek u/ladydevann please rework that. OP is right

I can make you one for free for now if you want

I actually bought it cause of the new dlc. Idk if I even started it yet. But I have 30 hours so far after 3 days!

I believe you can only unlock one reward from each holiday per day. Did you already get a reward from the Halloween event today?
---
I got the prize just after the flying saucer playground for your CAMP, so whatever that is.
---
I‚Äôve been here and could say the same. But it‚Äôs also because they have duping accounts that will churn this shit out. When they are on sale for like 8-15 bucks or free weekends. I‚Äôve seen a few mains get lost out of the handful of people I know. But it didn‚Äôt mean much as they had at least three accounts filled with items. Many use spreadsheets to keep inventory. Still. You register a certain number of items you get flagged. I can make a weekend out of opening 100k Christmas boxes. But I bet your legit items it‚Äôll get banned.  I wish They just put a shelf life on them but dated. Between those, moleminer boxes and the compensation boxes. I hear the third one gets you in trouble 100x faster. But a week after those came out everyone was handing out Materials. Though duping is far lower on the ban hammer compared to matrixing items out of code. I find it just as bad that communities pretend their clean. When places like 76 and filthy casuals are as dirty as the rest. So at this point purging the cheaters would be like half the tiny pc user base.

Silva homestead. Go to the house behind the field, and look for a mysterious package.
---
It‚Äôs part of the pawn shop questline, but there‚Äôs no indication to go here or to 4 other locations. This is the only one that gives a holotape, and Bethesda made each item here a quest item. You can fulfill the quest for the others by putting them up on the pawn shop board, but the holotape doesn‚Äôt go, and is thus forever bound to your inventory, much to my annoyance.
---
People are far more likely to engage in and support exploiting and glitching if doing so makes the game more enjoyable than the default experience. Which is exactly what happens here.
---
It only went and worked, nice one!
---
also a big mac and large fries
---
I got the ultracite prototype paint from the atom shop, but couldn‚Äôt use the set (which is aesthetically my favorite) since the shocks are impossible to get and I would be over-encumbered every time I got in the PA. I realized I could craft X-01 legs with calibrated shocks which are easy to buy, which happen to be the same exact color as the ultracite paint when crafted. Looks great and I can actually use the ultracite armor without praying to RNG for the shocks
---
So people don't bum rush it. They want maximum play time and/or money.
---
How does making a new characters help you progress through the score map. Every character has its own score count doesnt it
---
Obviously the person in charge didnt finish math class.
---
You can change your in game name in your account settings once every 2 months.
---
Damn there goes my dream of a boxcar skyscraper. Thanks for checking
---
It took me 6 hours to get 9 creatures on both my accounts. I really hope I don't see that challenge again. 3 creatures is manageable and mostly achieved in 1 or 2 rounds of normal NW game play. It also makes me suspect that creature spawns are changed during these challenges because I was dropping at bolton greens and Grafton steel and no creatures or other players spawned/dropped there at all.
---
Boring as fuck faction is ignored, honestly if it wasn‚Äôt for the outside golf exchange why would you go there?
---
you're optimism is impressive. i'm keeping up with the run... but i wouldn't sing it's praises. it's intent is bait-n-switch cat-fishing that most game models are trying to incorporate. give you the illusion of free content and cosmetics placed behind a heavy grind. no new content here, just all the challenges/daily fetch missions that have been in the game forever. and something that forces tedious repeated grind every single day is not a game, that's work. and the end goal here monetization of paying to progress. fallout 76 has been massively profitable, given that most assets were copy and paste from fallout 4. they didn't design a game from scratch. looking at 8 month old data, 76 had already made a profit of about 700 million for bethesda. they are probably close to a billion if not well over it after wastelanders. todd will be getting a massive bonus this year, just as he did last year. it always strikes me as odd when folks bring up the profitability of massive corporations. i promise you, they aren't hurting. and new content is coming regardless, we'll never a dlc as massive as wastelanders again, but they want to fuel this money training for as long as possible... until they switch focus onto another money train, you can calm your worries about lack of updates.

Ahh, robotic romance. She's got a cold touch but if you program her right, she'll love you for life. Or at least, you know, adhere to the directive of human relationship algorithm as instructed. She's a sweetheart, that one.
---
If they do this, I certainly hope it isn‚Äôt legendary...
---
I use a glowing meat pile mod specifically for this reason. All my meat piles glow bright purple and that blend in with nothing, so they're super easy to spot. 
---
Bethesda could just simply add a glow or a small beacon of light to all legendary corpses/meat piles and it would be an enourmously helpful change.
---
You didn't notice 320 plans wtf ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
If you happen to be on PC there's a mod to help with this.
---
Yes you can! When you're on your main menu look for the social tab and if you and your friends are on main menu you can invite them to a team. Then when teamed up you'll be given the pointer to play nw with friends
---
I've done that thing hundred's and hundred's of times
---
Sadly mine was Auto complete
---
Was the same on ps4
---
People who are satisfied with something rarely come to tell you how satisfied they are with that something.  Probably because they are too busy being satisfied.
---
Yeah Bethesda didnt gear this towards the working mans friend.
---
Can i join you?
---
I have a funny feeling I may not be welcome here, but I for one am stoked for BOS camp items. There are some tire barricades and stuff in the atom shop but it is more Raider/Military or like minutemen/military rather than regular military.   
---
This is a much older build of mine but my attempt at a Military style checkpoint.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/iRqatF2](https://imgur.com/gallery/iRqatF2)   
---
I plan to make a new one when BOS stuff is out.
---
Yeah but doing that would have them raise the limit. 1.4k a week is way to small for someone who DOES log on daily so they could do 5k a week or keep the 1.4 a day but make it account based like atoms so it is a cap of 1.4 untill you deplete that then 24 hours after you deplete it, it restocks.
---
Never knew
---
This really is my favorite daily challenge. Probably never would have started buying things off people without it.
---
Has happened to me a lot lately, the only fix I have found is relogging.
---
Maybe you can move the ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù folder off the C drive, mine is on the D drive.  Might just free up enough space to work.  Google moving user folder to another drive.
---
Same... Only I'm level 185...

All those missed atoms bc I thought my crits were broken...

Ikr. They should just glow that green shade even while they're dead

A number six with extra dip

Good to hear

Think I saw brick building plans at the brotherhood vendor inside the whitesprings resort. If it wasn't that one I'm sure one of the vendors in there has it - I was going from vendor to vendor looking for metal building plans and I'm sure I saw it on one of them.
---
Yup pretty much, honestly taking away our ability to get atoms from challenges really killed the game for me, I‚Äôm playing a lot less with this new update. They just made the grind worse and took away more of our choices, you can only earn about 150 atoms each week if you do EVERY single challenge per week, it‚Äôs terrible

If you get a Quad Assaultron Head and fully charge it up you can blast vehicles. It won‚Äôt blow em up but it‚Äôs neat dishing out 10K+ damage

I recently decided I don't care about anything in bullion shop. If I eventually get it, ok. Otherwise, I'm not making the same 5 bullion quests my full time job. Much more fun that way.
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt think to try one in the wild. Okay, at least it wasn‚Äôt just me and there‚Äôs a way to work around it if it happens. Thanks for the reply!
---
A lot of it is conditioning from other games. Most modern RPG and MMOs lead the player around by the nose. Follow the quests, see everything and at least in the case of MMOs, the end game is where the real game is.

Bethesda's open world games are not like that though. I can't tell you how many times I heard people complaining about Fallout 4 and how hard it gets too fast, only to find it's because they have only done the main quest and nothing else, or think because Preston gave them a quest to help a settlement on the south side of the map they have to do it right away. Exploration and getting lost in side locations has always been the big part of Bethesda's games. Both in terms of what can be found off the main quest path, and because they expect you to do side stuff to prepare for the quest line.
---
With my Raider character who mostly sat idle until Wastelanders, I've mostly stuck with just doing the new main quest, leveled from 20-60 just on that and dailies and there is so much I've not yet done with that character.
---
I had gone basically the whole game solo with Lone Wanderer and so when I started joining public teams that 20% damage reduction buff became really really noticeable. Might be worth looking into some of your perks if you are on teams?
---
Impulse buyers. Same reason why stores have candy and pop right at the checkout. It doesn't matter if 99% of people are smart enough not to buy it, the 1% that do is enough to make it worthwhile.
---
Also, you have to realize there is a lot of younger kids playing this game. Maybe not children, but definitely early teens/young adults. People who might have their first job, and no bills. Or people who haven't yet realized the value of their money. These people lack the self control you get as you age, and are the prime target for these impulse buys
---
They can always be a formidable opponent but your issue here maybe you are encountering the glitched ones. Some times they never cool down, never stop to charge and the beam can register a hit no matter where you are. In this case, they can be certain death if you aren't strong enough to push through them.
---
I really like it too and it gives another thing to do in the game. Though it certainly can be improved. Hoping Bethesda listens to our feedback on this.
---
The touch of a woman?
---
Joking aside I've never done that personally. (silos in a row, not touching a woman. honest). I don't mind doing a silo run but them being all the exact same definitely puts me off running more than one.
---
I don‚Äôt know. I was having similar issues the other day where I‚Äôd pay to join an event and fast travel to it and when I‚Äôd get there I wasn‚Äôt allowed to participate unless I went back to the map and tried again. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt try it with Scorched Earth specifically, but did with various smaller events like Bots on Parade, The Giant Teapot quest, and Leader of the Pack and saw this same issue despite a great, hardwired Ethernet connection.
---
So I have this same bug, sounds like you killed someone else‚Äôs target and looted the item, now you will forever get it see you have our item‚Äô every time you talk to ward
---
My buddy and I took down a 3 star Legendary Scorchbeast, but used a plasma weapon for the last hit and it disintegrated without us being able to find the body
---
I chortled at the part where you took your vendor away.  THAT is funny.
---
Do you do the mirelurk meat turn in? I didn‚Äôt know about it till I was almost done, but it‚Äôs a little bit extra Raider rep.
---
I just wait for Uranium Fever to start. Even if you just get a tag on it will count.
---
I use it as a periscope when I'm hiding underwater and roleplaying as a submarine.
---
We‚Äôre never gonna S.C.O.R.E! XD
---
The **Path to Enlightenment,** my friend. That's all I will say :D

I personally wanted to thank the dev team for giving Nuclear Winter full lobbies again. It is very nice not having to wait for matches. Keep up the great work.
---
- Tesla Rifle, esp automatic version 
---
- Crossbow
---
- Fat Man. Switch your perks around, craft up some mini nukes, and raise hell
---
Hundreds of ghoul tourist's and locals flood into the pools and you have to clear the park collecting their entry tickets for a Croctron that runs the ticket booth. The bot of course has a willy head.
---
neat. i still don't care. anyone massively duping that much has already been banned. and if not, the second or third wave will get em. and again, i haven't bought a weapon or armor from another player since i was low rank. these weapons won't be selling for under 1000 caps in personal vendors... so it's not like everyone will be buying them. and it's not like there's a shortage of op weapons already in the game. i have several build options that make me damn-near godmode. and that's just rng. this dupe, as the dupes before it... doesn't affect the game for me in any way what so ever.
---
Cranberry mentats!
---
Watch this end up being a legendary perk option
---
Beavis and Butthead reference?
---
I hope we get Cait's and MacCready's outfits. MacCready's would look awesome with his duster and ammo belts. Would fit real nice in Fo76
---
Happened to me earlier with "Encrytid" and I started the event with my one and only free card. It just would not register anyone participating and nothing started - no spawns at all, I tried everything I could think of, including travelling into the event once it was on the map. I figured it was either broken or I was being dumb, solo I'd have been wrecked anyway so I guess it saved me that experience at least
---
I get around this by simply not giving a rats arse about what other people have, if they want a god roll weapon then whatever
---
That's what it sounds like to me.  My guess is op is also seeing players running in place or stuck at lvl 1 on the ui as well.  I have noticed some increased server lag today but I guess it is friday isn't it.  So my money is on serve lag. 
---
It concentrates on sbq like always though.
---
They‚Äôll likely never respond to a post or question like this. They get input from the community from dozens of places and only the stuff they hear about from like everywhere will they consider, and it‚Äôd have to be very constructive in for them to give it strong consideration.
---
Like my request that buying legendaries with scrip you should be able to be more specific. Like I said be able to buy a Legendary Combat Shotgun for 125-135 scrip, whereas you get a random weapon for 100 scrip.
---
Even if they just narrowed it to a chance to get a double barrel, pump action, or combat shotgun so I can build my character around my perk cards rather than keep trading in legendaries.
---
I‚Äôm still using that Level 10 Anti armor Hunting Rifle because I can‚Äôt get any better
---
Their poor parents' credit cards.....
---
Dont forget the broken flamer mods!!
---
Doesn‚Äôt change for me. Never been much of a trader since you can‚Äôt do it in game. Too many people get screwed over because there‚Äôs no way in game to perform trades for items. Theirs no viable currency in game
---
I‚Äôve played since launch and have zero complete sets of armor. I pickup pieces that are improvements and use them but don‚Äôt care what type it is.
---
PC here but I sell instruments plans for 3 to 5 caps.  If someone is looking for them on Reddit they are free.
---
I'm a lore junky. You have my attention. Hehe
---
You dont get a placable diploma through that, the closest I can think of was a nuclear winter reward that has long since passed
---
Don't know why people are down voting posts complaining about this. And I see replies saying "Adhesive isn't that hard to find."  That's really missing the point.  The point is you are having to consume resources to repair something that really doesn't need to be repaired.
---
I repaired ten weapons with repair kits from the queen.   But most of them were only 10-20 percent damaged.  I didn't repair them because they needed repair. I was repairing them to complete a daily.    It doesn't matter if the resources used are plentiful.
---
It's still  a waste of resources because I used them to repair weapons that really didn't need it. .
---
Wait, there was a plan for this?!?
---
Aside from the fact that knowingly and unknowingly and consistently releasing new game breaking bugs into production (which is fucking insane) and that no hotfix is possible which alone deserves its own blast, the least they could do is communicate honestly and empathize and drop the pr doublespeak that pretends they do not have massive internal issues for 5 minutes and enable one of the cms here to say in essence the following:
---
"Hey guys we know tensions are high and everyone is super eager to get in game and play the new SCORE system, but we have some news and thoughts we would like to share:
---
- The new duplication glitch has been under investigation since reports started showing up last week from a well known Fallout 76 Youtuber and a few players in-game. This process is highly technical and wrought with its own challenges. That being said, the team has been trying to permanently resolve the duplication bug and other exploits that enable future duplication bugs to exist, and are relying upon your support tickets to help them reach a resolution as quickly as possible. If you see or suspect users are obviously abusing this exploit, please send a support ticket with as much evidence as possible to help us identify and punish users taking advantage of the current situation. We have the senior development team and support staff working on this particular issue 24/7 and have approved overtime for the weekend to make sure this gets fixed as quickly as possible. I know it seems like nothing is happening behind the scenes, but trust me we are all taking this as seriously as you are and it is our top priority as we are all active players as well. I cannot speak as to whether we will remove the tainted items from the economy or if it is technically possible, but I will forward your thoughts to Todd/pete/the business intern making these decisions and ask them to review their plans based on the community feedback we have been receiving. 
---
- The newly introduced Patch 20 bugs are being sorted by criticality and volume of players affected. As you can imagine we are stretched thin especially with the new xbox game pass promotion/pts and upcoming patch (but we are hiring for many technical positions so please apply if interested). In particular, the biggest bugs like the SCORE system not rewarding points or auto-completing is currently being tested by QA and ideally we will have a fix  by Monday/next week/with the next patch. Additionally, Adrenaline and other perks being affected was something unintended that we saw no likelihood to occur based on the changes in Patch 20 and as soon as the SCORE and duplication bugs are resolved we will be moving them to the top of our priority list. Thank you to all the loyal players who wrote serious mathematical breakdowns and took their own time to test and publish their findings. 
---
- As a way to let you know we are trying to be better, actively listening, and as an apology, everyone will be receiving 500 atoms And/or 5 ranks worth of SCORE. We love how passionate you are and realize that the current situation betrays your trust in us and above all, we do not want you to feel that way.
---
Rest assured I or one of the other community managers will be working diligently to keep your confidence in us and well informed and as always we appreciate your patience. Please stand by..."
---
Boom done. Bethesda has always subscribed to the say nothing and it will blow over mentality and it usually works, but when you run a live service game that mentality is fucked and leads to posts like mine.
---
Are you *really* a fearless bitch though?
---
You mean like the feedback that sunsetting sucks? Lmao
---
Wait... what?  I could have been earning atoms by doing crits?  Well, now I AM mad.....  that is, if there were decent rugs and drywall options for interior ceilings in the store.....
---
That's cute
---
&gt; Any chance you could upload your ini? Might be the reason a lot of game pass users are getting the same error. 
---
E:\\Program Files\\ModifiableWindowsApps\\Fallout 76
---
In there should be a file called Project76.ini, open it and copy the text and make a file in   
---
%userprofile%\\Documents\\My Games called Project76.ini and make it read only. Let me know if that works
---
Also it seems like you might need to do this every time.
---
Bethesda went harder on Fallout than Disney did Starwars. Imagine if Disney took Starwars and gave it to their newest least experienced and smallest studio. Thats what bethesda did with Fallout, they literally just dumped one of their biggest franchises into the cash grab bin. The perks that were broken with the latest patch, Adrenaline, Actionboy, Fireproof, there not gonna get fixed, the team is too small, the engine is running with multiple patches on yop of eachother, if something breaks ita broken forever. The focus was on the Atomshop, now its gonna be on the seasons. With Fallout the goal is using the already built fanbase to cut cost and increase profits, its the oldest model in business. Like this same studio made Nuclear Winter and thought it was good, sorry guys, ya'll created the worst Battle Royale currently on the market, it was just a cash grab. The majority of bugs cant be fixed, its best to do a little research on the development of Fallout 76 and how all the top programmers thought bethesda was bat shit crazy for using this old ass engine, they said it would be a technological achievement to get it to work, and they never did, the game should of never left Beta.
---
The junkies railway is the best.
---
I went foundation, because the two gun guy wanted a 50% cut, I'm completely against people who are as greedy as me.
---
Marsupial &amp; Speed Demon means I spend most of my time trying to jump to the top of everything. I do tend to forget that I also can't jump \*from\* everything. I've had a few too many deaths where I thought I was a Mario only to discover I'm a slightly jumpier human.
---
YES! I do not want a quest marker in my face saying "hey the enemies body is right here" until I loot it because I may not want to loot it but give some extra at least! Like mark it on the map and compass like our last death point is marked!
---
Depending on what you enjoy doing in the game, other people enjoy doing other stuff. 
---
I like to burn through quests, so then I have more time for exploring and scavenging, and doing dailies and events. 
---
We should all play the game the way we want to play it, at the pace we want to play it. As long as we are enjoying ourselves, who cares?
---
The game not registering that I‚Äôm in the event has nothing to do with my connection, their servers are just garbage
---
Haha true. I guess I ment in game. And yeah, with the speed run I do its mainly the getting the keycard, fly though the hole in the roof and across the silo, do launch prep. Each took maybe 8 minutes plus putting in the code
---
bSkipSplash=1
---
That's really missing the point though.   I repaired ten weapons today because the daily said that I had to.  Not because the weapons needed to be repaired. The ones that I repaired were only maybe 10-20 percent damaged.    This requires you to sink resources into repairing weapons that really don't need to be repaired at all.  I don't care how plentiful or how easy to get those resources are. It doesn't matter.
---
All I have to say is.....FINALLY SOMEONE WITH THE GUTS TO HELP!
---
Avoid the dupe and do your own deal!
---
Yeah, they had the x crits challenge for atoms pop up occasionally for daily and weekly. I've been hoarding atoms bc you're right, there isn't enough good CAMP stuff to drop them on.
---
New rugs would be great!
---
Edited. Thank you!
---
This is a good solution and is already implemented in Bethesda‚Äôs other MMO, so you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be no big deal....
---
Thx to Bethesda‚Äôs exploitsüòÇ
---
Or the should make it to where legendaries glow green even after death with that green smoke coming off as well
---
Don't forget about spawn locations! Doing research on where people spawn to your camp may make it easier too!
---
My daughter and I's favorite thing to do right now is to wait outside the vault, drop a bunch of free stuff when we see a new player, and then R U N down the stairs and out of sight as fast as we can. Like ding dong ditch, but wholesome.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I can run the silo's fine, killing the queen is a different story, some days she drops dead and it feels like every round did considerable damage, other days theres 5 of us firing our best weapons at her for the full 30 minutes and shes only just regenned by time the event ends and she flies away
---
And jumping. It's people jumping around and running everywhere. Is there a "jump 7600 times in Vault 51" challenge I don't know about?
---
Not a problem! Gotta help out everyone! Again best of luck, and if all else fails, submit a ticket to Bethesda with proof of it not working.
---
How much do you sell them for? I have bears for sale and nobody buys them.
---
Haha thanks for taking the joke in the manner in which it was meant. I was only playing. 
---
That a "glitch" strat is it? Know nothing about them honestly, I've only ever done the runs "properly" at like 15m each.
---
"More a suggestion for PvP; as this would greatly mitigate the effectiveness of stealth boys."  
---
Isnt that what berry mentats are for?
---
How do you put the spawn?
---
My Guess is you have a lot of mods running and they have broken it
---
Oh my friend told me that he got the diploma and pennant from that mission with the overseer, and it made sense to me... graduate, get diploma. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
My wife had hers auto complete day before yesterday she was so pissed of of the next 2 days she grinded the shit out of everything she could using all the chems and perks she could think of and managed to get to where she would have been of she had completed the challenges herself
---
Guitar Sword did not work for me, at least the legendary one I tried.
---
I have this also, it's pretty great!
---
I really only have a couple of issues.
---
1. It's dominated by skins and flashy stuff. If they had included more functional items (not game changers, just stuff that moves eg clocks, flashing light etc or variations of ingame items eg more clean household stuff) then it wouldn't feel so much like a linear atom shop minus the choice. 
---
2. The massive drop in free atoms. Now I'm not saying I want the mass giveaways that some want returned but maybe a small trickle feed for each rank, say a measely 20 or so. Not only would it offset some of the hurt (and anger) it would also encourage people to continue their involvement even if they weren't doing it for the rank rewards themselves.
---
I definitely just give them away, if i see someone at my camp lol
---
First time i killed anything like that i filled my gallery and posted all over social media about it. I don't play with many people. So the fact i could do it on My own made me feel good. Congrats and happy murdering in the future!
---
Again, that's not how it fucking works.  
---
You don't need to be "registered" with the event to see the SBQ, she can bug out and wander as far as Watoga and anyone that hasn't even stepped foot close to the event to "register" with it can see her plain as day.  
---
If you're showing up to events and stuff isn't loading for you but is for everyone else the common factor here isn't Bethesda's shit servers, it's you.
---
I don‚Äôt play battle royal games at all outside this so I‚Äôm not really qualified to critique it compared to others. I do agree with your last two points though. As a sneaky/commando there are a lot of other perks I‚Äôd like to try in endurance or strength that I don‚Äôt have access to without creating a new character. Sure, I can do that but I‚Äôm just logging in to complete the SCORE dailies so it‚Äôs not worth it to me at this point. 
---
As far as the scorchbeast goes, I‚Äôd also say that not only do you have another high level enemy o contend with but it also gives away your position and makes it very easy for another squad to swoop in while you are occupied with the big bat.
---
Don't forget being able to nuke a zone larger than the safe area when you are in the final few zones. Just did that after finishing my 6 stimpack challenge. killed 5 of the 7 remaining players, no clue how the last two survived. It was really funny as the person doing it but it must be frustrating if you are on the receiving end
---
Indeed, I'm purely untradable armour (solar and thorn) and untradable weapons (all Guass). Just saying it's very widespread and will impact all aspects of the game, hundreds of thousands of apex weapons and armour makes a difference.....
---
Well ESO is under zenimax and I‚Äôm pretty sure is on a different engine to be fair
---
PC.
---
Mmmmm i think is luck and not inteligence that affects drop condition
---
You don't have to reinstall. 
---
Go to library &gt; highlight F76 &gt; hit options on the ps4 controller &gt; upload/download saved data &gt; do both, upload and download saved data, apply to all to save some time. 
---
If it doesn't work, there is a bug on the server side. Wait 24 hrs for the servers to reset then try again.
---
I really have no idea. I never got it. But people can place diplomas and pennants in their camps, so I just assumed.
---
Calibrated legs and emergency protocols.  Arms are useless for ranged builds, pick a helmet.  I use targeting HUD.
---
Power armor is generally one size fits all.  The only difference is emergency protocols or jetpack.
---
i started bash damaging stuff with a pipe rifle then repair it since bash does extra damage to the weapon.
---
alternatively, get a friend to pvp you and have him magdump your corpse before you respawn (damages armor) and repair the armor
---
They have been broken since Wastelanders was implemented and do not highlight any stealthed units.
---
Not me! I love positive feed back.
---
I have the Jester Mask, Bloodied Apron from meat week with throwing cleavers, looks pretty sweet
---
Do they actually do anything to stealthed enemies? I didn't notice the usual red aura effect on stealthed assaultrons yesterday
---
What‚Äôre you so mad at that you feel the need to start swearing up a storm? Get outta here with your negativity loser
---
I join random groups just to activate Strange In Numbers perk. Most random groups have at least one mutant. :)
---
Pretty sure any corn will do.  Collect some from other farms.  There is a lot of corn at the general's steakhouse, and more on a farm north of the nuka plant.  Also the aaronholdt homestead has a lot of corn.
---
It will take 24 hours before you can collect the corn in the same field again.
---
‚ÄúWith nobody to blame but yourself.‚Äù Now see I don‚Äôt blame myself, shivering isle from oblivion kept me playing longer then fallout 76. Why? Cuz there was a lot to do, that was when Bethesda still cared about making proper polished games that actually worked lol this game has about a weeks worth of quests, I don‚Äôt play the game to read books and terminals, I want quests.
---
It's not too often, though. I'm waaay up by the ammo factory, above that cave entrance to vault 79, or whatever it is. (I always forget... -_-.)
---
I completely understand and agree with everything you stated above. I love this game but it‚Äôs becoming very obnoxious to play. I get lucky sometimes with the purveyor or drops but that ‚Äúluck‚Äù tends to be geared towards items that aren‚Äôt really for me or my build. I then try to trade those items for what I want and can‚Äôt get anything I‚Äôm looking for (tried to trade a bloodied FFR +A handmade for the junkies equivalent and was told it wasn‚Äôt an even trade and I‚Äôd have to add more on top - BS). The game is frustrating and honestly so is the community. Doesn‚Äôt seem like fair trades ever happen anymore. Someone is always getting screwed. Dupers are out there mass producing the best drops only to sell or trade them for astronomical prices. Sorry but your 1000 copies of a B2525 fixers aren‚Äôt worth premium anymore - mass duping saw to that. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating to say the least. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt seem to care about the duping problem. Sure they patch it after it‚Äôs been used 1000s of times, maybe ban some burner accounts, maybe they remove stacks of items but let‚Äôs face it - the root problem is still in the basic code. Until they fix the lines of code that are actually broken, the same dupes will keep showing up over and over. Bethesda has stated that they would be more transparent and have a better open dialog with the community in their Inside the Vault newsletters and patch notes - this hasn‚Äôt really happened. At least it hasn‚Äôt happened to any greater extent than was already implemented. It‚Äôs ridiculous. This game isn‚Äôt TOP SECRET but Bethesda acts like it is. Having an open dialog with the community doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt still have secrets about future updates. Keeping the community informed about the current state of the game is what is really needed. I love this game but I find myself playing less and less which sucks. It‚Äôs all just getting to be a bit too much.
---
Narrator: "They then decided to add more nuclear winter challenges"
---
There used to be an old bug where having too many holotapes could interfere with a few quests. One of them was the Mistress of Mysteries main quests and it blocked you until you dropped all droppable holotapes. I only pick up holotapes for quest objectives as a result of this bug.
---
I wish we could grow cranberries in camp.
---
Make new saves, don't overwrite an existing save. Also, try to remove your autosave file from your save folder, just drag it on your desktop (as a way not to delete it in case you need it later). Then try to start the game :)
---
I am looking forward to the BOS as well. I used to have a camp in that exact spot with defensive walls and a guard tower, in an attempt to make an outpost. Anyways great looking camp I like the garage door at the front.
---
As the person who has been nuked many times, naw the nukes are awesome 
---
Sometimes I can hoard enough drugs and stimpacks to survive for like 5 minutes outside the circle 
---
Usually the players who launch a nuke like that lower their guard so I can swoop in and steal a quick wind
---
Feels awesome doing that lol
---
kill them first
---
You aren't imagining things.  It has been worse since update 20.
---
I don't have a single mod.
---
meh, i mean from what i see everyone has apex weapons already. i literally have to stand still for 5 mintues in the middle of sbq event before i go down. and that's vanilla game. that's how they designed end game gear. i could see it affecting survival mode if that was still a thing. but, out of this, some rank 55 player gets their first op weapon for 6k caps.... what do i care? they would have got something similar eventually anyway.
---
I don't see the bait and switch. The proposition is "you have access to as much free stuff as you have ability to access". It's free if you have the time, and available if you feel like dropping a few bucks. Revenue does not equal profit. And for a holding company with 2.5 billion in equity, they are likely to be heavily leveraged.  Their realized profit for the business unit attached to FO76 is likely closer to something like 10%. While 10% of the 100 million dollar development cost is nothing to sneeze at, that 10 million in profit does not fund much. Continued cashflow is the only way to provide for the future of the game. Given that this cashflow is generated from optional purchases, I have no qualms with the the model.
---
Purchase your levels or don't, but there is no bait and switch.
---
Build a knife. Kill something. That will damage the knife. Fix it again. Rinse and repeat. Mostly uses steel. Very little adhesive. Easily done. 
---
Don‚Äôt have any perks equipped that make the weapon last longer. Or fixed to 200%.
---
Way too much fun lol
---
I got lucky and revived someone who was also in water at encryptid.
---
If you want you can add me, ign lateraliss and I'll jump off a cliff or something and you can revive me, but I cant log on till about 1am central time since I'm working late tonight.
---
This is a reason that I wish energy weapons were actually good in this game. In previous games, I‚Äôd always go plasma because the goo is so much easier to find.
---
Ah me too, all the cranberry relish please
---
Maybe one day!
---
Yeah, been there, got yeeted even got the clip lol
---
I do every event i see on the map once i join a event team. Not just the main event like feed the people or uranium fever, but battle bots, distant thunder. But i like to get on a team and just drop a nuke to trigger the SBQ most of all!
---
they cant kill what they cant find (sneaky boi is safest boi)
---
edit: assuming your not a heavy gunner
---
Perks, like serendipity and dodgy help. 
---
I have a lot in stealth perks too, so I'm generally killing most enemies before they 'alert' other enemies. 
---
And then of course, damage perks to kill things based on your weapon.
---
Yesterday I was on a team with someone who ran into the storm during the impact and came back in with a rad suit after it landed.  So it is possible to survive if you can get out of range and back in before dying.  
---
The match ended with a 1v1, but the other guy was immortal and took no damage so....you can guess how it ended.
---
But how do you have good stats? Lol mine turn to garbage when I lose unyielding
---
Me too, they've missed the mark on some feedback, but I'm excited for what they do next.
---
Well aint that a kick in the head, i have no idea then buddy sorry
---
I forgot to make it read only and it still worked. Thanks for the help.
---
Edit: It only worked the first time I did this.
---
Sure. You are their focus group. Well done. I don't care enough to judge. But I can promise you, nothing about game design is intended as free to play. That's not a business model that actually exists.
---
Yep, guilt them into taking the bag.
---
its worked in the past, I have 9 points to spend but waiting for teh 10th so I can get frog legs.
---
Tried that one
---
27.
---
I just want the raider cage
---
I‚Äôm a commando build but if I‚Äôm bored I‚Äôll throw on heavy gunner perks
---
I am situated right across the Charleston Station. There are almost no attacks.
---
I'll tel you one thing, dont make it in the mire unless you like unwelcome angler house parties
---
Because I said it nicely the first time and you decided to shove your fingers in  your ears and scream about how it's all Bethesda's fault and how shit the servers are instead.
---
Murder them!
---
I‚Äôm trying to swap perk points to apply serendipity but being a level 209 doesn‚Äôt make that very easy lol
---
Preach dude. I understand some people are excited about their cool camp design and thats great! But please dont hide them in the back of your place and force the grand tour on me...i just need some ammo...
---
I was thinking the same, but figured it was me
---
Lol go eff yourself you petty immature inbred piece of trash
---
Agreeeeed
---
It was fun as hell doing it. I went into the match not expecting anything and got lucky enough with the nuke. I was killed before the nuke went off.Got shot in the back as I ran into the storm to escape my own nuke. You are definitely right about lowering their guard.
---
Bethesda: lol no we‚Äôre gonna have the corpse explode so you can never find the body. EVER.
---
Haha yeah irsh
---
That‚Äôs the thing.   Something like this should have been a feature from day one, instead we had to figure out a janky ass semi exploit, so that we can do it *sometimes*
---
Start acquiring unyielding sentinels gear.  Man that's gonna be a slog, I don't envy you.
---
Just go get them. Take the name, fast travel and pick it up. Most are just on the ground
---
I agree on both fronts, they may have done just as well by not replacing the old atoms rewards and just adding the score points to the set of challenges. I suspect they'd get a better response that way. 
---
I actually suspect that's what they do in season 2.  It has the PR benefit of "increasing rewards for normal gameplay" and increases activity in the atom store, which is a good way for them to advertise new stuff there. 
---
I'd actually like to see them do more engagement in the streamer and content creator community as well. Between iterating on their seasonal model and that, I'd bet they could increase revenue, allow more people to get more content for free, and better engage those with disposable income to spend it on content that feels a little less gratuitous. Win-Win-Win
---
I wanna be a mole miner
---
#FIIIINALLY
---
I am having the same problem.
---
Rofl
---
i would try going stealthy if you have the room, bloodied stealth commandos can put up some insane DPM as long as you can stay in hidden/caution,  crouching with the unyielding agi boost should help you stay hidden easier as well
---
Samwell Tarly?! Is that you?!
---
On that I won't disagree. Free-to-play does not equal free for all.
---
Naaa he was banned for not buying atoms or 1st
---
Yeah if you read his journal he says he‚Äôs hiding that‚Äôs he‚Äôs an ex raider
---
Yes, but have you invested in sneak perks and armor? I don‚Äôt mean useless Chameleon gear either.
---

Scroll to the right.
---
I'm a junkies build so it's a bit different. 
---
My carry weight is 400 in most armors, 500 in excavator.  
---
Since I'm heavy weapons, ap is only good for sprinting and being overweight.  
---
Endurance is not affected by unyielding (or shouldn't be anyway by description).  
---
Vats is no good for heavy weapons due to high ap costs so perception is not huge and my char is fundamentally blind.
---
Overall my stats are (I think anyway) S:18 P:1 E:4 C:2 A:7 L:8. And this includes withdrawl.  So if you rely on unyielding, PA is not for you.
---
Food can help with this as carnivore doubles effects of meat too, and scorchbeast meat is great.  Plus 6 stats per.
---
I should note though, that I can actually survive the Imposter Sheepsquatch headlaser from point blank.  So SPECIAL ain't everything.  I still do boat loads of damage.  When adrenaline is working it's even better.
---
What kinda pc? Was it from Xbox game pass? Might need to delete and reinstall.
---
If its from Xbox game pass its not supposed to work that way and there are many bugs.
---
I do this on a daily
---
What's better?  Dropping servers and doing it again?
---
Yeah well it's just not my choice for information. 
---
Personally I don't feel it is a loss, but thank you for your input.
---
i'm so tired of dedicating 100+ lbs of my stash just for crap i can't sell back due to the daily 150 scrip cap. 
---
whenever i get it down to something manageable, oh look, i'm at 1000 scrip again üò§üò§
---
I dont get into the whys and what fors..
---
just dropping knowledge.. dont shoot the messenger...
---
Nothing more infuriating than killing a 3 star legendary and their body phasing through the ground into the abyss
---
who buys these? next time ill think twice before scripping one. Coulda had 200 bucks instead of 40 scrip that came to nothin
---
But I need his wing :(
---
I sell them at 22 caps each. I allow that extra 2 to make up for the 10% tax, so I end up with 20 caps per bear &amp; I restock as soon as I sell.
---
Is it best to try to acquire a complete set or just one piece? Does the sentinel effect stack? I have a mis matched set of unyielding already.
---
I am having the same problem man and i've spent hours trying to figure it out. There is stuff about Porting forwarded and disabling the firewall for the game but it hasn't worked for me.
---
Those doesnt let you kill the SBQ in 10 sec.  
---
Just think 2 sec before posting, please, you are embarrasising yourself.
---
The fatman, alien blaster, cryolater, and broadsider got nerfed
---
I felt really stuck from level 5-20 too. The story and factions open up after you hit level 20. Just enjoy exploring and working with the starting NPCs. I like to do the casual public teams to find better loot in better quality, stopping by the events as they pop up is profitable for xp and legendary items. You can also gain experience for your character by playing as them in Nuclear Winter Mode if you enjoy the battle royal game style and want to go up a few levels doing something different. After level 20 you'll be able to contact the Raiders and Settlers to start working for or against them towards the main questline. They'll have daily's and faction reputation and give you a lot more to do.
---
Please tell me the fence pieces snap to each other
---
I'm east of Pleasant Valley in the Savage Divide. I mostly get Radstags and occasionally Super Mutant spawns that are usually levelled 25 or less. The Radstags can do a number on my crops but don't do much else.
---
The problem is when my Camp spot is taken, it spawns me at the Central Mountain Lookout and I get beat on by Blood Eagles before I fully load in...
---
Who knows, lol.  There‚Äôs a difference between a few bucks and this.  I saw a DE go for 350.  Insane.
---
It *just* works.
---
if in power armour use emergency protocol for a flat 50% damage reduction with a damage boost (pairs well with nerd rage) along with dodgy for more flat damage reduction at the cost of AP other good perks are blocker for melee damage and suppressor if using rapid fire big guns.
---
if outside power armour you need serendipity for a chance at total damage nullification, also works with ricochet, which while the ricochet effect is terrible it also nullifies damage like serendipity. otherwise like above, blocker and suppressor are good to haves. 
---
but the best way to survive is to kill everything else before it gets a chance to kill you...
---
I run an unyielding set, one piece with harder to detect while sneaking. I‚Äôve for the most part invested in most of the sneak perks. I don‚Äôt have mr sandman or just the general sneak perk maxed out but I do run them still
---
My standard one star bloody 50 already melts 200-300 per hit so I mean I should be fine with just that maybe should I look at a Chinese suit or think I should just stay with my armor? I just thought a power armor build would be great just because I have to sacrifice all stats / gear to do nuke events, but Chinese replaces all armor right?
---
I know I won‚Äôt make it to 100, with work and kids and life, but I will make it as far as I can and save the atoms I make on the cosmetics I want down the road. 
---
I appreciate that the new grind has made more people feel the need to play the game; even if they don‚Äôt like the reason they‚Äôre playing.  I‚Äôm just happy to see three, four teams I can pick from and some of them will even join your events.
---
Me too
---
I tried this for a time when I started this game. Rather than simply trying not to die, I suggest shifting the concept a little. Death is a great tool in this game. In some cases simply cycling a few respawns is a quicker way to complete a goal. 
---
It's something I plan and aim for occasionally now that I've had significant time in game.
---
I suggest you look into how to get all mutations at the same time. The first time I did that was the moment I realized death doesn't have to be bad in fo76.
---
Damn Straight
---
I'm at Level 25. I'm not worried. It's been a week and a half and I'm 25% through..
---
I've also missed some challenges in NW.
---
I played Uranium Fever about an hour ago and a legendary body seemingly disappeared. Eventually someone found the goo pile on the other side of the room from where it died. It was half hidden in rubble
---
I only did raiders for that sweet sweet ammo machine
---
Bethesda, please add basic things that are in every other game and should have been in this one since launch to this game. 
---
Why is anyone still supporting this
---
Should of put a flame trap in front of him while he was shopping.
---
Skimmed and I don't think anyone stated the obvious. One has been in since the game released. One requires a monotonous grind and was released only a few months ago.
---
It stacks, so you'll eventually want that full set.
---
I really wish I could say it would be different if the game had a larger player base. With a more people, and more money coming in, they would'nt need to shove the store down our throats.
---
But that's just not true. Bethesda would of done the exact same, and just made more money.
---
Oh wow. That is gold! Thanks so much. I must‚Äôve missed that one.
---
a friend sent me screenshots of that mass duped JE gat plasma, fuckin 700 on a certian site pre dupe,  now on the sub that shall not be named they are going for "ok" rolls.
---
i cant even imagine who would spend that much on a game weapon,  that's more than a weeks pay for people
---
South east of the Whitespring and south of a Blood Eagle camp, I think it might be the Vantage, there‚Äôs a pre-build cabin on a cliff that you can take a dirt road to get to. There only things I get there are the small frogs, opossums, fireflies, radstag, and maybe the occasional ghoul.
---
Yeah it's happening to a lot of people (including me). I saw one person say if you make the project76.ini file in (documents&gt; my games &gt; fallout 76)  read only then it works. I would try myself but I'm not at home atm.
---
Two number niiiiines!
---
They could add gold glowing sparkles around the dead bodies that have a legendary item.
---
I don't agree that unyielding should be removed,  but I do agree that it is the synergy between so many perks and mutations that makes low health builds click.  The trick is figuring out how exactly to use all of it to your advantage.  It is a difficult but rewarding road to perfect this playstyle.  The people that bitch about Bloodied builds are usually the ones who can't be bothered to learn and play such a risky setup.  They prefer the easier, high health, spam stimpaks and quantums approach.
---
Thanks for the tip, but it's too late for me. I quit a few weeks ago, but stick around the sub in case a miracle happens and Bethesda starts making good changes.
---
I‚Äôll definitely try out the power armor build.
---
Check for a driver update for your GPU. I'm using an older Radeon, and had the shiny textures as I called them, updated my GPU and it worked fine
---
Just depressing lol.
---
From what i've seen here on PC people have to make sure the game is installed on the OS drive (the Windows drive). Not sure, maybe something similar with xbox? Is your game installed on a usb hard drive, or on the main OS drive? Edit: maybe moving the game on the main drive rather than re-downloading it
---
So I just had this happen, i was downed, and miraculously was alive again, and I have no lifesaving modifiers on my armor...
---
I'm jealous, I can deal with someone launching a nuke but I've never once been able to find a nuclear briefcase 
---
I look for one every match too, I'm just really unlucky I guess
---
I even tried the perception perk that shows the briefcase if it detects one nearby but still never found any lol
---
Do you have multiple drive? People reported that switching the game to the main drive where windows is installed fixes the issue.
---
Main OS. Apparently this issue has been around for awhile. well actually I think If i transfer over windows to the other drive it might fix. we shall see
---
update: same thing happens sadly. I'm gonna try uninstalling and reinstalling
---
Wait so what's going on? This is so vague?
---
I‚Äôve seen that as well and I‚Äôve been playing for two years!
---
‚ÄúSkyrim v‚Äù come on dude
---
Sorry I can't be of much more help :( I hope other people make suggestions :(
---
It's happening to most people, Bethesda are looking into it. They (ladydevann - community manager)  messaged me from another post on here and I had to email them my ini file.
---
The entire legendary system is for this. 
---
Why let players actually get what they want? Then they might feel like they've "completed" the game, and move on. Better keep them right at the edge, feeling like the next one could be it. Just gotta keep up the grind. Maybe when you log in tomorrow you will get lucky.
---
In the room with all the rads there is a spot you can jetpack through the roof, than fly to the warhead itself, essentially dropping you from "find a way to lift lockdown" to launch prep in less than a minute with AP regeneration items
---
PREACH BABY! SOME OF US HAVE JOBS AND FAMILIES BETHESDA
---
&gt; Skimmed and I don't think anyone stated the obvious.
---
Trust me you're not the first one who had the joke go over your head. Also Wastelanders was part of the game from the very moment 76 went live on Steam.
---
I'm at 28 rn
---
Wait vault 51 is on the adventure Map? I legit had no clue lol
---
CSS replaces all armor yes.  So if you think stealth will be more viable, then that's your choice.  Power armor can generally take a hit, but also kind of has to.
---
Overall, assuming it's just for nuke zones, I'd probably go for CSS for the zone in your position and keep your armor for day to day otherwise.  Its lighter than a pa suit, allows for stealth, keeps serendipity and theres a reason most bloody builds run unyielding.
---
Also please note that my limited bloody experience is non pa, so my pa knowledge is subjected to a junkie mindset.
---
They should.
---
The coffin dancers want to know yor location
---
Stupid exploding gutsys. Getting themselves lost
---
Yeah, way up at the top left of the map though. It‚Äôs unmarked.
---
Thats about where I am...whatever the fireworks one is..  
---
No NW, and not all 5 dailys every day.
---
Where did you find or get yours? I have the same thing and just keep it for convenience lol
---
I‚Äôll probably do just that sucks jumping in power armor and losing all ability to hold wait and specials lol but if I can jump in a suit and lose stats but be invisible it might work better
---
The team working on the game could be outsourced and be located in India for exemple
---
Lmao. I'm a married lesbian. I've gotten more than you could ever, ever, even hope to *look* at. Come out of your comfort zone and think, you Neanderthalic platypus.
---
Ban us all? Nooo! My account!!!( jk I haven‚Äôt duped anything)
---
The thing is I'm not in it to level up I'm only there for the score. 
---
 I just leave on team play since thats 3 less people trying to kill me when i am just trying to complete challenges.
---
Interesting. It's a shame that the silo runs are so mundane with no variation, otherwise I wouldn't consider such a thing but honestly they're a bit of a chore in short order. Thanks.
---
Can it be entered? How near can I build my camp to it lol
---
shhhhhhh
---
This will never happen because, A. It is simply too easy, and B. there are tons of us who ritually and simply cannot pass up a group of vehicles without doing a chain of dominoes explosive firework show.
---
100 vehicles? Pretty sure I crank this out daily. Like to make the booms.
---
&gt;Got to have some leather skin to be here.
---
Or a good suit of power armor.
---
Sucks for them but people buying/selling weapons are breaking the TOS just like duppers.  Even worse really because they encourage duppers to do what they do.
---
Maybe reread the comment string before being a dick. I never said that. The person I replied to said 30k damage output. That is doable without bugged weapons or exploits
---
I am not seeing this on xbox at all. Is it PC only?
---
Could you provide a link to all the upcoming data mined atomic shop stuff? I used to google it but haven‚Äôt found any for awhile.
---
Well, that answers that.  Probably should take the post down lol
---
Answers all your questions about spawning

---
the golf club is a great place to reset item spawns as there's SOOO much to pick up
---
Use an explosive weapon from your arsenal. If you start from 100% condition, a couple shots make it repairable again, rinse, repeat. If you start from &gt;100%, you need to start the circle with a WestTek run or something similar.
---
Be sure to unequip Weapon Artisan, though.
---
I have mine on the cliff overlooking Harpers ferry, no enemies spawn or go up there. Except for a rare spawn of mothman and the flatwoods alien, which is once in a blue moon.
---
That‚Äôs about on track depending on how many weeklies you‚Äôve done.
---
Rare?
---
Probably, yeah.  To keep weight your probably have to use excavator with calibrated shocks to add 200 to your carry capacity, which if I'm correct will cover the loss of unyielding strength and deep pocketed if applicable.   And excavator is not particularly suited to combat.  It works for me day to day, but I also run full health.
---
People ask for improvements because they genuinely want the game to improve. The negative posts and reviews are not exactly unwarranted either. Nor are the positive ones. 
---
Instead of posting another negative thread like you just did yourself, maybe post something positive and be part of the change you want.
---
If youre high level youre gonna be able to finish if you log on every day and don't miss any weeklys/dailys.  
---
Might not even need to grind for the repeatable exp one.
---
Not sure but there‚Äôs still some pretty cool items throughout the run even if you don‚Äôt finish it
---
Can‚Äôt be entered, but you can build a camp practically right on top of it.
---
Nah, can't be entered. No idea on camp placement.
---
Hm I‚Äôll have to mess around I wanted to use a gauss minigun but ammo is so brutal so I‚Äôm waiting for a bloody plasma caster
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and the vendors are full of BE gatplasms and other legacies. Many high level players give away weapons for Free!
---
Hype
---
I went about it a bit differently. Basically I did the quest but forgot to turn it in and from the next day on ward never questioned how I already had his missing property
---
Totally agree, I think it would be awesome if you could go to Vault 51 in adventure and queue for NW from there, or else just manage your perks and explore the vault on your own time.
---
Those were atom shop items or maybe they were nw rewards. Either way, not adventure items.
---
I use my camera. Always helps me find them easier.
---
&gt;while wearing a Beerhat and being intoxicated with nuka wild
---
Wait, so this isn't how you do most of the game? Hmm, maybe I need an intervention...
---
Got it right after the patch dropped, had the item in my inventory cause I hadn‚Äôt turned the quest in, and it‚Äôs just stayed there.  It‚Äôs not a new thing, just relatively new.
---
Not anymore
---
I agree in principal. It is objectively the worst BR that I've played, and I badly want it be good. However, I still give it time occasionally, and have managed a few wins. 
---
I find i enjoy it more when I think of it as NOT fallout. Learning the systems and how to leverage them best is always an interesting goal for me, but that can only take you so far with something like this.
---
Gamepass version will only work if you have it on the same drive as your OS
---
Or just... don't waste your expensive ammo on legendaries.
---
So do sentry bots just cease to exist once they go nuclear?
---
I killed a legendary in vault 79 and it was nowhere to be found. I intentionally waited for it to blow because I get caught in the blast every time. Now I'm wondeing if you have to loot it before it blows.
---
I sell for 15. Maybe the demand is less on PC
---
The best kind 
---
They got built-in glowsticks for mad raves yo
---
I think this is the least of their worries at the moment lol
---
I once went to a camp that literally consisted of a maze and the center of it was were the vendors were
---
But I‚Äôll have to do each and every challenge ? Fuck me dude this game is a grind
---
This is how I played it with a friend originally, we both were lvl 90 before we dropped a nuke for the first time and I enjoyed every second of playing and exploring at our own pace and reading lots of notes and terminals that explained a lot of the lore and backstory which made me enjoy the quests even more. I know it‚Äôs tempting when you see other lvl 150+ players who have lots of good gear to just rush everything to get to the endgame but you will 100% enjoy this game more if you just go at your own pace and learn about some of the lore while doing quests and exploring/scavenging.
---
I‚Äôm at the side with either stage and I can‚Äôt make my mind up. If foundation turn into Preston Garvey afterwards it‚Äôs a big no I actually sent him to my fault to get rid of him.
---
Shouldn't that be bDisableSplash=1
---
I'm on 28 with only about an hour or two a night. Only missed the NW stimpack challenge and one other NW challenge that I don't remember.
---
I don't intentionally do the 10k repeatable and think I'll be OK reaching the end or near it.
---
Then fix the lag when spamming cook
---
Np, makes them worth the ammo with this shortcut honestly imo
---
I hate battle royales. I like nw. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
&gt;her drive it might fix. we shall see
---
Seen this too, and it is the dumbest issue to have. Happened with the original Borderlands on Steam... Sigh.
---
Maybe. However, it's now free to play so there'll be whole bunch of new players coming in. Keep some stocked up!
---
Comments in this thread are all rage, when one can simply ignore that challenge if they don't play NW to begin with
---
Gauss mini isn't too bad so long as you use it selectively.  For a daily driver yeah it's bad.  But I only use mine for sbq and showing off so I get good mileage out of it. I carry like 9 weapons so I have variety to play with.
---
Lol for real, I guess I could trade it for a pile of JE90 gatling plasmas.
---
It‚Äôs on all consoles
---
I can melt her in 15 seconds
---
I think that was me sorry.

You could finish but you'd have to grind like hell for XP.  You'd have to do a few NW challenges.
---
Your item is definitely more rare lol
---
Rare lul
---
I figure having a bloody of each type works 1H 2H Riffle and lmg but sometimes I get carried away with the minigun and waste 2000 ammo lol
---
Fuck me dude.
---
I found an AAE gatling plasma at the whitespring station today when I hopped on quick during my lunch hour. Also spent probably 5 hours last night checking train station and player vendors on different servers and didnt see anything lol
---
If you want to for sure finish it then yes. If you want to risk not finishing it then you can probably afford a couple more days of not doing it. But for sure play during the 2x score or exp weekend which i believe might be next week.
---
Edit: it looks like someone did the math for you. Please note I believe that one doesn't include the 2x possible which kinda cuts the time.
---
No, it's test server, not even staging or prod
---
Found a work around its in the main post
---
Oh dear friend! How can forget! I swap that barrel mod everyday I login, every server hop I make! Long and short, short and long, short as night, long as day, the days they spin and spuddle away..
---
I like maze camps but I found one while well south of sober.
---
It was fun, then frustrating, then hilarious, finally I realized that the camp won and I left. If I ever see that camp again I'm stopping everything I'm doing and giving it another go.
---
How else am i meant to kill them?
---
You can play a game and enjoy it, while also having valid criticism- those ideas aren't mutually exclusive.
---
I know this is gonna sound a bit biased, but bunkers are a great idea.
---
Riiiight right. I always forget which mentat does what
---
Just do a white springs run, got 3 legendary ghouls on a public server in one run. Not sure what the problem is. If you waste a bunch of ammo on a ghoul even a high level one, something is seriously wrong with your build. This is an easy challenge.
---
How so high?
---
Hey sorry I'm super late to replying (it got lost in my messages lol) but I actually meant a wallpaper on a phone. What's the best way for me to download that? Because the resolution in imgur is pretty poor lol.
---
You can also easily pass all speech checks with unyielding, have better stealth, more ap,  better charisma means better prices at vendor bots, have your accuracy boosted out for vats. Bolstering only increases armor and that's it...
---
i just hope, they can at least delete all that duped stuff, starting with the weapons. and yes, you may call me naive.
---
Level 27 here.
---
Other weapons, with cheaper ammo. I don't use an LMG anymore (for obvious reasons) but when I did I never used the LMG for PvE.
---
the only time i use voice chat at this point is to say *you there, come here, have some free shit*
---
A baton?
---
Honestly I'm wondering the same. I understand ppl locking water purifiers and colectrons but yeah if some could tell that would be cool.
---
You really want that one star trapper arm off that 3 star goul at Sunday brother‚Äôs.  At least it counted for my 3 legendary kills. P.S.  thanks for the camera Bethesda lol.
---
Something similar happened to me while I was on a public team (PS4). I also got messages that I declined invites even though I never received them in the first place.
---
It's doable.  You need max INT.  Unyielding would be a must.  Try to raise your INT to about 35+ and it wouldn't be too bad.
---
It's absolutely a bait-and-switch.
---
"We're giving you a bunch of free stuff.  Also, we're taking away the major source of free Atoms that let you buy whatever you want."
---
Because some players are jerks.
---
Moving the camp module in workshop mode. It's finicky you'll have to play around with it, and there's no guarantee it'll end up *exactly* where you want it to be, but 80% chance it'll be good enough.
---
There are several spawn points tied to your camp, and iirc where other players are placed is where you spawn at your camp on world load, as opposed to where you spawn when you fast travel. Could be wrong doe
---
Without doing ANY of the NW stuff, I‚Äôm at rank 18.
---
Level 33 here
---
I enjoy going through an area slowly and reading the notes/listening to holotapes. A lot, if not all of them, tie into main/side quest characters.
---
Time to go shopping lol.
---
Like I said earlier I'm a junkies PA heavy weapons build.  My standard loadout is as follows.
---
Gatling gun (it's only instigating but I would love a junkies explosive)
---
J2590 .50 cal (bread and butter baby)
---
AA Bashing 90 Gauss Minigun (still waiting on that good roll)
---
TSE LMG (mostly for fun but its actually quite effective at tagging swaths of land)
---
F 10ADS Flamer (good for bugs and other hard to target enemies)
---
V 90 Cryolator (good for holding down the queen)
---
TSE Gatling Plasma (absolute UNIT for ending anything except the queen)
---
V &lt;?&gt; Gatling Plasma (used for holding down the imposter sheepsquatch while I'm holding all the pylons)
---
I need a plasma caster but I want a good gauss mini before I start going for another.
---
apparently it looks like this

I'm with you. It would be nice to have some US military decor.
---
Personally I'd like to see some fatigues with camo patterns and maybe some vehicles like the Jeeps you see in game.
---
My 11 year old son would crush this
---
Or any enemy we have killed for that matter
---
I have played 1200 hours of FNV and only finished the main quest twice. I get sidetracked way too easily
---
Nice! I'm about 5 days ahead of schedule.
---
Shotgun is fine. Not the most popular at end game, but it will get you through levels just fine.
---
Run a tiny bit away from the event center, click on the event again the Map view, it‚Äôll load (quickly) and should register it for you. Seen lately on XB1.
---
In the end I upgraded my ram to 32gb and now it works. Not sure what that means...
---
i am pretty sure i could make you one. I'll check
---
i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs bethesda‚Äôs fault
---
You could also buy a few levels if you have enough Atoms
---
dont see the ini file?
---
I banked my base in the sky after people visiting would trigger nearby spawns, use the vending machine and leave without killing the big uglies that would then rampage through the lower levels of the camp. So far so good, not seen a single enemy make it to the rooftop area since I did this redesign. 
---
I lifted all breakables off the ground floor to the top.

grate floors up front allow 6 turrets to rain hell on anything wishing to walk up to the door

(do not ask how I got the blocks up there, I'm still baffled by it, after spending like 4 hours building/tearing down, I noticed it was letting me use them up there so made use of em while I could, I have no idea why it let me)
---
Adrenaline being borked is whats currently got me down.. 
---
I rarely if ever experience most of the bugs people talk about on PC.. only when something is outright broken like perk cards or sneak...
---
I don‚Äôt think any place is 100% AI enemy proof.
---
Its a matter of what type and level you dont want to deal with attacking.
---
IMHO, if you want to deal with only low level: molerats, liberators, scorched, roaches, mutants, wolves, ghouls, cultists, maybe a mireluck or two?  
---
Then camp any place west of Bolton Greens.
---
Bolton greens and points east, you are likely to get anything of any level.
---
  I‚Äôm on the forest side of the divide, just S of Monongah power plant.  Been there for over 150 levels.
---
My camp has been attacked by every creature in the game, up to 3\* L80, Except:  fog crawler, angler, ants, SBQ, snallys, deathclaw, Mireluck, radtoad, and stingwing. 
---
Theres a  spawn point 30 second walk S that rotates nothing there, legendary sheepsquatch, yogis, and the occasional mega sloth.
---
Yah, so is gun fu, but lately I‚Äôve been playing naked and with a crafted weapon...still killing most things very very quickly
---
True
---
Ah that sucks.
---
You'll soon be doing the silo's with your eyes closed though.
---
See if this works for ya, http://imgur.com/gallery/GkSh5nv

Good to hear that!üòÉüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
you can have other weapons? wat
---
Lol I believe so too. I mean it does say they are working so hard to fix it.
---
this was not a serious post
---
Spiked Lead Pipe is probably your best bet, but if you don't mind something electric the Cattleprod might be a good pick too. And stronger.
---
It's a Trade menu, not Barter! /s

That's one spikey boi

i can make one of each if you want. any level. Free
---
Nice! I'm only a day ahead of schedule.
---
sorry for the smart ass answer but if you got the money, you're never too late..
---
Talking of which, how many people have actually had emergency protocols and calibrated shocks plan drop from her? Ive done the queen hundreds of times and nope. Not once. Its driving me mad, since i spent a fortune on building strangler armor not realising it takes ultracite plans for mods!
---
You might not finish it, but you‚Äôll still get a ton of cool stuff.
---
That‚Äôs because shit grenades are, not surprisingly, not a very enticing reward.
---
Yeah most of my teams I played with trying to get the stimpack challenge done have only been worried about getting stim packs.
---
 I hope that was their intention forcing us all to play a mode we mostly all hate.
---
Yeah that works great üëç
---
No nuke here aswell. Attempted it when I was level 60 ish and failed and never tried again
---
That‚Äôs true, and funny, though I can‚Äôt see how much it is per tier? Is it 150 atoms a tier or 50?
---
It basically looks like a spiked mace. It's been one of my favorite melee weapons, cosmetically, since Fallout 4.
---
It should work pretty good for a trench club. Another thing to consider is that it is considered a pretty low tier weapon, so it should be pretty cheap to get.
---
Then what do you mean by "us"?
---
You just snitched on yourself. üòÇ
---
You‚Äôre ahead of me and I play a lot. But then again I don‚Äôt plan to finish it anyway. Nothing of interest reward wise for me.
---
There is always snow in ash heap, tho its black and make you sick.
---
I think they believe they are disrupting the game and economy right when all these new players are coming in on freebie accounts in order to stick it to mean ol bethesda..?
---
something like that.. 
---
whatever the case.. bethesda is all like.. meh, DGAF
---
They have huge reserves to scrip everyday)
---
On ru servers Fixer B2525 costs 20 k caps &amp; there is high competitive situationüòÇ
---
Im crying all day reading posts in Discord. 
---
Caps came back finallyüëçüèª
---
They get banned pretty quick now.
---
Yes.  Yes it does.
---
We do not talk about this feature
---
Take a look on eBay.
---
Enjoy :)
---
Glad I don't used power armor. I don't think they have dropped for me either but idk I could have read them already and accidentally sold copies for a single cap in my vendors lol
---
Thank you for clarifying that for me!
---
They are scared someone will use their work benches.
---
Also, theyblock everything just because they can.
---
Challange excepted! Todd Howard probably.
---
I use vault boy pointing thing so people know where to go
---
Selling on eBay for $100 or trading for rare outfits. I‚Äôd love one of the b2525 fixers, so it‚Äôs actually pretty disheartening to see them given away for the travelling leather coat and stuff.
---
The crystallizing barrel is one of the most broken things in this game. It doesn't add any damage, hit detection is awful, it breaks some legendary effects, and simply doesn't work with others. Broadsiders are also just awful, you can barely even get any damage done due to all the delays and potentially bugs around its projectiles
---
Closed doors?! Real idiots
---
Nah, this dupe wave isn‚Äôt the first and won‚Äôt be the last. Give it a few weeks and the economy will return to its usual inflated mess.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what happened here. Didn‚Äôt they take away the ability for your to be drawn into PvP with a team? Even if you shot back at the one guy, the other one wouldn‚Äôt be able to hurt you anymore.
---
Lifegiver perk under endurance along with the speed demon mutation.  Angry turtle has a vid on this discussing it but put simply that works. If you can ever find scorchbeast meat cranberry meat grinder helps too
---
Pretty sure its 90% the sweaty's that can one shot the SBQ with their bloodied fixer that seem to have negative shit to say about the game. Level 300+'s that have played for like 1200 hours but hate the game. If you've played the game for any considerable amount of time, I'm pretty sure you don't hate it. Props to Bethesda for sticking with it and improving it. I've only been playing since Feb this year but it's come a fair way even since then. I love the game, it does have flaws but any game does. My only real criticism is that most new features have some kind of grind or cap tied to it. But that's just more incentive to play for longer üëç
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/mXIKq36
---
Unless you really want the end tier rewards I'm not sure why you'd want to put the grind in at this point, just aim for the stuff you actually want. Personally I'm ever so slowly working towards that flying saucer for my camp, then I'm done lol
---
I am only missing the PVP achievements for the base game and only missing the Siding with the Raiders quest from the Wastelanders expansion. I have a high level alt, so I just have to do the quests again and side with the Raiders, but I haven't gotten to it yet.
---
Where is the option to spend atoms? I haven't noticed it
---
I now wish it worked the way you thought it did. That would have been cool.
---
Well I couldn't think of a better example. It was late. I was tired.
---
Well according to a lot of redditors college students with passion in gaming are better developers than people at Bethesda (check out comments about skyrim and fallout's modding community), reddit contradicts itself again.
---
You've scored with another player
---
ash.. heap
---
By definition, any deficit in a knowledge base is a loss. 
---
Especially when you seem to have unanswered questions or gaps in understandings. 
---
But, hey, ignorance is bliss!
---
Take care, bud!
---
Should be 150 a level unless they changed it.  So presumably, you could save the atoms earned and just level up 90-100.  Likely what some will do  Sucks though as you‚Äôll miss out on atom shop stuff.
---
150
---
bDisableSplash=1 doesn't let you open the news with T, while bSkipSplash does ... it just doesn't hit you in the face when you open the game, every time.
---
It‚Äôs cool, I‚Äôm just clowning.
---
They aren‚Äôt trading or selling in vending machines. They are trading and selling out of game on other sites for other rare items. 30k caps isn‚Äôt really that valuable once you hit end game since you can‚Äôt turn caps into anything valuable enough for end game players.
---
I cringed at buying FO1st for a month
---
Quick answer without watching a video:
---
they don't spawn. If you want to farm something oneworld, join with a mule account, join them and loot it with the main. Then let the mule connect to a different server, join and loot. Rinse and repeat till you have enough. Some items may not spawn always.
---
I stoped selling couse always someone was trying to bug the fucking vendor for the glitch to buy your things that wasn't liated, I always got to the camp and some a*;_-$ was crouched invisible almost inside my vendor and soon as they saw me they leave.
---
It‚Äôs not live yet. It‚Äôs set for the 7/14 update.
---
I ran into this thread trying to troubleshoot my own flickering problems, I have a RX Vega 64 as well.
---
Turns out if I disable Freesync on the monitor, the flickering goes away.  Hope this helps anyone who stumbles on this thread!
---
Another fix that worked for me 
---
Go to the directory that the game is installed on 
---
Z:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps\Fallout 76
---
Copy the Project76.ini file go to your my games folder on your windows drive
---
C:\Users\(username)\OneDrive\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76
---
Paste the file into this folder then right click on the file and change it to read only.
---
Yeah I gets it. Also slight smart ass remark back. üòÄ
---
In a game riddled with problems, this is for sure one of the most annoying.
---
Why is chameleon useless?
---
Ya i thought the market was broken last time but I still spend the same price for junk... idk
---
Maybe the bone club or baton
---
Lol I have everything unlocked... water purifiers, excavator, collection, ammo maker, and ammo converter.  Plus free plants to pick..my doors are always open. Lol
---
Same. Hope they change how season 2 works considerably.
---
This game is absolutely absurd:
---
* launched with a myriad of bugs &amp; issues plus no NPCs or really any actual RPG elements whatsoever
---
* basic QOL changes are either non-existent or locked behind a subscription fee that's higher than either PS+/XBL which give you online access for all games rather than just bonus items in one game as well as all television subscriptions like Netflix or Hulu (and even PS+/XBL are arguably a ripoff themselves given that PC games get free online So long as you have internet)
---
* the preorder bonus DLC for a unique item &amp; a few skins which would ordinarily cost sub $5 is goddamn *$20*. My jaw literally dropped when I saw how expensive the Tricentennial pack is.
---
* the Raider &amp; Settler DLC items are also each $20 unless you buy them together in which case it's still $30 for something that should all told be no more than 20 *at most* &amp; even that would seem overpriced for what it is
---
* there's a new DLC-exclusive item in the form of Piper's outfit which I don't believe you even get *with* their overpriced garbage subscription fee (correct me if I'm wrong, still dumb that it's not in the Atomic Store for anyone else though)
---
* There's about 15 different currencies or currency-esque systems to keep track of I  the game from caps to atoms to scrip to perk coins to claim tokens to bullion to ammo conversion rates to faction influence or whatever l
---
* etc.
---
And now they've removed one of the few ways you could consistently earn some atoms to at least get things from the shop.
---
That‚Äôs because everyone who played the game before Foundation became a thing all got nuked and then stopped playing the game.
---
...What‚Äôs foundation?...
---
Remember son, dying is gay
---
I‚Äôm willing to bet people are far more likely to have raised reputation with Crater than Foundation due to the glitch you could do to basically rank up entirely in one day.. As per the infographic they showed us a few weeks after Wastelanders, a significantly higher people sided with Foundation over Crater. No reputation glitch with the Foundation faction, as well as Crater having two dailies that (at least for me, for some reason.) glitch to get both in one day.
---
If you are on PC go into the game files and stop grass from rendering
---
Every day is the same day over and over again
---
And I hated that in RDR2. Almost made me quit. (In fact I did stop playing for over a year) lol
---
I got this glitch when I was lvl 2x or 3x don't recall they robed all my ballistic fiber and adeshive and I'm never over the Budget.
---
I sided with the Settlers, but still became ally with Raiders first. I got ally with Raiders 2 weeks ago and ally with Settlers on Tuesday.
---
Relax.. people will cheat in any game they can. Tic Tac Toe.
---
No one's missing the point. I just know that I don't like being spoken to like an asshole at work. You can ask every single question you asked without the attitude.
---
That's intended. Bethesda don't want you to spend money, and you should not do so.
---
*positive feedback entered* oh wait. just did that up there... ^
---
I think they wanted me to kill the lvl 20 so I get wanted and other guy collects bounty.
---
That is a guess, I have no idea how that works.
---
I have the ammo converter too...I wouldn‚Äôt mind some plants that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm missing my camp looks very masculine üòÜ
---
I take it seriously, man. This is all very serious. 
---
You think the apocalypse and scorched plague aren't serious??? This is not fake news, I promise you. Just yesterday my roof was caved in because a large SBQ took a dump flying over it. Sure it had some nice loot in it, but my roof!!!
---
You know that rank 25 is not 25%?
---
The score level increase each level, on lvl90 you'll need more then 3000 points.
---
Does it say it will be this way when released? No? Then stop whining about system that is clearly not finished. If then release it as is then you have you answer and can start whining again.
---
Again, this is clearly not finished and is not up to release for another 3 weeks.
---
Is there a particular build that works fine at a end game? Shotgun or otherwise. I just would really rather not use power armor if I can help it, whatever it may be
---
Nothing beats the bus at the WS apartments, the one with the grenades &gt;&lt;
---
Did any of these work? As I started a new character tonight and hit the exact same problem. Got out of the vault, listened to the holo tape, nothing, no body by the robot with Maria Chavez orders either. Went to flatwoods to log on computer, still nothing. I relogged multiple times. I even did a scan and repair option. I then deleted that character and started again, same thing. I don't want to do the wastelanders quest line yet.
---
Looks decent
---
Well your first paragraph is composed of a ton of wishful thinking. Firstly, never use the phrase "permanent fix" when it comes to code. Sooner or later, you'll just end up looking like an ass. Secondly, you never do 24/7 work for anything less than a system down issue. It's rough enough on business programmers, and game programmers work insane hours for a lot less than us. You're just asking for more crappy code breaking more stuff. And "for the weekend" is laughable. Everything I've seen indicates the rampant duplication issues are the result of fundamental flaws in the core design of their item management system. You don't fix that in two days. You don't fix that in two weeks. If you're lucky and they're already a chunk of the way through it, MAYBE two more months. And even then, releasing a revamp of a core system in an out-of-band patch (or worse, a hotfix) is crazy. The odds of wrecking something important go through the roof. If you take all of that out, you've basically just got a bunch of the same old. Report issues. We're working on it. We'll pass it to the team. Just more words, more flowery.
---
The second paragraph, well that's a lot of wishful thinking too, particularly assuming a fix is/can be ready in QA by now and that it will be sufficiently ready to go out by Monday. But hey, if you're going to have delusions, you might as well go for the really satisfying ones, right? 
---
Throwing out thanks to the community would certainly be nice, but good odds say folks just shrug it off as more words and PR speak. Fundamentally, they can throw out whatever words they want about top priorities and unintended problems, and people will just bludgeon them with it. Results are all that matters.
---
And the last bit is the usual give me compensation whenever something breaks that is rampant in every online game ever. They totally SHOULD do something to sort stuff out for the people who were screwed over by the SCORE issues. It's a cluster, and they obviously botched the first fix they tried for some of it. Folks shouldn't lose out for that. But you determine clean-up after a fix, not before.
---
Ultimately, if Bethesda wants to improve their image and relationship w/the community, they need to deliver more, not talk more.
---
I can find any information any kid says on any YouTube in written form. These people aren't prophets.
---
  I enjoy to read and look up information on my own rather than sit there and waste time watching somebody on a video tell me what I can look up myself.
---
If that's how you wanna spend your time that's fine. Not for me.
---
 I honestly don't understand why so many people get offended that I don't watch YouTube videos.
---
Two of those are working on the atom shop.
---
I got a good roll yesterday! An explosive anti armor 50 cal! I think this is probably the prime gun for my build. Very excited!
---
Personally would love icons for killed legendaries.
---
Indeed they should.
---
I will not squander scrip on bullshit rng thats never been in my favour anyway. Just weighs me down.
---
Oh nice. I'm lvl 17 but I have big plans for the future. I was hoping we would have some wooden baton, and I could make it nailed, or put a bunch of screws into the pipe but it just has a bunch of freaking bolts in it instead of nails, which would look so much better
---
Give light columns to dropped loot like Diablo 3. Done.
---
I got it in two matches because I pay attention to where the spawns typically are, and I went looking for them.
---
And I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre all crying themselves to sleep over your 27 karma post üôÑ
---
I might get the prod, how do I obtain it my friend?
---
I envision a camp that could both be beatiful and useful (vendors,extractors,water purifiers).Would you mind taking  a look around my original camp spot,and then maybe we can even think  about a new location?
---
I guess I havent been looking. Thanks.
---
Can‚Äôt remember where I read it, but didn‚Äôt Bethesda mention they were thinking of adding unique identifiers to weapons and armour to more easily identify and ban dupers? What happened to that idea?
---
skip doesn't do anything for me here, still right in my face.
---
This issue has been happening to me for months. Usually it takes several days for it to register for me to pick up the supply drop. I have given up on even requesting one since Wastelanders the computer won't accept my request.   
---
As well the Fort Venture computer won't accept requests for a cargo drop and the Command center now requires a password I used to have and no longer can find.
---
15 would be nice for my character now. And maybe a level 50 for later
---
Okay. Damn don‚Äôt need to get heated lol wish I had videos when I had modules. I was getting the perk activation noise and everything. I‚Äôll try it again when I‚Äôm home
---
well each world only holds 24 people i believe. So you wouldn't really notice.
---
What i do notice though is that there's sooooo many new people. So i imagine it is a lot more active now. I was starting to see familiar names now and then at events. Not now.
---
Probably Blue. I play a lot of paladins and I‚Äôm currently running a Rogue Inquisitive with the Faction Agent background. I might have a type! :)
---
&gt;Anybody with a passion in gaming are better developers than people at Bethesda.
---
FTFY, seeing as its being actively discussed on the subreddit that these developers don‚Äôt actually play their own game.
---
You have an employee dev who‚Äôs paid to make a feature/asset/animation/sound/etc. That dev might not pour their heart and soul into that feature/asset/animation/sound/etc. whereas you have people who put stuff up on the creation club and NexusMods and it‚Äôs super high quality because somebody took the extra time to refine their work to a level of detail that they were truly satisfied with and a level of quality your average Bethesda dev could only hope to achieve.
---
Yeah. Cause I was hoping they would add screws to the pipe, but it's just bolts screwed on instead ofscrew whitch would look even more badass for it
---
The game would need some kind of server text chat before any player hub would be feasible.
---
 Otherwise you have 18 players standing around giving emotes for God knows what reason while 2 people are singing to each other on microphones.
---
Nice, nice, I'll try the club, because I have a stun baton now
---
Privacy? Who knows what they're up to behind their fancy locked doors, I don't even have door frames...
---
Really though, I'm camped near the vault too, open purifiers, crops, work benches the lot and sometimes I'd like to lock myself away - particularly when I get people in my camp like the level two who visited this afternoon wearing nothing but their underwear and going at me with a combat knife like a kid at a pi√±ata party all whilst I'm just trying to make ammo.
---
Complete the Wastelanders questline, then buy it from Samuel in Foundation with the new currency you unlock. It's not expensive, doesn't have any other mods you'd have to buy, and it doesn't require a high reputation with the Settlers to purchase like other endgame items.
---
the moment it announces the bomb is dropping, run straight for the center where it shows the biohazard symbol. Then when you are on the symbol. look straight up and enjoy the view.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of fresh levels.
---
I got to the flying saucer a day ago - I'm trying for the bloody handmade skin @ level 68 .  The gatling skin would be ok also but I don't use 'em so whatever.
---
Same error. This makes it real hard to be excited about trying this game.
---
GT? i'll invite you
---
it accepted my request just fine. The circle is like... around Brim Quarry with all the Mole dudes. Its just a pain in the ass tbh. Ive been hoping it'll spawn if I wait, but its been half an hour
---
Perhaps you are thinking about the bone club?  Looks similar to a blackjack.  Of the Baton, which is more or less a big stick or shortened baseball bat
---
IIRC, for the bat, If you have the mods, the chained wrapped all Star has the highest DMG.
---
  As far as 1H goes, personally, I like serrated switchblades.  Light, fast, good damage (due to speed), and if you get a legendary, even better.  Been using one of those as my primary for somewhere around 160 levels.
---
At sub level 50, I was using a machete, death tambo, and cultist dagger.
---
Enemy spawns next to camps depend on two things:
---
First, the regular spawn which are always there. If you build your camp next to a regular enemy spawn, they will attack you. (Note: if your camp is right onto a spawn, this spawn might get blocked anyway.)
---
Second, the random attack event. Sometimes enemy's spawn next to your camp and attack it, mostly super mutants, liberator, molerats, mongrel and so on. The more defense you have (turrets, artillery, watchposts etc, everything in the building menu having a shield icon below) increase the chance that this hidden event will occur. 
---
If you want little to no enemy attacks, search a spot with no regular spawn nearby and don't place defense structures.
---
I hate that. Or when they have 4 scattered all over their camp. Plus organize them. Mine are easy to find and labeled.
---
Easiest way to get the PVP achievements I found if you don't enjoy it is to grab a friend who also doesn't have it and then take turns in killing each other until the trophies pop. Took me and a friend 10 minutes.
---
Great stuff. Ive said it before and I will say it again but the Slocom Joes is a great addition to the atomic shop. So much potential for camp building.
---
Lots of lower level players and hardly any player vendors. I used to hop btw 12+ vendors on a server. Now there's rarely more than 5-6. I resorted to hanging out at overseer camp and giving care packages to new players last night!
---
This just straight up isn't true. It gives you the extra rep if you tell the guy to go back to The Crater, that's how I do Retirement Plan everytime I get it. You don't have to kill anyone to complete the Raider dailies if you don't want to.
---
Oh sweet! Now does it have that weird coil thing on the end or is it just a straight stick, cause the stick version sounds cool but if it has the coil on it I'll use it
---
Yeah blue was always my favourite as well, meddling in affairs and intrigue. Was always partial to the green too.
---
Or you know, they could keep the corpses as corpses for longer.
---
I can‚Äôt count the number of times an enemy has died just to turn into a pile of meat/disappear within a few seconds.
---
I heard somewhere the 25% ffr doesnt work on gauss minigun, can u confirm or dent?
---
You'd think people would be too busy with seasons to spend time griefing, but then again I suspect these are the same folk who have glitched their way to rank 100 already anyway.
---
Dropping the spoiled bag was a nice move. I forgot to offer my griefer an Insult Bot note earlier, damn, a missed opportunity to stick a middle finger up in a polite way.
---
This worked for me!
---
Grim reapers sprint and gunfu is a great combo, just 2 points In gunfu is great if you want to spend points elsewhere.
---
It's a shame i don't have 2 sheepsquatch horns as i could have made you a club. They look badass AF 
---
https://i.redd.it/tew90z2it7p31.jpg
---
Fck score.
---
31 today
---
I hope you get to it without the grind starting to feel too much like hard work. Tbh I'm pretty glad I don't like this season's rewards that much, it asks for too much effort for the way I like to play
---
Mind giving me one of those care packages? üò≥üëâüèΩüëàüèΩ
---
I have
---
3 animated 1* E.M.T. cards,
---
3 non-animated 1* E.M.T. cards and
---
4 non-animated 1* Injector cards.
---
What exactly is the case scenario when duplicate cards disappear?
---
I get alot of health rubber banding when i use shottys
---
No, you can‚Äôt. You‚Äôre assuming that YouTube is just ‚Äòfor kids‚Äô. And that‚Äôs a very... limited and uninformed viewpoint.  There is a greater variety of content there (and in other similar outlets) than on traditional media. Yeah, there‚Äôs a lot of junk. But that‚Äôs true of all media. 
---
I don‚Äôt care what you chose to watch. I find it hilarious that you‚Äôre so dismissive of something you obviously know virtually nothing about. 
---
That‚Äôs why people are perplexed by you. 
---
And thinking that you‚Äôre closed-minded and uninformed isn‚Äôt the same as being offended.

Amused is more like it. 
---
Have a good day!
---
dont see the ini file? sorry im a noob when it comes to stuff like this
---
Seen a lot of lower levels with no icon or the current free icon so tells me they likely aren‚Äôt on another character. I‚Äôd been getting into games with people I‚Äôd played with like 2-3 months ago and it hasn‚Äôt happened again. I‚Äôd say the game has seen a fair amount of resurgence with wastelanders and free on GP
---
Ooooooo, nice! But what's blackjack?
---
They're coming out of the walls! They're coming out of the god damn walls!
---
I imagine what really gets the pot boiling is realizing they have lost 73% of their pc playerbase in three months in spite of two major patches and not individual players, but hey.
---
That does look badassas fuck!
---
Im rank 26 for reference
---
Under which condition do cards get lost/disappear?
---
Commissar#6088, I'll be on in a few hours so friend me and we can stay in contact. I have the xbox app so we can chat about stuff
---
I've been getting that or that the servers are down, and no matter how many times I've restarted the game or deleted and redownloaded it, it still says the same thing
---
Might just be called project76 if you cant see the .ini at the end
---
I see your point - PA should count.
---
I just killed a bunch of critters, looted them, repaired the looted weapons/armor, then scrapped or sold them.
---
It worked out - Learned a few mods, made a few caps, lost a little weight.
---
Someone did this to me when they were 45 and in power armor and I was like 26 or something but I decided to fight back and I absolutely destroyed them with the first ever .50 cal machine gun I had found a little earlier in the day. They kept coming back and dying it was pretty hilarious
---
Glad to help üòä
---
Hey but at least the Halloween and Christmas rewards are still live in NW!
---
The point is not that they deputize me as CM and use my words, the point is they communicate. Anything would do, but what they have done is not enough. They being internal, not the community managers who I know for a fact bust ass while having their hands tied behind their back.
---
&gt; Just more words, more flowery.
---
Intent matters, presentation matters, public confidence matters, and being responsive matters and anyone who has worked inside of a business where public relations matter (all of them, especially in enterprise IT where I work for example) will agree. What about the way Bethesda has responded to any one of dozens of controversies pre-launch, post launch, and every patch since makes you think their strategy is working? 
---
And seriously about compensation? These aren't simple QOL bugs, they are major and game breaking from beginning to end. I can think of a single time in two years where compensation was offered for their gaffs, and it was when the whole digital deluxe edition came out with a bag you could buy at the dollar store and even then it was 500 atoms. Compensation in this instance is not out of order considering I dutifully pay my membership and buy atoms to fill the gaps for new items I want up to very recently as this clusterfuck began reaching critical mass. 
---
&gt; The second paragraph, well that's a lot of wishful thinking too, particularly assuming a fix is/can be ready in QA by now and that it will be sufficiently ready to go out by Monday. But hey, if you're going to have delusions, you might as well go for the really satisfying ones, right?
---
I notice you not so cleverly left out the rest of the sentence to make an insult? I said monday/next week/next patch which by my clock gives them the weekend, a week, or potentially a month. Nice one. 
---
&gt; Ultimately, if Bethesda wants to improve their image and relationship w/the community, they need to deliver more, not talk more.
---
&gt; MAYBE two more months. 
---
You dont say, *looks at calendar after two years*. Wonder when that will happen.
---
Just move the camp around inside the build area and fast travel to your camp and that should show you were you'll spawn.
---
In FO3, you pressed a button on the controller to highlight containers. Possible in FO76 ?
---
well message me on here or there when you're on. It is 12.30am here now. I'll probably be around for another 3 hours. But if i don't reply then unfortunately sleep has claimed me.
---
Did you want the heavy or spiked?
---
World of Warcaft Simulator =))
---
The title specifically says Steam achievements and wastelanders was there from the moment the game was released on Steam. People who played before Foundation was a thing are literally not a part of the stats.
---
Giving out more care packages and having fun helping low levels complete some events. For a period, most low-levels I encountered were alt characters of players that really didn‚Äôt want or need help; I like seeing the folks that are just now jumping in :)
---
Many seem wary of a high level player tagging along, though. The new public teams seems to be helping with this - wasn‚Äôt expecting to like the new feature, but I‚Äôm digging it.
---
Calling me names because I don't enjoy to do something you do is very childlike. But Hey you be you.
---
I can find a million better things do with my time other than watch somebody else talk to me over a YouTube video.
---
 That's something you like to do that's fine. I prefer to read the information that I get.
---
You don't see me getting defensive over the fact that you'd rather watch somebody tell you something than read your own information.
---
your comment does not really address my reply but ok.
---
&gt; I remember reading that a lot of them had just come out of college and were just getting their feet wet in the industry. 
---
speaking of which, can you send me source for this?
---
Honestly I usually do the same, but this time I had a piece of PA to repair so I tried it. I just figure it's got armor in the name  so it should probably count haha
---
The same thing happened to me when we had this same goal a couple days ago. Someone came in to my camp and bought something, I got the points. Much thumbs upping for the person who did it.
---
I the same exact thing but it‚Äôs Mothman themed lmao
---
Nerd rage, serendipity, dodgy (if you wont need ap anyway), Barbarian.
---
Nerd rage is must have, serendipity is highly recommended) and the other two I mentioned are optional.
---
Also, if you play with mutations (starched Genes and classfreak) get scaly skin.
---
Heavy for the 15. And spiked for the 50 one. And I'll be on in like an hour and 20. Got some chores to do first and shower cause it's been a long day
---
This worked for me! Thank you kind stranger!
---
It's got the coil on the end.
---
Some people like to lock their bedroom for instance just to have a secure location to complete trades and exchange items without fear of someone running in and grabbing the stuff off the floor. Sometimes you have the trade bug and it won‚Äôt let you complete a trade so it‚Äôs easier to just drop items on the floor rather than traveling to an event and back to clear the bug. I know it may seem dumb but I usually always have a locked room for that purpose with no windows just so I can trade/swap in peace.
---
Holy shit this worked. Not the same path for me. Mine wasn‚Äôt in one drive. But found the folder and it worked.
---
got it to work. ty
---
Here‚Äôs a Dev comment on this topic FROM OVER A YEAR AGO... https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1t7ex/xpost_from_rfallout_im_legally_blind_and_i_love/eatn4dt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
I‚Äôm legally blind and posted this question with many suggested solutions when 76 first released. Lots of players with 20/20 can‚Äôt find legandaries, imagine having worse than 20/400... I was very excited when a Dev commented and seemed interested in adding some sort of solution... now this suggested has been posted dozens of times on this sub and no Dev has ever commented on It again. I‚Äôm not the most optimistic person (being blind will do that) but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a safe bet they‚Äôre not concerned with this problem. Can you sense my immense disappointment?
---
I never heard of that being mentioned. It would add MASSIVE strain on servers though, given that‚Äôs very similar to why there‚Äôs a stash cap. I don‚Äôt see it happening.
---
I always keep my vending machines on the first floor of my base, inside away from the elements. I also have a farm in case you need to make adhesive
---
It's supposed to come live 2 weeks after the starting date of the season.
---
A trade menu with no option to trade.. only sell
---
Go into your pip boy and click on the event in the data tab.   Sometimes when you join the event it didn't automatically activate it.
---
It was a reference to Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics barter skill and barter system =)
---
I get this message every time I try to play
---
I didn‚Äôt call you any names. I used adjectives to describe the perception others seem to have about you.
---
I don‚Äôt limit myself to a particular form of information delivery. 
---
And a lot of what you ‚Äòread‚Äô about this game (especially in reference to tips or guides) originated from content creators on YouTube. And then sometimes their content gets transcribed by others. 
---
But you wouldn‚Äôt know that. You make the assumption that whatever written form you read is posted by the original content creator. 
---
Saying that it‚Äôs ‚Äòbetter to read the information instead of watching it‚Äô is like saying it‚Äôs better to read the newspaper than see the events firsthand. 
---
I‚Äôd rather watch a football game than just read the score in the paper later on. 
---
So, no, I never called you any names. I just pointed out the faulty logic in your position.
---
Clearly, someone pointing out your odd learning choices bothers you. 
---
Again, do whatever you want. I just find it highly amusing that you base your position about a media platform through the lens of prejudice and ignorance.
---
If you're on PC you can modify your ini file to not spawn in grass. AngryTurtle goes over [modifying your ini file](https://youtu.be/byE4qyx8kwA).
---
I generally have decent numbers of players on servers although occasionally it does get a little thin. Atm it's very lively, maybe not full but no mass drop off that often happens late night
---
Currently in a builder team with 3 noobs I've not even seen yet. It does seem however everyone is happy with the xp boosts as I see they've put on at least 5 levels each since I joined.
---
Same here, I have to use 2-3 stimpaks just to get through the front gate at west-tek now. My stockpile is dwindling down fast. And I'm repairing armor alot more
---
Does the helmet alone do the stealth field?
---
Just here to downvote this clickbaiting title with a boring wall of text. Shame on you.
---
A thousand times this
---
In the end, yes. You can only do the Vault raid with one of them and at the end of it you have the option to give them varying amounts of the gold. This will cause your reputation to raise or lower depending on the option. However, at the end of it all, you can do daily missions for both factions to gradually raise your reputation with them. I highly recommend doing the quests for both factions before choosing who to do the raid with.
---
Hope this answer was helpful.
---
I thought about using tents to make a civil war style camp.
---
Or your gun
---
By switching do you mean you reinstalled the game? Reinstalling clears the in game photo gallery on console. The photos should still be in your console‚Äôs screenshot folder, though. However, the game won‚Äôt see them and you can‚Äôt add them back into the photo gallery.
---
why not both? food and chems stack
---
edit: you can also stack multiple food types, you can stack Cranberry Relish &amp; Brain Fungus soup because the effects are different
---
Be gentle, meanwhile I'm at close to 200 hours and still live in a shitbox with wallpaper.
---
Notice how none of the community managers you tagged have given enough of a fuck to even respond.
---
I hate when I kill something with the intent of eating it as a cannibal, turn my back and in that amount of time it becomes a non edible meat pile. Wtf?
---
Ahh, Thankyou. They should leave it even longer so people can't smash through it. I just want the option near the end. Hopefully it's not exorbitant
---
I mean, 76 is jist a really big and expensive freemium product. It's a suped up Farmville/Clash of Clans. The skimmer box has one goal in life: partying you with your money.
---
I wish there were real seasons, but we are supposedly locked in the same three-day cycle. Realistically, massive nuclear detonations across the world would have produced a harsh couple years of winter-like conditions in the region, followed by a long-term warming trend that would push the latitudes that experience snow quite a bit farther north. It is not really part of lore or anything, but for the size of non-crustacean arthropods to be reached that we see, the oxygen levels and global temperatures would be much higher, indicating a climate shift where Seattle/Ireland temperatures being the norm in northern Greenland and Antarctica.
---
It depends.  The map actually spawns in additional creatures when certain circles contract, so your chances of finding some might actually increase in certain situations.  There are some general areas where you can sometimes find creatures in greater concentrations at round start (Vault Tec Ag Center on Flatwoods Map and Morgantown highschool on Morgantown Map are a couple stand outs)
---
same issue here
---
Since Wastelanders went live.  
---
I've bumped into some in Foundation, but in general they're pretty much wherever Settlers might show up.
---
Just make the enemies have a different look
---
that's what ive been doin, taking my time
---
Ha ha yes there is that
---
Or save your atoms you earned earlier and buy those levels. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning
---
I mean. Im level 25 now and havent even really started the main quest. Im taking my time, exploring, doing a few quests here and there. I like to find new plans and build my base, mod and upgrade weapons, fight a few bosses with my friends.
---
It‚Äôs 150 Atoms per rank. It makes the most sense to play through as long as possible, and then only buy ranks at the end, when the SCORE needed to rank up is much higher, like in the 3000+.
---
As long as there have been human NPCs there have been ghoul NPCs. There are raider ghouls as well
---
 No... what bothered me was that it bothered you enough to point it out.  Giving me a lecture saying that I am uninformed and close minded, both are derogatory names by the way.
---
 All because I have absolutely no interest in watching a YouTube video.
---
 I'm fine not watching videos. I'm fine if you do like watching videos. 
---
See the problem with the world today is everybody wants everybody else to think just like them, including you.
---
Just use them weapons. Hit a few enemies or get hit a few times and repair them.
---
Even worse is that the bodies don't wind up in the same place for everyone. The flies help, though. Maybe different colored flies for a legendary??
---
Screw it, just let me have Dogmeat. He brings me all the good stuff, such a good boy.
---
Yup.
---
Craft/aquire low level armour, then either shoot at your feet with an explosive weapon or just stand and let stuff attack you while you use stimpaks
---
Or a few low level weapons and bash a bunch of enemies with them
---
It can be pretty quick that way :)
---
Yeah I get it. It's the same as any other game really. I am happy to hear that the price doesn't increase per rank though. Cheers
---
Only raiders and setters have that reputation system currently. Yes you can be allies with both. The other factions work differently (free states, responders, enclave, BOS, pioneer scouts)
---
Need to be lvl 50 and decent gear to get the event reward, where alot of people who are new to the game now are unable to reach it that quick. Also, you need to know how you get them in the first place, not everyone who starts the game already know everything. 
---
Bethesda did another money grab here, I don't wanna know how many repair kits got sold today... clever doing this just a few days after game pass added fo76.
---
To be perfectly frank, I'm not terrifically interested in the notion of providing sympathy to any group of individuals who freely and openly admit to the unnumbered murderous outrages which the Crater raiders have committed (and will continue to commit) upon hapless and defenseless victims. Additionally, the Crater raiders treat viciously any member who would wish to divest himself of this lifestyle, and I'm of little mind to consider the greater depths of their humanity once a raider crosses that line which distinguishes an individual as a threat to my community.
---
The raider thief had it comin', don't feel pity for a person who knew the risks of his endeavors.
---
Been playing Fallout games since 1998, F76 is, well, different, but I absolutely love that I can play with my brother and that game is Fallout game, it is first game that we ended up playing together
---
No way to really tell about the population since only 24 people on any given server. It is noticeable the amount of low level players though. So that‚Äôs cool.
---
Better armor?
---
pearly gates peepers, then
---
I just noticed if I alt tab to a second monitor, it looks smooth as if its max'ing FPS. but actually focusing the window its running in causes stutter
---
I don‚Äôt care what you think or how you think. 
---
I simply find ignorance and prejudice amusing. 
---
People asserting uninformed opinions is hilarious. 
---
Had you ever actually had relevant experience that you used to form this opinion, that would be different. 
---
But this is like a child saying they don‚Äôt like a particular food before they‚Äôve even tasted it. 
---
It‚Äôs cute.
---
Unless you just don‚Äôt watch any video of anything at all. Maybe it‚Äôs a spiritual or religious thing.
---
brilliant
---
Dunno, I think it's fine
---
So, if I don't get all the crap, I don't get all the crap. Oh, well.
---
Knew it. I knew it as soon as Bethesda announced that PvP will only happen between the people hitting each other that this would be a tactic.
---
new players: och no , what we gonna do , dupping destroyed the market atm   
---
bethesda during 2 years of dupping : \*rope around neck\* first time?
---
Three things that kill you quick when bloodied are radiation, poison, and explosions. If you find unyielding armour with poison or rad resistance, grab it. I also run the fireproof perk and mod my chest with the dense mod, never take explosive damage and the queens sonic attacks do nothing.
---
Oh.. I started playing when 3 came out üòÑ
---
I have the same bug !! Its not showing at the atomic shop ! Looks like i missed the emote forever !!
---
Tasty squirrel stew is like 10% exp bonus. Not sure if carnivore will double it or not.
---
Cranberry relish is the vegetable version also at 10% exp bonus.
---
Yes, they did. The team was expecting OP to shoot back at the level 20. But with the guy cloaked in front of him, they were actually aiming for OP to hit the cloaked guy instead, to where he could shoot OP back.
---
Or random organic legendaries exploding thinking they're a robot!
---
You got it, keep killing sbs.  You could possibly also find it on a player vendor.
---
This is sad to hear, but somehow understandable. What If they add something in the atom store you want? With this attitude there is no way you can earn atoms at all if you done the lifetime already. One way or another, people are forced to spend money if they want to proceed like they are used to. Atom items are only available for cash this way.
---
Oh crap!
---
A few days ago I came across a literal maze house and while it was fun and unique, it was a bit frustrating since I was just camp hopping to check vendors and that one camp took a good couple minutes to get to the vendors. I could definitely see that turning off potential customers as well
---
This doesn't prevent me from spending money,
---
It's either a 10 or a 20 =0
---
made both and a 50
---
I run two different armor sets. One set; Three powered sentinel assassin pieces, one chameleon powered sentinel and an autostim powered sentinel piece. Set two; three mutants powered sentinel pieces, one chameleon powered sentinel and an autostim powered sentinel piece. For me, it has been working.
---
That's the spirit.
---
Throw more cash up the dragons throat, even if you don't get anything for it.
---
I'll do 20, I'm close to leveling up again so might as well get some perks in for extra stuff while I'm at it
---
I have a single locked door. My camp is a raider/mercenary themed one, and that locked door is just iron bars for a 1x1 jail cell. That I leave open. You won‚Äôt find out until you jokingly lock yourself inside.
---
You should do all quests for both factions right up until you get the quest ‚Äúside with crater‚Äù or side with foundation‚Äù that way you get to do all the available quests up until that point. If you choose too early and side with one you automatically fail any of the incomplete quests for the side you don‚Äôt pick
---
I just went with the raiders because foundation seemed boring tbh.
---
Ahh I can see how this could be a likely scenario. Weird though.
---
I have a J/25/15 gauss minigun firing  it isn‚Äôt worth the grind it takes to get the ammo
---
it's a feature not a bug
---
If I watched YouTube videos I probably would have never played fallout 76. Every video that I even attempted to watch said nothing but negative shit about the game.
---
 Then all the sheep on reddit followed suit because their favorite YouTube person said the game was shit.
---
 I have never disliked the game even since launch therefore the only opinion I've ever cared about was my own. I don't need a YouTube personality giving me my opinions.
---
  You can literally watch the sheep follow without any original opinion of their own and it's quite amusing to watch.
---
 So yeah I have treaded in the waters of YouTube. It's definitely not for me. It's too bad you can accept that.
---
Scorchbeast brain +8 intelligence.
---
The vender steal glitch is still intact, so we can't always have them right at the entrance alas.
---
