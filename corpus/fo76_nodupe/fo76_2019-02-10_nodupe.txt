If they don't understand the effort it takes to get a character to that damage output level then it's pointless to argue. Let them complain.
---
---
---
My argument is that choosing to stick with an always on weight reduction card has the potential to provide more effective stash than a trivial static increase.
---
I’ve been really curious to see the other masks (I hate the one everyone finds in Fort Defiance, lol) and I looovee a lot of the other ones you show. Really hope they add a way to get those and I think an event would be a really cool way to do it!!  Thanks for sharing!
---
Only if you're melee 
---
yes, super annoying. 
---
Mines just an Enclave Mutant experiment who uses Sneak and Unarmed. He has Healing Factor, Scaly Skin, Talons, Twisted Muscles, Chameleon, Electrically Charged (caused by the chameleon energy field he creates when hit), Speed Demon, Marsupial, and Bird Bones (with adamantium skeleton perk; light but very strong) with the two mutation perks. Too bad there's no physical changes to them you can toggle on and the best Unarmed I've found is a Power Fist. I need a Meat Hook or Deathclaw Gauntlet to fit theme more. 😯
---
\&gt;  And yet if you're a part of the team you have to complete quest objectives separately 
---

---
Yea it helps address leeches who don't want to do any work but gain all the benifits.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\&gt;  don't get XP from enemies your team kills. 
---
But you do if you are within range just like you get a chunk of exp and caps when they complete quests. 
---
\&gt;  The faction system is barely existent and not player focused at all. 
---
So why do you need a faction system to be an MMO? Runescape with the 6th age story line you can support various gods but the faction system is meaningless outside of very specific events. And even then in quest lines you would at best change the dialogue a bit depending on who you are talking to and your self chosen alliance.  Destiny the different characters are basically factions but the only effect they have is your move set.  Factions are not what makes an MMO and MMO.  
---
\&gt;  There's no player hub anywhere to speak of on the map. 
---
Shops are player hubs as are major towns.    
---
  
---
\&gt;  PvP is a shoehorned mess and the only "raid" event is the final boss.  
---
That describes a lot of games honestly. And raids are only one kind of activities.  
---
\&gt;  Player bases can't even be combined. 
---
Yea they can as long as you are on a team with them you can build in their area. The only thing is once you log off your sections disappear.   
---
\&gt;  ut please tell me more about how this game "has all the hallmarks of an mmo" you fucking muppet. 
---
* Online game (obviously)
---
* Major emphasis on team based game play rather then individual
---
* Requires you to work to get items rather then just having them handed to you.
---
* Requires you to work to maintain those items rather then make them infinite use
---
* Events in game that are designed to allow players to group up to help each other complete them faster to earn rewards.
---
* Resource nods that players can fight over to gather resources needed to help get going.
---
* Focus on player based economy with the intent to have players trade each other for caps, weapons and mods.
---
* Cooperative quests that you can assist players on even if you have already completed. 
---
* Free updates adding new content, new events, new mobs to the game to allow it to expand
---
" We have our own place we hit, and anecdotally has a much higher 2 &amp; 3 Diamond drop rate off those 2 &amp; 3 star mobs then whitespring"
---
orly? care to share?
---
Yeah it definitely seemed huge. I was intrigued originally as well because I used to live in West Virgina and wanted to see how many references to actual places I could find. 
---
Then I got trapped in Clarksburg in a burned out building with a supermutant tweaked out on chems chewing on me. 
---
And it was enough to have that happen once in real life so I had to uninstall. 
---
Yeah, I keep about 10k 5mm rounds (other types as well) on hand and always equip bandoleer, but I have a melee build
---
loooooool 
---
That's the point, it's either on the top of r/all or...you're still subbed to a game you can't believe people are still playing. 
---
Like I said, you're still subbed so you can post random salty comments. Yet everyone still playing is stupid and too mad to think when clearly the game hurt you. 
---
I hope your life gets better champ. 
---
just assume everything you get is a suppresser's rolling pin, 1 star
---
That sounds rather interesting. Your punch is gonna be good.
---
It's less than a year worth of time, it's reasonable to suspect that the server itself will reach this amount of up time about a year after it's official launch... Maybe the dev contracts are for 7600 hours of server time before they renew their contract (could make sense seeing that they want to keep the game running forever but it's unreasonable to be throwing out 3 year contracts to every dev when they might end up needing their focus and talent put towards another game if fallout doesn't work out after a year)
---
Hmmmm sounds good

See for yourself :P They uploaded in the exact opposite order than I wanted them to though so the assholes terminal is at the bottom and a bit of a spoiler for what's in 94 is right at the top.
---
Yes, please.  This has been plaguing my OCD.
---
Is that game on Xbox PC and Ps4 
---
any PC game can be updated stupid fast but I know for a fact updates need to be sent through to Microsoft for xbox to be approved so it doesn't mess with the hardware 
---
Though I understand your point but an indie dev probably knows more about their own engine (like they built it) than the Austin Beth group does about the ancient one they were handed 
---
Oh yeah difficulty isnt an issue. I specifically try and find difficult games as I enjoy a challenge. 
---
Honestly I think survival mode in FO4 is harder than 76. So long as you don't count the various death causing techincal issues. 
---
Please tell me where else you nuke besides WS. I need legendaries and a new place to grind. Thank you! &lt;3
---
I got it from a workshop defense. If you’re on Xbox I can build you some.
---
I had a similar bug with my pump shotgun and gatling gun. I'd have 497 rounds in the tube. I was unstoppable. Then I needed plastic
---
I have found one plan for a serum as a loot drop. Scaly skin. I assume it was from a SBQ, but honestly I don't recall getting it. I just know I did not purchase it.  On a side note, It's too bad vendors don't have enough caps to buy serums. 
---
Im on xbox, gamertag is my reddit name.
---
I posted this same shit and got downvoted...
---
Find you a girl that looks at you like Mothman looks at lamps.
---
Basically the finding is backhanded. And the:
---
&gt;the fuck is over-sensitive?
---
Those parts. 
---
LUCKY!  I've been playing since Reclamation day and have yet to see either mothman or the flatwoods monster.  
---
Even the dang event that is supposed to spawn mothman never pops when I am on.
---
I'd say you've lived up to yours, but most people I know that went to school can think critically. 
---
Hope your day gets better champ.

Never heard of anything like that
---
Player Species change mod. Choose Protectron, Assultron, Sentry Bot, Scorched, Ghoul (feral and normal) Super Mutant, and anything else that could be fun.
---
Also Legendary power armor
---
Feel better now? 
---
I would probably drop it to be safe during the banwave of 2019. It's pretty clearly not intended
---
And how about allowing us to remove stairs regardless of wether or not it leaves an area inaccessible... that would be a really nice basic feature... I have no idea why the developers give a shit if I want to make an area of my house inaccessible...
---
Also.. add actual fucking ceilings so I don’t have to add an upper floor piece with stairs I can’t remove just so I can have an actual ceiling to attach my ceiling fan, run power conduit on, or hang light fixtures.
---
System?

Oop xbox

I've seen people selling things like this on the market, not a behemoth but a snallygaster acid attack.

Main Character: 137

Alt: 63.

Need more PvE content now...

Only quest I have left is Overseer's Mission because it refuses to finish after doing everything.

I had a Giddyup Buttercup that glitched in my inventory.  I couldn't scrap it, but if I went to Junk View, it said it was worth something like 45 million+ of each of it's components.  (45455923) some randomly large number.
---
Couldn't actually scrap it, and once I changed servers (logged out) it disappeared.
---
All i'll say is bomb places that have large interiors. Buildings you have to enter.  The higher the base level the better.
---
Killed an epic behemoth at whitespring today
---
Do not forget Scaley Skin, adds +50 for ballistic and energy resist, but lowers AP a bit. if you plan on using an unarmed melee weapon also get Talons.
---
Launching time meow 
---
I have a melee/shotgun alt that I've been playing almost exclusively since the crit and stealth nerfs. I'm having a blast and using my shotgun like 1% of the time.

honoring the dead ain't pointless, my friend

I've noticed this I kept checking the floor where I had just walked thinking it was a trap like them spikes but there is never anything there. I also have adrenaline reaction

I do something similar with Ordinance Express on my explosives character. 
---
I'm sure as hell not going to deposit my 50 mini-nukes into my stash even though I hardly use them because they weigh 0.6 on my person rather than 6 lbs each in my stash.
---
We are already making these choices.
---
Aka run around being a dick until someone is dumb enough to fight back. 
---
Like I said, show me where in the code, you have a claim, you need to support that or it remains just that, a claim. 
---
It had the steal shit while trading thing that turned out to be false as well as numerous bugs that could never be repeated or were documented that were all voted to the top of this sub.
---
Nothings worse than a 3 star not dropping a legendary. That makes me want to rage quit.
---
Yes, craft radaway with glowing fungus. The radaway recipe can be bought at the whitespring bunker medical bay. I have crafted radaway but realized that radway drops often enough in mobs as rewards so crafting radaway is not important.
---
Aren't you dead?
---
People don't show on the map if they crouch. It's possible they also had chamaeleon armour and / or mutation which would suit the long distance sniper sneak build.
---
Im with you on the tse when youre that high level you should be op, and i dont feel like redoing my character specs so i play about 3 hours a week now
---
Be very wary of statuses expiring when you play low health. Accidentally eating too much, for example, can kill you (well fed adds max HP and, when it expires, removes it....). Changing +END gear will also probably kill you.
---
No I’m on PC. Thanks though!
---
Just drop a nuke on any place with a large building that has a entrance that separates it from the main world. Try charleston capitol and let us know. 😎
---
It's so much fun running around with this axe. I can't run power armor because of my armor but I don't mind dying a little bit more then I used to since I can still run through enemy's

I'd wait until survival mode, I am

For the love of Atom.

Lately servers are only trash after a sbq event
---
Similar issue happened to me after the patch, except I never got to the Please Stand By screen (almost loaded, then nothing). Like you I don't use mods.
---
Are you a widescreen user? Widescreen support broke for a lot of us. I solved the problem by deleting Fallout76Prefs.ini. Took a lot of hours and reinstalls and thinking through stuff to figure that out. 
---
The Feed the People event originally gave every person in the server cans of soup upon the completion of the event. Bethesda accidentally thought it was a bug and removed that feature so that was that.
---
What's wrong with a giant one following you around like a pet?
---
I don't see the problem then. 
---
The play stlye that you are choosing requires a bit of planning and maintenance. If you do not like it then you can play a different way.
---
The most recent time was Awesome Opossum Bacon and the time before that was either Radaway or Radaway Diluted.
---
I didn't have mutations, and I don't think I had Radworms.
---
 A lot of the times I was in power armor but I don't remember if it was every time.
---
jeeesus what is this wall of text. Get a life.
---
Stop with the click bait 
---
I was out questing one afternoon just minding my business. Got a message my base was being attacked. Check the map and sure enough there is a wanted player there. I'm just up the road for Slocum's Joe in The Forrest, so I fast traveled there instead of directly to my base. Stealthed my way to base and there is someone wandering around. Like level 12 maybe. Ok, let's see how this plays out. 
---
I fired up my mic and made the kid just about shit himself. Between him being map blind because of wanted, and my chameleon armor, he had no idea I was there. Some squeaker about 8 or 10 I guess. Come to find out, he tried to close the door and hit the wrong button and "attacked" it instead. I kill him to clear the bounty, give him his 5 caps back and help him out with some gear. 
---
I thought that would be the end of it. But every once in a while, I'll be puttering around C.A.M.P. and he'll stop by and say Hi. He's a decent enough kid. 
---
I'm glad I didn't jump to conclusions and assume the worst. 
---
Paws! I'm not ready!
---
Wow and everyone is dead.  Imagine that.  
---
I’m glad they got rid of that game breaking bug. Getting stuck in power armor, no damage bugs, endless server disconnects- that all I can deal with. But getting 2 free cans of soup every now and then?? That’s where I draw the line
---
Guess i will have to find a random 
---
You're too kind, thank you. To add some context as to why: the word 'fascist' is written 'Faschist' in German, so 'faschnacht' might evoke some subcontext that's really out of place here. Young people (especially leftists, or punks) will often refer to neo-nazis as 'faschos', and so on.
---
But I'm over-dramatizing again, don't get me wrong, I'm actually rather cool with it, it is just a really, really odd choice of spelling.
---
Level 180, 150 hours, XB1, not playing until new content is dropped or when I have more stash space for collecting. 
---
Don't get a mutation with out starched genes to keep them and class freak reduce negatives and I recommend healing factor too, you save so many stims and barely any negative with class freak.
---
A bit off topic but can anyone show me/explain how to get the garage door functioning with a single power switch? I attached the garage door to a generator and the switch and I've also attached the switch to the generator, but no luck :( All YouTube videos show a completely different scenario with connectors I don't own
---
[removed]
---
Agree. A shotgun camo skin has already been datamined. But we need more,for more weapons,and not just camo!
---
Smart man, but what is survival mode it's all the time PvP right?
---
PC? 
---
50 mini nukes sounds like a good time! A blast! Yukyuk
---
 What system are you on? 
---
Personally, Pacifist mode should change your name to a bright baby/sky blue to indicate Pacifist mode. it should block you from taking or doing slap damage to other players. your camp is immune to player damage but you cannot deal any damage to any workshop items, even if it is in a workshop owned by someone else
---
also i think Bounties should start at 5% of your cap supply and scale up to 50% depending on how horrible you are, would give more bounty hunters a reason to go after a criminal instead of a measly 10 caps
---
Please, show us poor, clueless no-nothings a gloriously, glorious sample of the coding you would write to fix everything and and uplift Fallout76 to the echelons of MMO gaming glory!!!! 
---
Unless of course, "gasp", you **don't** actually know what you're talking about?
---
No, I choose to *believe*! Please enlighten us grand game-development guru!!! Shower us with your dev cycle wisdoooooom!!!!
---
Fuck. Sorry, no. I just edited my post.
---
was also checking my map the other night and was in a world with only 2 other people. first time ive noticed a server being so empty.
---
Just don’t expect anything. Same advice goes for the whole game really.
---
Ah, dang. Good luck! 
---
Thank you though. Damn
---
Does enforcer/shotgun work to bring them down?
---
Yeah but with how much people have been telling Bethesda not to let people carry their OP characters and weapons over I'm almost certain they will force us to make new characters
---
Try going to the lighthouse when it isn’t active. Events seem to start when a player goes within a certain vicinity of the location. If you’ve already tried this I don’t know if anything else.
---
Good question want to know that one myself
---
So in short, you’re suggesting that if they did play but their experience made them stop playing, their opinion no longer matters?
---
Downvotes huh? I guess some people don't like evidence.
---
you been living under a rock?  or do you just not know that anyone can use a program to read video game files?  either way [here](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76s-lunch-boxes-sure-sound-like-the-loot-boxes-it-was-never-going-to-have/) is an article on the lunchbox thing...
---
as to the other things, now you show me proof that there was never a case where someone stole shit while trading.  as to bugs that *you* couldn't replicate, that doesn't mean they don't exist, and until Bethesda implement the "Known Issues" list they promised Jan 31 there is no way for you to know what bugs do and don't exist.  now it is you that has a claim that needs to be supported...
---
Yeah that would be a good thing hopefully that happens soon
---
I ran into the flatwoods monster once. He can apparently boost mobs because suddenly there was a floating alien, a Scorchbeast, and a bunch of scorched all covered in this weird purple fog. Not at all what I expected after jumping off a cliff into the Mire.
---
If you get the rotating arrows, just wait it out. I've found it takes a long time proportionate to the number of players. If it's *empty* with no loading circle, you're screwed.
---
But tbh it just makes me want to use Power armor instead 
---
Look at it from the point of view of difficulty and experience. Assume any loot is a bonus and you might be pleasantly surprised.
---
I'd imagibe with the game this broken on release and 3 months after, easter eggs were the least of their priorities and probably aren't finnished. I do love the mysteries however and I hope they are true and fully fleshed out in game.
---
But no one joins hunter/hunted.
---
Kinda sounds to me that you are suggesting the people who dont play anymore, many of which dont play due to being just plain ol fed up with the constant BS, shouldnt have a say at all.
---
Im in that boat. I want the game to do well and change for the better, but Hot damn it is hard to stay fully constructive when saying what my issues are now.
---
Xbox?
---
Yes!
---
I tried but no luck.  I'm not sure what triggers it. 
---
Hm, I'd have to look into it, I'm sure the Devs talked about doing it late 2019 at some point, but yeah 
---
Xbox
---
Still not seen one of these since th beta lol
---
Yeah if they let us carry them over I'm still going to make a new character just not for survival the PvP dosn't really interest me too much especially if I'm a level 10 with a pipe pistol facing off with a level 200 with his 3*  explosive weapons and full set of assassin's armor.
---
Lucky! The only time I encountered it, it immediately tried to probe my buttocks. I unfortunately had to lay some lead, cause it didn't even send me a heart emote first, or offer to take me out for some waffles. I'm just not that kind of guy.
---
then you havent used one since the update. they're weak now. sad
---
Yeah I think even in VATs even if it's out of damage range it can still cripple the wings.
---
I’m straight up gonna tell you I downvoted you for using “introverts” as an insult. You sir, are an asshole.
---
Ah...sorry man. I'm a Sony kind of person.
---
Inspiring people to complain nonstop...
---
I can hop on and help if you want. I’m level 76 but can use my lower level character if you like, which is level 5.
---
happens on PC too if you're a controller-pleb like i am lmao
---
I’m lvl 70, still never seen the moth man in game. Where do I find him?
---
If you still haven't been turned off by all the negative hype surrounding this game, then go for it! Many of the complaints are completely unfounded and they've been fixing the legitimate problems at a decent rate. 
---
For example, the community complained about stash size, they upped stash size. Community complained about duping, they fixed duping. Community complained about two shot/explosive legendaries being overpowered, they reduced the damage. Community complained about scorch beasts spamming their sonic attack, they're reducing the sonic attack frequency. Stuff like that. They legitimately seem to be listening.
---
A lot of the other complaints are entirely subjective. Some of the balance changes they've made ended up nerfing a few very specific play styles, suddenly there's a hundred people that supposedly only use that play style that come out of the woodwork to complain. Some people bought the game knowing that there were no human NPCs, just real human players, and complain about it anyway. There's constantly people complaining about the PvP mechanics, but those same PvP mechanics are one of the main reasons I bought the game.
---
Up to you, but for me it's definitely worth the $35.19 I paid for it.
---
we NEED action bar responsiveness / customization, perk card UI /process streamlining (I mean not having duplicating anymore and being able to store cards we aren't going to swap in - IMO there should not be a switch everything including equipped but sets of cards to store and recall from stored at once could work great in this system for players to maintain differing groups of perks that belong together), containers, team co op system that has leveling and building and perks, the objects we wanna display are CONTAINERS to organize and display various types of things and also help with supply exchange and bartering, and also display any object that is findable in the world on its own as decoration if we want. point is some players want mainly to decorate and some want organization/functon that is also visual (all iw ant is the utility of containers for every varying purpose, we hav ea lot of items, i want to make treasure caches that can both be hidden treasure or gifts i leave in a camp as a replacement for mailing ) everyone wants bobble and magazine to stop being something we EAT and instead get it added to the build like perk cards are, just have them turn into a card or have the UI keep their form but equip like cards in limited numbers with cooldowns and limitation. and let people display their collections as decoration and stop having it be junk that just gets eaten by the gameplay process. this is what players want. give us transparency, and give us PETS as loot.

actually that looks more like an old style implosion style nuke bomb then a nuke reactor to me.
---
Funny how people feel the need to ask not to be banned for experiencing a bug.  This community is nuts 
---
That's what I meant. Sorry.
---
This is a great point! I think the game might have the beggining of Easter eggs and just aren't fully fleshed out or finnished like the rest of the issues. Your point however if true is undeniably conniving.
---
But this should be obvious. People don't leave Yelp reviews when their expectations are met. They definitely do when they feel their expectations are not met. It "feels better" to be related to on a negative topic negatively than it does receiving negative reactions to positive or neutral topics.
---
Fallout is no different with plenty of wannabe detractors joining downvote campaigns because they want to be involved with a community but can't play the game or communicate at any competent level to make useful content.
---
Zzz. Same old game forum mentality.
---
Good shit guys
---
Scorchbeast uses sonic scream. Its super effective.
---
I have seen Mothman, but haven't seen Flatwoods monster. 
---
Yes! I'd be down for (poorly) shooting my way through events and stuff to get better gear, if you want!
---
There go to helping fellow survivors, defeating the common enemy, and rebuilding the world. The only thing different is that now we are the survivors.
---
Graham
---
Huh. It usually works for me. Earlier I had claimed Monongah power plant and wandered about 20 seconds away and when I came back it triggered the event. The only hostile ones I’ve seen were in the savage divide if that helps. If you see a regular one don’t get too close without engaging or it’ll disappear. Same with Flatwoods monster.
---
If one shotting then is not giving you the loot, then stop one shotting them.
---
Seriously, if you get them to agro and health Regen then they will almost always do loot. It takes a bit of skill and wise weapon selection, but is doable.
---
Do you want me to use my level 5?
---
The hunt begins I guess. 
---
Thank you for the information!
---
Don't know why they cap everything at 50. They had to know people would blow past that.
---
Right under the statue and by the table next to the river in the town on the west of the map with the "moth man" picture.  Good job on the theory here!
---
I only use them on landed SBs.
---
I use them regularly though.
---
I don't know about OP but if the reason someone has stopped playing entirely revolves around a certain set of legendary affixes....
---
Did they ever really play?
---
I’m grounded rn but if I get my grades up I can play with you 
---
Yeah, whatever you want! If you use your higher level, does that mean the enemies will be higher? Cause then I'm ded haha
---
Good point about the level.  As long as i kill them before they kill me the level doesn’t really matter.  I just figured I’d lower the risk of my my own death by avoiding level 100s.   As for workshops I haven’t done much with them in this game and don’t really feel like messing with them now. 
---
u/gnarcrew 
---
Negative on the white springs :(
---
Very good point,  could be nothing more than a nod to Lovecraft and each face is an individual unrelated Easter egg.
---
Yeah i joined about 8 &gt;lvl100 players fighting the SBQ yesterday; I stayed till about 7-8 mins left and no way were those chumps going to kill her. But absolutely nothing had loot, not even the scorched leaders.
---
Personally, Pacifist mode should change your name to a bright baby/sky blue to indicate Pacifist mode. it should block you from taking or doing slap damage to other players. your camp is immune to player damage but you cannot deal any damage to any workshop items, even if it is in a workshop owned by someone else.
---
also if you are in a group and PVP takes place and you have pacifist on, you should not be lumped in with it because someone wanted to fight. it is a pain when that happens and i lose my level's worth of caps because one guy keeps giving them a reason to cave my face in with a super sledge
---
PVP cap rewards should scale to the Lower player's level NO MATTER WHAT, the difference between a level 50 and a level 200 mostly boils down to the amount of caps you currently lose if you lose the PVP match, the level 200 loses 200 caps, and the level 50 loses 50 currently. sure the level 200 could have better gear. they could not. if the level 50 has better gear they walk away with a free merchant's selling supply. from a level stand point there really is no major stat difference between anyone over level 50 IMO
---
also i think Bounties should start at 5% of your cap supply and scale up to 50% depending on how horrible you are, would give more bounty hunters a reason to go after a criminal instead of a measly 10 caps, but have the base minimum start at 10 caps
---
Possibly. From what I’ve heard it averages out the levels of people in the area. But I’m not sure about in the forest.
---
Careful, speaking your mind over in this sub usually ends with the op getting chased out of town with a pitchfork 
---
I don't make the rules I just follow them. Here's your downvote.
---
I've had one of those for a while! The value actually changes to negative 1 sometimes 
---
I got a couple bounties and killed a griefer once.  17 more to go...
---
So these were a plan that dropped during beta? I used them as a low lvl can install kill slot of early game stuff. 
---
I waited for a solid 5 mins. 
---
“Bethesda disliked that”
---
Honestly use whatever character is more fun. I love to sneak around in fights (because I'm bad at them) and if I get overwhelmed, I'll run away before my chems run out. Otherwise, I use them for allllllll the buffs, all the time
---
Just keep bounty hunting you'll get there eventually. 
---
Each faction should have events like the enclave, but with a twist. specialized them, like get rose asking for certain drug areas with sealed doors requiring X, Y and Z.
---
Its because using exploits to enter certain areas like the Developer's room has lead to bannings. Really though those were more about stealing Atomic shop materials so they are probably fine. This is just a better safe than sorry backup.
---
Get urself 20 stims and have a buddy get knocked down by a level 1 enemy by the vault low level area
---
So you’re more interested in invalidating another person’s opinion than having a discussion?
---
I suppose they're dead because of Rad Rats, but realistically they shouldn't be.
---
I’ll use the level 76 because I’ve been trying to get the x01 jet pack.

Damn, well goodluck

Can a mod step in and ban this person please, thank you.

I voted for Dave

In Fallout 4, third-party mods can create custom terminals with custom text and even pictures: [https://i.imgur.com/MRjrlr0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MRjrlr0.jpg).  That sadly can't be done here unless the game suddenly allows third-party mods.
---
It's all about diversion and misdirection with the shills.
---
Happens on PS4 as well. It's such a pain!
---
Would be nice to have a skin for the Western Revolver and the Excavator Power Armor.
---
i am missing stuff too! omg!
---
Cool, Vents and useless PA plans if im lucky enough for loot to load!?! cant wait!
---
Baseball.

Tbh I’m just jumping on the meta with a complain and then question towards Beth, I love the game and it’s got it’s problems like every game but from a company that made games that were amazing (certain prospective) how do you mess up this bad considering the quake people dealt with the multiplayer aspect
---
I can't decide if people would be mad or happy if they raised the level cap of guns or not 
---
I almost didn't look at this when I got the notification. I thought it was going to be a serious psa about not inviting strangers to your c.a.m.p. I'm so glad I checked it out. Lol
---
I got them during the official game release.
---
‘no-nothing’?
---
Just because your wrong doesn't mean I lack a life. You wildly over estimate the effort it takes to type things up
---
Mire? Every time I'm walking through I get the Mothman, deathclaw Wendigo trio. Couple times I got them all fighting each other. Wendigo beats up the deathclaw, Mothman jumps up Wendigo then comes at me
---
Helps to intentionally drop all the fiber you have and then use a crafting bench to mark it as a "search" item. Then you'll always be unintentionally thinking about it while adventuring.
---
They should add it back , it was great.
---
Whiny entitlement threads make whiny entitled posters feel that whiny entitled complaints mean something, when in reality, they're just whiny? 
---
Ha, say that 5 times fast.
---
I'm alright with the legendary drops so far, very random, but they need to start putting good drops in safes and random places in the world, which actually makes wandering around and finding random stuff enjoyable again. I;d rather walk around scavenging for  junk them farming the same few legendaries over and over.
---
That's because the terrible developers are actually banning people for exploiting flaws in the game. 
---
I just one I can lock and operate on both sides
---
i've only encountered him 3-4 times, of those times i can only remember where i was going. That was my first encounter. I was heading to belching Betty to finish up the fire breathers quest line, he was on or two hills away from the entrance.
---
He shouldnt have to, Bethesda Austin should have and thats his point. No ones sperging at you to write code for a game so stfu
---
Do the event at the lighthouse where you collect fireflies.

I ran into an evil one south part of the mire too, not far from a red rocket.
---
Keypads are currently bugged. They operate like normal switches and the keypad is moot.
---
Or do Hunter/ Hunted? I haven’t, but I understand that by tuning your radio to that station you sign up for a four person hunt. Each person with one target, and when you kill your target you get theirs. Or something like that.  The only real downside is you have to hope other folks are interested. 
---
Yeah, I saw it after, but I was already rolling, and decided it was still sort of in context...
---
Level 188, 589 hours, Platinum trophy, PS4 Don't ask me why I'm still playing, I often ask myself... I guess I'm just waiting for RDR2 to get cheaper.
---
Or a troubleshooter prefix piece of crap
---
That's cute, but you're confused. The impetus for something being valid is not on the person who disagrees with it.
---
The Earth is not flat and the frogs are not gay. It's dishonest to engage these topics when the presenter is just going to splat hare brained theory and irrelevant links to somehow prove quantity counts more than relevance.
---
When someone shows up to Reddit to bleat about nerfing melee because they want to farm at Whitespring with a TSE ..... That's not a discussion. That's not valid. ;)
---
It wants you to phone home
---
Yeah. I gave up on this sub a week ago when a thoughtful, multi-paragraph comment on a thread (that was objective in nature) about the overall progress that’s been made was hidden, and a comment to the effect of “I don’t play this game, I’m just here to watch the fire and maybe throw some more gas on it” received numerous upvotes.  
---
Oh to be banned 
---
*you're
---
And it's more the fact that you're so butthurt you felt the need to have the last word in the form of a paragraph. My bad, I guess I'll just change my mind based on your genius argument from your position of inherent superiority /s
---
You going to break down and make an expletive filled post only to delete it?
---
Let me know in advance so I read it before you panic this time.
---
Pick a spot that has a high spawn chance and server hop only for that spawn. I did this for most of my play time today. I mean I did get some CHOICE loot from the Watoga ES legendary run but mostly either NO legendary spawn or just a 1 star. The best thing was a Unyielding Marine Leg with -20% junk weight and +1 endurance. I'm on PS4 if anyone wants to buy
---
Damn right. In France we know that, never invade Russia.
---
Yeah, especially sbq. After the tse, demo exp Nerf, I dumped 800+ 5.56 prime rounds into her face and got me an assassin knuckles. Lol
---
Level 141.  
---
Not sure how many hours, 
---
Still playing. Love the game when it functions correctly. Although I dedicate at least 3 hours daily to the game.  
---
Im just waiting for Bethesda to fix the game and bring in more content.
---
And hopefully, better, more manly  Atomic shop content 
---
I’ve just went offline for the night but I’ll happily play with you :) I’m on most days. GT AhoyMelliiee 
---
 He attacked me. His body is in the Great Divide lying on the ground.
---
I'm irrelevant but I approve this message. And approve of it. 
---
Yes that is the keyword. That's why I used it.
---
It's no different than believing they never planned it.
---
Infact, acting like this kinda thing wasn't heavily discussed is less plausible imo
---
Yeah hopefully they can increase that number, but i haven't seen much traction on the topic. It might be one of those subtle changes with the upcoming PvP Survival Mode.
---
Are people just having trouble finding the plans now?
---
Why are there 1000 posts on this reddit about 'wah wah i cant respec my character'??
---
I’ll take that as a “yes, and here’s my attempt to excuse it by typing as many words as possible.”
---
Maybe stop trying to wordsmith and just be honest instead.
---
The supply lines to the front were untenable from the huge distances, mud didn't help then they all froze, a terrible thing for the soldiers on both sides. 
---
War, it really does never change it's always horrific and sad.
---
Yes.
---
The atomic shop makes the creation club look like a dollar store.
---
On PC? There is a nexus mod for that.
---
It’s for all 3 consoles and as far as I know cross platform between at least Xbox and pc cause they run the same builds. But fallout also runs the same builds on console as PC. But that’s probably true the indie devs built the game from the ground up and it’s their own project 
---
I wish this post was upvoted higher but half the people in the sub are just here to complain about the game and want it to fail. Another interesting fact is that a majority of people in the sub have an outrageous amount of time played. 
---
Oh! I did wonder where they kept coming from... Thanks.
---
Yeah, the lack of hot fixes and the every-other-week patch deployment seems like there's only three people working on them but there are over a dozen working on the Atomic Shop.  Is that how a AAA game developer works?
---
I'll take that as "I can't understand and believe irrational complaints are only valid when they align with my opinion."
---
We'll disagree. You'll move on.
---
1 player limit in the world, password protected, no stash limit, can start events anytime
---
Get lucky with a armor drop from a legendary enemy.
---
Are you playing with sound on... I usually notice the music change before I spot him. I go into sneak as soon a the music change and look around
---
I don't understand why values aren't there in the first place
---
That "reactor" looks very similar to the nuke in the cathedral from fallout 1
---
I had an issue where I could take put a mod on my sledge. Relogging fixed it. 
---
What is out of my control now will not be in the future. Underestimate me at your peril.
---
You got me there, I'm a pretty casual gamer and this is probably my first heavy on line gaming
---
I love you assume a discussion with you makes me butt hurt. It isn't like this was the purpose this sub reddit was created. 
---
Ghouls annoy the hell out of me actually. I still despise the lunging that they've done since Fallout 4, and their movement speed is all wrong. The animations look like they're sped up and the lunge itself is janky as hell. 
---
To be fair, they're also not daily quests. They're game session quests. As soon as you log out or disconnect, they disappear. 
---
Most likely they are done, made their money, now onto ruining the next elder scrolls.
---
Currently busy, but I will send a message soon, should be from Proofpuppet.
---
Nope

COME HERE COMMIE BASTARD, ITS ONLY COLD AMERICAN LEAD! 
---
After the latest patch/hotfix, my pet Snallygaster went missing. I was afraid that this might happen, and made sure to check that he was indeed alive and well before I logged out for the update. Logged back in after installing the update, and he was gone. Unless he was somehow killed when I wasn't even logged in, something went horribly wrong and my creepy buddy is nowhere to be found.   
---
:(
---
Nice, I'd like to see how it turns out! The only concern I had with a 7x7 is that you'd end up a tier higher and might hit the upper limit of the build zone. 
---
Does the head lamp say something about the moth man? There’s a bug with those currently. Hang on to it to use after patch.
---
I just want to be able to snap my stairs to one side or the other of my half floors so I can make a proper staircase
---
Wait for bethesda to add factions in like a year
---
The atomic shop stuff has been done months and months in advanced. They're just putting them out on a schedule.
---
It's just the art team, anyway. 
---
So you're not going to leave some rant that you immediately delete this time?
---
You'll have to be clearer about that.
---
I'm on Xbox too and I have a lvl 10 melee account I can play with you on
---
I'm still pretty greatful to them for resurrecting the series, the was a looooong time between fo2 and fo3
---
You mean like people claiming the game was dying because it went on sale for Black Friday even though it returned to regular prices. People are committed to the game being a failure and Bethesda being all that is evil and like a doomsday cult when the comet doesn't hit they just keep kicking that can down the road.
---
Pretty sure the servers are hosted on AWS servers so if you are latent to them you will be latent to the game. 
---
But that's the best part!
---
This is a legitimate complaint about there being no NPC's.
---
I still enjoy the game, but I can definitely acknowledge this as a valid point. 
---
Especially compared to all the "blah! No npc's! Game must be terrible! Wah!" Rhetoric that went around.
---
Mothman at least easy to defeat, the Flatwoods Monster can pack a punch. Seen him 1shot people.

---
Run you fool
---
The absolute worst is when you have to defend against waves of scorchbeasts.  I just give up and server hop when that happens.
---
Lolz
---
Im on PC. I would that i could. My honest to goodness hope is that bethesda figures their shit out and we end up with something like no mans sky - bad start but ends up very much not hot garbage. They know that there is a gigantic money truck that back up and drop dem whale dollas if they can make this work. Games as a service are fantastic for balance sheets because of the constant cash flow if done correctly. Bethesda HAS to do this. Major projects are ballooning in costs and risk. FO76 is probably key to the future of the studio in keeping their core IP's alive as time goes on. TES games every 6-9 years are going to bankrupt them. Honestly, the better FO76 does, the more risks they can take. They can try new ideas without betting the company. Was this a rough beginning? Shit yes it was. But they can do it. ID software was basically toast after rage did a bunch of nothing. Then DOOM happened. Bethesda absolutely can and probably will salvage this and we end up with a solid drip feed of content and cosmetics that free them up to polish and keep on making those big tent poles. Skyrim remasters can only get you so close to the next TES and Startfield. A solid and vibrant GAS propping up the company gets them past the finish line.
---
I’ve gotten the tomahawk plans from a supply drop, but they are pretty rare. I’m not sure any of the perks affect their damage, so they are rather useless after level 20.
---
I remember when I first found those scorched body parts in jars at the Morgantown airport, I thought those would look cool on a shelf. Too bad we can't place items..
---
You make a sacrifice to todd howard
---
To not scare off the casuals. 
---
I have many angry words in my head that I will not be posting.
---
So far not a good option. You can make fuel but it makes very little for the amount of crafting
---
\*Upvotes\*nice
---
I'm just not good at the tightrope or the long wooden tightrope thing.
---
I think I figured it out. There seems to be an anti item spawn bubble that surrounds us upon login likely meant to combat server hopping. I logged at vault 76 and traveled back to my base and the deposits were magically back.
---
I found Freddy... He's not in any vault.
---
Then why don't you shut up and play another game if you don't like the game so much?
---
I've not had a lot of issues with bugs or server problems personally. People say they get disconnected all the time. Since the beggingin of January I've only been disconnected a handful of times.  People say legendary weapons don't drop when you kill legendary mobs. I've always had a legendary weapon drop.  Even taking into account the hyperbole people tend to use I've not had half the problems it seems others have had playing the game. 
---
You could do that today. Question is, would enough people want to? 
---
Because Bethesda is into BDSM, hence they force everyone to wear leather. 
---
Yep, he is where I bought mine from!
---
A simple solution is just make bare components weightless in the stash and make everything else weight it down. We know the amount of unique items in the invintory screens is what causes the unstability and gear already weighs a rather high amount. Why not make us have to manage what we actually don't need to hold on to? Playing this balancing game of keeping the material we need on hand and a little bit of gear thats rare or we might use is not fun considering the horror stories of people playing hours of management before actually playing the game. This simple change could keep our stash being this place where we put the stuff that we want in and this place we run to after we farm for hours to secure our resources. 
---
After a set of like 3-5 hours of play it should encourage players to come to camp to pick up that loot they got a while back that they can now use, ditch what they dont need anymore, secure the mats you got, cook food, maybe build a little, and repair gear. Make it like a 10 minute process. The current process discourages stashing loot for later and requires juggling between all the tabs making sure this strict number doesn't go over 600. All high level players will say they have a stash full of mats they worked for and all the gear they use is on the character. It shouldnt be like this. 
---
Imagine if in GTA 5 the more money you have in the bank the less guns you can hold, houses you can own, and cars you can have. That's the exact opposite of an economy, but that's the exact one we have in 76. Games should reward the player but also have hard limits in some parts so they will have a path of progression. 76 slams this limit on all that we do from the beginning that hurts more and more as we play.
---
&gt; Mods aren't coming to Fallout 76 at launch, however. Hines cautioned that mods may not be supported in Fallout 76 until November 2019 at the soonest. "It's going to be a lot of work. But mods and private servers are definitely coming," Hines said.

I got it when a level 111 guy in power armor and an axe came and started grieving on my level 75 melee build. Got in my armor and 2 shoted him with my blade of bastet. Got what he deseved I got his caps.
---
Yeah I have heard people say the same thing as that before. I know a bunch of people that are super incredulous about the number of issues I have had with the game. I would think I was crazy if I had not run into a bunch of people in my same position. Seems like stability is a luck of the draw type thing. 
---
Like i didn't know legendary weapons were in the game lol. Never saw a single one. 
---
What you're noticing is very common on reddit and the real world too.
---
Iirc its simple group think.
---
If 2 ppl have the same opionion but in 2 different groups you're going to side with the ppl in your group even though its the same opinion.
---
Dood, THANK YOU for posting the screenshots!
---
This is the true answer ^ 70 stalks of corn.
---
Same. Had munitions and Poseidon ....nope fuck me...disconnect! 
---
I wonder if anyone will reply to your comments now that you've shared visual proof.
---
A lot of people on this sub reddit get angry when asking for evidence.  If I didn't know any better I would say they are just making it all up.
---
Bye
---
The thing is, hotfixes are just that, a hot fix that happens seamlessly and doesn't bring the servers down. It may be something temporary to tide players into the next cold fix, but nowadays, the point is to not have to bring the servers down for urgent maintenance (like OSRS, WoW, and I guess Warframe etc.)
---
Cold fixes, or just "updates", are what Bethesda calls hotfixes, and it pisses me off to no end
---
&gt; Transparency has always been the exact opposite of how Bethesda like to operate. 
---
Reason number 493 why making a "live service" game is a weird move for them as a company.
---
Same, I can easily bet they had them planned, but then Battlefront II happened.
---
Tedious to play? My dear you don't understand the meaning of the word.
---
Hahaha. Yeah I am pretty much the same. Level 47. Just getting into power armor now though. Entered my first nuke zone last night in good ole Hazmat suit. Got a couple of shitty legendaries. Fuck being social. When I get up to the dropping a nuke stage I am going solo!
---
Easy to burn out when the flame of your game has little substance
---
Don't expect anything but a stimpak.
---
I say it every time I browse r/fallout
---
I wouldn't send a ticket, no matter if it was you or you seeing someone. They ban for any and everything.
---
People get banned for finding flaws in their game's code. Isn't that what they pay their testers to do? 
---
 I'll give that a try. Thanks. ;)
---
I agree that their scope was somewhat limited by keeping much of the fo4 mechanics, but I understand that there were reasons from some of those choices
---
BTW: a met a bathesda coder once, a bit after the launch of fo3, and professed my love of the series and gratitude and he seemed shocked... Or like he had PTSD from the the work environment and maybe amount of criticism that they take
---
And I have never had that problem. Just did the Uranium mine event. 3 legendary glowing mole people and 3 legendary weapons/armor.
---
It's a nuclear reactor, I recognise it from Fallout 4, though it is missing the shroud that goes around it...
---
Yeesh, comments like these are so lame. 
---
Cheapest route all sellers costing 65 caps thats 1335 profit

This is the smallest triangular route covering all traders.
---
I am camped near harpers ferry so usually run there i would recommend camping near to one of the places on the route.
---
If memory serves there was also a metal face like that on the front of Fort Hagen in Fallout 4
---
Posts like these are so lame. 
---
It's weird to think, in the just under 4 months that the game has been out, there really haven't been any substantial changes. 
---
There have been a few tweaks, some mostly QoL stuff that should've been there from the start, and even some unnecessary balancing "changes". It's a shame really
---
The best is when your selling a series of items and the “highlighted item bar” sudden Ed Lynch goes to the preceding item instead of the following item. *Sold* *poof* *gone*
---
Doesn’t show up in vendor items list, never to be seen again😢 
---
Wow a 2 month old account that only exists to complain about this game is complaining about this game.
---
Insert shocked pikachu face
---
It's the creations engines fault. While the creation engine is generally great for persistence in comparison to a lot of other engines, it just doesn't seem like it's able to handle it with so many others keeping their items, looting, etc
---
U will burn through ammo fighting the sbq. Some chems will help but either way its gonna use quite a lot of time and resources
---
I saw one. It didn't attack me either. Just sorta stood there doing nothing 
---
Damn, that sucks. I really wish Bethesda would kick it in gear with the server stability or at the least an option to rejoin a server. It baffles me how they keep focusing on nerfs and "balance" while huge glaring bugs like this are driving off more and more players every day since day 1. Silos and SBQ are this game's endgame content and it's constantly crashing on people. How is that not a higher priority for them to fix?
---
So clearly you have never played a game like this before.
---
good loot?
---
Lols yea i agree completely
---
Sorry for voicing my issues with this game in hopes that it can lead to fixes so that I can have fun with friends while playing it.
---
Which is lame
---
According to gamepidia 40% for all AP mods
---
Well, they obviously wouldn't know the game would be "trash" if they didn't bother researching it at all, now would they?
---
Honestly, I just started a new character. Easier to level anew than bother to respec to that degree.
---
another one of "these" threads???  :-(
---
Go ahead and vent, but not every one will appreciate your sentiments and complaining. Good luck in all your future gaming. 
---
&gt;The people at Bethesda are trying their best
---
Oh, thanks for letting us know. Next time I completely fuck up I'll be sure to let my client know I was trying my best and they should just accept that.
---
&gt; but with the constant stream of unrealistic expectations
---
You mean like making the game fit for release 3 months after release?
---
&gt;some of the actual realistic requests go unheard.
---
Such as?
---
&gt;At least if your going to post negative comments please make your requests reasonable and don't expect it to be fixed in the next update **give the Bethesda team time** and make your expectations reasonable.
---
This was the same tired excuse being used in December. And January.
---
&gt;trying to keep the game fresh
---
'Hey guys, we're happy to announce that the next bit of major content is actually no new content just removing slap damage from PvP'. Wow so fresh.
---
Not your fault OP. It's taboo to be negatively opinionated on this sub.
---
Melee
---
The enemies that drop them are not common. First time I saw two back to back was during uranium fever event
---
Unless your one of the brave souls that speak out against the EvIL dEVeloPerS rUiNINg tHe GAmE
---
I mean, we’ve got Mr. Handy Buzzsaws so why not
---
That is very random 
---
Do you really love the lamp or you just saying it Because you say it?
---
From your source.
---
“and it’s worth remembering all of this just comes from looking at a bunch of code out of context.”
---
And that’s not how claims work, I can’t show you a time someone didn’t steal from me because that doesn’t prove shit. 
---
So your whole argument is built on conjecture, and unproven claims.
---
disconnected from server 6 times within an hour. fuck this game. 
---
Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. 
---
I personally wouldve just made buffed the horribbke energy weapons and some of the automatic weapons and pistols. No nerfs to anything. Make stronger enemies appear and have more rewards because they all suck. Seperate dmg from pvp and pve even now I can oneshot players in powerarmor.
---
You browse that shit sub?
---
Oh well 
---
Flight helmet 
---
I was given the ability to rejoin my team but my game crashed every time I pressed it. Had to restart my computer to get into the game again.
---
It’s 600 now 
---
Thanks! Same exact issue. Not sure what worked, but I fast traveled away to my camp, then back to top if world. After that I turned all side quests on and then off. Then, turned “missing link” and “keys to the past” on, and then both off. Approached rose again, and (in xbone) pressed a A 5 times in a row— she finally changed her tune from “got those key fragments for me?” To “I’ll take those key fragments off you.” 
---
Maybe it was that he was not happy with some of the game design choices made way back in fo3
---
Hahaha 
---
The community isn't nuts, the developers are. 
---
Yes sry, forgot.
---
Is it really? For some reason I always imagined the flight helmet like a young Anakin helmet. Thanks!
---
Rad away, soup, puree, and I believe some other healing recipes...  But I mostly make soup and puree with it.
---
After 87 levels and 200 hours of playing, I finally found the mothman. I was just strolling around the forest on my way to Charleston and all the sudden I heard this cicada like noise and turned around to see the mothman with purple eyes staring at me. I got a little closer and his eyes turned red, and at that moment I knew it was on. 
---
Broadsider, harpoon gun. Railway rifle should really be a heavy weapon TBH- look how big that thing is. 
---
Just seperating 2 shot from exploding and only give a 50 pct dmg bonus from demo expert would have been just fine. Honestly it was the proliferation of duped tse's that caused the nerf. 95 pct of them were duped.
---
I kind of gathered, but I'm at work right now. Kind of hard to check that from here. 
---
Unrealistic expectations. Like not getting disconnected 5 times a session. Good grief.......
---
Link is in description of video. Forgot to say
---
It's tough. I was at about level 50 when I tried alone, and yeah... I'm at level 78 and still haven't confronted a SBQ. These single, double and triple Scorchbeasts are hard enough now lol
---
I’m level 71 and only first saw a Mothman Friday. It was bugged though, just sat there letting me kill it and only started flying around _after_ it died. Strange.
---
I usually fill up the overseers stash box in the church in flat woods. Always low level people there, so I leave my excess food and plans
---
That’s ok! 💕
---
no idea but that seemed to be my case when messing around with light boxes and lost more space when I accidentally scrapped one and couldn’t place it back
---
Before you "laid the lead," did you buy it dinner first? 
---
It’s not. Someone dug into the game files, it’s supposedly 40% for Perforating and 30% for penetrating+reload/capacity. I don’t know exact values, but I DID test with a hunting rifle and a 10mm pistol, and they were definitely different values. 
---
Remember to wipe
---
Press F to pay respects the shit servers claimed another one 
---
RIP ammo.
---
I just gave you a clear cut double standard that 100% undeniably exists and you wave it off.
---
Nice.
---
I've been seeing it more and more in general game adverts. Something simple like gamefly
---
No problem 
---
Just advertising it's been out here In Aus since release date last year 😋

You're RIGHT!!!!!! I didn't know that! https://fallout4.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Fallout-4/fort_hagen.jpg And it's the same face that appears in Whitespring. AND: I just came back from Garaham State. THIS FACE IS THERE TOO! https://i.imgur.com/eB73o16.png Also: in the Hornwright State, the male face also appears! https://i.imgur.com/qFqS4b6.png I trully think that it's not just a case of simple asset reuse. Gonna study Fort Hagen now. Thanks a lot!!!! =]]]]]]]]]

The word "Sentinel" will not be in the armor's description. I believe It is armor which has -15% damage taken or -8% damage from players listed in the armor's specs...
---
Dude. This comment. Gold 
---
Mhm, good luck :)
---
True that 
---
Oh cool!  Ran into my first one of those things earlier today.
---
I assume PC only have had the glitch occur?
---
For someone that enjoys using the word kid as an insult, you sure do act like one.
---
It's like you think copy pasting my other comments is somehow shocking or something. You must be some kind of hacker dude
---
Occasionally.  It is fun watching a hive mind at work. And out of any sub that one best gets described as a hive mind. 
---
One person was complaining about the narrative decline and lore breaks of FO4 leading to issues in 76. Asked for specific examples and immediately say to watch a youtuber. They literally could not reply in their own words issues.
---
They linked 3 videos with such grand complaints like not being able to drink out of the toilet and a terminal saying potatoes are extinct. 
---
I definitely wouldn’t have minded the nerf if they fixed the two shot accuracy
---
Add me. GT:slimjim72384
---
Well then it depends on the armor level of the mob in question 
---
I think it was the turning off and back on the quests that did it 
---
In one of the earlier games a merchant was selling “iguana meat” which was secretly human meat
---
Thank you!!! Gonna look for it! =\]\]
---
I mean, the signs were pretty clear. Beth even told us it'd be shit before release. They made a fancy letter and everything just before Beta .
---
Somehow people were like
---
"zomg this is so sweet :). I can't believe Bethesda is this nice" 
---
So, how is it going
---
Fun! I melee then, of course.
---
Have you tried bloodied heavy guns? It's a very nice damage buff, esp with adrenal reaction and thus uses less ammo.
---
Me too. I believe we will see a lot more story development with the DLCs... fingers crossed, anyway...  =\]\]
---
Wow, I must have listened to him for a long time. I recall this specific line *very* well.
---
This was so fuckin sweet :)
---
This is not true. The armor can be named “Sentinel”.
---
I am looming at a Sentinel Chest and Sentinal Leg at this very moment. -15% dmg while standing still is the sentinel perk, -8% dmg from players is the assassins perk.
---
My only suggestion is not to move your head once you’ve picked a line forwards and side to side a little if you need to correct only turn your sight when your not moving.
---
level 43 - 70 hours played (only solo). Taking a break from the game to play some older fallout's and refresh my mind.
---
That's a Vault-Tec Super-Reactor. You can build them in FO4 with the Vault-Tec Workshop.
---
What does that do? 
---
There is no concrete definition for "hot fix". Sure you can agree that they should be implemented like in the games you listed but really a hot fix is just whatever the company decides to call it. 
---
So I guess working on stability isn't an improvement... I haven't had any crashes rec decently
---
Honestly, if placing a camp would be blocking spawns then there would be nothing attacking camps, and since there is enemies who are attacking camps then it means that spawns aren't blocked. Furthermore, that spot right in front of the Charleston Station always has stuff spawning there even if a camp is placed.
---
&gt; I can’t show you a time someone didn’t steal from me because that doesn’t prove shit.  
---
that's my point, so you can't then claim that it never happened
---
&gt; You already admitted you stopped playing awhile ago, just leave. You’re  not bringing light to anything, you’re not helping save the game, you’re  just griefing a sub that still has some people that enjoy the game,  why? What’s the purpose of that? Bored? Angry? Sad? Never mind that’s  like 90% of reddit. 
---
you sound like a proper whiny cunt, I don't have to leave, I am waiting for more content before I get back into it, I beat the main story and like 90% of the rest, have all the gear I want, have all the perk cards I want, I have every right to be here and hopefully the game continues to be updated.  and how am I griefing a sub?  all I fucking said was lootboxes were probably going to be a thing and you fucking flipped, come off it mate...
---
No they ban their testers too, that's why there are so many bugs.
---
They should buff the chainsaw as well
---
The hoarde events also spawn a guaranteed legendary, scaling to which region it’s located it
---
Games developers are the most oppressed people on earth. /s
---
Firefly
---
Just plain out will give you rads , great for getting mutations anywhere 
---
Same with you ya whinge 
---
Not a cash grab btw 
---
It's still on our buses. 
---
You "demand" transparency.
---
Absolutely. Red wood or black polymer furniture, there are many ways to make the handmade a sexy beast. Weapon skins give weapons personalities which is exactly what people want in the wasteland! 
---
You only do 335? Damn son, I’m in power armor and do 1081 with my all rise. Adrenaline is hell of a thing. 
---
That's my spot too. 
---
You mean posting and then abruptly deleting, per your usual.
---
Yes, thank you. I remember seeing a whole bunch of Super Mutant legendaries all clustered together from this event on The General's Steakhouse.
---
Well crud. It said "Red Tactical" on the vendor, but in the crafting window it says Mothman Red. 
---
I'm actually convinced they have a rather large team on It, they're just incompetent. All Bethesda games are horribly programmed and scripted
---
Bethesda is nuts for shitting on the few fans they have left, especially when it's not the fans fault stumbling upon their shitty programming. 
---
That’s entirely a different topic but imho the game is well balanced after latest patch. 
---
Was an office reference 
---
Well that’s the first refreshing thing you’ve said: you admit to your deficiency and embrace it happily, and bid everyone who disagrees to go away. Most people simply double down on their contrivance but you are different and revel in it. Not sure what’s worse but I won’t be here to find out. Have a day, I guess.
---
Where in the civic center? Im guessing 'on top' is not the roof
---
No, it seems like no matter what you post, you will be downvoted. 
---
People who are upset downvote positive posts and say this sub is a fanboy circlejerk.
---
People who are enjoying the game downvote the negative posts and say the sub's a hater circlejerk.
---
This game, wherever you stand on it, has divided the community, but it's nothing new for the Fallout community. Happened when fallout 3 took the game into 3d, happened again with new Vegas, and then again with FO4. 
---
Giving them time to fix the game in a patch update kills the game rolling it back 2 patches, the way it's going next month we will be playing a live alpha version lol.
---
My adrenaline is only rank 3 and the max I've seen is like 551 so I'm doing 1,100 damage to a full health enemy. I'm excited to move some points around and level up adrenaline to 5 and see what I can get 
---
Funny actually, I looked up hot fix while writing the comment and realised that, but carried on writing anyway lol
---
If you think that's bad, look at the top posts. 
---
You really don't understand. I've seen miscommunication but it seems like you're just having a debate with yourself that's probably built on TSE farming the Whitespring.
---
Keep trying. One day you might sort out the rest of the game.
---
Yeah I've been focusing on those perks.
---
Not sure why I'm getting downvoted so much, this is all just my opinion.  I'm not ranting, just stating how I'd make it more fun for casual SPers.
---
You mentioned that Vault 63 looks like it leads to a mine.  A Breach and Clear event happens virtually on top of Vault 63.  It would be cool if they could tie the two together as one story line.
---
Definitely more skins for the shotguns, those are probably the most popular weapons and who doesn’t want theirs to look a little different! 
---
headline:
---
&gt;People That Don't Play A Game Are More Critical Of IT!
---
real bright analysis there...
---
Sorry bud. Guess game isn't for you. 
---
This could also help to reduce the server overload... all (non-duped) legendaries are unique ítems, everyone uses one line in the stash/character, the same that 3.645 pcs of anything do it.
---
Well, at least we get to see the inside like this. If this game receives any kind of content update, like opening the vaults, I'll be utterly shocked.
---
Monster mash doesn’t start for me anymore either, anyone know if that’s was with the patch or if it bugs sometimes? 
---
dropping like flies...

Time to write an essay 😒
---
I've found a way to make it work with a switch inside and out but it's not the prettiest of solutions. It uses a glitch to get wires through walls. It can probably be done a little better but it works for me. 
---
Probably not, but honestly I could probably make a list of a couple hundred things that “should be easy to fix” that they haven’t even acknowledged yet. Honestly it’s kind of pathetic at this point. Literally 1 guy tasked with cleaning up “easy shit” could probably do it in a week or two. 
---
5 months now and doesnt seem they will ever look at energy weapons.
---
I had to look up how to get 3 and 3 goty to work on windows 8/10 and it was as easy as installing games for windows live on my pc from [microsoft.com](https://microsoft.com) your computer only needs the DDL files you don't even have to login
---
Very presumptuous. He could have at least asked to buy you a drink first.
---
L 198, 250+ hours but I haven't played in about a week.
---
I mean beth needs needs to know what they are  doing is horrendous. Honestly I rather they keep seeing how unhappy people are.
---
With the amount of people giving up on the game, I'm concerned about how much effort we can expect to see Bethesda actually put in toward the game's future. Each patch seems to introduce a whole bunch of new problems. I'm beginning to wonder if it's best for them to just distance themselves from the game. I've personally moved on myself. My friends that bought the game have moved on. No one on my PS4 friend's list plays it anymore. 
---
Obviously some are still playing, but I'd be curious to see the numbers of active players from launch compared to now. It's sad that this is happening, but I'm also very upset with Bethesda. Feels like they released a game that wasn't even close to finished in order to earn some profit until Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6. This trend of "release now, fix later" has got to stop, and Fallout 76 is the worst offender. Especially because I don't think that the game will ever reach the level that were were lead to believe. Too many players have given up, and you can only pour so many resources into a game that's lost so much of its playerbase.
---
Cause like everyone else he paid for the game has the right to say why he feels the game is fundamentally flawed?
---
I was in a fight earlier and we couldn't damage her, absolutely nothing her health bar didn't move, everybody even gave up and left 
---
Melee has its downsides. You're constantly getting diseased (even with Vegetable Medley Soup), you have to run from one enemy to the next while getting shot, you can't hide in stealth and get the 2X stealth dmg bonus, and don't forget monsters do melee damage too.  Melee should do more damage than ranged because of this. If it didn't, there'd be no advantage to melee and nobody'd use it.
---
Can we just have a garage door where you click on the door for it to open? Like the regular doors? Because I just want to open it from either side without a headache.
---
No.
---
I'm honestly about ready to give up on it. I'm currently playing, but with everything that's been happening; the unfixes with patches, other things going wrong, bugs being introduced BY THE PATCHES. Love the series, love the lore, love all the other fallouts. It takes almost two minutes for the world to initialize when i log in, if i try to open my pip boy while that's happening the app doesnt exactly freeze, but id take that over what it actually does. But, I'm still playing and would like to see it get better
---
They still posting the no durr responses and not understanding this decision has tanked the game so hard. They didnt need to write the game this way.
---
.....
---
You were wearing a tinfoil hat?
---
And he was friendly?
---
New perk unlocked!
---
Accessed an unreachable area....
---
They're coming, just give it time. Assuming the game lasts for more than a few months, that is.
---
Yes, the 45 degree rotation makes it almost impossible to place in my CAMP. I paid a lot of in-game currency for that skin and I would appreciate if it functions like the other skins in the game and doesn't change the way in-game items work. Vault-tec weapons workbench is pretty much unusable in this stage.
---
It's the actual enimies attack that has been glitched somehow into a weapon. Shouldn't be possible but you know fallout anything is.
---
So don't sell it keep it maybe it'll be useful someday somewhere somehow 
---
Given the sheer amount of mutants in the place, it's incredibly likely to find at least one at West-Tek, but by no means a guarantee.
---
In fact I killed two 3* yesterday that didn't drop a legendary at all. Was disappointed, but they have "a chance" to drop one so just went on my merry way. 
---
Get Starched Genes perk maxed out and do the same with Class Freak. Class Freak reduces the negative effects of mutations while Starched Genes allows you to take Rad Away with out losing a mutation. Remember to turn Starched Genes "off" to get a mutation and "on" to keep or take Rad Away. 
---
That's what she said!
---
Inside, on the top where the main kitchen area is. 
---
No idea, I know for Uranium Fever I had to stand next to the robot for a few seconds before it started. Unsure how they changed Monster Mash but it used to trigger for me once I entered.
---
It’s a bugged item. It literally does nothing and I think you can loot it off a snalleygaster when there’s a bunch of lag
---
It was really fun, but the weapons become unusable after level 25, then you can get so much better...
---
Is #3 the one near the scout camp? That one worked for me once &amp; never again the dirty bugger. Guessing patch freaked it out or I got incredibly lucky. 
---
Oh I dunno it’s kinda cool, like stepping into a Way Back Machine and see what it was like when it was buggy and so undeveloped and basic and- HEY WAIT A MINUTE!
---
I've had a Mythic Mothman spawn in my CAMP, and I live on the border of the Savage Divide and the Mire. Also have had 2 different Flatwoods aliens spawn there too. Wish I could find these super rare creatures more.
---
but....the look is timeless lol
---
In my view it's because the slog of the silos combined with nerfed ghoul EXP gains and boring scorchbeast queen fight mean nobody has a reason to launch them. I think they should buff exp given by ghouls at least so people start nuking the Whitesprings again. 
---
You can upgrade them to Lv. 45, but this is easily overlooked because you do it through the Craft menu at a Workbench, not Modify.  It takes the current weapon as a crafting component.
---
So you logged out and then logged back in at fault 76 ? Sorry had the same problem
---
Don’t call me nuts. I only occasionally eat my toenails. 
---
Yeah that’s it. Went there a month ago no dice. Tried again today and nothing.
---
Loves carpet and desk too.
---
Doesnt change the fact that the weapons suck... they could’ve executed something like that soooo much better
---
Arguably the best quest in 76.
---
It's too bad that of all the recurring Dailies or Events, they didn't do one with the Order of Mystery.
---
that really should be added in the future.
---
It'll never happen; Bethesda's clearly given up on fixing this game, to say nothing of expanding it. 
---
I was about to say the engine can’t handle vehicles... but Skyrim has horses. Hmmmm.
---
&gt;You mean like making the game fit for release 3 months after release?
---
debatable. It's still not fit for release. I doubt it will be for another year or so. 
---
&gt;'Hey guys, we're happy to announce that the next bit of major content is actually no new content just removing slap damage from PvP'. Wow so fresh.
---
Agreed. LMFAO. You're pretty funny. 
---
Is this dude mental? The fuck is he trying to say, and all his responses... the hell?
---
Amazing that the best storyline in the game is in regards to assisting the franchise's villains.
---
The proof is in the game code.... They’re literally coded into the game and atom shop images for packs of lunchboxes have been datamined. They’ve either postponed or abandoned the idea. It isn’t “bullshit.”
---
They should've had mods like they did in fallout 4
---
HEY GUYS I CAME HERE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS GAME.... HEY!! STOP BEING DISSATISFIED AND LIKE THIS GAME!!!!
---
It would take more effort to unsub. And it's usually not very high up. And I usually browse r/all anyways. And I'm sure I'm subbed to some other sub I dont oay attention to anymore, like atlas.
---
Great job dude you figured it all out. Ya know, except you got it all wrong. You are literally the embodiment of people who still play this game. Dumb as shit.
---
No I agree. I just think it’s smarter for Bethesda to clean them up automatically than to hope players loot everything all the time... at least in the long term.
---
Your idea is a great bandaid solution to their server problems 
---
I found Todd Howard's name in the game. if you go to the Grafton Steel Yard and find the chemistry bench in the rolling mill, on the perodic table on the wall, Todd howard has his name in fine print underneath the main title on the poster.
---
I haven't tried to take a power plant at all, and I don't take resource point anymore after the collectors were nerfed a while back. I dont need that many, only one or two every other time I log in. With the lack of anything to do at this point (lv 74) I might as well just walk in big circles.
---
Pistol or revolvers are a good combo with melee builds. I would suggest a western revolver with atleast a small investment into the pistol perks.   
---
Otuside of that shotguns are just stacking your CQB, so you might want soemthing for ranged easy picking on weaker targets.   
---
Tehre are a few options.  
---
M79 with limited ammo  
---
western revolver or single action for high DPH especially if you can hit heads  
---
Hunting rifle, good skill means you can wipe most easy enemies, almost a requirement in some areas with high level turrets to have atleast one high ranged option.  
---
Or yeah shotgun, preferably with explosive effect two shot not needed you are just mass damaging. 
---
Balls. I've got a few of those in my inventory I was gonna clear. Had no idea it was fully bugged, thought it was just me haha
---
Okay, I don’t want to have to repeat the lecture my professor did in my first year of college so here’s a link.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)
---
If someone makes a claim, i.e. “You can steal weapons from someone while trading,” then the onus is on that person to support that claim with evidence of it. That evidence would be a video of someone trading with someone and taking their weapon or having it taken. There are no videos of this that I’ve found. 
---
“You sound like a proper whiny cunt”
---
*proceeds to sound like a proper whiny cunt*
---
I don’t give a shit what you’ve done in game, hanging around here harassing people by flooding a thread with the same bullshit comment (that’s a claim I proved, see it’s like first year uni) over and over and over is just fucking sad.
---
You’ve made 31% of the comments in this thread alone bud.
---
The plant on the boarder of the first and ash heap that is it. 
---
That's because actively exploiting bugs is a bannable offense per the ToS.  
---
This is a different situation.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s completely bugged. Or maybe just for a lucky few. I’ve heard of others not being able to dig.
---
Yep happens the moment you get rad worms. That illness is bugged and fucking everything up. 
---
From lower;
---
And that’s not how claims work, I can’t show you a time someone didn’t steal from me because that doesn’t prove shit.
---
Edit: also from your source;
---
“These lunch boxes could be a temporary addition tied to a holiday event, though they are a permanent fixture in Fallout Shelter. That’s a free-to-play mobile game, however, where microtransactions are par for the course, so Fallout 76 following suit is not a given.”
---
You already admitted you stopped playing awhile ago, just leave. You’re not bringing light to anything, you’re not helping save the game, you’re just griefing a sub that still has some people that enjoy the game, why? What’s the purpose of that? Bored? Angry? Sad? Never mind that’s like 90% of reddit.”
---
Yeah, it is kinda bullshit.
---
It did
---
Why don't you shut up and go post this BS in a thread praising the game if you don't like my post so much?
---
Good to hear it, soldier.
---
It's time for you to move on instead of posting here, I guess.
---
Beautiful graph! Congrats on your recovery!
---
Lol you realize if nobody is playing and theres no reason to fork over money for microtransactions Bethesda will drop the game. They dont give a shit if you enjoy it.
---
I’m talking Adrenal Reaction mutation. More damage the less health you have, something like 90% damage at 10% health, but I’m usually around 10-30% health. In power armor with Emergency Protocol chest mod, and Nerd Rage, you’re still pretty tough and do a ton of damage. I can take a hit from the queen, but if she hits me twice without me healing in between I might be in trouble. I keep diluted stimpacks hotkeyed for her. 
---
 Lever Action. I fight em' all the time with a Lever Action and the Sword of Bastet. The strong receiver with hip shot is perfect. 
---
 I don't use VATS, and I figure I get about half of my 116 bullets into her. I have brought level 50s down with little else but if they land the Sword is beastly. ;)
---
it would be hilarious if this would be true:
---
random bethesda dev; "so yeah we just re-used textures cuz it saved time"
---
still, nice find.. i fear it is also a great idea or plan by the designers behind the game, but something that never got finished by the dev cuz of time and money
---
Is there a honeypot I've missed there? I run through it a bunch but think it's often probably been picked clean before I get there. I'm on a seemingly fresh server right now (closed doors and low level ghouls at The Whitespring!?) so I'm gonna shoot down there and see what's up.
---
What is “it”?
---
Huh. Well, standing still stance is still the same (left leg forward), but I don’t think melee is in that stance much. 
---
+karma
---
I said this in another topic, but I'll say it again here:
---
The playerbase has declined significantly since launch. I don't know the actual numbers so it's impossible to tell just how many people have moved on, but I do know that I've personally moved on and nobody on my friends list plays anymore. In fact, some have gone back to Fallout 4.
---
Point is, there aren't many people left playing. There just isn't enough to do in the game. Server hopping over and over again until you find a nuke zone isn't my idea of fun, especially when the rewards are hardly ever worth the hassle.
---
Meanwhile, Bethesda keeps putting out updates that fix a couple problems but also introduce a handful of NEW problems. It's like the game has gotten worse over time instead of better. No new content of any significance, and XP gains have been cut by like 65% or so. That to me says that instead of working hard on new content, they'll be nerfing everything to make the game last longer. That's a horrible method of extending someone's playtime. 
---
So with all that in mind, I'm not expecting the game to be fixed. They'll make minor changes and hopefully get rid of some of the more major issues, but with the small playerbase there's just no reason to spend a ton of resources on the game. I'm glad people still find enjoyment and I'd never dream of trying to convince them that it's a bad game or anything. Hell, some of my 200 hours spent on the game were a ton of fun. But eventually I just realized that I was experiencing frustration and boredom far more often than I was actually having fun, and knew that it was time to move on to other games. Fallout 76 felt like working a mundane job that I wasn't getting paid to do. 
---
I hope I'm wrong, and that Bethesda has major plans that will turn the game around. But if I were in their shoes, I'd try to distance myself from it. Again, fix the major bugs, add a bit of new content to fulfill that promise, and leave it at that. The next generation of consoles are likely coming in 2020 and it would be a mistake to go all in on making massive upgrades/changes in order to bring back all the fans that they lost. 
---
Also, to correct you, plenty of people did ask for a PVP mode. But not in this way. It's silly that progress carries over to both modes, and if you're going to have a PVP mode, then make the regular mode completely PVE. It's not rocket science, and it baffles me that they couldn't just give us separate PVE and PVP servers. Instead we're going to have PVP servers and semi-PVP servers. I have no earthly idea what they're even trying to do with this game anymore, and to be honest, I don't think they know either.  
---
That's awesome! I'm about to sign off, but can I add you to play a different night?
---
The problem with Bethesda is that these @#&amp;(!&amp; don't know how to write code, much less manage code revisions and builds.
---
I won't bore everyone with the details but basically you have a check out process in which you put things into the code and ensure that with each build, there are the fixes put in that will be there with each subsequent release.  Clearly what is going on here (as seen with things like the Bobby pin and several others) is that someone stupidly worked on a prior release of code where the bug was still in it, did some NEWER modifications to it and then submitted it.  That in turn caused the prior fixes to be overwritten and new ones to now show up.  Its honestly the dumbest thing I've ever seen and is honestly something that a company this old should NEVER ever have happen.  I mean there are far newer companies out there that clearly have far better code check in (and out) processes to ensure that bugs are not reintroduced for this exact reason.  Its honestly unacceptable that with all the tools, repository pieces, "github" like environments that companies can setup that such a process was broken this bad.  Its rather sad and a sign of the times that maybe Bethesda is putting their noobs in play to fix things because its clear experienced coders would never let this happen.  Also a clear sign of the "we aren't getting the $$ we put into the game" so put the less experienced developers onto it so the good ones can work on software that WILL make them money.
---
but what do I know.
---
(That 1081 is without nerd rage or adrenaline active; I was at about 25% health just standing around when I quoted that)
---
I believe it was datamined and never put into the patch notes.
---
Level 41 on PS4, a bit over 80 hours, 99% solo and I've only done a handful of events.  I preordered the beta, actually I upgraded to PS4 Pro just for this, I just don't get to play often due to family obligations. 
---
Participated in one Whitesprings nuke, which game me 3 levels but broke 3 guns and used literally ALL my ammo.
---
Such a good story the last holos are my favourite in the game.
---
I remember someone mentioning a slot limit when the stash issues were a top topic. Id sooner like to see a slot limit rather than a weight limit.
---
I'm pretty sure the lack of any major updates about the game's future is because Bethesda themselves have no clue how to go about fixing their mess, especially when most of the playerbase has already given up and moved on to other games. 
---
And to a certain extent I'll buy that...   
---
But not x4 to x10 as much damage to that one leg
---
Well, that's the absolute maximum effort they're going to put into it, that's for sure. At least putting up a poster won't cause 50 new bugs in-game.
---
Someone else said they can be found in the government supply drops. I’m currently farming them to see. No luck so far. 
---
For the record, account wide since I’ve started the game I’ve probably dropped 20 supply drops and not seen plans, so they might be really rare.
---
What is normie qualifications
---
&gt;Fallout76Prefs.ini
---
hahahah No, I didnt, ill try that! Thanks for the advice!!!
---
Really pathetic
---
No such thing as a fresh server all low level ghouls mean is a low level spawned them by getting there before you. 
---
Oh my bad I got them confused. I currently can't run power armor because all of my armor has weapon weight reduction so even with calibrated shocks I'm like 140 pounds overweight. With speed demon it's not that bad so I might look into getting that mutation and seeing how I feel about it. What's the negative affects?
---
&gt; Yeah just using Bethesda cause this is a fallout sub. Makes no sense how indie companies can be on top of their shit but billion dollar companies are full of excuses.
---
because indy game devs are in charge and usually play the game they work on .... in AAA, shareholders are in charge and have never touched a video game in their lives. 
---
I use legendary weapons that have increased limb damage so i can cripple wings
---
Can sell you 70 various nukas for 490 that's 7 per
---
I noticed this the other day and couldn't figure out why I was wanted - explains so much.  Turned out I had reactive plates on my armor - and another user hit me and it must have hit them back.  We were fighting in close quarters against some Scorched and they must have hit me.  Really dumb game design and a bug.
---
No it can't. The devs have no interest in anything but micro-transactions, battle royal modes, and nerfs, and the press surrounding the game is insurmountably bad. No Man's Sky didn't receive this much hate at launch. This game, this franchise, and possibly Bethesda, are just like the NPCs in-game; dead and rotting. 
---
I’m sick of these antisocial PC gamers all over this sub who have played 1p RPGs their whole life talking about how bad and desolate the community is... when the reality is that it’s actually full of players exploring, learning, trading, trolling, etc just because YOU are curled up in a little shell in your dark room, unwilling to socialize doesn’t mean the rest of us are, sorry. 
---
If my comment truly spoke volumes to the type of person / gamer you are maybe you should get off reddit and work on yourself! Sorry but the truth hurts sometimes. 
---
Awesome story. I like trying to help out lower level peeps. Because I had someone do the same for me. I was getting swarmed by ghouls early on. And someone just bounced in and wrecked them like it was nothing. Now I can be that person! It's fun! 
---
The other day I actually had to get on a mic to let a level 13 know that I was trying to give them water and stimpaks packs....lol
---
Couldn't have made this an album? 
---
So you just put your power armor on before round one ended? And then when round two started, it directed you to a new mask? 
---
Just added three more as I'm typing 
---
Thanks, but only looking for a spot for regular Nukas for the daily resource grind.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Is bos armor the best in the game?
---
Found a mythic one last night on the WhiteSprings golf course.
---
I can’t get over the awkward writing in that game, the way they use the second person for every option is just so strained. 
---
Fair enough, but when all the unlocked doors are closed it feels like nobody has been there in a while.
---
You miss the images of the lunchbox packs and the YouTube videos showing lunchboxes in the dev room with the atomic shop symbol? My whole argument is that these were obviously developed and coded into the game. What happens after that still remains to be seen. You're pretending they don't exist just because they weren't introduced when many people expected them to be.
---
OK just found five in the bunker they seem to be bountiful I find them everywhere
---
But with or without Perks?  Because 100lbs of junk when I hold it might be 2x that if I put it in my stash.  
---
There have been a ton of inconsistencies where I'll see I'm out of space in my stash and because I have a perk on for holding junk, I'll take it all to my character, then put it back into the stash and miraculously I'm now 20lbs lighter.  Why?  I have no clue but then I'll also see weird stuff where now my max weight I can carry went up 50lbs.  So my Excavator armor now maxes out at 355.  huh?  This game has lotsa bugs. :(
---
Sound yes, but mostly have music playing through spotify instead of in game.
---
Distant thunder x4 today...x4 t-60 motion assist servos!!!  I shall prevail!
---
Yep.   It’s tedious.  And a grind.   Without compelling characters.
---
That said, the only saving grace for me is mate who tolerates the friend and helps me out with upgraded weapons and armor, and taking me into areas with high level enemies.  I wound them, he takes them down, I get lots of XP.
---
But it’s still mostly boring.
---
Just finished the Dreams beta.  Media Molecule knows how to run stable servers.  If I put my PS4 to sleep, on wake up, it reconnected in a handful of seconds.
---
Tedious
---
Bethesda was working on adding mothman themed stuff for the Atom store and changed the red tac lights by accident. 
---
depends.
---
Yeah, that’s the thing - there already are a bunch of NPCs, they’re just not human. Making Rose a human would change nothing about the game or her role. Making the mayor a real person, same. Why not just have humans, then? 
---
Oh wait. New Fallout 76 conspiracy alert: did they run out of time to do quests properly, so they decided to skip every human and turn the existing important quest NPCs into robots?
---
This is kind of how I feel after moving on to begin Kingdom Hearts.. Just about done with the first...
---
Haven't missed FO76, but will keep up on news in case good stuff comes along.
---
Latest inside the Vault was pathetic though 
---
Yeah, I played the beta then like a week after release and stopped for unrelated reasons. But it's pretty depressing that it's been this long and it sounds like it's on the decline. I had so much hope in Bethesda.
---
I love when the creatures fight each other.  
---
Owch yeah they drop those a lot still I have had good luck though perseverance is key! GL!
---
It honestly feels like they came up with the idea a few months before E3, slapped some stuff together for a trailer, and then released the game later in the year. I've spent time in game development, and Fallout 76 is what most games look like about a year or so before release. Solid foundation with very little actual substance and very buggy. 
---
And that's where I agree with you. They could have delayed the game until it was actually ready. Instead they released it as is. Why? Because the next generation of consoles are coming out next year so they needed to take advantage of their fanbase before then. I don't think they intentionally made a bad game or anything, but they had to have been well aware of the fact that the game itself needed a lot more work but released it anyway. Maybe the higher-ups rushed them. 
---
But yeah, no game should EVER be released in a state like this. The fact that the patches have progressively made the game worse (IMO, of course) says a lot about what's going on behind the scenes. They wanted to get away with a quick cash grab, and got absolutely destroyed by reviewers and the general gaming community as a result. 
---
Didn't work for me forever... Finally it did once 
---
Why are you still part of this sub? Must be hurting your life wasting your time on graphs.
---
Well, without the wider context of it being a bug, an account may simply be recognised as being in an area the player isn’t supposed to be. submitting a report would make the distinction between intentional exploitation and unintentional encounter, not so much asking to not be banned as it is clarification.
---
I'll take a set of T51(with everthing) so thats about 1300 caps?
---
And you expect people here to do something?
---
Yeah, I find some there most days too around all the communications desks and in the lobby. Good spot to grab tech data, too, for the BOS. My addiction is severe, need more! 
---
I’m on a mission to get you a t-60 Armor plan 😉
---
You'd be better off setting 3 20s on fire; at least it would be warm.
---
 I found Todd Howard's name in the game. if you go to the Grafton Steel Yard and find the chemistry bench in the rolling mill, on the perodic table on the wall, Todd howard has his name in fine print underneath the main title on the poster. 
---
Ah I thought it did lol i was using someones camp (floating camp btw) just to have it completely dissapear under me. Couldve been a glitch or he moved it at that time. I took it as it dissapears when you log out. Fuck me right lol
---
do u have all the resources for this? just making sure because some people don't read thoroughly.
---
This is totally reductive and ignores the vast difference between games with choice and games without. The major story beats are similar - more so once Bethesda got involved - but nobody ever played any of the previous fallout games the same way as anyone else. In Fallout 76, every single quest you do has been done the exact same way, following the exact same steps, by someone before you. That’s railroading, because there is zero option for choice other than the order in which you do the quests. That’s no choice at all, that’s just scheduling. 
---
For adrenal reaction? -50 max health. If you are running class freak it’s only -12
---
I do not give a fuck about “game economy.”  
---
It's much appreciated :) 
---
Which is fine, but when Todd Howard said at E3 that all their major studios are coming together to work on the project, we can't help but feel a bit mislead when it turns out that it was a sub-team doing most of the work. 
---
People call Unyielding sentinel for som e reason. 
---
thanks for your efforts. You have my upvote kind sir.
---
That's not bad I might look into getting that. Thanks for your help!
---
There is a honeypot for Nuka-Cola Quantum there.  There's a door on the rooftop that requires Lv. 3 Lockpick which takes you to an elevated area in the factory with a bunch of Quantum.
---
I feel like I've seen better locations for plain Nuka-Cola, but none of them come to mind.
---
Yeah no idea how many encounters I missed usually music was off in game, on the occasion that I decided to go intense multitasking music in one ear, movie in another ear and full game sound and music for background. I stumbled across mothman and flatwoods both times I noticed the sound before I spotted the mob. Although I do A LOT of “jogging” in game. I’m always moderately encumbered. 
---
Can't wait for factions. It'll come pre bugged so in combat you can't hurt other factions but can hurt your teammates. 
---
I can see a telescope on it but no space helmet. If you have an approach to get on there, I'd be much obliged!
---
I started in full PA, when I got the mask it auto removes the PA helmet. Just before the end of the round, I put my PA helmet back on to use the headlamp. The next round  started and it left the mask in my inventory and directed me to go pick up another mask. Hope that helps some.

I also have issues with servers crashing after taking workshops. I'm on PS4. It seriously feels like the servers literally are unable to handle when multiple workshops built up.
---
If you look at the way the special system is built, the only real option is pistols.
---
Shotguns and heavy won't work because they are strength weapons and you've already spent your points on melee.
---
Rifles technically could work, but they are perception weapons which is a useless stat for melee.
---
Pistols are in the agility tree, which is a good stat all all round and is very helpful for melee builds.
---
So a proper hybrid melee gun build would likely be a STR AGI LUCK set up, probably with some int for crafting perks. 
---
Why the fuck are you still posting here?
---
At least let us scrap for mods and stuff, perhaps.. 
---
That already happens 
---
Time to make a fanfic.
---
Can we declare 'shenanigans?'
---
Nope it has to be a player. When I played still if I saw someone with a bounty of 5 I'd go hunt them down, kill them and guard their loot until they got back so they had no bounty. I didn't want the caps or their junk. It's such a frustrating pain knowing that someone might just decide to come kill you for a pathetic 5 cap bounty and in the meantime you can't see anyone else on the map. The majority of those I killed realised what I was doing when their junk was still there after and gave a thumbs up. Great choices Bethesda! GREAT!
---
You can leave if you dont like free speech.

It's just a Vault-Tec super-reactor. [The asset's pulled from Fo4.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d1/FO4VW_Vault-Tec_Super-Reactor.png/revision/latest?cb=20170201191214)
---
Why did they take crippling limbs away from the enemies like the other titles? 
---
Incoming ban with blackmail email!
---
Bethesda might be too busy with the lawsuits on their hands though.
---
Let me see what I can do. But it looked doable from multiple approaches.. I’ll try with my vanilla character
---
Fair points. I think it comes down to whether this sort of game suits an individual player. 
---
Some people want to be at the center of a narrative, while others prefer to be carried by it. Some people like character interaction, while others like environmental storytelling. Some people like a game that pushes you into the stream of the plot, while others are okay with a game that says "stuff happened; feel free to take part if you're curious."
---
I've always liked FO (and ES) games because they're giant open world exploration games that also have a storyline. Sometimes, the storyline is very weak (FO4); other times, it's pretty strong (Morrowind). But what's great about these games is that the story always comes at your discretion; you can dive right in, or you can veer left after the opening cinematic, and spend your days just wandering the countryside and running into interesting bits and odd experiences.
---
76, for all of its many faults, still does this. And although a lot of people seem to think the story is weak, or doing quests for dead people is pointless, I found my experience quite different. I followed the Responder quest line because I wanted to know what happened (and later, because they had a cure they could give me); I followed the Free States quests because they had a good idea, and I *want* to make West Virginia safe, because it's where I'm going to live.
---
I guess my takeaway is "to each their own." The OP clearly didn't like the style of storytelling, but I disagree with the assertion that it was bad or did not provide sufficient "hook" to bring a player in, should they want to be pulled in.
---
My favourite "troll" moment I've ever had was when I was being escorted/had a body guard of some level 200+ in X-01 power armour that only spoke to me in only chicken clucks. Everytime I was in danger he'd cluck very loudly and then go punch the enemy in the face before it could hurt me. 
---
When it came time to part he just clucked extremely loud and then ran off into the distance clucking. Both weirdest and most amazing encounter I've had yet in the game.
---
Yepp! Most gamer friends I know sent a refund request  for this POS game.
---
Totally unacceptable.
---
I miss being able to choose where the dialogue in a conversation went with anything you talked with. I miss having certain perks that could allow you to take a creative route and try to lie or try to flirt or whatever with the character you were talking to. Like in FO3 or NV. I was disappointed when FO4 limited the dialogue choices, and knew it was foreshadowing. 
---
Found someone who duped those awhile back on PS4. Like....... why?
---
https://imgur.com/a/96gZhOw
---
I had the same at The Pumpkin House a couple days ago, wasn't aggro, just watching me, then i shot him and it was on. They are a lot easier to kill then I would have expected, and I'm not sporting a TSE or anything comparable, just a 1* Quad Tesla.
---
I've scrapped 100 suits and I haven't unlocked a single mod? What is there? 
---
I've missed that, will look now! There's a pretty reliable 2 Quantums in a level 2 locked cage right by the fusion generator downstairs I always grab.
---
Swapping in lockpick perks is such a drag with this character because I need the VATS and grenade cards in Perception by default. Usually I don't even bother, so I'm probably missing a lot of goodies.
---
Even if you and another person both have the same paint unlocked you can't trade.
---
good thing getting rad worms happens so infrequently :-)
---
Ahhh that makes more sense now. I'll try that tonight. Thankks
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about other armor, not the hazmat 
---
Level 73 70 ish hours played. Not playing anymore because it feels like the game doesnt want to reward me for doing anything. Once new stuff is out I'll check it out
---
Yup, just be aware it IS a risky play style if you run around that low, I’ve been one shot by high level Yao Guai a couple times
---
(Gonna be focusing on other weapons.)
---
On this sub, yes. 
---
Please explore some of the other fallout 76 subs and I hope you find a group you like. 
---
It gets worse the moment you cure rad worms it will remove all your mutations. 
---
P.S. Great picture, would make a cool wallpaper
---
I can't believe how entitled you think you are lol. 
---
This is reddit it's literally all people do here
---
Who is saying they are cracking down because they want people to grind more? It's an issue of server stability and the economy. I usually just give away my extra plans/recipes and so do most people I know. For the ones I want, like mutation serum recipes, it's hard to purchase them on the bazaar. 
---
I think the reason they don't let you sell ammo is because it would be an even stronger incentive to go full melee, which already has too much incentive.
---
That said, every player should have at least one melee weapon on them.  It saves ammo and, outside of sledges, many don't weigh that much.
---
For guns, Gunsmith and Weapon Artisan can reduce decay and allow you to "over-repair" a weapon to give it increased durability *and damage*.  The analog for armor is White Knight, which does both.  Between these, you should be able to get your decay rates under control.
---
Before I saw the price for buying them from players I was just taking the gamble every day by irradiating myself. I got lucky and managed to get basically all the mutations I wanted. I didn't want herd mentality and got lucky with a radaway removing that within 3 mutations. You can probably get the mutations you want for about 100 - 250c each. Don't pay more than that.
---
It's one of those words that is used wrongly so often that the wrong meaning is now fine.

Alternatively bubbles [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bubbles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bubbles) has atleast 1-3 every day.

Pre-ordered on PC. Level 15. About 20 hours played. It felt pointless. $60 down the toilet. I quit.

Sounds like r/Fo76filthycasuals would be the right sub for you.

right rule 9, the one that stops us from getting rid of dicks. Will remove the post
---
Risk vs reward 
---
lmao "unlimited Poway" I caught that
---
I'm a big time melee girl, but like you wanted a gun for SBQ fights. I never quite clicked with any gun...until I got my TSE Handmade. I stuck an automatic prime reciever on it ... Heaven. I run full melee in strength &amp; dedicate 9 pts to perception for Max auto rifle perks when the need arises. My other perks like Bloody Mess &amp; Adrenaline benefit both. My Axes do about 450 DMG &amp; the TSE about 200 I think. 
---
I loved the gun so much, I now have 2 TSE Auto Handmades (I leave one without the prime reciever so I can still use normal 556 on it). 
---
I never had a TSE before the nerf, so I dunno what I'm missing - but holy hell I love this gun. Keep an eye on Reddit, u can buy them for about 2-3k caps. WELL worth the money. 
---
I find myself using the gun more &amp; more - even in non SBQ times. I even kinda like blowing myself up 😂😂 
---
I really want to get it. and it's $35 right now. it's a hard decision/:
---
The simple fact of the matter is that none of the quest rewards compare with a 3\* Legendary.  But, you also aren't going to come across those very frequently, or in the combinations you want, unless you are a fan of grinding.  So, some players will just make do with the Blade of Bastet or Voice of Set.
---
I do think it was perhaps a deliberate challenge, since the Order is based on stealth and guile rather than raw strength.
---
lol - riiight.  It tells you that - I knew that, I didn't quite put 2 and 2 together,  thanks.
---
This isn't an official path to remove hackers. Follow the proper paths and good luck.
---
I can be a primary or secondary effect on armor. Just like poisoners, powered, cavalier, etc. 
---
This would be amazing and useful...so we already know Bethesda won't do it, an awesome idea nonetheless.
---
Honestly, I loved everything about the slocums cc in FO4, the power armour especially and I’d happily pay for ‘em (again)!
---

---
This happened to me and as a new player I didn't really know who's it was. Opened it, got 10 cap bounty whom a lvl 180 later collected lol.
---
You probably also have 10% of your camp budget taken up by the missing pet, I had a megasloth.
---
It's my decompression game too, really.  I just wish there were some new things to do.  The spontaneity of other players, events and vendor goods is good, but there are only so many goals you can formulate on your own.
---
Love the "accidentally thought it was a bug"! +1 mate 
---
You need a switch to change the power from on to off. If you power it directly from a power source, the door is always receiving power- thus its always on. You need yo interrupt that charge and a switch is the way to do it.
---
Yes! She usually has 4-6 for me most of the time, as well as one Grape that I always buy.
---
I've been seeing that as well, a reddish glow outlining everything I see and I don't have anything at all that does that.
---
Power goes to the blue box for the key pad to work.
---
I saw someone withe the black suit once.
---
YES. I thought that might be what that mysterious 10% was but hadn’t heard anything else about it.
---
It says “10% stored” so in my heart of hearts I hope somehow maybe we can one day find a way to bring them back from this elusive “stored” dimension.
---
Until then, my condolences. I hope somewhere they’re hanging out together being bros.
---
Who know what strangeness lurkes in the minds of Redditors...
---
All kidding aside I think that there is some disapproval of suggesting to changes for a particular play style when the already exist in-game mechanism that address it... But idk
---
Anyways, I may not agree with your suggestions, but I do appreciate that you shared them.
---
I feel ya. I got kicked off a server during a nuke. I needed one more raw flux to make a stable. Had to sell it off. Never mind that all the mob loot keeps taking 5 minutes to load so I didn’t have time to go get it. 
---
I have a rifle build (lever action) with a melee for when she lands, and I've done the SBQ several times. I don't have the complaints about it being a resource sink that the automatic users do. I shoot to cripple her wings and she lands and then I bash her to death. It makes it less sad if you miss out on looting her (empty fusion core slow-walk issue). It's not bad at all. 
---
Hahah so I just supposed mutations on my main with Rad-X, I forgot just how bad jumping is without Strange in Numbers + Marsupial! But, it’s totally doable- that roof that you said was too steep? Well, it sure wasn’t for me, just ran right over it. Is that enough info?
---
&gt; I used to only ever go to Whitesprings in Power Armor or a hazmat suit cuz a disconnect could almost always mean respawning into a freaking nuke zone and dying immediately. 
---
I used to only ever go to Whitesprings in Power Armor cuz a disconnect could almost always mean respawning while falling through the environment that hadn’t spawned yet and dying immediately when I eventually landed on the ground that finally spawned.

FTFY
---
That's poor game design then. It's basically heresy in game design to expect the player to server hop or, in this case, fast travel away and back just to avoid some form of griefing.
---
I want a collector stand for them, have since they first showed up in the series. I know there were mods for FO4 but I'm not a mod user.
---
I want them to focus on the bugs before adding content so I'm not whining about content.
---
I cant believe Beth thought they were entitled to 60$+microtransactions on an early access title.
---
That's how megacorps work, though. Sad reality. 
---
LMAO. Damn, ima be honest I’ve never had that one happen but it sounds brutal. 
---
Yeah I didn't realize that either when it released.  I just hung out around the watoga vendors until I found someone willing to shoot me.  
---
103 and time I'll never get back.
---
From the responses I've seen the resolution will likely be just removing the 10%, i don't mind as the pet kept attacking my friends and teammates. What I really want is to tame the cool little frogs and have them in my camp.
---
the devs at austin are lazy AF . makes me ashamed to even be from TEXAS
---
you did notice the ticket I have open right, or did you just read the title?
---
its not the dupers and they r no longer duping. If they were, u would see the community all flooded with assassin sentinel. However, considering dupers had the highest amounts of cap. They bought loads of stuff, monopolizing on the meta shift. While most of us were gearing up on TSE, they were already stacking up on the other stuff. Come the nerf, and they were ready to sell once again. Although this time, they couldn't use caps cuz most of their characters were maxed out on 25k caps. So they began to do trades only. 
---
That is when the $ hit the market, well it was there since tse, but who would be stupid to buy TSE stuff while everyone and their grandmother had one. Plus the dupers flooded top modded TSE weapons making their prices drop to whoever is willing to buy at whatever price. So players with massive loads of the good stuff began to sell their stuff for $, or trades that could be placed for $.
---
For example, i have caps and some really good stuff for sale. I am 100% sure those aren't going to get me any sentinel assassin gear. 
---
look at this way, u have players fully loaded cleaning up the market of any valuable item and reselling for $. So it isn't the duping that ruined the economy, it's the fact that the market has expanded to real life currency. While this is a norm for most online games, our market doesn't want the ingame currency, putting us buyers in a hard spot. Even with 15k caps, i can't find a decent offer to buy shit.
---
Targeting HUD causes a significant increase in game crashes. Unless that's your intention, to join the SBQ fights and make people crash, then have fun with that.

---
Ahh well, at least I got in on special. Would have bought on steam if it was on there and if it had as good a sale as Amazon.Au did a few days before launch. Save the plastic etc.
---
let me just leave this here... https://m.imgur.com/UpEndx2
---
So, I'd counter this by saying that it's not so much about Shotgun damage as much as it's about inflicting cripples.  At best, Enforcer has a 30% chance to outright cripple a limb.  That means, on average, it should only take 3-4 shots to cripple any limb you want, and that's far more efficient than the variants of this for other weapons (Tormentor, One Gun Army, etc).
---
For most enemies, just firing in the general direction of their legs is sufficient, particularly if you've got a Shotgun with a high capacity.  For things like Scorchbeasts, the wings count as limbs and can be crippled.  Whether or not they come down, though, depends on the situation.  It seems like if you are fighting them on rough or sloped terrain, they are less likely to land in general, as opposed to large, flat spaces.
---
Once an enemy is crippled, you can generally melee it to death without much problem.
---
I still play but I'm up to the point in the main quest where it's time to launch a nuke and I just have no desire to go through all that for the piddling rewards (and that being the end). So I guess I'm part of the no-nukes problem. 
---
I have only bought 2 outfits, Nuka Girl and Starlet Sniper, the rest just look lame. Almost forgot also  the Pirate Hat, Arrrh
---
Atomic Store gets regular content updates though. Keep an eye out for those limited time ones, you don't want to miss those.
---
rip
---
What vendor stocks those? 
---
And yet TSE was OP.
---
Its a fun mission. Im just saying that the weapons are not my exact weapon of choice. The All Rise is a quest weapon and it was 2*... 
---
The game does give weapons that are good. The All Rise isnt exactly overpowered, it is a good weapon though.
---
Try 2 or 3 days..

I've literally been giving them the formID of what's broken and in allot of cases, exactly what's should be there

---
&gt;Many of the complaints are completely unfounded and they've been fixing the legitimate problems at a decent rate.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;For example, the community complained about stash size, they upped stash size. Community complained about duping, they fixed duping. 
---
3 months in and the same issues from launch. Stash size was increased from a ridiculously tiny size to a slightly less tiny size, it's still nowhere near large enough. Duping was fixed and then broken again by patch 5. You can't even say they've fixed the scorchbeast attack thing as that is "in the future" like everything else. There is no sense of urgency for this and pretending they're fixing things "at a decent rate" is not going to help anyone. A decent rate would be within a month of reporting. Bugs on here have been known since Fallout 4. There is no excuse that excuses this mess.

XBox. 30 hours or so. Just broke lvl 30. My style is to prep, do a main line mission, and then walk and explore. I'll help a lower level frome time to time. And yes, since about lvl 15 I always leave excess ammo, food, chems and such at the Overseer's C.A.M.P and the Responder church or train stations. 
---
It's just another thing they didn't really think through.  I don't believe any other objective in the game is based on stealing from another player, but since they added ownership these supply drops, it's an aberration.
---
They really shouldn't have.  We should have more democratized loot, not less of it.
---
Imagine you had a rough work week... all you could think about all day Friday was getting home, settling in for the night, and getting to work on some new ideas you had on how to route power conduits through the brick wall so you wouldn’t have to deal with the ugly messy prospect of piping them through door ways or windows... so you’ve been brewing these awesome ideas all week and finally Friday night rolls around you are ready to put in some real serious CAMP building... you fire up the Bethesda launcher...and yet again it cleared your credentials even though you told it to save them the last time... fuck.. ok.. you put in your credentials and load up the game... you wait the usual minute or two watching load screens.... screen flashes... oh shit wtf... why am I falling.... Press X to respawn... WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK?!?!?
---
glitched item, players see it valuable as a collector's item.
---
Someone just wrote i want them to fix the bugs before content BUT the bugs are keep on repeating every single update and for what was the beta exactly? Was that comment serious? LOL
---
No, I’m just not seeing them as this insidious thing I need to harp on. Plus the code says they are for buffs, kind of like the weekly events that are occurring now? I don’t know man, just kind of sick of the constant bashing, especially when it’s undeserved.
---
I'm just grinding atoms for camp stuff, doing the challenges and every so often dropping nukes in strange places.
---
6 ton can chimes at top of the world and a few dumbbell weights all three silos have weight rooms just inside VTU in the fake vault and the motel in flawlessly will not you over 200 lead.
---
I just found the Flatwoods monster for the first time, yesterday at Whitesprings. Some of the robots turned purplish, and I had no idea what was going on until the monster showed up. Thank goodness only the affected robots were hostile instead of the whole gang, so I didn't have to switch servers.
---
Yeah, I was being very generous, I’ve seen the good work you report. 
---
What an elusive fella
---
I know what you mean.  My Perception is crowded with Rifleman and Concentrated Fire.  Having to swap in Lockpicking is very tedious.
---
My Endurance is worse though.  I ended up pulling points out of Endurance to get 3 in Charisma because I realized that Slow Metabolizer and Dromedary only matter when you actually eat or drink, and it is more effective to run around with Fireproof and Vaccinated instead.  But that also means that whenever I want to eat or drink most efficiently, I gotta switch the damn cards around again.
---
The trouble with messing with the legendary system is that right now, trying to find that perfect piece of loot is all the endgame there is. If people can get whatever they want crafted, what will they do once they're all kitted out?
---
I wrote one for mod misconduct allegations.  I am super proud of how well it turned out.  About 1000 words too!
---
Finishing perking out my build. I haven't been consistent in what I was aiming for, and had to move around alot of special points.
---
I don't think it's ever something I would "look forward to."  I'm just thankful they are less frequent and more predictable than the Defend Settlement quests in Fallout 4.
---
That said, yes, having multiple waves of the same enemy is silly.  If I proved I can take down the first wave, making me do it three more times - often the exact same setup - isn't accomplishing anything beyond wasting my time.
---
The loot in those is usually trash anyway and I don't normally bother with it
---
And btw every single "big" company like bethesda get their bugs fixed in some days. It just ridiculous.
---
Such an amazing Vault.
---
They also need to remove the auto PvP if someone takes a Workshop from you, that should be optional not something you have to be worried about a dickhead doing just to get more player kills for a challenge. I'd rather let a workshop go then enter PvP on a game that doesn't understand how PvP should work.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
A lot of work went into getting that axe to appear that way. 
---
Sentinel and Cavalier are always on  the third star.  
---
yeah grape is the most OP soda in the game, it acts like rad away but doesn't remove mutations.
---
Duping is pretty clearly cheating in an MMo. Blizzard banned people all the time for doing things like that. Actively abusing a bug for a advantage is rightly bannable.
---
I've had a few encounters with Mothman.  Almost killed him during his last visit.
---
Oh I'm sure it did but it's still crazy you can get it up to that damage. 
---
The market is now flooded with mutation serum recipes. I think that may have something to do with the new weight limit.
---
I'd be up for that, but with how the Atom shop is ran they'd probably sell each item individually instead of as one bundle. 
---
Do you look at the Perk Packs when they open, I've been getting nearly all doubles of maxed cards since around level 100, i now have level 1,2 and 3 of about 4 different cards.
---
Oh please, let’s not equate this with making a profit from selling items in the Developer Room.
---
Thank Bugthesda and their beautiful masterpiece of a program 
---
well, it happened before to Interplay.
---
It's a cycle.
---
Note there are mutiple types of powered doors. Not all of them even have the keypad. Keypad ones open when the code is put in if they have power. Non-keypad ones open if they have power.
---
You can buy them at the soda fountain in whitesprings for 30 caps apiece. I see them all over just randomly. I kinda wished I knew a consistent spot to tell you about.
---
Example being president trumps brother being in the board of directors at zenimax 
---
I just wish it didn't unequip all my armor. It'd save so much hassle if it just suppressed it the same way power armor does.
---
Fusion cores but of the handys and gutsys can use oil for gas, why couldn’t we use it to power vehicles?
---
End game? Hell, I cant even get through the slow of bots at the first part. I made it to the room once, never been able to get back. Even with turret help, me and 3 others couldn't make it. We went through combined over 1k rounds of ammo
---
Alright I have the keypad working, but how do I open the door from the other side? I tried connecting a power source to a switch, then connecting the switch to the box and it does nothing. 
---
no players bought the recipes with the loads of maxed out mules. They can craft it, so it isn't like rng produced loot.
---
I probably was that guy.
---
It could be your internet connection 
---
thx for the reply i will try supply drops too 
---
No problem!
---
That's great 
---
Wait, people r dumb to spend real money on this game's items?
---
Plz remember they used a very old version of the operating system (creation engine) lot of unused code.
---
I got it now, thank you!
---
Well it's not tough logic now, if you didn't call one,don't open it.
---
Don't worry, the fan boys will go back to sucking Bethesdas cock with glee at the first opportunity. 
---
Two characters. One 57. The other 59. PC. Still playing. A lot.
---
My most heartwarming moment was coming back to my camp to find someone left plans for ripper and few other goodies on my doormat. Never did i experience anything like that in any multiplayer game before.
---
I'm not talking about serums. I'm talking about the recipes. The recipes themselves are flooding the market. I know this -- I saw the prices from from 12k to 5K and less in about a week's time.
---
There are more serums because there are now far more people able to make them.
---
yep, just today i met a guy who bought a full set of sentinel assassin. He got it for 20$ lol.
---
I also slot Scrapper on the crafter, but man is it weak. I think it's giving me one single extra wood and one single extra steel on most break downs :(
---
Big fallout fan, I'm waiting for this fallout 1, 2 on PC from Bethesda that was supposed to be coming to 76 players.. but I love it. I could spend hours in 76 if I didn't have work or a family to hinder that. 
---
The bugs ive seen have been minimal. A few disconnects,  I cant get the hornwright mission-it instead gives me the mission to eat 25 year old hot dogs. I don't have the money to buy the extra atoms, the rum, the power armor helmet edition, so maybe the outrage and lawsuits come from that. But it's the idea that Bethesda, with its success in the past with skyrim, people have a preconceived notion that they're perfect, forgetting about ESO. 
---
Maybe people should enjoy its existence. Hey, its not perfect,  but it's not eso-esque and we can be thankful for that. 
---
they were probably duped b4 the nerf.
---
called in a government supply requisition at EM-B1-27 and it never came in. when trying to put in another it said I already had one in progress. 
---
It's about rebuilding the world for the people who come out of the vaults.  How do people keep missing this? 
---
It's the actual attack for the Snallygaster
---
You shouldn't be able to get it as an item - it's a bug 
---
praise be the Mothman!
---
I would, but I honestly do not know how to build something at someone else's C.A.M.P. Tell me and you got it. No need for gun. GT GrumpyDude 
---
Just curious but I'd like to know 
---
1. What level you are and
---
2. How long have you been playing?  
---
For a very long time, it's easy to tell yourself that the game is a grind and you gotta focus on the long- term. You won't have all the best gear in a matter of hours.  It takes time.. 
---
Then around level level 100, you kill the scorch beast queen for the 15th time, telling yourself this is it. She has to drop my Ultracite calibrated shocks this time. 
---
But she doesn't.  She drops explosive vents... again.
---
Or you kill a difficult three star legendary in a difficult section of the map and you are rewarded with a level 40 wooden chest piece, for at least the 50th time. 
---
The game starts to look a lot different.
---
I'd prefer both myself. I've played NV so I know sometimes you want to see individual weights too (especially when we're so used to it that way).
---
Pretty cool stuff straight up!
---
He didn't disappear he ran away. I've noticed that legendaries will flee which makes zero sense. 
---
You killing critters that are less than lvl 45 or 50+? Critter level plays a role in max level gear that can spawn
---
We looked everywhere, even outside and roof.
---
Duping is back. What has changed is the weight limit for characters. It doesn't make sense to dupe armor when you can only carry 1.5k when you can make just as much per recipe and dupe far more of them.
---
The market was completely flooded over the past couple of weeks. That is, since the weight limit of characters was changed. 
---
No argument here.  I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided that the aggressor should get to unilaterally instigate PvP at Workshop.  It seems pretty obvious to me that if the aggressor decides to take your Workshop, then you have a choice.  Either you can drop pacifist and fight back, or you can let it go.  The way it is now, where they get free rein to kill you just for showing up, is bizarre.
---
Check your launcher, I've had mine since Christmas day. 
---
You have to attach in this order. Generator to switch switch to door. Door cannot be connected to generator or any generator linked wires except the switch.
---
Can you say the communication is terrible if there isn't any?
---
Same - usually after fast travelling and I also have Adrenal Reaction - XBox
---
it's been out for awhile now 
---
Mothman! He’s my favourite part of the game. So wise. So beneficent. 
---
Uranium fever?   
---
It's caped at 35 to 40, some events are the  same 
---
It's actually pretty easy, all you have to do is be on my team.
---
I will add you, my GT is RaBD Xeno
---
" Yes, I know FO76 is not an MMO " As far as patch notes are concerned I think it should be treated like one. I'd actually say that comprehensive patch notes for FO76 are more important because it's a shooter and not a "sit there and do my skill rotations" MMO. 
---
Any changes to weapon damage or perks have a far more tangible effect on the player than a small percentage nerf on certain skills in a MMO. Weapons in FO76 can go from "merely okay if you're perked for them" to "completely useless now". Activities like maintaining control of a workshop can go from getting a decent amount of resources to barely getting any.
---
Even if I played on console ? I just download the launcher and log-in with my Beth' account ?
---
They have a route they travel in the zones they spawn. Their radius couldn't be more than 100 or so. If they do run, try hiding and waiting until they come back. Works for me
---
I built a wonderful brick house. It’s a shame my garage door is attached with aluminum fail walls. I’d also like textures for each building material.
---
Wuts so special about sentinel assassin armor,
---
i wouldn't know honestly, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I couldn't give 2 shits about them. But if they are back at it. We will have a shit show soon in the market.
---
One time I got three SB. I dunno if I should look forward to them. 
---
What I did was adopt the story and become part or it. When I ran into newbie in the basement od thr mansion for the Mistress of Mysteries, Id take them to the locations and explain what was on the terminald if they didnt want to read it, it was like I was training a new agent. I did the same for a lot of the game.
---
The past couple of months that hasnt happen because new players are so far inbetween, but when I do find one I try to hook them up with a crafted weapon, a power armor framr and some cores so they can loot more. 
---
If there was a bunxh of mew pmayers it would be fun yo be a responder or raider and play in the game's environment, but instead we get shitty patches that fix thibgs no one asks for amd breaks new things in the process. 
---
I generally don't pay attention but I just killed a 3* legendary mole Miner who dropped a 2* level 40 furious Gatling gun and the other week I had a level 35 instigating lever rifle drop.
---
The last 2 times I've had a 3* level 50 drop it's been a Stalkers melee each time. Either I get ridiculous perks on a melee weapon or when I get something decent it drops as an under leveled piece.
---
Leave it to Bethesda to break everything, even definitions.
---
Train yard near Watoga.
---
Oh, I'm well aware that the possibility of being just asset reuse is very high. ^_^ Still fun to investigate, though! =]]]
---
Youtubers claimed and showed proof that loot boxes were hidden in the unused assets of 76. They never falsely claimed they were buyable in the game just to smear Bethesda, they were just documenting how close to that line the developers got with what evidence they could find. Where is the BS?  
---
Man, that's stupid. 
---
Surely by now they have gotten feeback on this. 
---
Really, I think the person replying was just misinformed. 
---
Thats how it works 
---
I know the feeling. Every time I've legendary farmed with a buddy of mine this past week, I've gotten crap, if anything, and he's been scoring ridiculous good stuff.
---
I enjoy it myself been playing since New Vegas. My main gripe next to shit servers is trying to bring up my weapon wheel during battles, just seems unresposive at times and i automatically will press right to scroll throygh my weapons so in the heat of battle if i dont press up hard enough or am in 1st person and my chars still in animation it wony come up then i end up wasting stimpacks because press right on d-pad is autostim. I wish they would add a feature to reareange the d-pad settings or choose what we want on it. 
---
Here's the thing -- the economy is destroyed. Many people have 25k caps on 5 characters so they cannot sell things for caps without buying another account. So god weapons are being traded for other god weapons. 
---
Bethesda not addressing this immediately, and letting weeks go in december with out-of-control duping did so much damage I'm not sure what can be done to recover.
---
Wow that picture of the Overseer's office looks like it's from found footage or something. Spooky 
---
Open up some areas to being CAMPable, persistence (if possible) of stuff like workshops.
---
I believe the BOS vendor bot now carries all T-series PA plans... might cost you up to 5k in caps though.
---
You know your game is in disarray and your moderation is terrible when the comminuty has to beg to not be banned for experiencing a glitch.
---
Do you want us to say yes? That's what it feels like you want us to say
---
Ok
---
5 pieces means u aint dying from anything while standing. Stupid broken math. Sentinel is 15% damage mitigated. 5 pieces would give u 75% damage mitigated. Plus 8% from assassin on 5 pieces which is 40%. So total damaged mitigated is 115%. That's broken af lol. 
---
Same here. I maxed Shotgunner and Rifleman. Then "Expert" Shotgunner and "Expert" Rifleman. Now when I open a new pack the 1 star Shotgunner and Rifleman are given as choices again. The maxed out cards are in my stats and show "Max Level". I've wondered if they just didn't provide enough upgrade star spaces to fill. I'd try taking another card that I'm already maxed at, but don't want to waste a pick. 
---
Yeah, I had 2 legendary super mutants in one area and after being shot, both ran away and I had to chase them down.
---
Huh. IDK, shit story arc with almost no effort put into it?
---
Almost as much effort as a shitty forum post from a troll. 
---
Well, sure they did. But now its impossible to retract, cuz they are now systematically vendoring with the community. The damage is done, we got to put up with it now lol.
---
No there's literally enemies that have no rendering on our end so you just grunt and get that blood  screen until you die. I've been killed a few times by an invisible enemy. I don't mean I can't see him shoot me, it's something definitely just smacked my character in the face like 5 times. Then you'll run by a sentry bot and see them lighting up the air in front of you
---
Yep.
---
Screw you, I'll never give up my Golden .44
---
&gt;If there was a bunxh of mew pmayers it would be fun yo be a responder or raider and play in the game's environment, but instead we get shitty patches that fix thibgs no one asks for amd breaks new things in the process. 
---
What....????
---
No they don't, that's a ridiculous thing to say. Buy a clue.
---
Take fireproof if you can, they'll tickle after that.
---
Well thought out post with effort put into it makes me a troll because I have a view you don't share??? 
---
I know it sucks but just accept that you were fleeced and move on. They pushed out a shitty, unfinished product and lied about it all the way. Be more skeptical in the future and never pre-order.
---
Yep. I don't think it can be fixed. I thought for awhile a complete wipe may work, but now I think they'd lose more people than gain if they did.
---
Flaws wouldn't exist if they finished the game...
---
Thanks, I ran twice and saw only one legendary inside and one outside. Seems to be rather low but I guess experience isn't that bad considering the high density of Super Mutants.
---
I agree! I have ready been enjoying the game. The only issue I have encountered that really bothers me is I get about one disconnection per play session (I usually play about 2 hours at a time, on Xbox One). I am getting close to 200 hours in, and I am starting to feel the boredom set in a bit. I am starting to feel like I have done everything, and am getting to the point where I mostly only log on daily to farm a few things and make my vendor runs. I only play solo, so I am sure I am missing out on some multiplayer fun that would add to the game. I would love new content, but I definitely feel like I got my $40 worth and more. If I would have paid $60 for the game, I would still have been very happy with the 150+ hours of very fun gaming time. No, I don't feel that it is a masterpiece, but I like it a lot. I don't understand all the hate, but everyone is free to their opinion.
---
Guh, some person tried to sell me a white dirty outfit for 6k caps.  Good to know!
---
Reactive plates reflect 50% melee damage try it out its a power armor chest mod it basically mutually assured destruction for the 20 HP melee builds
---
Dirty is worthless colors are priceless better way to put it 
---
I’m in the same boat. I think this game has/had great potential but many of the changes being made by Beth just seem to make the game more tedious. 
---
I log in, I take over a workshop or two and it’s a constant nuisance. Why is it being attacked this damn often and why did I bother building turrets. They’re more of an enemy locating device than anything. 
---
I would like to try new guns or mods for my PA but the cost/time investment involved is astronomical. 3-5000 caps when you can only make a maximum of 1200/day. So what, 3 days per mod? Crazy. 
---
It’s hard to stay invested in a game that isn’t paying off.
---
And scorch beasts... you’re the worst.
---
well.... I don't know what you mean. black powder only had one mod....
---
I didn't actually lose them, if I server hop it will go to normal sometimes.
---
You can choose between a new perk or you can move a point per level up. You don't get more points though.
---
They had their chance, but the whole thing was dealt with so poorly. They just banned Youtubers cyz they has visuals on them and those with stupid amounts of items. Although the major dupers walked out of it without a scratch, plus loads of time to react. Before the ban hammer swung, those dupers that got away had enough time to drop excessive amounts of items. Bethesda could have caught and banned them all in one go. Rather than to crack down on a few Youtubers and allowing the rest to sort themselves out. I saw loads if dupers dropping crazy amounts before the bans hit.
---
poor execution let them slip through the cracks. As a result. We have a f 
---
Then bad luck, robots can spawn in from 14 to 52 (as I've  seen them)   
---
Mole Miner level caps at 40, even in a nuke zone
---
40 is the max level for Mole Miners. It's why you don't do Uranium Fever if you want max level legendaries.
---
I was kinda sad when they added a golden .44 skin and it was only for the weakest of the three types of .44 revolvers, not the single-action or western. A lot of players bought it without knowing and couldn't use it.
---
I did have the luck of finding a good-enough legendary walking cane for the candy cane skin.
---
I did but it’s impossible because I’ve not opened a pack since Wednesday :(
---
Yeah and Bethesda expects people to be fine with it apparently. I've made many complaints about this issue and all of them have gone ignored. I will not be wasting my time with a 3rd character to grind to level 100, especially after the XP nerf. I played solo because none of my friends would buy it and with how Bethesda treats the people who actually go out of their way for these trophies, I'm not in the least surprised. Fallout 76 will be the last Bethesda game I ever buy unless I see some actual improvement.
---
Well, the Assassin's effect only influences damage from other players, so isn't that only useful in PVP?
---
&gt;I've killed players in ultracite armor around lv 100.
---
anyone can do it, PA is completely useless in pvp. don't take the fact you oneshot an ultacite as an indicator of anything.
---
&gt;I've built up my defences to withstand a suped up Super sledge.
---
unless you have % damage reduction from legendary armor, a 30K hit from a Power Fist **is** going to down you. and even if you do, the guaranteed stagger will get the job done.
---
&gt;TSE sucks always have. It's a suicide gun. Anti-armor is superior.
---
tell that to my Assassin.
---
&gt;Terribly sorry I just destroyed your viewpoint of the game.
---
not at all. you clearly don't have enough experience with pvp.
---
BoS is your favorite, eh?
---
my guy is a former vault security officer,  his high charisma and intelligence gives him and his team a lot of bonuses for their squad (lots of party perks)
---
now at lvl 45 his built a bar to give a beacon back to his former friends in the vault , so he drinks and patrols the outskirts of Charleston 
---
This is the universe telling you to save your money bro, I tried to stick with it, and failed.
---
Sounds like more proof it's going free-to-play to me.
---
the 75% in pve is still god tier. no enemy can touch you. Your damage resistance alone already makes their hits like wet noodles. Take 75% out if that lol
---
Keep in mind a pvp server is releasing soon. I play alot of pvp. A sentinel assassin player would swallow loads of your ammo. My bloodied lever action rifle can go upto 650 per shot. Today i fought a guy that took a full clip of 5 shots. 3 on the head... While I normally 1 shot players, i roughly knocked off a quarter of his health. 
---
It's an older codesir , but it checks out.
---
I was going to offer you materials.   But then I noticed your screen name and laughed at the notion of you calling “us” shady.  
---
Now it is.
---
 What platform? I never accept random team invites for this reason. If Ibget one, I usually fast travel to somewhere near the person and find them then they usually try to attack me. It's almost always a griefing attempt.
---
Because the Overseer was Native American?
---
I agree with you. I’ve played nearly daily since beta. I keep it fresh by leveling new toons with different specs. I kind of lose interest when I hit about level 65 and it’s all just more grinding, so I start over and try to experience things differently. It’s worked so far. This means I don’t have any toons decked out in 3-star legendaries, but what the hell, it keeps me entertained.
---
Hope I'll be able to get the jumpsuit. Hated that I couldn't get the VTU one.
---
😂
---
I oxyclean my wings with cocaine
---
Would posting his name here help others in the future?  Or am I going to get grief from the trolls for actually having some honor when I play?
---
LOL I meant more like the Seinfeld 'gold' but that works too!
---
takes 5 random pieces of unyielding and a bloodied melee, preferably a fist, which aren't hard to get at all. anything-explosive is multiple times harder to roll.
---
even without it, just stack a meat hook with adrenal reaction, talons, twisted muscles, radicool and party boy/girl since melee scales with str and 26 + iron fist and gladiator is enough to kill most people.
---
Wow thats op
---
Yeah the chicks at point pleasants are known to have a weird tendency to buzz around
---
This I do not know.  You'd have to look into the game files, and that's beyond my knowledge to parse.
---
I got the tricentenial addition at full price, $35 is a better price for sure, I play it when I can, just walking around the wilderness, there is a lot of attention to detail regarding the writing and locations, just buggy sometimes, I don’t have a lot of bad luck with the bug aspect
---
If this happens the asinine immediate defense mission after you initially capture a workshop needs to go away. It's already dumb as hell and annoying to hunt down all the enemies in a workshop to claim it, only to immediately have to fight off even more enemies before you even have a chance to build up any defenses. 
---
Yep, stopped playing FO76 and went back to FONV a little under 2 months ago now. Still come to the reddit just to check out what's going on... Seems like Bethesda's buggy, unfinished games are finally biting them in the ass. I stopped having faith that they would fix their game since then too. These patch notes are not exactly what people wanted to get when we were complaining. 2 shot nerf? XP nerf? 
---
Still doing the SBQ but it's getting a bit easy. Also filling out my PA mod plan collection and farming armor plans from world spawns.
---
But yeah, game needs content.
---
Vault 94 isn’t complete, none of them are.  I say that having explored them all several times, but it is the one closest to completion.
---
Also, have you and your friend noticed what I’ve discovered?  Namely that each vault is lazy design and represents an “elemental” approach.
---
Earth - Vault 94
---
Water/Ice - Vault 96
---
Fire - Vault 63 
---
A friend and I had my C.A.M.P. set up on the road near somewhere I can't remember the name of now, (We stopped playing a while back) and we called in a supply drop. It spawns at the location we live near, when we get to the drop, who else is there but the Flatwoods monster, glitched into a puddle in the road. We take a few pictures, loot the drop, and murder it while it watches helplessly.
---
They can’t really hand out vans to everyone who gets into a place like this because it can happen by accident and they know it. You’d have to do it multiple times.
---
I’ve seen that a few times today also.    Always in my excavator armor.  Wondered if part of the weight bug.  
---
The inaccessible door, from memory, is an elevator shaft leading to a lower floor, connecting to a bathroom I believe.
---
At this point I just assume that the vast majority of people who use reddit have extreme bipolar disorder as well as a rather stressful life and therefor are constantly doing weird and illogical shit.
---
Different emotes. Not like the current ones where it's mainly a different icon. Actually different, like dances, saluting, heroic poses, that kind of stuff.
---
What does my name have to do with it? I’m overly generous with almost everyone I encounter, hook people up with weapons, plans etc every chance I get. Always drop extra stuff in the train stations so people can find it, and always offer to help lower level players if they are struggling.... 
---
I had to right click and open each page in a new tab.. Jesus lol. Got it though.
---
Sure buddy. ,
---
Workshops themselves have become pretty useless since nerfs the only benefit is owning the ones giving lead and /or fusion cores.
---
I also appreciate your suggestion. Defending and holding a workshop should be more rewarding 
---
That'll be 8000 atoms, sir
---
Well, I'll try just like you. If I fail is well I'll tell you haha.
---
Already if anyone can get in the games file see what you can find like if there's like any lines of code that have anything related to the vault let everyone know
---
People are still trying to spread this lie, huh?
---
This is some good r/filthycasuals content
---
I've heard of a few other people saying this. I once recieved 58 stimpaks as basic mission reward. So I guess this isn't to strange 
---
I went to help a couple of guys with a silo recently because they were taking ages. Turns out that if you take too long, the robot spawn rate ramps up to the point that it's tough to kill them fast enough. Speed things up a bit and you can cruise through.
---
This is the craziest thing I've had happen.
---
This sounds pretty fun, there would just need to be enough people online to do it
---
&gt;  the one way you can actually help other people in game they kill that dead
---
It's clear they don't want people helping each other, so it's a failed battle royale.
---
Just last week, the Unstoppables promo gave +15HP for every unique outfit in your team. It was only temporary, and not substantial, but they've already violated "cosmetic only" in my eyes.
---
I logged out far away from my base where the ore deposits are, logged back in, went back to base and found the deposits full. It seems if I log out next to them, they do not come back when I log back in.
---
Jesus.
---
Yup. I got disconnected right around the time of this post. Just finished setting up Grafton Steel. Again. Ugh. 
---
Siege weapons. Ones that require decent resource investment to make. That could be a good countervailing game system. 
---
Why would Bethesda ban somebody for something that happened due to Bethesda's broken game????  
---
Will I get banned for all of the time's I've spawned in foundation of my C.A.M.P. like a scene from the Philadelphia Experiment?
---
Was it a prerecorded sound or him making actual clucking noises.   
---
Yeah but a bad bug to run across though one guy said a couple weeks back he scored 8 legendaries off of one. He also stated that he died a few times before he finally killed the ghoul. Maybe that had something to do with it 
---
Worst decision you could have made
---
Its not that my mutations don't work it only removes the positive effects and leaves the negatives
---
Maybe that’s the benefit to the severs beings so small and unstable, I’m pretty unlikely to randomly encounter them again. Blocking is pointless, and sending someone a message about what a jerk they are is just gonna make them laugh at you harder 
---
Oh I got you 
---
Always happens to me 
---
It violates the anti-witch hunting rule. Plus we dont have evidence, and even if we did we cant turn into an angry mob.
---
I also received a ridiculous number of stimpacks as a mission reward once, can’t remember which one but it was nice. I can live with these kinds of glitches
---
I did not die at all prior to this happening. I was just doing laps at springs on a server that seemed pretty laid back to power level my alternate character. I had 6 3* in total on one of my laps around springs, that never happens either. What is crazy was of those 4 pieces had 2* and the other had 3*. I signed off as that is all my luck for the next week.
---
LOL good point :)
---
In fact, though it isn't your intent, your comment made me realize I don't want to sub to /r/fo76 anymore. DONE im unsubbed from this place!
---
We all can!
---
Are you suffering withdrawal?
---
I don’t like the idea of not being able to get legendaries from enemies at all. I think a mix would be acceptable, like having 1 stars able to be dropped from legendary enemies and from there they can be upgraded by legendary mods that can be crafted or dropped. But being able to turn any weapon into a legendary would be too much.
---
The loot system right now is completely bugged out and not working as intended by the way. If you kill everything at the whitesprings golf club you get a 1 Star legendary on about half the ghouls there, even if they aren’t legendary ghouls.
---
Yeah exactly lol keep the good glitches get rid of the bad ones 
---
Same. Or the bright blue suitcases at Watoga or Pleasant Valley (where seemingly everyone has their camp).
---
Maybe by posting their name others can avoid them?
---
Its a reference to the 666 number of the beast.
---
The only thing i could think of when he stated he died multiple times is that the game was "reloading" the ghouls inventory.. But sense you didn't I'm not really sure. Shit I could use some luck like that 
---
Yes, but that has nothing to do with my point. Prior to Fallout 3, they were assholes too. After Fallout 3 they went back to it.
---
Do you honestly think what you are doing is role playing as a raider? It would be pretty cool to do that but the game is just not set up that way, there is no way to “raid” when all you can really get off of another player is maybe a few junk components. Wow. 
---
Get real dude, you just have emotional problems  
---
Dought it. Overseer could be
---
ahh maybe..but its not listed in effects..how do i cure that?
---
Classic response from someone who knows they just got verbally fucked up. Unless you have a disability or have extremely little experience typing, it would take less than 5 minutes to type out what he did.
---
Or just nuke it yourself instead of waiting for someone else to...
---
Me too. All day it’s been awful 
---
It’s simply not that deep. 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
---
10/10 post
---
He started typing walls of text at me within like 5 mins of me posting the thread. Like holy shit, I stirred the hornets nest here. But nice addition to the conversation, shithead.
---
I can't speak for the PS4, but since the PC has a similar freeze, what I basically do is end every game back at my CAMP.  When I resume my game, I spawn next to my CAMP and only start doing things once my CAMP has fully loaded in.  If I try to do anything before then, I get the freeze until the CAMP shows up.  If they two things aren't related, then the CAMP at least is a good indicator of when it's safe to proceed.
---
Will you guys fix the bug where the daily quest "Heart of the Enemy" is not repeatable daily? 
---
I think if you press any buttons or open pip boy too soon before everything loads in
---
Happens to me, I can walk but I can't access my pip boy or I have a full crash. Enemies are there but I can't see them. I just walk slowly straight away and try not to jump or anything. It all loads in after a min. Big thing is DONT touch your pip boy. Just let it all load in. 
---
I don't care if its a baby or not i want a pet moth man
---
Level 109, 325 hours. 
---
Just barely started joining SBQ fights and still haven't bothered to figure out nukes. Kind of unfortunate as the last patch seems to have made so many folks quit that I'm lucky to find any server where nukes are launched.
---
That's the new survival mode.
---
One of my fav pastimes 😍
---
Would explain why i have a bunch of heavy perks on and its still crap
---
Or wait for people to die at the queen and loot the corpse 
---
he couldn’t have killed you at any time unless you shot at him first and the player marker not facing the correct way is constant, it’s not a bug that happens sometimes. Pretty sure it was in the other games as well.
---
Sounds like this guy was either using a stealth boy or had the chameleon mutation and was standing still when you looked at him.
---
Yes exactly! Although I’ve been giving it 5 minutes before I touch my remote to see if it helps and it’s stayed froze! Maybe it’s just something that can’t be helped sometimes? 
---
I had that happen while simultaneously all my mutations stopped working. This new found perk wasn't worth losing marsupial.
---
How about your workshop stuff gets blueprints for the next time
---
Yeah it just seems to crash and after that happens even when you wait for a while before pressing anything it still happens :( 
---
I liked that guys CAMP idea. 
---
Nice!  I also encountered some docile monsters today.  I had a sweet photo shoot with a mirelurk king at the freakshow location. And also sat with a frozen-in-place mongrel dog and took a few pics at the Hornwright summer villa (I think that's what it was called)
---
Maybe some monsters were taking the day off today. 
---
Don't knock Watoga life. Two shopkeepers, plenty of Comic Books, ease of access to Scorched Queen and Fort Defiance. My Mutation Shop if right outside Watoga. :)
---
No it isn’t. Trolling doesn’t have to be malicious. Trolling is messing with someone. You’re the one with who’s got it wrong buddy.
---
Yeah I’ll try that! Sometimes I’ve joined my server and it’s said my camp needs to be replaced but can be places for free so maybe that will kill 2 birds with one stone if I do that! Thanks! 
---
Why wait when you can just pick fights after they get their rewards :p
---
yeh addictol didnt fix my stats..now my charisma is down to 1 😢
---
Me too, going to try it! 
---
Why fignt when you can ascend and eat there corpse and flowers all together 
---
If your on PS4 I can fully mod out a Gatling for you. Even with the prime receiver
---
You wait until you see your weapon raised and your health and stats load in and see your character? I never have a problem when I just wait it out.
---
Right, you’re just shallow. 
---
"Complete BS" isn't the same as "Mostly implemented, at launch, further changed afterwords, but yet unused".
---
They're not used. Some of the things expected to be from them are being used in events. That's great. Here's hoping they stay that way.
---
You quote Pete Hines saying this vindicates him, how about Todd Howard saying "It just works?"
---
There will come a point where you realize that the the aspects of the game you enjoy don't have any weight, or don't actually work the way you thought they did (they may not work at all, or not have any of the depth you thought they did). 
---
You may hit very large bugs, or just run into so many small ones that it ruins the experience for you. 
---
I truly hope you keep enjoying the game and this never occurs for you. 
---
Gotcha, I'm gonna try this out later tonight. Thank you so much!
---
sorry I am on xbox.
---
Why don't they just add the rare human NPC? It's like they wanted us all to role-play or something. Instead it's just a wave and a thumbs up and run off. Even if it's just some AI that helps you out like the mysterious stranger or something.
---
Don't waste your time or money.
---
Harper's Ferry is surprisingly good as a one-shot violet flux run. Kill stuff in the middle for the mass &amp; fluids, then run around the outside and pick up the strangler pods and ferns. I got something like 70 raw flux in one run, plus a bunch of multi-star trash legendaries.
---
what was the point of buying it then ? 
---
Not gonna happen. They don't listen to suggestions or requests. I play the game and i know it wont happen.
---
Not sure what the deal but today it’s been exceptionally worse than normal. I still haven’t been able to kill the SBQ because of disconnects but even chilling at my CAMP I’m getting booted. Got booted just loading in a couple times today. 
---
Because I love Fallout. 
---
Just exploring is fun, avoiding pvp is extremely easy. Firstly off another player can only do a very tiny amount of damage to you until you hit them back and if they keep bugging you just block them for the session (it removes you from their map and other things) 
---
You will need to build but a small shack with the basic building stations and a stash but that’s all.
---
From my experience most players don’t care about pvp even in nuke zones. You’re more likely to find people wanting to explore with you and maybe even give you stuff for free
---
Can it be any more broken?
---
Just wait for the next "patch". 
---
Pretty sure they'll roll back any previous fixes and stealth nerf anything useful. 
---
I think he has a point.  They're not necessarily trying to role play at all, just having some fun in whatever way they can.  The game has been out long enough that many people have nothing left to do, so if they play it's to do whatever keeps them interested.  For some, that's griefing, and there's really nothing deep about the reasoning.  They're just assholes.
---
Launch a nuke is too stressful for me. I successfully launched once, but all those robotic voice announcement made me crazy.
---
Ah why waste time typing. You must be a real winner in rl
---
This seems fake 
---
I got mine from defending Hemlock holes, and another from the Dirt track, try those?
---
Nope. In fact, I'm getting ready to play it in just a few minutes.
---
Thanks! Will do. 
---
That makes me really sad. I always called a couple when I visited Flatwoods so newbies get some funboxes. :(
---
Your account as been flagged and you get put on the bad servers.
---
Literally it’s every 30 minutes. Also I have been frozen at least 10 times also. 
---
Im pretty sure he just read the magazine. It adds one to the UI
---
It's a great game when played like a hiking simulator for 30 minutes at a time.
---
lol have Karma I chuckled
---
Chaotic Good
---
It would also be good to be able to tag particular weapons we're carrying so that we're asked for confirmation before they're scrapped.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who's accidentally scrapped a favourite one when getting rid of a lot away from our CAMPs. 
---
I think he means he hopes it'll be in the atom store again at some point in the future.
---
Something was trying to protect you
---
I actually think I got trolled one night by those two..  
---
Kept having wave armies of Molerats and scorched attacking me,  those guys ;)
---
Content expansion. Good joke.
---
It’s a PvE game pretending to be a PvP game 
---
Finally, with the owl mask, the Mothman Cult can BECOME the Mothmen.
---
Well I sure didn’t read the magazine and I’ve seen it a few times.  Maybe a mutation?? Would have to be a bad one.  I walk around with the damn things all the time.  
---
*Jingle Jangles Aggresively*
---
Not op.
---
Are you a sociologist?
---
maddragon how much would u cost to do that?
---
I get that. Maybe move on to another game then? GTA online is the perfect place for someone like that, go there. I don’t get why fucking it up for everyone else is the endgame people choose. I’m on my second character now, I’ve probably put in just as many hours as this guy but I’ve put my energy into helping other people and it’s been a lot more fun and rewarding than pulling some weird shady camp trashing moves 
---
160 raw violet at the prime site today 😍
---
Get a shotgun. Get Enforcer.
---
**First:**
---
Props for the Raider PA... I'm like the only Person on the PC side of things I've seen in it past 75... 
---
**Second:**  
---
Never, in hundreds and hundreds of hours, if you didn't have a video I would have though someone was pulling your leg and "planted" some on the corpse
---
Oh yeah, 100% 
---
They never should have even bothered with the pvp aspect
---
No, but it does get a speed boost from Martial Artist.
---
That gun makes no sense. It's a melee (perk above) pistol (atom challenge) heavy gun (damage perks apply).
---
Have you ever noticed you seem to get downvoted a lot?
---
So overall yeah the games not in the best place, but that mainly lies with the end gamer players being upset at the state of the game currently so it would take you some time to still get to that point.  Most of what the current gripes are is a recent slew of nerfs designed for the sole purpose of curbing those using exploits in the game, which caused massive server instability.
---
There's a passive mode built into the game so unless you are either 1. Wanted 2. Listening to a specific pvp channel (hunter/hunted) 3. Triggering a pvp event to try to farm materials or 4. Shooting/hitting a player either unintentional or intentional.  
---
Honestly you're extremely limited to what you can build with to begin with so I wouldn't worry too much there.  The space you get is smaller than the red rocket workspace in fallout 4 and the build limit is enough (for me anyways at level 60) for a medium shack, workbenches, some turrets and crops.  
---
I'm not 100% sure how leveling works when you are grouped up.  To my understanding it is supposed to be leveled to the highest level in the party.  But I have also seen cases of enemies spawning (and me going into certain areas) where the enemies that spawn were nowhere near my level, on both the high and low end of that spectrum.  
---
Overall I would personally suggest you wait a little bit.  While it's debatable about the state of the game, and who's to blame for that matter.  But the game is player driven which as I said briefly won't really affect you much except when you get towards the end game content (which right now is also lacking in truth)
---
Thank you for your initiative to do this.
---
Me too, about 4 times in 4 hours. Always when I had taken workshops 
---
When you place a door in a door frame, you can rotate it so the it opens from the left or right.
---
I want one in my camp.
---
What are they doing? I legit can't understand how a game can be handled so poorly by anyone, let alone a big company. It just doesn't make sense. They add bugs and then just leave them for weeks at a time. I'm so confused by this.
---
The enclave office uniform and hat does \*not\* count towards the formal wear event challenge.
---
Its gold, Jerry! Gold!
---
Yeah it is. There is a good reason for that.
---
The game is a burning garbage pit.
---
This game is actually worse now than when it was launched. So much is broken. So much is poorly designed. 
---
The devs are so fucking tone deaf that they ask for feedback, and when it isn't what they want to hear they stick thier fingers in thier ears, and go lalalalalalallalalaala to drown out all the well thought out logical posts and do stupid shit like nerf White Knight.
---
So yeah. The bitterness will continue until the developers unfuck themselves.
---
Ha, yeah, my lvl 231 apparently never hit lvl 10 :p
---
Is that like the dunce server from early GTAV??
---
Very much just some dude clucking into his mic.
---
Clearly not out of fucks. You're here. 
---
Oh wow that’s commitment. I want to be his friend.   
---
I like it lol
---
YES
---
Pull the ghouls at white springs and jump on cars. I got most of my levels there. You can go there during nuke events too in a rad suit, tag ghouls and let bigger guys take them down. I'm 212 now days but that's how I got most of my early levels. Didn't play in the beta
---
Is the vault boy avatar on the Stat screen smiling or sad? 
---
Give fort defiance a visit. There's always 4-6 BF kicking around the BoS bunk bedrooms on the 3rd and 4th floor. 
---
That last line is so accurate
---
Instigating
---
I do like the little sounds that the frogs make, I must admit. They’d be lovely to have around.
---
Yeah, there's more at prime, as long as you saved up the mass. I was wondering if you could spawn more scorched by picking up the ultracite ore.
---
I just wish I remembered his name. It was one of the most amusing games of Mr. President I've ever been a part of.
---
Another one bites the dust 
---
Refreshing isn't it? lol
---
Hey man, some people suck!
---
Make sure you max out class freak and starched genes perks.
---
Bethesda are NOT trying their best by any means.
---
I would like to see alternate ammo types like new vegas, so explosive wouldn’t be a gun effect it would just be a type of ammo, and for balancing they could make it expensive to craft and degrade weapons faster, less accuracy, etc. For an explosive round I would think it should only do explosive damage and not ballistic. Or less ballistic damage at least.
---
They respawn after a while, but I agree they don't drop the other needed stuff.
---
I did it too. However, it was glitchy. It took a long time to complete and if you crashed you had to start over. It took me 3-4 tries every time I tried that quest to actually stay connected long enough to complete. I have no idea why it no longer works: if that was intentional or an unintentional side-effect of some other change they made.
---
Freaking A, I have never seen mothman so lit up, hes more bug than man its freaky. I've encountered him about two time now in the wild, mostly the eastern zone and those big ass eyes always give me the heebie jeebies
---
Different things are fun for different people.  That's all I can say, since I don't find wrecking people's shit to be fun either.
---
That said...  I did have a cool interaction once where someone shot up my base (actually only destroyed a bit, not the whole thing) and when I came back, we ended up dueling for a while and then making some trades.  He said he did it to "weed out" people who wouldn't want that kind of interaction since they just log out, and either way he ends up with a bounty and can attract hunters.  So I guess the point is that not everyone does this stuff in a totally shitty way....  but a lot definitely do.
---
Instigating is amazing on anything with high damage per shot. Just need to make sure the first shot on each monster counts. No spraying pellets at long range.
---
No problem ma’am. Wiki game theory for an interesting read. It drives a lot of policy thinking, for better or for worse.
---
I'm sure everything goes through Marketing and Legal, instead of Engineering.
---
ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
---
It's part of the known bugs but will get fixed at a later date
---
How can anyone use the word Balance with this game?
---
First balance does not exist in fo76 at all.
---
In what kind of universe (real or imagined)can a .44 mag do more damage then a .50 bmg?
---
Or all most any pistol calibre out perform a rifle?
---
A .50 heavy machine gun. That's a 750 grain bullet at over 3600 fps.
---
Vs. 
---
A .44 mag 185 grain bullet at 1700 fps.
---
A .50 bullet is over half a pound EACH.
---
Your typical frag grenade has a kill radius of about 3 meters nothing lives.
---
A shoulder fired missile will stop a tank.
---
A .50 cal mg is an anti armor/anti personnel whepon. Its bullet is capable of killing a man with 1 bullet at 3/4 of a mile. But in this game your typical 10 mm smg out performs it hands down.
---
And the cyclic rate is WAY TO HIGH clocked mgs at over 1700 rpm that's way to high except for the minigun that was designed to Chew thru people.
---
I really could go on but why BALANCE DOES NOT EXIST IN FO76.
---
IF YOU MAKE A GAME AND THE GUNS DONT KILL YOU SUCK AT MAKING GAMES.
---
Man, this is way better than the glitch I had, which was getting stuck under a porch in Harpers Ferry with a scorched above me so that I couldn't fast travel, but also couldn't kill them through the floor to do anything about it.
---
If you fight the SB Queen and her adds in the radiation zone, you can get 10-20 of each High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, and Hardened Mass and about 140-160 Raw Violet Flux in one nuke. But hardly anyone fights the SB Queen in the radiation zone anymore.
---
WHO COULD HAVE SEEN SUCH A DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING IN THIS GAME
---
If you are using enforcer perk instigating is definitely the way to go since you are already crippling things. Otherwise, I'd still go with instigating. 
---
Where are calibrated shocks plans? I bought explosive vents for the legs from robot vendor last night. Didn’t know I could add more weight. 
---
You can camp anywhere you want to.  The people destroying the camps are grievers pure and simple, following a mob mentality.  There are MANY MORE places the Responders Vendor Bot can be farmed for spawns.  These people are just lazy and/or uninformed.  Plant your flag and flip them off.
---
Thanks for taking an interest in my reddit life. For the record, I don't give a shit about internet points or feelings.
---
Sounds like a typical Texan, helping out a neighbor and asking for nothing in return. At least that's how I was taught to be growing up in Texas. 
---
I like your mindset.
---
I think that might have been my wife... was it on Xbox?  And was she wearing a sniper outfit or duster?
---
(Also, she said that in the future, make sure to blueprint the base or key parts of it st least and you should be able to place things down again)
---
Yeah i found those too, but i think farming the traps is just way faster. Each run gives u 54 tin cans (6 traps with 9 tincans each) That‘s 118 Steel and 54 Lead in like 2 minutes. 
---
yeg he is sad
---
That's nuts, I literally just saw this house on worlds craziest houses on netflix like 3 hours ago and my son compared it to fallout!
---
You can camp where you want, people can't tell you otherwise. If you happen to be griefed then move, i've been happily living behind the church in flatwoods with no problem whatsoever.
---
Anyone found anything?
---
Can't know if you're right or wrong...     
---
But it's hard to maintain the faith it's not going through endless red tape...
---
Not sure where I got mine from. I think it was maybe the vendor bot in that destroyed town above watoga by quite a bit, it’s the only bot in its faction. If I remember the name of the town I’ll edit it in. Though, I haven’t seen any mods for the excavator power armor since then which was months ago.
---
Excavator mods aren’t named like others by the way, so with an x-01 mod it would say “X-01 Calibrated Shocks” but for the excavator power armor it would just say “Calibrated Shocks”.
---
Use Google to try and find a reliable location to find them. They’re very useful.
---
I’m pretty sure if you download the Bethesda launcher, you can download them now my man.  
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
*gasps*
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
for real though. At this point just accept the game as shit and any improvement will be a plus. 
---
I have my auction house there and he still spawns there up the railroad tracks before the bridge just doesn’t spawn by the pond when a camp is near.
---
Might want to learn to read before you comment.
---
You’re on Xbox? Gt Symbiote213  you can have them
---
The geck looks pretty cool. I guess they set it off inside the vault though?
---
this is 1st time i ever played a fallout game, never played any of the one's befor, my friends use to tell me how good they we're, but i never got into them so when this 1  came out friends kept asking me to play it with them, 150 hours later  i'm pretty upset at what i seen so far, kind of makes me never want to try another fall out game again.
---
Odd I played for 2 hours not long ago with no problem. I know PSN is dealing with some issues last I looked.
---
Yea he can be a major pain. I encountered one of them just north of watoga, and man during the fight  I was low on health and stimpacks so I started to put some distance between us. On my run away he captured a scorchbeast, a handful of those scorched assholes, a few nearby molemen, a ground-to-air missile launcher, and some mole rats to help him take me down. Glad to say I got my revenge on him with a tambourine after that.
---
Another time I was in a nuclear launch event to kill the scorchbeast queen, and a flat woods monster appeared and made half of the nearby mobs glowing pink. Local nearby chat is exclaiming "dude why are these things suddenly pink". Those aliens are dicks.
---
I am on Xbox. If you're in I'd love to snag them. I'll gladly pay!
---
Reply to the guys comment, he may not see this otherwise.
---
How do you even do the frame glitch. And if it sounds like a dumb question I apologize but I actually dont play the game I played the beta and it was trash but I'm just curious 
---
Radiation has quite the effect on the mind
---
When I farm I try to kill critters instead of just look for junk. Adds a lovely xp icing. I'm trying to compile a list of every monster that drops good stuff.
---
Sleep for a bit to get an xp buff for a little
---
There's a robot that wanders too usually in the mire. She tells you the story of the 3 little pigs. Yeah there's no one left but in vault 76. The one that is really unbelievable is abby's bunker. It's like she set it up for after she's dead. Who does that!
---
Ya, that’s why I went from loving Bethesda and Fallout, to being completely disappointed and never returning to Bethesda for another game. The industry changes fast..
---
Fuckthesda can afford to spit on fallout76 because everyone will simply forgive them when TES VI will be here
---
Gamer tag is PahlyBoy. I'll join your session. 
---
Oh my gosh, I just remembered something like that back in beta - an “item” named more like a natural attack/ability of a monster that quickly disappeared.  Wish I had screenshotted it...
---
Are they not made for single player? So the addition players give it trouble? What I have read anyways.
---
My brother and I are pretty casual gamers, but we have each put in about 200 hours on this game. We've definitely got our money's worth. We both did the quests and then make up our own or help out lower players. 
---
The key to teaming up when you're more than, say 10 or so levels apart, is to have the lowest level scout ahead to instantiate the enemies and fall back (or wait for you) once they are there.
---
I've got a few gripes, but nothing like the bellyaching I see around here from time to time. I've had fun and met lots of folks. It's a buy from me. 
---
Switch inside, conduit through wall, and comp outside allows for locked access. But it looks horrible
---
They're always empty for me anyways 
---
Yes, seems very erratic, standing in camp, no perks I've tracked it as fast as every 5 minutes and as slow as 20'ish
---
No joke, the exact same thing happened to me a few days ago! It was furnished, yet boring as fuck.
---
Sorry it's the domestic kitchen table plans. 
---
Thank you though!
---
It feels like we are just being trolled by bethesda devs.
---
I have a bad feeling that this is going to turn into an erotic romance novel.
---
Yeah, I could land on it, but it wouldn't let me run up. Looks to be the right path tho!
---
I have to agree with OP, sadly.
---
If it deleted instead of just damaged, sure that could work. Would make having Artillery at your base valuable, say if it let you call air strikes on workshops like in F4. 
---
Bethesda’s ignorance of the community.
---
100% what I do and it works like a charm. 
---
I installed the game after a one-week break. During 1 hour, my weaponS broke TWICE ,i drank 30 purified waters and repaired my armor 3 times.No disconnects though, is that fixed?
---
  Nevermind, deleted again, coming back in  a few months i guess.
---
Uninstall and come back in 6 months . A good 1hour content will be added by then !
---
I can’t speak for PSN, but XB1 has been an absolute dumpster fire. 
---
This reddit adds allot to my game thank you for the advice.  
---
They’re gonna patch that soon
---
I'd like to know how many people are actually working full time on Fallout 76 too.
---
I've always tried my best to stay positive, but recent developements have left me worried.
---
Yeah, play a better game
---
Fallout 76 is running on Amazon aws servers. The performance of the game has nothing to do with the actual servers believe me Amazon knows what they are doing on their end.
---
Momma called the doctor and the doctor said “no more mothmen jumping on the bed”
---
Too be fair there's the Overseer's husband.. He's still alive.
---
You get to help her help him rest easy. By you know, jumping 20 servers to end his meaningful life that cannot seem to get past stairs.
---
Makes wonder how he ever became a scorched.
---
works fine for me evrytime my pet permently dies (as in won't come back even after relog) I always get my budget back
---
The enclave vendor has the x01 mods. Level plays into that farm totally. I didn't see anything good until I was over 100. At 150 started seeing a lot of jetpacks and shocks. Now can jump vendor and get pretty much anything but shocks. Only got 4 shocks out the vendor in total but you're competing with a lot of tryhards who race you to the vendor xD. You know you lost out when only 2 mods left. I think got around 8 jetpacks (one recently last week 1st try) and the rest is common like the bright light.
---
Weapons are really random. You'll get all the good prefixes but combined with exploding is rare. When get exploding it's often with something odd like assassins or mutants. All the cheap tse are dupes.
---
I honestly think they’ve completely given up on the game and are trying to kill it so they can move on. Probably a skeleton crew for a while so they don’t get sued or need to give refunds
---
It's erratic, a few people have reported recovering it by scrapping everything, logging, and then moving their camps...   
---
But that's a nuclear solution..
---
Also never had a problem with this. It may be certain animals on certain platforms
---
Welcome to Reddit
---
Never had this happen, lvl 105
---
I came to mention this as well. It's there, but all we can take are some of the bones, sadly.
---
Firehouse also has a weight room.
---
Since launch I've been looking for these to cover, and was beyond disappointed that just the Man Mask was available. 
---
There are a lot of items that should be in-game that just aren't, which is concerning due to the Atom Shop being a thing. It also appears as negligence of finishing item placement before launch.
---
(One in particular is the Witches outfit, the dress can only be obtained by having the plans for it, even though the Witches Hat is sitting out in numerous locations.)
---
Are you Xbox I've made with both power Gates and garage door brick set looks nice works well only way in and out is through key pad doors.
---
There's a lot of bugs. Some help me though so leave those! Some are really obvious, like how did that make it through play testing. Maybe they are working on new content?
---
probably paid for this months in advance
---
I love fun experiences like this.  Last Thursday night I ran into a couple players around lvl 30-ish that were slowly taking out ghouls at the Whitesprings Golf Club through a window to avoid getting mobbed.  I felt kinda bad because I think I ruined their party when I waltzed straight in with power armor, a lvl 50-ish min/max alt build with an instigating super sledge and grabbed all the aggro.  I gave them a wave, dropped the legendary stuff I got in a bag (since I totally stole their loot because I was being ignorant), gave them a "follow me" emote and took them on a tour of my run through the grounds that hits all the bases efficiently while acting as an aggro magnet and drawing mobs out into the open for them to tag while I can soak up all the damage in a mostly complete lvl 50 suit of T-51b (one pesky lvl 30 right leg to replace) and three ranks of blocker perk. I was playing a sniper since beta day one, so i get that the ghoul swarm at the golf club can feel overwhelming if you're not prepared.  Even if you're prepared, it's a gritty fight as a sniper.  With power armor and a min/max sledge melee build, it's incredibly easy.  Don't take the power for granted, and share when you can.  You can use your game knowledge for good by sprinting towards someone that drew aggro and annihilating the mob that was about to cream them, or giving them a stimpak.  After a mob or three they got my strategy without verbal input and allowed me to soak up damage while blocking as they tagged the mobs and I happily took on janitorial duties.
---
I got two new people on my friend's list, so it was a good day.  76 is 1000x more fun with a team.  Even something so banal as claiming a workshop becomes a ridiculous build-off of an impromptu smoking lounge fit for fools or an air-siren nightmare that gets demolished after a minute because it's way too annoying.
---
Personally, I think it adds to the whole dystopian theme. All these people and all these lives irrevocably changed when the bombs fell. They had some really good voice actors for this one.
---
Wasteland whisperer
---
I'm worried that after they add Survival mode they're just going to be running around trying to clean up PvP bugs and imbalance while the PvE languishes.
---
Great work! It is much appreciated. You have my vote.
---
I always see posts like this but I never find anything free...
---
I love the fallout universe. It does end times for me.
---
Best comment winner is☝️!
---
I have never had any of the problems.  Sounds like maybe your play is off.
---
Check for targeting HUD or Tesla charging barrel. Both are known to instigate crashes.
---
As a suggestion, I would add data filtering to your index rows to allow easy sorting.
---
I saw some guy trade 100 ballistic fiber for adhesive 1:1 in market today
---
PC. 65 on my main, finished most existing quests I think, have hunted most types of interesting creatures already. Old character was 24 during beta but deleted it because I messed up my build at some point. Stopped playing, bored out of my mind. Before that I was just logging in to manage my inventory just to feel the atmosphere a bit.
---
The masons believe there are 2 lines of people. I tend to believe that's true
---
Level 4. Played about 8 hrs. No desire to play anymore. 
---
I think the requirements for Power Armour mods are really over the top and need a complete overhaul.  
---
One example is having to find two mods for two arms etc.  The arm and leg mods should be for both appendages as they were in Fallout 4.  I'm also trying to apply the 'blood cleanser' torso mod but it requires 5 Pure Fluorescent Flux. That's a ridiculous amount of work for one simple, not very exciting, mod for one piece of armour, which will end up being out-moded when you find better armour, particularly when you need a LOT of resources and multiple trips into blast zones just to make one Fluorescent Flux.  I'm not even going to bother now as it's not worth the effort.  I'm level 62 and I haven't been able to make one decent Power Armour mod for any of my levels of armour.  I have T-60 armour and was never able to mod the T-45 or T-51b, except for one leg, despite travelling all over the map. Missed out on some interesting things to do there, despite having made the effort. 
---
It's very hard to sustain interest in a game that doesn't reward you when every little potentially-interesting progression is a grind or made inaccessible.   This seems to be another part of the usual weird, self-destructive, design philosophy that Bethesda has with this game, of denying players anything which could increase their enjoyment or motivation level.  You have to GIVE people things if you want to keep them hanging around.  If you want to sustain interest in a game, I would think you do that by adding things, not by denying them. 
---
They don't seem to be instanced anymore, which makes sense given the new wanted status from taking it from another player.
---
Great jobs but it kinda spoils the fun for me.
---
So I won’t look ;)
---
he is sad
---
I don't know how many hours it was before I came across the Flatwoods monster. He was chilling on a cliff outside Clarksburg. Came up behind him and observed him for a bit then he turned and disappeared.  
---
The timing of this is really crazy because just yesterday I found a way inside this exact statue. It’s accessible via a wall you can walk through and by swimming up through the water filled inside of the building. It’s not an area you’re supposed to access and there’s little of interest but I needed to investigate after the last thread. Great work! 
---
Zenimax their parent company was just as bad also... 
---
When the gold skin for the revolver came out the chat mod was blowing up with people who loved it. Its insane there arent more.
---
Lol there’s always that one consumer that has no problems with getting fucked in the ass.... and that’s you op.  
---
Not all of us like getting fucked in the ass by corporate.  
---
Get some standards grow some balls swallowing and bending over for unfinished products at release.    
---
Stupid average joes on this sub. 
---
Oh yeah, no you're right. I'm sure you know the story better than the developer created and placed notes and holotapes literally talking about how the scorched attacks are thinning the numbers of a settlement and killing everyone.
---
Yeah it be cool to have an artillery on your roof, i think it'll look cool :)
---
It did for that week, I tried after the comment. I haven't played for a month or two so they could have changed it when they "fixed" challenges. 
---
This is Bethesda we're talking about here. They've had plenty of finished games packed full of bugs. They've even acknowledged this themselves.
---
Or both.
---
I have 5 str and have no issues with carry weight.  Stop lugging around so much crap and you’ll be fine. 
---
You fully deserve my up vote
---
Some people find joy in ruining other peoples fun. It’s human nature
---
Do you mean on the Google Sheets version? The Excel spreadsheet is all setup as tables in each tab with default sorting and filtering enabled. I could do more work on the Google Sheets version I suppose to get it working there too. Right now, the Google Sheets version is just an auto-conversion of the Excel workbook without any additional changes.
---
What testers?
---
So your solution to this is to just remove them? 
---
Take them off then and use something else. BOOM! You've removed them.
---
I suppose you must have actually given it a hard try, to play 150 hours upset. Seems like hard work. 
---
That is an Easy one....i am Canadian!
---
 You are just in the middle of the game. Go to the Glassed Cavern and have a look what actually happened to the BOS. Its there for all to see.
---
What's the "frame glitch"?
---
Rad X will suppress your mutation effects.
---
There's more than one?
---
In the ESM (the game's data file) but not available to drop in game. The plans and/or painted armors you've seen came from the Dev Room and anyone that had those plans either had it stripped from their inventory or had their accounts banned.
---
The BoS Initiate Paint is the only BoS paint that legitimately drops in the game, and you get it from Technical Data turn in on the Forbidden Knowledge quest. It took me about 100 turn-ins to get it.  
---
What all do you carry on you? And how much base carry weight do you have?
---
Not sure how you can tell anything from that. There should be plenty of images on the web that would better illustrate your point.
---
It says in the status page when it does this, I don't really use rad x or diluted rad x.
---
I need the skull mask and napoleon mask
---
Yeah. It's pretty annoying. Seems like I'm constantly going to my inventory to drink.
---
.001% to be exact.
---
No .308 combat rifle, that's a bummer.
---
Wait, is the tesla gun counted as a heavy weapon for the purpose of perks?
---
The lighting conditions are too different to really compare. 
---
How did you get the Paladin paint job? Do I just have to keep doing Forbidden Knowledge?
---
Good question, haven’t seen any yet.
---
That’s unfortunate, if you’re still interested I think you should look at some gameplay or reviews for 3, 4, and new Vegas, I’ve enjoyed all of the games event the originals 1, 2, and tactics, but fallout 76 does have a LOT of problems right now, with time though I think it will improve, I just hope the community doesn’t give up on it.
---
I'm surprised UFC went through with it, contract or no.
---
lol cloth, some dog food, and a day tripper? There's never really any reward. Loot/rewards are seriously the worst thought out in this game that I've ever seen.
---
I still love it, but jesus. It's bad.
---
It’s bizarre. These aren’t in depth changes. Many of the recent patches are barely more complex than changing a few values in the Creation Kit. I’ve seen other devs release two or three hotfixes in a single day especially after an update.
---
Say what you will about Fortnite, but it manages to have new content that keeps players involved what feels like every day. When you move into the online content sphere, this is the sort of thing people expect. Hell, even Witcher 3 had weekly content updates for months while they worked on the big DLCs.
---
Point being, the current lack of content is really unacceptable for a game like this.
---
You're liable to get your camp leveled if you do. A lot of people destroy any C.A.M.P. there on sight, due to it potentially blocking a trader from spawning. 
---
You got a hoarding problem
---
Seriously? 
---
Of course it's fine, just dont come back with a " griefers are ruining this game" post, because placing your camp there is the same thing as putting it outside whitesprings with turrets 
---
Why i said risk vs reward its not worth it dont do only low levels benifit form a drop 
---
We didn't bother, we just nuked the place
---
That was the only time I had my mutations not work, when I used RadX in a nuke zone without thinking about it.
---
Honestly? Nothing. The game's arguably in a worse state than when it launched. 
---
I find myself just logging in to do a sales loop of all the vendors every day, but there's little to keep me logging in. My friends have all stopped playing.
---
I'll mess around with something for a Challenge, or explore someplace new sometimes, or just go visit random places. But yeah... there's nothing new. And it's sad.
---
Facts.
---
Honestly I am starting to think these are people actively trying to destroy the game.  They gain nothing from this except ruining the experience for others and in turn drive away many new players.
---
Beth has totally failed to fix this sort of griefing and I would bet a large portion of those that left the game likely had this happen to them. that feeling of helplessness watching your CAMP be destroyed is what a lot of people will think of when they remember fo76.
---
The PR blunder Beth refuses to fix.
---
You must not move for about 10 or 15 sec till the whole world has renewed or you can be stuck till you reload have it happen a lot on xbone
---
Been there. That wasn't the entire brotherhood of steel.
---
To be honest, by nerfing TSE instead of buffing other effects, they've sort of kill the "OMG I FOUND SOMETHING AWESOME" rewards too.
---
TSEs are still *good,* but not "I feel okay with the hundred hours I ground to get lucky with this" - there's nothing left to fill that niche.
---
Or like the overseer.. you get all these tapes of her but no sign of her.. it would have been nice to see someone.. I'm so lonely. 
---
Only time I run pa is nuke zone or uranium fever.  Otherwise I run full Metal armor. The only enemies I have issues with are high lvl col gutsys.  They still just shred me. Even lvl 80 sbs are more than doable without pa.
---
 It was the end of it. They were not killed by Scorched but by Scorched Beasts of many kinds, just overwhelmed.
---
No you aren't the only one.
---
I have been amused, bemused, frustrated, and disappointed with a lot of the bugs and setbacks, and the imbalanced nature of combat, but I'm still enjoying it. 
---
All of this and you can't even post what system you're on. 
---
Level 34 Xbox, haven’t counted the time, still enjoying it.
---
I hear that some people also nuke Harper’s Ferry for making Stable Violet Flux
---
I haven't been able to do it for more than a week.
---
no i've had her do that plenty of times it just happens sometimes it's rare but happens
---
I play with all of them class freak and starched go strange in numbers and its all pluses except 1 point of str when solo .
---
Many people will say different things. Personally, Fallout 76 is an unstable mess on my PC while others will claim that it runs butter smooth on theirs. Personally I'd go PS4 just cause it's at the very least a stable 30 fps.
---
You should be good on laptop. I run a 1050P and thigs work just fine. For heat. get a bunch of flat ice packs and keep them on rotation in a freezer. Stick the packs in a laptop case and slip them beneath your laptop.
---
I just had to close the game, then jump back in. Sure, no more Deathclaw, but the budget came back.
---

Same. Had two completely different encounters in two different games last night. Had a friend who has just gotten his PS4. First game he got was Red Dead 2. Was online with him last night and was trying to help him build up his RD character, and spent an hour in game hunting to get meat/skins to sell. We both had a huge stash of skins which included bear, cougar,elk,deer,wolf and many others. Had just decided to go sell, when we both lost the lot after some random jerk come along randomly just to kill us. Wasted time and effort. We logged off that. 
---
Finally, got my friend onto Fallout for the first time. Made his way though the Vault where i met him. Worked our way down to the Overseers camp where 2 people came along. Suddenly one of them waved Hello and started jumping up and down on the Overseers stash box and giving the Thumbs Up. Just like that, they left 1100, 10mm rounds for us. I gave them to my friend and we thanked them. And that,despite the glitches, is why i like 76. The Community. As odd and as quirky as it can be, it's a good one. 
---
You are right about the effort thing. It is worrying. I do want to see the game do well and come back to an improved title. I will probably even log in from time to time. I have a hard time letting go. But it is difficult to continue when the game isnt very rewarding.
---
Add me AvitarOfStealth xbone
---
Once you're high enough level, have someone escort you through the mayor for a day questline so the robots won't attack you. After that you can just walk around killing any robot you can take in a fight.
---
Wow, I just wrote a very similar post. Built up 3 workshops and the game crashed. Such a waste of time (and materials).
---
I am the polar opposite.  I'll take any excuse to fire one off.  Hell, a couple of people took the munitions factory from a friend of mine earlier tonight, so I nuked it ... perhaps it was not the most measured response, but it was fun as hell.
---
You know the flaatwoods monster is just a deformed Zeatan alien with really short legs
---
now thats a full blown coyote ugly.
---
Why do you rock pa for uranium fever?
---
Seriously. Those are just two that I know of. I'm guessing there's more.
---
What is this obsession with the ratio of positive to negative comments? It's both. It was the best of games, it was the worst of games. No one can fault the world itself, the detail, the endless hours spent creating the exterior and interiors. Jaw dropping! But there have been and continue to be glaring bugs. 
---
Could you tell me your psn and I’ll add you tomorrow?
---
Try it solo maybe?  I can cruise through a silo in like 30 min.  Hack the turrets to kill the bots, shut them down when the shooting stops.  The 2nd part is the toughest for me with the rads, about the only time I use PA.  If you use the turrets right you'll only need to fight a handful of bots on the way to the launch room.  Knowing the route is the toughest part of the silos, I wish they were all different.
---
Do you have a PlayStation?
---
Nah, soz
---
I enjoy PvP as much as the next person, but being hit by someone who is using the ability to have unlimited critical hits in VATS is completely ruining the fun. Hope they fix this.
---
Just to update the thread, I found this in the Advanced Power Connector plans. I bought it tonight at the Watoga RR Station but I’d previously seen it at other vendors as well. 
---
That’s what I’m thinking. 
---
Ikr? In previous BGS titles (I know this technically isn't one) I'd more complain of having TOO MUCH to do. Your qest log was always filled with stuff to do. But after like the first 100 hrs. All that was left in 76 were events and dailies.
---
Thanks! The ice pack thing is a little weird imo and I’ll be passing on that but I appreciate the info. 
---
Oh, well thanks anyway!
---
Fixed. 
---
Yeah that’s the main reason I’m thinking ps4.
---
You guys do realize this was their third studio developing this one right? Like all the fucking interns are in Austin or wherever it's located
---
Any particular reason those cause crashing, like does anyone know why?
---
starting a new character is quite refreshing actually, an early level character has less bugs around   
---
(less bugs, there are still some)  
---
its been that way with many of their open world engines/games, take it from someone who mods em and pushes em too the limit!!  
---
I'm not a programmer, so I can't say for sure. My guess is that they both overlay enemy textures and there's a fault in the code that does the overlay.
---
I leave mine in the tool box at the overseers camp, yesterday dropped a ton plans for a newbie there, it made her day😊
---
Get into power armor (can be just a frame). Move power armor close to area you want to glitch into (like right next to a vault door) go into 3rd person. Exit out of armor, while at the same time kinda spinning the camera around and spamming the button to reenter power armor. If done correctly you'll see the animation to enter your armor, but your character will be in front of the armor. When you complete the animation, ie, entering the armor, you'll be in your armor, but the game will move your position to where your character was while entering the armor.
---
Hope I explained right. Kinda confusing.
---
I think bringing MLK into this is rather insulting to be honest just saying its a fucking video game.
---
Martin Luther King Jr is a rather more serious topic for a video game.
---
Equating a game you don't like with the struggles of Dr. King doesn't quite fly but I'm just an old white guy, what do I know?
---
Well it's just an example that things can change if we want
---
I know it's just like an example 
---
A bad one
---

I'm surprised there aren't more salvaged robot weapons. All you'd need to do is rip off their arm and rig up a trigger.

PS4? tonight was crazy for me. Got disconnected within minutes on four serves in a row.

Boycotting eating vegetables as a kid 
---
It's an exo'e lmao I'll add it in the post 
---
Have you ever thought that mayhap some folks just don't want to shit on other folks joy? I'm pretty dissatisfied with 76 at the moment, and Bethesda as well, but I don't look at a thread about a positive experience in the game and think "Man, I should just fuckin' rain on their parade". If I see a negative post, it feels more acceptable to vent my own frustrations. 
---
Lmao are you a costumactor ? 
---
It has something to do with Class Freak and/or  Starched Jeans. Try removing them.
---
What the hell is a "costumactor"
---
There’s about 10, if I’m right. I had a guy paint mine with the Paladin one until I found out that and all the non-initiate ones come from the dev room.
---
I run a sneak/sniper build with next to no armor and excert for the Sierra Bravos I don't get killed much unless I let myself get mobbed.
---
What’s that? You found something new and interesting that didn’t involve doing mundane errands? 
---

Side note: if any of you have the opportunity to attend Fasnacht in Helvetia, WV then by god do it. I've attended twice. 
---
It is in Helvetia, a small Swiss farming community way off the beaten path. The evening starts with community members bringing their instruments to the town hall while the drinking and dining starts. After sunset the homemade masks come out and every single person participates in a parade to the dance hall where the a bonfire is already blazing. Here it is like a giant wedding reception. There are plenty of dances that require participation from everyone, which is totally not awkward because at this point everyone is plenty toasted. Then, around midnight, they cut a giant Old Man Winter down from the ceiling of the town hall, carry it outside and throw it into the fire - followed by a merry drunken bellowing of Country Roads.
---
Punctuation: Perfect. Delivery: On point. Two thumbs up, would read again.
---
I use cryolator a lot, havent ever seen it happen 
---
I use the perk loadout manager mod. A great mod for different loadouts.
---
I have 15 points in melee and have perk cards equiped that give me more melee damage. This is my combat loadout.
---
Next to it i have a loadout with lockpick and hacking.
---
And third loadout has reduced weight and higher carrying weight cards.
---
So whenever i grind somewhere for experience, or fought the sbq and other mobs arround there and i'm full on weight i just switch to my 'carrying weight' perk loadout and i can fast travel again to camp or another place to sell the stuff.
---
Imo mods really help the game be more accaptable to play ;)
---
This is so good. xD   
---
Whenever I notice I have a neighbor camp I go and leave a pie in front of their door. Once I did it, and the guy just logged out, lol.  Just left me standing with a pie on the ground.
---
Well my translation maybe not right, it come from the French "consommacteur", made of the made "consommeur" which mean "costumer" and "acteur" which mean "actor", so it mean that you can make a boycott of a product due to his production methods, like People aren't buying Nutella because they are using Palm Oil
---
Ah ok
---
Shhhhhh! The devs are gonna hear this and nerf Ballistic Fiber payout!
---
It's still fine with White Knight unless you get hit far too much. I've run a few dozen silos without PA and my troubleshooter pieces haven't needed repair yet.
---
Don't fight scorchbeasts without anti-explosion mods though (padded, dense). They trash your armor horribly quickly.
---
Here it is[Fast Travel](https://imgur.com/gallery/lcbErXP) 
---
Quite hard hum ? Maybe you haven't studied economy ? 
---
I did offer a different solution.
---
that or the pistols challenge is bugged
---
Dude, I never even got a two shot or an explosive before they nerfed them (also still haven't) , and I'm pissed about the nerf. The reason that was the meta is because enemies are too spongy, and instead of fixing THAT to make ranged builds viable, they nerfed the things that actually made ranged builds viable.
---
People who stopped playing have valid opinions, and online games like this need a player base to exist, so trying to shut down any conversation about the game's flaws with "they don't play anymore, they don't count" is not great for the longevity of the game. 
---
I want to like 76, but I find myself not playing it because it feels more like a job than a game. 
---
Not sure if for the purpose of perks, but that's where it appears in the build menu.
---
I hope you all feel silly for forking out whatever stupid price the institute decided to slap on this mess because I bought Fo4 GOTY for Xbox from Amazon last week for £16 🤓🤭
---
If you connect a computer to the outside switch of the powered door you can lock the computer so people need at least lvl 3 hacking to open it.
---
Melee is the current meta, but I've been perfectly happy with my rifle build. Repair costs aren't nearly as horrific as everyone makes them out to be, just remember that certain weapon mods increase or decrease your weapons total durability 
---
Automatic weapons are pretty awful all around, as a heads up, so just avoid those weapons and any related perks.
---
Going Luck is pretty nice early game since you get extra ammo, resources, meds and edibles with the right perks. For me I ended up with more than I could stash/carry until end game.
---
I went full Luck and only after that i started making my build around my weapon type of choice and such.
---
Sure, because Fallout purity is the most important agenda for everyone, everywhere.
---
Yeah, power armor is essentially a requirement now, which kind of sucks. I'd prefer it to be a build style, not a necessity
---
Get's told he's peaked, replies that I have not peaked.  Cool.  Please, continue.  😂
---
Don’t play fo76 but it seems cool. I love spreadsheets!
---
Dude, my ranged build is viable. I've been playing ranged since beta.
---
Trying to shut down any conversation that doesn't side with TSE is not great for the longevity of the game. There are so many other conversations to have for actual improvements _that have not a !@#$ thing to do with two affixes_.
---
Is the video ready?
---
I did Event- AWOL armaments 3 or 4 times in the past few days and always got a a legendary glowing Gutsy at the end.  I believe they were all 3 star but only 1 dropped a 3 star raider leg or something.
---
My nephew 2000 miles away just downloaded the game today and we're going to play tomorrow from the beginning. Pretty excited about that. My advice: get a nephew.
---
If you have a Dense mod on the torso, Scorchbeasts do more damage against PA.
---
Gutsies are extremely dangerous against PA too, although I think PA does have some hidden damage reduction. I go up to four Troubleshooters pieces for silos, which helps quite a lot.
---
Today was the day I gave up. I uninstalled the game. It's pretty obvious that Bethesda/Zenimax doesn't care about this game.
---
Good luck
---
Then you are still addicted to something. Addictol cures one addiction at a time. Try another is my advice. You can have multiple addictions. (And they haven't been showing up except for sad face.) 
---
Wait do the interiors have nuked enemies too? That had never occurred to me. 
---
Could you share those places, please?  I have never read of any other location for that unique vendor.  Thanks!
---
ahh yes that explains it..i used a xouple.of addictol and disease cure and  now im fine thnx.very much
---
They dorm care. 
---
Then probably went on to watch me do whatever that daily quest is where you shoot different animals with darts. Took the long road, no fast travel to any of the spots, stop along the way for whatever interesting pops up in between. Probably hour or so. Dart the final animal, voice says “congratulations...” and immediate crash. Couldn’t turn in quest. Thanks devs. Hope your Saturday night was fun at least. 
---
I dont know. If I put commando on and use AA/AAE or F/FE automatics can chew through enemies. Sure you use more ammo it they go down super quick. 
---
I too am enjoying rifles though. Normally just run with my lever. 2 or 3 shots on about everything if I stay hidden or in caution. 
---

---
I must just be hot garbage then. Hot, sexy garbage. 
---
I'm not saying that TSE should be the meta. I'm saying that nerfing them was not the way to fix the meta. They became the meta because too many enemies are bullet sponges. I returned to my camp to find 3 super mutants, all lower level than me, and it took me a good 15 minutes of running around and taking pot shots to put them down because they ate my lead like candy. 
---
The game feels like a chore to me. Too many enemies that just soak up ballistic damage. At this point, I'm just waiting for private servers so I can mod the shit out of it. 
---
Yes, thirst seems increased (by quite a bit) since last update.
---
It's just that the rate of ammo consumption just isn't worth it. You burn through ammo and have to craft more constantly; you can do the same amount of damage with a semi auto weapon and save the mats 
---
Have you tried picking up the orders on ft defiance to trigger it? I've never had it just spawn in as a daily
---
&gt;community managers
---
lol
---
I had this same problem. 
---
Traveling pharmacy is only necessary if you carry a lot of healing. I get around that by healing with Nuka cola and using Thru Hiker, but that might be hard for you to do. Even so, try to limit yourself to about 20-30 total healing items at a time, and you should be able to manage.
---
Bandolier is only necessary if you have a ridiculous amount of ammo. Cut down.
---
Sturdy Frame contributes a very limited amount to your carrying capacity. Ditch it, especially if you mostly run power armor.
---
Pack Rat isn't worth it. You should be scrapping your junk, which makes it weigh so little that a 75% reduction is also ridiculously small.
---
Make up the difference with deep pockets on everything, and actively seek out armor with carry weight reductions.  You can do it! I have all of my damage perks on for the first time ever.
---
I broke my self imposed rule against watching youtube videos and now I remember why.
---
If you are not running for farm in nuked flora/fauna then just nuke other places, like small cities and such (low level areas for example). Its just a little fun if you are bored/have nothing else to do.
---
Repair costs are fine for rifles by default, other than the Dragon. It's possible that some legendary effects (eg two-shot, explosive) have some hidden condition loss penalties, but two-shot is bad now anyway. Shotguns seemed to break faster, but I doubt it's a significant problem. Energy weapons are generally terrible and should be avoided unless you like grinding materials.
---
Yea I get what you mean. Just saying a good full commando build does do good damage but as we both said uses more ammo :)
---
Slow down, this is not Fortnite.
---
&gt;Slow down, this is not Cancer.
---
^(Bleep bloop. I am a carcinogenic bot |) ^[info](http://redd.it/amo7ot/)
---
Effects would have to be weapon specific not weapon-type specific. One could simply legendarify a semiautomatic combat rifle and give it an automatic receiver.
---
This. I spent 12 hours today looking for a upgrade and didn't get a single one. This is the 8th day of full time playing with no upgrades. Plenty of trash Legendary, no good legendaries.
---
It's not a matter of not getting any. It's a matter of the hundred's that I've gotten are trash. If you guys would invest some actual time into making more than 3 types of legendaries worth having on the weapon side and 1-2 types on the armor side it'd go a long ways in improving the versatility of this game.
---
Happened to me the other day. Pretty sure I had used an int bobblehead for repair or possibly read a magazine to reduce inventory space and had the radworms bug at the same time. I'll check tomorrow to see if I can replicate
---
You are the amazing. Thank you so much
---
Glad to help. 
---
I don't use PA whatsoever on my character at level 100+, not even nuke zones, nor do I use white knight until it comes time to repair. I couple that with fix it good, and I'm good for a couple days.
---
I'm a stealth sniper though, so get hit rarely.
---
pictures like this is a fine example how they released this game half ready... no its not future dlc ist just unfinished part of the game.
---
TSE should not be the meta. I said it.
---
I have no idea what to tell you if you're having trouble with super mutants. There are _plenty_ of busted weapons (here's looking at you, laser rifle) and plenty that no one talks about (plasma rifle). I'd probably believe you if you said you were chasing low level muties with a laser rifle and a beam splitter...... But anything that fires lead is not going to take 5 minutes per level 35 super mutant. That's not this game.
---
Its a normal event like every other event now you can still server hop for it but going inside doesnt activate it anymore you just have to get lucky. So bassicly its like uranium fever or what ever its called or like the enclave events
---
except anyone that's played since BETA has been under the impression that you can do that. This isn't something that was changed a long time ago. And why give people the quest if they get wanted for it now?
---
Bethesda employee: oh look, a struggling level 47 solo player is trying to walk somewhere instead of fast travelling. Lets spawn two scorchbeasts in at the same time. Also lets make it so they never stop attacking and are impossible to kill. If they keep complaining we will put a 10 second window in between their attacks. This will distract the players into thinking we are making it easier on them while we nerf all of their weapons. Lol i bet these idiots will still buy elder scrolls 6
---
this is just unfinished part of the game, nothing else. this is why u buy plans from vendors instead get as quet revards.
---
Most use it for chems. I never cook soups
---
How about some weapon skins that you unlock ingame. 
---
You know, show us you're not scumbag dev's looking to milk us for as much money as possible. You're not EA after all =P
---
its fixed long ago.
---
uh ok
---
It's okay if you like the game, little guy. Look what sub you're on.
---
I'm agreeing with you that it shouldn't be the meta, but it was, and the reason for that was how spongy the enemies are. 
---
I never said that they were level 35, just that they were lower level than me. They were 45-50. I was 54.
---
Was wondering if it's partly caused by the player targeted by the queen dying and respawning. The one time it happened to me, I was the only player left alive after the other two died to a radscorpion.
---
I’m sure exactly this A&amp;B duo you’re talking about did this to me yesterday. However, they so kindly waited to kick me off right before I killed the very last super mutant of the very last wave, while defending my second workshop. Alas, no reward. 
---
I see you A&amp;B, I see you...
---
&gt; if you didn't call one,don't open it.
---
"Do the opposite of what the game tells you"
---
Yes, if you get rad worms when it is removed from you your mutations stop working until you relog. It's constant as of this last patch.
---
&gt; So we spend time getting all this dried food and putting it into a processor, and then we can't even use it? 
---
Of course you can use it.  Everyone who's in the event gets the canned stew.
---
(And by "in the event" I mean "near Mamma Dolces", I got it while scavving Vault-tec U).
---
You can't judge the graphics of the whole game with the graphics of weapons on display. The display on weapons are missing antialising, it has been like that from the start, they look jagged. The game itself looks amazing, especially on a 1440p display like mine. I have flickering fences and buildings in PUBG but on Fallout 76 everything is flawless no flickering on buildings at all. I love their engine.
---
Alright, Bania...THIS is the MEAL! 
---
A: You know what would be funny?  
---
B: What?  
---
A: If I dupe this guys corn 1500 times whenever his camp gets packed up.  
---
B: Dick move man.  
---
B: ... I'll put in the patchnotes tomorrow that its an exploit.  
---
*A &amp; B crack a cold one.*
---
I heard that adding a searchlight works well. I didn't lose any chunks of base after adding one, but it's not much of a proof.
---
35 or 50, same is same. You should try a shotgun (a normal one) if you need them to stand still for whatever you're shooting at them with.
---
The only thing I could possibly take 5 minutes killing a super mutant with would probably be a ripper. The boxing glove is stronger than that thing......
---
Weight reduction is a trade-off. In a survival based game, it should be that way.
---
Not everyone should be able to hoard gear &amp; Min-Max combat stats 
---
Yup, just go in in regular armor.  You'll catch some rads by the bridge but nothing big.  PA is only good for carry weight and MAYBE rad resistance at a certain point in the silos, but only because it's a pain the ass to switch back from the hazmat suit.
---
Most I talked about (and was angry about) was the Unstoppables event a couple weeks ago. These were related to the lunchboxes?
---
First mistake was using your own junk for workshops, never do that 
---
Second no hope in hell I'm wasting a penny on anthem 
---
nope. the moment you place a crop their 6th sense kicks in and they can start sniping even with a shotgun, scorched do this as well.
---
Ok, I'll bite. What is exo'e? Unless it's autocorrect for example, looks like that what you meant. Still doesn't make sense.
---
why am I getting downvoted for that?
---
Mmm, nothing like a good spreadsheet
---
I'm fine with it how it is, I  just wish the Atom Shop was more based on the game it's in, rather than looking like a catalogue from The Sims. There's too much glamour on there.
---
I've been very happy with performance on my old PS4--not even a PS4 Pro. Only times I have any real issues seems to be wifi related (cheap range expander needing to be restarted every couple days). I usually keep the PS4 straight into Ethernet now tho and don't seem to have near as many disconnects as I did about a month ago.
---
Ok I am not sure about the alien blaster plan since I have found the plan
---
I dont grow any crops. I'm a carnivore \^\_\^
---
Thanks for the tips guys! Time to feel like the doom slayer!
---
Why? It‘s not so difficult to withstand any buying instinct regarding the atom shop.
---
hmm not sure then, using an atom bed by chance? apparently they can cause the same aggro
---
Fallout 1 was also my first Fallout game in the late 90s. I recently stopped playing at Level 72 and played around 60% of the game with a friend.
---
I loved exploring the map (missed a big city environment, but Watoga was ok). I liked (and hated) the movable camp, the overview map, the emoticons, a few of the new enemies, the view when a nuke get's dropped and Rose and Graham. This is the nicest things i can say about this game.
---
I don't know how many hours I played but I would assume around 60 hours. So in terms of hours I probably played it more than Fallout 1 (including replays). If I ignore the drama around the game and for the time spend in it, it was the most unmemorable Fallout game I've played to date. In the last third of my game I started to feel bad for wasting my time.
---
Agree! The stuff in the shop is ridiculous and totally outta tone with the game. I'd happily save atoms and buy USEFUL items for my camp
---
Absolutely agree. It's a very flawed game but there's some fun to be had
---
For your first character , go melee, you get a quest reward Super Sledge you can use all the way to the end and the excavator armor you make during a quest is good enough too. You wont be drop or bullet dependent. 
---
I definitely agree with that.
---
&gt; Out of them, 2 of them actually never bought the game to begin with.
---
2 admitted it.
---
Any update on the ban situation?
---
I like these ideas. Even if you had to do a "Retake the Workshop" type thing upon rejoining the server, it's a much better alternative to what we have now. I really hope they implement some of these ideas soon. There are certainly much bigger fish to fry than unnecessary perk nerfs and new PvP game modes when people can't reliably access/complete endgame content or hold workshops.
---
Autocorrect, it mean that we've to a t for this game that we love, don't you ? 
---
Trust me, I know. But I’m tired of seeing whatever dogshit they make sent directly to the shop for an outrageous price. What’s more, it’s more Sims than Fallout. Wouldn’t you rather there be no Atom Shop, pay $20-$30 for a big expansion that adds new content, including CAMP and clothing, to the WORLD, instead of the store?
---
I step out of my power armor with confidence every time knowing I shop at the atomic store. 
---
Pong
---
Dwarf Fortress 
---
Well that's just like your opinion or whatever man. Now that I have the appropriate movie quote I must say that I disagree. I enjoy power armor skins and the decor for my cap. I'm sorry that you feel that way but there is nothing that you are forced to buy. It is all cosmetic do your hatred makes no sense. Now let me guess how the next few comments are going to go. "Pay to Win" "Grognak" "distasteful and ignoring games from my childhood" "they're better than this" "you're a dick" "you're what's wrong with this community"...Now that I've saved us all some time can we just go kill things and enjoy ourselves for one day without someone crying about something they want changed?

I was curious why is it I have a raiders vanguard chest that has sentinels but doesn’t say sentinels? I thought it was supposed to say sentinels unless is it specific set of perks that cause it to be called sentinels?
---
I thought I was tripping but yeah it def seem like the last update increased thirst. I used to be able to manage it pretty well but now it's depleting like crazy. It's not a huge problem, I have tons of water and teas, but it's just odd and didn't seem to always be that way.

An imagined conversation between *the* two Bethesda employees on a Saturday night
---
Here's my build https://i.imgur.com/3cmkrSJ.jpg
---
Two-shot weapons don't really work with vats so i'm not using them. Vats will say it's a 95% chance but it will miss constantly when i use two-shot weaponry. 
---
My current build usually allows me to stay in vats until the end of a fight. Especially if it's vs multiple opponents. I would stack up the 15% with crit savvy for more goodness. 
---
Never used medic...
---
If you follow some guide it will tell you that psychopath isn't necessary if you use four leaf clover but they work extremely well together; especially when combined with Adrenaline. I don't think you should follow any standards when making your build. Do what works for you. I'm even using AP regen legs (instead of carry weight)  for my power armor and AP torso. My AP bar completely fills up in 5 seconds allowing me to jump back into vats as soon as possible. It proved to be really useful in prolonged fights. 
---
My main damage dealer is an instigating hunting rifle. If my adrenaline is activated i can one-shot pretty much any fodder mobs such as glowing bloated ghouls (i always get their name wrong). Scarier things will take 2-3 shots. A regular lvl 50 scorched beast will require up to 25 .308 shells.
---
I wish i had another rifle to use during the fight... instigating is only good for the first shot.
---
Anyway, do some of your own testing with two-shot guns maybe they only miss a lot for me? Tho there are lots of people with the same issue.
---
Exactly.  Placing your camp anywhere the game lets you is perfectly fine.  Also, rampaging through someones camp because you want to is also perfectly fine.  The game allows for both.  It's also fine for people to then call you an asshole in voice chat.  The magic of online games!! :D
---
He isn't being serious. The servers seem to have given quite a few people issues over the past week or so.
---
"cool party man. You got any rodents?" 
---
The crashes have improved, they are more consistent now
---
I've notice Yao Guai usually carry quote a few of each but they're not always easy to find. Enclave missions usually pay out with good junk
---
Are you still selling the blue uniform
---
Orrrrrr... you could just not look at the Atom Shop, let it exist without paying for either thing. I mean, the DLC is going to be free, regardless of any purchase in the Atom Shop, so what are you even complaining about?
---
Ill give you 2000 caps 
---
feed the people and the other factions are helping us, the players help eachother, just FYI.
---
most bots on the other hand aren't programmed to deal with sudden loss of their owners so they dont see them as missing.
---
otherwise yeah alot of the quests and stuff are just blind helping nobody
---
Just use a flame thrower then melee them to death.
---
Agreed there needs to be more PvE content coming soon. I def feel like this game will have a much longer and brighter future with a greater focus on more actual PvE content instead of PvP. Fix the huge issues with the core game first, but def emphasize PvE content and then balance and build PvP around that. There's soooo much potential with this game. I'd hate to see it squandered in pursuit of being a Fortnite type game... which is the vibe I get from their emphasis on PvP with Survival mode, wacky colorful Atom Shop content, and Bethesda Austin's previously canceled game.
---
Just because they're dead, it doesn't mean they can just not pay their bills.
---
I hate it when I don't want to PVP but want resources from a workshop but some other guy has setup there before me.  So I server hop to find an empty one but get unlucky and the next server also has someone already there.  I just want easy resources, these people are griefing me!!!  /s
---
Server hopping shouldn't even be a thing, but since it is we have to accept the fact that things on the next random server after hopping may not be how we'd want them to be in a perfect world.  I mean c'mon, they are taking away your chance at a chance?  
---
If this ain't the damn truth everytime I get on.  
---
&gt; Lever action rifle reload animation has been a bug since 4 
---
Lever action reload animation was never a "bug", it was a requested feature that wasn't implemented and it took *years* for modders to come up with unreliable "fixes" for it. 
---
The railway rifle has very high damage by default. Very limited range though, and the projectiles get caught on things.
---
That's applicable to anyone who just doesn't enjoy certain stories. 
---
My hero. Thank you!!!! Great work.
---
I'm starting to see a lot of people thinking they are playing a single player game, and getting annoyed at player/player  interactions.  
---
Carry weight mainly. I grab everything.  UF is my steel farm. Usually end up with 400-500 steel scrap on a good run
---
I wish this info was more widely know.  I suspect though that some people just want to watch camps burn and use this simply as a pretext.
---
I really don't understand why people keep treating it as if everyone being dead is suppose to be a surprise. 
---
They might release 4 and 5* legendary and doing so all the duped items become inferior. And expect more nerf in legendary armor in the future.
---
&gt; I know for a fact it's not tough to make changes like attack speeds, damage thresholds, durability rates etc. Anyone that thinks it is coming from a point of view where they have no programming experience of a larger system. 
---
Of course it's easy to do it.  It's just not easy to do it *right*.  Every one of these changes needs consideration of how they affect the rest of the game.  The biggest mistakes Bethesda Austin have done so far are all related to exactly that.
---
There's already a poster for your camp advertising an explosive ammo type
---
Same here. :(
---
My camp is 5 seconds of sprinting from a power armor spawn point. It doesn't have a fresh set every time that cell reloads, but it does often enough — and they often enough contain cores — that I don't bother grabbing them unless they're above 90%. Even if I were a regular power armor user without the conversation perks, I doubt I'd ever run out, just from the minimal effort it takes to harvest those. I also scrap the power armor pieces that spawn; even with Scrapper, though, they don't generate much steel (which I always need for ammo).
---
I can make that happen. Scaly skin is on a friend's mule, but I can get them when he's on tomorrow. How does 500 each sound? Add me regardless: femiwhat.
---
&gt; Is it possible their coding is really unoptimized and hard to dig through

Okay stupid question. Are there two different versions of mothman? When I started playing the game and went to the mothman museum I expected. Him to be like the statue. Not a literal moth. 
---
Gram, as stated, but possibly also the expensive Whitesprings vendor?
---
That's not true. If you wait anyway, you can still get loot.
---
No PvE only PvP and fortnight style battle royals.
---
WOW.
---
This is a well-written, -reasoned, and -intentioned post! Bravo. But:
---
I will follow its advice when, but only when, players with pacifist settings (like me, always) aren't put at risk of unwanted PvP by claiming a workshop. 
---
Until then, claiming a workshop makes you the target of griefers, and life is just *too d@mned short*. I'd rather buy ballistic fiber than put up with that nonsense.
---
Best
---
There shouldn’t be anything wrong with investing in a workshop. Especially if you plan on sitting on it for a while. 
---
What looks so wrong with Anthem?
---
Why? 
---
&gt; I'd say "just let Obsidian take over"
---
Yeah, let the studio that released the bug filled FO:NV who have no experience in online games do it.  Good call.

I’m not sinking any more koney into this game.

In a survival game, a rifle shouldn't weight 25+ pounds.

That word, it does not mean what you think it means.
---
They haven't bothered to fix the bugs in Fallout 76 that were ported over from — but that have long since been fixed *in* — Fallout 4.
---
I get that they have to triage, and set priorities, and that's a good thing. Given some of their recent game-breaking screw-ups, I of course wanted to see those fixed most urgently.
---
But I expect someone doing the prioritization said to him- or herself, "How many other treasure map locations *are* working? Okay, then, this goes to the bottom of the list."
---
I can't quibble with that. But I agree: This is surely something that ought to be easily fixable (since, indeed, the other locations *do work*, and they should be able to copy &amp; paste some code to fix this, surely!). And it's been a known bug since early beta. Bethesda is just too damned tolerant of bugs, frankly.
---
Has somebody actually used money on Atom Shop? I have gotten everything that I want+more free by playing the game.
---
I love this game and still play it, not as much as at the start, because the bugs are slowly killing it for me. 
---
I swear I have some bad luck with technology because I always get the buggiest/worst experiences with stuff. Hell, I couldn’t even open a bank account without the entire in-bank system crashing...
---
Anyway, I love this game but the bugs are slowly pushing me away. I wouldn’t have noticed how tedious certain things are if I didn’t lose hours of gameplay and materials from disconnects and bugs. 
---
Nope, on PS4.
---
Its not.
---
Lol no. Bless you - no. Random boring things like vacuum tubes and wrenches.
---
I'd use the atom shop if there were things besides skins in there.  People might crap their pants but if there were things for purchase in there like a backpack to increase carry weight, extra-large camolp.srorwge box or something that would allow you to be able to reselect all special points and perk cards, I'd throw down a little real world money.  
---
I only spent actual money on the Modern Fireplace.
---
Everything else; the light wood laminate flooring, succulents, camo combat armor paint, and grey pip-boy, were bought with atoms earned in game.
---
There's nothing else that I want, really.
---
Some variations on Radstag Hides would be cool. Like with an accompanying loose Hood that can be equipped or not.
---
I'll wait. Patientgamer.
---
All you do is post on here. You play it. So why say that? You mad?
---
Funny. A game where you have to worry about where to go, what things to loot or what buildings to enter.
---
And when you did something wrong (or something what was not expected to work this way), just write an esay to the support and apologize, and pray to the gods. Otherwise you will get banned.

Well at least they got that right. I've never seen so many crashes on an MMO in my life. At least the ones I've played anyway. Still, they definately cut corners in a lot of places. Hopefully they get thos shit fixed. A shame that an game with so much potential is having so many problems and is being managed so poorly. 
---
Part of one, anyway. Not too sure if Bethesda are planning on expanding the mine tunnel we stumbled into or are leaving it as is.
---
Adding at least one searchlight definitely helps the turrets "see" the targets more regularly. I have two, and actually have added a pair of construction lights to illuminate the desired fields of fire for my two remaining turrets. 
---
But the turrets are still woefully bad and stupid — as compared, say, to Fallout 4 turrets. They may have this at the bottom of their priority list for bug fixes — which would be a mistake! — on the theory that more responsive turrets would only help those yahoos who build turret-platforms to farm the Whitespring clubhouse. Those guys annoy me — turrets ought not to be an XP farm. But more effective turrets are indeed needed, because they're a bad joke now — *especially* given how quickly they'll eat up your camp budget!

Thats a Dev Room plan. The only levelled list it is on is the Dev Room ZWTestChest. So, if you have that plan, throw it away.

Oh fuck

I thought it was a drop so I used it

It was in a sbq body and many other have had the same thing happen to them
---
You guys have no life. Stop crying about content. They shouldnt add any content to the game until it is polished up and balanced correctly
---
I've played this game for hundreds of hours. Out of hope that everything will get smoothed out, and there actually might be DLC, I purchased some Atom. Support what you enjoy, it's a pretty simple concept.

it had nothing to do with their deaths though lmfaooo

building what??? your camp??? there is no reactivity to your choices at ALL in this game.

Or Underarmor Lead Lining.
---
Yes, it would be.
---
Perhaps. I'm not against balancing things that seem way off in terms of weight. They did that with bobby pins so no reason they couldn't be reasonable with the rifles too.
---
It does not.
---
ok thx

As soon as I log in I go check for calibrated shocks for X01. Then I check events. Then I make a govt supply drop run to help low levels. Then I farm junk for ammo.
---
After this i check if:
---
- anyone at silos (meaning a nuke launch soon)
---
- groups of 4+ players in the same area (something cool might be going on)
---
- any low levels in high level area (biting more than they can chew)
---
- workshop in need of defending (ill go there and help the owner)
---
If nothing is going on I logout.
---
Sure they are worth more

Np at all 👍

You can always find a quantum or two around the enclave bunker.
---
That's very bad idea! Dupers/Mulers will be very happy about that. Think about that, you can have a secret stash at someplace only you know. There's very little chance that other player can find it. 
---
Yeah, many of my cards are used up for reducing weight of chems, food, drink, ballistic ammo, explosives, and energy ammo.  Think I have 13 cards in all used for weight reduction, pluss have excavator armor and pocketed regular armor.  Finially at Level 50, I got all the cards I really wanted because was trying to make the game more enjoyable by being able to keep more of my stimpacs, food and drink and ammo on me while traveling around.  
---
I'm not sure if I'd prefer they change things, except maybe add more weight allowance to the camp box, because it's comes down to a trade-off, build to do more dammage or be able to carry more stuff.  I'd rather walk around with 100 stimpacks and 50 rad-aways and 50 pork and beans and 2k 5.56 rounds than do more dammage.
---
It works great. If you have a fridge at your disposal it almost becomes second nature. Plus, it's a lot less intrusive than a cooling pad.
---
Yes, go ahead and bitch about a completely valid concern. Just remember that not everyone will appreciate your insufferable shit attitude pertaining to defending a multi billion dollar company shitting into your open mouth.

Good luck in all your future gaming, looks like you’ll need it.

&gt;\-I'd like to have a cat and a dog walking around in the CAMP (immortal, of course).  
---
&gt; \-Some nice rugs.  
---
&gt;\-Is there any reason why we can't store our CAMPs in our own consoles and have it upload to the server only when we log on?  That way we could have a bigger CAMP with a bigger separate home Stash box.  Would this be too hard to implement?   
---
That's nice. I'm still gonna level any camp I come across that's planted there, same with any camp I see close to the golf club at Whitesprings.
---
I found one for 680ish a while ago at the whitespring vendor
---
Yeah its a very cool story. But there significantly better ones in other Fallouts. Imo.
---
Gotcha, my opinion still stands though. The game is a mess and people are to stubborn to admit. All these companies force half finished content down our throats for profit.

PC, Level \~400 if I combine my two. One is 187, one is 120. I have another random alt at 50 too. I stopped playing after the ..  I want to say 2nd or 3rd week? Frustrated when I heard about dupes and exploits, getting crashed a lot due to those people, etc. 
---
I still have hope, kind of holding out until we get a new game mode since IMO the current economy is completely busted due to exploiters duping. The best thing that could happen would be to either wipe everything once all known exploits are fixed, or offer a new game mode. And yeah, I'd be entirely fine with a wipe even though I'm level 400 and did nothing wrong. I just want an even playing field with no dupers.
---
Yes, they are extremely rare from there
---
You should have got it when you saw it, lol

It's the rad worm bug increasing your stats by +50%. In this case, lockpick is an integer, so it's clipped from 4.5 to 4.

PVP means maniac in 76. Lots of players just run towards you, start shooting for no reason. I hope the new server would give a proper reason for PVP, not like a weasel killing just to calm the crazy nerves. Vault dwellers shouldn't fight each other.
---
I stopped leveling at 76. I'm banking them for broken cards to get fixed and I'm at a point where shuffling cards too is much more of an annoyance than helpful

What in the hell actually happened? Is there a link to the original post?

Huh? Replied on wrong thread? If not, please elaborate.

I mean, what's the percent chance that the UFC advertisement team is a bunch of nerds into into console RPGs? Now, what's the chance they're also toxic assholes who feel the need to shit on what they personally dislike? Assuming neither of those things, the best odds are that they are a business that can simply be paid to advertise things.
---
Id like a mod that would decrease enemy respawning, for me to have a sense of progression in actually rebuilding Appallachia.
---
And of course having NPCs appear as travellers, refugees or other vault dwellers that I would designate professions to.
---
Sentinel armor is the 3rd effect, so it only appears on 3 star legendary items, which are sometimes found on 3 star legendary enemies, which spawn very rarely. They are sought after due to their power and rarity, with most going for 25k caps.
---
Rejoin previous world, means you can put anything in a container, leave the world, rejoin, it's still there. That means you can have multiple secret stash sites.
---
I know your pain. Tried to build france around my farm. At the end i just built my house with no floor in the middle and had my crops inside.
---
I believe it’s 40% ap on perforating, and 25% on the other magazines.
---
It’s kind of like surreal art at this point. He’s stuck playing this character that’s too weird to be made up but to odd to be believed...
---
Me neither. Never said that progress wasn't being made. It's just at such a slow rate that I'm worried that the Dev team is being redirected. 
---
Yeah, so do I, but that doesn't change the fact that the game is in a bad way. 
---
This happens to me with both my Excavator and my T-60 set. For some amounts of time it happened with my T-45 and T-51B sets as well. 
---
Once I thought I'd cured it for a week or so, I think I grabbed a whole new suit?
---
One violent night also spawns a 3 star legendary wendigo at the end of the event, as well as legendary ghouls.
---
What perks do you recommend investing in? I don’t use PA at all, and I’m also a stealth sniper. Level 67.
---
It's a multiplayer game, you can do that already with only 1 friend. I agree, that they need to make the life of dupers and duping in general as hard as they can, but not to the cost if basic QoL!
---
Super duper, enforcer, tormentor, glow sight and born survivor.
---
Overall perks that decrease stuff degradation and require less junk to repair are still useful.
---
If you, like me, hate being hungry and thirsty all the time, slow metabolism and dromedary are very useful.
---
MTX brings in more revenue, tbh. Whales and all that. They could have done both like AC Odyssey, but that probably wouldn't have been popular. 
---
To be fair, consoles do have keyboards. Few games support keyboard input.
---
But yeah, it's crap that you can't just type the number on PC.
---
Luck of the draw, weapon artisan and power patcher( give extra damage/ more armor when over repaired) bloody mess, ghoulish, good doggy, and starched genes.
---
Bonus tip: you can see the field of vision of all (I think?) search lights if you use Berry Mentats. It can help with placing them.
---
Mine sometimes still don't aggro until I engage the thing shooting them, though....
---
I'm not venting or anything. I enjoy the game. I was merely wondering how many people were working on the game so you could estimate how long it takes for progress to be made and especially WHY it takes so long.
---
If there's only a handful of people working on it then it probably won't speed up any time soon.
---
If there's a lot of people working on it they're probably just fighting some technical issues and the pace of progress should pick up at some point. 
---
I guess the French didn’t want you doing what you were doing-
---
Hey yea, go for it guy!  More power to you!  I predict nobody will stop you, and after the camp owner moves, nobody will care or even remember.  Win/win, yeh?

And yet both of you can't seem to walk away from it! The more you post here, the more I see how much you want to come back!
---
Ah, the old “attempt at ironic reversal”. Dude, when people talk about NPCs in the Fallout series, they’re talking about NPCs you can have meaningful interactions with, not vending machines with a couple lines of dialogue. Being pedantic and ignoring context does you no favors
---
Good idea. This would help building towns and factions.
---
Why? Fusion cores deplete in 3 minutes and are rare spawns now with no ability to transfer between toons who can even use power armour now?
---
I use it constantly and never have issues I'm not really a PVP player
---
Thats insane, I only open other peoples supply drop as I can never find mine &gt;&lt;
---
Nope.  The Atom store is fine in concept (they just need more interesting stuff in there, and set more competitive pricing for the Atoms themselves).  As it is, it can just sit there the way it is and I'd like my DLC included with my purchase price as was originally planned, thanks.
---
No, they haven't banned anyone from for getting into the uncompleted vaults. What they've banned people for doing is using some sort of 3rd party program to gain access to scripting commands (there's no console access in this game)  to get to the testing area. That's not anything anyone did by accident, and it's not anything you'd be able to use a non-hacked client to get to.
---
I have a technique that guarantees with 100% effectiveness that you will load into the same server:

I would trade all my unspent atoms for a Harold t-shirt, a Diamond City jersey (continuity be damned, it makes more sense than a princess bed), a Memory Den pod (aesthetic only), or most anything that actually has something to do with the game the Atomic Shop is for. The junk that is there is Sims-ish or incomplete.
---
I mean, a silver shroud costume and they were too lazy to move the Silver SMG skin over? What the hell....
---
Wiki says its true, but the mod is not available for me. I've prolly haven't scrapped enough of the pieces yet. Oh, I would really like to see fully upgraded leather full set vs  buttressed  marine comparison in numbers.

Base Mods:

---
Welcome to the Saltiest Place on Earth(tm)!
---
There are 3 power plants (that i know of) you can take over and each one has fusion core generators. I usually just take one, and fast travel once in a while. 
---
There are plenty of issues in Fo76 but the scarcity of power cores isn't one... 
---
I genuinely enjoyed playing the game as well! However, the game is not worth the money I paid for it at release, and its upkeep is beyond horrible for a AAA gaming studio. I've uninstalled the game until I see real content, real care being put into the game instead of haphazard updates to things that aren't problems, and breaking the game in trying to fix its real problems. It's like Bethesda doesn't care. Try playing vanilla skyrim again. It's so buggy, so boring. The only thing worth making the game playable is mods because the game is expansive but ultimately empty. The same rings true for 76, except we can't mod anything.
---
I read somewhere that Bethesda's putting Starfield on the Creation Engine; if that's the case, I'm skipping everything until they work on a new engine. I wouldn't mind a 2 week complete shutdown of FO76 to correct a lot of the issues to make it a service game worth coming back to; they could even present it as a second chance Reclamation Day.
---
The fun I had in the game did not outweigh my frustration.
---
If you're thinking of changing characters I would imagine they shouldn't be able to join the world of, essentially, somebody else. Different characters should get a new world.
---
Do you use the chat mod?
---
If its in your quest marker you shouldn't get a bounty. I haven't whenever they have popped up randomly on mine.
---
I've seen this mentioned before here but don't recall the change ever being mentioned in patch notes. Are people sure this isn't a bug?
---
A timer to reconnect is *vital* if this game is to succeed. Spending tons of resources and time taking workshops only to lose all of it 15 minutes later is fucking infuriating and a big part of why most of my friends don't play anymore. If you can't fix your problems, work around them.
---
What a load of horseshit. It is not the audiences job to believe, it is the writers job to make you believe. The audience brings their attention and desire. That's all you get. The rest is on you. 
---
Bethesda has shitty writers.
---
Emil is a limping disaster. Unoriginal, unimaginative and lacking even the most basic understanding of motivation. 
---
The other person(s) who worked on this game remain to be tested. There simply isn't enough material here to render a proper critique.
---
your lvl past 50 is nothing but point moving. nothing else. all drops cap at cap player level. which is 50. oddly some items are restricted to lvl 45.
---
I just want my 3* enemies to drop 3* loot. Is that too much to ask for?
---
For how long?
---
The effect gets shared out to EVERYTHING near you. That includes critters. That in turn seems to be causing the originating players to become unstable and get disconnected.
---
It's something impossible, i know your pain
---
Yoo, np, you started this! It's funny because based on people's reactions you should name the post "Why people refuse to acknowledge that most armor types provides less protection than leather armor?"
---
Ehh, little confession here, but for me, community itself destroyed the game. And I'm talking about ingame actions, not all the other buzz. People be duping hundreds of items, another people are buying them for real money/trading them, valuing only them over all the other items with genuine rolls. Like at this point everyone using the same gear that just wasn't meant to be collected as a set in the first place. Unyielding/sentinel, bloody weapons, all that. Everybody has it, every single piece is duped. People who run the market, the community, they are all guilty at this point. And I'm talking about this because in the market, meta armor is duped marine armor. Its weaker than Combat, its far worse than Leather. Metal also provides far better ballistic res. Like they cant even see the numbers. It's just sad. They killed all of the variety ingame. Not the devs. It can be only undone by making the particular legendary effects craftable at this point.
---
DAMN! And I thought building the FENCE was hard. An entire France must have taken CENTURIES! Those English sure were a bitch, huh? 
---
That's silly to care about fake online points.
---
Haha bet, they prolly sitting there like "oh he just rude, I dont want talk to this guy". Lmao. 
---
You are absolutely right my friend and i also played all fallouts since i came out of vault 13, in that god damn cave without any ammo and tons of rats. Anyway my problem is that i dont have purpose in game . I have allready everything i need ... Twice ... Both characters are ready for adventure that will never come beacuse all missions with holotapes that are talking to me are done. Been there done that all legit and with my beautiful unique quad explosive revolver and my trusty grognak axe that is not so much grognak for only one anymore. I love fallout universe i really hope that fallout 76 will succeed but i'm a realist also. So fix it properly or im not coming back 
---
Food can be an issue unless you have the carnivore or herbivore mutations...... other than that purified water is absurdly easy to obtain, just take a workshop or two and place a few purifiers and before you know it you'll have a hundred maybe two hundred water its crazy and that shit be healing you too so its useful in that quantity)
---
Same reason you can't revive people with a fusion core: It's the wrong item.
---
What is your build and perk card setup..... have you ever put a card into endurance, intelligence or luck?
---
Almost every vendor has had these daily from making daily cap runs
---
Think it was likely dead. New bug introduced on last patch.
---
Usually found in vendors at toxic valley or the forest good luck 
---
MARDI GRAS is almost here March 5th, maybe I should make a Faschnacht mask.
---
Because theyre diluted.
---
Yeah, I check the enclave whenever I'm there. It's a bit silly that they are the source for such important mods. If they moved those to Monster Drop it'd make much more sense.
---
As for the Normal Armor Stats, I'm not sure the stats need to stack. Just the Legendary Effects. But even if they made the Armor Effects stack, they'd just need to retune how much armor PA gives you. ~\o/~  
---
But that's not the only solution to the problem. They could easily have PA start dropping with legendary effects. 
---
[Probably disappeared, has been happening for a while.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw3dq6i8xwc&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Interested in this too, as they seem to have vanished from the game. It’s like the barn building plans all over again. 
---
You're on the wrong sub then.
---
I ended up building my garden fence against a rock face so I only had to do three sides, and I filled in one impossible gap with a guard post.
---
Did you play Dead Money? That dlc was legit intense. I couldn't bring myself to play that one. Watching my husband play through it was stressful enough, but I loved it. New Vegas has some damn good dlc. One of our faves. We were kinda bummed it was seemingly the least favored Fallout title. It helps I was from Vegas, so it was kinda funny to visit surrounding towns and locations I am familiar with but have a Fallout feel. 
---
They do with valid criticism this crap is useless tho they don’t read this nonsense drama post they don’t add to anything 
---
Nah you can connect it directly to the door. It should be the intemediary between the power supply and the door. 
---
attempting to trade anything with an atom shop logo will not appear in the trade window. dropping it will destroy the item and you will have to make it again
---
You can use a pressure plate on the inside connected to a switch on the door (the switch always stays on and the pressure plate is the intemediary) then put the code lock outside the front door and connect that to power supply and then directly to door. Let me know if im being too sperg on the explanation lol
---
I first encountered him at level 4!! Unaware of what he may do, I approached him. Safe to say, I won't be approaching him again. 
---
They want to eliminate players who afk and clear server space.... it's better when the 20%+ people who are paused and in the map are logged out to the menu than ingame (food and water are abundant and with correct perks and mutations you'll fill up on one water and one uncooked meal... when considering the other benefits of eating and drinking  I'd say its fair)
---
Spread that sheet baby
---
I shot him and he flew off. Did you kill yours? Do they drop good loot?
---
Maybe it's just me , but it triggers me when I search a PA plan because I always try to find the location in "plans" first, it seems logical, but then I have to go to PA mods, idk it feels misplaced , but still it's a nice work, it shows you've put time to do it.
---
The Bethesda fun police will never approve this.
---
Of course is does, but I don't expect any kind of lateral thinking from a bunch of people who want a story spoon fed to them by "human NPCs". If you don't think I know how the individuals in the story died after over 400 hours of playing the game, then whatever.
---
Lego Star Wars
---
Whitesprings ain't that good for exp only, I find that nuking VTU is far better yielding in terms of ghouls :P
---
I saw someone mention the traincar west of Watoga can spawn the plans. ButbI have server hopped more times than I care to admit and have not seen a single BOS plan. I finally found the heavy combat armor arms plan on the vendor, and the train car did have the officer jumpsuit. This was last night.
---
I use PA most of the time now due to being over-encumbered and needing the option to run from some enemies. I plan to switch back once I can find enough deep pocketed mods or plans for my gear.
---
i'd just farm for the plan lmao
---
Uh, it's extraordinarily easy to level up in this game.
---
Not only do you normally have well rested, cranberry items, etc to boost your XP but after the latest patch it seems some of these are even boosted by rad worms.
---
The highest XP you can get in one shot is boss monsters. Now before someone cries over scorchbeasts.... There are more than scorchbeasts in the game. Take a shotgun with enforcer to the Mirelurk Queens and Fog Crawlers that have triggered spawns in the Mire, for example. They literally fold in half to Enforcer.
---
Monster Mash still works fine in spite of people claiming it was nerfed. Queen of the Hunt is a decent one and death claws are spawned by a trigger not far from it. Spoilers: they also literally fold in half from Enforcer.
---
The more reasonable thing to do is just play the game. The one thing you'll never run out of is things to kill. Take a trip through Glassed Cavern or do any event anywhere.
---
yes and no. it doesn't stack like adding the two percentages together. There's diminishing returns.
---
This has been fixed. The underarmor is removed when the outfit is equipped, but can be immediately reequipped without further issues.
---
I want the helmet to be separate from the body.
---
i wanna see legendary power armor, even if they are just 1 star prefixes
---
It's for roleplaying a high tech Hotel California...
---
I havent even journeyed further than the Ash Heap yet at level 28 but am having a blast. I wish i could keep more items and decorate my camp with things i find rather than having to scrap but w/e. 
---
I've seen power armor with the Nuka cola paint dropped. One of my friends was selling sets. Is this a recent change?
---
the plain sack hood unfortunately not. it comes always with strap or innertube.
---
YES and its NOT worth it because its not 75%+50%, its 200 Armor - 75% SKill = 50 Armor -50% Weapon Effect = 25 Armor, there are more better ones if u have to choose :)
---
To be honest with the current weapon and armor capped at 50 they need to slow down progression alot....... It's absurd that they nerf things instead of giving better weapons, armor and harder enemies!!!
---
You can wire an indoor pressure plate directly to the power connection at the top of the door. It looks a bit janky but it runs through the door onto the power connector outside. The keypad switch should be on the outside as Majestic said and connected to the same power connection at the top of the door. Now power must be routed indoors to power the pressure plate and the outside wiring would be as normal to the keypad switch then to the door’s power connection. Actuating the pressure plate will give power long enough for you to walk through the door and then it will close behind you. 
---
omg! will have a look. :)
---
thx in advance!
---
Please no! It was like that in the beta. Pacifist just stood in the green circle while emoting, which prevented me from taking over.
---
Wah wah wah.
---
I'd go for PC , the game is at like 15€ on G2A, and I achieved to play it on a far more potato PC than yours (except it ran all low but still, smooth fps)
---
Alright Thanks :)
---
It's supposed to as hell...... This door was made by the man who put left hand scanners on the right of doors..... However asthetics aside, I use a terminal that can turn on and off the switch that controls the door (it's a pain but you have to use the terminal to close the door when leaving too)
---

I would like to have a level up function of legendary gears. You can level up your low level legendaries at bench.
---
Well, I didn't know that. Shame silos are so boring, but thanks for the tip :) 
---
It’s just hard to believe that Bethesda would let a game die like this. This isn’t some indie developer
---
I don't think that gladiator works on punching weapons like fists and the meat hook.
---
Yeah, I did all of them, and some where super cool, some just super whack. 
---
NV with all DLC might be better overall, but I think the main game (NV) upgraded with the stuff from Gun Runners Arsenal was the best in terms of fun/immersion vs time/$ spent.
---
So that’s my recommendation, even though most the other DLC was super rad as well as small tag-on adventures. 
---
Is true. But you can nuke Grafton area and get over 200 raw violet flux. I changed all my weapons back into normal chambering receivers because i was nuking grafton and whitesprings every other day for flux and the components to craft stabilised flux. I dont think my bloodied gatling gun or furious handmade really benefit that much from the prime receivers. The effort of going through all the grind for the ammo does not in any way shape or form get made worthwhile by the very small increase in damage on scorched and the sbq. Not when i can do a lead/steel and gp run in 30 min and have over 2k regular bullets made for each in about 2min. So 32 min of your time vs what...15 or 20min silo run x2 then 20 min scavenging for the raw flux and then 45 to 60min farming whitesprings. The legendaries you get there almost make it worth doing but the xp nerf kind of soured me to the whole dealio 😐
---
Are you over encombered by a large margin?
---
Train car?
---
Aslo put the keypath of powered doors on both sides.
---
I lol'd +1
---
just bind a key to water.
---
If so the game definitely has trouble linking workshops to some people's inventories especially when too much is in there and it has trouble loading into the workshop
---
because a diluted stimpack is...diluted
---
I have never been able to utilize that fence gate successfully even once. Doesn’t matter, I’d just jump over it anyway 
---
This! The entire power plants/workshop thing is broken as fuck because of d/c. 
---
Thanks for the advice. Can't say I've ever heard of the enforcer, what kind of gun is it? 
---
The train car west from the watoga station vendor, following the train tracks, found the plan for the officer suit there.
---
I don't agree simply because it means that they can't use expansion on the existing map.... The atom shop should exist and I can't possibly imagine anything in there that makes you disagree, it's not like people are buying weapons and what not.... People but skins and cosmetics, so let them spend the money.
---
You actually have a lot of time for this, so you can afford to go as slowly as you need to.
---
They're learning 😲
---
Enforcer is a perk in Agility for Shotguns that has a chance to cause a cripple when you hit something.
---
You have 7 chances to proc it with a shotgun in one trigger pull. You don't even need to be in range to do damage - just hip fire at the thing until it falls down and then beat it to death with whatever you want.
---
Good shout, however there are no plans for x01 mods, that I know of.
---
Lol i dont go for them anymore. Just pipped lvl 300 and some sneaky bush wookie is not gona fuck me over for 10 caps 😂😂😂😂😂

* **Legendary Creatures Not Dropping Legendary Loot**  
---
   * **STATUS:** We are aware of this issue and investigating for a fix.
---
So I noticed something today. When you loot a mob you can choose to hit R instead to enter the transfer screen. Most of the time the corpse will show weight in the bottom left of the transfer screen. Unlike a container, the weight on the corpse does not decrease as you loot the items. I am curious if there is some background process where the server is tracking items on the corose, but not displaying them all or actually subtracting them from the corpse.
---
Cool thanks for the tip
---
Oh my god, JC, a bomb!
---
I just craft hundreds of throwing knives and use them as much as possible. Slows down the amount of weapon repairing i have to do.
---
The food processor machine at Mama Dolce's ate my Bolstering combat armor Chest piece 
---
Yeah but no room to store 100 waters
---
Damn, that sounds sexy. Thanks for letting me know, I'll add it to the post. 
---
Yeah and there have been several apparent causes such as leaving a team, fast traveling, getting rad worms, playing the game, getting hit by sb bitch scream, claiming a workshop and several others. I have no idea why it happens but there always seems to be a trigger event for it to happen. 
---
Yeah, all the time. I timed it. It takes an hour for you thirst meter to drop from 100% to 0%, when standing still. 
---
(Food is two hours btw.)
---
It drops faster if you move around, whether walking, running, sprinting or fast traveling, but I don’t know what the modifier is or if they are different. 
---
Speed Demon makes your modifier to thirst for moving 50% worse.
---
It’s not without reason that I have 8 small water purifiers hooked up at my base. :o)
---
Also not without reason that I would LOVE to have foodstuffs and drinkables have an “Press R to pick up AND consume” option, so I didn’t need to open up my pip boy every time I’m a little thirsty and come across something drinkable, that I haven’t hotkeyed in. 
---
I agree that you shouldn't waste any resources on a workshop, as far as anthem it's not my type of game but I'll probably still end up playing it..... But yeah, workshops are temporary and if you use them alot get contactor lvl 2.... Takes 1 min to set up a few resource generators and power generators.... Then blueprint the turret setup you use (i.e. two turrets on one of those metal stair platforms under the defense tab) and place a few and then you're done.  Any aesthetics are wasted and don't use all resource deposits just take multiple workshops.

Anyone that puts this kind of work in deserves upvl votes all day mate!

On PS4/XBOX? Haven’t seen a difference on PC. 
---
It’s become tedious as fuck comparatively 
---
After I got the platinum and every perk card/gun/armor I wanted I’ve just been logging on to get atoms and messing around with my camp.
---
I've stopped playing it, I've been killed when not in pvp, lost items, weapons food. My thirst was bugged and wouldn't go up when drinking till I died. My house budget is stuck at low so I'm lucky to have a small hut. The mutations don't work properly and they have nerfed the bejesus out of loads of people's builds. However the atmosphere of the game is immense and west Virginia quite beautiful. If its cheap give it a shot but be aware of bugs! 
---
Boy, you're opening up a can o' worms on this one. There's a lot of people that are generally happy with the game and you'll probably not hear too much from them. 
---
And there's a lot of people that are generally *unhappy* with the game, particularly with Bethesda's development (or lack thereof) of the game. 
---
Taking a look at the price point and how it's dropped you can probably tell there's a generally accepted negative trend about the game. But that being said I enjoy it and plan on enjoying it more. Try not to get dragged down by the naysayers and take a personal look, you can certainly afford it now
---
I think it's great, especially if you can find a group to play with. I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of it
---
basically its a marker for a secret society thingy, cant rmember what its called, the mistress of mysteries thing
---
Really ? I'll just stick to my t51 then, thanks for the info , and sad for us :C 
---
Good luck with that
---
Honestly thow fireproof on and youre golden. Ive stood there with three all spamming their attacks nonstop and barely took any damage.
---
Clarification about "getting banned for accessing illegal regions".  
---
You entered the vault because of a bug of "horde events". Some other players installed special software so they could communicate with the game directly so that they could send a request "take me to dev room", and have this request granted. One of this is you stomping into a technical glitch by an accident. The other is breaking Terms of Services in a purposeful manner, something much more similar to participating in burglary than to stepping into SB guano. There are no chances you will be banned for this and you can rest easy.
---
Yes, searchlight help but mutants or scorched are often not detected when shooting one-bullet-at-a-time at my CAMP. It is not about distance.  Sometimes the turrets shoot the crap out of enemies while they are fleeing (and already been detected) to a far distance. I have this big for a month at least.
---
Over 40 hours farming the enclave, and found 3 jetpacks. So if you wanna buy it from someone you’ll most likely have to pay a lot more than 1k caps.
---
Maybe take the workshop and go back when you need it? You can fast travel you your workshops for free and the Charleston Landfill can give you 15+ water every few minutes you return if you place enlighten purifiers (workshops pump out more water and faster).  Basically just take a workshop that no one uses and make it your base for water, water sells for a decent amount so you can sell excess to vendors or drop it for people... Then go do some other things and by the time you've use 2-3 waters you'll have made 5 times that at your workshop just waiting for you... I feel the struggle but I've adapted to survive in this wasteland where water seems abundant:)
---
I found one so I'm good
---
Get friends to play with you, wether they’re new to the game or not.
---
I have no friends. I can assure you the game is meant to be played with a buddy or three.
---
It depends on how cheap you can get it, try and not go over 30.
---
It's abysmal quality control on Bethesda's part..... It's like they don't even play their own game
---
Vendors get all the items you sell to them if you end the trade and talk to them again.
---
Poseidon takes 10-15 min and you can even get plans for stuff you don't have yet. Just yesterday i got the letters plan.
---
You don't even have to defend/retake the place from mobs. Just spend 15 min at the start of your session taking the power plant and you'll be fine. 
---
Even more, you can plop down the resource gatherers and you have a nice source of lead/aluminium. 
---
Ah, thank you for the clarification.  :) I love this game too much to get banned!
---
At least the hand scanners have a keypad on the right to at least imply you enter a code with your right hand while holding your left to the scanner.
---
I found em in beta nothing since. Good for sneaking turrets lol 
---
You’re doing the lords work, sad that Bethesda bots are downvoting you
---
You're 10 minutes late.
---
I actually buy Bethesda games specifically for their bugs 😳
---
Congrats
---
Which is stupid when his job is literally public relations 
---
I love it, both solo and with a group. 
---
You have to work to get the plot, they dont spoon-feed it to you.  There are occasional server crashes.  If you like exploring, this map has ridiculous amounts of exploration. 
---
There are some survival mechanics, hunger,  thirst, addiction &amp; disease. You'll have to learn how to work with those, but it's not too bad. 
---
PvP is a mess, i don't reccomend it 
---
No, it’s not. If nobody bought shit from the Atom Shop, there would be no more free DLC, simple as that.
---
If you aren't a Bethesda veteran this game is not going to come naturally. It is nothing like Destiny 2.
---
It's probably best to play with at least one friend for the lower levels. You're going to feel like it's an uphill climb for a bit and then you'll be questioning how you hit the OP pedal (just like most other Bethesda titles). Don't be fooled - most mechanics are stupid even though they seem kind of complex at first (just like most other Bethesda titles).
---
The story is good, there aren't any puzzles really, and the building mechanic is hamstrung from what it was in Fallout 4.
---
That's my advice and I like the game.
---
A: This chick is just about to kill a 3* Legendary Ghoul. Drop?
---
B: Giddy Up Buttercup leg?
---
A: Nah, too good...
---
A: ....
---
B:....
---
A &amp; B in unison: Scissors!
---
*fist bump*
---
I hope not, I don’t think they do, so that means no free DLC.

Lots of the bantalk is actually fake news from guys who 'did nothing wrong' because 'its Bethesda fault that bugs are there so I have the right to ignore ToS and profit on black market selling duped pixels". Most of ban related things I heard were just attempts of finding a fan to throw shit onto.
---
And then your game disconnects.
---
I would say the game is fun but I would never on good conscience recommend a game that freezes and crashes this much. If it weren’t for that I would recommend it, even with all the glitches and bugs lol
---
I am well below carry weight...165/205
---
Yeah its strange I just put a computer outside and connect it to the switch. Now if i want the door open I use the computer to power the switch and if I want to close it I use the keypath from the inside. You can also lock you computer so they will need lvl 3 hacking to open the door. Also the keypath switch from the powerconnectors doesn't make any sence because you can turn the switch on and off without using the keypath at al ...
---
I do have 590/600 in my stash, but usually I don't have more than 400/600.
---
There's a perk card that let's you revive people with liquor
---
Equip a melee weapon. That's roughly it. ;)
---
Incisor and Martial Artist are universally good picks, but you'll need to decide on Fist or 2H. One handed is probably not the best choice.
---
Talons (if you're punching) and Twisted Muscles are both pretty great mutations, but mind the agility cost on Talons. Adrenal Reaction if you find a bloodied legendary to stack on the damage. Speed Demon is great for closing the gap.
---
There are weighted and brawling mods for armor that boost melee damage with no equivalent for ranged.
---
Punching weapons are Mole Miner Gauntlet, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Power Fist, Boxing Glove, etc.
---
2H are Super Sledge, Pickaxe, Pitchfork, etc.
---
You have to Catch that fucker with your face. Seriously I had to center up and watch it come down and move accordingly till it hit me in the forehead. Bing got it lol
---
&gt;Show don't tell,
---
Is not a rule at all but an actual [CIA conspiracy](https://www.vo) to make people less attracted to communist or socialist concepts because they feared how attractive people would find the societies it tends to result in, such as Scandinavia.
---
The best stories actually do *plenty* of telling, they just do it efficiently, in a way that keeps it engaging. Particularly in sci-fi or fantasy, if you do *no* telling you just leave the reader/viewer/player confused because these worlds are not like ours and you cannot just rely on simple assumptions about how it works, so at some point you *must* tell how something works because trying to show it succintly is an exercise in wasting time that plenty of people still won't get.
---
Community shouldnt be afraid of getting banned by stupid shit Bethesda does, it is the devs responsibility.
---
Melee should always hit harder than ranged, or have massive skills to reduce damage and close distance. Making them equals just leaves melee getting picked apart while guns hide behind range. That being said, guns require lots of hits and mobs run inheads. Maybe mobs just need an hp reduction? It waters own melees damage to be more on par in pve, but still gives the advantage if they close the gap in pvp. That competes with ranged taking fewer hits and needing less armor repair in pve. Seems fair.
---
Amazing job! Thank you!
---
If they did that then by the time it was polished they wouldn’t have any players because everyone got bored, you Neanderthal.
---
The masks won't be Atom Shop items, you are correct in that it is a timed event for March as Faschnacht typically celebrates the end of winter. Like all post-release content, it is already in the game along with all the assets required as well as the event coding itself, including voices for the Protectrons in Helvetia. It simply needs activating at Bethesda's end, I tried to trigger this myself like I have with other stuff but sadly you can't client-side as they haven't added it to the story manager yet.
---

I found one today in a locked room in Berkeley Springs. It's on the first floor of a building, in the back, locked with a terminal on the wall. In the room there is a terminal that belonged to the town doctor. The sack hood was on the desk next to the terminal.
---
It might be a random spawn that changes what it is, but it's the only one I remember seeing out like that.
---
Still Two Shot, but Anti-Armor is almost as good and Bloodied can be even better.
---
Nice! Thanks so much. 
---
Can't disagree. On one hand it is a pretty big game. On the other hand surely someone could have fixed the spelling of "missile" and "technical" by the... What are we on? 4 month mark?
---
Anyone know how to get the Metal Signs plan?
---
I've seen where the stimpak ends up getting jammed on my character.....
---
What are you doing with that carrot?
---
yeah kind of annoying when I have to leave and rejoin to get marsupial working again
---
... They're a separate narrator, referring to you. How else are they supposed to do it? Third person would be more awkward and first would be outright wrong.
---
I want to be excited but I just can't anymore. I hope you don't get banned OP!
---
What people in sub fail to realize is we’re like 10%, of the fallout fans. Were the minor that *loves*fallout. Of my six friends who bought this game so we could play together, I’m the only one who still plays. And even I find myself having a hard time to continue playing.
---
Exactly. The hardware is only as good as the software that's utilizing it. In this case it's like running dos 6 on a 9990K.
---
Balance doesn't require matching for everything else. The different weapons need their own niches. Maybe some are better for single target raged-- but terrible up close. Maybe some like melee are best up close, but require getting exposed to mob swarms or being completely ineffective at ranged. Maybe mobs need different armor types, so different guns can effect them differently. I think that is what's really missing. Maybe one  weapon group can be perked into being great at debuffing, while another can be perked into crowd control or focusing enemies on you. Weapon selection should matter more and not just be about raw dps.
---
Meh col gutsys shred you in PA too. Overpowered fuckers.
---
They aren’t weak, they’re just average as hell
---
I would think that if they where going to add NPCs that would be done in a larger patch and they would just keep adding the frame work prior to it.   
---
Then again judging by the looks of the vault I assume they are going to keep going with everyone is dead everywhere.
---
I have the T60 paint on ps4 if youre looking to buy
---
I just contracted radworms and it buffed my Excavator carryweight by +100 to a whopping 605 total. Also Adrenaline 5 now seems to boost to 90% :o
---
This has happened to me too, I fast travelled to an event in the Ash Heap and ended up in there. Could fast-travel out though after wandering around it for a bit. Others have reported this before, there must be a mis-placed event/travel marker in Vault 63 so it is still possible to end up in there through no fault of your own.
---
Thanks a lot for this great info! I will include it in the post as it ties a nice little bow on some of my hypothesis.
---
A lot of people who are pissed at the moment have still played tens or hundreds of hours of this game. They are pissed because things have not gone according to plans with updates and we have not gotten any new content yet.
---
The game itself is great, but Bethesda Austin has problems to maintain it.
---
Just because people are complaining does not mean they did not enjoy the game to a certain point. If you like exploring and the quests you can have at least +50 hours to travel trough the entire map. I think what makes one loose interest is the lack of a meaningful endgame and slow development. But until then it can be a very good game.
---
My guess is the geck was damaged by raiders during the sacking of the vault, if the log is anything to go by, and the radiation from a malfunctioning active geck plus the near endless biological material present in the mire just outside resulted in the strangler vines being born. This is even more likely because the vault is covered in them and due to the vine's apparent hive mind intelligence they have walled off the geck like a protective shield (that big wall of vines in my pictures is the door to the geck chamber) defending their source. This seems especially likely seeing as if you look on the map there are tree drawings spreading away from the vault like vines.
---
I also have a theory about the Cranberry Bog, it's possible that FEV can effect plantlife aswell as creatures. Now if you search the Westek building there is a log mentioning that FEV was entered into the nearby town of huntersvile's water supply, as such it is likely that like any water source on a mountain range that at some point the FEV was able to travel down the mountain towards the then normal Cranberry Bog. To support this if you look on the map the divide between the Bog and Mire lines up almost perfectly with Westek and Huntersville. I believe when the aggresively growing plantlife born from vault 94 crossed that stream of FEV it mutated into a new form of growth which created the almost alien looking environment of the bog not yet seen anywhere else. 
---
FEV + GECK + Cranberry fields = Cranberry Bog
---
Pics or didn't happen...and I really want to see the pics
---
What ending? The Overseers quest has no end
---
nope. 
---
fallout shelter is available now, but not 1 &amp; 2
---
Yeah you are not supposed to get hit nearly as much when you run without PA. I run a stealth build without white knight and my 200% repaired armor is good for solid 2 days of playing usually. I even shoot the ground with explosives to activate mutations/unyielding and still, no problems.
---
What main story?
---
100mbit copper coming in the house, gigabit Cisco linksys router connected to the isp's modem. Pc connected with eth cable, full gigabit connection. 12ms ping, 11.2 megabyte/sec max download speed, 5 MB/s up. And I still get disconnects. 
---
Super Sledge or Spear, martial artist, barbarian. 
---
&gt;Proof that there is still people out there when every other aspect of human civilization within the game narrative ends with 'oops, they ded' is pretty much required.
---
No, it isn't? They're all dead due to one or two *very* specific mechanisms that are entirely localised to Appalachia. California didn't have ultracite mining with nukes. If they survived 20 years after actually being hit, unlike Appalachia, you have precisely zero reason to believe they'd suddenly die off now.
---
This applies exactly the same to pretty much all your points. It's obvious everyone in Appalachia's dead; but only due to a localised mechanism. You have no reason to believe the same of elsewhere, but you do have an opportunity to stop it being the same elsewhere by stopping the scorched from spreading. That's plenty of motivation to anyone who can actually look rationally at the situation to see it.
---
That is amazing. Going to to need to get premium to at least give you silver.
---
I'm not almost certain its Radworms:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/A9vR5Mh](https://imgur.com/a/A9vR5Mh)
---
Adrenaline is 90% but if I cure Radworms before it wears off, it debuffs my damage by 30% below the baseline.
---
Some of the loot is shared between teammates. For instance, my team and I killed a bunch of super mutants. One of them had loot that a teammate took, preventing me from claiming it, so, so much for everyone getting their own loot. 
---
This doesn't always happen, and it's possible that the monster above was the area boss.
---
You're already at the level cap. Why do you want to rush levelling? After 50, it's kind of pointless beyond rounding out your build.
---
Real nature lover here!
---
Grab a friend and go to the Monster Mash event. Inside the school have your friend be killed over and over by the ghouls and just keep reviving him. That’s how I got it.
---
Are you able to craft a set of bos modded lvl 50 heavy combat armor? I'm only level 38 and wouldn't want to bother having my low level gear modded when it will end up obsolete. 
---
ive kinda given up on all that. gonna wait for more content but dear god if it isnt free then im just uninstalling the game
---
also how do you farm legendaries? literally any time I see a legendary I cant get any damage in before some lvl300 fucker oneshots them
---
I know the ones you mean and I agree 👍
---
i will pay 5oo KK if you sell me that sack hood.... please feel free to add TheSpielor (IGN)

- Stand face first into a non detailed wall (not the vault door, too complex a mesh) and go third person
---
- get out your frame
---
- hold the analogue to turn the camera left while getting out (mouse may be tricky)
---
- spam the enter button while getting out
---
- if done right your camera should spin counter clockwise and you'll immediately hop back in
---
- hope it works and if it doesn't try again
---
- if it does you'll climb in but the animation will be pushed forward so instead of getting in you'll climb through the suit and into the wall
---
- hold forward while getting in and spam jump
---
- voila you're through the wall

Time for giant Prime Mothman Boss
---
Cordon-bleu!
---
Yeah but it's clearly a bug so don't just act as lemmings. The first time is understandable,all others you're a lemming.
---
I am having a couple of bugs and I don't know where else to mention them?
---
(1) Enemies healing themselves - 
---
- I have the Healing Factor mutation which may play a part in this.
---
- If I shoot an enemy with guns (tried - Tesla Rifle, Handmade, Lever Action, 10mm), it's health will drop but then it will heal quickly afterwards. 
---
- I cannot get its health low enough quickly enough before it heals fully (e.g. when reloading gun). 
---
- If I one-shot the enemy with my Grognak's Axe, I can successfully kill it. 
---
- Enemies this happened with - Super Mutants, Scorched, Vertibirds, Flatwoods Monster
---
(2) Carry limit inconsistencies - 
---
- I regularly wear Excavator Power Armor with Calibrated Shocks on both legs. 
---
- I have 15 strength. 
---
- I have regularly seen my carry weight go as high as 550 and then drop down to 400 or so in the same play session. 
---
- I don't use any food, drinks, chems, armor, weapons, bobbleheads, magazines, etc. that affect my strength, don't have any diseases, and my armor isn't broken. Unsure of the cause of this.
---
(3) Enemies (and friendlies) randomly dying - 
---
- Often I will be walking and hear an enemy randomly die - and later find its corpse - with nothing around that could have possibly killed it. 
---
- I have even seen enemies spawn in in the air, and immediately drop to the ground dead. 
---
- This also seems to sometimes affect the Vendor bots (who will power down suddenly, go limp, and then have their health bar go back up, in a cycle). 
---
-It also happened with the bots in Vault 76. 
---
- And it happens with Murgle, the orange tabby cat in the Ash Heap near Welch (but he dies randomly and becomes a lootable corpse until he randomly respawns in a few minutes later). 
---
Thanks for the great game Bethesda! And if you have a moment...what is Murgle's back story? Does one of the devs have a cat named Murgle? I really want to know 🐈♥️
---
Yo 
---
In a lot of ways, it depends on how you are as a person and what you want out of the game more than the game itself that'll determine whether or not you'll like it.
---
There's a lot to like about the game, particularly if you like to take your time with the game and soak in the exploration and lore. However, it's a very flawed game that can get quite frustrating at time.
---
If you're more into the Destiny M.O. of looting, shooting, power levelling min-maxer, in my opinion, this game isn't for you. You'll sprint to a crawl that is the lack of end-game content.
---
If you're more the former, you'll probably enjoy it (just don't pay full price). If you're more the latter I'd either pass or give it a few months and look into it again.
---
I did the one in the emergency center for a couple of days. Sometimes there 2 and rarely even 3 legendary enemies (sometimes 3\*) but server hopping and loading screen take too long. I've just switched to WS and maw through the ghouls. I have a far better output for legendarys and now with fewer players online you get the full spawn with a new server. Yesterday I hit 50 and shortly after a max level bloddied Grognaks axe dropped. perfect.
---
Jesus what knock off fusion cores are you using son?
---
I have power user rank 2 so 60% less drain and 1 rank of full charge to reduce drain whilst sprinting, I go round almost everywhere (I risk combat) in power armour and using the jetpack. I put 10 cores in my inventory last month and I'm only down to number 8 now.
---
you mean you can’t see the Funny side?
---
Right, but sometimes you enter the event and it is all gone.
---
Isn't Poseidon lead, concrete and uranium, aswell as fusion cores? 
---
Junk just needs to be weightless and my stash amount would go down by 50%
---
I know devs like to have fun at work but I wish the two people working on Fallout 76 would focus on patching the game and creating content.

The fact that they don't have to be, at all, because everyone in Appalachia died to localised threats from localised problems that you can keep local.
---
BEHOLD! I HAVE DONE IT!

Everyone told me I was daft to build a castle in a swamp! But I built it all the same! Just to show em'!....And it sank into the swamp. So! I built a second one! And that sank into the swamp. So I built a third one! That burned down, fell over, THEN sank into the swamp, but the FOURTH ONE stayed up!

OP has Mothman in his name doesn't give Mothman feedback.
---
I think the powered doors are for a personal vault that you can build at your camp.
---
Ban is looking unlikely as I can still play my game and have not heard from Bethesda just yet. I imagine they're looking into the glitch before judgement. 
---
There's also some aluminium, near the lead deposit towards the road, past that vertibird landing pad
---
I'm actually asking this because my brother saw someone killing the Queen Solo in less than 3 minutes with a bloodied explosive automatic handmade lol
---
I have a similar issue with my base.My solution is to unplug my generator when I'm not going to be hanging around my camp/ actively defending it.
---
That seems to be their trigger. The aggro range for generators and other appliances is crazy. I've tried hiding the generators behind the world terrain and the mutants simply switch from sniping to outright assaulting the base.
---
Really because I have
---
My life is a lie!!!!
---
Making ‘Carrot Surprise’ 😊
---
except if you have Starched Genes perk equipped
---
It depends on your characters build, most likely. If you tend to die often, or often need healing, I would recommend the Vampire. In situations that you’re fine with health, would definitely recommend Two Shot, especially if you utilize sneak attacks.
---
Booo! Downvote! Anger! Football! Internet!!
---
It's not upon them taking, you're *always* in PvP if you have a workshop. It specifically tells you when you try take it yourself.
---
And I would love to reiterate to any Bethesda dev/employee watching this thread that the entire chain of events was accidental and we did not attempt to access 63 again. Just in case.
---
Yeah I can see how that would have come about...
---
Has it got rad barrels around the small pond?  
---
Sry for the million questions 
---
There's another solution - named, permanent servers.
---
When you build something at a workshop, it stays.
---
If you'll add a clan or guild system the game will unlock its full potential, turf wars, player settlements( Workshop surrounded by camps).
---
And just in case you didn't know, you might want to also get the charleston landfill workshop. Another aluminium deposit and a junk one. junk deposit can give you springs and screws.
---
That really explains everything, your reputation is "Vilified" by bethesda
---
first unequipp Starched Genes or you will never mutate
---
Since the last latch I have noticed that on some occasions alcohol will give me 67% water, but it's only supposed to be 45%. I've only noticed it since the last patch, coincidentally when everyone started noticing their water is draining faster. Makes me think there's a bug that decreases the size of the hydration bar on occasions. 
---
Good advice, I have my base planted ontop of a junk pile in the world though, it's a nice way to get bits of scraps not hugely productive though. 
---
 To me Anti armor is the best. I run full Sentinal assasin with ap refresh so arguably one of the toughest builds. 
---
Bloodied can do bigger numbers on paper but if your not getting thru my armor your not going to kill me. Keep in mind while your trying to kill me im i'm going to try to kill you. If your running bloodied (your probly half health or lower) its only a few hits from my AAE drum mag handmade and its over.
---
Now on the other end if your only hunting wanted players and run a high crit build with bloodied you could win but your chanceing things to getting crits and handmades arent meant for consistant crits. If you were talking high crit rifle build then bloodied can trump Anti armor.
---
I have a BE handmade, AAE handmade, AAE combat shotgun, AAE lever, BE lever, etc etc.   The AAE handmade is the best gun a have used so far in this patch. I switched from a full shotgun build to rifle.
---
If this guy used it, it doesn't seem fixed. 
---
Doesn't mean you have to announce it. NMS didn't have an explicit roadmap beyond "actually do the things we promised", which 76 already did. Anthem is weird for already having such detail - but OTOH means they already knew content they could have base-game and decided to hold off on, if it can come so quick.
---
so i am in berkeley springs.... looking for the house. but its a big village. :P
---
B: Yo!
---
A: What's up my dude?
---
B: This guy right here just solo dropped a nuke
---
A: oh hell no! Wait for it...
---
A:....
---
B: hes in the nuke zone, pull the plug on this sucker 
---
A:BOOM! 
---
damn, i was really hoping someone would find an ultracite jetpack mod or plan
---
It's a pretty big building near the middle of town. If you want I'm not particularly attached to the one I found. I'll make absolutely sure it doesn't have hoses and then I could give it to you if you want?
---
Fallout 76 is my escape from working on spreadsheets, so, thanks but no thanks.
---
The change is the reason I dumped all suplly requests and no longer pick them up.
---
It's shit loot unless you are a low level.
---
I heard a rumour that there were strange things happening at the asylum regarding the ghouls. 
---
They were right. I didn't see any walking dead, but I took some selfies with some immobile ghouls who weren't registering in VATS.
---
YES: WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT
---
Had trouble finding info on how they work 
---
I could come. Is this your first nuke? And whats your Psn Note: I dont have a mic
---
Sure it's simple when you don't consider testing and consequences. "Just change the number and go" but ignore:
---
Did we apply it to every type of Scorchbeast?
---
Did we apply the correct number?
---
Is this actually the rate we want? Does it work in gameplay?
---
Does it have weird consequences for the AI when they can't use this attack so much? Do they start spamming the green mist constantly instead?
---
Are there other factors in the AI influencing how often they choose to use it?
---
Questions which a mod can happily ignore and just fix if people complain, but for 76 it's already been demonstrated taking that attitude will just make people incredibly angry, as it did when they quickly nerfed all the workshop mat generators then accidentally over-nerfed the fusion core generator.
---
Ok, I will be on some tomorrow
---
VATS rifle build, and I'm usually pretty good on health. If I'm using my Dragon it's passed stealth time though lol. I can take down 2SB's at once withouth having to heal because of the Vampire. I'm going to see what it's like with the TS. 
---
The game isn't bad at all. Bugs appear to be wildly different between players.  I have dealt with almost none but apparently others deal with a ton.
---
Granted darn near every time I ask to see proof of bugs I am downvoted to hell for it. So take that into account when looking at this sub reddit. There are a lot of people that get upset when asking for proof of bugs or issues.
---
That said the level up gear system is similar to destiny.  As you level up higher versions of those weapons are found and if you have plans you can craft them.  Grind legendary mobs to earn weapons with special effects on them like ignoring 50% of enemies armor.
---
While it's not for everyone, one of its strengths is that you can customize your playing experience to your tastes: with/without power armor, stealth/sniper, melee, energy weapons... 
---
When I get bored I pick up some new toy (weapon/armor/perk) and spend some time getting to know and use it (taking out glowing ghouls with a boxing glove is supremely satisfying) and then the game feels new again. 
---
Gotta love how you get downvotes for a realistic opinion. People still have a problem admitting the games faults it seems. 
---
I had few interactions with this zetans. Last he ocured at scorchbeast queen fight and he controled her for while. Crazy thing. Once he was controling whitespring assaultron and since he is invisible while doing so, i was like "what the fuck?"
---
I mean communist societies typically suck ass to live in so feels a little unneeded.
---
Feel like you're being overly literal in regards to the expression. If I have the choice between the player experiencing the fall of the responders at thier Airport HQ (showing) vs just having a holotape and notes describe what happened (telling) then 10 times out of 10 I would have the player involved.
---
I think thier story telling devices fall so flat in this because theirs no frame or context for them. The lack of connection between the player and the world they're exploring means nothing has impact. The destruction of all the factions is just a passing curiosity instead of an emotionally rich experience and the lack of characters means we have no anchor to work off and connect with. 
---
I agree. I havnt been playing it too long but I really had low hopes as I did not enjoy 4. At all (except the pointless building). I loved NV but this is a slightly different beast and I enjoy the online survival factors. It may not be story driven, but I honestly get the overall vibe when I play that *we are* the survivors, the building is great, the world is super interesting.  Balancing needs some work but I think I’ll stick around for it.  
---
Yea first nuke, but I have the keycard ready. PSN is my reddit name :)
---
Precisely this. People seem to be ignoring that there's multiple kinds of Scorchbeast, for instance, and when they quickly went through and nerfed all the workshop structures they made a mistake of making the fusion core generator super-slow - how would we like it if they forgot Diseased Scorchbeasts, or if those became even spammier? Or if it got disabled entirely and they started using the green mist *constantly* because it's the only airborne attack they had?
---
Every change has consequences. A mod can just release another patch later and go "lol oops" and no-one cares, but Bethesda doing that makes people want to burn the building down.
---
What I've been doing is after farming prime I server hop at white springs to find one that's nuked for the heavy materials.
---
No. Unless you'd like to get banned.
---
Yeah, cause Bethesda hasn’t lied to us so far. I’m sure we’ll get lots of great free DLC. Come to think of it, the Atom Shop is “free” DLC, cause you earn Atoms. Watch them use that excuse.
---
Yeah. I'm running a full sentinel assin set too. Fighting other players is actually the only thing i do too. Thanks for your reply. 
---
Actually there are still a few players i simply cannot kill. Is there a damage bug? Because they are wearing PA. I don't know.
---
Another question. The only way to kill us is actually staggering us. Is there a chance to stop getting staggered?
---
Have you looked up the code? And ill add you in a minute
---
180level are you saying? 
---
Wasn't he using hunting rifle? :D
---
https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag
---
Precisely this. And then in this game most likely it's something as simple as:
---
"hey did the single-action stuff get implemented, for the pump action and lever action and such?"
---
"Oh yeah I remember doing that yesterday."
---
"K cool."
---
Then they miss that while they added the functionality and animations for the pump action and single-action, they forgot the lever action, and now have to record all new animations for it, test them, and only then can it be implemented. Which isn't a day's task, to redo every single animation for a gun.
---
I swear aside from the Gutsy burst spam the only issue I have with non PA is that enemies with melee weapons can often instantly kill me. I can take a missile or a barrage of assault rifle fire, but melee even in the hands of the AI is too effective.
---
Admittedly I'm running Radicool and the adrenal mutation so I often have less than 50% HP. I was clearing the main fortification at the Top of the World the other day. All the mobs were level 10 and I had just repaired my TSE Handmade and didn't want to scratch it on the trash. So I switch to a baseball bat, started clearing the upper levels when I take a swing at a mutant and notice he barely takes any damage. I quickly recognise that he's a level 68, but as I'm jumping off the rampart I get clubbed midair and downed instantly. Don't underestimate the enemies is all I can say!
---
nice! my ingame nick is TheSpielor
---
I think that this is just one of those games that you get out of it what you put into it. 
---
If you did not have fun with your current play style then maybe you should try another!
---
It is a game. I don't care if the weapons are remotely realistic. If you want realistic weapons you would need to play some kind of FPS game. What I care about is that all the guns are useful and serve some kind of purpose. Some guns I see as low level and lose effectiveness at higher levels and others need to balanced around how hard the ammo is to find or make. I don't even know how you would balance a gatling plasma against a .50 cal machine gun in a realistic way.
---
Yea got the codes
---
Ok nice
---
It's a love/hate relationship. It frustrates the living shit out of me, yet I can't stop playing.
---
Remember the patch when we had to unequip all gear before logging off? I need to get back into that habit. I've died a few times in loading screens and all I can think about is the last durability...
---
Considering it was only bobby pins and maybe one or two other things, fairly easily. Someone just had accidental changes to these things from a previous build, committed them, then QA is hardly going to be double-checking stuff like that that already got fixed, and is such an incredibly minor, hard to notice thing. It only got noticed by the community because of there being hundreds of thousands playing and sheer numbers meaning eventually *someone* highlights the bobby pins and is looking at the weight at the same time.
---
Not that often, really. While there are better weapons I would like to get, it just seems like such wasted time. They never drop for me. Even if they do and I get the most awesome gear, what do I use that gear for? Farming more legendaries?
---
Can I get in on this, it's my next mission and also first time. 
---
This is my favorite fallout game!   
---
I really like the changes to the perk/s.p.e.c.i.a.l. system in that you build your character as you go by choosing perks that will help you in the moment. 
---
You get the strengths of an rpg in a much more fluid way (and the corny jokes that made me fall in love with the series!).
---
Go away
---
Hi there! I hope you're still checking this post. I'm curious about overdrive. In game the tooltip says "+15% damage and +15% critical damage" so I'm not sure about what you're saying about allowing crits outside of VATS (perhaps it's just undocumented ?)  I'm late to the game (been playing for a couple of weeks only), so I wasn't sure of it got patched and changed since your initial post, and various webpages all say different things about overdrive, so I was hoping you could provide some insight. Thanks for any info, and I really appreciated this post as I leveled :)
---
Except you're ignoring that:
---
A) there are multiple Scorchbeasts, and you need to make sure it applied to all of them, and that they all got the same adjustment (assuming you even *want* the same adjustment on all),
---
B) these attacks get used by AI, and you have to see what the AI actually does with them now. Does that actually make them better to fight, or does it mean they start spamming green mist instead, and are constantly moving too fast for console players to hit? Or does it mean they constantly land and are piss-easy with a good melee weapon?
---
C) is it actually balanced/what we intended to do. Ties into the above, but also independent - are they now useless, or overpowered due to something else, is this actually how we want the game to work.
---
So no, it's not a breeze, if you care about getting it right. Would you call it a breeze if someone wanted an ECG monitor to just display slightly larger? Would you assume that couldn't possibly go wrong in any way?
---
I always take screen shots and report anyone with anything above initiate. :P
---
Definitely agree with this. Had this issue yesterday where I needed fusion cores and decided to take over one of the power plants. First time I took it, got 1 core and crashed when defending the first event. Some how I was still motivated to try again, second time same thing.  After that I said fuck it and stopped playing for a few hours. Eventually did it a 3rd time later that day, and finally the server was stable long enough to get a bunch of cores, but it did eventually crash as well.  
---
Are you nuking the queen? Do you need assistance?
---
I have ran across a few tough players in power armour. Guys that know what they are doing could run emergency protocols (50 percent less damge at 20 percent health) Add in dodgy, serindipity, perk to auto stim at low health and its tougher to kill them.
---
Stagering isnt the only way to kill us but i would prefer not to post all the ways to beat us (Multiple). Someone else may though lol. If you jump straight up and down you dont stagger in the air. If you have at least 2 ap refresh pieces and marsupial your ap from the jump will be full by the time you hit the ground.
---
Also make sure to run blocker to keep the melee guys in check.
---
I actually run some lower level gear with ap refresh and take the armor penalty as it is more benificial.
---
Are you looking for results like this? https://m.imgur.com/UpEndx2
---
And let's not forget all Bethesda titles feel kinda clunky and choppy. I pulled a pin on a Nuka-Grenade yesterday then my game locked up for a few seconds, eliminating any chance of survival!
---
that would be so good if it were true,
---
unfortunatly i think this is actually just re-using excisting assets they have on their engine.
---
i dont think bethesda is capable of creating such a great lore where hints are even in previous installments of the game.
---
I said in the main post, getting to level 100 is my last trophy and I'm trying to get all of the game's trophies. 
---
You unit test the engine, not gameplay. Gameplay is too uncontrolled - what if RNG, or even simple network delay means the box you're trying to get a bobby pin from, to see what their weight is, doesn't have one in when you try take it? Failed test, even if that patch was in. Then unit testing is also supposed to be from a clean slate from every test, to ensure no interaction - you want to be waiting for the game to load *and* a server to start for every single test?
---
Not to mention what if the balance of stuff gets reconsidered. Now not only do you have to change that balance in the configuration but you have to change it in the tests too, and get everyone to agree those tests should be changed.
---
These are not things you should be unit testing. Unit testing is for behaviour, not tiny balance details.
---
Top of the world train station
---
There are actually 9 tin can traps at the Top of the World. There's the 3 under the gatehouse, the 3 at the entrance to Resin's shop and there are 3 more in the building north of said shop. The ones at the entrance to Resin's shop are most commonly disarmed because of the highest player traffic. 
---
 Killing in pvp (which you asked) can be different than killing the queen. Also the queen scales to how many people are in the area. If there are only one or 2 guys its very easy to kill her.
---
1 time I bumped into an eyebot whistling along with a bunch of radrats following him. Nice Pied Piper reference. Made me chuckle. 😁
---
Well actually,
---
After would be New Vegas, so your point kind of doesn't work there with how the enclave are in that..
---
And in three the funny part is they weren't trying to be the bad guys.  Eden was a delusional supercomputer thinking that the apocalypse could be solved merely by killing all those who were remotely mutated.
---
And Autumn was actually pushing for hearts and minds, but was willing to crack a few eggs and kill a few raiders to get things done.  The problem is his forces seem to  have a hard time distinguishing what a "raider" is.  But all in all, I don't think I ever recall the enclave showing up and massacring Megaton, Tenpenny Tower, or the Republic of Dave or anything else of the like.
---
Sorry about the insanely late reply, but, just thought I'd set some facts straight.  (A lot of people also miss the fact that the BOS are the New Order, or Wolfenstein styled bad guys if you would, of Fallout 4...)
---
I hit 99 last night 😁
---
it just supressses them until you relog
---
Sweet 
---
Haha, seriously, I spent almost a whole week looking for those barn building plans in every vendor and workshop defense quest I could find before the patch.
---
Haha awesome 
---
Hope so, but we don't know what they are doing anymore or if they are just ignoring most people. 
---
Phoenix in watgoa has the raider under armor all the time :)
---
I am looking for the wetsuit plans , but cant find it on my xbox, have it on PC, it can also be shielded :) have farmer all the marin armor places for days, no go :/
---
I remember the day I said I'll make a workshop circuit.  I claimed 5 workshops culminating in the munitions factory.  5 minutes after defending it (after claiming and defending 4 others), as soon as I'm about to begin my first round to gather from all of them, boom disconnect.
---
Guess who doesn't use workshops and just farms certain locations now?
---
That is not constant and takes a lot of tweaking to get. it usually stays around 1700 damage. 
---
No thats in addition to what the shop provides
---
So how do you do it?
---
That explanation text at the bottom wrapped it all together perfectly.
---
happen'd to me once, just inside the first port of the bunker :)
---
Dont believe server hopping replenishes now.
---
Why should they leave the game when they are not doing anything the game is not designed to allow?
---
I had this happen to me with Ghoulish on and X01 PA, they were literally healing me while I was killing their spawned scorch.  5 Sb's later and I'm wondering if scorchbeasts are just broken in certain ways.
---
I got it by claiming or defending a workshop
---
It was me 🖖🏻
---
So it's a localized disaster. One that you have to stop spreading before it is too late. In a story where the running theme for every 'Find this person' quest is 'You are too late'.
---
As I said, you have no reason to believe anyone, anywhere is alive.
---
Thats not the exact concern. But yes ymmv.
---
Thank you for the tip! I got one there last night!!
---
yup happened to me  going in from the secret door in the hotel just through the decon shower.
---
ditto
---
How did you get the BE base damage so high? 
---
Nice pic 👍
---
Balls
---
Yeah, there is a grouping of the yellow rad barrels as well. Sounds like you found the spot, hope it helps!
---
the problem is most of the time you can't rejoin the server because the entire server crashed due to people using exploits 
---
I play often in a team of 2-4 and when I disconnect we all do at the same time meaning the entire server is crashing - since the server shard is now gone there is nothing to reconnect to - what we need is better protection against people using exploits since without them the server would stay online and we wouldn't be kicked
---
Or probably just a bunch of graffiti
---
Yeah i think i know the place. Got to check it out. Thanks 
---
So I have 3* in slugger, master slugger, expert slugger
---
I also have 3* in martial artist
---
Then I have radicool and solar powered
---
Nerd rage 
---
bloody mess
---
I also wear 5 pieces of unyielding armour. 
---
I am also mutated with twisted muscles, talons, speed demon, herbavour, herd mentality, plague walker, and marsupial.
---
Starched genes and class freak.
---
I am starting to mess with food, booze and drugs.
---
I had my strength up to 56 at one point, but I think that was a bug. I usually run around at 37 - 45. bare fisted I have one punched level 68 scorched ones. The other day I soloed the queen. i had my buddy just shoot her to get her to land. 
---
Thanks
---
I don't understand how they were trolling you? Sounds more like they were guardian angeling you with a Gauss Rifle.
---
Sounds like me actually lol
---
They used to be in Bethesda, but moved more than a decade (possibly two?) ago
---
The reall problem is that bethesda had so much time to fix their stuff but did nothing
---
This happens from time to time. the prompt to pick will come up but no matter how many times i hit the button, nothing happens. 
---
the problem is the entire server shard normally is going down so there is nothing to reconnect to - if you solo play you don't notice it but I play often with friends and when I disconnect suddenly (or get the waiting for server) all of us do at same time meaning it was people using exploits that got you kicked which is why this should be fixed for server stability 
---
how about you just wait till they become some new theme and then you can buy them for 15 euro a piece from the atom store ?
---
Refrigerator is most probably somewhere on the bottom of the never to do list. But have fun with your hopes and dreams. There are a few hardcore fabois and shills left populating this subreddit, and the game population has a few casuals left who don't mind the occasional inconvenience of bugs, crashes and disconnects in their few hours they might play a week, and the few hardcore who suffer through it because they still have something left to do that they enjoy before its nerfed into the ground. 
---
They know pretty well that at this point they can't fix those bugs, that's all they will never tell you this it is part of the damage control, just trying to go further with whatever the mess they have. Remember that atom shop is there for you with plenty of stuff at discount prices, pour 10$ every month and your life will be better
---
There's a weapons workbench right inside the doors, you can just take all the guns and scrap them right there
---
start a new toon? switch up your play style?
---
Only something like 96% of players of KH3 have completed the tutorial. Every game seems to have a weirdness like that that the achievement *everyone* should have there's a weird amount people didn't get - maybe 4% of people have weird network errors that prevent it from registering or something. Or maybe people on other accounts on the console start it by accident and then exit. Who knows?
---
87% is weirdly low but as another pointed out it only counts for non-BETA players, which means if anything that actually seems weirdly high to me - more people bought post-launch than I expected with the backlash, I was figuring it'd be mostly preorders from people who actually wanted this type of game and everyone else was scared off.
---
They want you to be sure that you want to go outside. Anyways have you checked atom store yet? There are plenty of stuff that can help you outside ;)
---
Seems to be the case. I have a regular sledgehammer and it has a lot of mods, maybe they didn't give Super-sledge any to make them more equal?
---
Hostile work environment??
---
started by finding fallout 1 in walmart and was hooked since 
---
honestly I really enjoy the game over all - I understand it has problems and some really frustrate me but I simply play it and if I see it being laagy I just stop playing for a bit and go play something else - I am also a big mmo player so am used to early days mmo's I feel more then most people in F76 as so I tend to be more relaxed about the bugs - and I've seen better and far worse launches then this (one stopped working 2 days after launch and didn't come back for 3 months) but I see the first year of a mmo as balance fixes (bit to far on tse into nerf land) and crash testing so I'm a bit less worried then others 
---
I don't think there is actually the B Bethesda employee at all. 
---
Furious and Anti Armor are bugged with Explosive so Bloodied
---
Seriously? Your melee weapons weigh 60% less, and you can swing them 30% faster? DOES IT STATE YOUR LIMBS SWING 30 % faster? :D im not native english speaker but i think this is not intended. Is this the classic DONT NERF MY WEAPONS ? :D
---
Can I ask what the reasoning is for the mobbing by higher level enemies? 
---
I have just repeatedly been confronted by three level 68 Super-Mutants, while all my weapons were nerfed. I am level 62.  Of course I could not run away because of the unresolved carry weight issues.  I hit these enemies at least 15 times with a level 50 grenade launcher (from 10 feet away) and a level 50 missile launcher. These weapons did only about a fifth damage to them.  Their weapons, however, ignored my level 50 Power Armour and they killed me quickly each time, using up all my over-priced Stimpacs.
---
I've found a way to survive the heavy-set glowing ghoul mobbings, though I don't understand why they have to multiply to about 25 in number when there is only one of me.  Seems a little unfair to me when I'm on my own and using nerfed weapons with each one requiring about 12 melee hits to bring it down. 
---
Is there actually reasoning behind this approach or is it just a programming issue which Bethesda are unable to resolve?
---
You know it kinda sucks how people have such vastly different experiences with this game.
---
Like I can claim as many workshops as I want (yet to fully test this) most I've had is three) and play for a good three-hours after.
---
Then there are people who have problems like this and even worse off are the people who can't even get past the log in screen.

From the fast travel point at the Watoga train station walk the the tracks straight ahead past the first set of rail cars up ahead will be a second set of cars. Go into the car with the ramp, turn right and there wil be a stack of crates on the left side of the car. The plan is usually partially visible and really easy to miss.  Sometimes its clipped through the side of the rail car so go outside the car and you will be able to grab it that way.
---
The plans aren't there all the time but when they are, they are always uncommon in the wild.
---
Precisely. And of course you merge codebases - someone else has already done it before and do it well. Don't do it again and make mistakes they already fixed, just refactor the working stuff to be compatible.
---
It will never be a polished balanced game. Even FO4 is still full of bugs and lacks polish, requiring modders to do it for Bethesda. 
---
Probably
---
It's probably been redirected from the start - onto new content that people demand, which they can't announce because A) spoilers and B) a demanding playerbase that would want this *now* when it's nowhere near done yet.
---
Good to know I’ll check it out thanks
---
Thanks, is that 30 $US or £British?
---
Yep still playing and enjoying.
---
That's quite reasonable considering those two Atom store Christmas bundles of junk were about the same price.
---
There is actually a second one, seen it a few day ago on 76Market but forgot what it was
---
I'm a solo player, unless the cat develops opposable thumbs :) I prefer solo ~no pressure that way
---
Team?
---
LOL yeah we go then working in shifts!
---
I hear they just assigned 3 more coders to the team!
---
Lol
---
Oh wait are you being serious??
---
LOL 
---
I like the exploring bit, I only play solo
---
Dead dude. 
---
If you prefer playing by yourself, then I guess it won’t really impact you, except for probably the last main quest. I wouldn’t know, I’m level 32.
---
The only friend I do play with is level 80-something and only gets fun out of destroying sections of my CAMP or killing me with a Super Sledge anyway.
---
Meh... this will probably not be a popular view, but I like the scarcity of legendary items and that a two-shot gauss rifle is a 1-2 drop per playthrough item... it makes you appreciate what you have more.
---
 I still remember killing a legendary radroach in fo4 and getting a staggering pipe pistol and being totally bummed (I thought that pipe pistols were worthless), only later to figure out that it was awesome and had amazing synergy with a luck build.
---
If legendaries were non-RNG I never would have taken a second look at it and missed out on some of my favorite gameplay. 
---
I must admit i did spend far too long following them around hoping that he'd lead them off a cliff or something but alas it seemed the route was to keep going up and down the same stretch of road.
---
Since no one else has said it, I think I will to help you get a clue.
---
You're a jerk, please take your antagonistic attitude and go away.
---
Thanks❤
---
😐
---
It should, as it would require rebuilding all the tests against a fixed RNG to establish the  alance they are hoping for along with extensive play testing, and automated unit testing.
---
In the dev room. 
---
On production servers. 
---
You can use mods, as long as they aren't cheats or give unfair advantage in pvp
---
Yeah I actually surprised so many people took the time to answer. It makes me feel a wee bit more positive about player numbers
---
You take a lot of rads actuslly. Even more now that rad x diluted cant be stacked
---
[Leave your ideas and suggestions here.](https://i.imgur.com/kIeARDY.jpg)

thank you :)
---
A few years back one of them exploded blowing the doos straight of the hinges and the heavy concrete roof lifted up 
---
A: Oh hey look Gatt's playing  
---
B: Cool, I'll just despawn all the Fusion Cores from his server...  
---
A: Lol..
---
Gatt: (When I find a Generator without a core - again!) FFS ...
---
Yeah the builds that are fine dont really need armor anyway
---
Bungie Boards at the top of every set of stairs
---
QA?
---
It's around 0 people 
---
that made me laugh, your friend is mean
---
There has to be something else going on with these. As I've gotten the objective to open on without calling it in and was able to loot it without getting a bounty.
---
Wow thats the strangest anti player logic i have seen. Wtf do you care how players spend their time. And way to jusf assume bullshit.
---
You seem to be putting more effort and are more dedicated to Fallout 76 than Bethesda does. 
---
I have had hours of uninterrupted gameplay a few times (rarely but it's great), then I take a workshop and boom, 10 minutes later disconnect.
---
*Whhhhhhyyy!!*
---
eh, I only use power armor for nuke zones or when I'm expecting a ton of angry robots. The change to White Knight hasn't made a huge difference to me.
---
Bethesda has heard your concerns, and you’ll be happy to learn they’re adjusting how the scorchbeast lands, bobby-pins are back to .1lbs, and TSE weapons now do 110% instead of the 125% which is in place of the 200% that everyone said was overpowered.
---
I’ll let him know you said that haha. 
---
Pounds :) I wouldn't pay over that amount 
---
No joke, something like this happened to me. I moved my camp to be closer to my screws/springs farm, and literally everything I own got turned into corn. My house? Corn. My power armor station? Corn. My water purifier? Shockingly enough, that one turned into deathclaw eggs....just kidding. It was corn. 
---
Oh ok I thought for sure that was $ :) thanks heaps
---
Uh yeah i would stay away from workshops
---
ORRRR it could be *their* internet connection
---
it does with the meat hook only.
---
The less real "reason" to PVP a game has, the worse the d-bag behavior.  If there's real structure and reward to PVP, there will still be trolls, but there will also be a lot of players engaging in the more structured PVP.  Furthermore, most (although not all) of the people still engaged in trollish PVP will be complete pushovers, because they're the ones who can't hack the more serious PVP scene.
---
With no structure and no reward though, people make their own "fun."
---
Thanks so much for that :) What kind of numbers are we talking playing on PC do you know? 
---
I'm sitting at 4500 or so Atoms right now, and there is barely anything appealing in the store. That's not encouraging, I have zero incentive to spend real money and likely never will at this rate.
---
I waited months for that surgical mask to become available and after all that, I hate it. I figured it would have been based on the existing mask from Nuka-World, but it's new. Too new. It's sparkling white, unbelievably so. I'd pay 300 Atoms again for a dirty version...
---
Beyond that I'm waiting for weapon and armour skins. I've bought the Hot Rod PA paints and the Slicked Oil for metal armour. I'm happy with both purchases overall. 
---
Are we the same person? I was a Destiny gal and now Fallout!
---
I started playing in January (solo), I’m 76+ hours in and hit level 40 last night. I love FO4 so I’m enjoying just wandering, waving at other players and trying to find a good spot for my camp. I’ve learnt to take others opinions on this game with a grain of salt, personally I am really enjoying myself.
---
I’m on Xbox which does have its lag/crash/disconnect issues but it’s nothing I can’t just shrug my shoulders at. I’d say if you’re keen, go for it! We can spur each other on from different platforms :)
---
Different plans I believe
---
Thanks for taking the time to put this together.
---
Mods are generally ok, so long as you stick to QoL ones.
---
However, if you're so bored, maybe give the game a rest and come back to it when the DLC drops. The most popular mods are generally QoL mods. Doesn't really add much in terms of new or interesting content.
---
I could see Bethesda getting basic service from like Comcast lol. 
---
I consider the two expansions to dishonored and DOTO, The Daud story, to be flawless games. The half life series a strong second behind that. 
---
Yeah I assumed this was because someone else had already picked it. But then last n8ght I could loot everything after my friend had already picked them.
---
So which link is which 
---
Oddly enough I bore witness to something similar. Uncanny Caverns and north of route 95a I witnessed 3 SB come flying over a mountain, and attack me. I took shelter in the outer buildings of the caverns. After about what seemed eternity, they flew south. I climbed to the top of the mountain about the cavern to get a better view. I watched in horror as these three SB made a calculated flight right to my camp. As they started to bombard it, I said "Screw you Kyle, I'm going home" and logged out.
---
It's not so much the content just the same visuals that get me, I get bored of the same thing very quickly. If there are mods to make it look different without giving me advantage that's what I'd want, bit have Bethesda actually said it's okay?
---
Wow that’s so crazy, I’m going to start looking into all of this stuff!
---
Yes Its probably a bug or partially unintended change.
---
So where's the troll bit? Sounds like a high level player was just watching your back for you.
---
I do this sometimes too but i don't see how that's trolling?!
---
I agree.  All of the legendary effects have some kind of balance to them. Instigating only work on things with full health executioner is for things below  40%. Then they have the effects that only work on one type of enemy and add 30% damage.  All the effects that add a constant damage boost to all shots and enemy types had low multipliers like the mutants effect of 10% or they require a down side like bloodied, which is still kind of OP, or berserker and junkies that need no armor or additions respectively.  The pre nerf TSE did way to much making literally all other effects pointless. Now they actually give a solid boost to damage without being to strong. They still provide a consistent damage buff to all target higher then any of the other effects.  
---
Lol after 450 hours in the game all the recent nerfs did was stop me and many others playing entirely. Doesn't really seem like the way to get people to play longer. 
---
That's different than what he said.
---
It's not a requirement for any game to have a stupid mechanic A, or stupid mechanic B.
---
there are probably millions of players (fo4 sold \~15m units)... good luck with that
---
I never said Bethesda knew what they were doing.
---
Thanks but I did
---
I’m on Xbox and yesterday set up my camp by the whitespring station, can’t say I’ve come across any issues like that. Sorry that doesn’t help! But I don’t think it’s an “everyone” issue.
---
Try coming up to *my* house and punching it, tough guy.
---
No, it's hilarious.
---
The devs believed the game would be done and ready for content updates before January. Instead they're freezing to death in a blizzard of bugs and balance issues.
---
Im reaching lol.
---
Power armor is a hindrance to my build I only use it in blast zones. It is definitely possible to not use it. 
---
You must be in Cranberry Bog, right? My CAMP is also on an island encircled by rivers at the eastern of the Cranberry Bog, so it's also protected by the game's east boundary. 
---
Armor, not power armor?
---
You'll instantly sound smarter if you never do the half wit literaLEEE thing again; your point is as literal as a Creationist and i just don't get it.
---
It's like talking to an alien being. Just stop being literal and all your problems disappear.
---
Buying an MMO with PVP everywhere to be solo? I'll never get it. I think what you like most about 76 is farming forum outrage. I'd hate it too, solo.
---
Legit can picture you being like: -stands in front of the big red button-, you'sa take's ma friend's ammunition shop, I'sa takes it's *awaay*, -boop-
---
Why is it a necessity?  
---
Has no one got a 25p selfie together? I feel like we haven't scratched the content possibility - aside from the spoon feeding stuff.
---
Lvl 46 played for around 80-90hrs. I'm fairly sure this a slower pace than most players but I'm an explorer/terminal ready type. I really enjoy taking in everything and peaking into every container. Appalachia is probably my favorite map so far in the gamebryo/creation engine.
---
Each point of a special skill will increase the benefits of that point. For Intelligence this means less words for hacking terminals, higher crafting condition, and higher scrap yield, here's the full breakdown: https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Intelligence
---
&gt;https://imgur.com/QCGspGT Nuclear reactor?!
---
Lol they've probably renamed it ultracite reactor. But yeah that's from vault expansion of F4. You could build them and they provided obsene amount of energy. I doubly we could craft it since can't use so much energy.
---
Are plans that have both price and location marked "N/A" (e.g., the X-01 mod plans) unavailable in the game? Any idea why the plans would exist if we can't get them?
---
Are plans without that designation available somewhere?
---
400 is enough to one-shot most things, would use that. Dunno about 300. Probably still except for things like Deathclaws
---
Left trigger/L2 reduces amount in quarters.
---
Left bumper/L1 reduces amount in like, eighths?
---
Speeds things up a bit.
---
Some people are jerks. 
---
But, you can just log out... so there does exist an in-game method to deal with this sort of behavior. 
---
It would be nice if they where passive.  I wish alot of the non combat perks where. I never hack or lock pick because I hate switching perks all the time
---
I fucking died at the France and replies to it
---
It's super simple. Do you organize on reddit - our MMO hub - or do you just whine about spoon fed content?
---
Pretty sure most of you have no imagination. You're using this forum wrong.
---
probably mommy/daddy issues
---
Similar, got to level 50, spawned near Charleston landfill, and capped the nearby scorched, and then I hear the cicada noise. 
---
I really wish I had caught the GT of the guys house we crashed. That loot you dropped for us was awesome! Thanks!
---
yes pleeease! we need that!
---
Hey that's pretty good! Wanna take advantage of the glitch but dunno if I should
---
Welcome to the Jungle
---
I’m afraid to open this and see how little I have acquired so far.
---
too true, 
---
if anything the game has been somwhat ruined by having to compete with all these oneshot builds and over powered stuff.
---
honestly I wish I could play solo with a mode more tailored for solo play, ive been playing this game for ages now, completed all of the story quests except for the one where you launch a nuke. I wish I could launch a nuke tbh.
---
but then what, running around in the radiation with all the enemies getting oneshot by other people. seems pointless
---
i don't use PA. I run a bloody build. I don't use any op gear. I depend on one piece of chameleon armor and a bloody lever action rifle. I do SBQ, explorations, events, and loads of pvp.
---
I never become over unencumbered and my carry weight is 250. My stash always fluctuates around 550, as I pick up the other 50 for bulking and selling to vendors.
---
I do repairs to both my weapons and armors at least once per session. While I do understand the frustration that you are talking about, I can still say that it is manageable. The QoL sux, but you could get the hang of it. I have over 12 bulks of ballistic fibre scraps, which means I find more than I consume. A full repair with whiteknight would only take me 10 scraps, while my playstyle demands that I avoid taking hits in stealth. My durability lasts pretty long. When I do repairs, I would only need perhaps to fix 2 or 3 pieces only.
---
Your gold subscription ended just like it says.
---
Thanks!
---
I play it on the occasion now
---
love this!
---
I was talking about the Brotherhood with that last comment
---
&gt;You'll instantly sound smarter if you never do the half wit literaLEEE thing again; your point is as literal as a Creationist and i just don't get it.
---
That makes absolutely no sense and has no relevance to the subject, it just sounds like a pathetic attempt to discredit my arguement by calling me stupid.
---
&gt;It's like talking to an alien being. Just stop being literal and all your problems disappear
---
Seriously. What the hell are you even trying to say? You'd sound smarter if you actually produced a solid arguement instead of going off on some tangent. If anyone is alien-like it's you, because I really can't understand what you're trying to say.
---
&gt;Buying an MMO with PVP everywhere to be solo? I'll never get it. I think what you like most about 76 is farming forum outrage. I'd hate it too, solo.
---
I don't know if I'd really consider it an MMO and PVP is hardly "everywhere". It's more of a Borderlands-esque challenge system where both parties have to consent. Sure you *can* kill someone with "slap" damage but unless they're AFK they can easily heal, run away, or just log off. PvP is definitely not a main focus of this game.
---
I prefer playing solo. I can take my time, fully enjoy the story and the world. Saying the equivalent of "ur so stoopid, play in team leik evy1 else" is ridiculous. Either solo play is allowed, and it should be balanced to be feasible, or it's not and everyone who went in being told they can still play solo needs a full refund immediately.
---
As a native German myself I actually have never heard of "Fassnacht", only of "Fastnacht", but then again , this might be the regional variant, I'm a Franconian.
---
But yes, it did hurt very deeply seeing "Faschnacht". 
---
Marsupial and bird bones are great 
---
Speed demon is awesome
---
Healing factor is nice
---
Stay away from heard mentality and empathy or what ever it's called. And I dont think egg head has much of a use.
---
If you max out class freak all the negative are cut by 75% so it makes most mutations good with little down side. Strange in numbers also is fun if your in a group 
---
I didn't waste points in Class Freak. I chose mutations with minimal, irrelevant to no down sides. Marsupial, Speed Demon, Adrenal Reaction. Stuff like that. I would have taken Healing also but I like chems and stimpacks aren't a problem with Chemist and Super Duper, water and food.
---
sneak melee/snipe those robots, same some ammo!
---
Is i worth it atm? No. Hell no. Treat yourself and buy a game which is actually good - a.k.a not 76.
---
1 Kill mole miners.
---
2 Take their shotguns. 
---
3 Scrap it. 
---
4 ???
---
5 You are fantastic.
---
Playing Anthem gave me an insight; 25 players is possibly too ambitious. WoW manages it with carefully broken down instances but there is something about our loot and crafting and the constant transferring of items that is creating too much data to handle.
---
Every time you create a workshop all the resources and extractors are being monitored and possibly even enemy attacks.
---
Add a Queen - or any event - and the data flow increases even more.
---
I love 76 for being ambitious; not interested in Anthem because of its lack of the same. I'd gladly choose vision over mediocrity.
---
How long can loot persist for? Might be worth testing - kill an enemy, wait for an hour on same spot, is loot still there?
---
There is no other title that attempted to do this much stuff: multiplayer, PVP, crafting, building. They could create area templates, allow for mass crafting, limit loot spawns, and even eliminate 100 junk and random items but i don't think our current technology can handle this game without massive server upgrades.
---
Someone will probably down vote this because it's not the usual idiot meme "durr hurr Bethesda sucks." If you don't know what to do with 25p you don't get it.
---
I see post about griefers on here all the time. Are they really that big of a problem?  I have had next to no run ins with any except may two instances and I dont know if I would have called it griefing 
---
You're certainly not the only one. I play FO76 nearly everyday, at least for a bit. It's like some kind of addiction that you can't pull yourself away from and I mean Bethesda games in general. I have played them for so long that I keep playing them over and over.
---
Even so, FO76 has rubbed me raw in so many ways that I keep telling myself that I am going to stop playing it. But I don't. It really does have some fun elements to it but due to some bad planning, the devs really dropped the ball on its launch. Of course, many of its biggest flaws can or likely will be addressed so who knows what it'll be like in the future.
---
Oh, thought you meant the Enclave, then yeah, your comment totally rings true on that one.
---
Maxon brotherhood is pretty cool, just wish they didn't seem like they were New Order rejects ported from Wolfenstein into Fallout 4.
---
You're welcome.
---
while what you say is 100% true...but he still lost half his CAMP...I hate the fact that we people are literally been driven out of the game not to be grief'd. just does not sit right with me.
---
i was done in 2 weeks, it's a miracle you found something to do for so long
---
I've scraped a lot of shotguns and never got the plans. What are the odds to get it that way? 
---
To be fair it’s believable. I don’t know jack about programming but I can understand why things would cause problems. Yesterday was just awful. 
---
We're you watching me play cause this just happened to me yesterday outside of whitespring.
---
I really hate her voice. I wish I never started her stupid quest. Anytime I try to go talk to her, there’s not another step. Every time I start a game for the past few weeks, I hear her voice. I regret helping her. 
---
I built a fence around the perimeter of my home but it took me far too long to do it. They need to fix this shit 
---
This is also why once you get the Class Freak perk, it makes sense to get all the special adding perks, regardless of your build.  For Egg Head you're essentially trading -5 carryweight, -5% melee damage, -5 HP, and +5% AP Drain for +30% crafting bonus and \~+15% scrap yield.  (And I think the losses in Endurance and Strength are even lower than 5)
---
it's still annoying that they're adding ways to get Wanted that were completely safe to do before.
---
Oh, that’s why it was empty when I went in... it was already looted!
---
They are not a problem, I have close to 500 hours in this game and have only ran into true griefers once. What's usually the case is, someone tried to pvp them. I'll give you an example. Just last night, me and someone else was going for the same workshop. I fired a shot into them,  they returned fire. We go at it for a few, I ended up killing them and claiming the workshop. Now, o dis not take their junk, I did not spawn camp and kill them over and over, but I got a charming message saying "all griefing scum like me should be banned from fo76" and if bet that 95% of the "griefer" posts on here are something similar. Single player gamers was not ready for an online multiplayer game.
---
I wish I could mute her. I regret starting her mission. 
---
https://youtu.be/VpzPUmfv960 this
---
Just picked up my tse smg last nite! Added a couple machine gun perk cards i had from the start of the game and this thing is sick! So much fun! Plus i literally have 1000's of 10mm rounds!
---
bud, you made a claim that bugs are bullshit, the onus is on you to prove those bugs are bullshit.  and again, I don't have to go anywhere, I haven't fucking "flooded" anything, asshole, I am here waiting, hoping, the game gets better.
---
Well, you’re hired for job! 
---
bruh, if you think they never planned to release lunchboxes as lootboxes you are fucking delusional, period, end of story.
---
This has been my experience too. The group I play 76 with has a good time. We run around and try to help people, new players mainly but just about anyone on the map may be a target for us to come and try to have fun with. 
---
That's what I figured.  Last night my group went for a 400 cap bounty that was close by. Turned out he had no caps and had friends waiting to ambush anyone that took him out. I assume the thought they could get alot of caps that way however they didn't fair well against us lol. They kept coming for revenge so once we stopped getting caps from killing them we blocked them and moved out. Only people I would say that tried to grief me where some fools who tried to kill me in a nuke zone and I beat them. 20 min later they are at my base and trying to destroy it so I just move it.
---
Thank you! 
---
Same thing happened to me. It was actually the game itself that caused it. I spoke with xbox cust service and they confirmed my gold was still active. I just restarted everything and got back on fine. 
---
I’ve actually got a capture of this happening somewhere else.
---
It followed a small path across the room, through the wall.... Then suddenly disappeared and reappeared back where he started to do it all over again.
---
I agree literal means stupid.
---
Everyone hates 76 solo it's boring.
---
Gotta agree I love it. There's bugs and problems but overall it doesn't stop me from having fun.  Being able to play a fallout game with friends &amp; other people is amazing.
---
I was so disappointed by elder scrolls online - it was a decent MMO but a crappy elder scrolls game.  I really hope they drop something like this a year or two after elder scrolls VI.
---
I don't have tormentor and this happened to me in the golf shop as well. My ghoul also just stood there snarling and waving back and forth but he as well was a corpse.
---
Pretty sure most of the 76 hate posts are from solo players. Even i would be disatisfied. I love this game because it is ambitious to combine PVP, building, crafting, survival and i want to do it all at once.
---
Imagining and organizing 25 players and interacting with all this freedom seems to be the whole point.
---
that was something you could pay for in the atom shop?  yup, credibility gone...
---
Signs and letters plan do include neons. They are also usually expensive
---
it doesn't feel like it even rises to the level of easter egg, it seems like it's just "fallout 4 had a building with faces n it and they made this game by opening the map editor and using fallout 4 assets" so at some point someone used the faces as set dressing but they are not meant to be assets you look at closely or from angles that weren't shown in fallout 4 so they look weird. 
---
Don't...
---
undeserved?  if the game launched in the state it's in now, maybe it would be undeserved, if the game was in BETA until now, maybe it would be undeserved, if the bags were canvas from the start, maybe it would be undeserved, but none of that is the case, so deserved it is...
---
I like the idea
---
I get much weaker and heavier in PA due to all the Perks which are non PA related and Effects from regular Armor like Vanguard n Weight Reduction Effects. Basically using it only for SBQ's runs.
---
Woah dude stop being so ***T O X I C***
---
Neither, it's strange in numbers after the other player disconnects from your team. You are then in a team with 0 other people, and this bugs out to reduce the positive bonus to 0. Go into the social menu, over to team, and leave it.
---
I think he means plans to craft the gun itself.
---
server lags, you click twice, because it didn't go the first time then the item under the item you are clicking goes in too. 
---
If it makes you feel better: I've been playing since beta, and it's still my first character.
---
That's a great idea.  I think that i only have a couple more to get having 2 100+ characters.  I hope lol.
---
Wow, players are such a good replacement for NPCs. Thanks Todd!
---
Literally the only time I ever went wanted. Then I played 2 days without anyone claiming the bounty. I was so confused when someone started shooting at me, while I was shopping at Greg's. I ran away, before I realised it's  because of the bounty. Stopped, died and spawned back inat the train station. Waved at the player that killed me, he responded with the heart emote. PvP for casuals in a nutshell.
---
Starched genes only affects radaway, not rad-X. Rad-X suppresses the effects temporarily.
---
Do you have multiple graphics cards, for example, an CPU-integrated one and a dedicated one? If you are on Windows 10, you may have to set the target graphics card \*in Windows itself\*: Desktop context menu &gt; Screen settings &gt; Graphics settings, then locate Fallout76.exe and set it to the high-performance card.
---
I'm sure it has been posted before. Maybe they will listen if enough post it. I have my doubts that they will. Too busy on damage control to do anything new. 
---
Yes, noticed it too.  I used to boil 60x of Dirty Water for 30x boiled and craft 30x blackberry juice.  Now I do 60x and then it lasts long enough between camp trips.  Also, I have the Lead Belly perk maxed, so at least I can drink dirty water if needed.  It's one of the reasons why I put my camp right next to a stream with a dock near water level.  Saves a ton of running around to get water.  
---
I wish that they had an option to craft with purified water like they do with boiled water.  Of course, then no one would use boiled water except when first starting out.
---
Guys, the developers built the game, they don't ban people or make executive decisions. A lot of hate here towards "the devs", but please direct that hate towards the publishers, marketing, investors, and CEO - or at least be aware that when you say "the devs", those people are who you mean.
---
Sincerely, a developer
---
Someone smashed up my radiation shower and it totally bummed me out (and was a pain to repair)... But that was the goal of the ahole who did it. I got over it eventually.
---
I realize that I am rationalizing here but now I see the type of players as random raider encounters that terrified me from fo2 and part of the game, unfortunately.
---
Wait wait.. I got some experience on this now that i had all possible pets. It takes 10% of budget,just like a turret.
---
Yes i also had the bug of 10% stored "nothing",when they killed my deathclaw. But the bug corrected itself when i tamed another deathclaw( took a week to find it). 
---
Also bethesda already took notice of the bug and it will be fixed soon.
---
So op try and grab another identical pet,then change server and it'll be good.
---
Umm, you know the keypad of the powered gates is on the wrong side, don't you?  
---
To use it properly, I have to have that wall with the brick on the inside and the white part of the wall outside. It looks weird.  
---
And please make a version of the powered gates for the metal walls too.
---
It might actually be a windows 10 glitch...   Windows does in fact get confused from time to time when a system has multiple monitors and then has one only, or vice versa.   You may want to check things like device manager or display properties (right click desktop) to make sure its not confused and possibly has a ghost entry for your former 1080 monitor.
---
Also, don't know whether you use Nvidia or AMD, but they both also can get confused.  I have both on my desktop (2 different systems) and they both can get stale/ghost entries or primary display assignments.   My AMD machine will occasionally lose its mind when I have multiple monitors attached, especially if I use the Windows monitor management via display properties.
---
My Nvidia machine will sometimes have a black screen when I unplug the second monitor, and I have to safe boot into windows to fix it.
---
I suspect it has nothing to do with Fallout, but rather, Windows and the GPU drivers
---
I made it up to 4 once and my team mate had 2.
---
   
---
It was fun, until some higher levels took one of them and we then wasted all our ammo trying to drive them out... we did eventually, but it was late and we had to call it a night shortly after.
---
Worth every bullet.
---
Agree on bans (even lifetime if you ask me) and yes, exploiting might have an impact, but do you suggest that every crash happens due to exploiters? It happens way too often and frequently for that being the case.
---
Sorry that my 1 word reply linking you to a Dev article was so hurtful to you. Hearing "no" is toxic to you.
---
Events are a good way. Also get a hazmat suit and farm white spring when a nuke hits
---
Ha! I had a lvl 2 neighbor the other day; went over to give him some goodies and general friendly welcome. He saw me, picked up the paper bag, went into his shack and closed the door. OK. Me back to my (rather hidden) camp, and a minute later, there he was, picking a fist-fight with my one turret :-). So I showed myself, stood between him and the turret, and he ran off, then logged off. Oh. Boy. Scary wasteland!
---
If you’re on Xbox I have a tse and executioner explosive smg
---
Thanks alot my friend!!!! Any set locations for a haz. Suit? 
---
Team up (the solution to 99% of posts on this forum), level Charisma with Inspiration perk, nuke zone farming around Whitespring.

I came across a 1 star legendary anti-armor black powder pistol that I carry around just for SBs with my melee/pistol guy. It's pretty effective, around 260 damage I think with perks. I'd use it more often but the ammo is too heavy, although the gun itself is very light. Not sure if the legendary effect is adding a whole lot, but that's a lot of damage for a pistol and basically the only gun I have that's useful at all against them.
---
Head NW of the Vault. Fairly easy enemies and locations to discover for XP
---
You can get a prototype from a quest that has no lvl requirements but I dont remember the quest. Can probably google it
---
Blocking does nothing to the harassers. I had a group of 4 constantly harassing my team. I tried to block them, but it didn’t help... nothing helped. They wouldn’t leave us alone and kept taking my junk in a nuke zone. Blocking didn’t help one bit. 
---
Just blueprint in sections. Foundations, 1st floor, 2nd floor, roof.
---
They will all snap onto each other. Only the foundation becomes the thing you have to play with as that interacts with the environment/floor.
---
Handmade has lower damage per shot then the hunting rifle that's why. Also hunting rifle caps out at lv 50. 
---
It also has a Heavy Rocket mod but the only place I've seen it is on All Rise so I don't know if it's available elsewhere.
---
Wow, at first I thought those were in-game screen shots...  I didn’t know that was a real place, that’s awesome
---
Not the only one, and I average at least one crash and two disconnects per session. Still loving the game. 
---
Yes, they are instanced to you. Sometimes they will bug out and show the plant even if you've already picked it up in the time limit, though. It started happening with the last patch when they added instanced timers to Mothman Eggs.
---
Thanks alot, also as far as having a 600lb weight limit for my camp....... thats a current thing the devs. Are trying to raise up rite?  One of my biggest challenges is at level 15 my camps weight is maxed out , and im already trying everything i know to keep the lbs. down...
---
Not at all, the only one, I enjoy the game as well, faults and all. 
---
I don’t think this list is totally accurate anymore with the changes to vendors.  For example, Grafton used to be the place to buy BOS plans but it doesn’t carry anything anymore does it?

The daily karma farm take 'em to the front page, boys!

Well there are lots of different glitches. If I were to build indestructible blockade on some of game elements to spoil the gameplay for others, that could be considered exploiting. Instead, I used them to create something I believe is cool, and does not cause any troubles to anyone. I don't believe it could be considered bad. There is no advantage here, I don't attack the server to allow me break something, I don't influence the economy anyhow, I just place the pieces as they fit. This cannot be compared to circumventing slap damage with duped aid items or duping itself. Also, I seen Bethesda employees commenting under some of glitched camp pictures and they were like 'amazing, good job'. I think expressing creativity in the CAMP engine is a very cool aspect of this game.
---
Auto correct at its finest. 
---
Max sneak and escape artist are the keys. With that, even if discovered you can sprint away a bit and hide again to lose enemies. I also use each rifle damage perk first rank, max rifle armor penetration perk, covert ops, etc. to one-shot most things with a good lever action. Lone Wanderer 3 is good, and finally things like four leaf clover and better crits with high luck keep me critting often.
---
Stealth *and* crit were nerfed pretty hard in the last patch, without any notes about it, but it's still relatively effective if you're patient.
---
I did this except it was when the player was stood right in front of me. He took offense to this (even though didn’t actually hit him) and started attacking me 🤷‍♀️ 
---
Strange.  
---
Super mutants. They have a higher base exp than scorched do. Plus they’ll give you gunpowder and caps, the former needed for replenishing ammo. 
---
I understand that, but a legendary weapon doing 135 dmg and a non legendary doing 139 doesn't make sense to me, I guess I have to get over the fact that tse was op!
---
He could have been spamming a whole lot of stealth boys, but for the time we fought, counting when he came back at a different part of the map, that would have been a huge amount of stealth boys.  He could have duped them I suppose.
---
Don't forget to sleep and find an instrument to play for the well rested and tuned  xp bonus.
---
Stealth boy? Or glitch maybe you can cmget stealth boys to last a long time with a perk
---
...and my (Grognak's) Axe!
---
The vegan one is terrible
---
There is a perk that keeps you in stealth while moving in agility 
---
Checked this after you suggestion, and it was defaulted to my graphics card, so that does not seem to be the issue. Thanks though!
---
I found mine on 2 diff characters (I’m pretty sure) in the editor’s office at the Charleston Herald.
---
No, there is a skillcard that quadruples the time stealth boys last.  And with MARKIII u may stay around 25 minutes in stealth 
---
Double checked everything you suggested, and there does not seem to be any ghost entries as you're suggesting. Only weird thing i noticed was that in device manager, my monitor is called "General PnP-monitor" or something equivalent (my Windows is not set to English).
---
Unrealistic expectations? Bethesda is so fucking lazy and incompetent, it's a complete piss-take. The scorchbeast queen is literally a re-skinned dragon from skyrim (not even kidding, they didn't even bother to change the fucking code - it still reads as dragon in the code), there were bugs in 76 from all their previous games - including Skyrim, Fallout 4 and even fucking Morrowind! Let me repeat that. There are bugs which were in 76 which were in M.O.R.R.O.W.I.N.D.
---
Bethesda asset flipped a tonne of stuff from Fallout 4, the shooting mechanics are bloody awful, the ai is like the video game version of Simple Jack from Tropic Thunder, there's no bloody story-line (no, I don't count holotapes an actual legit story-line), there's no human NPC's which makes the game empty, and I haven't even begun to touch on the constant disconnecting from the server or the myriad of other stupid bugs.
---
The **only** people at Bethesda who seemed to give two fucking shits about this game were the people who created the world - even if a lot of assets are re-used, at least Appalachia itself is diverse in environments. But that's it.
---
is this really what you think "trying their best" looks like? If this is what "trying their best" looks like to you, then you're completely high. I recommend that you stop snorting crack off the toilet seat.
---
Herbivore is by far better than carnivore. Soups refill food and water whereas meat only ever does food. You have to kill for meat, veggies are easily found in the wild or farmed.

Just out of curiosity why stay away from herd mentality?  You a solo player? I'm always teamed up and mmmm +2 to all stats is yummy

That looks inspired by Firefly...and I love it!  I don't have the patience for that kind of thing, but good job!

I move that hence-forth any use of the word "fence" should be substituted for "France". lol
---
I still use my hunting rifle for distance shooting and handmade for up close and personal because hunting rifle's follow up shots are too slow and the need to reload after 6 shots takes too long.  So in my case any buff to the handmade would be awesome.
---
It’s alright, dude, try Red Dead 2 and never look back at Fallout 76 haha

I stopped playing after spending 3 hours trying to figure out what to do with the ever duplicating, unstoppable corn / tatos / random shit on my CAMP. I tried relocating and deconstructing the things in my inventory but they just kept cloning themselves. Around this time the servers kept disconnecting me as well, I had to keep rejoining my friends' world and every time I got logged out they again would multiply in inventory so I couldn't do anything. Then the patch came out and said it was an "exploit", like no trust me I didn't want 2,000+ lbs worth of useless corn in my stash, and I dropped most of it, sold some to vendors, and uninstalled. I could deal with Scorchbeast queen not giving loot, disconnecting and having to deal with all the other bugs. But really the inventory management was already a chore and then they go and say it was an "exploit" when their coding for the CAMP was broken as well &amp; duplicating items by itself.
---
I think it stands to reason that you should automatically give up Pacifist if you try to steal control of a Workshop, and likewise, the current owner shouldn't be able to retain control by just standing in the circle (they either have to fight back, or let them have it).  At least then, a battle requires some degree of consent, rather than the aggressor being able to seize control *and* kill you.
---
Another noob here, getting frustrated at the same point. Switched to the Mayor of Grafton stuff which were instantly more level-appropriate) and made it from 15 to level 20 in a few fun hours. Also found the first set of level 15 power armor in Clarksburg instead of the level 45 stuff I'd been finding before.
---
I do know he was not wearing power armor.  He became visible when we stopped seeking revenge.
---
Ok... stupid question..... gunpowder...... used to make ammo? How exactly ?
---
Like the Legendary Mutant who survived the "humans in tin cans carnage at Harper Ferry" said...   "run away, run awayyyyyyy"....   grin...
---
Do you have a recommended level for doing this quest? I've started a new build and want to go in this direction but want am curious as to when to do this so I get the items at a level that will make this build viable at +50 level.
---
Hello fellow fo76 redditor
---
Its great in groups but sometimes you may get stuck solo. Idk I just dont want to have to deal with a negative across the board when not in a group.  I already loss alot of stats when I have to play solo because strange in numbers dont work solo lol
---
The Speed demon and marsupial combo is standard. It’s easy to work around the extra thirst/hunger by stacking herbivore. 
---
Herbivore is by far better than carnivore. Soups refill food and water whereas meat only ever does food. You have to kill for meat, veggies are easily found in the wild or farmed along with boiled water. 
---
Grounded is also great. Energy weapons are awful right now so you shouldn’t bother with them, so getting the energy DR is solid. 
---
I was contemplating Scaly Skin, but I feel like class freak would then be required, and negate the use of speed demon. I may be a tank build but I use PA so Scaly isn’t needed
---
That being said, don’t waste points on Class freak. Most of the mutations apart from these are situational or build based, so you’ll be fine. My friend is a stealth sniper with almost no strength. They are constantly over encumbered, but that’s what Excavator PA is for (traveling)
---
So yeah. Your build will be infinitely better with another 3 perks vs what you lose with class freak
---
Hope this helps!
---
If it is fissure site prime, the Customer Service manual stipulates that they must wait until the SBQ is almost dead before disconnecting the player.
---
That's why any time there's someone at an area I want to clear, I just log out and back on to get the place all to myself.  And I never take a workshop if there's someone in the area.  Otherwise, you could get fights over the workshop, which is just fine but people should expect that.
---
It's fucking hilarious. The legendary super mutant warlord runs away screaming retreat like a little girl whilst his friends stay to fight and die with honour. 
---
Guess that's why he's legendary, he's telling fibs about his heroic feats of survival to all his buddies.
---
Gunpowder, lead, and steel at a Tinkerers workbench makes ammo. Just be careful because it comes fast, and if you put your camp on a lead vein like me, you’ll be swimming in ammo. 
---
Gunpowder is very heavy believe it or not, so it will weigh you down fast
---
Fast travel target for camps
---
Fix the power armor HUD/compass
---
Did you loot those remains?
---
Lol. Think you can get it from mirelurks. Trying the lake or pond by Lewis burg station. Cant think of the name
---
What is this perk you speak of?
---
'Deep Dive' is a term used when someone has no idea how to fix something and wants to palm you off with the suggestion that something meaningful is going to be done.  Heard it in a lot of meetings. 
---
Yea, it is...
---
That’s the enclave side story. The main story is the overseers journey 
---
Legendary crafting, if you chose the swappable only mod types, rather than craftable/etc then you could swap as you saw fit... sometimes with rather unusual outcomes.
---
I think it's escape artist
---
Correction: You know your fanbase is full of desperate drama-mongers with a pathological need to make mountains out of mole rat hills when...
---
There are spots that are consistently stocked with enemies to farm so you aren't stuck exploring. For ex. I'm a melee build and have more glowing meat steaks than I know what to do with bc of the glowing more miners. 1 shotting them isn't exactly hard
---
Cool ! Thanks for the tip brother, its not so much frustration , so much as its this....... i usually will sink about 2 to 3 hours per gameplay, in fallout 4 this was enough time to rack up levels and weapons much faster i feel, as i said , i played them all, and even new Vegas, which they snagged some stuff from , was easier to store your late game weapons and armor WITHOUT MAXING OUT THE CAMP LIMIT lol thats the worst part haha 😂
---
Indeed. 
---
I know that is why I provided the video, well 7 seconds of video converted to a GIF. Still crazy and the other part is 2  of those were 2* and 2 were 3*.
---
Nope, the "I am become death" quest to launch a nuke is the part of the main story, its even listed as a "main quest" while the Overseers Quest is side.
---
Escape artists only puts you back into caution. It dont work for pvp. I'm a stealth sniper build . Though I missed a perk lol
---
I heard and followed this good advise early on ... sell that high level stuff unless it’s stared unique stuff or only a couple levels away.  It’s just taking up your much needed space for more relevant stuff at your level.  High level gear comes quickly as you level.  And enjoy the quests as they are likely the quickest way to consistently advance alone.
---
Thx.Gonna try asap.
---
Balance requires competitive options. At the moment they're is no competitive edge. Ranged is limited to bullet dropping damage  that makes sniping a hassle because like melee it requires for you to be closer and within range for the enemy, however your main stat block doesn't have a perk to reduce melee damage.
---
Sure split the builds into niches but don't expect me to accept melee staying at the top.
---
The fact you can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger and you have 20 rounds before you need to reload is why.
---
FWIW, my 2 cents....   Also a solo PC player
---
I'm probably 500 hours in to FO 76, with 3 different characters since the beta.  I also played Destiny 2 for a while, but it became shallow eventually, although I did enjoy the pace of gameplay.     I'm no fan boy of any video game  (or anything actually).  They are simply for entertainment as far as I'm concerned, and not a religion.   I did enjoy all of the Fallout games (back to 2, never played the first).  FO 76 has been maligned by plenty of people, but its still Fallout at heart.   The game is super complex in that there are tons of things to do, tons of missions, events, random occurrences, and bizarre encounters.   One thing about the Bethesda Fallout games is that they are what you make of them....   characters, missions, playstyles, weapons, you can pretty much replay them and they are much different each time, so for that, they are basically enjoyable.
---
There are plenty of people who played the game to level 100-200, and still complain about it all the time.  There are plenty you psychotic Youtubers who spend hours and hours making videos about how horrible the game is, but you see them with hundreds of hours in gameplay (not kidding).   The hate is just bonkers, its just a video game.  People still hate on Fallout 4, but have 3000 hours in the game.....   the internet is insanely nuts.
---
Personally, I'm enjoying the solitude the game offers playing solo.  Its quiet and not frenetic the way Destiny 2 is.  The multiplayer is mostly useless actually.  It never needed to happen, which is what most people ranted and raved about in the beginning.  I never really play multiplayer games as I'm a grown up, have a job and a family, and can only play when spare time allows.   Although I did meet a few really nice players here in the game.   But the multiplayer is more of a nuisance than anything else, especially when some 14 year old living in his moms basement decides to grief you, which happens much less frequently now than it did in the first couple of months.   In all honesty, the part of the multiplayer that I've been enjoying is helping newer players when they are getting massacred by enemies.  I go over, help them kill the enemies, wave goodbye, and am gone.  Its actually fairly fun and non committal.
---
No, its not really "that bad".   Not at all.  Its pretty decent actually, which is why this subreddit is so active.  Yes, there are frustrating things.  Yes, there are bugs, and Yes, sometimes you scratch your head and think "why did they do that".   But the game is pretty deep, with a ton to do.    In each of my 3 playthroughs (on number 3 now), I discovered a ton of new things I missed before, found new locations, weapons, even new story missions.    The map is incredible, huge and diverse.  Other than the first Stalker game, and possibly the full Witcher 3, I can't remember anything like it.  
---
Bethesda has been pretty good about fixing things too.   Nope, its not perfect.  There are definitely disconnects, crashes, and lag.  But lots of online games have exactly the same problems.  They've been fixing balance problems, and basic gameplay problems too.  Some weapons still suck (energy weapons as an example), which makes no sense to long time Fallout players.  But overall, there's a ton of fun to be had.
---
All in all, for the price it can be had for at most online game key vendors, you really can't go wrong.  
---
Top of the world, and also the trader at pleasant valley I believe he them 
---
You are in a deserted world, and running around CONSTANTLY, fighting and getting wounded... you expect to take a drink of water once during the day???? Come on dude....
---
It can, but I probably scrapped five of these before I learned the plans.  Scrapping is the only way to learn stuff for "free", but you don't get a new plan on every scrap. I'm getting a lot of nothing now.
---
Theft will be an issue. People can break in, even if you have level 3 locks on your doors.  There's a bug that allows people to simply go through the walls. 
---
Thanks man!! Also im about to venture downward on the map to snag those excavator plans! I just wish the community on my server was nicer and wanted to team up......
---
Not sure what you are talking about
---
still got the bos combat armour chest plan?
---
Yeah. He did specifically mention that a single SB fight necessitated a repair (of something). I don’t know about his mods. I’ll have to ask. 
---
Got unreleased items 😄
---
Firstly, sorry for your downvotes, i don't see why my comment has upvotes when yours has downvotes, you have a fair point imo.
---
It see what you mean, and yeah I understand that bethesda obviously cant fix every bug and release perfect games. No company can. But, that doesn't mean they can't try, right? 
---
Skyrim was a great game. Alot of effort certainly did go into it. However, I still believe that at that point their game development process had started to stagnate - they were using the same engine they had pretty much always been using and they still had same old bugs from previous games present. But, it was enoguh of a success to convince bethesda they're doing things right, so they've continued to stick with the same process again and again, with worse and worse results. 
---
Gamers always demand more, just like consumers do. Something that is good now is not likely to be as popular 10 years from now. Bethesda should know this, yet they decided that their process was good enough to keep people coming back.
---
So, my problem isn't specifically with Bethesda having loads of bugs in Skyrim, fo3 fo4 etc. My problem is that for a long time they haven't really tried to bring something new to the table. Afaik, they have no history of improving upon the mistakes of past releases, instead opting to try and carry on the successes. It's gotten to the point where we end up with fallout 76 - it's a perfect example of their development process, its basically their core gameplay cycle with everything that they haven't always done too well on in the past pretty much left to rot. This is what I mean when I say they settled!
---
Ok I am wrong then, sorry
---
You can’t wear Excavator till 25, so don’t be in too much of a rush. But do hang out in Welsh farming Mole Miner Scrap, cause you’ll need that black titanium 
---
&gt; the reality is that it is still a great game!! 
---
what fucking reality are you living in, it's mediocre *at best*...  don't get me wrong, the map is beautiful and the sound design is brilliant as ever, but the amount of reused content and lack of content in general, server stability issues, and bugs galore do not a great game make...
---
the patches have been mostly good, and honestly either have the game in BETA for three months or launch it in the state it's in now, and even that is pushing it, it still needs help, especially with balance, and had they done either they wouldn't have gotten nearly as much flak...
---
Were any of you meleeing? Between chameleon armor (crouch invisibility), stealth boys, perk cards and the reactive chameleon armor (the kind that makes you invisible if you get melee’d) in a fight you could almost stay invisibly permanently. 
---
I run a stealth sniper/melee build almost entirely and spend almost all my time crouched and almost permanently invisible myself. So throw some stealth boys in there and i can make it very hard to see or find me.
---
Yeah. My friend is melee, so he was getting hit. Non-PA was plenty protective but the maintenance costs were unbearable. 
---
*Woah!* it's your **4th Cakeday** Ryanlee1996! ^(hug)
---
Duping is gone.
---
It just works!
---
Kinda like everyone is using a left handed bolt action rifle?  Although I think that was more so they’d have a visual than anything else.
---
Thank you very much, well, patience is something I don't have enough of hence it is one of the things in me I am trying to improve. This damned camp system appears to be an excellent training.
---
My friend and I were picking fluxes just near the bunker and he ran into that yesterday on Xbox. He had to change worlds because it was so obnoxious
---
Not after our team member died once.  He spawned away but he stayed invisible for a long while while us gun people kept fighting. 
---
Idk, the perk says that and running dosent take you out of stealth, but idk how that stuff works.
---
I had one glorious session during a weekday where I was just wandering around, taking workshops and exploring. Took five, five workshops. Played for hours. Eventually the game froze, but it was great while it lasted.
---
I'll never forget that session.
---
I know what you mean.  It's fascinating to watch how some players have no manners.  No regard for personal space, patience, or taking "no" for answer.
---
It means that the AI doesn't detect you easier when you move full speed 
---
Billing this games as a service was nonsense. I was expecting at minimum a rough roadmap and regular content updates. Four months in they are still tight lipped on most regards to the current state of the game and future content. When Fallout 4 came out, it was about this time after that release that we got half of the DLC schedule announced. 
---
What we’ve gotten with 76 so far; are the same bugs “fixed” and reverted back to broken half a dozen times, handfuls of micro transaction cosmetics, and an announcement for a new mode where PvP is always enabled. But where are the new enemies, weapons, armor and quests?
---
I just want this game to have legs to stand on. The core gameplay is fun, it just needs to be ironed out, and at least have enough content to justify it continuing to go on. 
---
I've had this bug happen to me for my Automatic Tesla, its funny making lighting rain come down with 500/999
---
It was a joke about how there aren't any living human NPCs in the game
---
You propably unlocked the bos mod for the combat helmet. Same happened to me.
---
As far as I understand it, you can't learn bos from scrapping. Tried about 200 the last couple of days. :(
---
I'm stealth sniper build too,  I haven't seen the perk people has mentioned about increasing the length of a stealth boy.  Gonna look that one up
---
ESO made me cautious. In fact, ESO made me never play Elder Scrolls again. Until they make a single player version.. that won't change.
---
Very cool .. Kinda reminds me of the Normandy from Mass Effect
---
explains the abundance of food for something you never see the source of... least not by name.
---
It's called secret agent 
---
I know there was a bug with the armor that would keep you in stealth.  I got it a couple of times and couldn't see my own character even in third person.  It also kept my glow sights from working.  I would have to log out and back in to see myself.
---
With Class Freak, it reduces negatives to 0.
---
And this is a problem why? It’s the natural progression. Always has been

You are missing out xD

It’s the first effect on mine.

I'm 99% sure that's not intended and will be fixed or something lol
---
Teams: 20% of one person’s time
---
Roadmap: reduce server fleet costs by 40% each week, add atom shop items
---
People in this game are getting worse all the time.
---
 [u/willymchilybily](https://www.reddit.com/user/willymchilybily) If your still playing got any updates to add to this?
---
 *grabs* *~~his coat~~* *your lämp...*
---
To be fair, this is what Class Freak is all about though.
---
At max it is 75% reduction to the negatives they have to keep some drawbacks or everyone would just get all the mutations 
---
You put more effort in that post than Beth in Fallout76.
---
Looks like I something to pick next level up.
---
Lol. It's just Bethesda's way of forcing pvp.
---
No one does, Bethesda wont reveal the numbers. Probably because its well below expectations.
---
84 before perks is a lot for a semi auto weapon with 20+ rounds in the mag. I used mine with 56 damage and no perks to kill high level enemies just fine. With perks I could kill SBs. With perks and your rifle I could do a good job DPSing the queen assuming no no-help randoms are around.
---
The damage is so low now because you’re comparing it to the absolutely ridiculous high it was at before the change. It was a complete joke it was even allowed in and a massive oversight that displays the simplistic thinking that went into expanding the legendary system to the multi-star system.
---
Honestly this might not be a real option in the case of server crashes.  The architecture is probably to spin up servers on demand from a cloud based solution.  Those servers are probably in containerized virtual machines of some kind.  If the server crashes and kicks people off, then that server is more likely than not gone completely.  There is no server to reconnect to.  A new server container is spun up to accommodate player reconnects.
---
I dont know if it's worth it I never use stealth boys. I only use them to escape any pvp I dont feel like being in lol and 30 seconds is enough 
---
&gt;To be fair, consoles do have keyboards. Few games support keyboard input.
---
^ this though, yeah both console's have on-screen keyboards it's just rare you ever see them put to use. I think out of my 50-60 Game library on my PS4 the only one I can say for sure uses it is Warframe. 
---
Inside Hopewell Cave
---
Basic QoL is stable, at least for now. Introduce more variables will only increase the chance of exploit, and crash.
---
I would rather not have content removed, only added. This would be cool, the few robot-limb weapons from Automatron were conceptually great. More of them wouldn’t hurt... but only if they actually work worth a damn and aren’t buggy or broken. Firing all your MFC out of a single charge on an Assaultron head is pretty lame, and the Mr. Handy buzzsaw had a range shorter than your fists. 
---
There is such a thing as friendly fire and we’ve all done it.  Sometimes that leads to an early demise, but most of the time it’s a “my bad” moment.  There are griefers out there but if they choose to fuck with me they will be sorry.  I’m all about helping a brother or sister out and the best is when you team up and go on a run blasting fools. 
---
Also waiting for an update on this. Seems like something is missing. Also shoutout to the absolute fucking toilets going "look under the mat" and "the uplink is in the room hurr durr".
---
He's using chinese communist knockoff fusion cores
---
I hate this too. They need to do away with the whole 'object needs support' and 'intersects with another object'. It would be great to set stairs down first instead of a foundation. Or just put walls down.
---
I don't think they even know what people want.  They are just throwing stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks.
---
As the other guy mentioned, you can't wear excavator until 25, but you can find level 15 raider PA if you farm raider PA spawn locations. Google and watch videos to find the spots. I personally preferred cliffwatch, crosshair, 
---
For any one who wants the gun(not the plans) [This site](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/rare-weapons-alien-blaster-black-powder-guns) has instructions. I used them to get the blaster and the ammo mod a few days ago.
---
I started playing Fallout 4 after having three dwellers pass lvl 100 each in 76. 
---
Why are you interested in the glitch if you don't play? A reasonable question, in response to your dumb one.
---
I agree with this post and yours! 
---
You’re making shit up
---
It really is inexplicable. I made a Sally port outside my real front door. That was the only solution I could think of. 
---

Use at your own risk. There's been people who claim to have been using non cheat engine mods and gotten banned, who knows if they were duping or intentionally glitching besides the mods though. 
---
I have PA so no falling damage haha
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one. I had one go through the wall. Managed to capture a video of it and then debated on leaving the place immediately 
---
maybe they were a … g-g-g-g-ghost!
---
Long live Firefly!
---
I've had that happen too, he would had to have found away to control the bug.
---
This, lol I can't imagine not doing this.
---
Oh c'mon. We all know the four basic elements of life are Fire, Ice, Candy and Slime.
---
Best: Speed Demon, Healing Factor.
---
Situationally amazing: Talons/Twisted Muscles(for unarmed/melee), Herd Mentality(if always in a group) 
---
Worst: Unstable Isotope, Empathy
---
The rest aren’t bad but I prefer to review things I’ve used myself. I suspect I would add Marsupial to the best category if I’d ever gotten it.
---
The random encounters is easily one of their better features in the Fallout Universe!
---
Yes, PS4 
---
They'd be wood unfortunately... :/
---
Your obviously lying. A level 11 cant even use a Super Sledge, the lowest level for it is 30
---
I was hiding under a bridge because I was being harassed by a giant blinding bat when they came casually strolling by. 
---
I hear ya :). 
---
I was running out of stuff to focus on so I'm working on the cryprid loot list (I'm sure one already exists somewhere but I don't wanna see it).
---
wow, do you know why it exploded?
---
As a supplement to this, u/Bunny1328 created a spreadsheet with all vendors and what plans and mods they offer.  Here's the post where I saw it first - a comment on a thread and not a dedicated post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aoiait/has\_anyone\_compiled\_vendor\_plan\_inventory\_lists/eg1njdb](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aoiait/has_anyone_compiled_vendor_plan_inventory_lists/eg1njdb)
---
Maybe he was level 111?
---
If you ban all the players that still play then no one is left to play, shut down servers and shift developers to other projects that WILL make money.   This project has to be a sinking ship at this point,  so short of leaving it alive to train future coders on how to program - they really don’t care.
---
People say it was the mothman but i personally think it got hot in there and they exploded 
---
I don’t have internet access but I love Reddit. 
---
Yeah it is 
---
Can be bought at Watoga or Harper's Ferry 
---
If you mean the Heavy sledgehammer, there are like 4. Rocket, Piercing, bleeding and Heating (from memory)
---
Wait at least 6 months until the crash/bugs/server stability issues are (hopefully) fixed, and the price has dropped even more.
---
I found mine in a safe twice by the tnt bunker 3
---
Anyone else on xb1 where upon you get dc you lose your live connection and party as well?  I have to off n on to get party back as it says im still in it.
---
Well tough luck because expansions (if the game makes it that far) will be paid for AND there will be an atom shop.  It’s ok though because the atom shop is purely 100% cosmetic and has no impact on gameplay, right Unstoppables? 
---
You are a troll,  sir. 
---
I'm not sure any of these things are possible but here are some things I'd absolutely love to see in game!
---
I'm really in to decorating my camp and if a build budget would allow us to go more in depth, it would be amazing to see some items which are fixable? A way to have a less destroyed looking interior? Walls with wallpaper that's not hanging off etc. I really liked the wooden floors in the atom store and want to be able to build a more home like camp.
---
Glass walls! It seems I collect tonnes of glass and bulk and sell, would be good if we could build our own greenhouses and have plots/pots for crops too.
---
Pets. I'm so uncontrollably in love with the cats I come across in game. I spend ages following them.. alas, wasteland whisperer doesn't work on these cuties!
---
Trophies... 3 star legendary deathclaw head for my wall? Yes, please!
---
Bobblehead stands, magazine racks where we can actually store magazines. Miscellaneous clutter items for added homely touches. Curtains. 
---
Group events, we all have to kill a massive amount of something in however many hours or days and people are rewarded based on contribution.
---
Just more events at this point would be nice.
---
Really running out of things to do... :(
---
Four times the map size, 16 times the detail but not even half the content.
---
Really? I still get replenshished resources. I don't know why they would tie resource spawn in a place to a single player. Idk if it's different for loot vs enemies where for instance whitespring ghouls respawn if you leave and rejoin a server or server hop.
---
perfection.
---
There hasn't been any content updates to the game, but I enjoy it more now than when I first started. I spend my time farming legendaries to trade online, this is one of the only game economies I actually enjoy
---
thx
---
Other than bethesda making the game more of a grind its more the same
---
I don’t think Bethesda is going to secretly work for two years to release an entire new games worth of additions to fix the game. 
---
It’s disappointing how opaque and non communicative Bethesda is being with the community on what the plan to do with this game. If it’s a game as a service, with “regularly released content”; what is the plan? Release schedules? Announcements of any kind? 
---
That is interesting &amp; very concerning, thank you
---
Have you disabled pacifist mode before engaging?
---
Why the hell would I bother lying? Watch your accusations. It looked sledgy however it the ordeal was quite fast could have been something similar, two handed melee weapon. 
---
I regularly get good stuff from them still around lvl 50. But I did find it strange that the other day the drop I called (simply cause I passed a radio station) was locked. Everyone should enjoy the drops that get called by anyone
---
Yea that is what i do to 
---
Things like this makes me want to buy this game .
---
Lol no deffo 11 is still on my session (just blocked him) what is the point in playing this game if it is full of cheaters?!! 
---
This one I found has some stuff yours does not [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up\_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/edit#gid=641493749](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/edit#gid=641493749)

---
maybe you can combine/ collaborate
---
Yup. No achievements for beta. Have to start a new char
---
Some people lie so they can get popular posts, then they can get tons of upvotes and gain tons of Karma
---
All enemy attacks are coded into the game as “weapons” with corresponding IDs. You shouldn’t be able to equip or obtain them normally. It’s definitely a bug. 
---
Poor you.
---
Yeah since I have the plans I made like 30 and scraped them for mods then handed it out to friends since it took fusion cells adtere.modding it
---
well it wouldn't even be power armor any more, if they do it how i think it should be done, so it'd be impossible to steal
---
I don't want to give up destiny but I'd like something different to play at the same time. I was looking at Fallout 76 or the new one coming out Far Cry New Dawn
---
I wish they would at least make them more accurate 
---
Read the first paragraph and stopped. There’s no way in hell Bethesda is going to put that effort and resource into saving this game. They’re going to lose their shirt on this game regardless of what they do. They’ll more than likely write it off as a loss and move on. 
---
Just hit 51 and no level 50 achievement.  Holy cow.
---
I don’t get why they made base building so much more restrictive than Fallout 4. Stairs shouldn’t have to be snapped to the floor, and should be allowed to clip through the ground is necessary to allow for a ramp to a raised doorway. 
---
I’m sure there was a performance/anti-exploit reasoning behind it, but it seems unreasonable and illogical despite the intention. 
---
lots of junk that sits out in the open are now tied to the player. You might see some items at login that then disappear after you finish loading, I used to see this all the time at the watoga merchant.  Can't say for sure what all is affected, but I thought it was most things with recent patches.
---
Agreed.
---
They could have used dialogue in quotes like every other game ever and not had inconsistent verb usage and awkward writing throughout the entire game. 
---
Final fantasy level fix.
---
My desired playstyle would be to stay connected to a server, and receive level appropriate loot for the difficulty of monsters slain. I'd like to be able to play for a while without having to stop to press food and water buttons every 20 minutes so I don't suffer a gameplay penalty, and I'd like to be able to go into the world to interact with it and not just desperately try to maintain my armor and weapons by constantly scavenging.
---
I can build a cryolator and a nuclear fusion generator from the trash of the wasteland, but my character can't figure out how to power up a fridge. What's up with that.
---
I really appreciate the time you took to write that it is actually really helpful. And the stuff you identified about being a solo player is how I feel about it. I just play when I want to often at strange times &amp; I don't want the pressure of a team. I get that in real life :)
---
I'm not that sad, lol!! 
---
Just hit level 51 and no achievement.  This blows.
---
Personally I'm more than happy setting my own obscure goals. My current one is collecting and designing the ultimate gear for stalking players and messing with them from the shadows.
---
No just checked pacifist mode off
---
Bethesda never had any post-launch support in their games. They probably thought it would just go like every other games they've released, just throw a few DLCs at it once in a while but otherwise be completely hands-off. But while it worked for their single player games (where bugs can be fixed with mods, balance issues aren't a problem, you don't have to deal with connectivity issue etc...), it doesn't work with a multiplayer game. I doubt they ever had a real plan for post-launch support in the first place, other than adding stuff to the atomic shop and releasing a few DLCs).
---
There can be random spawns that didn't got called by anyone, but those aren't usualy locked and can be looted without any concequences.
---
It’s like every other gaslighting shitstorm people kick up now a days. Unfounded rage and fear mongering fueled by willful ignorance and intentional lies. People spread those rumors just to continue hurting the game, and they haven’t talked about it since because everyone knows it was all smoke in the first place. 
---
DO NOT DO IT. D2 in it's current state is **substantially** superior, I have played both for 100s of hours.  FO76 has no end game and the loot system is trash. D2 has somewhat decent loot and quite a bit more to do at max level. It runs better. It has less bugs. It looks better. It has far far far more active players. 
---
Wait for them to fix FO76, if they haven't already abandoned it.
---
What platform are you on? If your on xbox or ps4 its probably not a hacker because you cant even use hacks for fo76 on the consoles 
---
always
---
Not to mention, it's often not even worth your time above level 20 or so.
---
I've got 200+ supply requisitions that are just rotting
---
A story as old as online gaming itself, if you're better than them, they're noobs and if they're better than you they're cheaters lol.
---
The 3 Ws: Whitesprings, West-Tek, and Watoga
---
I dont play much since the tse nerf and whitespring nerf but whitesprings is still ok
---
It's not caused by crops
---
Did you really call Microsoft BEFORE restarting the game?
---
You can. That’s probably what happened. 
---
The solution is turning down the aggro range to camps for ranged enemies
---
So I guess the, added instanced timers to weights and dumbells at the gyms too 
---
Nope, you're not alone. This game is loads of fun and has an interesting story too.
---
https://youtu.be/3hFDpksCCho
---
You can. That’s probably what happened.
---
Yeah. I think a modest increase in the availability of deep pocked mods (akin to calibrated shocks) might be part of the solution, though my friend had more trouble with upkeep than storage. I’m the hoarder (in my PA). 
---
That is really cool.  I am going to have to carry my tinfoil hat around with me now.
---
Never realized the ws before. Very true well done
---
Glad to hear people are still making it work. 
---
I’m sorry that it matters to you so much that I like this game
---
What build do you use?
---
All discord lfg dropped to maybe 1 post every few hours. 
---
I WANT to love Fallout 76 so badly. It’s much like a dysfunctional relationship at this point. Keep coming back hopeful and longing for change so I can once again be excited and feel that spark.... only for it to turn into a short time of enjoyment and all the issues that were so apparent are now staring at you yet again and causing even more frustration then before.... 
---
That being said, I hold a lot of faith in Bethesda... possibly too much. I still play every day for at least a little while to show my support. I think the more people stop playing or uninstall it will push back any potential improvements that may be coming because it will become “meh, what the hell is even the point?” 
---
I love Bethesda and I love Fallout, but it becomes an issue when you have to ask yourself “how many more times am I going to allow myself to be frustrated like this?” Every time you log on. 
---
ESO style fix I say, where they finish bug fixes and then aggressively add actual content. Bethesda won't give up an online game, all of those posts about abandoning it are silly. Online games are too equivalent to money machines for them to give FO76 up
---
Im from wv as well my guy😂😂
---
Im on PS4. Totally confused me. Wondered if it was a server glitch or system slowing down or something but I had a couple of short slowdowns at start of battle then most of battle ran smoothly. I kept hitting him with barrells on 150 odd damage shotgun 10 or 15 times and nothing, plus grenades. I used phycho and med-x. his health bar stayed full and I got finished off with one hit. Also it looked like my health was going down even when he wasn't hitting me. Just wondered of there was a known issue 
---
Sorry but it’s not my build. I’ve been PA for carry weight for a long time. It’s my melee non-PA friend who quit the armor game. I’ll have to ask him a bit more. I was just struck at how often he repaired and how much ballistic fiber he was going through. 
---
I read this post with the music from beauty and the beast and I want disappointed. 
---
Yea, it was probably a server glitch. This has happened to me many times before on PC, were you shoot him and nothing happens. And he probably wasn't using a Super Sledge, it was probably the Sledgehammer with the "Rocket" mod.
---
It’s definitely a small item in the list of crap but it’s amazing that it still exists. But you’re right they might be just like that’s an easy fix compared to others and are just pushing it off. Who knows with these guys.
---
I really enjoy this game too, but that's what makes all the problems so infuriating. A fly on shit doesn't bother me any. A fly on my food does.
---
It is much better from what I can tell, and definitely since launch.
---
That being said, if this is the kind of game you have fun playing, then I do recommend it.
---
You are going to have to try harder at spinning your implausible tales.  
---
In my opinion the game is fun untill endgame, then its just a grind unless youre playing melee
---
Couldve been a number of purposeful or accidental glitches i suppose. Also im sure its been said already in the replies but if you have chameleon armor on you stay invisible even when firing and as long as you move in short bursts you wont appear either until you stand or keep crouch walking for too long. 
---
Just a heads up for future fights to keep an eye out for. Ive caught quite a few people by surprise with it. Ill shoot, move a foot to the left or right and as long as you have bushes and foliage behind you its very hard for them to gauge where your head is. Pair that with the sentinel armor and you can basically become a predator lol.
---
Thank you for your contribution to the community.
---
Great Job, I will happily use this, and give you my upvote sir.
---
The white knight perk still helps with armor degradation pretty well as well as repair cost. If he is wanting to stay out of power armor and is on PS4 I can hook him up with some Ballistic fiber 
---
Do you know about the inside the vault? They communicate with us every week with a schedule and updates on what they are doing 
---
It is better but most ppl ran out of things to do
---
Legendary 3 star weapons? No place since the latest patch.
---
He means that its meant to act like a secret room that you enter from within your camp. Like a bathroom. You dont normally enter a bathroom from the outside of your house. Veil of mysteries room? 
---
Dont need to downvote him :/
---
The fact that no one has heard a word from Pete Hines or  Todd Howard is a pretty telling piece of evidence, IMO.
---
And so begins the hundred-years war. 
---
Yes, yes I did
---
Thanks for that I actually decided against anthem already. The other thing I'm looking at is Far Cry New Dawn
---
It’s been what? A little over 3 months since the game launched and you’re bitching about dlc already? LOL
---
Server disconnects sucks, a fridge would be cool... 
---
But everything else is your play style not being fun or working, please refer to the above comment
---
I know it might sound like I'm being a sore loser!! I think might be server issue going on as last night I had some guy in my camp who didn't move, His health was practically zero and I tried to blow him up with mini nukes just about everything else and nothing happened. And he was there for like 2 hours.. surely should have been booted from server for inactivity in that time. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or the above 
---
99% chance of no. I haven't heard of that perk being used on shotguns. 
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
Ill boot up shortly on pc and have a look what settings u can change gimme half hour 
---
Think of all the awesome atom shop items you'll miss!
---
It’s almost as if everyone went into an uproar and said hold the content until the game is playable enough to enjoy it. They’re patching the biggest complaints (albeit slowly) to make the base game *playable* and fun. You just can’t please some people. 
---
Key to not maxing out is the Marie Kondo thing. It's impossible for that suit of level 45 power armor to bring you joy - scrap it. Can't use a rare weapon yet? Scrap it. You'll get more. Clothes horse? No one cares if you wear the same outfit every day. Sell or scrap anything you're not wearing. Built your camp to your satisfaction? Bundle and sell all that steel. And FFS stop picking up burned books.
---
Thats how i used mine,  Used a second sliding door with the floor pad for an exit.  saferoom complete
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
I love the scenery, the isolation, I even really like how quests are generated via notes/tapes etc so the lack of NPC's doesn't bother me. I'm a lone wanderer and don't get involved in any of the PVP/multi-player stuff so can't particularly comment on it.
---
But I just wish there was more to do/there was a sense of purpose at the end of the game. I've started a new build after getting bored on my level 65 - on previous FO games I haven't felt bored until level 100+. I'm not sure how others have managed to get into the high 100's/200's on FO76?
---
There is also a raider vendor in the building beside top of the world.
---
Poor any idiot still playing this game. And poor developers being made the scapegoat for a shitty management.
---
Yeah it's quite a bit harder than FO76. That system is much better. Several MMOs use it. 
---
I just put the garden in the basement of my 3 level stone foundation barn.  Only mole rats get to it now.  
---
Nice work! 
---
I wont expect for you to accept it, but it will. Melee has 3 major disadvantages-- inability to hit things in the air at all without switching off of melee, inability to be used at range causing you to have to close the distance to be any use, and being in melee range means greater damage taken. The weapons with the most disadvantage will come with the highest dps, as it should and as is often the case in most fps games.
---
&gt; Server hopping shouldn't even be a thing, but since it is we have to accept the fact that things on the next random server after hopping may not be how we'd want them to be in a perfect world. I mean c'mon, they are taking away your chance at a chance?
---
But that's just it. Even if you don't server hop, and instead only play one instance, the fact that the camp is there could ruin the chance for that single play-through. So you fast travel to Charleston Train station only to find out a camp is there breaking your chance to try and get him to spawn. You've wasted caps, plus load times just to find out you don't even get your 1 in 10 chance to get him to spawn.  
---
BTW: regarding legendary loot, make them agro and health Regen BEFORE killing them and you will almost be guaranteed legendary drop... Stop doing the same same thing that you already know does not work.
---
Problem solved.
---
It's nothing like Destiny. It's power usage based, weapons are just for white auto attack dmg. Destiny 2 is a shooter which is shooting based. Like, the opposite. I'll get back to you when Anthem scores substantially higher than FO76 at nearly every site.
---
Are they even going to do THAT? they seem to have abandoned us altogether 
---
I loved this mutation... Then I loaded the game once and it was gone. 🤮🤮😢😢😢
---
Demolitions expert is not worth the point cost, get stabilized instead.
---
It took you long enough
---
Had it happen once, but it was after I more or less sprinted into the building so I assumed he followed me in.
---
Hopefully someone makes a mod that will let you know whether you have a chance of getting a plan by scrapping a weapon. 
---
Giant deathclaws, souped up supermutants and behemoths, insane hordes of ghouls, huge wendigo's, zeta aliens
---
I had the exact opposite experience yesterday. I dropped a nuke on The Whitespring. Ran through the whole loop (club house, up the row of housing, over to the hotel, up to the second row of housing, over to the super mutants, down the fairway, and back to the club house) 3 times in a row. Went back to camp and made stable flux. The nuke zone finished and I went back and did it again to mop up the last of the glowing ghouls. Got 3 levels and 20-25 legendary items. Looking forward to trying out my new Instigating Broadsider.
---
Yeah! I wonder if the flatwoods monster is a marooned Zetan from before the war.
---
Could be his legs are deformed and he's in that contraption because he was vivisected in a US government lab... And now he's out for revenge while he waits for the mothership to come.
---
I kinda feel lucky that some of my stuff only duplicated when I moved. I was super annoyed but then hearing about the corn, man fuck that corn. So glad it's not corn.

Have you encountered the Ms. Nanny that tells you a bedtime story?

Hey, want to apologize, I was cranky and said some dumb stuff here. I like this game, , maybe not as much as 4 or 3, but I enjoy it. I just get tired of coming here and having people just bash the game and Bathesda. They’ve never done a game like this, they’re not going to hit a home run on the first at bat, and I’m going to be patient. I remember every WoW release, then the inevitable hatred, then the eventual fix releases. And oh god the Pandas. But I’m enjoying this ga,e, and I just want to enjoy.
---
TL; DR I was a jerk and apologize for it.
---
Log out at a train station or 76, not that hard to do.
---
I would much appreciate a working game, that doesn't crash, and disconnect, and isn't filled with bugs, when you pay $60 for it. Or for some poor idiots who paid like $200 to be basically paying alpha testers. Yeah. We'd really fucking appreciate it.
---
Never played any fallout before this one.  Either you’re doing something that actually works or you’re full of it.
---
yeah they "fixed" the good and left the "unwanted/unneeded"

Holy Christ Cazador mob spawns from a boss... that’s a terrifying idea, could you imagine.

That's harsh. But true
---
I've expected some presidential elections to happen.
---
It’s almost as if the story... is about how there isn’t any NPCs. I know hating 76 is cool and everything but hear me out. That’s literally the story. It’s about being on your own it’s about finding out what happened to the people of West Virginia. 
---
I use iron fist and a bloodied death claw gauntlet  with twisted muscle and adrenal reaction for 500-2k per hit. Strength buffs will drive it even higher.  Add unyielding armor for epic damage.
---
The interior of the blast zone increased levels on everything except animals.
---
I've got around 200 hours playing, and I had never encountered the Flatwoods Monster until yesterday. I got it doing the quest from the Hunting cabin... and then encountered it it whitesprings an hour later. Was crazy to never see the thing, and then get two encounters so close together. 
---
I would like to see the mire come alive with large hostile plants and bloodvine creatures spawning all over when you nuke it.  
---
What’s your psn?
---
Nope. Popped when I scrapped a combat leg. Unless that’s the glitch it comes with the helmet
---
It’s just glitched. Plain and simple
---
It represents Bethesda and the rats are the shills and fanbois.
---
I bought fo76 when it came out and since then put about 2.5 hours into it. I really REALLY wanted it to be fun. But the frame rate stuttering and lack of interaction caused me to put it down for a long time. Is it worth getting back into now?
---
Happened to me as well yesterday.

Always taking workshops  always getting disconnected

Nearly all Raider Power Armor plans can be found at the Raider Vendor at top of the world. 
---
Nearly all T-40, T-51b T-60 plans can be found in the Watoga shopping center. 
---
All Excavator plans can be found in Chad's offerings in Camden Park.

By the way jet doesn’t exist yet and probably won’t be the jet you get in previous fallouts that slow time. 
---
I seem to be getting spammed with Team invites lately, and more often than not, the player cannot be found on the map (using stealth), and this generally seem indicative of someone simply trying to find your camp, so they can destroy it and set you up for their other Pussy buddies that enjoy the challenge of 4 against 1 battle with a high level player.
---
Suffice it to say, the fucked up game mechanics combined with the over abundance of scrotum licking ass monkeys in this game has changed the way I play.
---
* I do not accept random invites, period.
---
* I no longer trade with anyone who doesn't have a mic.
---
* My main character will no longer trade with anyone who is not on my friends list.
---
But why can't it be safe to log our near your own camp? 
---
They think that by downvoting posts like yours they are actually achieving something. Pretty pathetic.
---
No... commando is only for rifles. 
---
The weight of high radiation fluids is reduced by Travelling Pharmacy and glowing mass weight is reduced by Thru-Hiker.
---
That sounds awesome! I bet those Mirelurk king photos are cool. I don't think the flatwoods monster I met yesterday was bugged though. It got aggro and shot me when I jumped on it, so it had all the normal capabilities. It seemed like a set piece or random encounter. 
---
Next time you make it to Berkeley Springs, listen for an odd mechanical hum near the castle, and hop up on the southeast parapet. I think you might need marsupial.
---
That sounds like the "raider" theme of the week. Seen a few posts from "raiders" stating they ask for you to give them stuff and when you deny they attack you and or level your base, the way PvP is there really is not recourse for their actions. A few measly caps bounty or if you engage and they kill you you lose a chunk of caps and they get a tiny bounty.
---
Have you played Fallout 4, especially survival mode?  This game is a lot like that if you play solo, although the different buildings are spread out more in West Virginia.  
---
roaming power armor deathclaw mobs
---
Stealth Boy MkIII + the appropriate perk makes you keep invisibility for a while. I usually have between 5 &amp; 10 of them just for PvP and it makes wonders.  
---
They only ever have power armour plans, I guess I must just be unlucky.
---
Because, according to people like that, it's your fault for logging out at your CAMP.
---
Its been out for ages lol
---
Awesome thanks guys, also the ore...... i have alot of different types ..... gold , black titanium.....
---
.... but i dont know what to do with them ....... do i scrap, or smelt them in a certain spot???
---
Only on this sub. In game I have only met nice people.

---
Two shot, because Vampiric heals you only when you hit an enemy which happens infrequently with the long reload time of the Dragon. I use a Vampiric Handmade and Vampiric Gatling because of their fire rate, large magazine and thus constant healing. I can regen the SBQ's melee attacks with the Gatling quite easily.
---
I've played fallout since day one (back in the 90s) and really enjoy the games. We started 76 in beta. I still play it daily. I have ALWAYS been a solo player. A few of my boys started playing as well as my husband so we do all play together sometimes. Before they started playing I met a guy who was really awesome and became a great friend. Through him I met several other people. I've become real life friends with one of them. 
---
Don't hold yourself to just solo if you play 76. While it's fun alone, it opens up a whole new world of fun for you in this game.
---
As for being on the fence buying it, right now it is cheaper than it has been without being on sale. The bugs get a bit frustrating, but personally I over look them. I enjoy the game and enjoy the social aspect of playing with the amazing group of people I have met. 
---
Oh ok got you. He possibly used the buff you get from the mystery story line. It's like a stealth boy except stronger if I'm not mistaken 
---
Move your camp to a different location then move it back again
---
I got banned for that, I posted a players name just complaining and making a warning to watch out, he preys on low level players. They said it was witch hunting. But the witch hunting rule says don't ask users to go after another player. I didn't so that so I argued with a mod about it and they never replied.
---
This
---
I can't select it when it's underwater though. 
---
Still with bugs and exploits and no endgame content. It’s not worth your time at all
---
Where do you find the BoS mod plans???
---
I said move your camp, not move the object/building
---
&gt; That’s literally the story. It’s about being on your own it’s about finding out what happened to the people of West Virginia.
---
So write a book, not a game.
---
Haha, wow! You sound like a real jackass! 
---
Good point, this place has gotten ...salty recently.
---
Too long, didn’t read. 
---
Being forced to have other people around is the worst idea Bethesda had for this game.
---
No that's what I meant from the start, I can't pay to move my entire camp either or the message appears. I can't move the actual camp object either. 
---
Yeah they really didn't think this game all the way through, did they?
---
Literally nothing to do but grind for legendaries with a terrible drop rate
---
I run into people like that a lot who wait to ambush. More so than griefers or forceful pvpers. 
---
Haha, wow! I don't care!
---
ESO was only a success because if Zenimax, not Bethesda. People tend to forget this. FO76 is just Bethesda.
---
I have seen a few bases that do something similar to where there is more of a perimeter. And then they build like a pseudo basement and put all the crops down there. Realistically it's not a bad idea since it prevents people from snagging your crops if they are just making their way through. 
---
I wish the bulldozing feature allowed us to make minor landscaping changes to do things such as leveling terrain. 
---
Its funny when it doesn't go there way 
---
Keep flying my friend through this sea of dark with a trail of fire on your 6, light the way for others so they may follow us through this long night
---
The items can be upgraded! So feel free to do it at whatever level you'd like. :")
---
Ok buddy, take your tryhard tears outta here and join another server, I promise your little robot will spawn there.
---
Yeah, I might not take it off ever again now.
---
Ok but no one wanted that at all. You're talking about a player base that loves dialogue and talking with the NPCs. Why TF would you have a barren wasteland with no dialogue for players who love dialogue?????
---
There shouldn’t be anything stopping you from placing your camp in a different location. Are you by a natural resource or popular area? If so try server hopping and see if the “camp cannot be placed” prompt pops up. 
---
Not a tryhard and I'll stay here thanks :)
---
I never finished that mission so idk what the buff is lol
---
The only logical reasoning I can think of is that because this game has world PvP then removing stairs to an upper level would (in the Devs mind) give an unfair advantage.... which really doesn’t make sense because an opponent could just equip the Wrecking Ball perk and blow away the upper floor pieces.
---
It's not worth bitching about, our mistake was wasting money on this boondoggle of a game, nothing will get fixed.
---
I did not and have not had gold for a few months, so it expiring is not the issue
---
But clearly you are, because that outfit spawns I’m leveled lists as well, that’s how I got it. You are just impatient and will blow up someone’s base because you cannot get a clock or a black coat, and he still spawns if your camp is there you know, so you are just ruining peoples games and getting caps taken from you for no reason.
---
That would be objectively worse for the game given how the Creation Engine works, unless all DLC was installed regardless of if you paid for it and to actually use it you had to pay.
---
Otherwise, people would be unable to play with eachother if they didn't have the same DLC, when finding a server it'd have to be only populated by people with the DLC you have, etc. 
---
I sometimes downvote stuff just to see people rage about it ;) "oh this think skin will get angry about us not being #woke"
---
If you get this game, don't limit yourself to solo. I have always been a solo player ONLY until I happened across one guy who became a huge asset and friend ingame.. Through him I was introduced to several other people in game. Now I couldn't imagine playing 76 without them. It opens up a whole new world that wouldn't exist solo. If you run across people, not all of them are there just to harm. 
---
I would say I'm in quite a popular part but I've server hopped more than 30 times now. This is rediculous.
---
Harper's Ferry, BHoS vendor in Watoga, and last night (for the first time) the vendor bot at Sutton Station had them. 
---
Thank you lorax for speaking on behalf of all of us. After having a dialogue with you, I can do without it for a while.
---
Then you can have yet another shitty broken weapon in this shitty broken game.
---
I have 5 large purifiers at my base, so thats 25 pure water per round, i use them way to fast. 
---
Yeah that'll help the failing game and dwindling player population. Very productive. When the real waves hit they hit like a Tsunami and nothing will stop them.
---
I still run PA in the Blast Zones, not for the protection but more for the carry weight.
---
Outside of Blast zones I only occasionally use PA for the Jet Pack ability.
---
I use all 2\*-3\* Heavy Combat Armor with BOS mod, Deep Pocketing, and several with Weight reducing perks.
---
My Character is a High Stealth/Sniper build, and I can sneak through Whitesprings, Kill every Ghoul with an Instigating Death Tambo, and never be discovered when I'm playing alone, Team play seems to seriously affect Stealth for some reason.
---
I frequently kill level 80 SBs without being discovered, even when they land and I get right in their face with a death tambo.
---
I don't have any pics, but looking at the files it uses the Casual Underarmor Linings
---
todd howard dumb, modders good, wheres the dlc at after 3 months,   KARMA ME UP
---
Yes, got it now ;)
---
What???? you ENTERED the "head"????? How??? Tell me, please! I did find a weird place with floating water, but couldn't get inside https://i.imgur.com/5FeHHrm.png The water could be some kind of clue... =]]]]
---
Stopped playing it once this shit happened. Sure, it's a valid experience of the wasteland but I play games for fun.
---
If I wanna go through annoying shit for fun I'll just plan to work on saturday... 
---
To the people DOING this shit, we pity you.  No one confident in life or a good soul would pull this shit.
---
Betting most are overweight basement dwellers who see this as there way of 'sticking it to the World.'
---
Gonna laugh my ass off when the servers die on a few years and these stupid fucks will have no choice but to return to their sad, pathetic lives of blaming their problems on everyone else.
---
The one thing FO76 has done smashingly in the last 2-3 months is manage to break a broken game even worse, and create a World where losers who cant do shit in life can pretend they are badasses.  Truth is, even in that action, deep down these assholes know no one loves them and their lives are really just useless IMO.
---
Bold of you to assume I care about what the vendor bot sells but go off I guess. I just have my teammates kill me if I'm ever wanted so I don't give a shit if I lose the caps, especially because I'm not losing a lot. And I'm not ruining anyone's game, seeing as they can just move their camp elsewhere or move it over like two inches and everything is repaired. I really don't give a shit, bud. If someone's camp is placed there or behind the golf club at Whitesprings with turrets, I'm leveling it. :)
---
Hey dude, I've just started a melee build and I'm level 10. I put the first 3 levels into Gladiator as I was going to one-hand. Is it too late to switch to fists only and Martial Artist?
---
I have an instigating black powder pistol but unfortunately it's only lvl 20 or 25 so after the initial shot it wont do nearly enough damage. But I definitely considered it 
---
The game came out in December. The silence part which is the worst takes months to figure out. No one knew how they'd react or what they would say. But now, it's halfway through February and they still haven't said shit
---
You're CAMP must be in a spot near an enemy spawn. I never have enemies at my CAMP when I log in.
---
Yeah, always a nice surprise when stuff starts turning pink and going mad. 
---
Next time I get a hostile flatwoods monster I'm going to let it follow me around, see how many pink creatures I can get. 
---
Thanks for this . Great job!
---
I've got those, are they super rare or something? Impact landing doesn't even do any damage in-game for me, they're useless
---
Missing out on what?
---
VikrimRay make me an offer
---
Not even close....played a bit, ask for refund and got it.
---
Garbage game from a garbage company, and I'm a huge Fallout fan.
---
No wonder it has one of the worst rating and biggest backlash ever. Honestly this community is hilarious, protecting such a bad game that should have spent another 6 month in development, at minimum. This is exactly why gaming companies out this shit on customers.
---
Was it just fiddling around with fence placement until it all worked?
---
This must have happened to me last night. I got that quest and went to open it and noticed a few minutes later that I was wanted. 
---
This game finds surprising new ways to fail.
---
I can't imagine that a Vampire Dragon would be that useful because it has such a slow firing rate and I think Vampire restores a fixed amount of HP, not some % of how much damage you do to them.  Vampire works best when it's things like knives or heavy weapons - stuff where you're hitting constantly.
---
I don't care about players taking it. Plant loot is player specific. But i was tired of mobs destroying them i know you can replace them for free if you just scrap them but you have to wait until it grows again.
---
Thank you!
---
Fou d this on r/popular.
---
Bummer figured out how to run wire up walls and through windows looks like modern set up
---
That spot worked. And now I found a spot to farm screws.
---
I know, I have a responsibility to upvote  "game bad", BGS is at risk if I don't single boost those brilliant and insightful comments.
---
Actually it came out mid-November (3 months exactly this Wednesday)
---
The 3 Ws are good, most of the time, but Uranium Fever is a 3 legendary guarantee, and you can get good rolls there, I got a level 35 TSE Handmade from UF.
---
Also there is usually a Legendary enemy at Pleasant Valley, from which I seem to get 3\* weapons from frequently, got a really Sweet 3\* Auto Grenade launcher there yesterday.
---
Legendary Super mutants &amp; Ghouls also spawn periodically in the Capital building.
---
Keypad.
---
Work around it make foundations next to each other then build key pad out  made a camp with wires following walls out windows pretty slick no doors only key pad if on Xbox can help...
---
Do you go through a lot of food and water? Without negating the negative effects of speed demon that would be exhausting.
---
What lvl are you, theres a damage scaling bug after you hit lvl 70 or so and it gets worse the higher lvl you get. Thats why enemies cut through you like butter.
---
Post has nothing to do with weapons.
---
Maybe if you didn’t have a shitty broken brain you would realize that the post is about learning the helmet plan. Not a weapon.
---
Noticed in Fort Defiance several times the last few days ghouls would be laying on the ground... not dead... not alive... couldn't target them.. couldn't shoot them... lol I just walked over them and went on about my business... 
---
Yeah sorry english is not my native language.
---
I think you missed the biggest issue that will kill the game:  the inability to monetize it long term.  Is there anyone that thinks the atom shop is raking them in a lot of money?  I see things I wouldn’t mind having, but save my atoms for things I really want.  It would take something truly amazing with a 24 hour Buy window for me to even consider spending real money, and considering how rare it is for me to see people wearing atom shop gear, I feel I am not alone.
---
post release support will fade to nothing if there is no additional money being brought in.  Whomever designed this atom shop system has to be looking for a job now!
---
the only reason that the 2 shot legendary explosive shotgun exist is to 1 shot kill other players. i'm level 96, full x01 power armor, and get 1 shot killed by a level 86 with a legendary two shot shotgun. takes the fun out of the game, give the other player at least a chance to fight back, this 1 shot kill isn't fun for either player
---
Nice! Glad I could help.
---
The frame rate is a lot better. I honestly just try to play it as another single player game though. It’s not that players are assholes or anything. I generally have good experiences with them, but I just prefer to play solo. 
---
Gutted.
---
I read in this sub once the interesting idea to carry a few BP pistols so you can go into a fight with them all loaded. Then you can get a few shots off before ducking behind cover to reload them all, which takes a while. They're free up at Prickett's Fort, maybe worth a try.
---
My bad, I thought it said the assaultron head weapon and unloaded both barrels of salt. I should've said it's a useless helmet that is actually worse than in previous games because those helmets actually did something to protect you.
---
Hmmm intresting. I've been once in Glassed Caverns during nuke, and I didn't read all I could, but I understand SBs were created partially by nuking the ground as form of mining. 
---
But did SB take little time to develope, or were they created right at war, or by the war? Is the FEV flowing downwards toward bog, related to some bats becoming SB.
---
It's nothing really. Food and water is everywhere.
---
Ah true that. I was a little off. Sorry. But point is. Three months is the minimum to establish they've been avoiding us. They have said nothing for three months :/
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Nope, was running three ranks of tenderizer in charisma.
---
So it's for a shitty, broken helmet that doesn't protect against damage like every other helmet in every other game.
---
One of my chars, doesn't use armor at all, in blast zones I wear hazmat. Tbh unkillable my ghoul is.
---
didnt know. thanks
---
Oh I agree completely. The last 2 patches have driven me away from the game, which is sad. because quite honestly, nov/dec were a fkn blast
---
I enjoy this game, but it also makes me think of how much better it would of been if that was a npc you could interact with. It reminds me of the random encounters out in the wasteland from 3 and NV and the disappointment is there 
---
Responder vendor bot can also randomly appear on road between Riverside Manor &amp; Charleston Fire Department. 
---
https://twitter.com/revkeithps4/status/1091211439816097792?s=21
---
I’ve also found him following the train tracks out out of the forest and to Grafton Station.
---
https://twitter.com/revkeithps4/status/1094006722148982784?s=21
---
Its completely north. North from abbies bunker. And fog crawler comes sometimes. And super mutant. So weird. 
---
Forbidden knowledge repeatable quest could drop them. And in the train car by watoga train station
---
So inside the vault updates are?
---
If you’re so pissed about the game why bother to go on this sub. We’re just having fun playing the game and learning things.
---
I think you only get mod plans that way.
---
&gt; melee even in the hands of the AI is too effective. 
---
What is the actual explanation for that?  I've seen that too, where I can tank bullets like no tomorrow, but the moment that same Lv. 68 Scorched Conquerer hits me with a spear, good-bye 25% health.  Does this particular enemy have something like Incisor or something?
---
And, exactly like you say, it *really* sucks because the game doesn't consistently take elevation into account when they melee you.  First thing I do when I see them wind up is try to Marsupial jump.  They clearly miss, from my perspective, but I get hit anyway in midair.
---
So you've been playing the same genre of game for...15 years. and you notice its easy to get worn out on it.  https://youtu.be/QhnsC2V4_0w
---
KILL THEM AND LET GOD SORT THEM OUT
---
IT’S CAAAAAAAAAAAAAMP
---
Not a problem at all. It's massively exaggerated but I get downvoted every time I say it. Still saying it though!
---
400+ hours and no griefing of any note.
---
Uranium fever isn't bad for rads. Just stay away from the extractors.
---
I love lamp
---
Likewise, I'm pretty much all Vanguard with one Chameleon piece and another I'll sometimes swap out for Auto-Stim if I'm going against the Scorchbeast Queen.  I have about 430 damage resistance and 370 energy at full health, and with my Vampire Combat Knife, I'm usually at full health a lot.
---
This seems to work pretty well, although there are some really odd exceptions.  High-leveled melee Scorched seem to slice right through my defenses. 
---
I heard it's good luck to tap newbies on the head with a super sledge. Please come back. I just want to tap you on the head a few times with my super sledge for good luck. 
---
I wanna keep my Golden Summerset Special thank you very much. They’ll have to pry it from my cold, dead, irradiated hands.
---
Exactly. Just search the bodies when the event is done, so you're not overencumbered during it, and then scrap all the gear and junk at the eorkbench.
---
Are you sure , TSE was nerfed their damage is a fraction of what it used to be to the point where any more nerfing would make the TSE legendary effect not viable at all.
---
Besides you say you get killed by a level 86 despite you being 96 , that’s not a particularly big gap.
---
You got everything wrong, vendor bot doesn't ever sell Traveling Leather Coat and "clean" prospectors hat is not rare at all.
---
I was with you until a recent hotfix introduced bugs with mutations and diseases, resulting in Sneaking being very unreliable. Basically cut me off at the knees since I’m playing with lots of mutations and sneaking...
---
Taking a break until they add more bug fixes, content or balance isn’t a problem for me. Just stability.
---
I did not know that plants were player specific. That's cool. But I agree this scrapping method is annoying since I like to have everything lined up very neatly in my base. 
---
And how did any of those bugs affect Skyrim's or Morrowind's *online* and *multiplayer* functions? Did this make their microtransactions more or less broken?
---
*Oh, wait...*
---
And let's assume what you say is 100% true. With the ES games you name, I can download and use mods/patches from Bethesda or third parties to make the game run however I want, either fixing it or breaking it further. There's no such option with Fallout 76. They can't rely on the community to fix whether or not bobby pins weigh a pound this week or not.
---
You're trying to apply a level of forgiveness to Bethesda that's unwarranted. F76 has technically been in development as long as F4 was (it's a component for the F4 game they spun off) yet it did boneheaded things like tying your speed to framerate and leaving in all the bugs from the single-player game while generating new ones.
---
You may think invisible bears and vanishing items are just par for the course, but the stakes are a bit higher for an online game.
---
I get down voted anytime I say the TSE nerf was needed but I have seen a drop in people destroying bases since they nurfed then. Now that they cant snipe a base to nothing with a shotgun from 100 yards away lol
---
It's because all the reasonable people have left already after these mediocre patches.
---
This! :( Always makes me sad when they assume the worst, even when I wave.
---
That's how we got the ghouls in the first place
---
Well thats some steaming pile of bullshit you are writing there, did you wipe at least after you were done?
---
I can't believe you guys have any hope for this trash game. I seriously hope they just shut the game down, seeing it's slow death is annoying.
---
Because I'm in a bad mood and want to be mad about something. I'm pissed and anything I distract myself with will piss me off more and I will associate those things with this attitude so I'm throwing a hissy fit over something stupid I'm already mad about to burn off this energy.
---
Also, I really want to like 76 but from the ground up it is a disappointing shitfest that never should have seen the light of day.
---
I guess thats why i got the reward for that quest . I was on the other side of the map at the time and newer participated :-) 
---
Mediocre is a compliment. Atrocious is more like it.
---
you have a chance of getting a plan for the weapon you're scrapping :)
---
Very cool.
---
Really? You couldn’t run up it? Super weird that I could, there’s nothing in game that should affect ability to run up slopes. I’m going to take a screenshot of exactly what I’m talking about 
---
True its only rare cause its a drop from only 2 mire events with a terrible drop rate (i think its either .005 or .20
---
Wah!
---
Yeah he sells the Hunters long coat, not the TLC
---
Isn't that a deathclaw spawn? 
---
I only see the Far side
---
As reflect in in their poor sales of 95 million copies for gta:v
---
I just chill in there base and play some instruments to gain trust
---
Atomic shop items are untradable.  If they get dropped they are also destroyed.
---
Oh no scorch beasts were made by the Enclave, they dumped the Queen in the glassed cavern because it seemed like a good place to hold her after things went bad in the bunker. Have a look through the recordings on the two archive terminals in the science wing for proof. It's why an entire wing of the bunker is rubble, that was the scorched lab and they had to purge it after the disease got loose inside the lab (MODUS mentions having to destroy it because of contamination)
---
It's 0.2 and it has been duped at some point.
---
It would be hillarious if they'll add it some point as a world drop
---
Don't bother, Bethesda doesn't bother either.  
---
Please buy something from the Atom Shop.
---
The Mire is brutal
---
Rapidly dropping junk has dropped my apparel before.
---
Reread everything you just typed. Stop projecting, life gets beter.
---
Also it's just a game. 
---
I'm also on xb1 and use to take over workshops but since the Nerf it's almost always a waste. I feel like if I take a workshop it's 100% of the time kick me with in 30mins. I think it has to do with one player having alot do times connect to them with a large camp and workshops. 
---
Which sucks because workshops could be really cool. 
---
Thanks, I'm glad you apologized. I also like this game. Quite a bit. That's why I wanted improvements but I really don't think we'll see any real improvements until around 8-12 months from now. 
---
I'm sure this game will turn around eventually, though. I just wish they were transparent about what they're doing. 
---
However, I don't think this game was a labor of love. I think the Bethesda we know did the map and the world and the rest of it was mostly handled by Battlecry.
---
I was always excited for this game but I constantly warned people about its shortcomings like many others. None wanted to listen. Now 90% of those people are gone and don't even care about what happens to the game. It's the people who've always been critical about it that care the most imo.
---
I got my money's worth. It was fun. But it's so hard to play this game and notice the missed potential everywhere.
---
Maybe I'll try a full on MMO instead of a mmo lite while they fix their shit. Who knows. 
---
getting killed isn't the problem, getting one shot killed is, and the only time that ever happens is with an explosive two shot legendary shotgun, 2 or 3 shots makes more sense depending on the body part hit 
---
I don't think it's their silence as much as Bethesda had a predetermined marketing playbook sketched out for 76 and they refuse to deviate from it even when sales tanked.
---
They did a similar thing with Doom 2016.  Everyone loved its single player campaign, but virtually all of the post-release marketing tried to hype up multiplayer.  All the paid DLC revolved around multiplayer.  Even though no one cared about that, they kept acting like it was a big deal.
---
It's easy to ignore with Doom, but with a failed release, it comes across as really tone deaf.
---
You'll be fine, you get more perk cards as you level up.
---
Hell yeah!!!
---
When duping was huge i held onto my stuff like that tightly cause you never knew if your super rare item was ginna be a common item
---
I did play if you didn't read my comment and I said the beta was trash actual game is meh
---
To piggyback off of that, there is a part that I love using in my builds, yet it irritates me to hell that I can't place it on top of foundations. The part that has the stars along with the wooden grid platforms surrounding the top.
---
I wanted to make my small 2x2 house have a porch I can snipe from or have my powerarmor on.
---
Anthem releases soon.
---
BOS Heavy Combat Armor. You put Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs and explosions do zip. I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and suffer no damage.
---
 Her screech attack is explosive. I ignore it, does nothing to me.
---
 I hunt Scrochbeasts for sport in it. The only problem PA mitigates better is Radiation.
---
missions and dlcs are more prevalent in the previous fallout games
---
It was removed
---
tbh i make low level alts so i can bait people in to giving me stuff, then I sort through it to make sure its not contraband. on the rare occasion I do see "sus" items, i dump it in a random part of the river. #doingmypart
---
Am I late because the paot was removed,
---
I've resorted to yelling "Hey, want some free stuff?" Usually, they'll stick around long enough for me to drop a paper bag and back away. I back away far enough unarmed and wave. They'll usually check the bag, then wave back. It's cute because they do it all armed and sometimes they'll point their gun at me.
---
Easiest explanation. Fast travel mats use to be a thing.
---
While i don't know a 100%, but i think that dupers don't trade it around a lot, only for other rare items, no way i'd be able to get it if it wasn't a dupe.
---
In my head, joint first for top QoL changes are
---
-Rejoin last server
---
-Greatly increase vendor caps
---
Why was it removed?
---
I found a low level at an event he won it and i aksed for it amd he said for 1k its mine it was sick 
---
No builds other than melee, no usable vats, no usable mutations, legendary drops nothing legendary.
---
At what point is this game considered fraud? I intended to buy a game, not a half-finished mess.
---
Completely agree. 15 years of gaming and never has a game been so easy to enjoy, or taken the spot as my favourite quite so certainly.
---
I unfortunately don't use a mic (I use Astros base is plugged into my PS4 and TV so I get sound but I need to get the Xbox base for them) although I don't really talk much online anyway. I think and emote would do just fine. But I see your point. 
---
I use Power Armor for only the following reasons:
---
* Nuke zones, because radiation destroys non-PA users unless you've got some obscure Perk setup (and even then...)
---
* I'm over-encumbered, want to fast travel, and don't want to drop anything.
---
* I want to jump off from a high place and don't want to risk killing myself.
---
Pretty much don't need it otherwise.
---
Ya all you’ve done is made it so you probably won’t have your exactly perfect perk load out when you hit level 50. But if you keep leveling, you will keep getting perks each level and perk packs every 5 levels. 
---
Don’t forget you can pick a perk from any special category regardless of which special stat you increased by tabbing/LR bumper/LR button on the perk screen. So you can increase strength but pick an endurance perk, for example. 
---
Stop carrying so much stuff?
---
AND ITS DELETED
---
Last night I was at Whitespring.  Showing Jr how cool dad is by beating stuff up like a caveman.  I got to that parking lot where it spawns a few ghouls, then also goes into the storage room/laundry/lunch area. So I kill one of them, he moonwalks out of the storage room through the wall, slowly of course.   I go through the area, come back around and I see him still going.  He's got no collision detection so he's passing through trees, cars.  We hit up the other homes,  swing back and there he is. Still going. So funny. Curious how far he actually ended up
---
In my personal experience, when I get disconnected from a server it's because the server has crashed entirely. It's possible to rejoin the server you were just on by joining on a player in your "Recents" list, and literally every time I've tried, none of them are in a world; which means they've been disconnected too.
---
That being said, yeah, it would be great to join on the last server you were in, if it's still up.  I think most of the time there's nothing to rejoin, though.
---
No argument there.  We need more democratized loot, not less of it.  I didn't care about how Mama Dolce's stew magically warped into my inventory - but if I knew the reward from that quest helped all players, I'd be willing to do it a lot more.
---
The new radworms bug introduced with last patch since I have a bunch of mutations. Since I can't fight ghouls anymore without disconnect / reconnect I'm only keep playing for the easy atom's daily quests and pile up enough loots to make my daily 1400 caps with vendors.
---
its sad because the thing that made your day is a sad level 118 who had literally nothing better to do than follow around a level 13 and drop him loot and log off.  
---
there's your end game Bethesda.
---
I agree. I despise the holotapes now. Every time its the same thing "Go rescue these guys! They need help"  
---
Get there, they are dead.  Search bodies. Find holotape.  
---
Gotta admit they committed 1000% to the immersion factor. The world definitely feels dead.
---
Have you picked up Dromedary? It helps. Also, if you set up water purifiers, you can stock up on purified water which quenches your thirst better than boiled water. Also, if you set up enough purifiers, you can sell the excess at vendors for a steady income of caps each day.
---
they do work as keypads to get in your base, but i had to remove alot and build too them once i got the direction right, then they have to be wired 2 times! to function as a 2 way door, and a switch box needs to be placed on the inside. 
---
  wire one goes to keypad, to open from outside. After you press the code (random generated when placing door) it will open for 5 secs and auto shut behind you. To leave you flip the inside switch and it keeps the door open unless you press it shut.
---
Deleted T-T
---
Yeah but it's a bad iron man approximation put into a destiny clone...
---
This subreddit.
---
you should go talk to a lawyer then ;)
---
Best Companion in the game!
---
I loss half my combat effectiveness in PA. It really just depends on your build on if its needed or not and even then I'm not sure it's ever 100% necessary 
---
Quote, " Previous Fallout games had 1,000 times more NPCs and dialog where this game has no dialogue or NPCs."  According to this,  previous Fallout games have zero NPCs and dialog, since they have a thousand times more than Fallout 76, and Fallout 76 has none.  We all know anything times zero equals zero.
---
i also log in for whole days and server hop and never see a single even up.  Monster Mash was up for the first time yesterday in days.  But AWOL armaments has been up almost every day.  Those have been fun because i've been getting a complete lack of starred drops in some of those legendary kills.
---
The loot tables need an overhaul 
---
I'm sure that somehow Bethesda will survive without you defending them. Hard to believe I know, but it's true.
---
Way to be a debbie downer
---
But the objective then was that the other players were going to be the "NPCs" in a way, which may sound great, but overall has failed miserably for a number of reasons:
---
* No ability to establish a main hub for players
---
* Inability to communicate long distances
---
* No text chat for those who don't have mics 
---
* server instability making holding workshops (in an attempt to make them hubs) fruitless
---
* The fact that the majority aren't going to WANT to roleplay with other players
---
I agree, that was the story.. it just failed miserably at its execution
---
&gt;not talkin about the bugs because that is completely normal at a launch.
---
I'm dumbfounded by that statement and impressed that even though you are clearly tired of this game, you will still defend it on that issue. The technical state of the game was unnaceptable and it still is. A triple-A game has absolutely no business being this buggy. It's literally spitting in the face of customers and they should be shamed for it, there is no excuse. Just out of curiosity which AAA game did you find worse?
---
PA is easier. Also its assumed you have speed demon and marsupial.
---
There was never loot boxes or pay to win implemented in any way at launch so saying “mostly implemented” is false.
---
There was no changes to how these things worked because there was never an intended use for them stated or revealed except what people speculated without any proof of what lunchboxes in the files were. They effects from events aren’t rewards it’s simply a system of if X then Y. There isn’t any viable proof or evidence of there ever being loot boxes or pay to win or the consideration of adding those things. Bethesda themselves have even said there wouldn’t be those things in game. Whether you trust them or not is irrelevant it just shows that any speculation of it being considered doesn’t have any footing. Trying to say “oh they were gonna do it but pulled back” still doesn’t have any evidence to it and is the last resort for people trying to defend the idea that loot boxes and pay to win was happening. There’s nothing to this but baseless speculation by gaming journalists and youtubers who have no evidence but unused files and speculation
---
It's sad. I really hope that the game gets fixed. I hope they dont just cut there losses and junk it. I feel like all the negative things posted tho may make them lean towards just scraping it. I enjoy the game a lot even with the bugs. If they hear more about what they did right maybe they would want to fix more of that they broke. I dont know that's just my thoughts 
---
Deleting the game and not playing has seriously reduced the amount of bugs I see.
---
Random trash legendary weapons would have a use if we could scrap and craft one time use legendary effect mod.  
---
* Scrap legendaries to get legendary flux ( furious effect turns into furious flux)
---
* A large amount of flux would be needed to craft a legendary mod.  
---
   * I would be ok if this number seemed high, say 50.  This still keeps the same need to farm weapons, but gives use to trash legendary weapons with good effects. 
---
   * This mod would be one time use.  
---
But have you collected wood 7600 times?
---
//It’s about being on your own it’s about finding out what happened to the people of West Virginia.//
---
That would be acceptable if Telltale made the game.
---
Or at least have them either refund the resource cost (including fucking gears) for the workshop if you get dropped. I don't care if I start on a diff server or not, but would be nice not to spend an hour setting up multiple camps and the fucking server crashes just as I get done settings it all up! Then I gotta spend the next few hours recouping my resources to start again. 
---
I'm lower level and definitely get nervous when a higher level ppl  come by. I've had both good and bad experiences with them to include having them blow up my generator and extractor for no reason, destroy my house, someone killed me right out of the vault the first time I played ... Or.. Someone did Give me gifts to help me.
---
It is extremely helpful when you get gifts that you don't have or that you desperately need. I'm always very grateful for that. ❤️❤️❤️(I'll gladly accept your gifts.. Lol) 
---
The reality is.... The weapons are way better than mine. But I still try to not fault others for one person's bad behavior. I still get nervous though.. Lol
---
Source? Or are pulling things out of thin air like people in this sub tend to do
---
I dont know if I get a head shot on you from stealth with my AAE lever action I expect you to die. I dont pvp much but the only time I one shot anyone is from stealth or with a vats crit.
---
I've got barbarian 3 &amp; iron clad 5, with two pieces of vanguard in my hodgepodge set of armor &amp; my DR hovers around 400, exceeding some PA and nearing my x-01. Rads still kind of break the build so I'll hop in the PA for those moments, but besides that &amp; jetpack fun I really dont use PA much at all. 
---
You're right and unravelling the mystery of what happen is interesting but:
---
- It's not written or presented well you have to fill in a lot of the gaps yourself.
---
- It gets tiresome really fast as the game keeps poking you with "oh there might be people there!" when you know damn well there isn't.
---
- You're forced to join every dead faction you find and they just happen to conveniently have an automated sign up sheet each.
---
- The game constantly bounces you two and from locations up and down the map making most of the story a walking simulator.
---
- The climax is just lets go shoot a big creature in the face with a nuke, there's no resolution because she just spawns back again and killing her makes no impact on the environment or SB problem.
---
- Nobody ever repopulates the world and with the small servers you feel completely alone in a MULTIPLAYER game without any payoff to it in the end (such as an end game only bigger server / NPC server).
---
- There's never any choices, dilemmas, or even weight to any of the story. You never have to decide anything or take a side in a conflict you just follow a bread crumb trail to the Enclave do whatever evil shit they want and then nuke'a'bitch.
---
The price of plans has been inflated so idiotically that it is once again useful to own workshops for a while.
---
I have logged out at the whitesprings station. Logged in to a scorchbeast killing me befor I could move lol
---
PC/PS4/XB?
---
maybe, but the only time it happens to me is with a shotgun, I've never done it, best weapon I've managed to farm is an explosive antiarmor handmade, i shot a level 5 times in the head before he died
---
I’ve seen the mr handy I think on a date with a miss nanny. They keep asking each other questions.
---
I sent a friend request
---
Well, they did ban people for entering that testing room, so the fear of being banned for entering these vaults in irrational. 
---
fuckthesda will spit in your face now because when TES VI will hit the market the world will go crazy
---
Zenimax's online studios was a bunch of nobodies before ESO, though. People also tend to forget that. Besides this isn't the main Bethesda studio, this is one that they acquired to develop FO76 just like Zenimax acquired the ESO studio to work solely on ESO. Besides, ESO isn't actually an Elder Scrolls game, at least we have most of a Fallout game
---
This all sounds like lies to me.
---
The whole building mechanic is stupid in Fo76. So many restriction, some dont even make sense. Non removable objects that are free of any floor, and so much more.
---
I havent seen a lot of people talk about it. 
---
I love how people actually think Bethesda is listening to Reddit.   Like they're sitting in some room like, "well Bob from Reddit suggested that we give them feature X.  We never thought of that,  and since we care so much about they're playing experience (obviously), lets go ahead and work OT to push that out!"
---
It’s not like Bethesda didn’t say there weren’t going to be any human npcs and dialogue interactions would be limited to other players. People are still complaining about things they did before the game came out and are shooting themself in the foot by still buying a game they decided they didn’t like before it even came out. 
---
That is amazing. I'm pretty sure I'd start laughing so hard I wouldn't be able to aim straight.
---
Try not to shoot your PC with it next time 😉
---
Huh. TIL about crouch hiding. Tested it last night and was surprised.
---
In my opinion, the damage is fine.  Its the "splitting" the game does with the bullets.  This was a totally unnecessary change and renders it completely useless in VATS.
---
Keep the damage, fix the accuracy.
---
You either don't farm enough, wait around for a nuke, or are truly unlucky
---
Yup, there’s something wrong with the way they attack generators, they aggro them from very far away.
---
SPACESHIP!!!
---
Hey there! Thanks again for the fun time. Sorry it took so long to confirm my suspicion! 
---
My only problem with this is cazadors don't exist yet as they are spoiler made in Big Mr.
---
https://youtu.be/PVxk3emmcfo.
---
Last few patches they were nerfing loot to increase longevity of the game, and I can clearly see the logic here, recently I finally got what I want... I have nothing to do now :(
---
Now here is a though does anyone here know or is anyone here a lawyer? is this a class actionable thing just saying lol I mean people keep making the same post but about things not just about this game but just about every new game so gamers need to do something really.
---
Eh, like others in the thread below, I've never seen trolling as inherently bad, although it often is. In this case, the guy was pranking me and it was fun. 
---
I actually will tame a pet under every circumstance.  TBH its one of the cooler features in the game if it wasn't so random to find.
---
Problem is that the only state allowed to bring them to court is California. Everyone else has to go through arbitrary which cost more money and nothing in your favor.
---
I'll probably also buy TES6, Only thing i want is them to introduce humans or something to spice up the fucking story
---
That same body of toxic water extends from the roof pool down through most the building interior. There's a door you can walk through on the second story terrace facing the east - use the diagonal pipe directly below it to jump up there.  It's pretty easy to do with marsupial although I'm not sure if it's possible without.. Once inside just jump to enter the water - it won't be visible until you're inside it but it basically fills the entire interior cell. You can then swim up to the top floor and jump over to the nest/relief thing. 
---
It's worth noting that any cell with water underneath can be explored this way provided you can with a "hole" or way to fall under the map. I've managed to explore quite a bit of the underside of the map this way although I haven't found anything super interesting. I guess this is a bit of an exploit although I don't think I've gained anything from this aside from a few wasted hours and a ton of waterborne diseases. 
---
I also think it's possible to get inside another "nest" via a missing roof piece on the Watago municipal services building although it would require a jetpack which I lack. I won't be on until later today but I'm happy to show you any of this stuff if you're on PC.
---
One last thing - I did look up the statues and cult shrines in the game files and think you've found everything. I can give some other insights on this based on my interpretation but I don't want to spoil anything in case this feels too much like looking behidn the curtain. For example, see the following for the Interloper's file name and layer description. I'm not sure what to make of it but tt made me laugh. https://imgur.com/a/68n9gy3
---
To be honest, finding the Interloper is sort of what drove to start digging into the game files as I wanted to see WTF that thing is about. I had my own moment of Lovecraftian horror when I first found it and though it was just some small squid-like thing and then OH FUCK THAT'S ITS KNEE OVER THERE as it moved slightly. It reminded me of the part in the Shunned House where the narrator is digging and finds a "soft tube bent in half, two-feet in diameter" and then realizes it's somethings below. 
---
Happy hunting!
---
In my book, trolling has never been inherently bad, although it often is. This guy was great.
---
The constant disconnected from server whenever I would exit a building or fast travel, I'm only sticking around to see if they say they fixed server stability in the next patch. If they don't I'll probably just drop the game all together. 
---
That's still not a massive amount of work. They've built the system, they should know the answers to most of those questions. They should have a desired TTK or difficulty they're aiming for. That's where testing comes in. It's not going to take forever to test that. And with Bethesda's recent track record of 'testing', does it really appear that they're doing THAT much in-depth testing?
---
PC need one for hunting rifle 
---
I know I got hit with it only while fighting the queen. That 25% or 50% (I cant remember ) to range attacks crippled me.
---
Thank you
---
At what point during F76's release did bethesda show that they care about playerS?
---
I kept ultracite plans for a while to count how many queens were farmed, I had 107 explosive vents at one point.
---
Is this just a rat thing?  Had a rad rat horde that spawned me in a silo last week, really wouldn't think they would be in interior zones.
---
Thanks for the reply !!! Ill try to do that.
---
Should I just delete Fallout76prefs.ini ???
---
I am still happily playing. 
---
I think you are going to be disappointed when they launch in game and are exactly as complete then as they are now. Just like basically every other part of the game. 
---
This happens to me to every time I show up in my clown outfit with a sack on my head.  They just run I just want to be friends. 
---
You know I don't care that my cowboy hat doesn't offer me any protection. I wear my cowboy hat because I'm a goddamn cowboy. 
---
All the points
---
Is Google broken?
---
This is what testing is for. Bethesda Austin have been extremely poor at testing their changes and the effects. They make it look infinitely more difficult than it is because of their own incompetence. There are issues that literally everyone experiences. This underlines the ineffectiveness of whatever process they're going through with their testing. It's like there's no communication between the people working on changes and the people testing the changes.

I APPLAUDED IT FOR BEING DIFFERENT!
---
Me and my friends spent one of the last 2h betas almost entirely on getting rid of junk by building a little fortified house at one of the claimable spaces just to be able to freekin move again... only for the whole thing to be gone next time we were able to log in. We only played ones or twice after the release and haven’t touched the game since. Nice to know, that they did something about that limit but since there are no private servers yet and all the gankers and griefers are probably sitting on tons of nuke codes we will probably wait until that happens. Thanks for letting me know though friend :)
---
Yeah a dlc for each quarter. That's how most games operate. 1 year 4 dlcs that's 1 every 3 months.
---
Just watched the video. I remember him from the last fallout. None the less do you know howd get get over the building limit?
---
My current place has no defense (lie, 1 artillery) but I had to shrink it and cut down on my decorations and lights because I blew my budget.  And honestly my budget was glitch as my large purifier wouldn't delete and when they fixed they I have 6 saved so that freed up space.
---
Make sure you have fire proof perk equipped ;)
---
In that case. I'm gonna find a New place. Can You recommend a place.? 
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaahahahahahahaahhaaha
---
sorry, no
---
Dang... I need that texture pack!  😜
---
Jheez dude, you sure you ain't speaking about yourself? It's a game step back for a minute and breathe 
---
No. 
---
O k... so how about someone... clarify... what IS the right info... on this matter? Thanks smh... 
---
They actually said they would only make dlc IF there are enough players? 
---
I agree with basically everything you said. Although if they do bring in npcs, they shouldn't be human. Maybe add ghouls, more super mutants, or robots with human minds. I do like how there are no humans in the game, and to change that design (what makes 76 unique) would be bad and weird, and also unlikely to happen. 
---
Have you ran? You have ran? I guess I know what this game's target audience is.
---
An inconvenient truth. 
---
I had this happen at Fort Defiance on my most recent straight jacket run. It was sliding across the floor in its idle animation before finally going through a wall. I also noticed ghouls that would "respawn" while I was still going through their inventory, but as others mentioned, after respawning they were just stuck laying on the ground in their pre-alerted state.
---
Thanks for posting this. Thank god. Your unique and varied opinions,  and hard work regurgitating long known issues has saved the game.  
---
That looks awesome! No one without marsupial could get in. I am mole rats could probably glitch in though. 
---
Ha!  Yeah, that has crossed my mind.
---
Yea I'm not playing anymore due to the TSE nerf. Nothing like spending all your time building up for the meta. Spending thousands of caps to get the weapon and then have it all be worthless. 
---
This is one of the features that has been requested on a nearly daily basis since launch. Has there been any response from Bethesda?
---
Skinner box
---
U lie. Either that or u live in hick-land. 
---
Well, I have my CAMP on a lead deposit in the Savage Divide. It's in the woods just north of Huntersville. It good because it produce lead and is convenient to both Whitesprings and West Tek for all my farming needs. Nothing is ever there at log in, but it gets attached occasionally, but just by wolves or radrats.
---
Do you realize how stupid and spoiled it sounds to sue a company because you don't like their video game?
---
The product isn't perfect but we've all gotten hundreds of hours out of it. They owe us hug fixes and content not refunds.
---
Strange.  I don’t seem to have any of those issues.  
---
I think you are overstating the prevalence of griefers. At least in my experience. Are they a thing? Sure. But they are a very small minority of players. "World of griefers" makes it sound like it's just an all day every day anarchy fest. 
---
That's not what I think about this game... I think bethesda is doing good at trying to save this game from the tragedy that was the launch. This post is just a bit of criticism against a nerf.
---
And once you do manage to spawn him, you damn sure aren't getting back into that server without a friend.
---
Yup. They still chime in frequently. 
---
Or it's me trying to come up with a witty title and failing miserably. 
---
I probably should stop carrying a grognaks axe and wearing the tattered mole head when I do this 
---
Thanks dude. Appriciate the help. Good gonna relocate my camp, take care!! 
---
where do you go to trade online? I remember talks about players wanting an area dedicated to trade, has one been established now?
---
Wow, Amazing! Do I upgrade at the machine? Anything about your build you would change 2 months on?
---
I'm still enjoying it, but I'm only lvl 53 I think and have not approached end game yet.  Playing around with all the mutations as of yesterday has been super fun.
---
Yea, they typically dont work weekends. Filter by top, week, and there's over 25 flaired beth responded posts....
---
I find it better to log out at whitesprings resort.
---
 No its not. Its the most wonderful place in the game. 
---
 Every time I get to the northwestern part of Berkley Springs and drop into the Mire on my way home I breath a sigh of relief. Down into the dense undergrowth with who knows what lurking there. My home. ;) 
---
Unless you spawn into a nuke lol
---
Did hell freeze over? 
---
I'm 1 for 4 on SBQ tries.  Never have to worry about loot if you fail to kill her.
---
But none of those things are major game breaking problems!  
---
It's like you're not even listening!  
---
For me (level 37), it helps if you do the "come here" emote and shoot at where the bag is. 
---
That said, I wish we had a "wait!" emote or something. 
---
I can definitely see the logic in the plan, but it still seems relatively flawed to me.  There's still no shortage of ways to enjoy the game, through random quests/events and general exploration.  I've largely finished out my build, but I still have a good chunk of the map to wander around in.  I guess I've learned my lesson at this point: don't bother with the blast sites.
---
I do, but again, I did say LOL AND NOT JUST THIS GAME. Meaning that we as gamers can not rant about game been bad and getting worse each release when we just keep giving them money for them. And now they even want to charge for alpha access!!!??? But I guess that makes sense to you right?
---
Sure I'm in gt vespaboy1975
---
I havent had any connection issues for a while now. Did you try power cycling your modem?
---
I honestly just got bored. Put in a few hundred hours. Started playing other games   Will come back soon to see what all this patch nonsense is about 
---
next time you kill her you should run like crazy. 
---
So another words you didn’t even read the post before you just decided to talk shit.
---
You should just join a roleplay community! Fallout 76 is a thousand times for fun when you're playing in character.
---
We don't need NPCs if we're making the story ourselves. It's a blast :)
---
+ karma 
---
Lmao love the sarcasm but so true, in the 3 months its been out, not a single must have atom shop item has come out. The one consistent thing I keep seeing people want but Bugthesda hasn't put in the store yet.. WALLS. Especially clean walls.
---
Did you find your disease?

Yes but are they doing anything besides nerfing...since that's all they really know how to get right
---
In other words, Bethesda didn't finish the game before releasing horseshit.
---
&gt; We've passed on your feedback to the team.
---
I’d be happy if I could just scrap my huge piles of awful legendaries for something that would eventually let me craft a good one. 
---
I started a new Vegas playthrough with a totally new build. Forgot what a fallout RPG was. I keep picking up trash everywhere I go before realizing it is useless.
---
I have beat the game several times but never with house or the legion so still plenty to do.
---
Everything that I have read since the patch indicates that they have been removed from vendor inventory.
---
The no damage bug was a big downer in  the vital stage of a quest.
---
Haha. Fair enough. I do know what it means. Not the best use case here. But, I’m right, right? The game is bad. Even if people like it. It’s a bad fallout game. I think it’s okay to like bad things but you have to be honest with yourself at some point. 
---
I take that one on the chin tho. You can’t throw around a word like “objectively” on reddit and not have someone with a bigger better brain call you on it. GG. 
---
I usually visit Vault 94 after every patch to watch it get more and more complete.
---
I don't use any software I just glitch through the walls with the power armor.
---
Pretty sure the Vaults don't trigger a ban.
---
I imagine the game flags you if you're traveling faster than possible, as in, teleporting due to hacks.
---
That's actually why fast travel takes a certain time, it literally makes you invisible and moves you through the map at a certain speed.
---
The dev room is located dead center of the map several hundred units down, no way anyone gets there without hacking the player location to teleport. And that triggers the ban hammer. 
---
1 - No, unless a code walker has found something I dont think there are any solid numbers or %s anywhere for the various mod %s. 2 yes 3 yes
---
I only use it if I’m overencombered, in a nuke zone, or in a place I’m scared of. 
---
oh shut up
---
this gamer knows how to riiiiise up. it wasn't a single player fallout 5, where's out  fat dlc's after 3 months, 
---
So big you'll rarely see other players! Unless you go to one of the 3 places worth going.
---
Cheers! FYI if you take that spot it's a quick run to Huntersville. If you're a high enough level there's a chance a legendary Mutant will spawn in the hardware store there. It's easy to sneak in through the back and pick him off if he's there. I usually check it about once a day, it's about a 50-50 chance.
---
Yep! I've been having a great time with this story. My friends and I play in character, we started a roleplay community (though its crazy tiny hahaha) and it makes the game so much more fun. 
---
"Who executed all these people?" is a mystery I've been enjoying since emerging from the Vault :)
---
Hit me up if you want pointers on how to get into 94 :) 
---
Found nothing thus far, it's a bit worrying.
---
this subreddit, making me aware of what type of people I was actually playing the game with. Ew and no thanks lol.
---
Dang if only Todd Howard said “YOU make your own story” at E3 when they announced no NPCs, :\ then maybe people would’ve not purchased it if they wanted NPCs
---
Try putting all ingredients in the stash
---
It works it makes a weird beeping noise 
---
Hey the game has flaws, but we can't forget that Todd promised a glow in the dark map for our camp in the atomic shop, and we got it.  So have faith. 
---
They seem to have moved on as people just didn't give them the in game attention they need to exist. 
---
Same as officers with silo codes?
---
oh cook, another shit post from our resident shit poster.
---
I use the FO76 discord and subreddit, but also I ask people in the Whitesprings crafting corner if they wanna trade, made more than a few deals that way, a couple of friends too. Whitesprings can be used as a nice little rest stop like that, and it's also right next to one of the best farming locations
---
It's because just like for players, the DR system is this game is complete trash, that basically invalidates low damage high RoF weapons while being useless against big slow hits.
---
&gt;Just out of curiosity which AAA game did you find worse?
---
Battlefield 4 was the worst goddamn cluster fuck I've ever endured on release. It was horrible for at least a year. Constant server issues, bugs, people losing all progress randomly. Also people like to forget that FO New Vegas was insanely bad at launch. Many bugs. Skyrim was also out of commission for an entire month. Bugs come with releases. I think they even add flavor because we can laugh at them. Some are so funny. The ghouls with arms out that are frozen and drift around like they're pinned to the cross, for example lmaooo
---
I took a selfie in 94, does that count? :P
---
https://imgur.com/a/aqpK5QW
---
Also the terminal text at my link is hilarious, they obviously expected us to poke around :) 
---
Everyone keeps adding the argument “but it’s a different team working in the atom shop wah wah wah quit crying”. But at the end of the day it’s still Bethesda employing this team to keep adding things to the atom shop. Bethesda is still taking the time and resources to encourage a seperate team to milk customers for money. Instead of adding more to the development team instead of adding focus on improving the game. They are still the ones ultimately out here telling a different team hey were rich but we need you to keep making us more money. End of the day Bethesda investors and CEO are just a bunch of greedy pieces of shit and the entire videogame industry is going down the toilet because of things like this.
---
I never said there was zero, so nice try. 
---
There is so big map, so many locations but everything is so empty (compared to any other fallout). Whenever I found something new I go to explore with hope to discover something interesting and every time it's just a note or holotape that can be summarised as: 'i lived and died here, the end'
---
No not exactly but about to the rhythm, the noise itself is pretty annoying and should be easily noticeable.
---
2nd on I wish I had the patience for that. Great detail. Very impressive!
---
Nah, bruh, carnivore. Meats have all the buffs I crave, +str, agi, end, luck, +melee damage, + damage resistance. Having to kill things to get meat isn't a good argument against it. I'm killing things anyway. That's the main gameplay activity. Going around collecting crops and plants just to get veggies is adding a chore just to get food. Going and clearing uranium fever and ending up with a couple dozen glowing meat is just getting food for free for doing what I was going to do anyway.
---
 LOL. Another Excavator Bee.
---
I usually turn them around 180 degrees for every piece.
---
They don't snap and you can place them like you want, even intersect them
---
I mean, yeah, we all know the art guy designing the items isn’t the same guy supposedly working on content. 
---
I’m just saying the art guy’s hard work could actually be used relatively easily to give us a little more content here and there. 
---
Had that happen. a level 50-something demanding a trade and requesting my All-Rise. When I told him flat out he wasn't getting it and went back to trading with the vendor, I heard him getting into power armour. I was done trading by that point, so I fast-travelled to the other end of the map before the idiot did something stupid. If he wanted the All-Rise, he should've done the quest for it.
---
it makes the same noise as Fortune Finder but instead of it ending with the sound of caps falling it sounds like someone angrily changing pages in a magazine 
---
This has happened several times. 
---
Thanks for the offer! I'll keep it in mind for if/when the heat dies down for this :P
---
Hurr hurr durr!  Watch me circle-jerk with unfunny jokes!
---
I just discovered this today, before coming here, and was going to post. Nice to see someone else spotted it!
---
I thought this was hilarious as well!
---
I've had two experiences (on PC, if that makes a difference) with someone who wouldn't take the hint and kept slap-damaging me even after fast-traveling to get away and politely declining PvP over the mic. Once way back in the. BETA and once last night. That hardly seems like an epidemic, especially compared to the number of people who've tried to engage, and went elsewhere after I didn't got back or said no thanks. It's easy enough to block them, fast travel away (not to your CAMP, obviously) or just server hop and leave them to their own devices. 
---
Sometimes burrowing enemies get stuck underground.
---
Green Thumb + Super Duper took care of the Flux needs. Just leaves the other ingredients. Easily got 75 crimson from a FSP nuke, far more than I needed. 
---
Nothing sexier than Super Duper hitting while making serums. Got a healthy back up stash of speed demon &amp; marsupial incase I mess up &amp; remove rads w/o starched genes active. 
---
Bobblehead perk makes a cartoonish wobbling sound
---
Game design, PvP meant smashing camps in this game, plus YouTubers are showing camp smashing as a lot of fun.
---
I'm amused about the fact that you've written a short essay detailing exactly what everyone else has been pointing out since the beta and suspecting even before that. I shouldn't be telling you how to spend your money, but unless you enjoy throwing it away, I advice you to be a bit more skeptical towards AAA companies and their bs. Starting with that statement right there about bugs and issues during launch being the norm and therefore acceptable. 
---
I was looking directly on magazine and heard no sound. Idk gona do some testing :))
---
Is it only server health that slows down the loot?  It sometimes feels like if I’m the guy who takes the final shot that kills her it loads immediately,  but if I’m not helping much in that final push, but I had earlier in the fight it loads after a long time, and if I wasn’t much help or everything I did was before her healing, I get nothing 
---
Maybe it’s superstition, but I feel like when she’s dies the system goes backwards over the list of people who hit her, and gives loot based on that, and it either fails or gives up at some point in the process. 
---
Right. I didn't think the problem was as big as people make it seem. I guess it's just the small number of people posting about it try and make it seem like a bigger problem 
---
Funny, I agree with you again, I have posted the same, lol and that was my point but real something does need to be done, I live well what should be 25 mins. from where this game was made could have worked for them back in the day many years ago. Don't blame the DEV's they are guys that just work for a pay check, it's the "shrimp eaters" in offices that write their checks that are making all the bad things happen, but we still let them do it bottom line. IF the game don't sell, they don't vacation in places we can't go.
---
Either stupid or feeling lucky I took a chance and bought the HUD yesterday..put in about 9 hours so far and not a single glitch...PS4
---
TIL your fusion generator and machines in general draw in enemys.  This is interesting too, i have my base VERY close to harpers and has rarely been attacked although the city usually has lots of mutants,  Wonder if thats helping me so far?
---
I had a different experience. I set my camp up next to an area that spawned super mutants so every time I logged in or went back to my camp I had an opportunity to kill a bunch. This allowed me to accumulate a steady flow of experience each day even if I only logged in for an hour or so. The super mutants got progressively harder too, so I wasn't stuck killing very low level mobs. I also participated in events whenever I got the chance for some additional experience. Setup your camp with these things in mind and gaining levels will become easier.
---
I spent an hour trying to give away unique low level gear through messaging and what not. Resulted in me dropping a bunch of low level uniques in the middle of my camp cause what else you supposed to do when you reach the stash and personal limits of shit but are in a crafting game where all that shit is necessary.
---
Bethesda needs to look into different storage mechanisms for the stash. you could in theory host in a seperate database and integrate to it using other servers instead of your main load bearing ones running current game. think of the stash like a business intellegence data warehouse, unless you're lookr then you need that seperated to do any kind of processing , calcs or analytics on it otherwise performance is doomed.
---
I use it every day so it does work, might be bugged on your instance but I built near a spawn point for magazines and often have to unequip because it gets very annoying 
---
Unfortunately mods are a one way trip, if you try to replace an installed one it'll vanish. 
---
Impossible 
---
Would love to see that implemented might actually come back and play again. Had to many disconnects/crashes that cheated me out of loot and workshops so haven't played this game for awhile now.
---
It’s strange, I’ve never had people come after me, everyone I’ve bumped across is super nice and supportive.
---
Most of your points are valid except melee being the only build. I dont agree with that there are other builds that work just fine.
---
I think you can get that mod though. Pretty sure I had one. I forget where I got it, but you could try all the vendors. 
---
Get yourself a set of t51b pa and good 2 handed melee weapon and silo will be easy.
---
Hang around whitespring 
---
I’m sure they don’t want it going free to play, but it will eventually 
---
This is how i usually feel
---
Im with you i always run solo i dont like to team up
---
That one is a different reference, I think to a comedy routine. For the life of me I can't remember what though, and I should know because I looked it up when I found them too 😐 somebody help us out here!
---
good mindset m8.
---
Ha. I've had this experience. 
---
Lately (since nobody seems to use voice for xbox) I'll first do the friendly ::wave:: emote. Then proceed to talk to myself aloud "Gee golly I have stuff like plans diluted chems basic food legendary low level weapons and ammo that I'm going to offload into this suitcase/cabinet/cash register/overseers stash" ::come over here:: emote, dump stuff, shoot at the container, ::wave:: ::thumbs up::
---
It's worked 98% of the time. 
---
Honestly you no life the game and did everything that’s kinda your fault I find it funny when ppl say I’m level 100+ with over 300 hours Bethesda needs to add content in. I’m like lol no they don’t you seriously need to go take a break and do something else 
---
did you get All Rise too early?
---
Best questions get downvotes
---
One of their official accounts said they had some surprise pve coming with the survival update. 🤷‍♂️
---
I thought in the newest update you could take mods off and you wouldn’t lose them Idk tho haven’t played it since 
---
why on earth do you have 2k steel?
---
Put the materials you need in your inventory, that should work, crafting from stash is broken for a few weeks now.
---
If you get that perception perk where you can see enemy damage resistences, you can do a before and after calculation to figure out exactly how much it reduces armor. 
---
They should stack in order of highest to lowest armor reduction. Anti armor legendary prefix and tank killer together reduce armor by a total of 68%. So if the enemy has 100 armor, you take 50% of that for the prefix, resulting in 50 remaining armor, then 36% of 50, resulting in 32 remaining armor.
---
We would appreciate any testing you do with the stinging magazine. 
---
Ah thanks 
---
Any time there's backlash from reddit and the game is considered a bomb the developers abandon it. Look at star wars bf2.  Stop killing games reddit. 
---
I think irony is the unexpected.
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
Positive post on fallout 76 Reddit this won’t last long 
---
Bethesda isn’t looking to argue with strangers on Reddit, they’re listening to your feedback and working on it. Actions speak louder then words, and this game is massive. But keep shitting on it, I’m sure it’s very encouraging to their team.
---
Weird flex. 
---
No I got a level 50 version just got a better super sledge I want to put the mod on 
---
Your mom. She broke me right in half GOOD GAWD I HAD A FAMILY
---
Only one patch really reintroduced any serious bugs back into the game and that was an internal error they likely won’t make again as I’m sure they were stupefied by what happened and sorted it out immediately. They also hot fixed a few of the annoyances that patch caused a few days later.
---
We need local text chat in game! 
---
That's me... 
---
"I wish I could find someone with a mic, I wanna play with someone!"
---
*Finds said person, they try to buddy up*
---
"Sir, are you lost?" *Wonders off to do my own thing*
---
Yes
---
Welcome to fallout.
---
I believe the counter to this would be to daily/weekly/monthly challenges to get the Atom Shop offers you’d like. It’s already implemented in the game as a way to earn Atoms
---
Exactly bring in the Log cabin building set with a fire place options and trophy animal heads for the walls a hunting cabin style. I would be fine even if it was in the atom shop option.
---
Level 102... 😅
---
I’ll have to check that out. 
---
Crops and plants are at your camp, and never run out, especially with green thumb. Buffs are only needed if your build doesn’t have them, which means you’re good if your build isn’t trash. Meat doesn’t restore thirst so you still have to double up somewhere which means more weight. And again, if you use speed demon, your thirst goes very fast, so two birds is always better
---
Fix your build and get herbivore
---
I don't get how they've said nothing.....
---
Inside the vaults have been pretty consistent for a while and spot on for timing when they've said they were going to release something. 
---
They've said their working on a road map. 
---
I mean when you say "They've literally said nothing" .....
---
It literally makes me wonder if you know what the definition of literally is.
---
I'm usually in the skeleton costume with a sacrificial machete. They just take off or hurry and fast travel away lol. I'm just trying to be nice.
---
I don’t mind it it’s just the timing was really bad. I just had my plans for how I wanted my time to go and teaming up just wasn’t part of it. 
---
Lol I haven't played it in ages and am a gal in her 30s.  Def own my own home and have a career but people with replies like this are just as easily assumed to be the same so honestly this comment is no better than mine.  Welcome my friend.
---
Kind of new to me but I had the mothman show up more than once in the space of the same day at my camp that's located east of harper's ferry at the titanium node. I set up a couple missile turrets. 
---
It was funny coming across a dusted pile to find some stuff to loot. scrapped mothman wing = ballistic fiber. 
---
The 50% Anti-Armor Legendary effect is the bee's knees.
---
It doesn't matter, if they have voice chat turned off or if they are on the wrong channel they cant hear your.
---
Dang. I think they just fucked up the plan rates completely. I have the heavy raider chest but no others
---
More emotes are needed, many of them should be free.
---
oh, ok...
---
Someone invited me to a party this one time, and i server hopped to avoid saying "sorry im busy". Our generation, i swear. Lol
---
Projecting implies these are my issues.  I'm a gal in her 30s, has a house I own, a career and in good shape so sorry, not any of the things I claimed these idiots are.
---
I knew my comment would get downvotes but my opinions arent defined by views of those likely guilty of what I claimed above.
---
I just think most toxic gamers are fat, sad losers.  Sorry.  Not liking facts doesn't change them.
---
nope I actually didn't suggest every crash happens cause of that I said MOST 
---
that said 90% of my game I'm on with friends when its a solo crash one of us is kicked from game happens every few days when its exploits all 2-4 of us get removed same time - we often team in 4 player teams so we can chat so were not even in the same area of map but well over 85% of the time all of us get ejected from the shard at the same time 
---
so lets just say for example half of servers going down are caused by exploits - if there was a rejoin function (which there is if you get kicked and are in a team - play with team auto rejoins the server) it would work half the time or less so why not simply start with the exploits removes half the crashes once they are fixed then add the rejoin - and if I'm right and 85% or more times its cheaters causing the issue then you would get 1 in 10 crashes meaning going from a few a week to 1-2 a month making it far more smooth of a game 
---
My lvl 50 popped before my lvl 25 cheevo. 
---
I’m level 100... something (I don’t pay attention lol) and I hate PA. I’m specced to be stronger in regular armor, so wearing it actually makes me weaker and drops my carry capacity. I’m cautious in nuke zones with a hazmat suit (and being a sniper helps with that) but I’m still effective.
---
There are some perks that are armor related that boost stats for non-PA users. Those are the ones you want to be looking at. :)
---
Dude. 
---
Take a break.
---
That’s a LOT of gaming.
---
I couldn't put the uplink in my stash, but was able to drop everything else in there and it worked. Thanks!
---
3rd disconnect in 1 hour in site of Taggerdy in th Glassed Cavern
---
Haven't seen anything this bad in my time playing (I'm not saying it doesn't happen though). Worst I've had was someone who used the revenge option one too many times.
---
Are you guys who are experiencing this on console? I'm on PC and I've there are more assholes on console.
---
I'd love to be able to use the plaster side of brick walls outside instead of inside. But I cant even do that, =(
---
Which is why you use a water pump for boiling water of course. Purified water is for chems really, not drinking
---
 Add 3 levels of Incisor and it carves up Super Mutant Overlords like Molerats. ;)
---
I'm on Xbox, should have led with that. I've been kicked out of this game at least a hundred times through crashes or freezes or disconnects. I've had the power armor thing happen 6 times just this morning alone. My light stops working and if I'm overencumbered in a dark area I have to just drop a bunch of  the weapons or junk I looted so I can fast travel and that only fixes it sometimes. Literally the glitchiest game I've ever played on and console or PC. I have so many clips of this game screwing up and breaking... 
---
This is what gets me. There’s so many single game players that play this game petrified of running into anyone. The amount of times I am joyous that I found a CAMP and just need to scrap all my junk, and… poof. They bail on the server. It’s nonsense. And workshops… they are there to claim, defend, and take over.  Don’t claim a Workshop if you’re not prepared to defend it against a player. Yes, there’s griefing, but 90% of it is just people playing an online game within the rules. 
---
Did you just suggest they scrap everything they have and rebuild this game from the literal ground up in one year?
---
Mainly because I'm not sure what to keep and what to get rid of. Storing all of my junk (minus the uplink) in my stash and then crafting the uplink made it work.
---
i was just trying to shittalk the game
---
Agreed. Once you get out of the Forrest, veggies arent as plentiful, but meat is damn near everywhere. 
---
Plus some of the meats fill half a food bar at a time. 
---
They've been working on a road map for over a month. How hard is it to create a road map? Sounds like they are trying to buy themselves enough time to bullshit the players and "market" the game so it seems like there'll be more to do than there actually is. If they had some new content planned, it wouldn't be hard for them to come right out and tell us what to expect in the future. 
---
Earlier this week. One cool thing for reference:
---
https://twitter.com/PreciousJerbear/status/1092624605771112449?s=19
---
You do realise grahm is immortal don't You? People have kept him busy as a nuke dropped on top of him and he came out unscathed
---
no I haven't payed any of the fallout series
---
I have Speed Demon (or which ever mutation increases hunger and thirst rate) and I swear I don't have to eat and drink as much as you guys do. Which makes me think it's a bug, that just doesn't effect everyone.
---
workshops come with preloaded resources why you see green numbers just don't spend over the green numbers and you don't need to recoup as there is no loss 
---
&gt;I'm amused about the fact that you've written a short essay detailing exactly what everyone else has been pointing out since the beta 
---
Funny how you advise me to be more skeptical towards AAA but seemingly don't know that using a beta as an indicator for a game is a very poor decision. Beta is literally the testing arena for the game. How are you supposed to know what the game is going to be like or how the developers are going to react several months down the road after release? No one knew at all that they were going to ghost the players......
---
Games sales rarely reflect the workers salaries and vacations. But I get where you're coming from.  Sure the devs in Austin are trying their best with what they've got. Who knows though really.  Maybe they don't give two shits and are barely working on the game. Or maybe they are working tirelessly. Or maybe just 9 to 5 like normal people . Who knows .
---
A mega super behemoth! One that is twice the size of a behemoth and has a dump truck rear end for shoulder pad.
---
With how much effort was put into the last patch, fixing the aftermath and last Dev communication, it literally isn't going anywhere anytime soon.
---
 Mine hits at 135 or so, swings fast and as it ignores Armor is a devastating melee weapon. I kill Scorchbeats with it all the time. Finished 3 level 80s at The Whitespring a few days a go.  ;)
---
If they accidentaly die, try eat bit of that sweet corpse. 
---
yeah I play in a team and most of the time our entire team is kicked same instance its normally because someones duping and move to many items at once and boom entire server failure wiping it - so there is no where to return to 
---
what we need is more strict ban hammering of dupers and better patches to seal those up first since they are the cause of many if not most crashes 
---
How about instead of increasing the caps just make them not connected to each other? I would prefer that.
---
I heard that too. Must be false or its not known how yet
---
I stupidly spent caps on Adrenal Reaction not realizing Healing Factor would conflict. So basically I get no benefit from Adrenal since between Healing Factor and a regenerating armor piece I'm usually in good shape.
---
Marsupial and Speed Demon as everyone else mentioned. Plus I have Eagle Eyes and Electrically Charged, the latter of which is great against low level Scorched who try to wack me on the head with their stupid pickaxes.
---
If I could do it over again without losing favorites, I'd ditch Eagle Eyes and Adrenal Reaction. FYI I have Class Freak 2.
---
&gt;Bethesda isn’t looking to argue with strangers on Reddit
---
Who said anything about arguing?? Providing an update for what is coming in the future is not arguing. That's giving us the common courtesy to know what it is we should stick around for. 
---
&gt;Actions speak louder then words
---
They said that they are working on a roadmap for over a month. You're telling me that it takes a multimillion-dollar company more than 2 months to come up with a list of what they are planning and use graphic design to make it look cool? it took me 15 minutes to make this list of things I find frustrating about the game. Their roadmap could be as simple as a list. But nope. Nothing. Nothing at all. Because it's painfully evident they are not planning anything
---
In a game with no monthly fee I don't mind paying for DLC, I pretty much ignore the Atom store as is, just used free atoms for a PA skin so I could tell them apart in inventory.
---
Go through the mistress of mysteries story line, just doing that will get you 3-4 or 5 levels.
---
pretty positive only a small portion show up here
---
Yeah the Germans neglected to learn from the 1812 disaster of Napoleon. 
---
honestly a lot of the content is not quests so don't take a break just pick a direction and start running and exploring 
---
What's in my comment was anything even remotely stated? Can you read?
---
It was stated by the devs early on that DLC would be free and that the Atom store would support the game, so it kind of implies that if the atom store is not generating revenue then it is less likely we see meaningful DLC.
---
I had over 100 hours of fun, so i can can´t say it is a bad game. But the game is not made to be played for ever in its current state. For now I am waiting for new content. I only have issues with the slow updates and missing roadmap.
---
Rejoining the last server you were on by using the Recent players list only works on Xbox. It doesn't work on PC. I don't know about PS4.
---
The only place it's going is the bargain bin 
---
Shia Labeouf
---
Nice try murderer!
---
I’m sure we could make your list even longer lol.
---
"First, arbitrary PVP implemented into the design."
---
PvP is a good thing, it can provide easy content.  PvP isn't the problem, the complete lack of balance and the way they implemented "antigriefing" results in more griefing for unwilling participants, thats the problem.
---
"Second, the lack of any NPCs."
---
This is just opinion, I loved the lack of human NPCs, it added to the feeling of "wasteland" for me.  I'm not opposed to them adding them later if they get around to actual world building.  But for me, they won on this gamble.
---
"Third, extremely watered down piss poor story. Previous Fallout games had 1,000 times more NPCs and dialog where this game has no dialogue or NPCs. "
---
Complete lack of content compared to other fallout games IS A HUGE PROBLEM, being online does not excuse them from this.  It was just a massive fuck up on their part to release the game with what amounts to a few months of content even for a casual player.
---
"Finally, the biggest flaw is Bethesda's silence."
---
They've actually said quite a lot, it was just nothing you wanted to hear so I suppose you ignored it.  You can't expect them to answer every little question.  They've told you what they were working on, communication isn't their issue.  Now if you said something along the lines of poor and unproductive workflow, unresponsive to real community wants/needs then I could agree with you.
---
If you compare the weapon legendaries that increase damage, TS was waaaaaay out there compared to everything else (there's instigating, but it's only at full health, not every shot). 
---
I only wish it was like this from the start, so most of this drama wouldn't be a thing.
---
I haven’t gotten anything but ammo and trash from that quest in a long time but I keep doing it. I’m beginning to think they’d removed the plan drops from it entirely. 
---
Cool thanks
---
Ive was guilty once of luring SBs to a players camp. They had been griefing and were wanted but they were rolling with two friends (all higher levels than I and i was 140 at the time) so i tracked them back to a camp they had near a fissure site...got a three spawn and watched their camp get obliterated. They left after i tried to spawn one more once all three were dead.
---
Aside from the bloodied build I have all cards in rifleman and all card in punching 
---
Same. As a solo-player myself, I always feel bad having to ignore people wanting to trade and team &amp; whatnot. 
---
I've gone through a person's inventory before and not wanted anything, then felt bad about it lol. 
---
Now, I just do a wave and walk or run away hoping they get the hint. It's not them, it's me. 
---
honestly the only time I ever had anyone randomly attack me was back on day 2 of the beta - I've had my base shot up once and I'm not sure if it was a player or some super mutants 
---
I've had a few people run up and hit me and I waved at them and after a few moments they walked off 
---
honestly I'm sure some people have had issues but the only real pvp I've had was when I was goofing off with friends or random people I was talking with 
---
I don't doubt it. This stuff is just so basic to me... the power armor thing is a pain in the ass and it's a major headache when you spend 120 plastic making bulk things and then hit scrap all and it's all back to the way it was. Such simple things....
---
&gt;Have you wondered why there focus with every update seems to be the Atom Store? It's because there are a shitload of people spending their money in it and enjoying(?) the game quietly.
---
I'd be very interested to see the numbers behind your assumptions.  How much money are they really bringing in with this game on a regular basis?  How much development time can it justify?  I don't think you know that, but I sure don't.
---
I'm hoping they raise the cap with each DLC.
---
There's something to be said for the incompleteness of dictionaries in real usage and the nature of a living language, but respect for backing up your argument. Noted.
---
Normally that's a fine suggestion in any other Fallout game. But 76 is so empty when you really go exploring. 
---
A lot of cool locations with hardly anything to find or do
---
Again, another example. Betas are not betas as they were 20 or even 10 years ago. AAA betas as they are released now are for all intent and purposes the actual game in its final launch form. If there's changes made they're extremely minor. Do you honestly believe that a "beta" that comes out a month before a game is released is sufficient time for developers to take in feedback from the players and make the changes that need to be made in time? "Betas" by AAA now days are nothing more than an opportunity for company to advertise their game to you for a very low cost. I mean no disrespect but I'm going to guess that you're relatively young and haven't seen the industry change. 
---
Yeah workshops are the only time iv really had to fight people. I dont look for pvp most of the time
---
I find soup helps can munch it between fights I have a stack of it I recharge hp with between fights
---
also chems like stimpacks drop thirst really fast so its double draining 
---
Xbox.

---
Right?? Lol, or those times where your friends' list friends join your server and find you in-game &amp; you're like 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
---
Yeah, N/A on a plan means the plan exists in the ESM but is not available/ obtainable through normal means. Some of those plans got into circulation through Dev Room access and duping. So, if you see any of those N/A plans in the world, they are most likely not legit and Bethesda may remove them from your inventory or ban your account.
---
I hear ya. It's a rare drop
---
They could justify it by it being the vault being opened early to evacuate. It looks like lava or something pouring in one picture and the terminal mentions fire suppression. Maybe magma burned it's way into the vault and it had to be opened early.
---
Well, let's go and hope someone does, and maybe we get a turn around in the next few patches, but as I posted when you got what they did with the F4 and the mods (the one that fixed EVERYTHING and they as far as I know didn't even say TY and o btw someone did our job for us.) I for one am not going to hold my breathe lol. Plus the issue that like its be posted everyone wanted and asked for F5 and not this game and this game could have been made into a PERFECT F5 given time and love... well I am not even going to start down that road lol.
---
not reversed, but less nerfed. they nerfed explosive and two shot WAY too much then needed. no one uses guns anymore
---
My point stands that you need to chill out. It's great you're doing well for yourself, but the way you portray yourself is lacking 
---
Used to be a random chance at the Grafton Rail vendor. Since patch 5 you'll have to find them in the world. Many armor and weapon mod  plans like this that used to be available at vendors (sometimes a random chance) no longer appear.
---
Seems like a fun idea! I might try this.
---
On my way! 
---
Ummmmm..... you hit whitesprings 
---
There's a big and very noticeable difference between Hello games and Bethesda, one is a small company(HG) which needed no man's sky to be successful as it was it's only decent ip. Bethesda is a multi billion £$ company with many ip's to fall back upon.
---
One company couldn't afford it's game to fail because in doing so the company would also fail. The other because it has other games in the works and existing titles which are doing reasonably well can afford one of its games to fail.
---
Putting it short and blunt Bethesda ain't going to pull a "No man's sky" however much I wish they would  
---
I just installed the game today and played for 6 minutes. The game is completely perfect. No meta problems, bugs, or repetitive lifeless content. Can't wait to get Fallout 76 2
---
That would be a great mod. For now, you have to track that manually using my spreadsheet. If there are any mods left that you cannot craft with learn chance other than None left, you still have something to learn from scrapping.
---
Rad scorpion Queen. Appearing under you.
---
&lt;shudder&gt;
---
What's deleted?
---
That seems like a better solution.
---
I find it easiest to just leave ammo/stims etc near the traders. Lowbies always run from me too 😥
---
You're right, maybe I don't have the exact numbers, but I do happen to deal with hundreds of gamers every day at my job, and can make an assumption based on how many people say they are playing the game and enjoying it, its not a crazy big number, but not a small one either. This is one city in North America.  I'm not justifying Bethesda's choices and have no clue if they're profitable or not, just a lot of people seem to think that because social media hates the game it's going to fail in flames and sure, social media, FLAMES!!! But there are a lot of people quietly enjoying it and I would be willing to bet a lot of them have spent money in the atom store. 
---
Exactly. Thank you. 
---
Aw the game is full.
---
Does attacking not end the effect?
---
Rip

Some people are posting that something is deleted. I can't see anything that is deleted. Can someone post a link to whatever it is you see that has been deleted?
---
Did you make this up?
---
You are complaining about toxic gamers yet here you are spewing vitriol because people are playing an rpg and you can't handle it. 
---
I'm just pointing out what I'm considering being the most problematic issues since it's litteraly game breaking. They have so many bugs to fix I would like them to attend to these first, that's all.

Cheers.

Your post, pulled it up and it says [removed]
---
It does for now, but when you lose it naturally everything goes further down.
---
The only way to know for sure is to do the math.  This is a business decision at the end of the day; the investors don’t give a crap about Fallout itself, just the ROI.
---
1) How many units are selling?
---
2) How much income are they getting from the Atom Shop?
---
3) How much will they get for DLC?
---
4) How much will any decision harm future sales of the brand?
---
5) What is the monthly cost to operate and maintain the game?
---
I’d say #1 is level at best and shrinking.  #2 is absolutely critical.  #3 matters only if #1 and #2 indicate it’s worth sinking development costs into.  #4 is the wild card in my mind.
---
If #5 is bigger than the others, the clock starts ticking.
---
Once it doesn’t make money, it’s over.
---
On the original post, there are two links: one to the Excel spreadsheet and one to a Google Sheets auto-conversion of that.
---
&gt; BoS
---
Too bad those plans are MiA since the last update...
---
I just can't understand why they didn't do a proper beta.  I mean, I understand (MONEYMONEYMONEYMONEY), but look at the damage.  How did anyone look at this game in November and say "Ya, this is definitely ready guys, let's release it."
---
Which post was removed?
---
Now shhhh I like this bug and don't want it patched out.
---
Really interesting. I like your theory on the FEV virus. The heart of the swamp event ties into the vault 94 then. So you believe the geck was operating normally and combined with the fev, created the heart. 
---
Yea I guess I seem like a prime target being below level 100 because I travel "alone" a lot, but my team is never far behind me so they usually end up getting rocked.
---
As an alternative to waiting on last laugh, running into a crowd and firing a fat man at your own feet works great.
---
Yea that’s why I said some skins should be rewarded after certain achievements, e.g. killing 100 scorchbeasts or 1000 super mutants. It’s an open world game, not a linear beat-the-boss game, so they should provide incentives for people to keep grinding. 
---
YOU’RE PLAYING A SURVIVAL GAME!!! Jesus fucking Christ. 
---
This post? I still see it as active / not deleted. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Still remember the first time I saw this fucker.  I was doing the quest where I pick up beer bottles at the driving range.  It's dark, and I look over, and that fucker is STARING RIGHT AT ME!   It didn't move or anything.  Just sat and watched.   Creepy little bastard.  
---
Bethesda ALSO said that this game will be great for the traditional fallout fan. So people listened to that and believed them. We were led to believe player interaction would support roleplay, however, that was clearly not the case. Bethesda lied.
---
There are no roleplay tools, there is no rebuilding America, there's no player replacements for NPCs.
---
However, despite some people who were skeptical about this decided to buy the game in hopes that it was able to execute no NPCs well. It doesn't. Not even close. They COULD have made no human  NPC's work well, but they didn't even come close. Just another half-assed lackluster "feature". 
---
Glad I could help! 👍
---
You’re not a good liar. 
---
Also, it opens when you put away your weapon. Pretty cool 
---
Yeah, that should be marked as such in the spreadsheet... At least on the PA Mods tab. I may have forgotten to transfer that info to the main plans tab. I will do that. Thanks for the tip!
---
Maruspial, Bird Bones, Speed Demon and Healing Factor are my top mutations. Grounded is awesome when you dont use energy and scaly skin is also neat. The inflict damage upon melee attacks is also fun. The only bsd ones are the ones screwing with your build. In my case that'd be Empath or Herbivore. 
---
I'm too afraid
---
Yeah, I'm just hopping somebody who mods takes your data and uses it as a foundation for a new mod. 
---
I've server hopped that train station for hours and haven't seen and BoS combat plans. More often times than not there is nothing there. It seems like item respawns have changed somehow, that and I find I end up on the same servers more than before (these two things may be related).
---
Hmm pirate style. I like it
---
I just started last week and I absolutely love it, but obviously I have a few problems, like at level 22 I was pitted against a horde of level 68 super mutants in the event at the winding palace .
---
Just waves and waves of them, it was awesome I gave it my all and won using all my grenades with all my equipment breaking and using almost all my .308 ammo and having to resort to melee, I burned through half my supplies in an epic firefight and lived
---
I loot all the enemies and get almost nothing with a few enemies just disappearing in front of me. 
---
But why was I thrown against level *68*s? If the enemies are just going to give me level 20 loot 
---
I truly love the game though just feel like a few things are off but it is an MMO still too
---
What level should one be in order to participate? 
---
Exactly. Not to mention when you log off you're no longer persistent in the world. How is that supposed to suspend my disbelief.
---
I can't see the marks you left on the world, all I can see is an empty space where your base used to be before it vanished.
---
Immersive btw 
---
The drawbacks with class freak 3 are so minor so your point makes no sense.
---
-1 strenght. Pfff
---
-12 AP who cares
---
I mean you could always just nuke the queen, kill her with the randoms that show up and then walk the nuke zone picking up flora.
---
 They were only in the Train Car west of Watoga Station when I was farming crap.
---
I'm not playing it dude, lol. My comment is ANYONE doing lame shit like that in this, or any game, are usually societal shunned self pitying losers and im not afraid to say what most are thinking but wont type for fear of reactions like these.
---
As a gal who gives fuck all about an arbitrary comment score system based more on cult of personality than objective reality, I stand by what I said. 
---
What are they working on in terms of PVE content? Less frequent scorched beasts attacks?
---
That's an unacceptable amount of effort. 
---
Nope, just like the chameleon mod for armor pieces, you stay invisible.
---
I just see squares with x's and not the emojies but still I totally relate 👍😐😣
---
I had two people run away from me last night while I was trying to get rid of plans and some legendary armor I didn’t want. I’m not gonna chase you around the map like a crazy person please just stop for a sec!
---
I'd say there's no hope. The only thing Bethesda would be interested in at this point is the profitability of the Atom Shop. The game's name is far too tarnished for them to really want to fix is up for any other reason than the Atom Shop. The players/media/everyone says the game sucks so no new consumers are buying it. It's truly unlikely that many people, if anyone, is spending their real world dollars on items within the Atom shop so the game is not profitable enough going forward for them to continue giving a rat's ass. Therefore, I and everyone I played with uninstalled the game yesterday. For us, it's been still too buggy to completely play.
---
Just tried everything it suggests. Still issues 
---
I have not encountered this and now I'm jealous.
---
That's just my opinion.  How anyone else see it is theres. I'm in no way saying it is or isn't worth to anyone other then myself.  
---
I've had better luck than my husband has giving people stuff. I never use power armor though so I think that may be a factor. 
---
I remember when I was low level and dupers always lived in power armor and stacked bobbleheads. They'd do the money emote to trade, but there was that trading glitch too so I never trust it. Not to risk it i avoided anyone in power armor I ever saw for a long time.
---
I think a cool idea for nuke zones would be waves of mobs with maybe a big boss at the end. Bit like Line in the Sand but with a bit more intensity. Would have to be interesting waves as well. So waves of ghouls would be waves of wendigos, waves of scorched would be like 5 or 6 scorchbeasts. Certain areas should have events like this that only pop up when a nuke is dropped on them.
---
I'm sure the servers would never handle it though.
---
Whitesprings and the Scorchbeast queen are the most common, and have the best effect. Whitespring essentially spawns a bunch of legendary glowing ones, and the scorchbeast queen is supposed to be the actual endgame for fallout 76, but is nearly impossible to do alone.
---
From my last comment in another post:
---
I've server hopped that train station for hours and haven't seen BoS combat plans. More often times than not there is nothing there. It seems like item respawns have changed somehow, that and I find I end up on the same servers more than before (these two things may be related).
---
Don't run.  I need to give you all these bullets. Wait.  I didn't mean like that.  
---
Who would I contact now,Microsoft or Bethesda?
---
to my understanding you can launch as many times as you wanr as long as you have key cards that drop from the cargobot thing
---
 you can just look up nukacrypt.com they post the nuke codes for all three sites every reset
---
honestly havent really heard of any good zones to nuke besides white springs and fissure prime.. heard morgantown waa good hut never gave it a shot
---
LMAO
---
“Time to play some Fallout 76 and see what kind of awesome shit awaits me—“ *is murdered* 😂😂👌
---
Yeah cause assholes also wave and do heart emotes right before they destroy your camp. 
---
35 plus at least. I’d guess. I’m 135. Come on anyway I can help can’t help but try 😊
---
Mate if you want to fool around my psn is darkdestory23
---
They aren't trying to save this game. Its an experiment. They moved on. Look at the facts, the ITVs, and the amount of communication about the game. Its dead. It never was alive to start.
---
Meanies. :(
---
I don't understand some of these new players. I put a bunch of plans in the overseer's camp a few days ago. Some guy comes running up in his low 20s and complains he has some of the plans and shoots me with an explosive hunting rifle. It annoyed me enough that I one hit killed him with my sledge. How the hell am I supposed to know what plans he had unlocked?
---
Before you get excited, I'm not the people you played with last night. Also, I don't know half of the game concepts (nukes, those weird blippy code things, and so much more). I'm very casual but I enjoy playing with others and I don't die very much (I feel like that's my greatest accomplishment). My PS4 tag is whatgives22. 
---
Boo-hoo. 
---
I used to grab a workshop just to kill kids for free lol
---
Its not going to happen. Sorry. They don't care for what players want or what they promised, otherwise the game would be better.
---
No I get it. I can do a nuke zone alone in about an hour with my stealth build. Game crash before I get update. Three times   I’d rather make a couple buds and try it quicker
---
&gt;Tbh I make low level alts so I can bait people in to giving me stuff #doingmypart
---
What a hero.
---
 I just made the cut! I think I'm level 39. Let me see if I can figure it out. 
---
Well, that's only true for the camps. How are you gonna please both those who want to keep their camp on next login while still have it persistent?
---
If you want to leave a server-wide persistent base for others to find, go take over a workshop.
---
How do you know they are gone forever?
---
No shit, the game is dead. So they will keep trying to make money.
---
Message em instead of posting in reddit. That'll get their attention better!
---
Yup 
---
Melee non PA means constantly repairing 
---
Cool.  I do hope that it brings in enough money that they continue to support the game, in both fixes and DLC.  They can still right this ship, but man.  It hasn't gone smoothly.
---
 Yes it used to be almost unknown and stuff was there a lot. As it became better known it became harder to find anything there. 
---
 I did it with my plan whore who was in Watoga at level 13 and framed the area constantly for a month. ;)
---
 If you just drop to the menu and immediately hit play you will go back to the one you were on, if they can put you there. Give it a minute.
---
I still do. It’s part of the game. Don’t take workshops if you can’t properly defend them. 
---
And after 2 restarts and a loading screen of infinity I got in. Walked around the corner and froze...... such a cruel joke....
---
I redistribute the loot after it clears the contraband scan, can't let that corruption spread.
---
Or… don’t take workshops if you can’t defend them. Pretty easy. 
---
I dont run melee so I guess that's why I dont need PA. But isn't the current OP melee build using bloodied and unyielding which would mean you can use PA?
---
I understand your frustration and i shall pass this information to the developers
---
Giving an option gives the owner an opportunity to stall.
---
But I sometimes end up in servers I was at 2 or 3 hops ago.
---
I'm constantly trying to hand out duplicate plans, and generally people just run away.
---
I understand why though.
---
Yeah but gulpers 
---
For the first one, yeah, that spreadsheet has a ton more info on plan locations. I'll definitely borrow the information from that spreadsheet and give credit to the original author. For the second one (mod learn chance), that information is already incorporated into the weapon mod and armor mod learn chance and credit was given to the original author. Here's the link to the Reddit post referenced above and in the sheet that contains the link to the weapon mod learn chance: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a62apk/updated_weapon_mod_spreadsheet/
---
Thanks for the info! There always seems to be more work to do!
---
Probably best if this didn't happen. I can imagine the dupers completely wrecking it.
---
When I look at the top of this page it says your main main post is deleted. But when I click on this link it takes me to it.
---
You know there’s a map marker for the ones you call in, right?
---
Yes, rumors say it will come early 2020 
---
Well the newish post, but thank you
---
Why would they care? They already got our money
---
Tin foil hats work!
---
Join up we can figure it out together 
---
Put things in the blue suitcases at train stations. They have unlimited carry capacity so you can put as much stuff in as you want.
---
Yes, patch 5 messed up a bunch of stuff related to plans and locations. The list of plans, mods, weapons, armors, PAs, etc is still accurate. However, some/much of the location info is out of date since patch 5. The BoS material mod plans for Combat Armor are still in the Grafton Rail Vendors list in the data files, but do not actually appear at that vendor since patch 5. Nobody is sure why.
---
Don't nitpick over grammar when you don't know someone's first language. What they said is true in that they (Bethesda) have said nothing of substance. It's all been "in the future" wording with nothing concrete offered. The roadmap should not take months to put together unless it's because they have nothing to put on there. The fact they didn't have a roadmap already available at launch with such little content in the game says a lot.
---
You are literally ignoring what is plain to see outside your blinkers.
---
\*trash bin
---
Because I got blown up by some higher level BOS douche all for me to get tea bagged and my junk looted
---
it is going to the trash bin for sure
---
I usually leave bags of ammo, food, and plans for lower levels when I see them.  Most of the time it works out but I'm only 38 so ita not like I'm some hulking 100+ beadt coming at them.  I also built my camp near the start area so people have a nice spot to craft or break down junk and a stash box.  I was on the pond near the downed vertibird but in remodeling my base I dropped my C.A.M.P. into the water.  So everytime I wanted to do anything I had to risk diseases.  So now I'm looking for a better location.  
---
Seriously. All these people act like they deserve all this. You didn’t call it. I also think it’s hilarious that everyone rips on people playing as Raiders, when in theory, they all are if they go ran-sacking villages and stealing shit. 
---
Someone mentioned that I have forgotten to transfer the plan location info from the PA Mods tab to the main plans list. I'll correct that and post an update. In fact, I have been pointed to a reference that has much more info about plan locations than I have, and I'll merge in that info and post an update. I'll make sure the master plan list locations and the plan locations on the other tabs get in sync. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Apparently Vault 76 was some experiment that weakened all our kidneys and shrank our bladders.
---
Sounds long, tedious, and will probably generate a lot of hate from high level players, but sounds like it would work!  Only one problem, " The Overseer might also hear about a settlement that needs your help, and you have to go to an area where you find humanoid NPCs that really do need your help. "  Settlement that needs your help...  Never want to hear that in Fallout 76...
---
because when the times gone they are gone. it doesn't matter if it comes back a month or year later. it's just a money grabbing system that relies on people going "oh no it's going away I better get it now" that is just a tactic to trick people into buying stuff.
---
How do you know they are not? 
---
Server stability has been an issue since December. It's not going anywhere no matter how many "patches" they throw at us.
---
Do it!
---
Yeah...never made it. I've tried solo with the builds that everyone talks about. I run around so much looking for cards and readers, that next thing I know there are 8 bots stacked up in the hallway
---
Eh, I put a ton of hours into the game, had a lot of fun, but ran out of things that seemed fun to do so I moved on (as did 5/6 of my regular play group).  I think it more than met its 60 dollar value with ease.  I'll be back when they add in more stuff, but I think in general I'm done with it.  
---
How do YOU know what Bethesda is up to? 
---
I wonder if you are the person who gave my friend like 40 plans. He was so stoked (and amazed, he acted like the person gave him a ton of money). He's also the kind not to trust strangers (but we play a lot of GTA where usually if some one approaches you they just want to piss you off). I was wondering to him how to politely refuse (cause I want to find the plans myself, with the exception of pocketed armor, I wanted that so badly I did take that plan off him which was one of the ones given to him). We talk in party chat so I can't just talk to the person and there is no way of messaging.
---
The newish post is this one that we're posting comments/replies on and is not deleted. And the original one (26ish days old) that I posed the link to is also not deleted. Can you post the link to the post you are seeing as deleted? Thanks!
---
I feel like I'm playing with the blind here! Helped defend a work shop. Did the heart, waved, dropped stuff, did the follow, shot the ground a bunch and the person still looks at me and walks away. Do I smell?!?
---
They don't care about what players want.They already got our money
---
I don’t use PA - I’m actually weaker and have less carry capacity with it. The “no PA” armor perks are great, and add in some good legendary deep pocketed armor and you’re good to go!
---
And it’s such a shame so many use it, because everyone just looks the same. :(
---
Nah, I write books for a living, and this story would still be boring even in that format. ;-)
---
These days I don't assume the worst (though I'm still a little nervous) cause so far I just have good experiences with FO76 players. I have luckily yet to meet a griefer (Though I hear people complain about them often enough these days to believe that is changing). 
---
Yea I experienced that today got the random quest marker of go get supply drop. There was a guy there shooting mirelurks so I walked up and picked the lock and got a wanted level.  So I teabagged the crate a bunch to get him to kill me which he did after a few minutes of me jumping around him. And he didn’t even take any of my stuff so thanks guy who was wearing excavator power armor. 
---
Ok, but it‘s a very obvious trick so there shouldn‘t be any victims.
---
I mean, Somerset is just an anti armor .44, that's basically the same thing Gutsy's use anyway.
---
Why would they listen? They got our money, now they just spit on us with every update
---
What isn't bugged? I was able to successfully uninstall it if you wanna get rid of the glitches that way, better hurry before Bethesda fucks *that* up and it bricks your system when you delete it.
---

I'm not seeing that. Anyone else seeing this post (at the top) showing as "Deleted"?
---
I don‘t know and that‘s why I‘m asking ...
---
Shit bro pull up on PS4 if you out here practicing philanthropy in the Appalachian Wasteland 😭! 
---
 I have not seen that. I do it rarely so I'm no expert, but I look at the Store or make coffee or something, then log in again.
---
 I'm only doing that at The Whitespring now for a fucking Jet Pack. ;) 
---
Fuck bethesda. Theyre fucking assholes.
---
Im never buying another bethesda game again.
---
This, especially when I disconnect at a random moment at a location I just cleared while overencumbered just to load back in to getting murdered.
---
They 100% need to turn off the "this intersects" restriction.  Who gives a fuck if my wall is clipping into a rock?  It makes building what you want in some cool a frequent pain the the ass and in some places impossible. 
---
Saw that video on morgantown, but it looked like he had to pull all the ghouls out. For sheer times, it's the queen and whitesprings. Hopefully they add more content to nuke this year.
---
The silos reset is 3 hours if I'm not mistaken. But you can launch from all 3 silos. Me and my buddy do that. Clear out 2 silos in speed runs and launch 2 nukes. Funny too is you can launch one and wait in silo 2. Do a partial nuke on fissure prime and when all people are fighting launch the second one on the whole area to burn up the lowbies. Some people don't even know what's going on and get nuked xD It makes them better players in the long run anyway but ruins the farm for obvious reasons.
---
The queen can be solo'd too. She's not hard with the right loadout. Take an endangerol syringer and if in pa, use heavy weapons with perks. Don't use grenades on her, she'll run away. There's this thing where she flys away especially if she's disabled for a long period of time. I stopped using +50 limb damage just because of this.
---
You see guys throwing grenades all the time, it'll get her flying again and trigger the fly away. Sucks the other day, she flew off right before she was gonna croak. Guys had hit her with grenades and there was a disabler in the group. Before she got too far (and stuck) I shot her down and she turned bright green as she was falling and disappeared in the air. So that code, once triggered is bye bye drops. We still got the quest reward though. She usually flys off the map and stays in the bottom se corner, no one gets nothing.
---
tldr; don't use grenades or +50 limb damage on the queen.
---
Sooo, I run t60 with all rise. Perked up for melee build, but also have enforce x3 for shotty.
---
Last night, it was taking me 5-6 swings for the Gutsy's  and 2-3 for protections.  At one point had 8 bots in the doorway and two of them were assautrons. 
---
I think I take to long running around trying to find stuff. By the time I got to repairing the cores, I had blown thrown 500 rods of shotgun, 14 stimpaks and my all rise was broke.
---
Never made it out of the room with tinker bench.
---
yet if people don't want to buy them now they want to later they can't unless it comes back around again sometime who knows when if it even does.
---
Working as intended
---
Only real issue I have been encountering is the repeating of missions. I've completed the mission "One of us" twice now, but the quest still has me needing to load the system access tape into the sight system terminal.  I have been disconnected maybe three times?  But I never think of much of it because it's an online server, it happens.
---
Maybe I'm just fortunate to not have those problems?
---
Liar
---
My tse handmase does 160, my normal hunting does 163.
---
This might be my problem...
---
That makes its one line per type unless you sub classed the scorthbeast since you have a bunch.
---
As for the AI, class based design means they select an attack to do and have a safety check to make sure they aren't doing that attack too often. 
---
C is done by playtesting. Just like modders have done for years. What's being questioned is the time it takes to make the charge,not the testing. People have volunteered to test if they had a PTS.
---
ECGs fall under life safety systems. A simple code change like changing the graphing scale requires recertification of device.
---
Changing a timer in an ini file is much easier to change than an embedded system like an ECG. If changing an attack timer requires you to redisgn a bunch of stuff your architecture is bad.
---
yikes.
---
Definitely added it to the weights and dumbbells. I’ve noticed that.
---
This is exactly what I do as well.  I just try to pay it forward with all the items I don't need/can't sell or be bothered to sell.
---
As a player who is always seemingly right on the edge of being overencumbered this is a useful way for me to manage my carry weight as well.
---
Yes, but I have seen him beaten and down.
---
That's what I usually do... but that's cause I don't really care to interact much with other people. I am a little worried that they might grief me, but sadly I'm more worried that they'll be too friendly  (as in want to team up and I honestly would rather not. I have a few people I like playing with, and only one of them plays FO76 really. But other than that I'm a pretty antisocial gamer... I mostly play single player and I mostly play FO76 as a single player. Add in my friend believe it or not is even more anti social than me, heh).
---
I'd like to see a more threatening super Mutant Behemoth.  Or a Chinese super robot.    
---
Roaming power armor death claws sounds neat too. 
---
What's your gamer tag ill give u 100caps for it
---
No argument there!
---
Is there a way of messaging people in game?
---
I think thats his point
---
 Wait. Bioshock was a book all along? What a twist!
---
Wut
---
Exactly this, people use the nice people act to bait people for murder.
---
A high level guy ran up to me, dropped a bag and hearted at me. I checked it out to find a single salt and the unloading of an auto shotgun into my face. Full auto slap damage is still a lot of damage.
---
Ended up learning it cuz it didn’t sell for like 2 weeks, sorry man
---
I think dropping them in train stations is a better place to hope people find them honestly.
---
They don’t fight if you have completed Mayor For A Day. 😀
---
Don’t get me wrong I love and respect the jungle! I just can’t stand the damn poachers.
---
I was clearing Abandoned Bog Town this morning and there was one ghoul left somewhere. I went into a shack and turned around and a lvl 154 was right behind me so I instinctively swung my ski sword. He didn’t fire back, just messaged me saying to say ‘say you’re sorry and I won’t kill you’ ( I’m level 114) so the threat didn’t really scare me, but I still don’t see why he tried to intimidate me. When I replied saying he spooked me, he said ah makes sense. And asked if I needed any junk..,
---
Awesome stuff, thank you!

The only person beyond the player that I think it alive is the Overseer. Why do I think that? At the nuke silos she leaves a tape that's rather dull. If you're on the same server when a nuke is launched and visit a silo her tape has changed to vilify you / the survivors from the vault for launching the nukes. That and the whole quest still showing despite no way to progress it I suppose.
---
I thought only ammosmith would increase their yield? 
---
There are NPCs in the game. There are no human NPCs in the game, but NPCs like Rose and the Mayor fulfill the exact same role. That's what makes it even worse 
---
They are also single player where you are 'the guy'. Bioshock wouldn't be nearly as engaging if there were dozens of brainwashed goons following Ryan's orders. You are immersed in the story in a single player by being written into it.
---
Lol. I kinda like scaring people on occasion. Mostly just jump out and run away from them. 
---
But the only time I have gone after people is with decent bounties. Like 30+. Usually the ones with a low bounty accidentally hit somebody's base or something so I feel bad going after those.   
---
I must admit...that confuses me as well.  I used it...once...to make a secret entrance to my garage.  I was VERY upset that the switch on the other side of the door however DOESN'T WORK TO OPEN IT.  Its a 1 way ONLY door.
---
Need to learn how to play fallouts heavier.
---
 I ran out of stuff to do in 3 and 4 after exploring every sq ft of the maps. Still a few spots in 76 need to check after 200 hrs or so. Pretty on target based on previous games.
---
PS4 myself, though I’ve heard the same from XB players.
---
People keep saying there are no NPC's. Everytime I sell junk to a bot, guess what that bot is. An NPC. Rosie is an NPC. There is an NPC in every train station. Whitespring is littered with NPC robots. 
---
I agree the game has a ton of flaws. And we need better communication from the devs. But the lack of human NPCs hasn't bothered me one bit. We even have a supermutant NPC. 
---
I do agree with your other points. Just my 2 cents. Not that it matters because war, war never changes. 
---
Higher INT makes them higher when crafting them. Maxes out at 20 INT I believe
---
Lol! Me, always!
---
I always try to wave at them, to establish myself as a friendly player. Then I’ll wave a bag of money, drop some ammo and stimpaks in a brown paper bag.
---
If they run away, I’ll send a message. (I’m usually in a party so I can’t hear others not in my party running around mic’d up.)
---
I will never understand it. Vice City and GTA 3 were much better than these next gen games. Hard to believe you've got more freedom in a vice city for the ps2 than you do in rdr2 on next gen.
---
Had this yesterday, log off, and then come back, FT didn’t help
---
Ah, I see. Thank you for sharing. It says [Removed] which means a moderator removed it. If it said [Deleted] that would show I deleted it. I'm wondering if a moderator removed it on accident and then restored it, but some servers or clients cashed the removed version. Maybe try clearing your browse cache, or use Shift+Reload or Ctrl+Reload on your browser client and see if that fixes it for you? Can you post your results after that and let us know if it fixed it?
---
Grahm*
---
Lol so true
---
I think after the GECK was damaged it created the hearts, the log there reads it was damaged (hence the big blue spire) and was outputting 7000 rads for a 10km radius. So a malfunctioning GECK could be the cause, though I don't think FEV was included in the mix, I think that only accounts for the Cranberry Bog trees and environment.
---
I see a lot of these posts and wonder why people don't just turn on pacifist mode if they are leveling or unoptimized? I started a few weeks ago, turned it on, and have never had an issue. 
---
Care to elaborate ?
---
There is no "controversy". BGS cares as little for the whiny "Bethesda, waaaaaaah" crap as we do.
---
This post we're commenting on says [removed] but the original post you linked in another comment is working.
---
Haha. I totally spaced that. I've been playing solo from day one and have never played in a group. Solo is a great experience. Feels almost Dark Soulsy theme wise. I've interacted with maybe half a dozen people in my 60+ hours of play. 
---
Yeah. Playing in a group would kind of clash with the whole, everyone is dead vibe. I definitely wouldn't spend the time reading all the terminals and notes and holotapes if I had people waiting on me. 
---
In an effort please everyone it looks luge BGS pleased no one (except me, I got my money's worth)
---
all. day. long. ruins the game
---
This doesnt work???? Cant fint it under audio settings...
---
I like ricochet and bloody mess. The sound of the ricochet going off is very cool and I know that I didn't get hurt by those bullets and bloody mess, well for that gross bloody exploding mess when my victim gets his due! :)
---
75% of the PA I see is Excavator (like mine) the rest is always factions specific, either Enclave or BoS.
---
I think it comes down to the fact that low level players don't want to be mules or get shot for thinking they are going to get shot for teaming up with higher players. 
---
Yeah, my first SBQ kill I was somehow the most DPS. There were only a couple of us all pretty low level so she was scaled pretty low. Anyways, she fell at my feet and it was the only time I got the loot instantly, but I tried to click quickly and then the last item disapapeared because it then went into a load screen. I had to wait until the screen was over to get that same item I already saw.
---
We don't even want to defend it from players. I'm just using it for free building plans.
---
But when a person can start contesting the munitions factory and then fast travel down to you in the Ash Heap to murder you without PvP restrictions, that's dumb.
---
Want a real mmo? /r/ffxiv
---
Remember that when *you're* high level. Best thing you can do for the future of this game is make sure players' first encounters with others is a positive one! 
---
but how the fuck would you get back out? the door closes behind you after you go through...
---
I would really be interested in Beth adding an option where it states somehow NT in our info as in NO Trading or something similar (kind of like a do not call list) so that players don’t waste their time or ours trying to get our attention. We can turn it off &amp; on when we choose. Granted at this point I’m scared to ask Beth to touch the code anymore than they have too.
---
Sugar Grove is where I used to farm springs clipboards have them and Im pretty shur desk fans have screws go to watoga highschool or Morgantown highschool 
---
That's too bad...I almost never encounter people whilst playing and I wouldn't mind just running around with someone a bit
---
You can also learn the other robot helmet plans by scrapping the assaultron head.
---
My Lone Wanderer perk says no.
---
(Xbox) If you send a message through the social menu it goes to your xbox account's messages.
---
I was so confused and happy when I found the two robots talking in the middle of the road and I just couldn’t interact with them.
---
Absolutely, that's what I meant by saying that it's been used 'wrongly' so often, that the 'wrong' usage is now fine.  I expect the new meaning will enter the dictionary in due course as well, unless it dies out.
---
The plans still appear on the vendor's list in the ESM (the game's data file) but they don't appear to ever show up in the vendor's inventory. Nobody knows why.
---
Purple clouds?  What did I miss?
---
I use guns just fine.  
---
Massive? Lolwhat
---
Damnit and I wanted the sweet satisfaction of correcting you
---
How much do you want for it? 
---
I often try to give out plans to low levels so that way that gets them into camp building. Although I don't think I had forty lol so this may have not been me. I usually try to give out at least 2-3 plans to any low level plus 2-4 aid items like food or water or extra ammo I have. 
---
I agree and actually frequently take things I don't need and either bring them to vault 76 when a new person is there, or put them in the overseers box in Flatwoods for someone who needs them (plans, ammo I don't use etc) 
---
Just... Like... That... Lol
---
What facts? Explain
---
The game came out 3 months ago. This is less than an hour a day on average... May I suggest investing in a calculator?
---
Or use your area mic to coordinate where legendaries are and don't be the ass that kills the legendary without allowing everyone to tag it.... Or Bethesda allow everyone to get the legendary loot who is in the event.
---
I have played anti-socially for 90% of my play time but now that i'm starting to run out of things to do, i'll happily mix with others to try and spice the game up from the usual grind.
---
It's surprising how few people actually grief, in my experience at least. 
---
You play on console huh
---
I play very much like this where I don't mind interacting with others but I prefer to wander by myself. Granted if the person needs help and wants it I certainly will help them but I approached several other players as if they play similar to me where they want mostly an offline experience with the occasional friendly wave from a random. 
---
That’s the test? Is that supposed to be hard? 
---
Just joined. I was actually looking for a nuked Whitespring server 👍
---
Sugar grove is good and so is camp McClintock hella clip boards 
---
Just remember their name and find it in the plsyer list.
---
If youre on pc then im unsure
---
Thinking about this series of events has me laughing my ass off.  
---
Def be sure to turn on the ‘tag for search’ feature from your pip boy. Lots of things have screws and springs. Hot plates, coffee makers, and typewriters too! 
---
It also might just be different play styles and what we count as something to do - I love the little Easter eggs like finding the true identity of the sickle man and all the hints that something is more wrong then just the scorch 
---
that said I've hit 300 hours and found most of the things only once I made a new character so many small details I walked past that when I saw them made so many things fall into order from those weird statues to the small pieces of info I walked past that made me go looking for the rest of the clues to the story 
---
but hey thats why I enjoy it no clue why others play 
---
I find that impossible due to repairing.
---
Don't tell me people are somehow making use of the snallygaster attack.
---
I'll explain - so there was a post on here yesterday with a it saying he got a snallygaster spit attack I the loot when he killed one. 
---
Now I'm not saying this is it but sounds similar.
---
The guy said he couldn't use it but that doesn't mean people haven't figured it out yet 
---
Battlefield 4 was actually fixed by DICE with drastic action and had respectable player numbers well into 2018 even when it should’ve been rendered obsolete by Hardline, the Battlefront games and Battlefield 1. New Vegas was patched up by Obsidian and modders, and at least it had an actually great game under the mess, and the same goes for Skyrim, although with way more effort on the part of modders. The whole “Bethesda bugs are charming” meme outstayed it’s welcome for far too long and now players are suffering for it, since it’s been three months and Bethesda has managed to fuck up to the point of MORE FUCKING BUGS making their way into the game and old bugs coming back. The T-Pose ghouls might be funny for like the first five seconds you see them, but then it quickly becomes a case of wishing that Bethesda actually bothered testing their animations. When even GTA 4 from 2008 has more reliable, detailed and smarter enemies you’ve screwed the god damn pooch with depleted uranium shells.
---
Eh, that mod only makes you invis while not moving and crouched though. 
---
I'm sorry you feel this way about people. Hopefully you see the difference between playing a game how you want versus people who actually have social issues. Have a day. 
---
It's more for RP. Not OP fault nothing in the game is hard. Just trying to be creative.
---
Very respectable honestly. Just personally not my play style. Glad you're able to enjoy it though 
---
Last night a saw a fresh level 2 pop out of 76, and since I was carrying a ton of known plans, I thought I’d give them away.  
---
I’m wearing a straight jacket and a gas mask and was running around with a custom made combat knife because lowbie land... kept chasing him and offering to trade and stabbing everything that attacked him as he headed towards deathclaw island...    
---
just running through the woods like that trying to catch him so I could give him my plans.   
---
After about 5 minutes of running away from me he logged off.  
---
Sad day 
---
According to the levelled lists in the ESM, the only place Raider armor plans drop is from the Quest: Signal Strength. And they don't always drop. Since that's not a repeatable main quest, that means each character has one chance to get a Raider armor part plan ever. If you want to farm the plans, you'll have to create new characters and repeat Signal Strength over and over. That's the ultimate grind in this game.
---
it’s the source of the scorched plague it may be hard for some but not all it’s more lore friendly
---
bump!
---
You are a cutie. Have a cookie and try to think before writing. 
---
There is more to do than raging against someone you don’t even know in life.
---
Im sorry but there is nothing constructive in your post or a criticism to any actual point I wrote. So go back try again and when there is more than hate in your post against me, you will get a decent reply.
---
Pro tip: Dont assume that you know people because you read a post on the internet...
---
Im on xbox one and thanks , let me do that , will i be safe in the power armor chasis alone?
---
I said the same thing, and 2hours later some shipdit destroyed my entire base for no reason. (I wasn't even there..)
---
Two-shot does more damage than a full bloodied build. They should buff both 
---
I don't pvp at all.    
---
My main has a lot of stuff that needs to be gone FOR FREE.  I'd rather help others than try to spend weeks maxing out selling stuff just to get rid of it.  
---
Yao Guai and Wendigo drop them.  
---
Also if you're vendor hopping, a couple of the vendors usually have battered clipboards on the counter or near them.  I also check the containers inside each train station - I normally find loose screws or springs once or twice 
---
Challenge accepted.
---
Try getting someone to kill you to remove your bounty!  So much misunderstanding! 😂🤣
---
I never wrote it is impossible to kill them. I only said it’s not worth it. Because wasting 25+ stimpacks and that many bullets is not worth it. 
---
godamnit...
---
There is no "arbitrary" pvp; either pvp or don't. If they removed it, people would complain that they can't hurt each other.
---
Two and three are purely subjective complaints. You don't need NPCs to have a good story, nor do you need to have dialogue options. This is a silly claim.
---
Fourth: there have been updates; there has been communication. Maybe not as much as people want (not as much as I want), but to claim that it is "radio silence" is also silly.
---
A guy waved, then pushed me into a corner and stood there and teabagged me in his powerarmor. I were unable to leave without fast travelling. So yeah, not falling for that again.
---
 I have a friend who play Fallout 4, my Steam game in fact, and he has to pick up the fucking world. He is always panting and I can't watch him for long.
---
 Excavator was made for people like him. I don't operate like that and the X0-1 in my pocket has just slightly less carry than my Combat Armor.
---
I think the one thing to realize is that they are a business and need to make money, so given how hard fo76 tanked it makes almost no sense for them to support it monetarily anymore. To fix the sinking (sunk) ship that is fo76 would require a lot of work, time, and money. And who knows what the return on that will be. This is Bethesda's colossal failure.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Have you tried joining any Facebook groups? There are a ton of them and that's how a lot of people hook up to play.
---
I think you got it. Rads in the fo universe = life. Thanks for the post, really helps you wrap your mind around that area.
---
Lol, nah forget that. I'm just after the mods for chest piece anyways.
---
Thanks for the info anyways, I can stop looking now.
---
Also there are a ton of Discord groups. Try those.
---
Because the suits know we're a bunch of idiots who will buy it anyway. And when the next Elder Scrolls or Fallout etc. comes along we'll buy that too. It does so much damage, and there will be a lot of people who won't pre-order or buy at release future games from them. And at heart I am totally on the developers side. The game is awesome in many ways. I have my criticisms of design choices etc, whoever made them under what circumstances I don't know but at the core the game is excellent and it's really sad that it didn't get the launch and praise it deserves.
---
One of the best mods, Perk Loadout Manager, causes a client crash about 1 in 100 times when accessing the Perk Menu. But the mod is still worth it despite that problem. I run just about every mod on Nexus and all the rest seem stable (i.e. don't appear to cause client crashes). Bethesda doesn't care if you use mods, but if your game has problems and you use mods, don't expect support from them. Since their support isn't that good anyway, using mods really doesn't have any drawbacks, only benefits.
---
Electrically charged animation is broke and just registers as a big purple cloud that blocks your visibility (I think that’s what he means)
---
Water declines about twice as fast as food in my experience. Then movement and chems consume both as well. Maybe fast travel too. Speed demon increases it further.
---
I eat corn soup (10% food, 15% water) and have a point in Dromedary to make to closer to 2:1. Silva Homestead has a ton of corn.
---
I assume Dromedary would affect soup, but rereading the description it just says "all drinks", so I should double-check that next time I play.
---
The giant robot head looks cool
---
I'm thinking they should do a face saving move like, say Todd and his original dev team have moved on to Stafield full time, as it's ramping up. Hand over Fo76 to a new director, who then introduces NPC's back in, and other major changes in a big DLC release. That way Todd can claim "every character is an actual player" during his watch. The new game director just decided to go another direction.
---
Succeed? The game has already failed and has been in numerous bargain bin sales at both retailers and online xbox/psn/PC storefronts. Cut your losses with this game and spend your time on better games or spend it on anything really.  
---
People, just let the game bleed out instead of investing so much time, patience and your good will on it. It will only infuriate you even more when after 6 months these relatively simple features are not implemented yet. We live in a gaming world in which there are a literally thousands of new release every day, there is no need to hold out hope for that a bad garbage game will be improved slighty to become a mediocre garbage game.  
---
You are all literally screeming into the void. It took Bethesda a whopping 1 month to appoint someone to become a mediator for the Reddit that "relays" all of your grievances, bugtesting and suggestions. Any other sane company would cut out the middleman and have the developers directly read the reddit forums and see for themselves what kind of a burning dumpster fire their game is. There is only indirect communication in which you are not even certain whether your voices truly reaches the developers.   
---
In the meantime, the cosmetics/microtransaction store gets updated very frequently.  
---
Vote with your wallets and either refund the game (if applicable) and/or don't buy any Bethesda games again. Your voices are only valid when they hurt Zenimax's financials.
---
Reloading the cache didnt help, and it shows [removed] on all 3 browsers, FF, IE and Chrome. Clicking the subcomment link above doesn't take me to your post either anymore. That link shows [removed] too now.
---
I would have suspected it being diseased
---
How many Fallout games have you played? Human npcs were a big part of the Fallout franchise
---
Place anywhere mod should be built in.   So much more fun could be had.
---
If you're unencumbered that could be the cause. Sell some armor n useless weapons. Drop the weight
---
Give the one chimp that is still actively updating the game a break man!
---
I'm not playing again until the LMG is buffed. 
---
Perks are fixed 
---
And ammo drop rates are increased.
---
Burnt out trying to make  308 ammo only to have it do absolutely nothing 
---
Put it is the toolbox or something else. Overseers stash changes per person 
---
The demo was really rough though.
---
Mine gave me a permanent slow mo  chill effect until i reset the game,
---
I don't see that. Only a handful of people are reporting that problem. Not sure what is going on. I don't see any message from Reddit or moderators about any activity. Seems like some kind of Reddit bug. Do you know how we can contact Reddit or the moderators of this sub to ask about what's going on?
---
Weekly events i think
---
Nope even so I’m level 126 and a level one diseased wouldn’t have the effect of 4 full hp drains, a mirelurk queen yes but not that
---
With my current perks and items, I sit at around 120/250 out of PA, so it shouldn't be the cause.
---
This whole thread needs more clarity.
---
When I started I would always run away. I didn't understand the damage mechanic- I always thought I was about to be 1 shot when I wasn't looking by a high level. The fact that you have to "accept" the fight for it to really hurt you is great. 
---
Occasionally I still have the random guy 100 levels above me that's willing to chase me halfway across the map even though I'm clearly not fighting back. High level guys must really get bored lmao
---
Want a real mmo? [https://www.reddit.com/r/swg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/swg/)
---
I wish there was some kind of anti-pop zone for crafting and trade where we could help new guys out. If you want to keep the narrative, you could have a "lock down" area of white springs with invincible robots who trigger a conversation prompt for violators: pay a lot caps or get murdered and lose caps...or something like that
---
And where is the news in your post?
---
Hey I'm only lvl 37 and ill take all the gifts you want to give me! Got any ballistic fiber or plans?
---
Are you me? That happened twice last night. The other one that gets me is when they finally figure it out, take everything, and then run off without a word or an emote. You’re welcome?
---
Well yesterday I decided to start again on my xbox and had an invisible killer hunt me down and it wasnt a player cause I was lvl 2
---
I'll do it. 
---
No it didn't
---
Found a Mrs. Nanny going up along a hill, South of the Mothman town with 3 black cats following behind it.
---
I'll buy any duplicates you get for caps. They'll be worth slot. :) Good luck!
---
LMAO. At this point I don't even need an emote back. Just please. Take my offerings. 
---
I also did, mine was for some kind of revolver but I can't remember which one
---
I’m sorry man but that *is* pretty funny
---
I do.  On many days it takes like 20 minutes to do the dailies at best.  
---
I stopped using guns when my Super sledge does alot more damage .
---
My LMG does 16 with perks takes 2-3 reloads for a high level Super mutant.
---
Supersledge can 2-3 hit.... 
---
Not worth the materials to use guns.
---
just go kill it and add me or meat cleaver on ps4
---
Someone ran from me while I was wearing my straight jacket and a gas mask and just holding a knife last night... I was trying to give them some really cool plans. 
---
I feel your pain 
---
You can only polish a turd so much. In the end its still fallout 76
---
I think there's some Reddit bug, or strange moderator activity happening. I'll find a way to contact Reddit amd the moderators on this sub to find out what's going on. Thanks for the feedback. 
---
im sorry to break it to you but there will be no happy end for this game.
---
They didn’t fix the bugs, they prolonged the grind considerably and they even added a pvp mode instead which no one ever wanted.
---
So no more pve will be created. 
---
Legendary weapons are not unique weapons and shouldn't be fixed reward items. IMO they need more unique weapons and items in the game, but the thing about them is they're not as powerful (and they're not supposed to be)as some of the rarest legendary combos so they tend to be disused as soon as a person lucks into a really good legendary. Legendary items aren't supposed to be their own quest though. Farming for legendaries isn't supposed to be a thing. It's only become a thing because the game needs a content update and hasn't got one yet.
---
If you did want to fix the legendary drop system... the best thing to do IMO would be to reduce the legendary spawn rate by about 90%. Then make the legendary drops go from 3-5 star and get rid of 1 and 2 star entirely. Make legendary items rarer but satisfying.
---
Im on PS4 and my camp is near the overseers.  I am only a level 40 as of today, but I put anything I can into the overseers box there and in Flatwoods.  Low level guns, ammo, melee, purified and boiled water, soups, teas, juices.  I try and give things away too.  
---
Some people are jerks, but I will say I have met nicer more helpful people on PS4, than my son has on Xbox1.  
---
Sorry some people are assholes.  
---
In game go to the map, hit z \[PC\] for settings, under game select pacifist. That way if you accidentally hit someone or their base you won't get flagged for pvp. Workshops is another thing, you want pacifist off. If you become wanted, you want that off so you can kill bounty/bag hunters. Have a buddy kill you to take the wanted tag off. Better the bounty go to him (and he might not take your bag =\])
---
That is subjective. The “Bethesda lied rhetoric is getting old, especially when it applies to something based entirely on opinion. As a consumer, taking the dive on a game even though you are skeptical is your own fault. I understand any gripes about the game, and it should have had at least 6 more months of development, but come on.
---
Yea it’s nice to see good loot drops, and with an aa double barrel it doesn’t take much to kill em
---
I don't give a shit about the rarity of shop items.  How about making them affordable?  If things cost $1-$5, I'd be more inclined to spend some dough.  As it stands, I'm more inclined to give them a giant middle finger, and never give them another cent of my hard earned dough.   Fuck them.   It's outrageous.  
---
My main character is level 56..never used PA..don't see myself using it in the near-future either
---
I just wave at them &amp; invite to team.
---
I people these days.  I also like to party with them fast travel to them drop a bag as fast as i can then fast travel away.  Hopefull when im doing it right people are like did i just see that lol
---
Every one of them, except bos
---
Haven't totally cut my cord yet. I'm more on hold and see what future changes bring. if they, say, bring back real npc's, I'll jump right back in.
---
I'll take that as a challenge 👹
---
I love how few people grief. Coming from playing GTA online, it's so fucking awesome. I almost love the game just for the fact it seems most people are friendly or at worst just ignore you.
---
You're in serious denial if you don't think the future of this game is in jeopardy. It's not just this sub, this game is getting shit on at every turn. The only headlines on it are negative. Unless they tighten up, this game won't be able to survive, as much as I, you and many others want it to. I'm genuinely confused by the sunset of players that close their eyes and plug their ears as if nothing is going on. This game is in trouble, mate. 
---
Easy. Move on to another game. It won’t be fixed. Bethesda made that very clear. 
---
I've joined my friends games. Just to be in a world that i can easily join back if i gotta go poop or something. Lol
---
Thanks!  I'm level 50, is there a place they spawn that won't insta-kill me?
---
Or did they start populating the map and say "This is really unstable guys, what do we do?"   
---
I don't mind helping people as I come across them but I also don't want to continue on with them once we've overcome what ever obstacle I was helping them with. I kinda like heliping people, I just don't want to be tied in with any one person.
---
We need to encourage people to get microphones.  That should help. 
---
Or lock pick the only purified water container of the 5 you have.  Just to lie, say they did t know how they became wanted and had my turret start to target them.  Then to add insult, did some launch thing that brought “the rain” and destroyed my cabin, crops, and purifiers.  Made me sad,  I’m 38y/o and I’m like wtf dude, if you needed something ask, no need to destroy my stuff!
---
Surprisingly I just got it from scrapping a circuit board
---
Well, yes, I also got tired to wait for them to make more worthy PA skins, so I released a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/233?tab=description) to help other people to deal with it at least client-side for now.
---
This...
---
Yes they broke it when they tried to fix the disease in the last patch.
---
When I have more than 1 technical data if I log in it's as if I get hit by it and then it appears at my feet. It's like the game trying to force you to only have 1.
---
I wouldn't recommend it. I'm only playing it because i hate not playing a game that i invested in. 
---
I suggest playing fortnite lol
---
Thanks, I would not have thought of that; I will take a look. Fb is not my goto because I feel like it’s the Walmart of social media haha
---
So many boarded up houses
---
not rlly a challenge just to make sure you actually joined the bos
---
Would be nice if it wasn't one that got closed such a long time ago, that someone born after it shut down would be able to read your post. 
---
Yeah I got to kill mine. I don’t remember if he dropped any good loot... so probably not haha
---
Don’t you have to get an “invite” like tho? I can give it a google. Thank you
---
Subbed! Helpful, thanks! 
---
Had a very nice chap come up to my friend and I this morning with free plans. Thank you muchly kind sir.
---
Yeah. Other guy said he was planning on doing SBQ. He changed his mind. Apologies 
---
Lol actually he’s right. You said there were no npc’s, that is the same as saying the npc count is zero. And as he stated anything multiplied by zero is still zero.
---
You might want to work on your wording because you are failing to get across what’s actually in your head, what you meant to actually say.
---
There are NPC’s, just no human NPCs, that’s critical flaw number one in your post.
---
They have communicated with us many many times, from the newsletter, to the patch notes, to the forums. You stated as if they have been completely silent, just because what they have said did not suffice to you, still doesn’t mean they didn’t say anything lol. Critical flaw number 2.
---
With two critical flaws in your post do you think anyone will actually take you seriously? I mean it’s clear your reality is strongly influenced by your opinion.
---
If you want to get a point across, learn to call out things for what they really are, not just for what you think they are.
---
Yeah it is purplish. I'm not sure that what he's talking about. You can already stealth with mark iii and radiation/crits for armor bypass. Be funny if they got the robot engineers smoke for players to work.
---
Depending on the settings yes and no.
---
I still haven’t seen any honey beasts in the wild, only time I’ve seen them is from the honey picking event...
---
Rather, in a nuke zone have a unique event, like a cavern opens like lose bearing, and we fight in an ant nest, a gigantic deathclaw, huge swarm of rad scorpions. Endgame is boring to me. 
---
How about radiation emitter trap 
---
I agree. Went back to FO4 until the Division 2 comes out. Sad though, I’ve enjoyed Fallout for over a couple decades now...
---
There is a somewhat hidden room in the bigger building in the middle of bog town. You can access it by dropping from above in the elevator shaft. Plenty of typewriters, clipboards, pens, and globes.
---
i went to Overseers Camp, dropped  a power armor chassis and a bag of stuff i don't want/need/ununsable then sent a message to the level 5 player closest to me. he said thanks and asked why so generous.  
---
told him i rather give than to let the bag rot away.  
---
can we put a timer on bag please? i know this is not Ark but, after you or a creature dies, there's a timer showing when it'll disappear. if you or a creature dies, it disappears in like an hour.  
---
but, the ones you drop from you inventory has a 2 minute countdown.
---
This is why I like this game 
---
I appreciate that! I will try the groups first since I kinda do want to participate in the PVP piece of the game, I just don’t stand a chance alone. 
---
I wonder if that happens with bulked plastic and the getting lucky with the super duper perk. 
---
I thought people already glitched into all the vaults and they were all empty. Which likely means they have some what recently added content this in the last month or so... a shame they won't let us know. 
---
That may be true for base FCs, but ultracite FCs are ammo and ammosmith increases their base charge.
---
You have to scrap syringers for the chance to get different barrels. The different barrels change the effects
---
Are you using weight reduction perks? It might be that the 1500 limit is counted before any weight reduction gets applied.
---
They are mods on the weapon it self. 
---
I know I'm late, I don't know if it's still relevant, but here's one of my clips with high intelligence (and strength).
---
I guess if this discussion comes up again you can show them this.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFQNd\_ICRis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFQNd_ICRis)
---
I usually use the trade emote and drop the bag and tell  them its free via mic.. Low level players can't use my weapons but if they level up quick its a nice thing later
---
You get that they don’t care, right?  They don’t give a crap what you want or don’t want.
---
I like the game, so I'm obviously a bit biased here, but if you liked Fallout 4 and think it would be fun with some online elements, well, you'll probably like FO76. I like the kind of surreal feel to the game - it feels more "alive" in some regards, with the vibrant flora and creatures, but also desolate and empty because all of the people are dead. I consider it like a B- version of a Fallout game - not as good as 3, New Vegas or 4, but I just still really like the setting and game mechanics. 
---
However, if you're looking for an intense shooter, or a really competitive PvP or PvE game, then FO76 isn't really that game. I'm pretty close to a filthy casual gamer at this point, and I haven't found the combat or the survival aspects tough to manage. It is basically a souped-up version of the mechanics from New Vegas. (Never tried that mode in FO4.) I've done almost all of the prominent quests in the game, and I've died 3 times - twice in combat, once from falling off a cliff. 
---
Yeah, it’s totally inconceivable that other people could have a different experience than you. If it isn’t something you personally have seen, it cannot possibly be true. Only your account has any truth value. 
---
Everyone else that deviates from your personal account is lying or exaggerating.
---
Same here, happening everytime i do it.  Must be a bug.
---
Naaaaah 
---
Haven't played GTA in 4 years easily so no idea what that's like but i can certainly imagine.
---
I was more worried about f76 griefers at lower levels. I'm at a point where i've played enough to know how to handle myself and even enjoy it when people try to grief me directly.
---
 Yes!
---
Much like in Fallout 4.
---
My main character is lvl 240 and I can’t go anywhere with players and not have 3 nubs rushing up to me spamming trade.
---
The only difference between me and you is if someone gets outta line I just kill them.
---
That's good to know. Didn't know that either.
---
What system is your community involved in?
---
And if you're doing the daily vendor loop - There are often some phones and other junk worth scrapping in the Whitesprings bunker, and the Brotherhood of Steel vendor usually has some clipboards and other junk near him. The agricultural center also has a couple boxes of loose screws, and the second floor offices are often overlooked by the newer players doing Fertile Soil - some clipboards, phones and other items up there. 
---
I use ammo weight perks and traveling pharmacy 
---
He also attacked my camp :/
---
It's about DPS, not damage per attack. Your handmade is way better for DPS.
---
I ate Mentation (wasn't paying attention to what kind) while in my power suite, and the effect started happening to my teammate beside me who wasnt in power armor - but not to me.
---
Sadly people get ripped off. I fell victim to my own stupidity yesterday and lost my best weapon trying to trade with some at a much higher level. 
---
Do the latter. Uninstall check this sub now and then and come back IF and that is a big IF Bethesda started to really work on fixing the game and more content.
---
Thanks! So I guess there's zero value for unyielding when I'm already at
---
20+ natural int. 
---
I'm know I'm late to the thread here and this may not be relevant anymore, but here's a clip I got from november with extremely high intelligence.
---
 You can buy them from some vendors. The Whitespring springs to mind. ;)
---
Completely disagree, I farm flux to sell extras to vendors... easy money. 
---
We are doing that right now 
---
Really? Let me try it... 
---
How odd. I kept dying upon logging in at the whitespring train station.. A few days ago. Didn't make sense since the area wasnt nuked or anything.
---
I don't know what your circumstances are so hard to say about your survivability.
---
You can reliably find them near watoga station as you head out to NAR. They're at the edge of the Watoga city area as you walk along in the field. If you have power armour, you should stand a good chance against them.
---
Played 3 hours today. 4 disconnects. Shit's unbelievable.
---
I bought it at $40 (Xbox) and don't regret it one bit. I have gotten about 150 hours in before the boredom began to set in (running out of things to do). I also don't know if it will drop much below $35 or so for Xbox One/ PS4 any time soon for a digital copy. Hopefully expansions come and the game improves over time, but even if nothing else comes out of 76, I am very glad I bought it.
---
Good for you ... I lose marsupial every time rad worms goes away.
---
I gave up on remote play and bought 76 for Xbox one .. the streaming to laptop is flawless and can use an actual controller.
---
Cannot roll my eyes hard enough at you drama queens.
---
Wv must be part of the matrix, I was in a nuke zone there once and literally was getting 0 rad damage 
---
thanks maybe that's the x factor
---
I've been on the end of both good and bad experiences with high level people. Twice I've been murdered in a train station while selling my wares. My teammate and I have both been murdered multiple times while running through the wasteland. I've let people use my base and then they start shooting it up. On the other hand my teammate and I were given a bunch of plans and other goods after a high level helped us beat an event and a few times we've emoted to high level people for help and they saved our skins from various life threatening altercations.
---
Not the servers, since everyone else is playing, try reinstalling. Most likely your update got corrupted.
---
Play RDR2 
---
amazing
---
Cool opinion, bro.
---
P.S No one asked for your wannabe Dr. Phil advice
---
Fusion reactor?
---
r/thathappened
---
The sad part is I was ready to spend money on atoms but everything they have put up is pretty much garbage.
---
It might either be a bug or nerf. I'd go off what the pipboy says.
---
Whatever exploit that is, I doubt it's in game anymore.
---
Bethesda promised a lot more opportunity for player interaction than emotes and murder. The trading system is trash and their are no player vending machines. There's no trading hub, no economy to speak of. That's not what was on the label 
---
dam 15yrs already? i felt like 3, Vegas, and 4 had a lot more to do specially with the dlc
---
When I roll a low level I *hate* when higher levels come by.
---
NO, I don't want your shit.
---
NO, I don't want every mob in the area to be vastly too powerful for me.
---
But then I'd enjoy this more as a single player game for the most part.  I like to listen to the holotapes, I hate being on comms unless it is a fight, etc.
---
That is what I just said
---
The Division 2, pre-order now!
---
New dawn will be a great option, it has drop-in 2 player co op support (if you want to story mode with a pal). 
---
Unfortunately FO76 just feels like a choir. 
---
Graphical wise it's eh, it's 2019, they missed the standard. There is no real main quest, from the start you have no real objective. The side quests are frustrating as a 10 minute quest will take you over an hour. 
---
The enemies are bullet sponges.
---
The map is big but empty, there are no vehicles to get around quicker and all almost all fast travel options cost to use.
---
Then there's the survival mechanics which are fine but without anything else in the game you kinda just want your character to die..
---
This is coming from someone who LOVES Fallout.
---
Yeah I thought I noticed a big hit to crit perks too. I was getting crits every shot 90% of the time and now it's consistently every other shot at best. It makes a big difference because I can't clear mobs like I could before. I had to get rid of my weight reduction perks and invest in weapon damage perks so I could deal with mobs again, and being overencumbered is even worse for a crit build than it was before.
---
I bought it for £25 a few months back. I’ve racked up maybe 100 hours on it since, and I’m just kinda getting to the point where I’m running out of stuff I consider fun.
---
So for 25P/hour for enjoyable gaming time, I’d say this game is good value for money, but prepare yourself for a bug fest
---
So you claim any legendary weapon should automatically do more damage than any non-legendary?  You’re dense.
---
That first statement alone sums up why I log on.
---
It's great fun but it feels a little hollow doing pretty much giving and getting that moment of joy.
---
Opened early but then where are the people or bodies out in the world we have already explored or evidence of them.
---
Each silo is on a cool down between launch (3 hours IIRC). You can buy a holo tape from the armory in the enclave bunker that will tell which are available. That is all.
---
I found the bos soldier uniform last night in the Train car. Already know the plan, but I think there is hope. Try joining friends that are in game and not on your server
---
1000 caps
---
They aren't constantly updating the Atom Shop, these items have always been in game they're just on release schedule.
---
Atom shop doesn't take anything away from the updates.
---
I had a random lvl. 10 team up with me this morning. He sounded really young, maybe 10 - 13. I'm only a lvl. 59 myself, but it was actually kind of fun just tagging along with him and giving him a hand here and there. I took him up to the crashed space station and Watoga so he could have it as a fast travel spot and maybe level up quicker.
---
The earlier limited time sales item have so far shown up a few weeks later as permanents.
---
 I stopped reading at "many streamers believe".WTF dude?
---
I'm not necessarily a low level, but whenever I see another player, I always just give a wave emote.  Only time I really attack people is if I have a bounty, so I'll shoot them a couple times in hopes they'll kill me and take it, but give a message saying thanks for killing me after.
---
Doesn't it feel wrong that there's so few that we have to count the vendor bots?
---
Since the story is that all the above-ground humans became scorched, they could still introduce humans in DLC's via the vaults or [other underground structures](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rockopolis), or from outside West Virginia without contradicting the story line.
---
Even more quest robots would be great. It's so unrealistic that people recorded all these instructions, and programmed all these terminals with almost-telepathic sensors to instruct others to continue their work after their own demise. Nobody has that much foresight, and with all that effort they could have done it themselves.
---
It can mute your mutations completely when you cure it or it cures itself. Re-logging fixes that, but that can be a pain.
---
http://incendar.com/Fallout76_Junk.php
---
Wait another 3 months, it might be for sale at your local GameStop for 15 dollars
---
That sounds more like how many swings it takes for off-spec melee. Can I check what perks you're actually running?
---
I totally had this happen to me and I apologize. I had just started the game and was approached by a higher level. I freaked out, especially because the ”follow me” emote looked like ”bring it” to me. So I took off. Once I realized what they were trying to say I looked for them but I had no idea where they went. 
---
Buzzz... 🐝
---
It's never too late since you don't really get punished for spending those points. When you get up to level 50 you _probably_ won't want to use one handers. Those 3 points are easy to make up.
---
If you encounter me all you have to do is ask lol. I've never killed anyone in the game who hasn't asked.  
---
Ah, I am not a fan of pvp in general. ONly time I willingly did it/look for it in GTA was when I was extremely bored. And then I'd usually remember why i hated it (to be fair, cause I suck. There is only so many times you can keep dieing before it gets boring and not worth bothering trying again).
---
You know you can use your laptop to stream your ps4, while using an actual controller as well? 
---
https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/index.html
---
I've used remote play on my laptop with a dualshock 4and it works flawlessly. I just enjoy having the entire ps4 in my hands hence using the vita as well for remote play.
---
From my experience it doesn't matter if you scrap legs or arms. You can learn all the learnable mods from scrapping arms (cheapest). At first I didn't believed it myself, but then I learned sleeks and muffled from scrapping arms.
---
[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anvt9t/bos_combat_armor_plans/efwdm8w) is on the same topic and one guy verified the bos helmet theory
---
This game desperately needs some of the features from Place Everywhere. If nothing else an option to disable automatic piece snapping for the fences would work wonders.
---
The weight limit is computed after weight reduction perks. It is most likely that you are using the SaveMyStuff mod. It prevents you from selling. If you have that mod remove it from your .ini and let us know if that works.
---
LOl I watch them on the map and waypoint ahead of them over and over pointing at cigarette machines I dropped loot in. 
---
If they didn't do the enclave questline they can't go down the elevator fyi. 
---
Shit i play the game since the reclamation day and still didn't know this kind of things 
---
It is most likely that you are using the SaveMyStuff mod. It prevents you from selling. If you have that mod remove it from your .ini and let us know if that works.
---
Wasn't that a bug with a specific mod? Not sure which, but if you're on PC then disable them all and try again.
---
Well it's currently not open obviously. When its released would be the evacuation. Have something to wrong in the vault and they have to open early. That would either allow NPCs to be added or a new type of enemy.
---
I can't find your psn id
---
If they had something like , you know, something revolutionary like a chat client, that might be something. 
---
The open weekend worked great for me.
---
Didnt stop them from putting super mutants and the BOS into the game. If they wanted to do it they could come up with a retcon.
---
"they are making small my new changes".
---
Lol. minute. 
---
You did indeed. Can't english good sorry.
---
I just pop a couple of rad aways when needed. 
---
Go far enough NW and you'll find a farm that grows Cranberries. Can be used in cranberry recipes which gives +5% or +10% xp. I assume this stacks with the sleep xp bonus.
---
Anyone can say "not all players" on literally any aspect of the series, but fallout games were routinely praised for their NPC interactions, so it's not much of a leap to assume that lots of the players appreciate that
---
My brother and I share accounts so I cannot stream to laptop due to the 2 account limitation Sony set.
---
When I was level 21-22 at whitesprings, had a 2 full set of t60 lvl50 armor in my stash, gave one to a lvl 49 player and he gave me a full Excavator armor set in perfect condition. Skipped making my own and got a “free” set of armor I didn’t have 🙃
---
Name a game as flawed as 76 that was released to the public? Eve Online: Trinity. Remember the joy when people found out it'd delete their boot.ini file? Anarchy Online shipped with invalid CD keys, and sometimes double-billed people. That's not counting server crashes/downtime and bugs that left areas inaccessible. I'd easily say both of those are worse than 76. And how about that BF4 sniper silencer that silenced the entire server? That's not counting the rubber banding, bullets not hitting where you aimed, server disconnects, and random crashes/freezes. Remember when FF14 was so bad they pulled the game and relaunched it the next year? There's a long list of shitty, broken MMO releases. Fallout 76 is just the latest.
---
I never run from high levels. Within 15 minutes of leaving the vault, I had a high level benefactor giving me weapons and plans. I LOVE high level players.
---
As much as the game is lacking, the community it has created is one of the most helpful and generous ones I've ever come across. 
---
Know what I love? 
---
When people rush to the end of a game they know has no endgame and then complain that there's nothing to do, I'm over 100 hours into the game and still not max level because before I even started playing I researched and found out there is NO endgame, so I'm taking my sweet ass loooooooooong time, reading everything, doing everything, building everything, I'm loving it.
---
Now I’m even more amused that I thought it was just two robots on an awkward date.
---
Happened to me a few times too, no clue why. Same, bird bones is still working and it is not Rad-X
---
May I suggest you learn to work without one?
---
Why cazadores? Bees are fine
---
You’re seeing a lot of the same comments because you’re one fool that has too much time compared to everyone else.
---
i am able to trade on my laptop which does not have any mods. But my desktop does have the save my stuff mod
---
Well we dont wanna die so we sorta have to prepare for the worst just in case lmao
---
Radworms thing maybe..? With this game could be anything...
---
I wouldn't recommend it as a solo game, although the quest lines work better that way and exploration can be immersive. With a teammate it feels less deserted and you have someone to share loot and server crashes with.
---
I'm talking about BoS *combat armor* plan, not soldiers uniform. I've seen those too. No combat armor though.
---
I never said that I said the beta was trash because of all the bugs now the game is meh but I never pursued in buying the game after the beta and I'm probably older than you 
---
yup, exactly the same here :/
---
Oh shoot. I hope I haven't actually been taking somebodies stuff.
---
Anything that burrows is kind of a crapshoot.  You see it with Workshop events involving burrowers like Mole-Rats too.  They just don't spawn.  Do these at your own peril. 😒
---
I did that a few times it seems like if you have 10+ it may not list them all and they may not seem like they're working but the game still thinks you have them.  I farmed what i could then drank serums for the good mutations. 
---
This is the dumbest comment on my post yet. you don't have an option of whether or not the PVP. People can follow you around and attack you continuously and take down your health. They can come to your home and destroy it with explosives. They can disrupt your gameplay and force you into PVP. Hell, there are even bugs where if you have reactive plates on your power armor, you instantly become wanted if someone else attacks you! 
---
additionally, every single other Fallout has had NPCs with dialogue. That is the standard they set forth. The best of them, New Vegas, had the most immersive an amazing story ever with NPCs. this one has no NPCs that actually have any dialogue, thus making it lame and boring. Sure, it is my opinion, and is subjective, but it is one hell of a common and popular opinion. Feel free to get salty all you want over my opinion, but many agree with it and it is killing the game. 
---
Additionally, then posting updates that they are working on one or two minor fixes for the game tells us nothing. That takes like 10 minutes of effort.
---
Guess I am gonna have to start carrying around orbital strikes now then lol. Maybe pull the fatman out of storage. 
---
I'm still level 14 and at first I avoided other players like the plague.. . But a few good experiences now however and I'm running to everyone waving like an idiot to see if they want be friends 😂 most people I've come across are very generous. I'm 30yrold but this is my first real online gaming experience.
---
I tried to return the favour when I was on map and saw a level 2 coming out th vault. I fast travelled and tried to give him a stimpak and ammo but he ran away. I might start using the mic more...
---
I'm just saying I found a bos plans there. Found the arm mod I was looking for a couple of days ago.  Lucky drop I guess
---
...to be honest, I played a ton the first two weeks and haven't touched it since. No clue if the build still works; I've heard that the game is pretty different now. 
---
I think you upgrade the sword and gun at the Workbench. 
---
Also, although the build is really fun, it's probably better to go for something more balanced - sword build 100%, but not the low-health sword build. xD
---
What's the point of knowing how to do the glitch?
---
what do you mean?
---
not shielded raider underarmor or even protective. I finally got protective raider from uranium fever event a few hours ago. this is also how u get shielded once u have learned protective but obviously its a rare drop
---
I noticed the other day that when I equipped Stranger In Numbers, my mutations stopped working. Unequipped it, and they were fine again. So between that and the Radworms thing, there is def something screwy going on with mutations at the moment. :(
---
I really don’t understand this. 
---
First of all, if you, your friend, anyone’s regular armor has good defenses and mitigation, then you won’t be repairing it very often.
---
How much condition your armor loses is based on how much damage it is taking, if your defense is low, it takes a lot of damage, thus it loses a lot of durability.
---
I don’t even run white knight and I repair my armor every maybe 10-15 hours of game play. So basically every few days if even that.
---
Yesterday I gave 60 ballistic fiber to my friend because having 160 in the stash even after selling a fair amount to vendors, was pointless.
---
If you’re gonna complain about something for regular armor, how about the fact that it takes 30k radiation resistance to get the same radiation negation as you receive in power armor?
---
Yeah, they drop prime plans sometimes, maybe one out of five. Also had an Ultracite Explosive Vents plan from one, although it's possible someone else dumped it there.
---
I’ve got so many heads and scrapped them, how do you get the assaultron circuit board to helmet? Is it not from the head itself?
---
At least he didn’t call in an orbital strike destroying half of your base and immediately logged out before you could hunt him down for bounty. 
---
What adds salt to the injury? YOU are the one who have to pay for the repairs not the one who did this to you. This happened to me not once not twice but three times. 
---
How hard it is to make a passive mode so nobody can harm you and your base? Imagine someone walk in to your house, set it on fire and walk away with no punishment. 
---
I much rather pay caps to insure my base so I don’t have to spend an hour to collect 15 different materials just to fix it.
---
Well, what if people just take them for the events and subsequent defend events, but not for the PvP? I always take them for the events if they are unowned, but I never defend them from players because I don't really care to hold them. It still puts you in PvP even if you don't go back to defend it. 
---
&gt; Bonus tip: you can see the field of vision of all (I think?) search lights if you use Berry Mentats. It can help with placing them. 
---
Good tip! Thanks!
---
&gt; Mine sometimes still don't aggro until I engage the thing shooting them, though.... 
---
And sometimes not even then — five feet away from me meleeing the damn thing right in front of a searchlight and a pair of turrets (rocket &amp; heavy laser). I can't recall that ever happening in many hundreds of hours of Fallout 4 play that included raids on my settlements with turrets.
---
I'm running 9/9 rifle perks, 3/3 tank killer and 3/3 concentrated fire. I've been wondering if i should change to 1/3 concentrated fire and go 2/3 into Long Shot. Thoughts?
---
Defo hoping they revert back on the sneak nerf. Still easy to waltz through say west-tek on a legendary farm but has definitely made life much more hard work. Certainly has made my Adrenal build more exciting!
---
I had a group of 4 players that all teamed up on me the other night, lowest lvl guy was 62 the others 100+. I'm lvl 32 can kinda hold my own in a fight but not to this fucking onslaught. Long story short I came across a locked supply drop, picked it (not knowing that I'd become wanted) then traveled back to my camp to dump my junk just in case the enevidable happened. Then got murdered by 4 cap thirsty dicks!!! It was a 10 cap bounty. Like you that hard up for caps jeez. Then insult to injury they leveled my camp. 😑😑😑
---
The most common explanation is Radworms, a disease which is all screwed up after Patch 5 and has some odd effects, like making you jump so high in Marsupial that you "land" in mid-air, and disabling Marsupial for the rest of your session when it is cured.
---
Unfortunately, it's hard to avoid and, for whatever reason, ridiculously common now.
---
The other single panel non keypadded door that comes with the recipe. The keypad is the in, the non keypad is the out. 
---
I'm on x box and it seems like when I'm in a team it always happens
---
So would I. So would you. They're high-value targets that take relatively more materials to build. Same with decontamination showers.
---
You can send a PlayStation screenshot to a random friend and then use the PS messages app and download it directly. But really it's the same amount of steps
---
Just but a preowned from gamestop. You have 7 days to see if you like it. 
---
Where is this built at? This is the exact type of location I am looking for
---
Yeah most mobs HATE Blackberries. I have blackberries all over the place lol
---
We need some kind of code, like" wave, heart, wave, thumbs up", that way people know whether or not your friendly.
---
um, okay, but the person I was replying to did...  why'd you chime in then?
---
This soooooo old. This was a glitch they fixed than brought back when they used an outdated version of the game to patch other bugs. And what lazy fucking reporters work at polygon and kotaku. THIS IS NOT NEWS. You are not doing shit but linking to reddit threads. And this guy just doesn't know hes late to the party. I've sent videos to Bethesda, detailed glitches and exploits, hell I emailed about the dev room. I have yet to even get a reply. Currently my camp is under the map in a boat floating in middle of no where with no build limit. Bethesda does not give a flying fuck about fo76, and Polygon you bastards are just fucking ridiculous.
---
I'll say this till I'm blue in the face, but the server is not the problem, its the client.   
---
The servers actually do very little outside of syncing which it does well enough and looking with wire shark we can see there is never a drop in connection from it. What does fail is our game sending it to the server. When this happens there about a 30 second retry that the server keeps trying until it disconnects. This disconnect is suppose to happen because the server is doing its job. What we need to get mad at is the client, our game, hanging for that window where we can get kicked. This engine was never built to have to sync to an outside source. Bethesda needs to fix our end and we need to stop yelling at the cloud. I need to sit down and make a video about this and the inventory lag we all still face. Both of which are just our game having issues.
---
Do note that this isn't a hardware issue on our side. The most overkill builds down to potato hardware that shouldn't be running the game run into this issue. It's the game engine itself that's half baked.
---
If they release a whole new game in six months, I'm in. But if not...
---
Nope. Getting 120% cores still. Tried some other perks, like the science ones. Also nothing... 
---
I know, right. 
---
The truth hurts them. 
---
Love his videos. He's brilliant
---
A few patches ago, I had several cases where an enemy was invisible to either me or my buddy. You get sound effects like you're getting hit though, the hp doesn't just drain silently. 
---
Yeah lol competitive shooters aren't really my thing. Just want something to kill some time while I wait for red dead to still not get an update. I think it'll end up coming down to whether my buddy is gonna get it or not
---
I feel ya, i have so many stims, magazines, useless to me plans and other brikabrak but they just run. I understand why now, just got pwnd in the Whitespring yesterday and I'm lvl 135. But we need the separation of PvP and PvE soon so those of us that want to rebuild Appalachia can get on with it.
---
Ah ok, I didn't play that one. Did the 95% load bug get fixed for that? 
---
Because now I actually remember what it was and ik how to already do it because I've done it multiple times in fallout 4 and just haven't used it in awhile so I forget what it was and you can still do it on 4 if you dont have the patches 
---
You sound like me haha. Only game i've ever been good at pvp is halo. I suck at most other games! And that boredom is what is driving me to do it in f76. I don't understand the mentality if some people, where is the fun in someone continually not putting up a fight, right?
---
I've been mainly hunting down anyone i see with a bounty. Makes for some good fun if you rp the sneaking around, hunting them down and bang! Sneak crit black powder rifle, in your wanted ass face! I will have my trophy for killing 20 players, one day!
---
This "critique" sounds like you simply watched a bunch of Youtubers play the game and criticize it, rather than actually play it yourself.
---
1.  "Arbitrary PVP"  I really don't think you understand the words you're using.  Plenty of reasons to criticize their PVP methodology, but calling it "arbitrary" makes zero sense.
---
2.  There are a number of NPCs, they just aren't human because all of the humans in the area are dead...BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE OVERARCHING STORY, WHICH YOU WOULD REALIZE IF YOU PAID ATTENTION WHILE PLAYING.
---
3. There's a LOT of story out there, you just have to actually LOOK for it, the game doesn't drag you through it.  It's also fragmented, so it isn't one overall narrative, but a bunch of smaller ones that contribute to a larger picture.
---
4.  Bethesda has regularly communicated with the player base.
---
That said, there are plenty of reasons to criticize this game, but these points are just recycled garbage, and you're way off base.
---
had this been post 1 month ago it would have been downvoted to Oblivion. The fact it is getting attention means there is a major cognitive shiuft with players.
---
I believe that it is like planning for a huge big wedding and you have pored a lot of your money into it.  Then 4 months before the wedding you relise this will never work and that this marriage would be the worst thing in the world, but now you are stuck. If you cancel the wedding you are out so much money, so you decide to go ahead. You plan on doing the wedding pay everything off and just cut and run and run 6 month after the wedding. 
---
This is Bethesda to me, they released this game to cover their costs and make some money but I just do not think their heart is in it. Otherwise they would be front of centre reassuring people how committed they are, look here are some of our plans. Al we get unfortunately is "we are looking at that foir a future update" and the lowest effort "fixs"
---
The future of F76 will be decided not by the DEVs, NOT BY US, but by a nerdy little accountant based on a simply algorithm - which path is more profitable.
---
Fallout 76 - The Perfectly Preserved Pie is a LIE!
---
No
---
Yea I’ve met invisible ninghouls and this wasn’t that and it being Morgan town airport there wouldn’t be anything that strong to drain me that fast
---
If shes hot: Yes.
---
If not: No. It's very bad.
---
They're not super rare drops from normal sb, but I suppose a lot of people just find them annoying to fight and avoid them.
---
I've been wondering why stims lost so much effect for me. I thought it was a bug... but it was just the healing factor mutation. I didn't even consider they're considered a chem.
---
Fun story!  I found a paper bag with 900+ stimpaks and 1200+ shotgun shells right outside of Vault 76.  No one was around, and this was before I learned about dupers and what they do and how they do it.  I picked up the bag and texted all my friends to log on.  Welp, only one got on so I gave him half of everything.  We then got rid of all our carry weight so we could go around Appalachia giving away stimpaks and shotgun shells.  Hahahaaa.  Some lucky ducks got a lot of stimpaks!
---
I'll admit, it has humour and creativity, just focused badly.
---
We WaNt To bE MoRe CoMmUnICatiVE gOiNg FoRwARdS- Beth...( crickets chirp) 
---
Wishing I was in Germany right now I'd definitely buy a used controller for a new copy, then just trade the controller back in
---
The greatest thing is even when you keep the door locked to your generator, and somehow even though they never spawn in your base, you drop in the generator and they are just spawning in the locked room with the generator, and you don't know until you hear it explode lol. 
---
Yep!
---
how much you looking for?
---
I’ve fought my fair share the sniper/shotgun build with ts and aa and dense armour/fireproof makes them pretty simple but this was my first decent drop out of 30 or so
---
Where was this at?
---
Send them in a message to yourself then use the ps4 app to get them on your phone
---
Ahh... I seem to remember having radworms at the time - that may be it
---
I agree! It only makes sense! If they need to keep it balanced, just do what borderlands did and actually make it cost 2 bullets. Its current status makes no sense.   
---
Also I see a majority of people here think you mean TSE no just TS of it. Its kinda funny.
---
Awesome :)
---
Word on the street is Perforating is 40% and Stinging is 30%, but I can’t confirm that. I CAN confirm that they are different values. 
---
Did you play solo or with someone? I'm okay dropping 35 on it but now it's more waiting to see If my friend's gonna get it. I know I wouldn't pay it solo for long Even without major bugs and crashes just because that's how I was with ark ava conan. 
---
You cant be flagged, the genius group over at Bethesda released an out dated version of the game with the last patch, rolling back all the fixes they had made. It's on them not this dude.
---
P.S. I got the last laugh in a way, he was pwning everyone in there for their scrap, all he got from me was a single piece of aluminum
---
Thanks :)
---
Still nothing?  Just ran across this myself but have no key.
---
This is good news, I’ll have to check all three regularly then :)
---
&gt; **Finally, the biggest flaw is Bethesda's silence.** 
---
Yes, and the arrogance and contempt for its player base which it bespeaks.
---
This game could and should have been *so good.* They actually did a terrific job on some of the fundamental challenges of porting the single-player versions to a multi-player game — especially with the new VATS, which I find vastly more believable and immersive than the "I can stop time while I plan my seven-step execution sequence" of the single-player games.
---
And I'm reminded daily, despite the tragic and, yes, *ultimately fatal* flaws you've identified in this game, that its player base is of an amazingly high quality. If they'd bothered to put in even a rudimentary LFG function and paid more attention to offline community building (to encourage clans/teams/factions in a serious &amp; methodical way, channeled and supported and rewarded by Bethesda, they could have had a monster hit, another WoW.
---
Good post, succinctly stated!
---
Did you unlock it? If someone else unlocks it but doesn’t loot it, it’s fine. I did that earlier. It’s only if you pick the lock. 
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Xbox 
---
I’ve heard it drops plans for the Tomahawk, and might be the ONLY source for it. I’m trying to get it right now.
---
If you die to rads that can happen.
---
Rads tick after you die and if that triggers a mutation it will stop you from getting it and not work
---
The whole point of my post is you get a quest AND a marker telling you to go retrieve it. Tell me a newbie is going to know better?
---
Dude... who pissed in your cornflakes? Cause it wasn't me. 
---
No it doesn't/didn't. Two Shot Explosive probably was near it, but just two shot didn't. The current nerf to explosive is fine and would keep the two shot still balanced. 
---
Yeah sure, 
---
Bethesda has never lied. 6 Studios massively contributed to FO76, Canvas bags btw, There's no way they could get higher FOV to work in this game. Etc etc.
---
Bethesda is known for lying. That's something they commonly do. Lie, bend the truth, and scam. Let's not pretend like this is some perfect world where corporations don't act like corporations. 
---
Thankfully consumers actually kept them in check for the most part here. 
---
&gt;Also I see a majority of people here think you mean TSE no just TS of it. Its kinda funny.
---
Someone gets it
---
That's correct.
---
I use a keypad to access my base's secret lair, and a floor pressure plate to exit. It's really not that complicated and actually kind of slick.
---
I can record a video next week if anyone's interested.
---
You're not wrong, but I don't think charging us for the DLC's would fix this.  If anything they might charge us full price and then deliver crap.
---
Please forward all concerns to the Atom Shop
---
Yeah he was always amazing with the builds he did, ahead of most people, always something new (and usually tricky) to try out!
---
I just want to say that I can appreciate people who go out of their way to help low level players in this game. And for the most part, I have had good experiences with higher leveled people. So thanks for your kindness, and I hope more people pick up this kind of generosity. 
---
If you have Stranger In Numbers then Marsupial stops working when your team leaves the game. Not sure about other mutations. Unequip/equip works anyway.
---
Its_Gids is my psn
---
&gt; I think you missed the biggest issue that will kill the game: the inability to monetize it long term.  
---
I respectfully disagree with this. You're assuming — conceding, actually — that long-term, the micro-transaction model is the only viable means of making a profit off developing and supporting a game, and that's an entirely false assumption. It's like saying, "No one in the pharmaceuticals industry can be profitable unless they're selling crack cocaine to junkies and idiots." 
---
constantly doing that as well, get so many quest rewards that are of no use after 600 hrs ingame that what else is there to do, I log in to do the daily challenges and then a few daily events or quests, whatever pops up till I'm bored. Then I go find someone that can use them or a place they will be found by the right minded newbie. I.E. Places that only the most inquisitive will even look for the better loot and the plain jane goes in the overseers stash in Flatwoods or the first campsite.
---
When I was about lvl 12 this guy (about lvl 22 or so) came up to me and helped me fight off some Mole rats, then gave me the trade emote. I usually don't oblige since I heard about that glitch where people can take your stuff from the trade menu, so I gave the no emote and then the heart emote to show we were cool.
---
Well this asshat decided to shoot me in the head as I was walking away and then finish the job with a Mole miner gauntlet. When I came back all my loot was gone. I have been paranoid ever since. 
---
Wow so rude of you. 
---
Not only did YouU AssUmE ThIEr GeNder you also assumed their sexuality.
---
I think what you meant to say was "If you wanna fuck pay the forty bucks if not tell tell your co-worker they're shit outta luck"
---
It's not as bad as it was at launch. But sometimes some crash or disconnect is going to make you really mad. If you can put up with stuff like that the game is great in many ways.
---
No. Not really worth it. Im in the same exact boat minus the amount of playtime. 
---
Because the last few Inside The Vault articles didn’t mention details aside from “we have ideas.. we’re working on a road map (no details on what it may include)...” and then they had the balls to ask the players to give them feedback on enemy fights and other things... its as if no one at Bethesda has read ANYTHING with regards to current feedback on these forums. No one wants weapon and ability tweaks... we want glitches and stability fixes... once this turd is finally stable than go ahead a start working on weapon and ability tweaks.
---
So far every weekly newsletter has been paragraphs talking about everything but saying absolutely nothing.
---
So, three things.  One, it's a multiplayer online game, with survival as the theme.  So you are going to be giving up resources/opportunities to other people during gameplay as a matter of course.  This is inherent in the design of a multiplayer game like this.  Two, there are 3 other places on the map where you can get your opportunity to make the vendor bot spawn, one of those is literally 5 seconds run up to the other bridge (the one up the hill); you tag it and walk back down the rails to make it work.  Three, people who have server hopped and engaged 100s of instances of this encounter (in the spot where people are putting camps) are reporting that the bot STILL spawns just across the road/rails when there is a camp in the way.  
---
Personally, I don't trust Amazon enough to dismiss out of hand and completely the possibility of at least *some* of the instability being their fault. To me it seems like is, and has always been, a company that offers volume, not quality.
---
Having said that, a grace period, or in other words, a timer to rejoin the same game instance after a disconnection or a crash is definitely required, and would at least help with server instability, regardless of who's at fault.
---
Middle Mountain Cabins a little northeast of The Whitespring Station. If you keep selecting the entry it comes up with random "Fun Facts".
---
This happened to me yesterday. Hit white springs after a nuke dropped. Literally dozens of glowing ghouls mob me, suddenly can’t jump. Had to make a break for it, luckily speed demon was still working. Fast travel to camp, marsupial works again.WTF???
---
You know, weirdly, last week I ended up getting a couple Lv. 50 All Rises from vendors.  I've never got the one that "belongs" to me.
---
I dont think its as simple as "people are playing an rpg and you cant handle it."
---
&gt; No one knew how they'd react or what they would say. 
---
Erm, BGS never provided any kind of post-launch support for their previous game. So sure, this was the first multiplayer game they did so there was a chance things might be different, but the safe bet was that they would not have proper post-launch support.
---
I agreed with everything up until you thinking what most gamers are.
---
Thats just a shitty assumption and makes you no better. 
---
Yah, I would actually rather be attacked than invited to hang out or even get loot. I have voice stuff disabled and play this like a solo game with weird NPCs.
---
Absolutely not. I own several two shot weapons, including a 50 cal. Before the nerf, you could just point those guns in the general direction of where you wanted things to die and they would DESTROY mobs like they were made of cardboard. There was no point in ever using any other weapon. 
---
Now these guns still dominate, but at least they don't feel like playing with cheats on anymore. The nerf was 100% legit and justified.
---
128
---
the only problem is there is no new content, and datamined content looks bad. But you still can have 100-200 good hours
---
I honestly never even looked at the binds for emotes. If I wanted to wave back it would require a trip into settings!
---
Yes this is happening to me as well sporadically.
---
Oof why would you support this game
---
Did you play Fallout 4? Did you think Nick Valentine can really be compared to Vendor Bot Greg at the Grafton Trading Post?
---
One's a vending machine. The other is as detailed and engrossing as the protagonist of an entire series of detective novels.
---
Yes, the bots are technically nonplayer characters. But they have almost zero "character," which is to say, ***dialog and content associated with them***. 
---
Whitesprings is a cancer on this game, it's not fun at all, but it's rediculously rewarding. One clear of the golf clubhouse can net like 5 legendaries and a lot of exp. It's broke AF but no one mentions it because they want to keep exploiting it. 
---
Wait, you bought it 2 times?
---
I'll admit that myself and my husband are wary around higher levels players,  but free stuff is gladly accepted or help with higher level boss that we stumble across is a welcome.
---
If you're on ps4 look us up 
---
They said they're working on it but no other info yet.
---
It's called a child that has never had nor ever will have control over their real lives, and killing a player in a game gives them that endorphin rush they will never get out in the real world, same a S#!tposters and potty mouths in voice and text chats, if they said anything like that to real humans in person they would get their teeth knocked down their throats.
---
Uummm I want free stuff😁 see I new mom was wrong... Always accept stuff strangers give you 
---
Truly they need to get rid of the RNG legendary system it's shown that it's more unbalanced with certain weapons and breaks damage scaling, bring back what New Vegas did with types of ammo and weapon parts. You can do this by looting of an enemy, finding, or buying schematics, recipes or parts. This would make players have to find resources to craft the ammo or parts but you would also need to have certain perks to do this it would make people that spec into crafting have a more important role. Also not every weapon would have access to every type of ammo and certain weapons would have specific parts i.e. You could have a malfunctioning pistol receiver that fires two shots, or bring back the laser pistol EC recycler which could restore ammo after a few shots. Explosive ammo would be limited to shotguns, mini guns and Hunting rifles and bows for example but it effects the condition of the weapon more if it doesn't have specific parts. The possibilities could be very deep than the weapon crafting system we have now, it would also eliminate weapons like a ghoul slaying gamma gun and such. 
---
where's your rp community based? i don't use a mic usually so i wouldn't be any good for role playing in-game but i'd definitely be interested in a 76 rp community that extends beyond the game itself.
---
Seems a nice add
---
I interpret it as “come here” and look at the bag. If you take anything, you get shot. ;)
---
Yes they are NPCs, but robots in Fallout are NOT sentient. They have, at times, programming that emulates emotion but they are Toasters.
---
Traditional NPCs are humans or aliens, sentient being that we know have emotions, flaws and human like motivations. We connect to these NPCs cause we can relate to them.
---
That cannot happen in Fo76. They are robots just following their programming.  They sweep floors for 200 yrs, wander forests for 25 yrs, they cannot go beyond that programming. 
---
In a way their cold presences makes the lack of Human NPC even more painful.  Some may like the way Beth did it, but it was an experiment that failed IMO. 
---
This could have worked IF beth had embraced a COOP framework for Fo76.  PvP servers at release or No PvP at all would have possibly saved the game. Instead they gave us an empty, lonely broken world were griefers and cheaters became GODs.
---
Lol. I just drop stuff off at vault 76 now. 
---
They all run away 
---
Meh, its fine, its fallout 4 with friends, no npcs and a shit pile of bugs. But still fun. 
---
How did you played the beta if you are downloading the game in this moment?
---
Yeah, it sucks, but I try not to get too attached to anything in this game.  If something were to happen, oh well, I get to rebuild my house again.  Maybe I'll move to the top of Seneca Rocks next time.  Or that fallen monorail.
---
The problem with my spot is that it has some objective benefits being in reasonable fast travel proximity to each faction's vendor.  Otherwise, I would actually move around more often.
---
It really depends on your play style.
---
I'm at 371hrs and I still have a good time.
---
I am a very very low level... I need your assistance sir please... I'm in need. Help your local low level for only a stimpak a day!
---
I apologize wasn't directed at you Polygon reporter is a moron.  Just saying your good dude it's on Bethesda. At this point they should apologize to you for their game not working, you shouldn't be worried about a ban, the fact that Bethesda makes you feel you have to pre emptively defend yourself is just fucked up.
---
Pressure pad on the floor and the door opens like at the supermarket!

&gt;Friday night a punkish Group of five 30+ lvl players hanging in the Watoga train station pestering players and attacking them if they refused to trade. Then yesterday a 100+ kept jumping around me and flashing his light on and off while I was mid trade to demand my attention . . . Well then he tried to block me from leaving and his mic was hot and he demanded I had to trade those items . . .
---
I swear, its like the playerbase for this game is full of 12 year olds.
---
How do you deal with space issues in your camp? Like max amount of items or materials placed. Keep making out with more I want to do still lol. Do different materials take up different storage space?
---
My friend had like 2 million nades on his account and didn't get banned. Bethesda has almost no idea what users are doing. 
---
Ehh, it's nothing like Destiny if you've played both. Also it's quite a bit better than Fallout 76. I'm willing to put up literally any bet offer that it will outscore Fallout76 at every single aggregate by over 20%.
---
&gt; they said
---
They also said "it just works"...
---
I am just over 120h in and still playing 5 days a week. Sharing playtime with TD1 and now Apex Legends. 
---
I played since BETA.
---
Thanks  I'll do that hopefully a bit easier at least. Wish there was a Bethesda account you could access on pc/phone/browser with photos and account info
---
Worked great for me, certainly better than FO76. Love the diablo style loot and low cooldowns.
---
Prime a Zealot’s gun and just use it for queen fights. Don’t prime anything else.
---
This is why a PVE only server would be nice. No matter what kind of emotes they give you, trolls will get them as well, and use them to trick people to shoot them. 
---
But in that case your home is not secure tho.
---
Sweet comment bro, care to add something useful to a conversation or do you just like chiming in with nothing to add?
---
Be prepared for a healthy dose of frustration, *best case* scenario.
---
Well its slower than before, but not nearly as slow as it should be for an mmoish game
---
If anyone needs one on Xb1, I have the plans
---
Speaking of rebuilding, they need to create community events with that theme. Like, players bring enough special quest items/materials to a train station, and Beth fixes up the joint and it becomes a free fast travel destination. 
---
Since our CAMPs are ephemeral, Beth needs to create more meaningful ways to “rebuild.”
---
I don’t really want to play with PEOPLE but I would do things that supported the COMMUNITY. 
---
In RL I would run too. Just saying.
---
Satire? 
---
If anyone played the Division 2 Beta the servers were broken and nobody could stay connected for more than 5 minutes. They completely resolved the issue in about 30 hours...
---
I hardly used PA to level and now barely ever get into it except to farm flux in nuked zones, and that only because we can't put armour over or under a hazmat suit, we need a more realistic level 5 hazmat suit like you see in our world
---
Although this guy once went thru the trouble to get codes to wmd me in my camp once for taking his power armor.  I heard the siren then the boom while I was crafting then I was scattered into atoms.  I gave him back the power armor and said sorry then he fix my camp and gave me tse shotgun and said "you can take wat I give you but don't ever steal from me again" lol were friends now
---
This is my biggest problem. They promised us transparency... Then they disappeared. All I want is to know where their heads are at and what their plan of attack is.
---
similar style of play but never use PA, opt for radiation suit instead in blast zones. being a steath/sniper build i also almost never get detected and rarely ever need to repair armor b/c i rarely get hit. how does PA effect your stealth btw?
---
Yes totally agree!! I finally helped a level 9 find power armour and gifted 2 fusion cores!!  We have so much love to give!! 
---
Ur welcome 
---
I swear to god dude, if I run into a dog with a gun strapped to it I'm bringing it straight to your camp
---
What the... 😁
---
The canvas bags have nothing to do with the state of the actual game. That’s beside the point. There’s no point in trying have a conversation about this with someone who feels like they’re wronged by a simple video game, but constantly posts about it.
---
can agree with that, actual betas i participated in i was either selected and invited due to playing style or some other preset in a game either from another game in their library, through actions in a differing game, or i applied and filled out an application for and was interviewed. most betas i was involved in required me to do specific tasks daily, repeating them sometimes 100 times, then reporting my experience.. pick this lock 100 times, fight 100 wolves and watch attack patterns/motions. then go to the exact link they provided answering the questionnaire and report any other anomalies you ran across. for example the disarm bug repeatedly for xp would have been found due to someone finding it, clicking it 100 times then reporting that they got xp every single disarm.  
---
beta for this was just really early access, with no real direction or big pointy arrow saying report here.
---
if they really wanted to fix this game they would need to pull an ffxiv realm reborn type of reboot, and that almost bankrupted square enix, but in the end saved SE and made them a stronger company in my opinion.  
---
i dont see that happening here.
---
no 
---
I think ranged weapons were made so weak because those effects existed.
---
Now with those effects out of the way, they just need to undo the original nerf affecting all ranged weapons.
---
If you server hop it should fix it, I has the same but occur
---
Yeah, never had it.  I loaded perfectly for all three days.  Got booted once or twice in the twenty hours I was on.
---
before the game was released I played the beta, and have been following the news about it, it's now on sale for $35. I got it
---
no?
---
If I ever see that place I’m running inside and going down with heart emojis 
---
Spent 3 hours naked at the Whitespring trying to get a bounty off my head for helping defend a site that was unattended and I was given the event as I arrived there. Finaly some dude had just spawned in and whacked me as he ran past.
---
ikr, i'm 631 hrs in, but don't want to play anymore. We need weekly content update which we'll never get
---
Not a PA player but a PA collector and I will buy some good paint sets for my PA. I am really hoping they introduce a way to display PA at the CAMP in the future. I like to build a CAMP with a separate floor just for my PA for display. Like the Batcave with all the Batman gear on display.
---
I do enjoy getting into my PA occasionally to go melee something with my All Rise. Always fund and then my paint job needs to be on point.
---
that's a bad mentality, but thank you
---
I’m only level 35, and I get wary of the ‘older kids’, but if someone did this to me, I’d WANT him to kill me.
---
A salty bag? 10 points!
---
Well how come you played the beta and you're only getting it right now 
---
Yeah, like a multi bobble headed bleed sledge to the back of my skull.
---
Been there.  Nty
---
Its Bethesda's job to fix it. Until then I'm shooting till it's dead. Nuff said. 
---
well at least ur joining in a better state than launch
---
I tested that recently and came to the same conclusion.
---
you only get to play the beta if you preorder the game?
---
I still have some hope from the game but I actually quit playing till something big happens, I've done everything there is to do, 5 characters will full equipment, gotten all holo tapes and games, gotten all locations, seen all easter eggs, done the main quest, all the would be left is getting every plan and I see no need for that. For now the onyl thing I would suggest is they do a FFXIV, shut the game down, rework it and fix everything and re-release it, that would be the only sensible thing to do.
---
every time I see the subtitles for Super Mutants going "Oof" show up on my screen I laugh 
---
Could be useful for some extreme overclocking, though. 🤔
---
I thought it went up to E in fo4?
---
Idk if that's a bug or not, its a legit form of aggro, You chuck a bomb in someones general direction even if you miss they are likely to look for you and punish you for your attempt. It sounds like reasonable mechanics to me. 
---
Where are the clans and the player driven politics and the raids and sieges? Could you imagine mass pve where you have to raid a place that has a lot of resources? Or communal CAMP areas that eventually evolve into fortresses because clans/guilds can pool resources to make permanent bases? Lots of things that could be that would turn this into a true multiplayer experience rather than a single player experience where you occasionally see another player.
---
Apology accepted. I am a little concerned that the fact Polygon has picked up on it and "Reached out to Bethesda Softworks representatives". It's not exactly going to help my case.  
---
I'd say I'm more concerned that I shared the photos online that would be skirting the ban. I stand by my plea not to ban me for blabbing my mouth lol
---
It’s still pretty broken. A lot of people left and there’s still no real end game.
---
Shame ya not on ps4. 
---
So fallout 4 didn't have post launch support?
---
It can, I said it could be upgraded to B, I didn't say that was the final upgrade
---
It’s not going anywhere, because it just froze when I nuked the SBQ.
---
Pop a grape mentat also to get the best deals. 
---
I had heard that the atom shop was a way of funding expansion content without doing the usual of gouging you in advance for a season pass. 
---
And for me, if that’s true. They can sell all the two day exclusive fishing pants they want. 
---
What I wouldn’t mind is an external website or phone app that tells me what’s for sale today without needing to log in to the PlayStation mindyou.
---
 No, I have no issues with my internet or other online games or services. So ima not gonna mess my things up just cause Bethesda can't get their assets up and make the game work properly 
---
Why so I can be like you and tell someone sharing their opinion that they are wrong for sharing their opinion? Lol nah I’m good, I try not to waste people’s time with bullshit forced morality, unlike yourself.
---
same issue with this quest and the only reason i tried the above solution is because of another quest line where you had to load the holotape.  So questline still broke if you have too many holo's in your bag
---
I'd understand if they went around looking in the area, but they home in on your *exact* location.
---
Brother, this game has no future.
---
Live for today and get your 60 bucks worth.  It’s all downhill from here...and we’re starting in the gutter.
---
"hey we have to kill the scorch queen again!"
---
Ok why?
---
"Cause... Um... The terminals stopped working!"
---
This also happens to me with my manly body wearing a red and white woman's swimsuit with my mascot head on
---
But it isn't interesting in A DAMN RPG. Also, you figure what happened with the scorchbeasts like 2 hours into the game, so there goes the mistery.
---
I’ll have to keep an eye out for that one. 
---
What do they do?
---
Like the #2 pencil....what happened to 1 lol 
---
Is that the same as the one with the cats following it as mentioned by another Redditor? If not, I’ll have to hope I can find her when I’m tired one night 
---
Yeah aggro is aggro imo
---
They have to have a regular stream of income to pay for development of new content. Future DLC is going to be free, they've said that from the beginning. Other than micro-transactions, how are they going to pay to keep things going?
---
At least the shit in the Atom shop you know exactly what you're getting when you click purchase. As opposed to loot boxes where you *might* get something you want. 
---
So to go with your pharmaceutical analogy: They are selling bottles of actual medicine, instead of hundreds of bottles of placebos with an occasional bottle of medicine thrown in. 
---
Sound like,y Godfeast
---
I have played this shit for some 80+ hours, and never seen this guy.
---
I try to spend time at the overseers camp each time I log in to craft lvl 5 armor and weapons for the stash
---
I LOVE stuff!
---
I’ll take whatever stuff you have to give!!!
---
They are a super rare mod sold in the enclave bunker. Lots of server hopping to get 2 or buy them from other players. What system are you on?
---
Oh definitely, it’s not just the references to other things that make them great it’s the way they’re executed. This was a first for me in 3 months of playing and it honestly freaked me out a first. If I posted the full video you’d see me spending the first 30 seconds trying to figure out where the sound was coming from and trying to get it through vats XD
---
This is literally what i want to see
---
I'm legitimately curious, did *you* actually purchase the one with the canvas bag? Or are you outraged on other people's behalf?
---
Haha, that’s fallout at its best though, middle of a boss fight but no bother for a mr handy and some rad rats to come strolling by 😂
---
Maybe because it was referred to as T-51b Power Armor since FO1? It's a lil nod.
---
Pretty much they need to team up groups of monsters to make them more challenging. MOnsters of different types. Let Super Mutants and Scorched "Tame" pets, kind of like players, Super mutant death claws, or Mr Gutsys, Scorched Assaultrons ect. The way the mobs are separated in 99% of cases is weak. 
---
Maybe its intentional. If it wasn't I'm sure they'd add it to the list since its easy to fix.
---
And they seem to only fix easy stuff.
---
Does teaming up make you share, instanced, loot between the team members, but not the XP from the kill? 
---
I gave up looking for them. Just use t60. Easier to find.
---
Fixing a few lines of code never was so damn dramatic, you'd think they were coding a nuclear launch program from how long this is all taking.
---
Fix a few lines of code, tweak only small things before you add content, fix serious unintended bugs before adding content, make the server interaction pristine, extremely few disconnects considering some activities are basically broken by disconnects, before adding new content.  Once that's all done, add new content and repeat: Fix coding, tweak the little things, fix bugs, server stability, add new content, repeat.
---
Its not hard and this game could've made an extreme amount more had it not been slaughtered to be quickly released.  Another year could've seen this game built far better with more quality about it.  Whoever the big fellows up top are who forced this game out, they should all be fired for losing their company *so much damn money*.  This game would've been huge had they just took the time.
---
As a low level, being around high level players is very dangerous. Even if you aren't trying to kill them, if a mob shows up it will be scaled to you and absolutely decimate the low level player. I always avoid high level players unless it's a very safe place and I can be sure enemies won't spawn. 
---
Xbox one X,  have server hopped probably 1K plus times over 2 characters.  Have built every type of power armor in game.  Have c as liberated shocks on multiple sets.  Just want as as et for my X01....lol.
---
Each week I pick a persona and RP it. Drug dealer one week: "Wanna buy some druuugs"
---
Next week, first responder ( my default ), today, started a british gentleman, offering spots of tea and offering no weapon no armour boxing matches, dressed in a white/black tux witha bowler and monocle. 
---
Next persona, nuka cola jacket and t51, running around telling people to drink nuka cola, offering samples, and "grumbling" about having to restock the machines.  Ive made quite a few people laugh, and made some great friends.
---
God people are way to close minded these days 
---
I sent you a request
---
I have one shock.. Make me an offer. 
---
I swear I’ve read this exact thread before. Deja vu. 
---
How this isn't feedback? 
---
Have the T60.  Do you know or have you heard if any fit the Ultracite armor?
---
Are you Geoff from AH
---
I made a whole thread on this not too long ago. We were able to consistently reproduce it over and over and over. In short, the game loads what is there when you load in. If you waypoint or walk through a door before the first player loads in, you are invisible to them. To avoid the issue go one at a time making sure each player is fully loaded in before you waypoint or use the door. 
---
This is absolutely a valid point. I feel like it takes some of the fun out of adventure mode though. 
---
My main fear here is that when survival mode comes out they will not allow you to switch back and forth ( this is an extremely unpopular opinion and I get why so feel free to downvote my comment ) but yet they also strip some of those PVP elements from adventure mode while implementing this change. I also understand that there is fear of duper's etc that would poison this new mode but there are lots of us out there it would enjoy this new mode and enjoy being a good guy in that so to speak.  Which is I think another important reason why a very basic karma system could be implemented that would reset weekly.  
---
I guess my point being that I like a little spice and my game play now and then and giving me the ability to switch on a character that I've put so much time and effort in would be nice but I understand that it is an unpopular opinion from my view point. 
---
I upvoted for that portal reference
---
Yeah might be time to just buy a set haha. They aren’t too pricey. I’d sell you two but I’m pc
---
It isn't bad as other people make it out to be.
---
have you been banned? Cuz they were pushed last month. 
---
Happens when u get radworms and recover from them. 
---
By "post-launch support" I mean "bug fixes". Not new DLC content.
---
I'm reminded of the [Spruce Goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-4_Hercules), built mostly out of wood, which still has the largest wingspan of any aircraft ever flown.
---
Not that I know of. I haven’t been playing against the rules or glitching.
---
this spot is really good. can get tons of stuff really fast. Camp Mcclintock is excellent for springs. 
---
I need one 1000 caps, my gm is zetsubou pro 
---
There’s subtitles?? Do they show the pining for magazine finder etc?
---
I'm in the same boat. I haven't played at all because of them and it feels bad. 
---
Use your mic maybe? I’m still only 35 and am anxious of higher levels, but if they used their mics more to speak to me I’d be pretty chilled. 
---
The first time I encountered a couple of people I was building a camp and I heard a friendly voice say “nice little set up you’ve got here”.  I was instantly at ease. We waved, jumped and there was no murdering.
---
It was also at that moment that I realised you could actually talk in the open world... and my mic may have been open since I left the vault....
---
Would love to buy a set,  just are never offered at vendor.  Always have the csps.
---
Homer my son, go into game settings and turn on General Subtitles under Display
---
They pulled a No Man's Sky with ESO though. Bethesda likes money too much. As long as the atom shop is profitable they'll keep updating the game.
---
It has 50% armor piercing. If you have no other armor piercing effects, it’s a big “bonus” for damage. And it’s baseline damage is pretty high. If you have the Incisor perk, which is 25-75% armor piercing, the specialized legendaries will be much more effective.
---
Im only going on what the vault itself looks like which is disarray over a long period of time. So if they add it into a DLC Im not sure they could say it "Just opened" and have the NPCs let free into the world it doesnt appear like anyone (human) has lived in it or could survive in it. If they say "oh its been open before vault 76 was opened" then you contradict the story they have already done and anything that players have completed.  
---
It might come down to FO76 being a large group of people's first time in an online game with PvP elements and a mix of random people you probably would not encounter in normal life. I know for me it was but because of FO76 I now enjoy TD1 and Apex Legends.
---
 I sometimes run into very toxic people with open mics  but lately I just mute them and move on. In the beginning they would get under my skin especially when they start with verbal insults to get a response.
---
Ahh TIL, but do they show the pinger for the magazine and cap stash perk?
---
caps. You 2500 caps.  GM is lukierue
---
why are people so scared? like if they kill you you just lose your junk.
---
Blowing smoke up their collective backsides isn't constructive either. There's a sizable amount of people that are hanging on to this game by a thread and our patience and hope is fading fast, the last two patches did a great deal of harm. 
---
Oh cool, those guys are waving. Turn my back. Murdered.
---
Only at a discount
---
were you holding crazy amounts of any item? 
---
me with my dogs, but no unfortunately. always turn on general subtitles for Bethesda games, their audio is fucky most of the time 
---
That's way to much for me, I'll pass
---
He clearly can’t handle rejection very well. What a toss pot.
---
Is that glitch still a thing? I’ve never traded.
---
Everything's constantly respawning though isn't it? So nowhere is truly cleared. 
---
I feel bad when people offer ... my level 2 character is dying of starvation outside the vault not because they need food, but because my level 300 is too busy fighting the queen to give them any.
---
There are Ultracite Calibrated Shocks, yes. I learned the plan on PC
---
Are you going to stick with the same build or try something different?
---
well thats my real hope that as time goes on they keep adding new ways to play the game - I mean the idea of a pvp survival server sounds great to me but I want some more adventure maybe a no legendarys server option that is more survival oriented where damage is increased for creatures and players to make it a bit more tactical 
---
I'd also love to see wtf is up with those totems everywhere they are not mothman statues - I feel as time goes on that 80+ hours will slowly rise and keep rising and since all the dlc is free not like you have to invest to test
---
I’m trying something different. My last guy was a bit of a hybrid. This time I’m going full strength and stamina.
---
I was hoping for the faction change since they've not done much this year
---
Mt GT is same.. Sent u a message 
---
Apex Legends is the new standard now.
---
I want Fallout Legends next please.
---
I know, right? I was quite annoyed with the bat, so seeing the bot passing by caught me off guard. Took me a little to figure out what the hell wss happening, but when I did i just laughed. Moments like that is why I love fallout games. It makes me forget the issues and puts a smile on my face. 
---
And then the server crashes and I get disconnected....
---
Oh well.. 🙄
---
Or just unerf demo 
---
This isn’t news and if you kept getting points you would be a god and it then would be unfair. 
---
how do you roleplay without chat. insane there isnt one. 
---
If the atom shop had lore based skins and paint sure , if it was reasonably priced , they’re charging 18$ for blue power armour paint... 18$ skin in a 60$ game? If the game was launched as a free to play then sure MAYBE 18$ skins would’ve made sense.. Jesus fuck if you do the math , a few skins and a couple of outfits can easily cost you 100$... which again, would be arguably fair if the game WORKED and was FREE TO PLAY from the beginning.
---
Okay, remove the SaveMyStuff mod on your desktop and lets us know if that fixes it.
---
Correct. But usually after you have cleats location once the enemies don’t really drop loot. Also the boss chest doesn’t have any thing in it after cleared the first time.  
---
Add me! Gt:chiseledhen860 
---
Xbox unfortunately. I made a quick edit in the post to let people know if anyone else needed help on Xbox. 
---
Frequently. 
---
Idk, but I added one of the armor piercing capacitors (the one with faster reload speed, I forget the name) and it made a noticible difference vs super mutants.
---
Early on those were not duping level numbers... 
---
I plan on using this guy as my pvp guy whenever they release  survival mode if they stick to allowing us to transfer characters over. I’m also excited I’ll get to try the brotherhood of steel quest line with this guy as well.
---
I think more often than not, the servers and worlds actually crash and disconnect everyone, so reconnecting is not really an option (but it should be for those rare cases that just you are disconnected).
---
Playing with a party and friends almost exclusively, if one of us was disconnected we all were because the server crashed. It totally sucks. 
---
That one is piercing. It's nice. I went with Perforating because it's "superior". But they never say what that means.
---
That and they will map to my camp and destroy it lol. Not happening. 
---
Its over
---
"I don’t really want to play with PEOPLE but I would do things that supported the COMMUNITY. "
---
This 100%. Fucking bullseye. 
---
I'm playing it right now....  check out swgemu.
---
You can place a floor in front of the wall, then flip the wall, then remove the  outer floor. It just works.
---
I just used wooden foundations and put a wall with a door lol.
---
I really enjoy my second toon since she discovers all kinds of notes referencing events you have no clue about on playthrough one. The notes just connect the different regions for me on playthrough 2 since I now know what they are referring to.
---
not shielded.
---
Woah, I hadn’t even realized higher levels would drop stuff for me.  I may have run away without looking!  Shooting at the bag is a great idea- it’d scare me a little bit it’d make me look.
---
what would be nice is a lock down device that shows a camp on the map but stops it from being attacked by players or creatures would allow people to set up shops and stuff in future without the need for all the random fighting on bases 
---
yea i still love this game, try a new character its amazing!
---
Yeah, there's some glitch I think... I stepped *into* the roof, and couldn't find purchase. Stepping out and jumping wouldn't get high enough to land, then, after a few tries, I fell out and hit the ground, at which point I figured you needed something special to pull it off, so I came here.
---
So *close* on this one!
---
I’ll buy a bloodied .50 cal for the 3k, ign ArcherJG
---
Mega Assaultron Armies. Make it happen, Bethesda. 
---
I server hopped that train car an embarrassing amount of times yesterday and didn't see any bos combat armor plans. If they still spawn there, they are *extremely* rare.
---
I will be there :D
---
Despite my frustrations and even though I have quit playing because of them, I do hope it gets better. I really do.
---
I wouldn't mind more team invites if they gave me a bit more restrictive measures on what people can and cannot do at my camp. I had a party member a long time ago slap ammo stickers all over my camp. Needless to say I'm a bit weary of who I invite now.  All I want is the ability to not let people build anything at my camp and I would party up more. 
---
Oh you poor, sweet child. How I pity you.
---
I got satisfaction out of doing the SBQ twice. After that I nuke locations for my benefit. ( flux, legendaries,etc...).  Its an end game event. Just do it once and be done to close out the story. 
---
You are salty because you can't cheat anymore?
---
Don’t do it.  Just saying.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'm excited
---
I like this. And brings the community together if they wanted to congregate in one area. 
---
I can fit all all heavy gunner, demolition and stabilized lol
---
&gt; Three, people who have server hopped and engaged 100s of instances of this encounter (in the spot where people are putting camps)
---
I have as well, and I have never gotten the enemy encounters or the vendor bot to spawn when the camp is on that side of the lake. 
---
And to add to your other points, that's fine. Just don't get upset when people destroy the camps because they have negatively impacted the other players. This whole thing is getting silly. It's people being selfish about a spot, getting mad and calling other people selfish for showing displeasure with them. 
---
Well this has to be one of the most disingenuous comments I've ever seen. Where was the requirement that the game have *online* and *multiplayer* functions? Your comment said " Name one as flawed as this one that wasn't still in beta." in response to the comment "Name a single flawless game". Tell me, where is the mention of *online* and *multiplayer* in those? Anywhere? Or are you just slapping on the requirement after the fact? Whoops.  
---
Let's talk about those ES games for a minute. Day 1 those games weren't in beta. How many mods were available for them day 1? None. You got the game as-is. There was no such option as relying on the community to fix things. You got the garbage Bethesda served to you, like it or not. Trying to compare a game in a state where it's been patched (both officially and not) for years to a game that's only a few months old is pretty lame. Riddle me this: Was Morrowind as buggy and broken as 76 *without years of patches or community fixes*? Was Skyrim as buggy and broken as 76 *without years of patches or community fixes*? You're arguing something completely unrelated to the original statement.   
---
*Stay on topic here.*  
---
Pointing out other Bethesda games that were horribly flawed on launch is applying "a level of forgiveness to Bethesda that's unwarranted." What? *Pointing out a company's mistakes is forgiveness?* You're making no sense at all.   
---
You can't say a game has been in development because parts were taken from other games. Fallout 76 is running a modified Creation engine, and the Creation engine is a modified Gamebryo engine, which used to be the NetImmerse engine. Why not say the game has been in development since the 90's? Some of the code for the game dates back that far. Prince of Persia 3D, released in 1999, almost certainly shares code with 76. Or is the logical progression of your argument too much of a stretch for you? If you speed up Fallout 4's framerate everything else speeds up. Know what other game that applies to as well? If you guessed Skyrim you're right. Funny how both use the same engine.   
---
Invisible bears, vanishing items, and games that are buggy and fucked without community support are par for the course of Bethesda games.   
---
I think the best part of your comment is this: "the stakes are a bit higher for an online game." Do you remember how ESO launched? Being kicked for chat spamming without using chat. Keyboards not working. Being unable to progress due to invisible NPCs. Being unable to log in with certain character types. A tutorial popup freezing your controls. Sounds amazing, right? Except it's my turn to be disingenuous. That wasn't the release of ESO. That was the release of the console port of ESO, Tamriel Unlimited. TU launched more than a year after ESO came to PCs and yet still had tons of bugs. 76 is just a continuation of a trend. Remember when [thousands were banned for duping in ESO](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-players-discover-serious-item-duping-exploit/1100-6419073/)? None of this is new. Bethesda has screwed up just as much with online games before. It's just now it has the Fallout name tacked onto it instead of Elder Scrolls. That's the only difference. There are no higher stakes. They're going to release a broken game, patch it, and see how many people are dumb enough to buy it. Then they'll repeat with the next game, just like they have been.

“Please don’t run away, I just want to show you my melee weapons”
---
Lack of content and bored teens make it ripe for greifing. Very few mess with my high level char but several mess with my low level alt character. Plenty try to defend this calling it raider cosplay but it’s just asshole behavior. Fairly easy to avoid them with good tactics in most cases and also quite easy to get even if they are acting alone
---
Bethesda gave out 3 codes to everyone who preordered it, and someone posted a code on here
---
so like every single other fallout game before this one
---
Decepticons CHARGE!!!
---
That's interesting!
---
I'm glad, kinda sucks you're not allowed to have fun here.
---
I'll go back to the hidey hole at r/fo76filthycasuals 😂
---
If I had those kinds of sales skills, I'd be a millionaire. 
---
Seen claw at vendors recently. Never seen a drop or learned from hundreds of claw breakdowns.
---
I'll be there
---
145 here, the game is unsurprisingly unrewarding currently endgame.  Made another character, 21 right now, but yes it is definitely more fun.  It's definitely the journey and not the destination, I guess.
---
 Just run to the door. I usually have 1/5 health left. ;)
---
I played the game for hundreds of hours and posted dozens of hosts on bugs and even made videos of bugs in the game to try and help it get fixed so please fuck right off
---
U, no.  I wouldn’t do that to my worst enemy. Sorry.
---
That's a nice Troubleshooter Marine arm. I like it. Too bad you're on PC.
---
Bethesda allowed you to invite friends to the beta
---
Well I would think this is relatively obvious.
---
At the same time I probably wouldn't have thought about it on my own.
---
So here have an updoot
---
This but without the sarcasm tbh.
---
No. You'd do better setting $35 on fire; at least you'd be warm.
---
Shit. Didn't know that, but yeah, I guess so! 😂
---
If i had to log out there then only in Hazmat Suit
---
I dunno, I haven't kept up with all the patches very well. The few times I have traded with people it hasn't happened, but considering the long grind to find loot I'm not eager to find out. 
---
I found one today at enclave, was quite shocked lol
---
I always just go to my camp. Never log out at Whitespring.
---
Omfg. The ammo that made everything attack shit around it was always my fallout fav.  
---
I used that to soften targets all the time and here I thought I just was missing recipes to make the ammo.
---
I never thought it’d be a barrel mod- another fing counter intuitive piece of crap design decision.
---
Arrrghhhhh
---
I apologize in the name of the brotherhood, its shameful how some of the scribes act, unless you are a ghoul , mutant , or any other abomination, no brotherhood member should attack you. I've seen many raiders wearing uniforms of our ranks , likely to ambush wastelanders such as yourself . I will file a report to the home base in the west. Our purpose here in Appalachia is to handle the sierra bravos , not terrorizing citizens. 
---
Ad victoriam 
---
You're assuming there are any friendly players left. As far as I can tell, all that's left are griefers, dupers, and salty loners like me.
---
in the previous titles if you picked a perk it stuck with you through your playthrough, you couldn't remove it if you wanted to (well, on PC you could with the console). they did it this way to balance otherwise everyone would be steamrolling everyone else with heavy guns 
---
Well to be honest it's partially sarcasm partially not, mainly not. But I figured I'd put the /s in for good measure. 
---
Yesss fallout needs more people like you. I will most definitely add you for future gifts. Thanks in advance! 
---
Plans aren't always the same either.. it seems that vendors have a limited amount of space, so when you buy a plan and learn it, a new one will sometimes appear for sale
---
This. I'd love the Blackbird paint for my X-01, but I got this game for Christmas, after the paint had disappeared. 
---
It'd be a lot cooler if this didn't happen
---
They do tell you in the information posters that any person, regardless of rank, will be treated as hostile upon entering a silo if said person is not accompanied by a rocketeer (?) or whatever they called that job. Hence why all the robots and turrets treat you as an intruder.
---
Apart from that, yes it sucks that SBQ loot is mediocre and all three silos look the same.
---
Probably because some of it is. 
---
I think pretty much every weapon goes to the high levels if they can be crafted. If they are found thats a different story. Overall niche weapons like the ripper are stuck at those slightly lower levels.
---
Liberator Queen (what keeps dropping them?)
---
Behemoth Queen
---
“Raider” quests should drop them. Not sure how many count, but I know for a fact One Silent Night does. I got light raider arms plans from it once. Rare drop though, I’ve done it 20 or so times, only gotten that one.
---
Just thought I'd add I won't spam invites to join up because honestly- I can't stand this shit. The lone wanderer is my true calling 😂
---
I consider stashing junk like saving regularly on those old games that used to crash a lot.
---
About 30 percent done 
---
I try to stash my junk and teleport to a safe place (like vault 76) before logout.
---
They were called modders, then Beth got greedy and tried to put a fence and a pricetag on modder content, making sure they would get paid for someone else's work.  They shit the bed on that one - and now FO76.
---
I loathe the entire SPECIAL system in this game, if I'm being honest. The cards are interesting, in theory...but lets be real. The idea that you can swap out knowledge is just, dumb. "Oh. I'm SUPER STRONG. I can Carry SO MUCH". Wait.."now I'm super smart and can craft everything"...It's the least immersive system they've ever used in any fallout game, and that's saying something. 
---
Buddy, this game is dead. The servers will be shut down for good before 2020, mark my words.
---
Progress is illusion. Your choices don’t change anything
---
Don't log out in commonly nuked zones. We don't talk about it because it's common knowledge.  If you MUST log out in whitesprings or the bog, get into some power armor so you don't insta-die on login. 
---
Want to sell it?  Message me if you do.
---
Love this thread! I’ll join OP in saying feel free to add me on Xbox - *NukaColaSquish* if you need any help levelling up doing missions, or food/resources/ammo/gear.. I’ve got a pretty good camp if you need food purified water etc.. feel free to loot the garden. 
---
There's no one with any ability to change the game that gives a flying f\*\*\*. Save your breath. 
---
From what I know the chainsaw, drill and ripper. Stringer and flare. 
---
You must be fun at parties, assuming you get invited to parties that is.
---
Thanks for explaining, to be honest i'm not really paying attention to posters, terminals, holotapes. It feels artificial. Even having robots like rose would've been a much better way of providing info...
---
If there are preexisting meat piles killed during the nuke you may find hardened mass. I feel like it is harder to find than glowing mass now a days though
---
I run t-60 legs for the repair cost, but yeah, I've been actively looking as I go for my sister who's running full x-01. Neither of us have seen a single shock in the last...two weeks?
---
Bold of you to assume I even go to the parties I get invited to (hate parties)
---
37turn ins. Nothing but a single star mutants combat leg with crap stats. Or, and on a look run whilst at the bunker, accidentally deleted my left armour leg. :-( and this, we call fun. Lol 
---
The glitch was never real, it was a troll on players...and unfortunately it worked, because months later and people still believe it.
---
There are bos events around watoga area that have a good chance to give plans as well. The one at fort defiance and distant thunder and so on
---
I did the same but I’m nowhere near your level on my first character. I’m only 52 or something, but I didn’t focus on my build too much so it’s all over the place at the moment.
---
My new character is going to be my “group up” character. Focusing on medic and a bit of rifles with all the perks that have to do with grouping up. I’m bad with socializing in games, and figured the best way to do it would be to make a character build focused on grouping up
---
I just do squats in front of a bag but people still run away... if you need help/stuff I’m on Xbox- NukaColaSquish 
---
Yeah well I still play Battlefield 4 and honestly it's crazy fun on Operation Metro, wasn't around for the launch but hopefully Fallout 76 will get better enough that people buying it a good while from now will have a better experience then those of us around at the launch.
---
Vanilla nondlc Skyrim also ran near flawlessly for me for over a year, so let's hope that they'll continually improve and polish the game over time.
---
This appears in the apparel tab, not junk tab.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGVcufnoY4E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGVcufnoY4E)

Rent it from Redbox !
---
Icing on the fucking cake: had a TSE Shotgun equipped when I completed the Voice of Set quest by loading the tape into the Fabricator and now it's just fucking gone.  Not on the ground, in my inventory, in my stash... just fucking gone. And my game has crashed twice since this original post. 
---
Does he go Ass first into danger?
---
Everyone wants their version of GTA Online, assets bought and paid for years ago - a small team pushing out content that feeds directly into their marketplace.  It works so well they get content updates numerous times a year.  What the one year MBAs at Beth, with their Brook Brothers at discount clothes forget - GTAO is based over a triple A game, not an online platform over a new map and an asset rip.
---
Yeah.. I only run to tiny levels if their near the mine. Recruit or kill. 
---
Definitely. The game is flawed that for sure and I still hope that add more content. They said they are but who knows when that will be with them still trying to fix the base game. Maybe a new character can hold me over until then. It’s definitely has helped me remember what I liked about the game. 
---
I’ve played it solo, but made some pretty decent friends playing it who I’ve hung out with, done events and quests with too.
---
All rifle perks work well also bloody mess. 
---
Use tank killer too for amour penetration and stagger chance.
---
Get ready to be downvoted into oblivion by the fanboys.
---
Just a reminder, the top thread in this subreddit a week or two ago was literally a guy *begging* for more microtransactions, he got a couple thousand upvotes. That's the kind of user that frequents this sub.
---
Same here... I'm on PC and it seems like most of the folks I see talking about being griefed are on console. I've got somewhere north of 450 hours angry I only had 1 encounter I'd classify as a griefer.  
---
Commando for auto and rifleman for semi-auto
---
You must know everything, you should go in and add better, more sensical outfits and skins our grandiose LoreMaster, savior of the Atom Shop 
---
That doesn't mean the story is engaging or even very well written. You can make up a story about literally anything.
---
I have not ever seen one for sale, since game came out.
---
I'm constantly dumping ammo for low lvl people and dancing around it trying to get them to pick it up. All different kinds to, but they just point their guns and back away :(
---
Mine do the same thing, workbenches and camp alike. Mole rats, rad rats, dogs, and the occasional wolf stroll right past mine. Super mutants are almost always stopped and scorched just about every time. They all do waaayyy too much damage for my very secure base 
---
Another cool thing about Charisma builds is you get to tame animals for your camp. It’s kind of broken at the moment but Bethesdas said it’s on their to do list of things to fix. Hopefully sooner rather than later because it’s a cool feature.
---
I have the xbox app on my phone too, I use it to message other players without having to pull up the intrusive menus/map
---
When I can literally get a better drop of a legendary ant at Whitespring than I can off the game Boss, something is really wrong. I cannot believe Bethesda didn’t figure this out. If she dropped the yet to be added presidential seals, then your talking. Or better yet, maybe a 4 or 5 star item. A guy can dream. 
---
They knew it was garbage before release, so the paywall was  upfront to ensure they'd get the most dollar per hyp generated - the legitimate backlash was probably considered - but they thought they shat gold and could do no wrong - at the expense of Beth fans in general and Fallout gas specifically.
---
Could be caused by getting and then losing Radworms or by losing teammates while Strange in Numbers perk is equipped. This game is so broken it’s almost comical.
---
Nope, I'm suggesting that continuing to comment on a game that they no longer play and clearly have a hate on for is a faulty opinion that can be safely discounted. 
---
I’m pretty sure it’s off
---
I'm saying that there's quite a lot of angry, bitter people, the most angry and bitter matter of fact, that literally do not play the game anymore and only come here to upvote salt posts and post more salt. 
---
After reading through numerous posts, there's a clear bunch dedicated to nothing but adding salt and no more. 
---
Scrap the assaultron blade, get the circuit board!
---
Bloody mess affects also the dmg%?
---
I can’t wait for E3, Howard cannot dismiss this whole thing as another joke like he did last time. Star field is the next in line and they cannot possibly even dare to ask for pre orders, or make special editions with mercha
---
Up their asses and they don't have one.
---
I have a level 103 and a level 74. Between those two characters I have visted the Enclave vendor at least 200 times (no exageration), and never found calibrated shocks or the jetpack mod for X-01.
---
Right I get that, but this is the equivalent of leaving a shitty Yelp review, and then continuing to leave more shitty Yelp reviews having never gone back to the restaurant ever again, while also commenting on other people's negative experiences.
---
Like I said, I didn't even bother counting posts with negative content. I only counted people that literally don't play anymore. 
---
Vendor bots arent Npcs, they serve the same function as a buy or sell menu that you could bring up in your pipboy. The C in npc stands for character
---
They can’t even blame it all on one studio, Howard said himself that ALL studios were involved lol
---
Don't logout at whitesprings with lots of junk.
---
Its the #1 place to nuke for a lot of ppl
---
U deserved that for logging out in a popular nuke zone
---
Not an option on PC.
---
Says the guy who doesn’t understand why gator claws weren’t in the game 
---
It's the internet. I'll be fine. The mods can ban me if they don't like it and I won't have lost much of anything.
---
No, the story is a result of corporate budget planning: design this game with no NPCs because it's too expensesive.   Or, the budget of the game was flexible and they decided to cutout NPC settlements in favour of something else.  In both cases the medicore writers are left with a gaping chasm of nothing, and this is all they could think of.
---
its annoying as hell lol. Wish I could find a solution.
---
How about we make this pet a Human. Give them a rifle and the ability to equip armor. Have them make witty quips about the location or situation every now and then. They like you enough, you get boosts.
---
Call them "Companions".
---
...oh, wait.
---
Honestly, just wearing power armor and approaching me is a bit aggressive, a bit hostile.
---
Gears are either not in the list or run out quickly.
---
Liberty Prime, but a communist.
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about friendo. 
---
There's a surprising number of people that will tell you every two minutes they don't play anymore and paradoxically how bad the game is and why do you keep playing. 
---
Lol. I'll give you an upvote for the honesty. 👍😂
---
Did you do the event?
---
It probably at least made a profit given the sheer number of asset flips from FO4.
---
The problem is that there are a couple hundred corpses and most of them are holding 8 or more personalized sets of drops.
---
I duo'd a SBQ recently, and there was zero loot lag on any corpse and we were able to easily kill everything she spawned.
---
Right, except a sizable half of the group think doesn't even involve itself in the subject matter anymore. 
---
Someone likened it to Yelp reviews and people leaving nasty comments, which is a good approximation. The difference would be people continuing to visit the same restaurant and continuing to leave shitty reviews even though you've never eaten there again.
---
Can you enter into any of them? Or are they locked?
---
This is only for pc I'm guessing?
---
&gt; Actions speak louder then words
---
By Bethesda every action in regards to 76 they took was lazy and showed they took their fans for suckers. You are that sucker
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/M1JBTIN
---
super duper doesn't occur on bulking.
---
If your build is done at 50 then it probably sucks.
---
So many good perks show up at lvl 45+ 
---
You don't find a *little* odd in this scenario that not only do people complain about a game they don't play anymore but a couple literally have never played it?
---
It would be like someone trashing a movie they've never seen before, not even clips, but because someone on reddit said it sucked they've made up their mind that it's the worst movie ever. 
---
Delusion.
---
I only run the first point of each rifle perk, and the damage is enough for everything. The second and third points only give half the value of the first, so that's 6 whole points you can spend elsewhere. Can move those out of perception for more luck for mutations/critical, etc. Long shot is worthless. It only works on sighted and even then not very well. The wording is misleading.
---
And then you tp to the area and do the event. Then profit.
---
Sorry, what's the problem again? 
---
Thanks. But I get the same thing.  And it’s not just the right leg.  It’s all of it.  I got the helmet, left leg, and torso done but it won’t let me make any more.   I have enough Mariel’s for at least a couple more. 
---
T-51b is the official power armor. The Sole Survivor was just able to upgrade the T-51, T-60, T-45, X-01 because he's a good mechanic... I guess.
---
Eh, my sister just picked the game up and within twenty minutes she's like "People have been complaining about this!? This is great!"
---
I'm still having a good time, I've got a crew still having a good time, that's all that really matters to me. 
---
Fallout hoarding is a base part of the game since fo1.
---
We shouldn’t suddenly be so extremely penalized for it.
---
Fuck that.
---
Try having the materials needed in one place, either on your person or in your stash
---
Well you won't see anyone who crouches, so exact pop is always unknown. But if you have 7 high level people the queen shouldn't be a problem. 
---
Because console.
---
Hey me too! I now have my camp kind of hidden not near anything but still freak out when I see high levels on the map near it. I will legit avoid going back to camp to keep them away until they go somewhere else. I know OP means well but too many people in this game live to just fuck with other players.
---
That's the thing though.
---
Bethesda doesn't care why ppl are still playing, they care about why ppl are leaving.
---
So in essence the opinion of ppl that left is more important.
---
GT: X SO X FATAL X 
---
Move either all mats to stash or to inventory. 
---
Most games? Hardly any games follow that schedule.
---
Queen is easier with less ppl.
---
You got me....damn. 
---
Same happens to me with .50 ammo
---
Wow rude much?! The word super wasn't there when I commented. But then I'm not perfect like some of you pretend to be.
---
It's not the ratio, as you will note I did not count negative comments, only comments from posters admitting they do in fact no longer play the game. 
---
One of the biggest criticisms early on was getting your C.A.M.P. displaced, which is no longer a factor. If you haven't played since, you have an outdated version of the game in your mind you're still upset about. Which is fine, it *was* annoying and now is much better. But to keep coming back to the sub *just* to bitch about how the game is reveals a startling lack of self awareness. 
---
Don't take it the wrong way, some of us are idiots and forget you can emote in the first place lol.
---
It worked. Thanks!
---
Uhh you drop a bag of something for a player  to look at and then shoot them if they take anything?
---
. . . I don't think you understand what dropping is. You drop it, it's no longer yours. Invite them to a trade. And either wait for requests or offer up items. 
---
But have fun shooting me. Lol. I barely take damage from hostile players now. 
---
It’s worked!  Thank you!
---
Yeah. How many .... were there
---
Rad Worms currently affects everything good and bad by 50% like mutations, chems, food and drinks and most probably other diseases as well.
---
If you nuke it, they will come.
---
Try using the spotlight I've heard rumors that it helps the turrets 
---
Your welcome, it’s just another bug they’ve introduced lol
---
Again, the point wasn't to track down negative comments in general which would have been a much more extensive list. It was to track down negative comments from people *that literally do not involve themselves in the game this community exists to talk about*. Huge difference. 
---
I think you misunderstand my comment but could be my English is just too bad to understand. 
---
I do the trade emote
---
Oh no doubt it'll do better as they completely screwed it and I'm done since the scorch beast attack update was announced but I still won't be buying it. Tried the Anthem beta and finished Destiny 2, didn't like either of them. The enemies are still generic bullet sponges and adding a flight mechanic that yanks you down to the floor every few seconds, instead of just balancing it in a different less fun police way like making enemies fly too, won't stop it being the same damn game. Want a game in the same genre that's not a clone? Look at Borderlands, still a shoot and loot game with multiplayer and endless guns like Destiny/Anthem but is completely different (and 100x better).
---
I mentioned that I did try it at the end of my post and it made no difference. I was hoping it would though. 
---
Do you mean that if someone drops a bag. It's only for looking. Not for taking taking items or you will be shot?
---
If so, those players are jerks.  Lol 😅
---
Just "tried" a white springs.  
---
Clean and fresh server (did a group of 4 and join)..  
---
Nuked.    
---
Average of 5 minutes for anything that turned into a meat pile to load, 50/50 if it was a corpse you could loot it before it turned into a meat pile.   
---
It's getting old, fast.
---
Dude, if it takes you 2 -3 reloads to kill a  super mutant with a LMG, you might wanna try aiming.
---
Todd will put on his sincere sweater, sit next to the fire and say:
---
We've learned so much.
---
We hear you.
---
We want to make the best game we can.
---
We have a hard throbbing pre-order deal for you for Starfield - you're going to love it - prepare your money spinchters for the best thing ever!
---
They won't apologise.
---
Oh man! Did I miss an edgelord having a nervous breakdown!? Cruel fate. 
---
Ya I just learned about that recently actually. My original character only has a couple points in Charisma so I haven’t had a chance to try it out yet. I’ll definitely have to give it a try on the new character 
---
Disagree, two shot is so overpowered relative to other legandaries it is a necessity. A level 20 two shot does more damage than a base level 50 pre nerf
---
I don’t know, man.  When you run at me, holding a modded minigun, yelling indiscriminately, I get KINDA suspicious.... maybe I’m paranoid
---
I see it fairly often. I’m not totally sure what the hell a “daily” quest is supposed to be, since loads of the “dailies” don’t trigger daily. 
---
Tnx for your sacrifice.  Made me laugh
---
... or just go to morgontown highschool and fix that error in 10 minutes.
---
Yep.  Did the same thing earlier today.
---
Just trying to make all these mistakes before someone else does
---
Really frustrating that they revamp weapon sales and not make the rules clear. Seems like at least some vendors have partial ramdom drops
---
I feel for you, it was rough to watch happen. My girl came downstairs worrying someone had broke in
---
Its not so much the LVL 100 players I mind, its the LVL 60+ mobs that pop up around them.
---
Fuck no.
---
Expand, I’ve heard it’s a good source. And for reference, am I going to be able to find 500+ plastic?
---
I would like them to implement a temp team feature. I want to team up for an event only. Finish the event and the team disbands automatically.
---
Yeah but none of those can be touted in a press release to try and desperately get more people to buy the game. Too bad for FO76, it now has Fortnite AND Apex Legends crushing its back by being free to play and better alternatives for PvP players. And then Anthem is coming out too.   
---
FO76 should really be trying to focus on what sets it apart from other games instead of trying to copy them but worse. They should go full in on persistent player-made communities where each player gets a plot in a designated town area where PvP is ALWAYS off. That way people could make attractive bases to show off and do some real trading. Oh and also fix as many bugs as they can and stop f\*cking the balance towards tedium.
---
Cool.
---
I am replying to the person that do “come here” emote and shoot at the bag. 
---
And I joke that I interpret it as what I replied to him. 
---
Well let me pose an allegory. If there's a bakery that lost half their customers when they switched over to a bran based muffin, do they continue to make bran muffins and attempt to improve the bran muffin recipe or throw out the entire model and try to make regular flour muffins again at great cost?
---
Bethesda knew from the get go this would be a very different, outside the comfort zone experience for everyone, including themselves. They knew some people just weren't going to like it. There's no way to go back and make Fallout 76 an offline Fallout 4 spin off. They can't win back the people that hate bran muffins, all they can do is improve the recipe for people that like both. 
---
Cool, thanks for stopping by.
---
Calibrated Receiver or Tweaked Automatic Reciever, Armor Piercing Magazine, Tank Killer, and all the Sneak/Crit/VATS perks.
---
400 hours, bloodied sniper build, and I roughly ever use PA. I play loads of pvp and win most of my engagements. I never saw the need for a PA.
---
I use a stealth build and maxed out ironclad. Fire proof and the stealth perks. It isn't ideal damage resistance, but stealth builds do not take much hits to begin with.
---
I solo the nuke silos with 40% health for the bloodied effects without any problems.
---
These are scorched beast lures. Used in some of the events that spawn in the cranberry bog.
---
Typically you activate the lure using the switch and are takes with killing a scorch beast. They generally force them to land so it is balanced for melee builds.
---
A behemoth robot from Fallout Tactics would be dope. 
---
I've gotten bos paint from forbidden knowledge but nothing else
---
I absolutely know they don’t care, yet it won’t stop me from hoping for some type of fix.
---
Same idk why I still play I'll probably stop at level 100
---
When does the switch become active?  
---
I only reached about 70 before I quit, levelling lost its appeal when I stopped getting SPECIAL points as I just kept unlocking things I didn't equip anyway.
---
Thinking about giving it another shot with a new character and new build at some point, but I'll give it a few more patches first.
---
No, no, thank you!
---
Automatic weapons are nerfed into the ground. 
---
See the mg42.
---
13 dmg for the same bullet that does 150 on a sniper rifle. Doing more than a .50cal.
---
Thanks for letting us know
---
Similar problem with mutations and rad worms once it's cured either with a disease cure or by it's self marsupial no longer works.
---
My initial comment may have come off more hostile than I intended, by the way. 
---
I mean, I barely play the game anymore. I still want to vent my frustrations, and I still hope Bethesda will listen and fix the problems. Sure, some folks are negative just to be negative, but that's not all of them. 
---
Is Furious still bugged or has it been fixed???
---
I was almost level 103. I still have SO much left to do, too. I'm pulling my hair out over this shit. $60 for a game that is (for me) 10% bugs and crashes. 
---
It takes more effort to unsub, lmfao. It's literally one click, which is far less effort than these rants of yours have been. 
---
You're real upset about all this son. I'll see you in the next great salty 76 post so you can continue to bitch about a game that clearly hurt you deeply and continues to tear at your bum soul. 
---
Now type out an uber salty response that's *still* going to be more effort than hitting unsub, lmao
---
Do you feel better? Coming here and shitting on someone venting at the end of their rope with a game that's fun? 
---
I don’t think so
---
I... actually haven't stumbled upon one of those, so I'm curious too. Where'd you see that one? 
---
There are relay towers that you can pop government holotapes into, for supply drops, but that's not one of them. In the cranberry bog areas, you're asked to align some satellites, but that doesn't look like one of them either. 
---
&gt;Stash size was increased from a ridiculously tiny size to a slightly less tiny size, it's still nowhere near large enough.
---
That's completely arbitrary and you know it. The stash size is more than large enough to store every good weapon and apparel you find  that you can't use at the moment (as long as you don't want duplicates), and still have enough room left over for hundreds of pounds of junk and aid items. Every fallout game has inventory management, if you're running out of space just bulk up some of that junk that you rarely use and sell it along with the legendaries that aren't as good as the ones in your main load out. People will complain that it's not large enough regardless of how big they make it, right now it's in a good place for most people.
---
&gt;Duping was fixed and then broken again by patch 5.
---
Prove it then. They patched all the main duping methods people were using, capped inventory weight, and removed the ability to stack stuff like bobbleheads. I haven't seen any proof since then that it's still working, just a bunch of unsubstantiated claims and people trying to trick other players into giving them money to do it for them.
---
&gt;You can't even say they've fixed the scorchbeast attack thing as that is "in the future" like everything else.
---
Good thing I used future tense then instead of saying that they'd already fixed it. Not that it was ever a real problem to begin with; running away from scorchbeast fights you don't want to participate 
---
in is easy.
---
&gt;There is no sense of urgency for this and pretending they're fixing things "at a decent rate" is not going to help anyone
---
Pretending they aren't fixing thing at a decent rate doesn't help anyone either. They've addressed every major complaint I've had about it within a few months of me purchasing the game.
---
&gt;Bugs on here have been known since Fallout 4.
---
There's bugs in every game they've ever released, including Fallout 4. The reaction to them is what's changed. None of those bugs are game-breaking.
---
Most people tried so hard to ignore or think they dont hurt the game that much but in reality it really is starting to show.
---
Haven't played since the beta , has much changed since then ?
---
Thanks! Still a few levels short of Incisor. Do you know if the different armor piercing effects (weighted arms, Incisor, Bastet) stack?
---
I’ve see. Then in the CB and the ash heap
---
As salty as the ocean :)
---
Anyhow I read your post as /s
---
Lol, you didn't address a single point of mine.  Your "analysis" of the game is as pathetic as your argumentative skills.
---
There are plenty of valid reasons to criticise this game, but you listed none of them, and you were unable to do anything but use an ad hominem attack.
---
Your post is recycled garbage.  Good day.
---
He got sidetracked looking for picnic baskets over by dolly sodds 
---
And if you send some high level folks a team-up request while you're inside a silo, they'll probably get the hint and accept it. This also protects you somewhat if you get booted - you can join the session of one of those folks. 
---
Yep, they're literally rented from Amazon.
---
I loved the game up until the end game, and I hated that I bought it for 80 bucks and it went on sale the next week for 30
---
Someone’s stacking foundation squares irl, nice
---
Have you restarted the game?
---
I am shitting on you? Okay...
---
Let’s say if you build defenses I think for what I’ve seen enemies will go agro to : water , food and energy.
---
If you keep a little fence ( a square with 1 fence all ways) it will keep crops and stuff “safe”
---
Have you turned it off and on again? 
---
I've never had it work once. Not at all. I am on Xbox one s.  "World no longer exists" or some dumbass message. Early on, I tried it a lot, but was not once successful, so I said fuck it all and just stopped trying. 
---
I actually had a mission come up in the corner of my screen a while back. "Get the supply drop" it said. So I did. Instant wanted status. What the heck?
---
Scrap weapons until you get it ( combat rifle )
---
?
---
That’s one fucked up lookin transformer
---
You came in here, made a sarcastic post and then downvoted my shit. Cool! Feel better!
---
I've had that happen to me at WhiteSprings. 
---
I haven't played since the ammo spawn nerf.
---
 So
---
Your flair indicates Raider. I can respect that.
---
Its the worst thing they absolutely didn't have to write into a Fallout game of all things. Yea thats the story but its tanking the game.
---
And they called people who called this game ''unfinished'' a hater... Now you understand why. I love fallout but this game is just boring. It was doing the same thing over and over, kill,loot and return. I had no communication with other people because they had no mic or they just walked their own path. I quit this game a month ago. But go ahead and down vote it. 
---
What are these used for ?
---
restarted the game, restarted the ps4, unplugged ps4, restarted router, unplugged router.   
---
Will do! Thanks for caring!
---
Automatic weapons are the most powerful category of weapons in the game. 
---
There is s fissure and pond bottom left corner of map. Best place to nuke for flora.  
---
Ah. I'm too literal. My apologies. 
---
Glad to hear you got in and out of the Vault in one piece.  These Vaults are still under construction, but we look forward to sharing more on how they will become part of the game. In the meantime, we also appreciate when players like yourself let us know about stuff like this. We have shared with the team and will let you know if we have any follow up questions. Thank you!
---
I’ve had that come up for bugs and radtoads.
---
Yeah feel like it’s almost always radtoads though 
---
If he wanted to be around for powering up Poseidon that would’ve been fine. Seemed like that wasn’t going to be it. He needed something more and I just wasn’t trying to be available. I felt bad but it was what it was I guess.

I've had this before. I run immediately , my camps been destroyed like 3 times and I've gotten nuked twice. Plus with all the duping and banning going on I never want to take chances. 
---
Fucking trolls. 
---
Not dead at all (still profitable , still more user on this sub,still more knuckleheads making dumb videos , if items like this makes 8 dollars if let’s say 20,000 suckers purchase it ...
---
Kinda gives you an idea of the low key money they’re making 
---
It’s all FREEEE PUblicity !!!
---
That's not even true. 
---
The Mg42 at launch did 13 damage. 
---
To a level 62 super mutant. 
---
It would take 2 -3 reloads.
---
Where as a bolt action, it would take 3-4 bullets. Vs 180. 
---
In no way shape or form are automatic weapons the most powerful.
---
As a low level, I usually stay away from high levels because of the high level enemies. I dont want to one shot by a level 100 ghoul.
---
I mean they still havnt fixed such basic things that modders have fixed years ago.
---
This was in November.
---
Oh it's fine, it's the internet. You have to be okay with people berserking over anything and saying things with a keyboard they would never say to your face. 
---
I do hope they address issues that people have because I like the unscripted interaction of rando players impacting my game/going rogue and hunting them down. If it was just me and my crew on the map I think I'd be okay with that too, except killing the Queen would be damn near impossible and there'd be a lot less nukes. Considering the amount of time I've logged in to 76 though, I've more than got my money's worth at this point even if they shut down the servers today. I hope others get to that point because I'd like to see more online Fallout/Elder Scrolls action going forward. 
---
They are used as ammo for gatling lasers with a prime receiver. 
---
Servers are all capped so it doesn't really matter as much, radiator for a more solo experience
---
Are those particulary difficult? I'd like to do them but I'm lvl 38.
---
yes, if you played on console, log in the same Beth account you linked, in the launcher on pc
---
LOL
---
Dude same! Although my problem might be because I sprint up to them wearing a faschnacht man mask
---
Yeah they are. They involve scorch beasts 
---
I used to periodically hop over to Vault 76 when I'd see a new player pop up there, and hand them water and .38.  
---
Though I don't remember the last time I've done that. There are *no* new players. 
---
No sir, you want to screw yourself, take several copies of the same treasure map to the spot, and spam the activate button as fast as you can.
---
I’d wait until they patch it which they are suppose to do fairly soon. Right now it can permanently count against your camp budge even if the animal dies.
---
Nope. Tried it. No change. Seems they top at 120% and that's it. 
---
Dense chest mod + fireproof perk makes you immune to explosives.  It really pays to be aware of game mechanics- there’s a lot of perks that reduce damage too (blocker, dodgy, serendipity, lone wanderer), mutations (Empath, if your teammate has it. I run dual clients to store stuff on a mule and I’m about to put Empath on on alt I leave online in team all the time). Power armor chest mod Emergency Protocols is -50% damage, but only kicks in below 20% health and doesn’t work with any “regular” armor effects, so it’s bad in PvP. But it’s amazing in PvE with a Bloodied build if you are heavy weapons, since you want to use power armor. 
---
eh, not that much plastic and not that short of time.
---
I had it remove all my perk card effects for my heavy weapons yesterday on PC after the disease went away. I hopped servers and it was gone after.
---
Idk why but I pictured a sawed off shotgun strapped to a cat
---
&gt;OP doesn't know about the glitch that lets you stack foundations on each other
---
*This wasn't part of the plan*
---
I’d recommend it. Building a new character is fun.
---
Agreed. Although most of the players are already at endgame. We just need new content 
---
The last time I was approached by high level players, I was mugged of my caps after they chased me. I’m just weary of high level players in general now 🤷‍♀️
---
No thanks. I am not into that, but you enjoy!
---
Well over 45 GB seems like a massive game in my opinion.
---
Oh i know about that i just dont know how to do it
---
Yeah I'll just get violated attempting that at this stage lol
---
Had 2 players come up and say they wanted to help me and then both took turns trying to kill me :/ was not fun. 
---
I'm a console player,but ty anyhow.
---
In the ash heap, a huge four legged robot strikebreaker. It's regular attacks are assaultron head laser strength, and it calls in swarms of Sgt Gutsies. 
---
In the forest, a massive ant. Fast and agile with a status attack bite that causes other players to appear as enemy creatures. It summons regular giant ants, and other high level insects.
---
Whitespring should have that giant map snake spawn. 70 feet long with poison attacks.
---
In the savage divide, a giant three headed snallygaster. Call it Cerberus.
---
This is essentially the cool dynamic most folks seem to be missing about FO76. It feels more like real desperation when you have no idea how a real person will react to you.
---
I had a buddy try and kill a slightly lower level dude who was wait long on his camp. “Dude that’s lame, and also, he might have a higher level friend...” -Literally 2 minutes later a super high level dude obliterated us. Over and over.
---
Appalachia is a dangerous place.
---
Watch you back out there survivors!
---
That’s really cool
---
yes, sorry if I wrote it strangly. I am a xbox player. On pc, download the launcher and log in your Beth account (same on linked to your console copy)
---
I was hanging out around the Overseer's Camp with my sister who just started and some dude rolled up, clearly wary of a level 106 at the second location in the game. Gave him a wave emote, turned my back so it's clear I wasn't about to pop off on him. I'd be wary too.
---
&gt; Edit: to clarify these are usually players that I am running into at random or if I decide to help out defend a workshop - during the workshop I can see why someone might be wary though. I generally approach the player as non-confrontational as possible.
---
That's asking for it. I don't care what level you are, someone shows up at my workshop I'm assuming they're there to steal or try to take it over. Doubly so if you're in PA. 
---
I hear you about a gift emoji though. I like the "Come Hither" emote for bringing people to me. Shitting a bag of goodies and jumping up and down on it, shooting at it usually gets the message across. Trading is too involved for noobs, the menu takes some getting used to.
---
So clever! Are you here all week? Can I have your autograph? 
---
Radworms does affect mutations' effects when that disease heals. Logging out then coming back remedies it.
---
Welcome!
---
I had a thought the other day about a fabled Appalachian Death Worm. A scaled up impossibly armored bloodworm from nukaworld, with an instakill attack if it burrows up under your feet.
---
I’m over 600 hours played and if you asked me a month ago I woulda said “Yes, but...” 
---
Right now though it’s a HARD no. BGS needs to fix their shit
---
(Posted early by accident, sorry). 
---
F76 fused two gaming tribes together. 
---
People who play shooters, battle royale games, CoD/battlefield etc. 
---
And people who play RPGs. 
---
There’s a *huge* philosophical divide between them. Simply put, the first group believe a gun is a gun. You pick it up, add FPS skills, and you’re ready for the toughest battles. You know these people because they cite the weapon’s paper damage when making observations about game balance. 
---
The second group plays RPGs. They build characters, explore game mechanics available, make use of everything they can, including modifying play style, to come up with powerful characters. 
---
Now, The Fallout franchise is, and has always been, an RPG franchise. 
---
So my suggestion to you is put away some of your QoL perks, and see if you can make your LMG hit 3 figures, your 50 cal, handmade, combat rifle or 10mm SMG do 250 per shot with over 50% enemy DR strip down, or get an energy weapon to do 300 per shot. 
---
The game plays very differently that way. 
---
I’m hoping the next patch is good. The last one sucked! Before that one though I thought they were all pretty decent at least in terms of fixing bugs. 
---
Sure, send me your address.
---
It's for Dogmeat!! You know they can't have a Fallout game with the lovable old shoe. I said he's coming when he wasn't in the released game. You watch. 
---
Tell you what, you take an AK47 with iron sights, I'll take a Winchester 700 with scope, we'll set up 300 yards apart and then see who's head explodes first...
---
what about downloading all the update files? 
---
r/captainobvious
---
All I’m saying is that Fallout 76 isn’t just a small project, it’s huge. Like trying to make a sharp turn with a cruise liner. 
---
While this post was a constructive submission to feedback, it’s also a lot of whining.
---
TL;DR every 25 levels after level 50 should give one special point to distribute. You know. For fun.
---
There should be milestone level ups. Every 25 level ups after 50 should give you a special point to distribute. I've played almost every day since the first day of beta and am a legit level 163 on my main character. No xp exploiting or any type of hardcore xp grinding. Just playing normal. I would only have 4 extra special points. That would hardly make me godly. But it would allow for slightly more interesting builds. The only reason I am so high of a level is that one of the dailies is to level up (wish that wasn't a thing). But this would give you something to look forward to after level 50 if you did want to have a very high level character. I don't  see very many characters over 150 anymore so I don't think this would make anyone godly. But I think it would be fun. I have more to add to this idea but I've been drinking and don't feel like typing anymore. Goodbye. 
---
No, no it wasn’t! Bail out! Bail out!!
---
Good to know 
---
Yeah..
---
 In PvP, your DR is pretty meaningless against melee(and to a slightly lesser extent, ranges). They get 75% armor penetration from perks, and a decent melee build can do an easy 500 damage with normal attacks with a super sledge (my damage with Adrenal reaction at about 25% health is over 1k), and a power attack does even more. 
---
It’s all about % damage reductions from armor/perks/mutations, since Anti-Armor and armor-reducing perks don’t affect those. 
---
I’m lvl 80, and naturally assume if someone joins in a defense, they’re going to take the workshop. 
---
My biggest issue is that Bethesda nerfed ammo drop rates for 308.. being in west Virginia, that round is everywhere. 
---
Now tie that into a build based around heavy weapons and you find out that it's absolutely useless to run an Mg42 . 180 rounds vs 5 of the same rounds from a Sniper rifle and all of a sudden you understand how fucked up gunplay is. 
---
Then you think using a .50cal would be better and it's absolutely not. 
---
The scary thing is, given the situation? This might be that far from the truth.. 😢
---
I do the same thing for my front door and had the same issue. 
---
It was meant to be an internal barrier that I happen to like much better as a front gate. You just have to work it the right way. Ever since C.A.M.P.s have been permanent I've never had to reset/replace the keypad door and have had the same entrance keycode. It should only be a problem once. 
---
yes it gives you 5% per card i think the max is 15% and a chance enemies will explode too.
---
My EB Games here only refunds store credit unfortunately 
---
Thanks for input 
---
I'll have to check that out!
---
I have a level 25 lever action rifle with explosive effect that was given to me by another player. It wasn't overpowered one hit kill, but it was a great weapon and I used it all the way up to like, level 45. 
---
So, whoever you were dude, thanks!
---
I'm def going to pass that thing on to a level 25 rifleman player whenever I come across one.
---
Yea, it was unexpected for me too. I'd thought about multiplayer Fallout for awhile-- mainly because I just wanted to play with some family and my best friend, we've all been Fallout players since the original release in the 90s-- but I didn't expect it to happen. And then just when I was getting bored with FO4's map they announced this game. And yea, bugs and all, I'm still enjoying it. Won't last forever but hey, I've already had value for my bucks at 200+ hours played.
---
As far as 76 in public... while it's totally fine to criticize the game, many people-- I would guess most-- who actually smack talk 76 are basically the gamer equivalent of extremists. Something exists that they hate for reasons I'll never comprehend, and they're incapable of just ignoring it and having fun in their own lives. Probably because they lack EQ and self-control. 
---
Plus vindictive, childish people tend to spend a lot of time on the net. Who knew, right? :P
---
Supposed to be an internal barricade, not meant to be your front door. 
---
You just have to get it right once though, ever since permanents C.A.M.P.s I was going from 3-4 new codes and placements a week to never having to do it ever again. 
---
Tbh it’s 30% off right now and it’s still not enough of a discount to combat all of the criticism that’s why I’m looking for redeeming qualities lmao 
---
Thank u friend 
---
Yeah, I just realized how my comment read after I re-read it, lol.
---
I also love the idea of online Fallout, so I'm hoping they actually try to improve. I still log in every now and again, but between work and being a dad, my time with the game is limited already. I just find myself not logging in even when I have the time, you know? 
---
You underestimate Bethesda's incompetence 
---
Yeah I like randos in events but I don't like running with one random for too long.
---
In other online games I join randos for a mission and then drop out of the team as soon as the mission completes. (Warframe, TD1)
---
I like how Apex Legends does it as well but that is a whole different game style.
---
They should, but multiplicative, not additive. So Blade of Bastet -50%, then, say, Incisor is -75% of that, so an enemy would have ~12% armor left. 
---
Everytime this happens to me I jump servers FAST 
---
I wasn't on a mission when this happened to me but I'm glad I'm not the only one. Safe travels friend!!!
---
It's nice getting stuff from high-level players, but sometimes it ruins the fun. Getting a super good weapon or armour plans can make you a little OP and get rid of some of the progression.
---
This happened to me once at the station near Top of the World, but when I fast travelled away it stopped happening...
---
Look for Its a Trap events
---
That’s too bad, if even the future looks bleak! What’s kept you in the game for so long? 
---
I’m no stranger to repetitive content; my most played games of this gen are destiny 1 and 2 
---
I think I have the mothman sleeping bag on my roof (to sleep under the stars of course)
---
Mire Lurks also get stuck under the map, had the Bos stuck under a lake on one Horde shoot, gave up.
---
I see a high level ...I RUN!
---
*cough* Bethesda *cough* 
---
When I got my megasloth I trailed his ass home making he sure he didn’t get killed sorry to hear about your bear I know how annoying they are to spawn :( took me like 2 hours for a sloth
---
..... did you try Eating or drinking?
---
Control room half way done. Come on down 
---
Calzadore's are of the wasp family anyway. Of course, they could always soup up the bees!
---
I too have all riflemen (9) and bloody mess perk cards, but at full health, my base lever action only has 172 damage compared to your 392 with explosive.  Even with the added 20% for explosive, I should only be at 207 damage at full health.
---
Highly recommend Contractor. Halving your requirements for setting up shop means you hardly spent any of your own resources gaining them. Another key is a Fusion Generator. It completely erases the need for like six large generators and saves you a shit ton of material. The only caveat is the nuclear material which can be a pain sometimes but it still plentiful if you know where to look. 
---
If you're not fully maxing out a workshop's budget (and you really never should unless you're expecting hostile players) you can get by easily without spending too much. 
---
Haha been playing Apex lately and it literally crashed FOUR TIMES IN A ROW when I tried to open my inventory. Like, entire PlayStation froze up and had to hard reset type of crash. I still play it. 
---
What are some ways it’s great? 
---
best thing to do is get them agro and make them follow you back to your Concrete Bunker base "unbreakable".
---
Climb inside and wait for them to come and get pissed that they cant get to you.
---
Then when they get a bounty fast travel out and Kill them ;) :0.
---
Soo much fun doing this lately
---
Sounds like you took that wedding scenario from experience. You alright there buddy?
---
Thank you! I'm very happy with how it turned out! 
---
Yep, I gotcha. Just making a cap run with materials ready to sell is itself a time consuming experience, plus you've gotta look through the legendary stocks in Watoga in case some assclown did something stupid like selling an Anti-Armor Handmade (oh please god please). 
---
Christ, people really get pissy when you voice a different opinion 
---
this happened to a guy a few weeks back when he was trying to do the mole rat horde.
---
He fast travelled there and becuase the enemy was inside vault 63 he spawned in there to do the event.
---
so dont stress about glitching in as its not your fault.
---
I average close to 20 players on almost every server I enter. Jumped in yesterday and ended up on a server with like 3 players, which was kind of weird feeling, then on my next hop ended up on one with about 18.
---
Sounds like you hit a string of bad luck. Even if the player base was shrinking though, we wouldn't notice because Bethesda would just be consolidating servers to keep concurrency reasonable for reach realm. This isn't an MMO like WoW where you can easily see high population dip over time due to the static nature of character-server affiliation.
---
Looks like the old TNT area outside Pt. Pleasant. Good stuff. 
---
nope and nope. I'm a low level and i stay well away from high level players. and I never take anything from anyone... how many time have I been shot in the head while looking a lot bag... 
---
reminds me if the phrase " friendly, friendly..." in any pvp
---
You are correct 
---
He didn’t have a really powerful weapon, slap damage ( the “pre PvP” damage) caps at about 5 health per hit. Since your normal health is about 200, give or take, he can still kill you with 40 bullets. Lots of time for you to heal with stims, or simply log off
---
Compared to full PVP where he could potentially 1shot you, it’s a huge difference. 
---
I see LadyDevann has already jumped in with your answer :) Seconding what she said!
---
lmao
---
Read my sister post please. 
---
I apologize for accidentally hitting send early, it came off condescending that way. I didn’t intend that, so I deleted and reposted. 
---
It is true. I’m trying to help you,  or argue with you. 
---
One sec, I’ll grab a couple of links (to stuff I’ve been listing here) and refer you. 
---
We’ll make a gunner if you get :)
---
It's a mistake. People were complaining that crafting wouldn't automatically scrap bulk junk when their regular junk ran out, so they removed the flag that protected it. That caused scrap-all to break it down too.
---
It ought to have its own third category, auto-scrapped when you run out of regular junk, but not when you scrap-all.
---
Scp has escaped 
---
Ok so?
---
This doesnt change the fact that a fully perked maxed handmade does the same as a normal sniper rifle. I use both sniper and handmade in long and short range.
---
Guess, I am going to have to track the next one I catch.
---
Happened to me also outside the wendingo cave
---
Not gonna lie, that first photo is one the greatest I've ever seen posted to this sub. 
---
I WISH I saw a welcoming committee like that when I started. You're doing ~~God's~~ ~~Mother Kos'~~ Todd's work, friendo. 
---
I know right. Like all I said was the beta is trash and the game now is meh and it has so many bad reviews that I don't bother with it and people just flip their shit because of it
---
Never doubt it
---
You are right, only at 50% or plus discount, and if you really like fallout
---
Im just gunna say thanks. To you and the people that do this. My friend was reserved about the game, we had both come from Sea of Thieves.. so we expected a whole lot of PVP and losing our junk on supply runs. And the thing that keeps us coming back to fallout 76 is this kinda beheivour. The fact that almost everyone is totally cool. 
---
Ive never recieved a legendary i can use, but i appreciate the boost in caps when i needed them. And all the aid items people gave me helped a lot. My friend is the same too and always says how nice people are in the game.  Ive been stuck by missions im not high enough level to solo too and a few invites later theres always some kind stranger willing to lend a hand. 
---
So thank you to you. And the other people doing the same. Even though im like.. level 55 now, i find myself always trying to help out low levels with an abundance of stimpacks/chems/crafted armor to their level/bobbleheads i dont need on my build. Your generosity made me generous too.. and im usually a right old miserable bastard online. 
---
I was expecting an FO4 or FNV or Skyrim volume of content for $60. I got a lot less. I still had fun and whatnot, but fo76 has dramatically reduced the bar of expectation and will make me think twice about another Beth title.
---
You can get better gaming value for that price point with other titles simply put.
---
Mr. Handy Buzzblade
---
Yeah, I finally saved enough caps to buy it, and made like 10 of them! Somewhere along the way I must have found the plans for the Prime Automatic Receiver mod. Just need to figure out how to get that pure flux now.
---
Looking for help to earn field medic. Last trophy so can hook up with caps and weapons after I get it.
---
The point is that it looks stupid because the keypad is on the drywall side instead of the brick side. Not that its impossible to flip it around.
---
Thank you!!! I'll check it out! And now I understand the water... as you said, there's a pool on the roof, so that explains it.
---
I'd love to hear your thoughts, yes! I don't mind at all looking at the files. I'd do it myself if I knew how!
---
I'm cataloguing every location in F4 and F76 with the faces. Today I found the asset names and even the original art (in that book "Art of Fallout 4"). Did you look for the "Metro Man Statue"? That's the one I'm most interested. However, now I'm inclined to think that there's not much to it. I'm going to catalogue everything, anyway!
---
"DontWorryAboutThis"... yeah, right!!! hahah My obsessive mind WILL worry about this, Mr. Developer! =]]] Let's be honest, this is the coolest part of the game and we all want more!
---
The handmade is another one that irks me. They finally "fixed" the plan availability, and then tripled(?) the price. Last time I played, I basically just cleaned out 3 faction vendors, on top of the caps that I had, and I still don't have enough. 
---
Oh well.
---
You know what's odd now that you say that? I have seen his mutant ass in weeks. Like I'm on for hours at a time with multiple people in my party and he's nowhere to be found. Did they change his route or something? 
---
Haha   i know.  You have to work at it 
---
I did read. 
---
But nothing is even correct unless you can properly pull out a Datamine from within the game to prove that it does more damage .
---
The silence and lack of meaningful forward progress from Bethesda tells the entire story.
---
FO76 is an absolute disaster and there is no reason to think anyone is interested in saving it.
---
Yeah no power armor but definitely understand in the work shop situation. 
---
Came in expecting a post about how to gain massive amounts of screws, left massively disappointed. 
---
Don't mention screws or screwing unless you're ready to give me some of those little threaded gold nuggets OP.
---
Good to know lol.   Actually only had one little bounty over 140 levels.    Also, lots of people have chat turned off.
---
Very true. I always try to stay outside the general workshop area no weapon drawn. Way away from the red terminal. 
---
Have you tried uninstalling the game? That should fix the problem.
---
I almost always team up on Nuke Zones, it's led to some really great moments and new friends. 
---
I've been playing on my mule character because my main character levels up to fast and I can't level him up because I would be to high level to play with my friend.
---
Anyways my mule is about level 19 right now and I've actually been dropping food/drinks for other people because I craft a lot of food and drinks...too much for me to actually use up before they go bad. I try to drop them for people but they don't notice...I really wish there was a gift emote.
---
Like this one guy he was level 80 something? I had just finished defending the farm workshop from mole rats when I noticed that someone had killed some mole rats for me. I ran over and sure enough there was a nearby camp. It was locked up so I stood near the door and waved at him. Guy let me in and I looked around his place, gave him the thumbs up because it was a cool camp, used his rad shower and dropped him a beer. I waved and then ran off. idk if he saw I dropped him a beer, but it was my thank you for helping me, letting me in your camp and letting me take a rad shower.
---
I've also been dropping plans for people too when I have them, since I'm plan farming.
---
Also anybody who's higher level then me that comes over to my workshop? Yeah I don't trust you...no matter how many friendly emotes you use.
---
That level 80 was different...he didn't run up to me...he stayed in his camp and shot at the mole rats that spawned near his camp.
---
My heart hurts from reading that, because I know something bad did happen, but what does that do when you slam the buttons?
---
i already did
---
The Gauss Wiki is one of the more filled out ones:
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Gauss\_rifle\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Gauss_rifle_(Fallout_76))
---
Thanks whoever datamined or figured out the info!
---
Why don't you idiots do something about the random server disconnects during a nuke run? All of that time wasted, and you morons can't seem to keep your own crap running. 
---
The number you’re after isn’t in the game files. 
---
It’s a paper damage from the game files (say, 30 damage per hit) multiplied by a whole bunch of multipliers that apply to your character, to
---
Arrive at 250 DPH for a handmade, or newly 500dph for a gatling. 
---
The DPH figure is calculate on hit, it doesn’t live in the game files. 
---
I always try to just give basics. Maybe a few drinks packs. Dog food. Nuka Colas. Generally 1-3 of each. Nothing huge. Just a little pick me up. As I feel very much the same way as you. 
---
It's both lag and a bug with getting into and out of Power Armor and how that affects weight.  Sometimes it works to your benefit.  This morning, I fast traveled because for a moment, the game thought 285/270 wasn't overweight. XD
---
The never ending dumpster fire that is F076
---
Thanks for the advice, i won't waste any perk points in it. I'm working towards a min/max build with 15 points in each of PER, AGI and LCK and very much embracing the glass cannon mentality, so i'm happy with my 9/9 in rifle perks. It's surprisingly good fun, just need to find a decent legendary weapon now.
---
HOW are people still complaining about the two shot nerf???
---
I used to roll around with a TSE handmade that was doing a ridiculous amount of damage ONLY using demolition expert with NO commando perks and it was doing close to 300 damage. Needless to say I gave the gun to my girlfriend who is completely new to FPS games so she could actually roll around and learn how to shoot without getting destroyed by everything and I switched to my ONE star AA Handmade and having adrenal reaction brings my damage to over 100 at 80% health and up to 144 at less then 25% health and i'm DESTROYING mobs still at level 210. And of course your non legendary hunting rifle does more damage than your handmade in writing, are you dumb? Your handmade is ridiculously more effective because why? Maybe its because by the time your hunting rifle popped off one shot and loaded the next bullet your handmade has already fired 10 rounds, quadrupling the damage your rifle has done. What the fuck is wrong with everyone on this sub? End rant and unsubed, In the words of the late great Kenny Powers, kiss my ass and suck my dick, everyone. 
---
I would love to see indestructible Player Vendor terminals all in one central location.
---
Two Reasons:
---
1.  It will be super easy and fun to shop ALL of the Player Vendor Terminals in one central location.  You can even server hop to see everyone's shop in that new server.  Super easy, fast, fun trades.
---
2.  Player vending at camps will be a disaster.  There are already people having problems with other people blowing up their bases.  Now increase that ten times because they show up and didn't like your prices, your selection, or just decided "nope, no selling for you today".
---
Actually I was wondering about this and I have all relevants perks/mods unlocked for just about every ballistic gun. 
---
Are you 100% sure you can see a dip in armor from the Awareness perk? I will most definitely test when I get home because some idiot sold an Anti-Armor Assault Rifle to a Watoga vendor and I'm keen to see if it outdamages my Vampire Handmade. 
---
So would that be a nerf or a buff?
---
It's a fuck up introduced with the last patch but just so you know, in case you didn't, the only materials that weigh less when bulked are aluminum and lead. Everything else is the same weight bulked and unbulked. 
---
CAMP building and Workshops are great. You can build your own CAMP and collect plans to build stuff in it. You can claim workshops and extract resources from them, and build defenses against enemy AI and other players. There are a lot of great ways you can build your character with perk cards to suit your playstyle and weapon('s) of choice. 
---
There are a lot of nice clothes in the game you can collect or find to make your character a little different from everyone else, though not always, like when you walk in a bar and somebody is wearing the same outfit, dress, shirt, etc. hehe. Power Armor is pretty cool and you can get different skins so usually people don't all look the same wearing PA either. Though legendary armor is better in a lot of ways. 
---
The loot system isn't great and getting the exact legendary items you want isn't something you can really grind for as it's all completely random. You can probably find a player selling though, and they are going to introduce player vending apparently at some point. 
---
The story, holotapes, voice acting, etc. is great. The landscapes, details etc. are great. The maps, levels, enemies, etc. everything is well done. Stash space is too small though, so if you like to hoard you'e going to have a bad time. But yeah, thee's so much to see and do and explore etc. You can easily spend hundreds of hours in the game, and if it runs well for most of that time it's great.
---
You can't message people on PC without a mod. *Insane* oversight by Bethesda.
---
Nah just one rabbit that has 2x health that SBQ has but it also does zero damage and is stupidly annoying to hit outside of vats. I think that fits the game quite well
---
Just commented in another post, supposedly you can see the resistance drop in Awareness. 
---
I have Anti-Armor Gauss, Assault Rifle and a Vampire Handmade with all mods unlocked for all of them, along with Tank Killer and Awareness. When I get home I will do some testing on mobs and if my friend logs in I'll be shooting him too. 
---
Guess you haven't heard about people being banned for crafting too much 
---
Maybe there were two different T-51 prototypes tested during its development (A and B). After trial testing the the B model was selected for mass production. 
---
I find it strange I'm unable to complete the belly of the beast quest because servers crash before I reach the end. I have tried like \~10-12 times now and I think it's time I install Civilization 6 back again... and skyrim.. and fallout 4...
---
Ohhhh got ya.
---
It was already updated
---
I got disconnected during a bombing. Couldn’t get the loot I’d left to load, and couldn’t get enough scorched flora to make anything with. Waste of bullets and time. 
---
Cue a Settlement update that has us claiming settlements purely for building and farming purposes kinda like workshops but bigger build budgets and a lot more resource spots.
---
What if our goal is to burn the game to the ground to expose the horrible faults, then shouldnt we kill all mew players make them quit early
---
I just wish Plans would carry between characters.  That would make a subsequent playthrough kind of interesting, because you'd have access to stuff you wouldn't normally have.
---
I’m going to respectfully choose not to imagine that 
---
Gotta admit, I was really psyched to see it along with all of the other newly available plans and bankrupted myself from about 5k caps. I'd pretty much given up on ever seeing the plan (no way I was making a sub level 40 character just for one plan) so I may have gone a little overboard on buying things. 
---
I keep a very strict workshop regimen so I have oodles of scrap to sell directly to vendors. If you want some cap making tips PM me, I ain't posting that to the public. 
---
Aw poor fellow didn't need to run, pvp is locked until level 5.
---
Are you eating and drinking?
---
That's what I was thinking.. But you can't fast travel if hungry/thirsty
---
Yea that is why it took me so long to make a new character. I have a bunch of cool stuff I can make on my high level and now I have to start over with everything except the camp stuff on got on the atom store. They should at least find a way to transfer the stuff between the characters without having to have a second account or a friend help. 
---
&gt;FO76 should really be trying to focus on what sets it apart from other games instead of trying to copy them but worse. They should go full in on persistent player-made communities where each player gets a plot in a designated town area where PvP is ALWAYS off. That way people could make attractive bases to show off and do some real trading. Oh and also fix as many bugs as they can and stop f\*cking the balance towards tedium.
---
Yep.  Bethesda got all glassy-eyed at the $$ FortNite is raking in and went for it - in a half-assed way that no-one wanted or asked for.
---
I would very much appreciate this testing. If possible, could you please post the results. I will also try to test my stinging magazine
---
I usually just murder mobs and sell all their guns. I haven't really traded much with other players. I might log on tonight after the kiddo goes to bed, I should only be about 150 caps shy of the plan cost. I did end up making an alt and got two sets of the handmade plans, but I haven't been able to transfer to my main
---
Even with a headset, people still run away. I've crafted you studded leather and treated flannel shirts! Sometimes you get a cool Assaultron helmet! I just want to make your day better :/
---
My play on fallout 4 all perks unlocked lvl400 and I'm rocking a 10mm, combat shotgun, and sniper rifle
---
I so wanted to live this game because of my love for the series and Bathesda but my tipping point was hit . I don't have to list what's wrong with the game everyone knows. I unfortunately was one of the 60 buck payers for there copy. I played fair I didn't cheat played the game cause I love the immersion and started grinding for a 3star legendary to take on the scorch queen but when level 200 + a hole shows up and clubs everything before I strategically shoot them it really sucks. It breaks my heart that this game is broken. This is my break up note. But seriously Bethesda put some lipstick in the atom shop at least let us look pretty when you fuck us over.....
---
pc gamer picked it up too -&gt; [https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-player-glitches-inside-sealed-vault-63-begs-bethesda-not-to-ban-them](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-player-glitches-inside-sealed-vault-63-begs-bethesda-not-to-ban-them)
---
Yeah, I had a feeeling about the perforating magazine. I’m only using stinging at the moment because it offers a decent magazine size at 35 rounds. Plus I haven’t unlocked the perforating mag yet
---
I mean, having a low level generic weapon deleted for no reason at all is a lot better than the game deleting your perfect god roll.
---
I don't play my main character anymore. not because I'm bored or anything like that, but because I'm afraid to lose my gear.
---
again.
---
That's awesome! And actually it floating there wouldnt bother me like a normal, gravity-defying house would.
---
Thank you for opening my mind!
---
they too eat dog food. I suspect the ones near the cat lady house in Morgantown might be cannibals tho
---
Yeah I'll make a post probably tomorrow with the results and tag you and the other OP about it. Hopefully I can get my buddy on tonight as well as use him as a human test dummy. 
---
I guess it was what the military had stationed in the area at the time the bombs fell.  It makes sense since the B variant was the military standard at the time.
---
Chart,
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser plan is a Cranberry Bog event reward drop only. 
---
They changed spawning of specific items to be player based and not server based. They stated doing it with pa, plans, screws, gears and Springs to keep the jumpers at bay. Really wreaks havoc on the system to server hop so they are making it much less useful
---
They can say thank you or I will slap damage them till they die or server swap.
---
Excellent, thanks. 
---
If you try and access your pipboy before the game fully loads, this tends to happen. I had the same problem. When you load into the world, wait 5-10 seconds before you open your pipboy 
---
This is the truth. I see 2 options: either Bethesda will treat it as if Fallout 76 never even existed due to how much of a failure it was or they will treat it as the black sheep of the family, blaming their first shot at multiplayer as the issue rather than just poor development. But they won't admit that is was just because of their incompetience because that means they admit defeat and that takes their power away.  
---
More than likely they'll just try to sweep it under the rug and use their reputation to justify their next game but it's our job as consumers to speak with our money and let them know that we don't just so easily forgive and forget.... Who am I kidding though Reddit has no idea how to vote with their wallet.
---
Thanks very much. I appreciate that and look forward to the results
---
It seems like it worth to at least grab yourself a frame. Following the main quest and exploring is fun but youll find your self unable to just power through the maun quest. My guy is only level 31 but i just seem to wonder do quests i come across.  Other people are going to give you better advice but just wanted to through this out there. 
---
the game randomly deletes items. this is just another variation of it. absurd that, in a loot-centric game, your weapons can be taken away from you. for no reason at all.
---
people are finally starting to notice it, thankfully. this is by far the worst bug in my opinion.
---
A couple of times i thought I just need to stand back and wait a bit. Lo and behold the gigantic queen corpse vanished before my eyes before I could collect anything. 
---
They get used for my PA too. 
---
20, on my rifleman alt with a 45 1* 2-shot. 
---
Worried about getting banned for Bethesda putting an area in game thats supposed to be inaccessible lol. So glad I didn't pick up this dumpster fire of a game. 
---
Balls. 
---
Welp. This is my life now.
---
Thanks for the heads up, dude.
---
Mine is permanent 
---
That doesn't seem to add up, because I have seen a variety of plans there within the span of an hour of server hopping (the less than 40% of the time there are any plans there) just not the ones I want. 
---
As others have said, it could be Bethesda going back to the older version of how they did PA. It was (until FO4) T51b. FO3 introduced T45d. 
---
I don't remember.
---
Yeah they just don’t work just sell then
---
I've not been experiencing that problem today? Course I only played for like an hour bout 3 hours ago. Might jump on in a bit will have to see for myself.   
---
What system are your on? PC/Xbox/PS4?
---
You are suggesting that automatic weapons do more damage than non automatic. 
---
The faster the gun fires, the less damage it does. That is backed by datamined files. 
---
I can empty more rounds from a Semi automatic AK and do more damage than a Gatling. 
---
There is absolutely no point in running heavy weapons at all. 
---
If what you are saying is anywhere true, The Mg42 would melt enemies in 5-10 bullets. But it comes down to the fact that The Slower the ROF , the more damage. 
---
As seen by Gatling vs Mg42 which has the highest RoF in game. 
---
So ignore all the extra bullshit. 
---
Level 45 LMG does 16 damage. With the same round that does 140ish damage from a weapon that only has a barrel 150 mm longer (based on the GOL Magnum.)
---
Yeah they don’t work just sell them
---
Turns out that   cut from the original release anyway.  Not alot    
---
Yep just sell them they are broken
---
Oh my god I hate cazadores so much...
---
All I can say is METRO IS GONNA ROCK!!!!!!!!!
---
If you shoot down the cargobot you still have to lock pick it, but you don't get the wanted tag.
---
Its the Radworms. Amplifies certain mutations while active and if cured, causes negative effects. Lower jump height and other stuff 
---
&gt;First, arbitrary PVP implemented into the design. 
---
How is it arbitrary? It seems very well thought out to me. Losing junk items, but not guns/armor is perfect. Slap damage instead of full damage at first, then full damage once both parties join in is a great idea. Giving players the choice of hiding their base or building in a public space and risking getting it attacked makes sense, and being able to rebuild everything with the push of a button makes the "risk" minimal. I wouldn't have bought the game if it was like Rust or something. No one can force you into PvP and thanks to slap damage they can't kill you if you're not afk or something.
---
&gt;Second, the lack of any NPCs. 
---
Why are people still lying about this? There's robot NPCs, a whole bunch of new enemy NPCs, and dozens of fleshed out human NPCs that you interact with through their holotapes and journal entries. Why is standing in front of someone listening and watching their animated lips move and arms wave so much better than popping in a holotape and listening to them as you run around playing the game? Other than the animation, the interactions play out exactly the same. "Go here, check this out, find this thing, come back and I'll tell you what to do next."
---
Besides that, they explicitly told you that there would be no human NPCs in the game. Many times. If that was such a deal-breaker for you then you shouldn't have bought it in the first place. Do you also feel mislead because you wanted to play a game set in Boston and found yourself in West Virginia instead?
---
&gt;Third, extremely watered down piss poor story. Previous Fallout games had 1,000 times more NPCs and dialog where this game has no dialogue or NPCs. 
---
Much better story than Fallout 4. The story is about how those 1000s of NPCs got wiped out and what the vault dwellers can do to stop them. Instead of the generic "find this person" quest line that 3, NV, and 4 had, you get that *and* a cool quest about the scorched plague, not to mention all the side quests (Mistress of Mysteries is my favorite so far). The world is bigger and more fleshed out than many Fallout games, every new place has more content packed into it than before, and the quest givers are just as interesting and fun even if they are robots and computers. Again, you were told that that's what you should expect going into the game. 
---
&gt;Radio silence from Bethesda with very little information. 
---
Maybe if you ignore the Inside the Vault updates, regular patch and hotfix notes, and the hundreds of comments from their reddit team. 
---
&gt;No updates about future content
---
I guess I imagined all that discussion of dedicated hardcore PvP servers. Oh sure, you don't count that/forgot that/lied about that because you're not interested in it. So what, you were expecting DLC to start dropping less than 3 months after the game came out? It was over 4 months for Fallout 4 to get DLC. 
---
&gt;just incredibly small changes or fine-tuning that should take a couple days but instead are dragged out for months
---
People say that about every glitch and bug that has ever existed. "Oh, it should just take a few days to patch." You don't know that unless you're a game developer working for Bethesda. Some fixes are a big problem and they take very little time to fix, those are fixed in hotfixes. Other fixes a very minor problems or take a long time to fix, those are fixed in patches. Don't know about you, but I've been getting patches and hotfixes every few weeks. Stash sized=upped. Duping=fixed. TSEs=nerfed. They're cranking them out fixes at exactly the rate I'd expect.
---
&gt;Absolutely nothing from them at all. Just silence.
---
Lie all you want, that doesn't delete their constant updates from the internet. Here's a link, last Inside the Vault was 3 days ago (announcing a fix to two more major complaints people had), starting a discussion on how to make creatures better (that has spawned hundreds of post in this subreddit alone).
---
Of their reddit team, /u/Ladydevann has posted within 2 days ago, /u/LoneVaultWanderer within 1 day, and/ u/jessBethesda ... wow within 35 minutes ago. Such silence!
---
You've played the game for hundreds of hours in less three months, you'll be back when they release the first DLC and you know it. Try something else for a while if you're tired of it. Or feel free to continue to complain about it on reddit instead of playing games you actually enjoy.
---
Why not move on?  Backlog?
---
Xbox has been brutal this weekend 
---
I'd  pay to see some BOOBleheads :)
---
I have used the bobblehead card and it does the job. A little like when you find a code carrier in the wild, you hear a tone and it increases in volume and tempo. Worth having if you have a bonus perk point. 
---
This is only true if the SBQ corpse doesn't disintegrate into an anonymous purple red meat pile on the purple red desert sand somewhere among the other purple red meat piles.
---
I had that problem last week—but it was not Bethesda.   It was damaged  strands in the coax cable leading up to the home gateway.   Once the cable was replaced the problem went away.   I think Bethesda times-outs bad connectivity fairly early.  
---
Yup, you have been. 
---
Says the person using a worn out tired insult response.
---
Try coming up with your own put downs instead of what others have find before you.
---
It has happened to me several times... Invisible, inaudible enemies that haven't generated right... 
---
Oh? What vendor?
---
I feel like if you slap damage someone outside of your party X number of times you should probably just become wanted.
---
Game was fun, but it got old fast at end-game (wut endgame?)
---
I uninstalled it over the weekend to make room for Anthem that's launching in 5 days.
---
GG Fallout 76. Was fun while it lasted.
---
Yeah, I know. I've done nothing but events for a month ....
---
I get that changing cards is annoying. I am on PC and using the Perk Loadout Manager mod so this makes things bearable. 
---
However just making perks passive wouldnt be a solution imho either because levelling is pretty easy in this game. So making perks passive would then just mean some mandatory levels/perks and be done with it. 
---
What i would suggest though is make the lockpick skill a 3 level card so you'd only have to switch one card. What also would help is if the cards at least would stay in the same place and not shuffle around all the time :S
---
Rad rats would be too much for a cat to eat
---
Not sure.  I've seen him at Lewisburg train station and Charleston Fire Dept area this past week.
---
You can find the tomahawk plan in harpers ferry. I've found it in the museum, the building across from there and the arsenal. 
---
The problem with all this is heavy weapon builds are centered around power armor. How do you not use power armor most of the time when your keystone perk requires power armor?
---
Xbox one
---
I would love to see paint options for Ultracite and Excavator armor.
---
One hitting lvl 98 scorched with a hunting rifle while automatics just waste bullets. Imo automatic guns are not worth in 76. Bad CND and ammo waste.
---
It just works.
---
Charleston Landfill has 3 junk deposits.
---
Thanks for this JC!
---
jfc you're a lifesaver
---
Metro Exodus in 5 days? Fuck yes. Finally!
---
I would LOVE to see crash stats divided by platform.  I assume Bethesda has them but I bet there's no way they'd release them, or probably not be even allowed to.  But if one platform crashes 5 times more often than another, wouldn't that be something we'd like to know!
---
It's often accompanied by a slight stagger as you're walking, and your character makes an audible "ouch".
---
I believe it's the game developers invisibly kicking us in the nads.
---
Just based on players replies I've noticed a trend with Xbox having more connection issues then PS4.  Which is rather odd that one system would have so much more problems then another. 
---
Lv 125 and yes have clicked to learn piano anout 5 times now and cant make one made a heap of combat armor to learn bos it came up i moded some gear loged out plan was gone when i loged back in 
---
I prefer solo too. Its a hastle with a group. I wanna fo about it in my own pace. 
---
Considering its been like that the whole time now, they probably have no intent on fixing it.
---
The “I’ll ignore all the bullshit” really captures  the philosophical difference here. 
---
My one star 50 cal spits out 12 rounds a second that do over 200 damage each before adrenaline and tenderizer multipliers. My Gatling, a more kid back weapon, does only 3.5 500DPH rounds per second. My handmade is tweaked for hip fire and I can instakill level68 *mobs* from a distance with it. 
---
I’ll ignore “all the other bullshit” and clean up 30 bloated corpses I gunned down in less than 15 seconds, while you can clean up the five you got In using whatever other method. 
---
Yeah? I haven’t tried to farm harper’s ferry but I’ve definitely explored those areas many times just passing through, hadn’t seen ‘em yet. Good to know though, running supply drops is really annoying. 
---
It became a Meat Pile.

The most fun I have with this game now is helping out lower level players.  I always share what I'm carrying, I always help kill the legendary, it's a lot of fun and I have met a lot of cool people.
---
Everyone reacts so strongly to everything they say that their lawyers have probably advised them not to say anything they're not 100% sure they can deliver on time.
---
You could just say that some people like to min/max until everything’s broken.
---
Everything, really!
---
Thank you for the write up. This is what I was looking for when I made my post. In a subreddit of 170,000 players, seems like you’re the only one who has anything good to say about it. 
---
That’s why I’m looking for reasons to play; I just refuse to believe that there is so many players still playing the game if it’s as bad as people say. I wanted to hear why those who enjoy the game continue to play. So yeah, thanks.
---
lmao...what a blast
---
It happens on me too sometimes (PC).
---
Actually, if you exit the vendor and then trade again,  their list WILL include the items you just sold and you can buy them back, albeit at 10x the cost
---
It just works
---
Glad somebody finally narrowed it down. I've had this. This is the kind of priority bug that needs patching, not continuous weapon nerfs.
---
I would assume it's because the letter affix system 4 had was traded out for the level system.
---
That's what I thought as well...I put another point into master slugger (had to level to move a point) and it seemed to make a difference.
---
Additionally, someone else here indicated I might be moving to slow, so I took some more damage, extra stims, and moved as quick as I could through the key card part. Still got hammered but not near as bad. By the time I got to the launch room...I was in better shape.
---
Kinda anti climactic at this point lol. But I dropped a nuke on fissure prime.  Hooked up with 5 other players and we didnt make a dent in the SBQ.
---
But I finally got through it 
---
Thanks for everyone's help.
---
And how about make optional CO-OP, like with what that Skyrim mod did?
---
Thanks for not being the JERK who pops out a minigun because I had your camping spot and starts shooting wildly around and the turns an points at my camp. It's nice to hear nice people help out instead of LAME dorks that should go get a life. If you need your CAMP that bad, disconnect or just use your friends or the closest Red Rocket! I don't run from higher ups and I don't give JERKs my time as well.
---
I like the mire and forest areas the most but it just costs a lot of caps to travel. I just settled in the savage divide....
---
Also there is an awesome underground bunker in the north east corner of the mire that makes an awesome camp.
---
It adds to the realism of the game, they can die of old age and fall on you.
---
I started like you only with those 2-3 but then i've gone all in, and got myself Class Freak and all mutations, i feel like a GoD! All those stats, the extra exp from INT, the AP refresh speed, and other stuff its very good not to have.
---
Later in the game, with ammosmith, super duper 3 and going for weapons/ammo types that craft in high quantities (coupled to carrying a gun or two that make use of common found ammo) means once in not very often you’ll bulk a few thousand amp and this largely becomes a non-issue. The extra effort is worth the highly increased combat performance.
---
No it wouldn't. That's still unacceptable pricing. Don't let the bar move.
---
there is literally dlc coming in the coming months , the game has been out for 4 months or something so of course dlc will not be out right now.
---
Ahhh puns. 😊
---
Unfortunately my daydream did not include co-op sorry. No online at all, maybe mods like FO4 but no online.
---
I've seen him come into the Landfill and I take that workshop over just about every time I play.
---
Dude just ghosted me and I know he's got some juicy plans these days. 
---
You sure you aren't looking at your HP?
---
You can't get murdered right out of the vault
---
LOL What a battle cry!
---
So you dont become superman
---
Lol rants? I'm responding to an idiot. If I'm ranting you are ranting. Butthurt kid.
---
And I'm on mobile. Not one click. The whole point was that I didnt even realize I was still subbed. Logic is really hard for you man.
---
Pretty spot on.  Shit like this is why I'm done with Bethesda and similar things from other publishers/developers.  
---
I'm done with 4A Games/Deep Silver because of Epic's exclusivity buy in, done with Epic for the same and more.  EA/Bioware lost tons of faith for roughly the same reason as Bethesda (similar circumstances too, new satellite studio fumbles there first full game based on major IP).  
---
EA's mishandling of the Star Wars IP (all these years and only two controversial SWBF rehashes and several promising cancelled titles) has me done with anything they'll publish.  Worst part is tons of the games look great (RAGE 2, Eternal DOOM, Anthem, Metro Exodus, etc) but I can't support shitty behavior and bad practices.  
---
Tons of their old games I already have are still great though, so I'll just play those more.
---
Smelt them at any chemistry station (you'll need acid).
---
I too am enjoying it still. 👍
---
I sit on the benches til people are done.   Take a number.....

Game stability sadly has gone down the toilet in recent days...  
---
Only 2 days ago, my game completely broke while in the Watoga Emergency Management Building, shortly after listening to the cat in tree holotape.  After a freeze, I was stuck in the respawn point there, unable to move, equip anything, and would be hit with constant damage ever few seconds, like from a phantom/ghost/disease. Restarting game thrice didn't fix, resetting system also didn't fix.  
---
Bethesda support gave me the main 3 options for fix - hard Xb1 reset, deleted XB1 saved data, or worst case - uninstall/reinstall game. The third worked, thankfully. And initially... game was super fast with next to no lag, or no issues... within an hour, the freezing, crashing, disconnection from server (by the way Bethesda... if one is in a NUKE ZONE... why do they not go back to THAT server? Should be priority for that!)... I can barely get 20 mins gameplay without having to reset game or system... it's bloody maddening, and especially while trying to complete Mayor For a Day... I only managed to make it to the roof once, and seemed to have whether a glitch or a set insane attack... not just robot security, but countless scporched, and a scorchbeast attack from air... while on rooftop and triggering alarm for computer reset from the tower. Only ONCE have I made it to the roof, without a error.  
---
New errors include the game freezing when I attempt to get into PA/out of PA, the pipboy being blank black and not letting me exit, or the last one... being completely froze in spot &amp; unable to do anything whatsoever but look at the map.  
---
What is going on with this game??? And by the way... bulked scrap STILL does scrap, when one selects scrap all.. that was not fixed as 'inside the vault' claims... I'm starting to wonder about my sanity, and if I'm a gluton for punishment, byt keep fighting my way through this madness, and still playing this glitchfest that has become on 76 :(
---
Why would they run? There's basically no pvp unless you agree to it
---
&gt;  But, I’m right, right? The game is bad
---
No.  You don't like the game -- that is a defensible position.
---
&gt; Even if people like it.
---
See?  Some people think it's bad, some don't.  So if you say, "the game is bad" you're saying "those people are wrong".  You can't do that without evidence.
---
"I don't like the game" is, like, your *opinion*, man.  It's a reasonable thing to say.
---
Super mutant suiciders are getting smart nowadays
---
I got 2 in one shot after playing 360 hours
---
After my camp got nuked like 3-4 times I went off the reservation - literally.  I’m not close to anything but centrally located to allow me to shuttle back and forth to the stations.   No one has messed with me since.  
---
Odd that the food chain goes Rad Ant &gt; Rad Rat &gt; Cat
---
Poison damage. Hit the stim several times and even then you might not make it. So I was in Whitespring walking the houses and there was a legendary radscorp that spawned under Sewing store floor. I locked on it with VATS and my melee attack brought me under the floor. I tried desperately but died down there. Bag unreachable. RIP loot. Poison damage is powerful. 
---
That sounds...tactical, lemme just note that down real quick
---
Oh-so-useful comment, Negative Nancy.  /s
---
That's the whole reason it's flair'd as a suggestion.  Read the inside the vault blogs.  They read these suggestions.  That doesn't mean they are going to do shit about most of them or even that they prioritize what we feel is important.  But, if we don't ask for it, we won't get it.
---
I can stand next to a car and make it explode without a scratch, I have 600 DR and ER, but a crappy single mine can kill me with some constant drain damage.
---
What  I said.  Testing is *hard*.
---
Admittedly, Austin don't seem to be very good at it, but all the people with no experience claiming it'd *easy* piss me off. 
---
Shit, ah... Are we not supposed to do that?
---
Start a new character with a build totally different then your main. And build camps in areas I didn’t go to much. That’s what I do to keep the game fresh. 
---
Attack of the radioactive Mothmen!
---
Goeff?
---
no clue on the atomic shop generators, but if you're on PC, I'll stop by and build you one.
---
So he's not being banned? Great! :)
---
Agreed, OP.  Tired of manually swapping out 99/100 cores for 12/100's to free up my inventory.
---
This seems like a common sense change to me.
---
It’s just a skin. 
---
No. Just no. Remember when Microtransactions were never more than 5 dollars? Remember when cosmetics were things you EARNED? Remember when games were self contained, complete experiences that worked? You've become used to what gaming is now, but that's not what it should be and it's not okay.
---
Ps4 unfortunately, but thanks a ton for the offer
---
Atomic shop is just the skin
---
This was what I was going to say.
---
Thank you, just saved me from a ton of frustration
---
Right? Thinking.
---
The most expensive edition came with a physical helmet.
---
No problem. If you want generator plans, I recommend claiming any of the nuclear power stations. The reward for capping them or defending them is usually a generator plan
---
Look at Bethesda Austin’s last project and then look at the Atom Shop content and their emphasis on PvP with the new “Survival” mode. They’re chewing hard on that Fortnite schtick and I wish they’d stop. 
---
You could replace FO76 in the title with literally any game that shares the same formula for the last ten years. No shared world looter shooter comes with a fully robust and complete “end game” experience right out of the box, it typically takes months to a year for the crowd that puts over 30+ hours a week into a game to be happy with high tier activities.
---
I think it's the real thing. I'm not positive. 
---
They add +50 carry weight to each leg of the PA. Best PA mod by far
---
I was gonna offer you 5k for the signs and letters when I saw your post a couple days ago but saw you shoot someone down (I think for 2k) and I was only 500 caps off buying from vendor with Hard Bargain 3/Chr 6. picked them up today but I will definitely hit you up for serum later if you're around (I'm in EST timezone) 
---
Can place wood stairs anywhere but the ground unless im an idiot (i hope im wromg) and half WIDTH walls not half hight
---
Message me your ps4 id. 
---
I may have an extra. 
---
You are not wrong, after reading some of the comments and thinking about this two shot did deserve a nerf, however I still think it was nerfed a bit too hard.
---
If you're open to it, I'd buy that from you, I'm on PC. IGN = The_zimmers
---
Scrap your ass off. Ammo for higher level guns is hard to come by. Super duper perk cars is essential for crafting. Dont save anything in your stash you absolutely dont need. (Weapons,armor, etc.) Sell as much legendarys, aid and excess scrap to vendors as you can. Something ive done is establish a "scrap lap." I run to areas around my camp and scrap everything essential before i do anything else so i can craft ammo. If you want to make a special build is essential, otherwise youll have to build a character that can pretty much use any weapon. Idk there is a lot of early game stuff thats different than FO4
---
Hmm, might have to adopt this tactic.  Both actually...
---
Well shit game and shit devs what do you expect? lol 
---
Why not? They get a debuff when not being able to pay their caps 
---
But you are using weapons that do more damage than the Mg42. Which is showing absolutely nothing other than that. Proving the point that Guns with a Slow rate of Fire Do more damage than guns with a high rate of Fire. 
---
You simply do not understand. 
---
Maybe because you need help. 
---
Take a level 45 Sniper max it out. 
---
Take a level 45 MG42. 
---
 WITH YOUR LOGIC, YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY THAT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS are in fact the strongest in the game. 
---
But that is indeed a Lie when Shot damage ON THE SAME ROUND is a difference of almost 130 
---
IF automatic weapons were the strongest, then The Mg42 would kill with the same amount of bullets it takes a sniper rifle to kill which is 5.
---
I just build my first camp and it’s so primitive!
---
We'll all miss you buddy
---
Rifleman build, shotgun build and melee build are most popular. 
---
I thought the chainsaw caps at 20.
---
Of all the things they could fix, this will never be their priority - but it would be great!!!
---
So? With TSE’s being a thing the buff doesn’t really do a lot. And I hate so much to have to kill someone that starts to destroy my camp and get no reward. 
---
Sure, is 2500/leg ok? Also, these are from my old set, so these are premodded legs, not actual mods.
---
&gt; however they didn't fair well against us 
---
Fare.
---
A lot of things seem like they’d be common sense changes with this game. I’m not sure what they were thinking when they made half of the decisions. 
---
Is it just me or does it seem to be more greifing going on since last update? That might be the reason they are running. I might be wrong, but in the past 1-2 weeks or so I've seen more people act like a jerk and grief other players. One day I watched as a Level 60 kept getting wanting levels so others would come find him and try to kill him, so he could kill them. He would also go around the map and find all claimed workbenches, take them over and let them be over runned. He will hold it long enough for the previous owner to give up and leave in anger... then let it go and do the same with the next one. I killed him once for the bounty and he killed me twice (Once before I killed him and once after). I just started ignoring him, so every so often he would randomly appear near me on various parts of the map... only to later on appear on another part of the map to claim someone's camp or harass someone else. 
---
Yeah, it does. Therefore it doesn't go to 45/50 like he said. 
---
Most players start hitting problems at high level because they have no idea what they're supposed to do.
---
There are definitely problems at high level but not nearly as bad as people make them out to be.
---
Example: I've overheard someone claiming they wanted to dupe disease cures because they're so rare...... Spoilers: You can craft them and cranberry bog probably has the easiest one, not to mention the fountain at Whitespring.
---
That would be amazing if the plans carried over. It would encourage people to make new characters because they’d have the advantages of you built with your previous one.
---
yeah i shot em down because i don't sell them for 2k.  ill be online for a couple more hours.
---
You get a debuff and actually go i to mi us caps its very limiting till you can make them back
---
[wipes a tear] It's so...sooo beautiful!
---
Preach brother!
---
Bit much for premade legs, I had thought you had plans or mod for sale. I'll pass, but thanks 
---
&gt;  it doesn't go there way
---
Their.
---
Had this happen on a nuke run. Got out of my power armor to repair my weapons and suddenly died mid repairs. Idk what it is.
---
Yeah it’s like 3 hours. But I hate when someone comes to destroy my camp and gets a bounty and then I kill them and get no reward. 
---
Cool thanks for answering 
---
A good game?
---
I can do 1750, lowest I can go. 3500 for the pair
---
can confirm yesterday afternoon on Xbone I could time my disconnects to a full tour through the legendary farm at Watoga Emergency Services. picked up a few 2/3\* weapons dropping every 6-7 mins 
---
Nope it’s just a skin. The “clean” generator isn’t even that clean. No smoke is emitted from the top like a normal generator, but smoke pours out of the bottom so if you’re placing it on a first floor building, it fills your ground floor with smoke anyway.
---
I think this is due to the lack of content at the moment. People get bored. And out of boredom some turn to griefing other players I'm sure. 
---
A big fear of mine at the moment is that Bethesda has kind of left us dead in the water and our content if we get any is going to be very lackluster. 
---
Comments like this one are cancer.
---
Anti robot and power armor
---
Least they give plans you can't find at the vendors. It's a guaranteed camp plan. You can setup an extractor at your own camp too, lot of places on the map.
---
Thats alot of caps to be able to craft all mutations....
---
Are they max level? Do you recall what your Int. Was when you made them?
---
Fallout 3 was certainly awhiles ago, so my memory's kind of hazy. But I recall prettymuch covering all of it relatively quickly. With most of my hours being eaten up lost in indistinguishable subways that went to indistinguishable ruined city squares.
---
4 certainly does a good job of looking busy, but if you hurl Preston off a cliff along with the other radiant quest stuff, its probably about the same as 76. 76 might even lead by virtue of having actual crafted  content and not a bunch of random-gen nonsense.
---
Not to say that 76 doesn't need an endgame something. It sure as hell does. And no I wouldn't include cutting down the same 30 ghouls for legendary gear you don't even have a use for or the AAA industry's most shoddy broken PvP.
---
Stupid bucket-head! Lol
---
Sending you a PM with a photo.
---
True 
---
Let guess, you dropped the item in that abandoned building over there with only one exit....
---
IT JUST WORKS!!! Welcome to 76. Your stay won't be pleasant at all. 
---
