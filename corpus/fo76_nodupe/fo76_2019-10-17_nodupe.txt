I see it nuked all the time on xbox. are you on PC?
---
---
---
I would totally buy reasonably priced and weighted cans of food from player vending.
---
If you claim a workshop, don’t keep any junk on you.  That way being killed has no effect and you can claim the workshop back after the claim-jumper gets tired and leaves.
---
Saw a 3\* one in a vendor for 6k. It was assassins though, with worst rolls could possibly get. I haven't seen one through 2700 script and have had the plan since the beginning.
---
okay, thanks!
---
and good hunting to you :)
---
I take camps for the xp and rewards, I used to need the resource generators, and may again... for me the trick is to stay crouched at workshops. The PvP players don't know you are at the camp and I have yet to have one come looking if I was not visible on the map (crouched).
---

---
Hope that helps :)
---
Best idea ever
---
The fixer.. Have a 3\* insta fixer I use all the time. Want to replace the tse handmade.
---
Can we also get a gun that shoots cans?
---
Cave crickets, snallygasters and bears. Or just wait for the meltdown vault mission to come into rotation and go farm the engineering wing until your inventory is full.
---
it's not my field, no. but I did help with the DaS bot as a hobby.
---
Wellllll... I posted it on the Bethesda forum now...so hopefully Bethany Esda will see it 😜
---
Oh thank God.   Now if I can only have some more budget to display them all....
---
Learned the plan on day 1 of Encryptid and got a 3 star fixer shortly after the patch. Definitely works.
---
It is annoying for enemies that are not immediately reachable by melee...especially when you are mobbed by them.
---
Happy cake day I love you
---
Thanks for the replies everyone! Looks like my first move when I get back in scrapping and vendoring. I need the caps anyway.
---
Why? Because it's a videogame and it's fun. Imagine that.
---
Grouping with a mule won't have any benefit, if you get too far from team mates the shared perks drop, so you need to keep jumping your mule to you use the perks and then they die cos no one's playing them. Mules are simply for more stash/caps/scrip space. With a mule you get 5 toons so a total of  17000 pounds of storage, 150k caps and 5k scrip, however if you want to take full advantage of the  scrip you want to level the toons to 50 and you will end up with more stash weight
---
I doubt it's anti cheat. There are cheaters out there doing hundreds of thousands of damage and it seems to register just fine. Think it's server problem. Damage you do is client side, but damage reduction is server side. You do X amount of damage and that's what you see in the first place, then it takes some time for servers to calculate your target's damage reduction and it heals back the damage your target shouldn't have taken in the first place
---
I should’ve known it was raiders
---
I think the current system is pretty much perfect.
---
150 Scrip is more than enough when most days 90% of legendary Drops are low Scrip value.I struggle to fill the Quota most days.
---
Bethesda are clever.They give you a reason for logging in each day.
---
They change that.Then there goes another reason for the end of gamer  logging in each day.

---
Ooh.. that's a good idea also.
---
Rad backpack. Are you talking about in the circle or just killing the queen?
---
What are good 1 handed melee weapons. I though 2 handed was better.
---
If they do this I want a refund on my fridge
---
Really either of them
---
I'm hoping that "real" colonel turns up having fled at the last minute, and the dead body was just someone else.
---
Why am I seeing no discount @ purveyor right now? 3* ranged is 100scrip, 3* armour 60, 2* 50. Wtf
---
Bots don't use machine learning. Teaching an AI to navigate a conplicated terrain in an open world game is incredibly hard. The task of just interpreting visual input is collosal. To make it actually play the game in real time in a way that sounds so incredibly human is absolutely impossible, even with our best supercomputers. And I literally work using the fastest supercomputers in the world.
---
It’s tomorrow
---
Oh thank fuck
---
They're tough. Need to be on your game.
---
why isn't melee affected if that is the case?
---
I put them all on display for my video, and it hurt so much scrapping my old house and restarting just to put some mags on a rack. That's what I get for always max budget decorating.
---
&gt;Grouping with a mule won't have any benefit, if you get too far from team mates the shared perks drop
---
Really? Damn, that sucks.
---
I take 60 diluted rad away and 100 stim packs to the queen , I don’t have to worry about her lasting long because I deal 2000 a hit but it is very very very stressful to block, hit , rad away, if I’m hit stim , run , make sure I’m not hit by big mobs, repeat
---
Or use 5000 caps to buy 100 atom points.
---
Some people don’t care about dying and just want to mess around. 100 levels difference can be a little or a lot depending on their level. Like lvl 20 vs 120 is just suicide. Lvl 200 vs 100 can be more balanced depending on the gear.
---
I hope the mosaic floor find it’s way back some day in the future. Finest looking floor and i didn’t buy it. Purchased literally every other floor since then, but I still grieve it.
---
Yeh I agree it's acceptable and probably the right thing to do. I just think it would be hugely dissaponting with the current hype for it.
---
Lmao! What next right! 
---
I wish you the best.
---
I've seen them recently south of the place where you get strangler blooms to spawn. Running around in that swamp. There was another place too on a road by some house not in the mire, ah can't remember off the top of my head.
---
you can be whatever you want on the internet. and by judging by what op said, that's hardly "so incredibly human".
---
and bots can use machine learning. it's probably not feasible in a game like Fo76, but it's definitely doable.
---
My friend and I have been enjoying befriending low levels and helping them grind. It's so fun. You are a saint. Mad props!
---
What I do is get full unyielding because it’s not as tough to level up and give you 15 charisma then level your mule up to 10-15 pick weight reduction perk cards then get the mutation that adds dmg res to teammates then pick a level1-5 perk card and share it
---
-proceeds to weld random pointy rusted metal bits to it-
---
Is there a way to do this or do you need to get lucky with a legendary effect?
---
*Allegedly*. Personally I can deff vouch for it, some servers I can hit up the key locations such as Awol Armaments, Charlston Capitol interior, West Tek etc and I will either find multiple legendaries (particularly 3*) or they will just be standard enemies, maybe a single legendary between the lot of them.
---
And it's the same with Purveyor. I like to blast through scrip once I hit max and I'll either get a couple sellable-to-great rolls or it'll be pure shite. Afaik there's no evidence to suggest it apart from anecdotes but the devs can definitely change parts of the game server side, and I think it's definitely believable some servers would be in favour. This game is very addictive and the legendary system/gameplay loop plays on gambling instincts, so it makes sense for them to make it so people have say 6 bad days, but then have a great session and get something wicked.
---
Well ya..workshops aren't intended to be an exp making method..they are intended to facilitate PvP.
---
I don’t think so
---
You mean the hunters with their poison attacks? They’re stupid powerful and they will drain your health incredibly fast. If it’s just the sonic wave mirelurk kings, I’m not sure. They’re weak as shit so they shouldn’t be two hitting you, hunters I wouldn’t be surprised about though.
---
But they won't have any benefit, strange in numbers for example drops off at a couple hundred metres.
---
I didn't get the white shag carpet, which looked cool with the free orange one. We can only hope mosaic makes a return.
---
Don't let them hit you, take them down from a distance, jump / run from side to side, they have a slow aiming ;)
---
Took down 5 at NAR the other day, only in normal scout / unyel. armor, but it does have one piece of poison resit, 25%...
---
Lot of them went up for sale after survival was shut down. Picked up quite a few good rolls. The ffr rail rifle is a lot of fun. The ts ffr tesla is something I had drop for me last year and sold it. Managed to pick one up after the shutdown too.
---
This one is being billed as a king. Sonic attack is fucking me hardcore.
---
Maybe it works differently? Melees just do no damage at all instead of healing targets
---
Same
---
I was able to run around in a nuke zone with normal armor and my powerfist but I was taking around 8 rads a second. I had to use a diluted rad x (diluted so I keep my mutations), a rad shield, the rad resistant perk rank 5 and rad resist on three of my armor parts. I think if I had a lead lined back pack and more lead lined armor pieces I could have been fine. I was up at 300 rad resist just from chems and almost 400 from my amor. And even with all that I was being irritated pretty heavily where I had to pop a diluted rad away very few mins. I think the rad resist perk card needs a buff to be 50 per tier instead of 10 and then that would allow people to wear normal armor into a nuke zone.
---
Has the discount event started yet?
---
Just came in this afternoon. I've only used it it get from the overseers camp to flatwoods, but the movement and aiming is comparable to PC, though the DPI could use a boost. Using the pre-mapped buttons to navigate the menus will take some getting used to, I keep trying to press E to pick stuff up.
---
I use a Bloodied Explosive Cryolator and it seems to run well with heavy gun perk cards and explosive
---
That's a hefty ask.
---
It maybe lag. Like when do run down in burrows, I sometimes get the corpse attacking on the floor. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tlf7NEvqeo&amp;t=1m15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tlf7NEvqeo&amp;t=1m15s)
---
Tomorrow
---
So how many rounds does it take to lock her up and freeze her? My plan is to freeze her then switch to my aae prime handmade and light her ass up!!
---
Yeah I realized that
---
I absolutely hate crickets. There’s 3 Snallygasters at Toxic Larry’s; not as much acid yield, but isn’t as annoying to farm.
---
It's a second star effect on armors, really helpful for the mirelurks queens and kings
---
I've been noticing a change lately too. This happened with one of the old patches a few months ago. Then it got fixed later. It seems that enemies have a lot more punch for some reason
---
Have they announced a specific time?
---
Oh, I know, but at a low level being able to get \~600 xp from a claim/defend cycle is hard to pass up. Rinse, repeat across the map and you're leveling your toon up in no time.
---
I'm happy to take a head shot or two along the way, it's worth the lost caps to me.
---
I'm visiting my family in WV this week. Coming down from Northern VA, I took the scenic route and I plan on doing the same going back. I've been stopping at IRL places all over the state and plan on posting lots of pictures when I get back!  Included will be Mothman Museum, Camden Park, Helvetia, Flatwoods, Seneca Rocks and more!
---
The first time I encountered it was quite amusing. It was also the first time I was going to Picket's Fort. As I approached the road near the fort I started to hear the pipe music an thought that's what it was coming from... but nope... Just the Pied Piperbot and his followers.
---
Did you try the "Validate / rebuild game files" option in the Launcher?
---
I had this issue with my MC for awhile, and killed some time with side quests until someone suggested it. Solved the problem for me.
---
Personally I run west tek because it’s forgiving to bloodied build and I try speed run 3 bunkers in under an hour every week
---
I normally only have to use a few dozen
---
Usually I try to do an event with legendaries to gauge the pool before I roll anything. Leader of the pack is my go to.
---
Well thats probably a bug
---
Gotcha. Maybe I need to see about putting a couple heavy perks on maybe.
---
I just contracted Rad Worms by reading this thread!
---
I’m a bloodied melee build but I throw them on once I have a lot of cryo cells and have a blast , literally legacy flamers and cryolaters blast you fat when you die
---
lol my friend said he’d give you a fully modded set of strangler heart power armor for $1000 PayPal
---
I wouldn’t use this location if this was the only encounter you were looking for, between the damn and the chemical plant it seems to be hard to load into, at least on console. I would suggest spawning in at Valley Galleria. There is an encounter spawn directly outside of the Red Rockets garage in the corner of the parking lot. This area seems to be a lot more friendly to jumping in and out of servers. If you are looking for more farming locations I made a post a while back about my farming route that you can find in my post history.
---
Yeah I'm broke
---
Gonna have to try for that then. Thanks for the info:)
---
Nice. Only three more badges and I'll snag it. Thanks for the heads up. I totally forgot the lead lined one.
---
Very cool... My gt is ironcleric
---
If you saw teal while playing Fallout 4, you need to get them eyes checked.
---
Tsk tsk where’s that job when you need it most
---
Yeah nobody in my community wants to run it with me
---
What level are you?
---
I seen it by kiddie cabins, I thought it was a glitch at first or maybe something random that came early from wastelanders
---
True
---
You shall henceforth be known as "Sir FuzzyCleric"
---
I'll be on in 30 min.
---
Oh the one in wendigo. Yeah he caught me off guard first time I saw him. I killed him but took me down to 1/4 health in one drain attack. Was in there today for atoms and he wasn't there, should make a video. Bloodied I can see having a problem unless they snipe the balls off his face. I'm happy there's a mob like that in the game, makes you carry a poison resist piece.
---
Got a 3* assassin's fixer from her and it's just on display at my camp. Also, had the fixer plan since the imposter sheepsquach event came out.
---
57 but I can't play right now
---
My intelligence is level 9 and I use both of those. Does this work with say combat armor?
---
I think I was getting like 9 a hit on the queen! Lol. Like I said I was hoping to switch weapons and keep her grounded. Last couple events she has been doing a lot of hovering, regardless of our location so it’s a little irritating!
---
https://discord.gg/Hd7Wvux I am theShaman_No_ID on Ps4. I have never done the raid but we have raid runners
---
I’m down to find that!
---
Cool worms, bro
---
Yep there is a reason some of us file the hate under bandwagon for the most part
---
We're both in the community I'm Swagdaddy-
---
When I hit an enemy with a 300+ damage sledgehammer and they take no damage
---
Yeah we quit doing it when it was confirmed. I'd hate to lose my gear, but they did fix it for him. He ended up with a earlier version of his character and gear. It's been fixed, but kind of late my buddy quit playing after that. Haven't been back since. I want the end game gear but to beat it on expert solo is still something to practice, haven't been hyped to do it.
---
It’s a great event. Difficult, takes team work, good rewards. Not a lot of stuff in this game requires all three.
---
Tried to trade with someone yesterday
---
First attempt the no trade bug.
---
Second attempt got locked into the pipboy menu.
---
Third attempt managed it but had the item be assigned for trade on my end but not visible as for trade on theirs and had to relist.
---
Melee build moment
---
Lmao then I will watch some raid videos. I am a scavenger but I am 105
---
Thank you! Part of what I love about the game is collecting things and some are just so hard to find organically. I just subbed to your channel, too.
---
I built my base next to a node and put a extractor on it near arkos pharmacy but sight alpha dolly sods and the train cars by mountain side bed and breakfast spawn those bears that drop acid or you could try middle mountains cabins but beware spawns rotate you could face 3 bear 3 scorpions or 3 honey beasts
---
Lmao I need to get .308 ammo for my lmg and I need to watch some raid videos
---
I believe I have around 3k .308 but it also might be a different ammo type entirely lol
---
Nice
---
Wasnt looking to beat it on solo as I've got a group I run with but the raids are the only thing we haven't really stomped into the mud. 
---
So the bug has been fixed? Was this mentioned in patch notes?
---
How is he gonna take them when he doesn't have hands lol
---
If it is .308 I will give you all of it. I haven't made a cap off a fellow WVR yet and I don't plan to
---
I completely ran out fighting the scorchbeast queen earlier
---
Thanks I really appreciate it
---
Stealing workshops? Thats how they work, if you can’t adequately defend them don’t capture them.
---
I've literally done it with gun runner added to it and had no problems.
---
By earlier version of his character, do you mean they recovered his characters gear from a previous save point? If so how far back was Bethesda able to restore?
---
It means more inventory space for me lol
---
What got changed?
---
That's why traps work. I agree with you!
---
Think Pawn shops   I paid 12 bucks for mine
---
As you said, you came in late. At the start the game was barely playable, in the sense that lag and stuttering was happening every few seconds, and crashes were hourly. The game improved a lot in the first month after release and has been improving a lot more since. The main drawbacks at the start were the fact that you could run the story in 3-4h, and that you were not killed by skilled mechanics, you were killed due to not being able to fight back by being laggy and enemies teleporting around.
---
I do admit that, although I'm not satisfied with where the game is now, as I know it can still improve a lot, I still enjoy it a lot, and I've been playing it consistently for the past few months after putting it down at the start.
---
It is a good game, but I think only those who were here during beta and day 0 know how frustrating and annoying it was to play. Don't want to detract from your opinion, but you missed out on what the complaints and negative opinions were about.
---
Excited for the content they are bringing, skeptical for how well it will work, I think that's how many of us would describe our thought on the game at the moment.
---
Didn't you sell them at a train station? I was looking around and noticed someone had sold about a hundred nuke mines to the bot
---
I have gun runner , faster movement speed at low health and full Uny armor and speed demon , your frames drop dude unless you have a solid state drive they are dropping
---
I will be on shortly after AEW. About an hour. If you are on join me and I will drop the ammo.
---
I've got to stop picking up the magazines I've already seen, although I haven't had much luck when I tried server hopping. I left three magazines behind, and after server hopping NONE of those spawned, but a magazine I did pick up had respawned.
---
I guess i have a good drive then cause my frames don't drop. Only my food and hunger.
---
Workshops are pvp.
---
All that needs to be said. Survival servers being gone has made no difference. I didn’t even read the original post because it’s just complaining someone didn’t have the “courtesy” to ask you or whatever you think you’re entitled to.
---
It’s a PvP zone. And someone killed you and managed to steal your junk. Use it as a lesson to either not capture workshops until you can adequately defend them or put your junk up more often and you won’t have any reason to cry about it.
---
The loot is random, I consistently get 1* or 2* off of SQB, so I don't think they nerfed it.
---
Alright ill probably be on then I sent a friend request
---
It was a thread he made. Let me get it
---
Awesome opossum
---
Common man your playing an unstable game on a bad drive because it’s a this gen console , people flying  on screens would eat the servers resources and make the servers more unstable
---
Ok so I took a photo of my progress before I loaded up Nuclear Winter... Played a round then loaded up Adventure mode killed something then checked and it slightly moved up *(roughly the amount of XP*) however when I was in Nuclear Winter the "New Level" message still showed.
---
Personally I prefer the two-handed powerful one-hit melee build. You can get over 300+ damage per hit
---
Lol. There's no such thing as "freed up server space", the game runs on AWS and they just spin up servers as needed. The only potential improvement from killing survival is that anyone they had working on can now potentially work on the base game.
---
They said fixed and monitoring for any other issues. It was in the patch notes but I guess they couldn't say 100%. Rare problem it seems that didn't affect many. There was a thread recently on it where they asked the same question and beth replied.
---
Not flying. They would be gliding. There is a difference. In speed that is. Gliding in slower and you slowly go down. While flying is fast and stay in the sky. Due to this difference it probably wouldn't be too bad. Besides, I'm sure they'll fix it when wastelanders comes.
---

---
Completely different development team building on a completely different engine.
---
i enjoy having to make hard choices
---
I mean no one's forcing you to stick to a single weapon. Perk cards can be customized at any time, and you can have perk cards for more than one type of weapon anyways.
---
I do definitely think the perk card system is a weird way of doing it, but you're still not really forced
---
Really? You are going to cry about activating pvp and having someone pvp you? 
---
He most likely left because you didn’t put much of a fight up. Just came here to whine.
---
If you don’t want to pvp then don’t take work shops.
---
What kind of legendaries should I look out for at leader of the pack to see if there is a good pool?
---
Ehhhhhhh , it’s Bethesda , don’t ask them to add anything new, it’s a cool idea but they will make it op or under powered and no one wants it . About your frames, you must have the new gen 5 of consoles or something
---
I have 3 different set.  I have perk cards I swap out for sniping (3? different guns for that), and can switch to commando whenever I want (at least 4 guns for that that I can think of).  In a pinch, I can swap in heavy weapon perks, and there's a half dozen or so heavy guns I can use.
---
Don't know where you're getting the 'one weapon' thing, but it's absolutely not true.
---

---
Official comment from a community manager
---
Literally it seems like half the posts on here is asking for new things. Besides,that would mean not asking for human npcs(which i was fine with) and no wastelanders. Or anything. Just keeping it as it is. Also I've had my ps4 for years. So not new.
---
Really? I have always gotten a 3* item from her but I guess I was just getting lucky.
---
Didn't they say they were working on saved perk loadouts? I think there's a mod too if you need that.
---
Delete this before they change it and take it away from everyone. Currently you can put it on an arm and ALSO have a torso mod.
---
The raids are actually totally manageable and kinda easy if you can get into a stable instance. I’d almost use the word fun, but fixing broken machinery isn’t my favorite.
---
I’m not sure if the game engine is able to provide a lag-free experience reliably.
---
If more vaults are planned for Wastelanders, two things would help. Tougher, smaller groups of enemies instead of a dozen weak ones, and structuring the quest to not rely solely on time limits for a sense of drama. While not the most creative, a series of progressively harder boss fights, ala Punch Out, would be something the game could handle.
---
Encryptid nails what the game is capable of doing well while providing some challenge. A big strong boss, a modicum of teamwork required that a bunch of strangers can handle together, and no timed interactions.
---
It’s because the area is loading and youve already harvested it. Go grab a bunch of other things and it will come back. World items are player specific for spawning.  Someone else can explain this better but you need to grab more items to reset the item count that regulates item spawns
---
Tbh I don't bother with the damage perks unless I'm minmaxing for DPS, nothing in this game is challenging enough that you need to have an optimized "meta" build. So my advice to you: the Tank Killer perk still works with automatic rifles, and if you want a substitute shotgun the Laser and Plasma Scatterguns (and the Dragon but that's super niche) use rifle perks too, not shotgun. My energy weapons character uses an automatic tesla rifle, a semi-auto plasma rifle, and a Gauss Rifle for sniping. It's covered my bases pretty well.
---
I do agree with you on a philosophical level, though. People tend to think more specialization = more RPG-like but the end result, especially for action RPGs, is repetitive gameplay as you're pigeonholed into one weapon class for the entire game.
---
Oof didn’t know what I did here. I mean I jest bethesda I just got confused. Nothing odd to see here.
---
I like the teddy bears rowing a boat in the dried out lake.
---
There are three bugs that have been bothering my wife and I quite a bit lately:
---
1. When I abandon a daily quest, it will come back and re-activate when I log out and log back in. I literally can't get rid of some of them. I don't want to do them. Let me abandon them, Bethesda.
---
2. Some daily quests have a 24 hour timer on them, which is normal for a lot of daily quests in games. What isn't normal is it showing 24 hours, playing for an hour, logging out for the night and then coming back the next day to it still being at 23 hours remaining, or having the clock reset back to 24 hours. This has happened a few times now.
---
3. Reloading a gun, switching to another, reloading that gun, switching back quickly and having the first gun be empty again. (similar to #3 above, but minus the fast traveling)
---
All three happen quite commonly to both my wife and I, so I know it's not just me. The main thing is, if I ignore a daily, it should be gone after a day. It's a daily, not a whenever you get around to it. Sure, I can repeat it daily, but you generally have to go back and get them again, not clutter the side of your screen with every one in existence for all of time solely because you accidentally talked to that one robot, or read that one note that one time. It makes me less likely to want to interact with things if I will have a 50/50 on being forced to accept a quest.
---
Hell, I have simply passed by things and was given quests before. What's up with that? Where's my choice in any of this? Just ignore it all and pretend it isn't cluttering up my screen? Constantly un-track them (which as I stated before, doesn't always work out)? No. Let me say yes or no to accepting the quest to begin with. It should be my choice, and is a very simple request, I would think.
---
I have tried un-tracking them several times as well, and so far two of them have stayed un-tracked, while the rest just re-track themselves when my wife and I log back in.
---
Also, fix the reload bug. I have been caught too many times switching weapons in combat only to have to instantly reload on trigger pull.
---
The rest I have experienced are more mild annoyances than anything, such as the flashlight having that double activation animation and sound, or the quest taking FAR too long to notice it's been updated or completed. Once my wife and I waited around 2 - 3 minutes before the quest realized we completed it. Nothing else was lagging, just that. It was quite confusing.
---
I don't want anyone to think I dislike this game. Quite the opposite, I actually enjoy it quite a lot, and look forward to future updates. These are just some grievances my wife and I have that we would like to see eventually resolved.
---
Speaking as a whale, this doesn't happen. I got a bloodied weapon once. It was a one star lever action that dropped from something I hit. It's still my main weapon. I've never had a bloodied ranged from the veiled meat bag. I had a Junkies explosive handmade drop once but it was lvl 25. I'm level 200+ and, all up, have left at least 10k worth of Stalkers Tire Irons and Nocturnal Shovels in a bag out the front of *it's* shack for others to scrip. Yes, I switch servers and try again ..and again ...and again but I actually want to play the game sometimes, too. I buy every Atom pack that comes out and a lucky day for me is when the bodies of the last 2 legendaries I hit don't disappear. Today is not that day.
---
“Is that intended?” Could be asked of basically all the features in this game. In this case I think not
---
Lmao nailed it
---
Yes really lucky we run three silos 5 times a day and I might get two three stars but mostly 1* armor then the 2* armor
---
Unless you're camped on an acid deposit there's the time and expense of farming or buying it. You also need to go kill a bunch of shit to scrap weapons for the roughly 1k steel you need to make that much ammo.
---
You're seriously underestimating the time it takes to gather all the resources to make 10k rounds.

There is a old video where a guy built next to a random spawn with a tamed radtoad and a pacified deathclaw and its was passed off as both were tamed. Rumor was u needed at least 20% camp budget open. I have tamed arround 9 things so far and find everything to match up with your findings and info as well.  RIP froggert today I joined a buddies game and he just exploded so back to the hunt for me again :(
---
Negative haven't taken any in over 36 hours.
---
Why is this not tending?
---
Well you know how BGS likes to exaggerate and get ppl excited, so I'm not too sure.
---
You do not have to min max.
---
It’s not reset by time. I use to get confused to. Go to the parks and grab a bunch there and other things and it will return.
---
Kill everything you see
---
Whatever you are looking for. I was looking for trade bait at the time so those worked out for me. Ehat are you hoping to get?
---
Yeah but it is still kinda shit, having bugs be in the game that have been patched and unlatched over and over again sucks ass
---
What really sucks is that Bethesda is not telling us if it's been fixed or not. They said they acknowledge the issue and went silent after that. Wtf?
---
How does what he describes sound more complicated than how Bethesda programmed them in FO4? Sure getting stuck on terrain was a problem when you as the player were forcing their path. They were good at taking aim though, and could loot containers.
---
You can’t initiate it now it was put into the normal event cycle. It sucks not being able to start it when your group is ready or even finding it is difficult. It’s a bummer running as a group not being able to control one of the top 3 team oriented public events like you can the other two.
---
You know that logic would track when applied to wheeled vehicles, handheld shields, being able to cook with purified water &amp; not having to resort to cannibalism but here we are.
---
It doesn't fit the game's aesthetic.
---
Do events. You’ll get a good bit of xp for each one. Or if you know of anyone who is higher level, tag along and they can let you tag higher level enemies to help you get xp.
---
Also, taking workshops and doing the first defend is good. Then go to the next and do the same. Just leave your junk in your stash in case if someone shows up and kills you.
---
I've looted well over 500 items since the last time I've collected them this isnt the issue. It has to do with the event.
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Sorry for your loss. Froggert has all the fireflies he can swallow in the sky now.
---
Yes, of course. My unarmed ninja hits the queen for 400 on danger hits, for 1300 from caution and that scales if the bitch faces me and it becomes 2000-3500. Nice little chunks of health. Then I die right after she dies and some idiot grabs my pure Flux. Routine.

Try putting 1 point each into Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, and Master Rifleman (10% + 10% + 10% = 30%) instead of trying to level up the cards. Right now, you're using 5 points for only 20% + 15% = 35%, so you're "wasting" 2 points (for minimal gain) that you could use for another damage buff.
---
Unless you acquired the Combat Rifle plans, you're not dealing full damage potential. You need to find mods to improve performance, or get a higher level player to craft one for your level. 
---
If you have the plans, you need to craft and scrap more than a few rifles to unlock available mods, like the Hardened Reciever (max damage) and Perforating magazine (max armor penetration).
---
SPECIAL point allocation is the basic framework, but it's your Perk card selections that define your character as deadly, tanky, stealthy, etc.
---
With vehicles you've seen how dangerous they are. They take even just a pinch too much damage and your dead. They can't repair it because it had to do with the nuclear reactor. Shields would be useless against explosives bullets that people are so fond of. With purified water, why waste the best water they have when they can use something that is almost as good and is much more plentiful.
---
I meant more like good routes to run since areas are leveled. Seems like all I find is level 5s or 68s lol
---
Could be interesting, having to find different modules to increase budget/stash size/settlement radius/etc.
---
Would definitely need to be implemented right though. No RNG drops or random plans that need 7600 stable flux to craft. If they were given as a dedicated quest reward then I'd be on board with that
---
Thank you! I’ll have to check that route out
---
I get my steel for free from killing people in workshops, so it takes me a total of 1 load screen and a single clip to kill somebody.  And when you get guys that have 500 pounds of junk on them it sets you up for a solid week or longer.
---
I probably have a total of 300 bulk steel on my junk character that I swap around when needed, so I only ever have to stop by lucky hole for lead since hardly anybody carries it.
---
I personally don't go around scrapping weapons but I only said that because that's what most people who run food builds do.
---
&gt; Does not spoil (This could scale with "Good With Salt" perk tree).
---
It's a luck perk. I feel that making canned food shouldn't fall under luck.
---
One time, I was exploring north east of the ammo factory where I found a group of mannequins in a circle. I got curious, and walked over to it before  a cargobot came and dropped a package in the center of it. Basic loot, but I tried going back after Wild Appalachia came out and it got removed.
---
This is why I have given up on my shotgun builds. I have two characters specked for shotguns that I'm slowly moving towards other builds. Last night was the worst yet, every upper level enemy I fought would rebound its life 2 or 4 times before I killed them. I don't notice it with any other weapons I use.
---
Yeah, I certainly do.
---
Wow ok I honestly thought that they nerfed it so people wouldnt have so many shitty 3* items to trade in for the 40 script
---
It takes 50-75 rounds to freeze her solid. If yer bringing the cryo you need to come prepared with 500+ rounds.
---
Who's this Bethany Esda you speak of?
---
Thank you for the info!
---
You must be doing something wrong. My dual melee/gunslinger can kill high level enemies with 2h weapons, pistols and any decent legendary rifle. 
---
Can you share your build and weapons?
---
Wait for the next Meat Week primal cuts events and go nuts. I stocked up on so much acid it's almost criminal. Between that and having my camp on a acid node I still have 60 bulk acid in my storage. That's after crafting tons of gunpowder and making a shit load of ammo.
---
And they are not that hard either: any character can kill 90 percent enemies with a high level combat rifle with no rifle perks. 
---
The game lets you do whatever you want to do: very flexible. Very friendly. 
---
You don't even need to compromise, because you can swap perks.
---
I don’t get prime plans anymore. Haven’t for a few weeks
---
The key phrase here is "if you can get into a stable instance".
---
I ran the Vault missions daily on all difficulties for a good few weeks and those stable instances are few and far in between.  I have 2 full sets of strangler heart PA to show for it. 
---
Survival was the best shot at a stable instance simply because it wasn't popular.
---
Meanwhile a lot of the planned Wastelanders content will use the same instancing technology as Vault 94.  There's a metric SHIT TON of players sitting on the sidelines waiting for wastelanders to drop and when they flood in the servers will be maxed.
---
I get that without timers this might not be game breaking but if basic conversations that took 5 minutes in fo3, nv, and 4 take 45 minutes in fo76 because the instancing tech is so horrifically laggy, how is that going to play out?!?
---
I really don't want to watch yet another slow motion train wreck like the one at launch and thus my op.
---
It could be you loaded into someone else’s cell. ie. someone was there before you recently. The others are right though, you need to loot 180 items before the first item resplendent. So really for the Grafton HS you need to loot like 250 before coming back.
---
Idk its commonly observed by people on here as far a i know noone can really determine why ive noticed it happens more frequently by server hopping
---
The easiest way is to farm the vault raid That's going on this week on novice. No timer, unlimited waves of cave crickets. I usually pull 200-300 acid per novice run
---
I reckon just tie the atom reward to the flatwoods monster. The thing has a pathetic loot pool for how rare it is, this would make killing one a bit more exciting.
---
Nah, it's pretty bad. It's gotten a little bit better, but that's not difficult considering the state it was in when it was released. I'm a massive Fallout fan, so I'm going to play it regardless. However, there is no way I'd be playing it if it wasn't a Fallout game. I imagine most people that still play it are in the same boat.
---
I havent either but I thought that was because I got them all already
---
Ya that’s my assumption too that I have them all but I used to get known ones too so I’m not too sure. I’d like to still get them they sell for a decent amount of caps
---
There a huge pain.i can only kill them in Pa but im still stimpacking every few seconds.
---
&gt;someone who is good with a rifle, will also be good with a handgun, or a shotgun.
---
That makes no sense, dude. Handguns require More skill, rifles are More accurate (long barrel) and shotguns pack a great punch and can be used with moderate success with almost no training in real life.
---
Do you think being good with a knife makes you learn how to fight with a Sword or spear?
---
You need a "firearms expert" perk because maybe you are used to other type of game. But that makes for even less choices: you have firearms and melee. Period.

No your just lucky 🤔 maybe I should have you near me when I kill the queen, if your lucks transferable I'd love you so tired of that Bitch giving me 1* nocturnal raider pieces 🤮
---
There are YT videos about this. They know.
---
Dam they got us
---
You're welcome! My 2h melee character always brings a cryolator to queen fights. I figure if I can't do much damage while she's in the air I might as well lock her in place so the gunners have an easier time lining up shots.
---
Hunters and kings can be tough. The same with some glowing Yao guai.
---
Good. I like a challenge. Otherwise, my commando can kill everything with two .38 bullets.
---
So do you use the long barrel mod then? Because the standard barrel looked like it just puffs out smoke! So I guess you have to be point blank for that to work?
---
I hope with wastelanders that assassins works vs Human npcs or they need to get rid of it.
---
It is a reference to this video Monster Factory made with Fallout 4. They actually have an Easter Egg in FO76 the devs put in as a tribute.
---
"c'est magnifique!  i call it my lukowski mix!"
---
Yea this needs to be a thing. I created a warehouse in FO4 just for power armor displays. Had a lot and with all the skins available wouldn’t mind doing it again.
---
Me either, and I agree.
---
Mine now uses all of my AP with one stumble and jump. The jetpack just fires while doing nothing. I only use it in nuke zones, luckily.
---
Lol you play on xbox? If so I'd totally be down to get in on those runs of yours and hopefully my luck comes back and it works for you 🤣
---
I carry radaways, some rad x, and try to be careful. Lately, I have been avoiding those events where people just nuke the middle of everything and there is no safe zone. Don't like to use power armor. And I am not in love with that comical hazmat suit either.
---
A feature that new vegas had that was removed disapointing its not a thing and caravan lunch i would like that too
---
I've never gotten a double prime plan but I constantly get hundreds of duplicate ultracite plans. To bad you cant sell those lol
---
In my experience, if you use the rug trick to place anything inside, it can make it impossible to move it or place it from blueprint. However, without any rug trick placements, it becomes very flexible and you can place the thing nearly anywhere. 
---
The only items I couldn’t fit anywhere inside where the fridge and armor bench for some reason. Everything else including power armor station will place inside.
---
Bring back the Junk Jet from FO4.
---
It could be a test for NPC's when they come. Make them as life like as possible
---
Not really a problem. If they aren't in the party and they decide to attack you, and you don't attack back, and you end up dying, then they now become wanted for killing you That or they just end up doing minimal damage, because you never shot back at them, and now they are almost completely useless to have around. 
---
If they are wanted before they disband, they will still remain wanted until killed. Just the act of disbanding wouldn't clear a wanted status. That would be pointless.
---
Yeah, it suppresses the shit out of everything. I found out today. Went to punch the queen and my jumping was... Not as high as a kangaroo, Let me tell you...
---
I think we should bury the bastard alive in the cemetary.
---
I usually do 3 stars when there is a sale and 2 star when it is at normal prices.
---
What limb is it on?
---
"Glorious Scorched Hunt?  pffft!  I was there at the dawn of the Great Appalachia Can Scrounge!"
---
I think it makes sense for the chasis to be empty. Power armor should be rare, something people kill for. 
---
In fact, there should be more naked bodies. Like... Everything Is loot. This Is the Wasteland.
---
Ok I didn't know that.
---
Today, on: Things I didn't know I needed until somebody else pointed it out...
---
This sort of thing happened in all of those games?! Oh my god. That means it’s deep rooted in programming error from when it was first observed in the code of the game fallout 3 or even Bioshock (and built upon more and more) - right? I sadly only got the opportunity to experience fallout 4 during original release and play the story/game from then till now obviously. I missed everything prior. Could you describe more please?
---
mine acted the same way. it's kinda buggy.
---
I put mine on an arm before I realized how twitchy it was. removed it right after.
---
Really? Never had a problem on the xo1
---
I've tried to solo it for shits and giggles about twice now. It would always crash.
---
Leader Bobblehead, Well Rested (I think that is the 5% XP bonus, might be Well Tuned), and Cranberry Juice to boost your XP. Then hit up the Whitespring. You should get those last couple levels pretty quick.
---
I've been playing for the last 3 months and yeah that would suck paying 60.00 to not be able to play or run into those problems. I love fallout games and the only reason i didn't buy at start was because it wasn't single player, i picked it up when it was 15.00 and think wow what a great game even bought my wife a ps4 and got her loving the game. In its current state i give it 4 stars out of 5 only because there are still issues that need to get sorted out. I enjoy the market and for the most part the players are great. I look forward to the future of this game and see where it goes.
---
I wanted this in 4.
---
I thought this bug only worked with raider and ultracite?
---
Usually starts at Noon Eastern
---
They arent cheating just because they know how to use a compass and use callouts. It's high Perception and coordination. My team wins almost every match we play as well a d we dont cheat.
---
I have to agree with u the issue is too expensive cap sinks are a good idea but im not droppin 1500 to 2k for a chance to fail it that thing shouldve been 500 caps max id probly buy one in a while if it was
---
I'd go 2 star because you will get more chances since you can sell them back for the 150 daily and get a couple more.  The 3rd effect is nice but the first and second effects are the most important
---
Hmmmm.... You might be right. Probably on my ultracite then. I don't have raider
---
Wait, you're angry that your character cant use everything in the game at once? Lol. Ok.
---
Thanks mate.  Really helpful!
---
Would love that. I never got to complete a successful run of it. Really want to get some plans...
---
I just crafted 120 ultracite plasma cores and it is 2 for 3, 2 plasma core for 3 ultracite plasma cores. I might be wrong, used perk cards.
---
Not cheating mate they are well coordinated and know how to navigate.  I got put on an awesome team and we always won when paired I gotta friend them for sure but its my style as well.
---
I ran 2 in vaccinated with 1 piece of env resist armor and still got rad worms every damn time I fought more than a couple of ghouls, it is stupid.  I am a strong enough build now it is not a killer and I just tend to ignore disease, but it is annoying.
---
amazing, really, really, really nice!  all i need now is a copy of tesla 3, then my collection will be complete, mwa-ahahhaha!
---
Yes. It's very rewarding, personally. It's not my full time though. I just teach one class a semester in the evenings. So I don't have to deal with the politics or the stress of pursuing a full time position... Which is very competitive. So yes I do enjoy it but I'd be a lot more stressed if it was my only job.
---
Teddy bear cooking show.
---
All weight reduction if all ur doing is using it to haul to other characters or just to hold stuff, stash box fills up fast.
---
Couldnt u say the same thing about buying that peice u been lookin for a few months u could probly get it by then and im fairly certain most people dont have max caps on every slot
---
Where’s that one?
---
The same reason you can use a lead pipe as a weapon but not a bowling pin. The same reason you can get screws from typewriters but not from the dozens of cars, motorbikes, bicyles and trucks around the map. The same reason we have 10mm pistols and no cal.22 plinkers. 
---
The game tries to balance itself by giving a number of possibilities regarding food, armor, weapons, junk ítems, etc. Fish were just unlucky, and they are not as "Fallout symbolic" as Stimpaks or Whisky.
---
Thinking you have more choices by having to choose between basic weapons is not my definition of being smart. It doesn't matter if we had a Small guns perk card that gives you damage boost for using handguns, rifles and or shotguns. It would make small guns users have the joy of switching from a 10mm to a combat rifle in the middle of a fight for whatever reason they can think of. Big Guns can get the fatman and missile launcher/grenade launchers in the weapon pool, then you get big guns, small guns and melee.
---
As bethesda has already said for the last few months. There has never been any prooven sercumstance so no one has ever been banned for that.its not a players fault if they play better then anyone else.everyone has diffrent play styals and with mutations it just allows others to further there play styal.
---
It just seems weird to me that no one here sees it the way we do.
---
Well, some prefixes are certainly not so great like Assassins and Stalkers.

Why not bullets there like 1 cap each and weigh less

I use the crystallizing barrel.

Not anymore, except if you take a workshop. It warns you of PVP and you have to accept.
---
It’s much cheaper then fortnite’s 20$ skins
---
U and i are playin a different game then i cant ditch the legendaries fast enough in the scrip machine
---
Also, imagine a professional with a sniper rifle on his hands, then handing him a gun, and he's like "I don't know how to use this" .
---
Ok gotcha. I’m going to put that back in first thing tomorrow. Thanks again for the help
---
This community is actually one of the friendliest I’ve run across, there’s two modes you can play one being no one can hurt you or destroy you ur base the other being a type of hardcore mode where anyone can hurt you and loot you, but I only play the regular mode. There isn’t much to worry about if anything other players usually drop you some loot if they know you’re new.
---
World objects have a **per-character lockout**, based on a history list, instead of time. Each character has a list of 180 most-recently-looted world objects, and a list of 60 most-recently-looted containers. A character must loot enough new things to push old things off their list, before the old things become available again.
---
When you see world objects start disappearing right in front of you, it's because the game just finished loading the data, and started hiding the world objects on your character's history list.

it all depends on the skin, really. was the Liberty Prime one 14$? I didn't think twice regardless.
---
but 8 bucks for a basic blue recolor? that takes literally 1 minute in photoshop? no. not ever.
---
RIP you. I haven't paid a single cent on game and got like 10 god-tier weapons, most of them sold because of build, and I'm only 128 level
---
You make a compelling case
---
What's wrong with using all of the weapons, did it always bother you in the previous fallout games?
---
No need! She was considerate enough to croak on mine.
---
Way ahead of you
---
At the very least, I would suggest making handguns a secondary weapon type, as in, remove it's perks from the game, and make them scale with your Specials, or just your highest invested weapon in the game.

No, he's saying use a regular gun to repair a gun you have of the same type like in 3/NV. 
---
So if you want to repair a BE Assault Rifle but don't have the materials, you could use a regular Assault Rifle and "cannibalize" the latter to repair the former for free

I wouldve killed more players as of now my favorite weapons are useless in pvp i remember some noob and his buddy week 2 of realease were in my camp a wanted guy was using my workbench so i shot him in the face with my blackpowder and shut my door his buddy picks my lock goes wanted i shoot him too they dindnt even come back for their junk
---
If it was a Mr. Fuzzy power armor skin...
---
I'm in for at least a $20.   Not even gonna lie.  Would be the quickest no brainer purchase all day.
---
Any meat or any fruit won't work.
---
Seeing how specific crafting is in this game, this won't work.  Everything is 1 for 1.  Each recipe must have discreet ingredients or it won't fit into the framework. 
---
Otherwise this is solid.
---
More fallout than fallout 4
---
Would be good to find a use for all those jars...
---
Play immersed and you will have fun
---
thanks!
---
Yep.  Experiencing all these on PS4 too.
---
Today i was kilin bots in whitsprings i became invincible and my weapon wouldnt break and i couldnt use vats
---
Looks like we’ll need salt resource nodes then too!
---
Wouldn't be a bad idea to do the same thing for drinks, as in, 1 bourbon bottle + one cap added to the current recipe to make a bottle of bourbon. It would help the price of drinks go up making it more profitable to manufacture drinks, and make the recipe more realistic, also give people a reason to pick up all those bottles laying everywhere.
---
0 dollar. Idc what what fake money prices are tho.

Haha.  We've all been there!

Unfortunetly the lower level u are the more people that try to kill u

3 star armor is always junk and I don't know why. Armor I wear is usually 2 star and under and none were from the shop
---
Oh, that's right, I  hadn't thought of it that way. Thanks for the tip!
---
Quite literally. The biggest problems with online games are always the people lol.
---
Nothing keeps you from using them. Why do you complain? My unarmed ninja keeps an instigating Gauss rifle on himself and I can kill high level enemies, no problem. 1 perception, no rifleman perks. The game gives you impressive carry weight, perks and a wheel so you can carry and choose from a huge variety of weapons.
---
A skin should never be more than $5. We're talking about appeasing the same psychological need as a child who wants a different color sticker. This price would allow more casual players to afford it without much more than a second thought, but it would bother the people who want exclusive, high-rarity skins. New, difficult content with rare rewards would solve that problem, but....
---
lets say the mission has you going to a wendigo cave. leave the server and join a new one and then check if the enemy levels are reasonable

600 for two tone color

800 for 3 tone color

800 for skin such as the apocalypse rider skins
---
1200 for skin like liberty prime

Any power armor specifc skin should be 600

Yes but this feature is still buggy and frustrating

Have you ever done canning? If you mess one little thing up it's ruined. Intelligence &amp; luck are good for it to fall under.
---
I spent a good portion on my childhood canning with my grandma. I had a couple early batches of veggies that I did myself that had to be tossed out after a few weeks. Mess up the wax seal on the jam, or had a bubble you didn't notice? Not safe for consumption.
---
And def upping the amount of materials needed. Like whoa.
---
Oh great. They fixed it and didn't tell us. Would it kill them to include it on patch notes?
---
Radhamsters?
---
Lol I give you props for defending people that exploit game mechanics, do you take this stance on dupers as well?
---
If it's not obvious by now, my complain is that you can't maximize at the very least 2 different weapon categories, without sacrificing other valuable skills.  You can argue that you don't need to min/max, and just go for both weapons, but then what purpose is there to dealing damage with a rifle, and dealing damage with a handgun? Of course, only difference is one is weaker than the other, making this a useless choice in matters of end game circumstances.
---
That made me roll laughing. I can always repost it with a story about how finding all issue #1 comic books for my SO with this guide saved my relationship. It didn't, but upvotes right? Lol. Nah, I don't do it for the ups, I just want to make everyone else's life easier with the maps I make.

My friend and I were level 10 when she set up her camp at Harper's Ferry. Her first play through, my second.

As someone who has raided with speedbmp and other members of the Elysium crew numerous times: this is absolutely 100% true.
---
It's a group raid for a reason - it's not designed to be run solo, or by a haphazard group like you find at SBQ fights. Strategy, communication, and teamwork are key to the Vault raids. You can't just go in expecting to murder everything and problem solved. That's why I love the raids so much... they're dynamic and they require a lot more than just stacking for DPS.
---
Yeah, the lag issues can be a massive pain in the ass, and having to scout out a good, responsive world prior to running a Vault raid is a drag. But the underlying mechanics of the raid, and the need to strategize around them and think quickly? All wonderful.
---
I'm looking forward to the day they open up Vault 96 for raids, too.

Me too. My shotgunner has an instigating pump and an explosive combat. Both see the damage going up and down. It stopped being fun and it Is now a build killer. I am turning him into a heavy gunner.
---
Some really fast commando weapons can cause the rebound effect too, in my experience.
---
Also recently great heards of radstag in the toxic valley, great excuse to cook with high explosives.
---
I would definitely increase the amount if everything for materials. With jams/jellies it's usually a 1:1 ratio for materials (depending on pectin). 5 berries &amp; 5 sugars would be closer to realistic.  Also adding purified water to them as well.
---
I LOVE this idea!
---
There are plenty of them in the TV call me psychotic but I like to pacify them all then hit them with artillery
---
Yeah, damn near had one kill me doing the same thing today.  Born Survivor triggered and it was a bit of a "what the H" moment.
---
Personally, I hope not. I'm not fond of the idea of having a level 300+ player drop in on me and cut me down in three shots just because I swiped a stimpak from some random NPC.
---
Melee has its own problems. Each pellet plus the explosion is too much math for the server. Melee suffers from "ghost hits" which sound like a hit, show damage numbers like a hit, but don't cause damage. 
---
I love the game, but what a mess it Is...
---
"Stop right there criminal scum!"

Thank-you
---
Idk. Just this game with no npcs couldn’t have the system of consequence for actions, but committing crimes like that in the past fallouts and skyrim has consequences. Would make you think that making the stimpak would’ve been easier.
---
Worth it
---
It also breaks vampires as of the date of my post.  I'm not thing to poat a video but vampires definitely breaks after reloading
---
this
---
You will get jumped at some point if you take a workshop as of late.  Best bet is to take it because it’s good zip, then leave it.  Otherwise if you put passive on, you have no worries for PvP.
---
i hope not.. I plan to kill as many as possible
---
The only skins I spent money on were 1000 atoms for the Santa Claus T51 (sleigh bells ringing were cool until I got tired of them), 740 for the Arktos skin when it was on sale so I could have a full Arktos themed character, and then 1400 for the camo skins because they gave you a weapon skins, PA skins, and armor skins in a relatively cheap bundle that seemed a little more p2w. I didn't pay any money for any of those, so really it seems like PA skins aren't really that expensive to me
---
Until you run out of scrip from the machines, you get so much return from unwanted legendaries I would go for 3 stars (3 stars cost 50 and give 40 back, 2 stars cost 50 and give 15 back, so you "only spend 10").
---
That said, 150 scrip from selling is less than four 3 star legendaries (you loose 10 if you sell four 3 stars, so I would sell three 3 stars and two 2 stars to get one more legendary). And once you run out of daily scrip, the sale is still going.
---
If you buy 3 stars only that's 3 legendaries that actually cost 10 scrip before running out. If you bought 2 stars only you would get 10 legendaries that cost 10, more than twice the legendaries compared to 3 stars before running out of daily scrip. Mixing up both would get you 5 legendaries, which is still half the amount compared to 2 stars.
---
And then when you just have too many to sell and you can't get more scrip from the machines before the sale ends...
---
Holy shit I don't know what to do, my head is going to explode.
---
I ran across a radrat in fort defiance that took no damage whatsoever no matter what I used or how often I hit it.
---
My dual glass cannon has all 2h melee perks and all gunslinger perks. Both are equally effective. Absolutely maximized. I use the gun to headshoot from stealth everything, except big bad enemies like a sheepsquach, mirelurk queen, scorchedbeasts on Earth. Those get the baseball bat. 
---
The only ones you can't run at the same Time are the combinations which draw from the same SPECIAL stat, like 1h melee and shotgunner, for instance.
---
You should read better.  The damage resistance goes up... That works fine.  It's the primary effect (bloodied, vampires, etc) that gets broken after reloading.
---
The pricing is not unfair.  The model targets whales and is more profitable then making it affordable for the masses. Same reasons the pretzels in the minibar are overpriced.
---
I wouldn't pay money for a skin ever
---
It made sense to be under the luck tree as "Tenderizer" fits under the charisma tree.
---
Can't blame you lol, I mass produce civil war suits and hats and sell them 8-13 caps to the vendors. Since making them is so cheap, I can earn a profit of over 3000+ caps per mass selling. But that's because my Leather and gold run out quickly.
---
For me it was a radroach, and it chased us all over the asylum even opening doors and using the elevator. Fiercest and more determined enemy I've ever encountered.
---
He's a "peice of shit" for killing someone over the soft cap... Lol, ok.
---
Finally, I can make dog food!
---
It still counts as unarmed.
---
How?? I hate the power armor HUD so much!
---
I miss survival
---
I would kind of like to see that for my player camp, however I would also like to see if we couldn't charge other players for playing the game. A good be set to free play should the owner decide to know.
---
the wastelanders update is what im waiting for to jump back in, I havent played the game in months.
---
It's only meat hook that benefits from both unarmed and 1h perks. And no they didn't pach it.
---
Im wondering the same.
---
I had one and just sold it. I got mine from the antique store in the bog on a bottom shelf
---
Hmm that’s interesting, I’d like to test that out for sure. My melee has a grog axe I’ve ran around with for a long time and I want to change it to maximize dam for sure.
---
You always got jumped at some point for taking workshops, nothing new. I don't have any trouble keeping the three power plants. Just leave your extractors unlocked, and if someone does take your workshop then you just keep looting it because no one ever checks the locks lol
---
Yup. The explosive effect used to do a lot more damage and was subsequently nerfed, but the nerf never affected the legacy weapons. That, in addition to glitching out the projectile, makes them highly sought after in trading circles. People argue their power is offset by their low durability.
---
If Bethesda ever decides to remove legacy weapons from the game, I suggest taking the day off from this subreddit.
---
Have you played fallout before?
---
We will know in 15 minutes
---
same algorhytm
---
I understand the size issue, but I personally just want to display my Giddyup Buttercup.
---
Dude, just stay away from workshops. I don't pvp, but you received a big WARNING when you claimed it.
---
They're all duped shit, so at most they would just cut everyone's inventory down to 1 of each "unique" legacy, like they did back in the Valentine's Day Massacre wipe of 2019
---
You can still kill bloodied. Traps are a thing in the game, but usually only trap high levels. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tlf7NEvqeo&amp;t=2m5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tlf7NEvqeo&amp;t=2m5s)
---
There's a thing to opt out of pvp, but if you're bloodied (low health build that is popular right now) you will get roto rudied by anyone who likes to rp. Usually at a vendor. I've been tempted but guys ran into were low level when out hunting so, no point in raging. Looking for the whale.
---
Yay
---
omg just try it for yourself
---
This too damnit. I am a collector and sell my extra collections of things. I also request a giddy up buttercup display.
---
Never a good idea to claim workshops anymore, it's a home away from home, but this home will get you killed and doesn't do much in the way of profits. Just not worth it unless you are looking for some PvP action.
---
Duped or not, they're bugged weapons not intended to be in the game. Bethesda quietly deleted Bottlecap Mines from players' inventories; imagine the outrage if they did that for actually useful items, that several players spent tens of thousands of caps on (or if they're clowns, real money).
---
The chaotic funnier option would be if they didn't delete duplicates from players' inventory, but instead made them untradeable like Atom Shop items.
---
Im sitting here waiting for it to start while a storm looms over new england with wind gusts of 50mph.
---
That would be fun!
---
Everything else has been EST because the HQ is in Maryland
---
How the hell do you get so much scrip???
---
Hey I know this is off topic from the post but could you elaborate on something for me? 
---
When you say trying to get a server stable enough what are things you look for? I've ran the raids on Novice but looking to run on timed difficulties. The couple of times I have tried I was stuck standing at a door for a minute watching the time dwindle. Are there any signs this will/wont happen outside of starting the raid?
---
No, this is for the people who bought the game. Take your childish views of world harmony back to kindergarten. They do not align with the themes of Fallout.
---
It's all lag. You can see it realtime if you fight mole miners. They'll pop out of the ground and you can't kill them until the server delay is done. Then they'll re-pop out of the ground. Paradise, sometimes the animal runs off into the center section too, so have to check there.
---
Shut up
---
Ah nice
---
Mirelurks have been the most dangerous enemies since like patch 5 or so.  The mirelurk queens got nerfed because everyone would get one shot by her poison.  But the hunters and Kings are still mean af.
---
I chuckle at that one every time.
---
Scorched unarmed damage is crazy high for some reason. 135 for the level 68s. Most deathclaws are indeed weaker.
---
Best way to farm acid is to attend Burning Man
---
Oh man. Some random decided the game was a failure. Fallout 76 is cancelled guys.  Cant wait for fallout 76 2
---
This so much
---
If you're using a PC, check your default audio settings in Windows, both mic and playback. 
---
I've had multiple headsets and each one seems to have different setting requirements to function properly. 
---
I've also stopped using the bloatware apps that come with them, which frequently have their own configuration issues.
---
The game Auto setting didn't work for me for months, but now is OK - and I'm always on "Area" unless already teamed. 
---
Many people have their mic muted because PTT can be a nuisance, and turn chat volume down to preserve ambiance, but if they hear you, they'll converse
---
Yeah, that would be SO NICE. I'd love being able to pick between a few CAMPs. Building is one of my favorite things, and once I get a CAMP I love I hate tearing it down. Having a few to pick between would be amazing.
---
The food and such affect the base damage. The Power fist with the higher base damage has a much higher maximum.  The unarmed perks you can use only take you so far and also only modify the base damage as well.
---
Its why everyone who 1 hits the queen and does the upwards of 20k damage uses  a power fist. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Your ceiling is lower with lower base damage.
---
Jokes on him. This game was dubbed a failure almost a year ago.

No life. Play game.

You are proving how much of a jackass you are.  Obviously I'm reading this, thereby implying that it is still relevant as reference, therefore people do care about this post (particularly because no new patches have been released addressing this problem since this post).  
---
Next point:  if you're a noob, you should probably refrain from putting in your two cents until you're not a noon and know what you're talking about instead of possibly misleading other noobs (better to be thought an idiot and keep quiet than to open your mouth and prove it true).
---
Last point:  if you're trying to be helpful, you should be clear and concise about the message you are trying to relay, rather than being vague without any clear message other than you don't know what you're taking about.  
---
Thanks for opening your mouth and proving it to be true.  Defending your pride has only made it worse.  Consider what I've said and use it as a learning tool for the future.  I've been there, you have, and everyone else has/will.  The only difference is will you learn or will you continue to make the same mistakes.
---
My god, you are me.
---
$5
---
Little more FFR now, but by and large nothing much has changed.
---
I mean downvote him all you want game can be fun but its a overmonitized buggy crapshow.
---
That’s like your opinion man...
---
They're taking away resources from someone who will actually play the game right. Making workshops stupid expensive to take for other players while they stay safe logged out only coming back to collect the resources and log off again. Lol these are the people you are defending.
---
No (wasn't out when I quit) Yes, Yes (all but final overseer) Yes (wearing a black shovel one) Numerous ones except the imposter, No as I could never solo it. 
---
Admittedly my need for screws diminished once I got the right perks, I just did that for so long it's what sticks in the memory. At the end I think I was mainly farming steel for ammo production.   
---
Never got anything decent from Purveyor, as I was trying during the 'Everything you get is +limb damage' period. ;p
---
That’s lame as hell. Are you in ps4?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
I was there and the queen gave me a 1 star pipe pistol lmao hooray! XD
---
The sonic wave is staggering you, but it's the poison that kills you. The one in that cave once killed me 4 times in a row, but when I finally did him, he dropped 4 pieces of 3-star loot. Made me glad I didn't give up.
---
Power armour and whitesprings laps.
---
It's most noticeable during the trading windows. The game stutters the cap counting animation and can't handle well multiple actions at any one time.
---
Maybe we could also get special recipes like vintage nukashine that causes random mutations or blackouts.
---
Wastelander's will be delayed, if they do launch it, it'll be 1/3 the content it should of had.
---
Wouldn't it be awesome if we could somehow obtain that flute?
---
"You have tried this too much, please come back later." Or something would need implementing.
---
I’ve found a mouth harp instrument before but never a flute
---
I began my original message by saying I was a noob. A noob is always uncertain and ignorant of stuff inside the game as I was and still am. I don't care that I am. I let them know that by saying I was a noob. I wasn't pretending to be credible or as if I did know what I was saying. Therefore, it is not my fault if someone reads my message that prefaces saying I'm a noob and then goes out and thinks what I said is true. It was a mere guess and I would've liked and appreciated correction but no.. instead I had some guy come on here and tell me I'm a jackass for no reason 14 days after the post.
---
If you're gonna call someone insults or names at least be clear as to why. Text has no tone to know whether it is negative or positive especially if you don't even know the other person IRL. Only reason why I called you a jackass is because you called me one without reason from how I understand. Your message was simply an attack against me and I was very confused. Call me ignorant or dumb sure but calling me a jackass makes you look like one as well as potentially dumb. Have a goodnight and hope this helps the next ignorant person that crosses paths with you on any social media.
---
This is such a simple idea. I love it. What a CAN do attitude ;)
---
We've got all the salt needed in this game from /r/gaming and /r/fallout
---
I was thinking about this after my edit and you're exactly right--it'd be a canned meat for every type of meat in the game I was just being lazy.
---
 I came to check this post without taking a look at OP's name. After seeing the quality, and the user-friendly format, i didn't even need to check the name; of course it is WickedyChickady :)
---
Oof great idea
---
No, I mean obtain it as an equip-able item, like the camera. And play it to calm animals down and make em follow you around.
---
Thanks! I just found and changed it in the display settings! I haven't looked on there ever since beta ended tbh
---
Sleep before you do the events. Well rested = 5% bonus xp
---
A couple hours server hopping in Whitesprings will get you past level 50 guaranteed.
---
I can see that being part of a charisma build to tame animals, that would be fun though
---
You mean like solving census numbers?
---
Easily exploitable, no thx
---
I was level 140ish at the time to yeah he must have been suicidal. I mean I didn't even attack the guy and let him take about 10 or so hits on me before I fought back.
---
That's lucky.  Months ago I fought that 3\* Mirelurk king in Wendigo cave and it killed me 5x in a row in under 20 secs each time.
---
Finally got it with 6 missiles point blank and a melee attack.  Was rewarded with a Legendary tyre iron. Yay.
---
Some griefier use the bounty to lure players in while high lvl griefers wait in the wings. Engage at own risk, bounty to me is not worth the time. Not big enough reward.
---
Yeah. Have a friend build a ton of locked doors, pick all the locks, hide inside of your grandfathered in concrete base, profit.
---
I'm so angry that they removed those three baseball bat colors, it provided no benefits other than cosmetic, I can understand explosive lazers, But colors for a melee weapon, REALLY? First time I've seen someone remove cosmetic content when it's not necessary.
---
Or you can server hop toxic Larry’s, but it isn’t as good.
---
he was just playing the game, you put yourself in that position no one else. learn over come and mabye leave workshops alone.
---
Yes, Imagine bringing a swarm of animals with you to a fight :)
---
Hey Op are you looking for people to play with on Xbox? I play with a player faction- over 100 members.
---
It is 18+ tho! We run the queen multiple times a day together.
---
The closest thing we have is the shepherds hook that can herd Brahmin
---
it feels like the kings got an armor buff.
---
they weren't this hard a few patches ago.
---
Does this only work if you’re not moving or can you still move around? During the defend events you could maybe stay crouched the whole time.
---
check harppers ferry, it a some what rare spawn but it does spawns in harpers ferry along with the wet suit plans.
---
The day the exchange the camp building and my freedom to be creative for some pre-built bullshit house I can set down pre-built rooms in is the day I stop playing the game!
---
Hated it in skyrim. And loved the building mechanics I'm fo4. Tbh to be able to build like we can in 76 is one reason im not bored with the game yet.
---
They should bring back some kind of bounty system atleast.
---
My next character is going to be built for pvp. My idea is to level to 50, outfit him with everything he needs from my main, then take workshops and wait. Have a couple of friends that are going to do the same. Figure this way it’ll be more of an even fight and might actually be fun.
---
As it stands I’m not specced for pvp at all.
---
Like the bugs that have been in the game for a year now? The atom shop is their highest priority.
---
i agree with you.
---
You haven’t had any issue with pvp?
---
Um, Gorge Junkyard is, like, 10 meters far from Morgantown Airport?
---
facts!!!!!!!
---
check the nuka cola dome, few rear nuka colas spawn inside.
---
Yeah i dont think we need more workshops just to teach noobs. Really pvp is pretty strait forward, ur either a player that runs and guns or a player that use stealth. Be aware that some low level players that take works shops are not new players they are bait. I think new players need to concentrate on moving the game forward not taking a workshop they cant keep if contested. Just my opinion
---
Nocturnal pipe wrench with limb damage seems to be gaining momentum.
---
there's a few tells to look out for. 
---
* cave terminal lagging in between screens
---
* long delay between clicking the option to open the door and the vault door actually opening
---
* inside the vault - terminal lagging in between screens
---
* long delay between picking the difficulty and the announcement
---
* long delay between the announcement and the door actually opening
---
* lag at the first door that you must wait to open
---
If the first few warning signs are bad, you can usually just quit out before even entering the actual mission and save yourself a lot of headaches.
---
Once inside the vault if the terminal used to launch the raid is laggy in between screens, that's strike 2, and also strike 3 if its super laggy.  
---
If it's just kind of laggy
---
I’m having a problem where I can’t get past the Overlook cabin door. I write down the code and when I enter it, I’m denied access.
---
After playing 600+ hours no less lol
---
&gt;!spoiler technically shouldn't purveyor murmrgh should be considered an alive npc too&lt; and &gt;!spoiler Grahm&lt;? Also, what's the deal with robobrains, are they dead humans, or did the brain not die? Cos &gt;!spoiler biv&lt; and &gt;!spoiler Vincent May-Lilly&lt; exist too
---
To be fair, when they mentioned it was a new technology, they meant it was new to BGS and their engine.
---
So is Charleston landfill and Poseidon energy. What’s your point? I said it would make for a good starter workshop not that others aren’t needed.
---
This would be amazing! I could start making some Mystery Meat pies! To bad that even if they like this idea and add it it won't be added into the game until next decade. :(
---
It’s not for them to keep it’s for them to know how it works. Sure pvp is straight and forward and there’s a tooltip that’s pops in the left corner but clearly it’s not enough. 
---
All it would do is show how they work and how to claim them. After that your done move on. No coming back and reclaiming for cheese and farming.
---
maybe civil era suit
---
If people dont like it all they have to do is shut it off and never play it again. Seems very simple no need complaining about it on reddit just move on. Ive only been playing for 3 months and think its a great game, i didnt spend 60.00 i only spent 15.00 so even if it did suck what am i really out a couple meals at McDonalds...lol
---
That’s some good scrip right there.
---
Were do you need milk bottles for?
---
The Wavy Willard park has a whole table filled with jars.
---
So kinda like a tutorial thing, i get it. Wonder if utube has and videos showing anything like that?
---
meet hook are beastly but extra damage to animals kind off kills it, but someone or even you could have some use too it.
---
Thanks👍
---
I hope this post gets the attention of the devs. There is no reason to release Wastelanders if it's going to be a complete lag fest. I really hope they are testing with full or even slightly above current max servers. Wastelanders could be a rebirth for this title or the final nail in the coffin for a lot of people. 
---
Maybe they could try out a few of their fixes on the raids and see if it smooths things out. If they cant smooth the raids then how can one expect an entire new mode to be smooth.
---
I think a faction relationship system is the next best thing. The world doesn't have to change for your actions to have an effect. You'll be more careful about which territory you're going through if you've got enemies out for your blood.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Wasnt there some new about private seevers like a month ago saying they were closer than we think?
---
In any case, whenever it comes out, I hope ita not a subscription based service, and I hope the server software will be released. (It probably [won't](https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1034123132284624896?s=19), but they went back on play to win items so who knows lol)
---
keep the outfits from mission, and a better understanding on what spawn rates are.
---
I mean, you ain't wrong. But I think OP captured the thing that keeps us salty old Day One players around, this idea at the forefront of your mind that anything can kill you and anyone can save you at any time. 
---
For all this games innumerable issues, we do have a pretty awesome community. And I think that was the point OP was trying to make.
---
But we may have to deal with more quests like “Kill Evan”. Took me 2 months of server hopping to finish that one.
---
My 1*mutated modded meat hook does 250Dps with no chems taken.
---
Not at Hemlock.  I have at others but Hemlock is the only one I have yet to have any problems at.
---
Yup. I got an executioners fixer. I've had fixer unlocked as far as I can remember.
---
The three traps on the cliff that launch corpses far off the map.
---
I ran into this a couple of times and it gives me a smile every time
---
You easily make the “concrete base” destructible.  It’s not that difficult to find a way around the exploits.
---
Maybe a “ravaging” effect.  The presence of a wanted player in the camp or workshop of a player they’re not teamed up with causes damage to structures within that camp/workshop.  Hiding in someone’s camp for 5 minutes would total it.
---
I find that “Raider” players in this game pretty much want to kill 10th levels who take workshops.  They are immediately hostile to any mechanism that doesn’t involve them auto-winning.
---
I regularly find them at Fort Defiance, there's a Nuka Cola machine in one of the bathroom stalls. Also Mega Red Rocket in one of the machines. Hope this helps.
---
Your more then welcome :)

There's a Mad Hatters Tea Party table South-East of Aaronholt Homestead.... At the top of a hill

There will be the fallout76 whales who choose to pay into content. Then there will be in game purchase haters. Its blah really. Yes i am a Whale and it is my choice to pay to get content. But it doesent force you to pay for content. Unlike a game i played called skyforge witch only allows you to play certain classes unless your willing to pay in acsess of $60.00 per a class. Then on top of it they have a VIP system you can buy for $$$ witch gives you Pay2Win ellements.then there is Zinamax with eso. It carries the $15.00 per month Plus plan. Also if you pay thousands of rl $$$ you can own every home witch unlocks achivements. Then if your a crafter wanting to be Grand Master Crafter and get the title and achivment. You must pay thousands more to buy premium curracy to unlock thoes items. So what bethesda is doing with the atom shop i see as a minor addition and doesent hide achivements behind them.
---
I have a few legacy weapons my fav is the AAE plasma gatling with prime receiver and beam focuser. It rocks everything it touches. If that got nerfed i would either never show up to a queen fight or change my build to bloodied melee at least until players complain about that and get it nerfed. I guess what im saying is be happy when a player shows up to a queen fight with a overpowered weapon that helps kill the queen quicker otherwise ur spending 20min doing very little.
---
I like the idea. I just doubt there is any way to implement it without it being heavily exploited. You cannot reward caps to one player without taking the same amount away from another. If you do, you create a way for two people to infinitely produce caps.
---
Although it doesn't exactly inspire confidence - if only they'd took that approach to the launch of the game itself. Practically everything they've done so far has brought or re-introduced further issues. Any other developer perhaps, but Bethesda...
---
Alternate idea, have bounties only go down in 20 cap increments. You have a bounty of 500 caps, someone kills you, you come back with a bounty of 480. That way Raiders aren't only raiders until someone kills them, and you can actually have teams of red plays running around instead of them just having a teammate kill them for the bounty as soon as they don't want to fight anymore.
---
Did you check out my humble abodes location yet? Add me and "I'll show you what I did with the place."
---
And things will only get worse if the launch of Wastelanders brings more players (back) into the game. If you need a relatively empty server to get it less laggy then there are fundamental problems - we're talking a game that limits each server to just 2 dozen players.
---
Honestly nothing, everything is on High / Ultra, and as I said I am also lagging in Whitespring but that's literally it.
---
I believe I spent 1800 atoms for the Blackbird paint and didn't regret it yet. Seeing how all my atoms are challenge rewards and I didn't pay money, it's all good.
---
I agree, but I think we should have only a few basic types of canned goods, or they should all be called canned x, so that they are easy to find in our inventories.
---
eg: canned meat, canned veg, canned fruit, canned soup.
---
They should last forever, but have reduced effects. Good for food, but not a super-powerful boost. Fresh food will still be more powerful.
---
Wasn't it Todd Howard that described this as the biggest project BGS has ever done with teams from all over Bethesda being involved? Yet these guys don't collaborate with teams outside their bubble to get it to work?
---
With all the "prepper" types that live in the Free States it makes sense that canning would be a thing, with their makeshift basement bomb shelters
---
 [Retrofuturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism) to be exact.
---
But you have to ask, can a magnetic tape survive a nuclear blast? Especially the EMP?
---
That sounds fun!
---
That’s cool, is there like a rabbit that spawns there?
---
I already have at least nine Perfectly Preserved Pies. I don't need any more.
---
The cleanup one says it's repeatable but I've never been able to get it to start more than once every 24 hours.
---
I’m sure there is but no one should have to go to another place to learn about something as simple as this should be.  
---
Hell it could even be a timed workshop. Give a person 3:00 or so and then they get kicked off for the next person. And so on. Once your time is up Morgantown airport is locked out from you returning to claim it again.
---
Unfortunately that's what workshops are now that survival is gone. I only go to workshops to do people's defend missions now and I'm pretty sure I scare them as I'm over level 200. Then I just do my commie salute and leave cause I'm not a douche.
---
I would understand if someone came to my workshop because obviously at level 200 you would know that it's open pvp, but doing that to a couple of low levels is pretty fucked. You dont even get the full 50 caps per kill for it either so that guys just being a dick
---
It's weird seeing dead bodies of say Responders, wearing their fire hats and stuff, yet most of the time none of it is lootable. Gimme the hat, dead guy!
---
I switched servers a couple of nights ago and talk to the robot and got the quest again. I completed it and got rewards. Did that three times.
---
cranberry cobbler gives 3% xo more than cranberry juice.  just helping not harpin
---
You know, I didn't even think to look, lol.
---
My favorite one is at the central mountain outlook, there’s two dead raiders who killed one another over a game of checkers and as an added plus the checkers used are caps you can pick up! I always leave them though so that other players can see it too though
---
It's not about the pies, it's your 'pies' you wanna put in it.
---
That would be pretty sneaky of them to throw one in, especially with a gold pocket watch laying around
---
Been out of the game for a few months until they fix the damage bug, so idk if they screwed with the challenges and rate of atom acquisition again. At least with the rates they had last time I checked, it would be up to 300 for a recolor, 400 for something that changes the actual armor shape (i.e the x-01 plague skin), and 600 for something that adds a unique feature like the liberty prime voice lines. Not really acceptable to have anything higher considering the amount of time you need to spend grinding daily/weekly challenges to get them, and even less acceptable considering the real money exchange rates for buying atoms
---
I’ve seen that one I like it
---
Im not apposed to it. I think most players view this game as a learn as u go. Im only a lvl 130 and i have made many mistakes but eventually i learn. It could work. Im all for helping players out so if it helps im for it.
---
I feel like it's not gonna change a whole lot. They aren't going to be just walking around you actually have to go to them. 
---
Kinda unrelated but has there been a release date announced? I looked it up but never found anything concrete.
---
It seems like the challenge for this week is bugged. Can not seem to get any events to trigger complete.
---
There has been a lot of sound bugs lately. They have workarounds but it is really annoying. 
---
Also there is the “walking dead” bug. Usually happens in The Burrows but I have seen it elsewhere too.
---
What?
---
I was watching YouTube what in game stuff hasnt been found but put in the game it's there but not found by players yet?
---
If only they didnt kill my CAMP budget displaying them...
---
Cranberry Relish +10% bonus XP
---
This.
---
The rare Fasnacht masks are probably the rarest thing in Fallout existence. The Red Asylum Outfit is the next rarest thing.
---
I haven’t found anything, just “this fall” is all I keep finding from all the old articles and stuff every time I google it.
---
The speed would have to be the same as walking/sprinting at which point you don’t gain anything, so it’s pointless. I’m afraid the idea just isn’t any use with the current engine
---
Upvoted for being a team player but there is now an entry in the personal computer that sends you to a tourist directly!
---
np.  I should add the terminal in the cave isn't always a bad omen, sometimes that will lag a bit but the rest of the run will be smooth so don't quit just based on that alone.
---
Honestly, that's the best compliment I've had all week. Thank you so much! It made me super happy!
---
No one has found the lightsaber yet.
---
I tried killing the sbq a few times without loot, it really sucks
---
I spent the entire time from level 1 to level 100 crouched. Do people actually play NOT in stealth???
---
TIL that packet loss has an entirely different meaning in Australia
---
Explains why the ping is so jumpy...
---
I just joined one on Xbox where the queen disappeared off the map to the south....haven’t seen that bug in forever. Weird thing was that I was able to follow it past the map bounds. I exited the event so had no marker, but eventually found “something”. I heard scorchbeast wings flapping and saw a red dot but she was not visible at all.  And for the time the event was up, random scorched kept spawning in.
---
Overall XBox has been buggy of late...more freezing.
---
This. I’ve been doing events the last couple of days and have more water than I can handle!
---
past performance is not a guarantee of future results
---
I can say from a FACT that it does not run on AWS. Don't go spreading rumors.
---
Hey man, thank you for sharing your concerns. Rest assured that what I specified provides true real 0 AP, and if you do as I say so it will for you. 0% of 32 (handmade base AP cost) equals 0% of 20 (10mm pistol AP cost) and equals 0% of some random big number i.e. 58935030. It is still 0 in the end.
---
What you need to maximise effectiveness of this idea is big magazine, quick reload and appropriate configuration.
---
I did it on XB1 yesterday morning got all loot nothing missing.
---
Agreed. I have 5 pumps running behind my house, all unlocked, with a vending machine so peeps can find me and help themselves.
---
The hero we need but the hero we don’t deserve... thanks for not having like 20x locked purifiers lol that sucks to anyone visiting.
---
Please don't just make it an atomic shop exclusive one :( like the fridge 
---
If you put this in the game as a crafting station make it so that you require the food recipies to craft the caned version 
---
You require the plan for the crafting station 
---
You require the original food recipies unlocked 
---
You require 2 can typs normal and aluminium being the best type 
---
Crafting requirements ideas 
---
Craft 3 caned meats : 3 Lead, 2 steel, food, 1 adhesive
---
This is just a concept it just be great to see this in the game as an added feature or what ever
---
I get alot of purified water from the protest event in toxic valley. I only use them for diluting chems.i drink boiled water.
---
YES YES and YES!
---
I use the magazine perk and consider myself pretty good at remembering where they spawn now. But you know what, I completely forgot about that Summersville area. It’s just one of those places I haven’t been too in months. Thanks for the reminder.
---
I had an encounter like this trying to find the sunken church in the mire. Found it, great, then this lvl 50 2 star mirelurk king appears. Boy oh boy that was a tough fight that cost my stimpak stash dearly. I run bloodied melee build, so you can imagine how many times I had to respawn
---
Only once have I had this encounter!
---
Pet system just needs a complete overhaul to make it a real thing and not just a semi easter-egg/feature as it is. Here's how I would suggest it:
---
1) Pet system new receives a separated UI apart from typical camp-building. You have a number of quota of pets you can own at any given time. 1 Giant pet, 2 medium  pets and 3 small pets. All pets are assigned appropriate size tag.
---
2) Pets now receive their own maintenance stats: Hunger, Health, Combat Prowess and Level. When your pets are in good health, their level rises over time. As pets' level goes up, they receive higher health, slightly more damage and grow slightly bigger. Combat Prowess levels up when pets successfully defend camp events. Combat prowess improve pets' overall damage, action speed, running speed and health. Leveling pets through Combat Prowess is more effective than feeding but happens less often. 
---
3) Pets receive dedicated building tab. Following are categories dedicated to pet keeping: 
---
   3.1) Housing - Determine quality of pets' health recovery, grant varying bonus to leveling and extra max health
---
   3.2) Feeding trough - Determine quality of pets' hunger recovery. Must put real foods into them. Every pet has its own food preference. Bigger through holds more foods and require less frequent refilling. 
---
   3.3) Target practice - Order pet to practice its combat prowess with the target dummy. Different type for different speed of leveling. Perishable and must be repaired. Can only train X amount of EXP per day. 
---
4) Interaction - You can initiate a range of emotes with different kind of pets, e.g., petting, fetching, scratching, etc. 
---
ATOM SHOP and monetisation (cuz why bother implementing this?) - pet skins, pet paints, shelter skins, feed trough skins, target practice skins, pet interaction animations, etc.
---
Player’s shop
---
TSE Lever action? god damn. Lucky guy.  
---
Thats like the only weapon i really like and the best i could find (among about 120 hours) is instigating. and its only lvl25., Im lvl 60 and kept it since i was lvl 30 or so.  
---
Almost nobody sells any lever action guns, let alone with good legendaries...  
---
But I do like making people happy too. So i give away or sell for really cheap. My prices are usually already way way low, and some stuff are just plain free, like an ammo type that i don use, but i get a lot ammo and chems thx to the perk that allows me to search extra in containers.
---
nobody has the weapon i want so i have to farm it
---
Banana ...come on! I wanted
---
Id keep it, its always Nice to be able to nuke stuff when ever you want to, and it dosent really take up Any space
---
 i just want a PTS. Respec vendor bot for (Caps and ofc Atom tokens) for players with no caps. next i want a buff/debuff tracker. and a target dummy i can build in my camp to test dmg.......
---
Great point. I know a lot of companies put their tapes in literal vaults, sheilded from EMP. But considering you just find these things laying around out in the open, they sound crystal clear, hundreds of years later is... impressive to say the least.
---
My bet is that its some kind of mono-layer quartz crystal or something. You knock holes in it with a high powered laser, and read it out like a super long punch-card.
---
Yes for pool table!!! Golf anyone? What better use for Whitesprings now that mobs are so slow to respawn?
---
I’m with you all up until the “kid friendly” this is a world where raiders will rape, murder, and torture. I’d love some side things to just relax with a friend in game
---
We just want a PTS. Respec vendor bot for (Caps and ofc Atom tokens) for  players with no caps. next i want a buff/debuff tracker. and a target  dummy we can build in camp to test dmg on.......
---
Lots of posts about “should I come back”, but it pales in comparison to complaining about legendaries.
---
The main issue with fallout 76 for me has been the lag mostly and out of level sync monsters due to other players registering them first. 
---
Which sort of kills immersion and enjoyment to be honest. If it was a single player game it would have been freaking awesome and well then I would only complain lack of human npc was the only downside to it.
---
I completely agree. If it were some game breaking issue that would make such a mad difference I'd understand but since it already costs 50% more components to produce , the ammo should be 120 . Hope Esda of the Beth changes that though I can imagine this is an issue that has a big chance of being overlooked with other more pressuring bugs/problems in game :/
---
You on PS4? I have a Vampires Exploding Western Revolver you can buy if you like.
---
Yes, but not the obvious way.
---
AA will ignore 50%, leaving 50% left (obviously) 
---
Because TK is only interacting with 50%, it only works at 50% value (So 14% at lvl3?)
---
So 64% Armour Defeating?
---
On PC
---
Think it’s even worth having tank killer on then? Maybe go with ground pounder instead?
---
Ok np.
---
And I also have a vampires exploding .44 gun
---
This event should be called Live and let die. I don't know why but it sounds cool. Great idea btw.
---
they should add it to the fridge \^\^
---
I've been getting back into 76, after having a bad time with it, and it's so much better. The only thing I wish was fixed is the vast amounts of blurry textures I always see.
---
Seems like a pretty bad PR decision to launch such a divisive update along with Wastelanders.
---
That is an awesome idea!!! I need this.
---
Go to one of the shops that has water as a listed resource.  The purifiers you erect there will fill faster.
---
Can this sub please stop with the "one shot" BS. Unless you have less than 110 health, no one is killing you in one shot.
---
There are no legacy plasma rifles (doubles excluded). They never dropped with the explosive effect.
---
Shockwave's math is correct (i think its 18%, not 16, but thats insignificant in the big picture). It may be more beneficial to switch out tank killer, as long as the new perk provides a better damade boost than the additional armor pen.
---
From the top of my head i'd say Tank Killer can still be worth it against heavily armoured enemies.
---
I dont really run automatic builds,but my logic says that ground pounder is good if the gun you're using is slow to reload, so you gain a lot of uptime by the 30% reload soeed boost. But if you have the Speed Demon mutation, which also boosts reload speed, maybe something else is more worth it. 
---
The 30% reload speed will bost your damage though against every enemy, regardless of their armour. So all in all, perks can be really situational, and no build will be best in every situation.
---
Tank Killer is a good perk IMO, i just use that (bloodied rifle build though) anyways. You can never go wrong with armour pen.
---
I mean they have to adress it as WL will see a surge of new players and lads stealth one shotting literally everything in the game is not a sustainable gameplay model - especially with the current tagging mechanic (albeit they agreed to change it). 
---
I also think they'll buff/nerf/adjust many other guns/aspects of the game too. Too many worthless legendary effects, too many OP builds, many aspects of the game have mechanical problems (meat hook and weightless affix for example), many mods, plans, armor etc are absent or have 0.02% rate. caps are worthless atm, 556 is now a secondary currency, 
---
I've started playing this game 2 months ago, and tbh,  nothing substantial has happened. but I always kept up with the game mainly with juice's videos and they seemed to address more issues, both mechanical and technical, during WA dlc wave. If they are to soft relaunch this game they have to address both the balance issues and gameplay issues like non-existent endgame.
---
Yeah, but the 6lb mini nukes are a deal breaker.
---
Cheers, I started to get tired of Watoga, needed a change of scenery.
---
Just happened to me with Encryptid... I saw the damn thing die and roll onto my corpse and then i just got bugged! Agh!
---
Rare reward from Queen of the hunt daily quest in Mire.
---
I believe that just refers to quest givers and major NPCs, not human NPCs as a whole.
---
What if you use the perk card that ignore insects armor by 70% ok top of that?
---
I'd say the same about the holo games. Imagine a display for holotapes. For some reason, when you collect a RobCo Fun, you don't get the magazine, only the holo... i wanna display that
---
For the record, vault rewards are *supposed* to be character bound. A transfer of these is considered an exploit and could probably get you banned if caught.
---
Thanks
---
you dont know shit
---
Damage dealt in PvP is limited to 110 HP per hit, regardless of the damage the player is dealing. A meathook dealing 10,000 damage to the queen will still only deal 110 per hit to a player.
---
Actually 2star during 50% is 25, you get back 15 meaning it still weighs out the same return
---
It's still there. Maximum of 50 per death though.
---
Just curious to know, what weapon are you looking for?
---
You can also hotkey &amp; drink toxic goo for rads. Interesting build, it might be more effective to ditch the 30% exp only damage on demo expert for full 15% overall damage on bloodied mess but looks like itd be fun otherwise besides carryweight perks
---
3 star non explosive double barrel
---
Mine is Larry the lifeguard, he's supposed to prevent drownings in my pool but he spends way too much time on the roof not doing his God damned job!
---
It's VR now
---
Its been really finicky with me. I’ve used the patched suit with a battered fedora and it worked with Tea Time but not with Enclave Events. I changed to a bowler hat which worked with Tea Time but not with collision course. It’s really frustrating
---
You need to do some real damage to the SBQ, the rumored amount is at least 1%.
---
Killing adds is nice, but will not net you anything.
---
I wouldn't spend £80 on the game and another £50 to play it.
---
I had no idea he had mind control. Damn.
---
Ok so it doesn’t matter what the effects are once the second effect is not explosive? 
---
I think what the commenter above is saying is that if you buy cheap legendarys from player vendors and scrip them you can then take your chances with the legendary vendor.
---
Other than that it’s just about going to the usual spots, whitesprings, DMV, doing events etc...
---
Vats with a nuke? 
---
Do you really need to ask?
---
Damn. I think my first sighting of him was like the first or second beta on the PS4.
---
If you ever use green thumb n see a nuked zone, grab as many flux as you can.
---
When the raw flux turns to inert flux, it gives the same water amount, 5% disease resistance and weighs half of what purified does...however you do get 5 rads from it but rads are so easily curable(and if you're running mutations then starched genes 2 will negate radaway cureability)
---
Not sure which one applies first, but the formula is the same. Every consecutive armor ignoring effect stacks multiplicatively.
---
Unless it's a different kind of "armor mitigation". Like lowering the enemy's armor might not have the same effect as ignoring the same amount, different effects my stack differently. Not sure if this is relevant in the armor pen topic though, i cant tell if there are different kinds of armor mitigation; you'd have to ask a dataminer for that.
---
Little off topic regarding the latter point, just to make it more understandable; "stealth" have at least 3-4 kinds of effects that improve your ability to be undetected, and the formula for calculating those is an absolute bitch to figure out. There's detection reduction based on agility, there's chameleon effect from armour, the sneak improvement perk is a 3rd kind of thing, there are stealth fields, armor mods, all of them stack differently together.
---
Not sure if its the same, but if you want definitive answers on the armour mitigatiom formula, you have to try and find someone who datamines the game.
---
There's a damage cut off, if you don't do enough you don't get loot. With some of the bloodied Mele builds running round that can 2 shot the sbq it's becoming more common to not get loot
---
Doesn't that stop once you reach the amount required to get the atoms?
---
But the VR is an inescapable nightmare where you get killed over and over and memory wiped so you never remember!
---
...oh wait thats fallout 3...
---
I'l doubt they gonna nerf bloodied. Adrenal reaction already got a nerf some months ago. Bloodied effect on ranged weapons is really good damage but on melee weapons the STR stack is the biggest issue.
---
This is an excellent idea! There are lots of complex recipes in the game yet we never actually make any of it because it's not worth the effort. If we could preserve things, people might actually start farming up ingredients and making all that good food because their effort wouldn't be for not. Canning is a big thing in rural places (I grew up in such a place) and it would make perfect sense for it to be in the game.
---
Secondary idea: You know how Bethesda likes to put references in Fallout? Make human meat drop when you kill a player. Make it the primary ingredient in a canned item called soylent green.
---
Most damage by a single hit? Easily Bloodied + Unyielding melee. Those fuckers kill the queen in like 2-3 hits, without glitching.
---
Yes I gladly spend 40 caps to claim 5 cap bounties when I see them
---
If you're on PC I can throw you a couple hundred, I have an acid extractor so I swim in the stuff. Usually have it bulked for cheap in my vendor too
---
Can't wait to see a canning station in the atomic shop for 400-700 atoms. Sorry, don't mean to be rude, but that is probably going to be the case.
---
He struck mold, he struck fucking mold
---
Hey what's going on man. I was just wondering if you were able to teleport back into vault 76. And if so, how did it go?
---
Be in range of them when they take it. Berry Mentats is bugged currently and doesn't seem to flag players who are close by when it's taken. Once they die and respawn they seem to be lit up consistently, but if the player taking it dies is a toss up whether it works at all after.
---
** just logged on, putting sugar on favorite to avoid draining AP due unstoppable running across the map **
---
I can confirm that this happen very often now. I do take Workshops too for leveling XP and reward, i restated playing recentely after 6 months, but unlike before now almost every time someone come to contest it when i am inside and not crouched. I guess the meta is changed. 
---
I do plan to piss off pvp'ers by disconnecting from the servers as soon as the workshop is contested
---
I might have one. Let me check my mule
---
there are a few combinations ill settle for but everyone only has explosive
---
The higher your intelligence the higher the charge. I have an alt with max intelligence (with Unyielding gear) just to make overcharged cores (regular or ultracite). Another “trick” I have is that the alt only carries spent cores (less than 1/5 charge remaining) to make the ultracite cores
---
If you can see a players name with the sound indicator that he/she is speaking and cant hear shit, try turning up your MASTER volume. For seem reason other peoples voices are influenced only by master volume
---
Thats kinda bullshit. Should be shared if you doing damage regardless.
---
Don't know mod vales off top of my head but you want heavy bear arm. I can make and mod them. The burning sheep club is good if you like shiney stuff, it makes your crotch glow when holstered and if you're wearing a hat it lights it up while running.
---
So mutch stuff. No budget. 😱😱😱
---
Never seen explosive for sale. The executioner is a mod though.
---
I don't hit whitesprings much anymore, mainly shop vending machines.  Use the stuff I find there to sell or trade for what I want on the trading subreddit.
---
I second this! Use these and sell my purified water
---
Kind of off topic because already answered but vats is the one that doesn't stack. If you have the 50% vats crit legendary, adding the luck cards doesn't increase damage from tests I've done. Tank killer does but like already posted.
---
\*shhhh\* this will be another 'unintended' thing like over-repairing melee weapons and armor giving higher stats that will need to be patched :P
---
oh god oh fuck why would you pass it on its gonna be an atom shop item now
---
Ffr is big. Junkies is getting more popular.  Fixers are huge since they can be legendary from the purveyor.
---
Can't wait to see this being sold for 700 atoms lmao
---
Unknown plans don't have (Known) on them and, because they start with parentheses, the knowm plans are moved to the top of notes and recipes of listed alphabetically. 
---
It would be so redundant to have to read (Known) and (Unknown). I could only imagine you a couple of months ago when this wasn't a thing and you had to take a guess if you knew the Plans/Recipes or not lol
---
I know what I'm doing tonight, thanks!
---
Yeah, but the food would need to lose some benefits if canned, so it's balanced.
---
I have a similar issue sinse the last patch. I can only hear other players very quietly, berely understandable. I have maxed out all game audio volume settings, have tested the effect on team and area speach and it makes no difference. I have checked all OS  audio setting and have updated the audio drivers. I think the Windows settings are OK as it works fine for all other programms like discord or other games. So I think it may be a bug that, as it seems, does not occur to everybody, as my teammates do not have this issue. But if anybody has further ideas on this point, it would be welcome.
---
Always go 3 star armor, regardless of what you want. It's cheaper than 3 star weapons and has the highest chance of giving items with high resale value, due to the high amount of Sentinel's and Cavalier's. This way, you can trade/sell on market subs and use those 10k+ caps from a 1k scrip spree to put toward higher end weapons that are 30k+.
---
I had the same feeling alas.
---
i been playing for 3-4 months. and i’m hooked. but for the love of god if i own a 3 star version of a card i should be able to change the stars of the card when ever, it’s my card, i maxed it out!
---
until the chinese army saves you
---
You are talking about using glass jars. I was thinking an actual crafting machine that kinda works like the brewery so that it's always a good product. It just doesn't feel right to have it perk specific.
---
Caps can get you a lot if you check vendors or bundle it with other items. The 30k cap makes it a pain to do big trades though and some reason even though it's 30k cap, you can only go to 25k when trading, so you have to trade 25k and then 5k to make 30.
---
I doubt they'll nerf bloodied, they still die. They might take some of the glitches out though. There's a stealth glitch too that I found. It let's you farm stealthed while standing up, so you can run around full speed. I have the +5 stealth move buff but it's not as fast as speed demon walk.
---
Can confirm. Queen of the hunt can yield the plan. I got two on one character, 0 on the others. After it was fixed I did 11 tries.
---
Don't forget 'suspicious canned meat' for cannibals! (Made with Ghoul Flesh, Longneck Lukowski style) 😏👍
---
Idk man... I am still experiencing some bugs, like supply crates all empty, frozen and disappearing enemies, quest tasks that have been finished but can't progress, missing inventory items, constant lag despite being in Asian servers and in Asia, dropping out every half hour and having to rejoin a world and then starting your exploration all over again.
---
To search the sub or not to search the sub . . . This is asked frequently, good answers are a click away.

It spawns a lot in the train car to the west of Watoga Station, I've had a few there the last month.

I like creating my own posts because i can interact with the people, and they usually reply back fast.

But i totally understand what you are saying and next time i won't do this! 
---
peace
---
So the person with the legacy explosive energy weapon will always get the drop and normal players will get screwed ? Don't think it works like that...that would be terrible
---
Balance issues like weapons not dealing enough damage or breaking too easy or whatever taking a while to get fixed I understand.  It's not as easy as simply changing some numbers as it needs to be properly tested for the right balance.  This however really is just a clear cut number needing to be changed.  It simply is half of what it should be.  I would hope this can get fixed.  I submitted a ticket at the same time but don't know if it will get noticed and fixed in a timely manner.
---
Thank you very cool
---
i got it from on off the vendors ( cant remeber which one), you need to know the other lining plans before this one will avaliable, you also need luck that one else got it before you.
---
For the Imposter, damage done by others while you hold one of the pylons should count as well.
---
Hopefully with the upcoming improvements in the event reward structure something will change.
---
I like to swap cards. Stealth that switchs to heavy or even stealth melee. Kind of jackass of all trades.
---
I had the same thought once, but it seemed inert flux was heavier than purified water. I have 90% drink reduction though.
---
The Fixer is in the legendary stuff now?
---
AFAIK energy weapons dont have explosive modofiers. Granted, plasma is not pure energy, but im fairly sure it doesnt have it either.
---
No worries, jokes aside it's a great game with issues. Best played with friends. Get used to server instability, and fairly limited (currently) end game content. However the updated content is good, and Wastelanders (the NPC update) sounds promising.
---
You need to deal at least 1% damage. Which is like 5-10 hits with a nonlegendary gatling gun.
---
You're doing an excellent job showing why PvP is the mess that it is.
---
People with little to no knowledge of the actual mechanics find themselves in PvP, then demand changes to a segment of the game they know nothing about. 
---
The damage cap is real. It's not the first one either. Bethesda prevented one-shotting previously. It was capped at 75% of full health iirc. Now it's a hard 110 cap. I'm frequently engaged in PvP and since damage numbers can be displayed now, I've paid close attention to those numbers. No amount of stacking of perks, effects, chems, etc will get you past 110 per hit.  
---
Explosive rounds do count as 2 hits (the bullet, and the explosion) but the secondary hit faces DR just like the first. Against a player running Fireproof/dense these hits are frequently 0 as the two combined provide near complete immunity to explosions.
---
The Gamma Gun can have all (ranged) legendary effects except Explosive. 
---
Source: I'm a Gamma Gun collector/enthousiast
---
They do, except for the Gamma Gun. Explosive legendary weapons got removed from creature droptables a while ago though, so they're very expensive 'legacy' weapons now.
---
I'm more of a lone wolf in fallouts, and also i prefer stealth based characters. Is stealthing a viable option?
---
Learn the plan first and use scrip.
---
Most of the time yeah, a stealth sniper rifle build can get some good damage. Agaisnt the queen (bulk of end game content so far) you may struggle a little as you wont be able to sneak much.
---
Trying holding space/shift/ctrl and scroll it will be faster. I forgot which buttons to press but if u press both and scroll it will be the fastest scroll
---
Please stop giving them new ideas ... let them make some basic stuff frist like an account wide stash or ammo recycling or freaking fix ghost damage .....
---
8 hours today and zero crashes. I've been on 2 different servers that were triple nuked at the Prime fissure. 👍
---
You cannot get shielded from vendors you do have to know the previous plans for it to drop from the queen of the hunt though
---
LMAO. If you can make it to those locations unscathed at LVL 20 you must be a god, let alone tackling inside them. At LVL 20 or 30 those locations are suicide but if you pull it off that's XP farming like a champ, especially during double XP
---
at this point add a category seems more important than better sort.
---
Also an option to hide known plans (and open the window with known hidden by default) will probably be better.
---

---
I have only 25 resistance to poison and it seems to helps tons against them. 50 is the most you will want because you are basically immune to poison by then.
---
From what I've seen its a small program used to cheat, specifically to duplicate items. Somebody apparently hid a virus in the cheat program to troll the said dupers. Furthermore the dupers were allegedly a "cartel" selling their cheat generated items for real money.
---
It's all hearsay as far I'm concerned, but I lean towards this being a targeted "vigilante" attack against cheaters.
---
"A **script** is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor" source: [https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/script](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/script)
---
Exactly. Honestly I have ~550 hours in and sometime am bored. Do you know what I do? Play something else lol.
---
Not wasting 3 points in strength to carry around expensive grenades that require a special, fragile weapon to use.
---
Yeah I know, i have one of those but wanted to have an upgraded version with  explosive.
---
There is a quirk at the moment with explosive weapons that the explosive element to the weapon has a far longer range than the distance the bullet should go.
---
I have a smg explosive with stub mod, it's range should be comparably small yet I can hit and kill things long distance due to the explosion
---
I've played for 4-8 hours multiple times and never experienced a crash, but I'm on PC so maybe that's part of it?
---
the work that has been done already 
---
 would be a absolute shame if this isn't implemented
---
Damn man, insanely good idea. Cant beleive bethesada didnt come up with this. Being able to preserve perishable foods would make so much sense.
---
Wait did they patch heavy armors?
---
It's a good idea, but ask me one question:
---
What happens with vending-machines? And what about items for sale? How its manage if one camp has 4 vending-machines, but the second camp has zero or one?
---
Mine does this when I run solo, too! (Usually happens on expert, that one seems short but pretty smooth, but it never happens on easy, I just run out of time
---
Then I'm suddenly in a respawn screen for some reason. These we are the types of game mechanisms that need have been figured out before release.
---
The thing is, most meta pvp weapons work like shotguns so a single shot will hit you for 10+ times and will one shot you
---
I always get stabbed in the leg after I sell a lot of my adhesive and screws , if you want to sell stuff I put it for as much I would pay for it is if I wanted it. Also keep in mind there’s people with 300k caps across accounts and there is people with 2k caps and only one character
---
if you just want a bloodied handmade, 2* is far more effecient.
---
Not from Bethesda.
---
Uh, I’ve been playing since Beta, and the game was definitely playable. I have a lot of really great memories of my first few weeks playing the game with friends. If anything the atmosphere that existed when the game first released will never happen again, PVP fights erupted between level 5 players with whatever pipe weapon we could find and they’d last a while since nobody was OP yet. Flatwoods was swarming with new players starting the Responders storyline. You’re wrong, the game was very playable and very fun right at the start.
---
This is why people get addicted to gambling. It's all RNG but people see patterns that they think they can beat. Some days, you roll lots of 6s, some days you roll lots of ones. There's no pattern to it. I have one character that's been getting god rolls for the last week and the others have been getting crap. But it means nothing.
---
Well as far as vending and selling prices, I just hopped camps until I got a general idea of how much others were seliing stuff for. Legendary prices are up in the air and change drastically from player to player most of the time.  
---
Armor and perks depends on your play style. Just see what does what and go from there. I'm sure you can find a meta guide but whats the fun if you cant be unique and still kick ass?
---
Why not just do something about it yourself? B clearly aren't. I'm opting for another game. That's my window out.
---
A friend of mine who quit because of the cheating still talks about wanting to DDOS B (I talked him out of it several times). Keeps going on about spoof bots from S.America or some shite. Was upset about the time sinks he put in to reporting and following up about cheaters then the mere inaction.
---
Other have resorted to just downloading/paying for the cheats and claiming to fight fire with fire.
---
I truly want it.Could you exchange？
---
Devs are struggling with a simple bug fix so I don't think it's a good idea to burden them with interesting suggestions
---
Here use this, easy way to compare

---
Wow that's awesome, i will soon have my full magazine rack too :D
---
Pretty sure these chucklefucks think they can pull another Vault 94 without making players angry. Wastelanders will have even more problems than the vault raids. Maybe they'll magically not fuck it up this time, but I highly doubt that.
---
It would be fun if it was a challenge... this is more than just a challenge sadly
---
I don't get why some people act like Bethesda ONLY releases new content in the atom store.. that's just not true.. Backpack (+ small version and all the mods), brewing and fermenting station, various weapons like the Fixer or the Tenderizer. Also new npcs like the Sheepsquatch and don't forget that every major dlc will be FREE in the future. 
---
Yes they for sure did some big mistakes with 76 and broke the promise of a cosmetic only atom store but this kind of mindless bashing is getting old.
---
You have your opinion and I have mine, doesn't mean I'm or wrong or you are. I enjoyed some of it, but I still stopped playing it because it just became too much. And many others did, and the reviews came out and said the same. Just because you don't agree with me doesn't mean I'm wrong. 
---
The game was "playable" but the stuttering and the lag were still there and it definitely detracted from the experience. I had fun going around and doing new things. But I still have the same fun now, and the thing is, the fun I had wasn't so much because of the game, it was because I had friends playing with me that made the game fun.
---
If that were the case no one would put anything worth trying to get
---
Some of the comments are critical but fair - "you are level 200+ and have all this stuff".
---
I'm tuning back and we'll see. I did i again last night - one issue was just standing still while reloading. Reloaded twice, once I did a pre-emptive stim for, the other I didn't (and died). This was after the ISS had regen'd from 50% and was back down to 25%. I think 2 other people joined me, and until I died I could only see their icons wandering around (screen full of plasma and ISS). Once I died one of them did take a pylon so I only had to grab 2, but he died quickly so I grabbed the third and finished.
---
* I started with a full tank and made sure not to kill the ghouls or anything w/ the plasma. This took me 2 reloads, so under 900 plasma (which is good, because that shit is expensive to make)
---
* I do not have good enough gear to face-tank and heal with one rank of Born Survivor (heal at 20%) with the damage output. I need to either move / avoid while reloading or put on Born Survivor at 2 or 3. I don't think I have that perk ranked any higher in my cards so I think I'll try moving first.
---
Tonight when I get on I'm going to try doing the following:
---
* Strip down and remove perk cards to a small core that are being used / useful. 
---
   * Drop Better Criticals, Four Leaf Clover, Action Girl, Adrenaline, Gun Fu.
---
   * Basically run Blocker 3, Rifleman 3/3/3, Tank Killer 3, Fire Proof 3, Rejeuvenated 2, Lone Wanderer, Tenderizer 1, First Aid 3, Gunsmith 3, Bloody Mess 3, Starched Genes 2. I'll fill the rest with weight and other perks.
---
* Remove Sentinel armor pieces and instead go w/ a mixed bag of troubleshooter - but troublehsooter on each limb.
---
Should that work, my next will be with Rifleman at 1/1/1.
---
I've got a heavy gun user and I'll try to see what I can do w/ Emergency Protocols + a vampire weapon. I don't have one on him yet so will need to hunt / farm / buy / purveyor one. Aim would be the same - solo / solo-carry the event with minimal gear. Similar setup but in PA. That may require more healing, esp. in the pylon grab phase before the Vamp kicks in.
---
I do not have a Vamp switchblade or combat knife, else I'd look at that route too on my melee. I have a Vamp/SS machete but I'm not certain that will keep up w/ the damage output on my melee.
---
As an adventure player, so do I.
---
Xbox One matey
---
Feel free to enlighten us.
---
I don’t have any excess ammo sorry but I wouldn’t expect free hand out, I’m happy to keep searching for it just wanted to know where was best but thanks
---
I’ll check out the train carriage thank you!
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Nice one, Ill check it out thank you
---
Yes Please!
---
A permanent Home would be freaking awesome! So i can finally use that otherwise useless Arty.
---
PS4?
---
Absolutely want this too, I posted about making this a reward from the free states since they do love being end of the world preppers and all
---
Nice one I’ll check it out thanks dude
---
hey i'd be interested, psn: marixpohl time zone is GMT+2, have another friend who also wants to farm project paradise
---
You might enjoy that, but others like myself use handguns as a main and really enjoy them. Certainly wouldn't appreciate them becoming secondary weapons..... 
---
The more endgame builds, the greater the variety of play styles you will see. As of right now it would be nice if more builds were on par with each other and weapons better  balanced. Rather than see everyone run around with a silenced handmade or meathook at 19% life.
---
Would love to be a passenger on a vertibot as a means of travelling around the wastes. Maybe have certain spots that go between each other in a fixed route.
---
At the moment my only means of fast travelling is nukashine so having this would indeed be useful lol, maybe act like the carriages do in skyrim where you pay caps to travel to certain areas
---
Same. Server crashes every time in the final boss area.
---
I dident crash at all a few days ago I played 16 hours straight with no crashes!
---
The guy above is misinformed. Anti Armor anything isnt the best. With the way Bethesdas armor penetration algorithm works, anti armor damage maxes at a 29% damage increase no matter how high an enemies DR/ER is. Im not going to get into the numbers explaining this because im not a mathematician, but people have done tons of testing on this. Just search it if you want to see actual numbers. 
---
That said. Heres my opinion on the best. If you want to PVP, but considering your melee id strongly suggest not engaging in it, junkies is the best. The damage cap on players is 110, which is easily achieved with a full health build like junkies. Wear vanguard armor with whatever third perk you prefer, the best being sentinel or cavalier. If you plan on PVE, id suggest bloodied for maximum DPS. Wear bolstering if you plan on usuing guns, melee id suggest unyeilding for the boost to strength to increase your damage. Make sure you have a lot of damage avoidance perks like dodgy, serendipity, and blocker to keep yourself from dying.
---
Yes, he was inside a tree at WS cabins. Stuck he was, like a moth in pine sap.  Was still able to trade...
---
It used to do %100 per bullet biu people bitched so they nerfed it to %25
---
Was nerfed a long time ago.  Actually should be called  1.25 shot.  Thus,  not a true second shot.
---
I keep a few locked for myself in case I need to do some crafting but most of my pumps are open access aswell.
---
the 2 shot was nerfed a long time ago and the 2nd shot does less dmg, plus you need to know that enemies have damage resistances and they deny part of the full dmg you do, also the range makes you lose damage too
---
R u on PC, come come I escort U. After u shot them once. I finish them off with my furious 50 cal
---
Ps4 pro, still freezing and crashing a lot ☹

Who tf would bitch about that? Why not even 100 50? 
---
I get TSR is kinda worth it

But i get better from AAE
---
Nope playstation sorry
---
I have 2K...
---
Only one addition to this great idea - double the amount of sugar. If you've ever made jam for real, you'll know just how much goes in.
---
They are all wearing vault 76 suits under the PA frame and they all look like default Nate from fallout 4. it's a glitch.
---
Wait they added a chainsaw?! How does one acquire said chainsaw?
---
Radiums and Gauss do not have the explosive keyword in their data.
---
Oh no..........Bethesda put in a shop for people to buy cosmetic stuff............with atmos they can just earn in game...........because no one is forcing you or anyone else to spend any real money other than what you paid for the game itself..............tragic
---
Because I live in a country sanctioned, and everything google and amazon related is closed off to our IP. I can not play Division or Apex or many other mobile games that opt to use AWS. But I have no problem connecting and playing with FO76.

Saying the game wasn't playable isn't an opinion, it's a lie because the game was absolutely playable the first day of the BETA. I played uninterrupted for hours, so did a friend on the opposite coast. Reviewers didn't like the game, but players did and still do. I have 6 friends that I play the game regularly with and our friendships have grown over the past year. It's so frustrating that lies about the game convince people that the game is totally broken, to where people are shocked that I have played it nearly daily for a year. This idea that the early months of the game were so bad is a lie. The first few weeks of the game's release were perhaps the most fun and it was a once in a lifetime thing. You can't recreate the first day the vault was open and everyone was starting at the same time.
---
Bloodied unarmed build , you can’t go in nuke zones but if you have a lot of diluted rad away all the time it dose t matter if you get spawned in a nuke zone . Fighting the queen is tough but I get to 2k a hit when my health is low , you just have to adjust to the play style , ( Hit,Block,Rad away ,Block,Hit,Rad Away, Get the mobs off you, stim pack, rad away) and that’s not even in the nuke zone just from the roads she gives off. But I farm west tek and rarely die, one shot everything, barely take damage, no ammo used
---
I do more damage than that and still get nothing at times.
---
I agree, I get the messed up but you can’t hold on to that forever
---
Zero here.
---
Me too, mad Fallout fan. Especially PvP. Just sad I can't enjoy it when I know certain players are using cheat software to enhance their otherwise poor abilities, and worse still - Bethesda continues to do ZERO against it.
---
How do I know about the blocking? Try it, you will still end up on that person's team in the future.
---
Whether or not you get on their actual team is to be determined since that has never happened to me, yet.
---
This line is incorrect in their email that you receive after reporting a player for cheating:
---
"Once you have added them to your Blocked list, you should log out of the game then log back in. This will place you on a different server, and you should never have to encounter this player again."
---
That doesn't work when there's only one instance going of NW /r/Bethesda. Or it doesn't apply to NW anyway?
---
there is a youtube video about many references in the game:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp6Ru\_jSiaM&amp;t=748s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp6Ru_jSiaM&amp;t=748s)
---
Xbox. I still get an occasional freeze, but I have to admit I don't recall when my last server disconnect was(it used to happen multiple times per session sometimes, and I'm only talking 1-3hr sessions). It has been more stable for me for a while now.
---
The reason I would want this feature would be because it’s extremely tedious to find a random spawn point, the pet can die and never come back, (I think) it takes up camp space, and currently the whole systems is buggy plus you can’t do anything with the “pet” so it just walks around and defends the camp, what I want is something that you would buy from the atomic shop that can’t be killed, can be interacted with, and unlike the buggy nature of the existing “pets”, won’t disappear at all when logging out.
---
It's not a lie, as I said, you don't agree with it so you'll never see it the same way I do. And just because you could play the game uninterrupted doesn't mean everyone else could.  I crashed daily playing the game at the start, if not hourly for the first week or so. You had fun and I get that, but that doesn't mean I had. It was fun exploring it at the start, I've made multiple characters in order to experience the story again. But just because I had fun doesn't mean I can recognise the negative bits it had. It's not a lie just because it didn't happen to you. I can ask any of the people I play with, some beta some day 1 and you'll find many will say the same as I do.
---
u wot m8
---
Yes but instead of the dinner thing use the claw game and have the player pay 10 caps for the chance to get something cool like an alien blaster and everything else is just random junk so it’s not all that bad
---
But yongyea and jim sterling are just gonna say it’s a problem Bethesda caused and are selling you the fix cause atomic shop and everyone will believe them cause reasons and fallout 76 will just be even more hated again Cause of them
---
mmm jerky
---
I know in the past, the silo environment sometimes doesn’t fully reset after the last time someone went through, so you can have turrets already disabled in some areas or other changes like that.
---
The whole free States questline idea sounds amazing.
---
They don't anymore, but they used to. Check out the market subreddit and you'll see that Exposive Radium and Gauss Rifles are still being traded. They're also considered legacy weapons
---
I've also owned both.
---
Its in game, and it spawns in certain locations. Mods can be purchased at certain vendors. However it caps at lv. 20, and theres no chance for it to be legendary. Hence this post.
---
They have blue under armor on. You cannot see that it is a vault 76 suit. I just went to defiance to confirm before responding.
---
Thank you, I found your video on Youtube and have used these in the past. The Summerville run is my favorite, not because it is best, but because it is way easier. I think the Pleasant is probably the best results for me, though I have never stuck with it long enough to actually find any of the ones that I needed. usually I am running out of time and just start picking up any magazine I haven't found yet after a few runs. But I do appreciate this work.
---
I like it! Immersive and lived-in. Only the dart board seems to be in an odd place. but that is nitpicking
---
Well thats dummy dumb, regardless i must have one still
---
I want to be able to change the screen colors on my vendors too
---
Mine keeps my cow company.
---
Yes, I have many of them.   Sorry for not being  clearer.  Meant to say that the data clearly shows that they stopped dropping, I think back in Jan?
---
I tend to sell stuff for half the listed price, and most ammo for one cap per shot.  It’s not about making money, but moving product (weight restrictions and all).  (You can grind out junk and sell it at a bot - be sure to bulk it - for caps fairly easily if you need caps).  
---
The armor remains true to FO4.  So if you like leather, you’ll have higher energy resistance, metal - ballistic, combat - balanced (but reduced).  The overall highest is still marine armor.  
---
For Power Armor, T-51 is the best for ballistic and energy, but X-01 is the best overall (but needs to be built by you).  Ultracite is a good second place (beating T-51’s radiation’s resistance).  
---
But, like the other person said, do what you like / fits your preferences.
---
I wasn't on a team, powered up Mononaugh once 100% fixed, solo, and Poseidon solo without full fixes. No dice. Going to try thunder mountain since others have had luck with it.
---
As far as i know:  yes,no yes
---
This week is washout!
---
I just want them to stop wearing vault suits and looking like Fallout 4's protagonist. Months ago they said they'd fix it, but they're still Nate clones in Vault 76 jumpsuits.
---
Yeah I think even now their scream can poison you.
---
I'm not sure what logic is applied in game, but it seems like ANY attack can poison, disease, etc. you from a creature with that tag - and their poison damage got boosted.
---
If I do something like Heart of the Swamp in power armor and the Mirelurk Queen spawns, I know I need to dodge and weave because I've got no poison resistance. When I'm running normal armor I'm usually trying to have 2 pieces on like you do - and then you can really just take it.
---
West tec is good.
---
Replied above but will do hear as well - best I can tell, any of the secondary effects (poison, disease) see to be able to trigger from different attacks. If they are diseased, their scream can give you a disease, etc.
---
Find 2 piece of poison resist armor and try it out.
---
I would also like to see about having a way to design offline and make blueprints to be then used in game as a way to flesh out ideas. Plus I love building and it would be helpful to be able to see if a design might work before spending hours trying while being hit with a sledgehammer.
---
Yessir :D
---
I must be an anomaly.  I play on PC and have almost never crashed.  I do have pretty frequent glitches.  
---
Is crashing common on consoles?
---
BTW, congratulations on not crashing!
---
That would be Berserker Pistolero. Ayayayayy!

Yup!  It’s part of his route.  You can find his route online.

Ive got this bug intermittently as well. I had to click several times before it suceeded.

No, optimized servos reduce AP usage during run, not make you run faster.
---
No, PA (even only frame, without pieces) gives 100% limb damage.

I affect throwable explosives, mines and explosive heavy weapons (fat mans, auto grenade launchers, rocket launchers), but not affect explosive affix effect on some weapons.

 Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!

I've went to this joint and I can assure you they are actually invincible. I run a bloodied stealth, bloodied big guns and melee build and they do not take damage

When I enter a server and can’t place my camp I just take over a workshop and live there.  Blue printed a house for this

I would like to see more done with Bounties, but I admit that I don't know exactly how I would implement it or what it would look like. It would be cool if players who side with Raiders or Settlers saw each other as hsving bounties on the other side maybe?

  Inert flux does the job, and is much lighter than purified water.

Real money? Absolutely zero. I might spend 500/600 atoms on a skin or outfit if I've got enough free ones saved up but I will never spend any real money on anything in that store.

Most of the PA skins look like garbage anyway so I'm not too bothered tbh.
---
Scour the market for cheap legendaries + the legendary farming guides available online. Some are outdated imo though.

Hell yea or like jail time

To be fair, automatic weapons can still kill a player in a fraction of a second. So, while "one shotting" might not be a precise way of saying it, they probably just mean getting killed before having a realistic chance to react. By the way, players with less than 110 health are not necessarily that unusual with the popularity of bloodied weapons.
---
One more thing I wonder about is how the damage cap works with multiple projectiles/hits, such as two-shot and/or explosive legendary weapons, or shotguns?
---
The problem is there is too much synergy with perks with this build and not enough for other builds. For example a bloodied build benefits from unyielding, bolstering, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, serendipity, radicool and others. How many armor pieces, perks etc benefit berserkers, junkies, furious and so on? They need to either nerf bloodied or give more synergy to other builds.

More of an irl thing. Back in the day when the milk man came to your house to drop off glass bottle milk, you had to pay a deposit on the bottles Incase they were broken or lost. 
---
Or, if you’re me and live next to a dairy store, you can still do this. 
---
I mostly meant that i thought if you canned food, you should need a can as part of the recipe, and get a can back after you eat it.
---
Usually have to several times for it to work, if it even does
---
If only they had Brotherhood of Steel outfit skins they could use ...
---
Mine seems to be terminal
---
I sometimes go off the vendor 5+ times trying to get it to work..
---
Mine didn’t start until I had max caps- do you have Mac caps on any characters?
---
I came back to the game recently and found this out the hard way. I don't recall Mirelurk Kings doing this much damage before, but it appears they are doing just a ton of poison damage so they are rough if you aren't prepared.
---
An all time Fallout franchise lover and a year later haven’t purchased FO76?  If you loved the previous this is a no brainer.   Game gets harsh judgement, some of it deserved, but it’s still FO but with friends.  Plus the price is dirt cheap now and next xpac coming soon.
---
Far from currently lol it happens to me regardless seeming
---
It's separated for explosive, but the explosive portion faces resistances on its own and with perks/mod combo can be almost entirely negated. 
---
I'm going to test shotguns against an unarmored target.  I'll throw in a legacy with splitter and a TS too I guess. 
---
It also doesn't apply to rad damage afaik. My TS gamma can kill a full health player (assuming 0 RR) in 4-5 hits.
---
Just played through FO4 after spending months in FO76. FO4 is just so much better, I guess that's what makes people angry.
---
I think there’s a cream for that...
---
Oh :(
---
A few more:
---
  red/white plaid cloth on the ground.  On the cloth is a spoon. Sitting on the edge of the cloth is an Alien toy.  It has a hammer in one hand, salt shaker in the other.  There is a grill in the background.  In front of the alien - a deathclaw egg.  (near the really tall monorail tower in the divide)
---
Couple of teddy bears getting busy next to a box of screws.  
---
wood blocks spelling out "drugs," with a combat knife stuck in the table (palace of the wind)
---
They gave a lot of details at Quakecon. It will be a revamp, not a game mode. Essential NPC’s will be in instanced areas, along with specific quests related to them. Human NPC’s in general will “Infest” the entire map, so you’ll see shopkeepers, bartenders and random encounters in multiple locations. There will also be companions, which for the most part will live at your CAMP.
---
That sucks sorry dude
---
It may be just a coincidence, but I read that Halloween event involves destroying robots at Whitespring, I wonder if that points towards at least some of them being replaced with humans?
---
I juts watched the video last night and I'm about to make the runs. Thanksa
---
It could happen, but speculation is not fact.
---
"November" without an exact date is the most recent information, from QuakeCon about 3 months ago. With all the silence since then, I would not rule out the possibility of a delay, but if everything does still go according to the plans, then maybe around the anniversary of the original launch, 2 weeks after the Halloween event?
---
May have been me. I want to move a number of events off of timer and to be deterministically triggered. They can have a cool down like Encryptid or the silos, but deterministic. Cost should be based on the event - so Project Paradise may be 2-5k.
---
I'd also like to be able to trigger One Violent Night (caps to buy juke box repair kit), Heart of the Swamp (buy a catalyzing fertilizer from Wallace and flush the river), Breach and Clear (turn in mining gear at the terminal so the auto miner thinks staff is showing up to work) and It's a Trap (build / buy some scorched lure / detector).
---
For parity, I wouldn't mind if they were craftable / collectible so it wasn't just a cap sink (but those with caps could just buy them) ... Breach and Clear - need a pickaxe, shovel, bucket, mining helmet, mining light, etc. ... Heart of the Swamp - craft a special fertilizer using fertilizer, spoiled items, toxic goo, etc. etc.
---
Yes they do. You get like 68, and perforating magazines add a bit more. You could give better use to those special points, but I go full penetration anyways because I love to kill high level mutants with my .38 Fixer.
---
Ok thank you, do you know if the assembled torso stacks with the action boy perk?
---
I once found him off the road near robco just.... standing. Wasn't talking and I couldn't interact with him.
---
what about if they also sent people after you?
---
It wasn’t so much that people bitched about it (most people loved it, in fact). It was that the +100% damage from two-shot stacked with the secondary legendary explosive modifier for an additional +100%. That’s just overpowered in the extreme and poor planning by the developers—the developers possibly thought these guns would be insanely rare but dupers changed that quick.
---
Adding to the problem, people were selling those weapons on 3rd party websites for real money—not to mention deliberately crashing servers to make duplicates—and the guns became much more common (ruining an already questionable PvP system).
---
So the devs (rightly) flipped the nerf-switch. It was just too good to last.
---
I play on Xbox with a wired connection and despite the game having many niggling issues, this has never been one of them. 
---
Have you tried and tested your connection before automatically assuming the problem lies with Bethesda?
---
Afaik the chainsaw is made of disappoint rather than badassness
---
(Answer: pretty sure the damage is pretty garbage for it no matter what you do)
---
If your on PS4 add me rams_man
---
The other bug that annoys the hell out of me is the trade bug.. its constantly happening.. almost everyday🙄
---
There would be a use. Uses being that instead of having to find you way through certain places you can glide over them. Need a birds eye view? Glider. Avoiding enemys? Glider. Need to get down from a high place? Glider.
---
I hope not, i have my camp a little down the road, right on the random encounter spot.
---
You can’t glide upwards! The only use is down, which PA already achieves. If you’re wishing to cover distance, it’d crash the game as it wouldn’t load quick enough.
---
Yeah thats is a very good point actually, probably giving more synergy to other builds, would make the the endgame gear more diverse.
---
It’s good I just wished they’d like drop small updates weekly fixing these dumb little things
---
Just have the larger items fill 2 spots
---
Workshops are most useful for low levels, they need the plans and the resources more than high level players.
---
It’s their poison.  They are deadly
---
Good idea, OP, and one that sounds like it can be easily implemented by the 'maintenance' staff left to keep an eye on '76.
---
I agree it can be pretty frustrating- but in all honesty I really really love the game! And I’ll forever be thankful to Beth for brining fallout back :D
---
There's been glitchers with hundreds of meat cleavers and mines without a bag, they're not dropping them, they just appear. I put my lag up to that, almost couldn't do Encryptid on that server
---
It could be as simple as a temporary tent system, throw down the tent with a cooking fire and stash. it allows you to stay on the server with friends until your spot frees up
---
There should be a counter on those things. Every one I come by I have to try 2-3 times. 12 months 1 pie.
---
It’s the same with camp building a lot of the time
---
Yeah i realised, done it now though :)
---
Same here, I sell tons of bulk acid
---
That glitch still isnt patched? Jesus
---
This is probably not a connection problem on the users' side but a server-side problem, since server hopping can fix it. Symptoms include laggy screen updates when interacting with in-game terminals, especially in Silos (up to multiple minutes per screen refresh in the worst cases), laggy quest status and objective marker updates, especially noticeable when doing the athletic courses. (I'm playing on PC and I've experienced all of those.)
---
As far as I know, this is independent of the other currently ongoing big performance problem (raid armor legendary poison effect at public events).
---
This is a neat idea but it's basically just an extension of the fridge idea. And the fridge idea is on the Atom Shop, so either this idea will never happen (because it would undermine sales of the fridge) or it will happen as a more expensive fridge on the Atom Shop (since its functionality extends to trade). 
---
So yea, I doubt it'll ever happen, because even if they did say OK let's put it on the Atom Shop, people would freak out for numerous reasons (its high price, a good community suggestion once more becoming an income strategy for Bethesda, and/or the fridge purchase becoming redundant and a waste of money).
---
Juice head is a smart kid. He doesn’t cheerlead the game nor does he bash it. But he does actually play it. Unlike most of the YouTube talking heads who love to hate.
---
One hits are generally using all 9 weapon-specific damage perks, plus bloody mess, plus bloodied, instigating, and/or stealth. 
---
Heavy guns are less about one-shot and more about mowing down enemies with DPS. 
---
Do you have the 9 heavy gunner perks, stabilized (in power armor), bloodied mess, and some adrenaline? Beyond that, what weapons or perks are you using?
---
You should be able to vats, but have a lower chance to hit players because getting headshots like that is bullllshit
---
I'm on PC and I'm all for it! I still need the two bear arm mod plans.
---
Heard of a cliff. You can glide off them. Also if you cover the distance, as I've stated previously, you would be doing the same speed and sprinting or walking. And i never said glide upwards. You would slowly go down.
---
Same here.  I mean, of course I had a lot of disconnects when duping was running rampant.  But other than that, the most annoying bug I've ever experienced with the game were the spaghetti dogs  And even then I would just respawn and keep right on VATSing those SOBs until they were dead.
---
That's a good question. I think the best solution is to quietly label the vending machines 1 through 4 in the order they are placed. There would be ways to get odd behavior, but nothing insurmountable. The UI could be tweaked by putting a number on the vending icon to tell which machine it is in when you view the item in stash.
---
Hmm, not the worst idea, maybe add a perk card that decreases the hit chance for other players?
---
Those people running around one hitting things are most likely Bloodied builds. It's FO76 version of          min/max. And since you can run around in FO76 with 80% Radiation and have no real adverse side affects, in fact you can get positive affects, the you end up getting like 18 Strength, and so something like 400% extra damage. In my opinion it's broken as fuck, but whatever. 
---
I run a Commando, Tank killer, Adrenaline, Adrenal mutation build, with an Executioners Habdmade. I don't one shot things but I definitely only use a lot of bullets on the more spongey enemies in the Wasteland.
---
A lot of us run bloodied builds (myself included on my new(er) second character. 
---
Essentially, we run low-health builds, and combined with bloodied legendary weapons and perk cards, we do massive amounts of damage. The drawback is that we die very easily unless we are careful. 
---
There are several kinds of bloodied builds, including heavy weapons. 
---
The other build I can think of that can boost damage outputs to extremes are junkie builds - boosting damage through chem addictions and perk cards.
---
Sidenote, two-shot weapons only increase your damage output by a flat 20%. They used to do much more damage before they were nerfed. Anti-armor explosive weapons, for example, will do considerably more damage in my experience.
---
I do this and try to stay in stealth, both for the damage multiplier and to avoid damage. If you unlock the lead lined backpack mod, you take very few rads from the queen but it still won't protect you well enough from nuke zone rads.
---
it's all about your perk cards and legendary effects. I personally use a bloodied big guns build and it's the best choice i ever made in this game.  Relatively inexpensive as well, you can find bloodied 50cals for 5k caps.
---
Funny you mention quest markers...half the time mine aren't showing up. Sometimes even my  custom marker doesn't appear. I'm trying to do the Bucket List but none of the locations are marked.
---
Yep.
---
I'll agree it's overpowered, but I wouldn't call it broken. Running around with only 20% health makes you very squishy. Sure, you kill everything in one shot, but everything else can kill you in one shot.
---
Or one lucky shot if you have Serendipity up.
---
But yeah, it needs a very slight nerf.  Change up armor so that multiple effects can't stack.  One unyielding piece isn't much to write home about. 5 is another matter.
---
TS is 25% (assuming the second shot lands). 
---
Explosive is 20% (of the gun's base damage).
---
Nope. I'm on xbox and playing 4-8 hours without a crash has been my norm for quite some time.
---
Yup! Same name as here!
---
I was out of town, did I miss the sale?
---
Great suggestion. I think it would be an interesting challenge if the different cooking stations made different things. Why can I boil water on a spit???
---
Learn all plans. You might want to keep certain known plans for your own new characters. Hoard rare items and plans for yourself. You can sell fixer legendarys for heaps more in your vending machine.
---
nope it starts today
---
If I were you I'd just learn it and sell fixers you don't want, but you can prolly get a bit for it rn before the perv sale
---
I think there is significantly less PvP these days, unfortunately. A lot of the familiar survival names I had on my fiends list have been mostly “offline” since survival mode was removed.
---
Depends on how far you were when you stopped, I'd say. If you were around the point of being bored to tears, I'd wait. If not, then it wouldn't hurt to hop back in. Not sure when division 2 came out, but the Wild Appalachia update added quite of a bit of things to do like brewing your own alcohol and getting backpacks; still worthwhile to check it out regardless.
---
Depends on what you want out of the game. You could sell it now at a mark-up and buy it later on for cheaper or earn another copy.
---
If it were me though, I would learn it so that I have the chance to get a good legendary version of the fixer such as BE, BFFR, JE, JFFR, etc.
---
Well, do you want 15k caps now or 150k weeks to months from now?
---
It's a matter of whether you want quick cash or are looking to invest. 
---
It's not that scarce where you can't learn it the first time, then farm again. Good 3* versions are extremely sought after and therefore worth a lot right now.
---
Also, with the 50% off legendary vendor sale coming up, you have double the chance of getting one next week by turning in scrip.
---
Love the snowpiercer reference. Awesome movie.

I agree, but it's the running around at 19% health that makes it op
---
I've met him on top of a building at watoga a few times. The building with a small pool and cafe area but not inside anywhere
---
I got 2k on 2 characters so I'm going to try with weapons on one and then armor on the alt
---
I think this is a great idea; even better than the fridge for me. I have yet to feel the need for the fridge because I don't mind grinding for food, which I have found is actually pretty abundant, maybe too abundant.
---
i made my own pickles IRL this year for less than 10 dollars lol
---
My meat will be made of 100% human!
---
That’s what I’m thinking too.
---
I want a port-o-diner that saves 5 pieces of food (from expiration) that lets me sell food easier.
---
Go junkies, it's easy and fun. Can 1 shot things with a pistol. Also you could just get an instigating rifle and 1 shot that way. Make sure you have the damage and armor penetration perks if applicable
---
This is why I love bloodied. To me, it feels much more realistic. I don’t feel like there are many creatures in the wasteland that should be able to survive more than one or two shots to the head (the same is true for my character) so playing bloodied is how I make it more immersive for me.
---
I can't disagree with your points. It most definitely does cheapen it. Take the auto railway rifle for example. There is a weapon that would be completely unviable in PvP without VATS. 
---
I would not cry if it were eliminated from PvP. As long as it is around though I will keep using it against people that use it on me. It's kind of like stealthboys and teslas in my eyes, I only take it to that level when my opponent goes there first.
---
Ok think i will learn and and try to get legendary fixers. Thanks for all the input.
---
Wow!
---
Two shot weapons are pretty bad.
---
i just got back into the game last week and i think its a great time to get back in and get accustomed to the game again and prepare for the wastelanders update and get geared up before it comes out.
---
I don’t want to start a new thread so going to comment here... jumping in on the PSN sale. How well does the game run compared to early days and i guess in general? There’s tons of information about how poor performance was back then, but not much about whether it’s been addressed/fixed since, despite a number of patches. 
---
Planning to play solo and see what happens. If I hate it I’ll only have wasted £18.
---
They’re used in decrypting codes for launching nukes. They can’t be sold so they have no worth.
---
I bought mine for $20 on ebay and have played about 250 hours so far. Yes it's worth it.
---
Oh that’s cool! Thanks for letting me know!
---
Me too. Idk what time zone they are going by.
---
Thanks, I'm on xbox.
---
Well this sucks lol
---
CHECKS OUT! Sucks when trying to pickup your loot bag or use the favorite wheel quickly...literally takes 10 seconds to recognize buttons being pressed.
---
You need them if you want to launch a nuke. If you have 8 of the same silo you can decrypt the code with www.nukacrypt.com
---
&gt;Please note that there are some concerns at the time of this writing, whether the Plan: Plasma Grenade can be obtained from the locked Explosives Crate at all.
---
Yeah I was looking at this thread curiously as I've never heard before people hunting for explosive crates.
---
I was under the impression it may come from level 3 containers and certain events. And your map only had so few of them, plus explosive containers might be different to normal containers in their loot. I don't highly care as I don't hunt for them.
---
Hope that map is useful for someone.
---
Maybe for high level players. But for players who are lower level it could be usefull. Also if i even have one loose screw i will fight a war to keep it. That might just be me though.
---
&gt; Can + 3 of any meat + Salt = Canned Mystery Meat
---
*Adds human meat*
---
Well, a bloodied &lt;anything&gt;  can one shot most enemies in the game, except for those few weapons (drills, syringers, buzz blades, chainsaws, etc.) which are so awful that not even a fully optimized bloodied build can redeem them. :-P
---
If your a fallout fan it's a must. It's a great game
---
Might not be canon 🤔
---
I'm not on Xbox, but I read that in Captain America's voice and with the Avengers theme...
---
Lmao
---
I'm on wired gig and with the Xbox scorpio edition, happens every single time I log on and play. No other game has this issue...even other BETHESDA GAMES. The issue is not with the user.
---
You on PS4?
---
I’ll buy you an Xbox just so I don’t have to play hedge camper 5000 or die
---
And I’ll put my two sense in for glass cannon. For anyone else reading
---
I run PA with emergency protocols, dodgy perk, blocker, fireproof. I am no glass cannon. With all the avoid damage % involved in the perks + dr, it makes you more of a tank than a glass cannon.
---
They normally go by EST and I think they start the sale at noon
---
You don't need to use bloodied! Junkies builds are slightly weaker and you don't have to risk being at low health.
---
I use Junkie/Explosive Rifles. All 9 Rifle damage perks, tank killer(3), bloody mess(3),  demo expert(5),  concentrated fire for the headshots in VATS. Prime JE Railway easily one-shots level 68 super mutants without a crit. Prime JE Lever can one-shot them after the adrenaline perk gets going or with a crit. 
---
Use single shot rifles if you want to save as much money/ammo as possible. Use auto rifles if you want to completely demolish enemies that can't be one-shot. With a good build, auto rifles will also one-shot most common infantry except lv68 super mutants. An auto JE Railway will take them down in two shots(one trigger pull in VATS). 
---
Check out [this short clip](https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/b68af722-a75d-4e98-bfe0-d0aef258c1cb) I just made with a JE Railway. I took out 5 mutants with 10 bullets and it used less than a quarter of my AP bar.
---
I've never done NW ;)
---
This is correct. Also have 30+ luck and Murmurgh gives me trash regularly!!
---
No. VATS is a core component of modern Fallout games, there are entire builds around it and those builds shouldn’t be put at an immediate disadvantage in PvP. 
---
VATS is super easy to counter in this game. Crouch and you can’t be targeted. Use cover and you can’t be targeted. Move around a lot behind objects and you’ll constantly break targeting—it’s maddening to VATS users. 
---
Everybody who calls for removing VATS seems to want a more realistic, skill based PvP fight, but really it just enables more standing still in the open and bunny hopping—there’s nothing realistic or skill based about that.
---
You’ll probably do better than the lvl 160 solo stacking no comms players it consistently puts me with
---
Whew!
---
Thanks for checking! Back to bed!
---
If you're playing a heavy weapon build I suggest using a gatling gun. Even a non-legendary gatling gun with perks like stabilized does very well on top of being extremely ammo efficient. I use 3/3 bear arms and carry around a tickle trunk of gatling guns for different situations but I'm frequently using just the [resolution veteran](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Resolute_Veteran) and the damage is great.
---
Lol off to work 😭
---
Oh my gosh, this just made me feel awful. Last night I sprinted by some guy's camp (he was a level 283, I'm a 59) because a Scorchbeast was chasing me and I only had one weapon.. and it definitely wasn't going to help me kill a Scorchbeast. The guy's missile turrets went off and he came out to help take it down but I never even considered that I basically led it straight to his camp. I was on the road and his camp was literally right next to the road; I was super happy his turrets went off and he helped but now I realize his camp probably took some decent damage. (I did repair a few things that needed it near me.)
---
Nope, the Junk Jet *is* canon. 
---
The canon cannons are the Junk Jet, the Broadsider, and arguably the Minutemen's artillery.  
---
There's also a Howitzer in Fallout 2, but you can't move it.
---
Personally, I would go for 3☆ because I already have "perfect" 2☆ guns. But it sounds like you don't so
---
Damage food buffs stack, str food does not.
---
Oh by all means, I should have clarified that by «skill» I define it with aim, thats a personal thing tho so no shade or nothing
---
That being said positioning and creating a proper build is skill, yes another form than what I was thinking ofc
---
BUT, seing some high level pvp videos on youtube, I often see people run chameleon pieces and frog legs and they straight up stand still, jump up and down vats shooting... I dont really see that as skill, that is as I said: gear rather than skill (build as well) 
---
Also, this game has much more going for it making pvp fun than just vats, mutations especially is something that would make pvp way more fun, if vats was taken out 
---
Right now you could run any mutations, and it wouldnt really matter cause vats would highlight you anyway
---
But aim vs frogleg for example is quite fun to master in NW
---
100% behind this. I am saddened by how often my food rots in my inventory. I'm not even sure what to do with the fertilizer I can make with it.
---
I paid 12k caps for the plan and am always broke so that is huge sum for me.  But I'm happy owning the plan knowing when I burn through my scrip at 50% I might get a good fixer.  But far more likely to get a nocturnal pipe pistol...
---
 Hi happy, I'm Dad!
---
Get whacked on chems and do more damage. Up to 50% more. Less overall damage than bloodied but can be at full health.
---
&gt; Proceeds to glue an animal skull to the front of the helmet
---
10% dmg per addiction
---
Max 5 / 50%
---
Haha..very true
---
signs are there my man, one shotting 91lvl deathclaws is gonna end at some point
---
I’ve been sitting on one in hopes this happens.
---
oh man lol I thought my comment got 28491 downvotes and was practically invisible, I am pleasantly surprised, hi there!
---
With just the smallest amount of prep work cranberry relish is just as easy to make as cobbler. Go to Raleigh's bunker, grab a bunch of gourds and plant them in your camp. Go to Flatwoods and spend five minutes picking snap tails with Green Thumb. Cook all the snap tails into sugar and keep a small cache in your stash. Now whenever you encounter cranberries you have the ingredients to make relish back at your camp. Super easy.
---
the sale will go into effect at 12 pm EST
---
If the frames should have been stolen by someone.
---
Yup been one for 320+ Lvs now m8 Lovin it . I was bloodied at or point but don't like dying ya  know
---
Ohh, so that's why it's called "food build"...
---
I'd use every plan I get my hands on for the first time, especially true for the Fixer imo
---
if you are on PS4, the chat volume setting defaults to zero/off/far left every session.  
---
Need to change it to a non-zero value.
---
BTW, Area chat work fine for me.
---
I can get behind what youre saying, and yeah the survival nerf was laughable, put out a clip about how stupid it was [if youre interested](https://youtu.be/i9qLfLjte74)  
---
(I am aware that this basically is the battle of two potatoes, kinda why I put it out its just soo bad)
---
If it weighs twice as much, provides half the benefits, consumes stash / carry capacity, increases thirst, and poses a modest risk of disease? 
---
That would mitigate any OP factor.
---
Same for me, bloodied was driving me nuts, not being at full health all the time
---
Got my fingers crossed for a junkies lever action or gauss
---
Ooh good points ngl!
---
Ill second this. I strted my heavy with an instigating .50 cal, rough on ammo but man it mowed down mobs. Then i got a furious explosive gatling. Ammo consumption is way low, staggers the hell out of everything. 2 to 3 rounds take down lvl 68 stuff. If you want to do more damage than that you got to do the research and commit to a bloody/junkie build.
---
If nothing else people's vendors should be full of 2 &amp; 3 star legendaries by the weekend!
---
Do you use PA and the stabilized perk? Armor penetration helps. A lot.
---
Not sure why you where downvoted, this tool is really good and easy to use. I've used it for months now. Sometimes you want to know what the difference is between reciever types, perks and any other factor to really min/max your build.
---
Kings definitely got a buff. For the longest time id run throw them but lately they hit harder then the queen. even in the best power armor Just one of them can be a death sentence if i am not careful
---
you should probably be in the ash heap or proximity until about L35.  Find and work on the excavator quest.  
---
Have you done the first part of the Mysteries questline and started recruitment blues?
---
Upvoted because realistic 
---
Yeah that’s my first thought but even a minority of people would put fun stuff in there, which would make it useful.
---
As a high level player I often leave one machine with a “free” tag I’ll put nearly anything in there
---
Yes it is
---
It was nerfed because it was wildly overpowered (it was literally double damage) coupled with the explosive affix affecting both bullets. That being said I think there are still some fringe uses for Two Shot specifically because it technically fires two projectiles. I can't remember what, if any, these are but maybe some other commenter will.
---
Ho boy I’ll need to clean a ton of stash space too so I can store the stuff I can’t scrip right away.
---
Oh now I'm confused as hell.
---
Weightless armour allows Chameleon mutation to work because it doesn't count as armour, this can be painted with BoS mod to improve dmg and eng resistance,  I'm hoping this will also work with Harb of Mystery.
---
Chameleon armour is a secondary perk on armour that cloaks you for 30 seconds when hit. This also can be coated with BoS mod to improve dmg and eng resistance.
---
I'm not aware of any specific BoS armour that isn't just combat armour with the BoS mod on it. You can buy the BoS mod from Vendors or get it as a random drop in one of the buildings at Grafton Steel.
---
I compared an AA/E LMG and a Furious/E LMG and the furious was always better damage.
---
Should have been eaten
---
Yes
---
You can look up the codes to launch the nuke or you can try to decrypt them yourself.  It’s more rewarding but harder as the codes reset at some point in the week
---
All the same
---
I was lead to believe that there would be specialized professions in F76. Our group had cook, armorsmith and weaponsmith designated, I being the cook. We were disappointed to find this was not the case.
---
None of us still play, but I'd still be interested in being a professional cook... I would probably come back to get back to hunting and scavenging, installing a cannery, and stocking my store with it.
---
I run junkies heavy gun/rifle character and love it. My .50 cal very quickly melts all but the highest level enemies. The handmade I use for sneaky time or saving ammo. I've also got a minigun that does crazy DPS but the spinup on it is glitchy so I save it for queen fights where you just point and pour the ammo into her.
---
It was worth never giving up on in the first place.
---
Neat, thanks!
---
Post a picture of your perk loadout. Would make it a lot easier for us to see what you’re doing wrong.
---
If you can find one an instigating Super sledge is really good for one hitting most things, granted the enemy has full health and you're fully leveled up in 2 handed (Slugger)
---
I agree more than not, but some answers here have defended vats pretty good
---
Nice to get more pov’s tho!
---
It is still an online sandbox. If you are looking for immersive questing then it’s not gonna be for you. As far as online sandboxes go; it is worth a second try. There is a decent market if you like vending and trading. There are boss fights now. There is grinding. There are character builds that require armors and guns that will give you a satisfaction in leveling your character. It’s a good game... just in alpha. 
---
I’m sure it will get stale again... but they are constantly updating. If you are in to questing and immersion; there is a new update that will bring npc’s to the wasteland that will really open the door for huge things.
---
It's pretty easy to stay well fed and well hydrated without wasting perks on thru hiker etc. Weight reduction perks are fine and I ain't gonna shit on a food build but for min/maxing I wouldn't have weight reduction perks or be carrying really any spare food
---
I don’t run bloodied and can one tap most mobs. I use an instigating/33 vats accuracy/RW lever. Concentrated firefor vats head shots, covert operative for sneak damage, tank killer for armor piercing all at rank 3. I have the rifleman perks at level 1. As long as the mob is full health and not a bullet sponge big baddie, it’s dead.
---
I would love this as long as it's not going to be implemented like the fridge.
---
It should be added to the base game as should the fridge.
---
But then what would snarky trolls like you do with all your valuable free time?
---
I make Carnivore for daily caps, bone and fertiliser is abuntant.
---
Post a screen cap. I just looked at all angles and saw nothing.
---
Thanks for all the constructive answers, I'll keep waiting.
---
I have a 3 star combat rifle 2 shot legend with explosive damage it somehow feels weaker than a standard one, the explosive aoe is cool but it takes more bullets than a standard with same mods to kill a single enemy, i figured it would be op but its bad can someone explain why thats the case?
---
I think a cool idea would be for high level 3 star legendaries drop 3 star loot. That's prob just me though.
---
Exactly.
---
Depends on what you like.  Depends on what you didn't like about it at launch.  
---
I'm from WV and I have enjoyed the game since launch.  It is not a major disappointment to me, and I would never have said it was "awful," even at pre-Beta.
---
Read the Wiki on Returning.  It's at the top of this subreddit.
---
This has been mostly my experience, with a few exceptions... 
---
The dreaded Glass Cavern fiasco, where a scorchbeast tagged me as I was running into the cavern, yet somehow kept attacking me invisibly from the sky (sounds and all) once I was inside.
---
The melee bug (which still isn't fully fixed) made me delete a level 80 2H character in frustration.  There was a few weeks time period there where I couldn't even 'hit' low level molerats.  
---
Mostly the only times I would put the game down for a bit is because I was fed up with people.  I don't turn on my mic or voice chat anymore, because every time I do I get either screaming kids, adults actively fighting, mouthbreathers chewing so loud i can practically smell the doritos, or racist assholes.  Even then, there is still occasionally people... ugh.  Last night I decided to watch Forged in Fire live because some a-hole spent 20 minutes at my camp just shooting while I was doing some cleanup. Non-stop.  Run around me in circles and shoot.
---
They all require Ultracite and some type of Stabilized Flux in addition to whatever other mats are needed for a specific one. So in that respect, none of them are "easy" to craft.
---
If your asking because you're trying to decide what serum recipe to buy first, then decide that question after you a) have a supply of ultracite scrap to craft with, and b) have a good stack of Stabilized Flux of some type.
---
If you're looking for a good one to sell, maybe start with Marsupial since nearly everyone uses it.
---
Imagine nerfing shotguns into uselessness but leaving Bloodied untouched.
---
Please do not just add it to the atomic shop. Put a rusty version in the game and a clean version in the atomic store.
---
Dot.
---
Not to hijack the thread but what serum do you find sells the best?  I assume marsupial?
---
Never thought of it that way! 
---
I’ll have to give this play style a try
---
Because this game has no bugs. Got it.
---
Once you get the stock you're looking for, you can passively farm it pretty effectively. Junk with acid as scrap includes rat poison, abraxo, bags of fertilizer, stingwing barbs. Some of those items are almost everywhere you go. Check meatbags in super mutant locations for easy bug parts.
---
Did y’all at least keep him and his brahmin safe???
---
My God yes
---
Plus cooking perks would be good
---
I use radshield, diluted radx, simpacks, disease cures, since melee you are up close and personal. In addition consider some food and chem buffs such as fury, glowing steaks, alcohol, nukashine.  Also armor and weapons repair mats are needed such as steel, blaistic fiber, fiberglass, rubber. It all depends on what you use to repair.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
That just stinks
---
I saved up 2k and 2 fixer plans hoping for a fixer.. and unyeilding with ap refresh at least
---
*Flash backs to accidentally stealing a wooden bowl and having an entire town murder me with extreme prejudice*
---
Wow, very cool... this is actually probably one of the best camps I've ever seen. Love the layout, especially how you used the roofing in different places to create layers and spaces. Excellent use of dense clutter as well, really makes it look liveable. 10/10. Bookmarking for future inspiration.
---
Earned it.
---
My explosive harpoon gun is called 'Moby's Dick'
---
Supposedly faction pvp
---
If you want high damage but want to stay away from the low health Bloodied builds, look at Junkie builds! You can have full health and are very versatile with weapons! You will also do a lot of damage with good Junkie Weapons! No way near as much damage as Bloodied but it is still really good and a fun build getting to be a drug addict 😂
---
What sucks is my stash is going to be over weight and so is my character until I dump stuff
---
I have an executioners power fist named: 
---
Bitch, please
---
Think it would have happened regardless no way to prove their data is legit anyway.
---
God I hope so. Please let me take over the wasteland with my fellow mothman cultists
---
Well I personally always keep 100-90 of everything but things like Cloth, Acid, Lead, and Steel Scrap have no limit just for making ammo.
---
If you are not killing queen for the repair kits I would stack up on ballistic Fiber to repair armor.
---
Speed demon, marsupial, and healing factor is the holy trinity.   All sell close to the same rate and most times people will buy all three at the same time.
---
I know but plans require ingredients, that’s why I asked
---
You get a chance at other rewards on that last one though. I got a Responders Fireman outfit last week.
---
Thanks.  I'm thinking of getting in the serum business
---
Can you elaborate on your experience with the resolute veteran and why you prefer it?
---
Thats literally the easiest fix in the book, simply change the damage value to something thats not super OP but also not so worthlessly small
---
Suppressors Baseball bat dubbed .”Sit Down and Shut Up”
---
Btw I love that a responder base included the mothman museum and statue, so you guys just set up an altar outside. So evidently we don’t have beef.
---
&gt; people still wanting to ask if it's "safe to run V94" before doing so
---
they gave the ok over twitter a while ago. but it wasnt put in the patch notes or made announcement for some reason
---
I would love that. I want to be able to shoot people without being a dick. Not trying to kill. But create interesting stories.
---
I just bought the marsupial recipe and it's easy enough. Uses crimson flux.
---
Oh then I recommend going to the river by vault 76 and going up and down it lots of plants
---
It actually was because players used to farm the bugged fake legendary ghouls (without stars) that spawned after a nuke.
---
In french : dans ton cul ....
---
Did you scroll down and compare it when monsters have high DR?  If you're not at 4  stack or less with furious and the monster has 300 Dr the AA is better. So it's relative to the amount of hits and the amount of DR the monster has. The SBQ section is new, that wasn't there the other day, so that's cool
---
You could probably get a little more for it. Pistol builds are kinda weak but Instigating would make it great for solo farming. But yeah around 4-8k is where I would put it as the .44 isn't even the best pistol. Stick it in your vendor for around 5-6k and it will sell
---
It absolutely is a story problem, but it nullifies so many otherwise good dialogue choices. It essentially pulls back the curtain and reveals that you never really had a choice to begin with.
---
If you crafting plasma cores stack copper and nuclear waste
---
I've got an extra 2* Bloodied/+10% DWA handmade and an extra 3* Bloodied/+33% VATS Chance/+1 Agility handmade packed away.  If you blow up all that scrip and don't get what you're looking for, hit me up.  I'm looking for a FFR Fixer.
---
 Hi looking, I'm Dad!
---
Did you mean Liberty Prime PA? 
---
For real though, I feel your pain man (I dont own the scrap bot, but I do own Liberty prime PA, same difference really)
---
Is the 50% here?
---
I agree too that it's over powered, but I love it either way. And I'm afraid that if they nerf it, they are going to nerf it too hard and it'll literally be broken to the point of no one using it anymore. Queen fights, I die alot if I get careless. And since the data miners confirmed it that poison damage did get an increase ... I consider that a nerf in itself for bloodied. When my guy gets even a sniff of poison, health immediately falls down.
---
yes, let's make it even more like an FPS. Let's do away with character skill and just make it player skill based.. /s
---
That's just what I want to do, the same tedious ammo-chewing fight that I've been doing for almost a year now.
---
Given how punitive and fussy the camp system is, I can only say yes. Yes. God, please yes.
---
They say "blooded" but mean any build that uses the low-health perks. I have a 'toon using unyielding everything with the high-radiation perks that I call a blooded, but his primary weapon is actually a vampire hook.
---
Great joke, bot.  Dick.
---
Wow congrats on the awesome roll! I got a furious executioner's after the purveyor started dropping them. You won't beat out the other meta builds as far as DPS goes, but it's an extremely viable weapon otherwise. My revolver does almost as much damage as my lever action, and it costs so much less for vats. Good luck I'm sure you'll have a blast, and even if you don't end up using it as a main it's an incredibly good backup.
---
Just joined this reddit... and people are still asking this question?? Lol a simple google search will do wonders friends.
---
To add on to the other replies:
---
\- There are 3 silo's in the game that launch nukes. A code could be for either of the 3, you need 8 for a specific silo ie all Alpha, to launch a nuke
---
\- You won't get duplicate codes, they'll be unique, but could be from any silo
---
\- The codes expire every week, so don't worry about collecting them as every Monday night they'll be removed from your inventory
---
\- As you progress through the game you'll get to a point where you can pinpoint specific commanders for silo's, and follow a quest marker to pick them off
---
\- Ultimately you don't need them as LessThannDennis noted, the weekly code by silo is posted online in various places. Once you get to the point in the game where you can get into the silo's etc you can just look it up
---
\- Perhaps more importantly for a low level is if you see the vertibots hovering with the smaller cargo bot. Should you shoot them down the box the cargobot drops will contain amongst other things a Nuclear Keycard. Make sure you get and keep these, one is required and consumed everytime you launch a nuke, but otherwise will stay in your inventory and don't expire so worth picking up whenever you can.
---
You can boil water on a spit in real life.
---
This event confuses me.  I kill the 3 wolves but I never find the alpha.  Where does it spawn?
---
Wow! This is very helpful! Thanks for the info.
---
Every time I start to get excited about wastelanders I think about the number of existing bugs and how much the game constantly groans under it's own weight. 
---
Don't get me wrong. For the most part, I've very much enjoyed my time with FO76, but it still needs a lot of work.
---
Yeah, I had to settle for a machete in the kitchen. It'll do but not quite what I was going for!
---
It spawns at the horde Event in the forest that takes place right after. You might have to look for it on the map, but it usually will pop up on your screen
---
All Im saying is if two people pvp, one guy has a two shot handmade, the other a regular fixer, same build, they both vats, the fixer guy dont stand a chance, take away vats and its a more even fight 
---
End result may be the same without vats, but there isnt much fighting chance with it imo
---
Besides VATS isnt the one feature that makes fallout, fallout
---
Yes, I'm almost getting to the point where I like it more than fallout 4 now. And think wastelanders if done right.... Will tip the scale massively.
---
But new Vegas is still my favourite fallout experience.....
---
Itadimashite and Amen :)
---
Have they set a hard date for wastelanders?
---
No, I believe its been pushed back to next year though as it was originally going to be before Christmas etc.
---
Someone might correct me on that.
---
Dont know if i have been lucky recently but charleston nearly always has 3*'s there
---
If they are using poison attacks, then the dataminers said that poison got buffed to every creature with the addition of Raids. Those poison attacks get me every time..
---
Any sense of roleplay implication was tossed out the window the second they put a crew in charge that didn't understand the importance of character names.
---
The devs working on this game have zero interest in or knowledge of Role-play.
---
I would love to be proven wrong but all the choices I have seen made since the beginning of this game and all of the crazy things they have done to the games sense of immersion tell me they just don't care.
---
I would very surprised to find out that a single one of the devs working this game play pen and paper RPGs at all.
---
Someone ages back suggested a secondary camp you could build \[they had a witty acronym for T.E.N.T if i recall\] that was a travelling camp of small radius and limits to just get a tent, bed, stash and maybe a single crafting station.
---
The idea being you'd pop this up while you were working a particular area far enough away from your home base that it made sense to set it up and you'd use it if over encumbered etc etc.
---
Anyways one of the many options this would add as well as another free travel point would be if your main base was unavailable you might still have the use of the smaller secondary.
---
Adding side camp configurations would just have people wanting to make different ones in all 3 locations and then whining that they couldn't etc i feel
---
Tbh even a boost to 9 dmg at the lowest would at least make it viable again
---
I let my newbie buddy know that until yourr 50 nothing matters as far as wepons and armor. Most people have 3 star legendaries, and their perk cards maxxed out AND ALL the mutations. You can even get lucky. like i build a heavy gun build, but i got one power fist that does 2x damage if target is at full health and it normally does like 400 and i dont have any cards invested in unarmed. But it does 800dmg for the forst hit and that insta kills  most things. Its all about what cards you mix with your mutstions and then finding that wepon that has 3 great effects.
---
The chances could just be low enough that it wouldnt matter if someone sat there for an hour. Maybe you could even pick select 2 or 3 settings to make the odds nearly impossible or pretty possible
---
Elaborate.
---
Why do people treat this game like an abusive ex lover? You lose nothing from coming back and trying it.
---
PS4 last night - All 3 packs gave me a legendary leader(9 scrip yay!).  
---
Then Wolf Horde spawned, alpha was not legendary.
---
Brilliant
---
 "Working as intended" - BGS, probably.
---
From what i know its 50 then 54% and exploding is clost to maybe 5 to 7% my AAE fixer with base 180 i believe does 8 to 12 with the 60% more explosive perk.
---
Depends on the number of players present as well. She gets buffs the more people are there. I do think you need to hit more than 1% tho in my experience. She was empty for me a few times when I was lower level despite cutting a decent chunk into her. Just have to keep at it. There are sometimes other 3* legendaries that spawn too so keep an eye out for those too.
---
We tried as best we could, poor cow in the wrong place at the wrong time. It eventually glitched and disappeared till at the scortched were gone
---
Well nasty comments like this from community members aren't exactly helping to convince me to come back.
---
I run a stealth sniper build and do a lot of one-shot mow-through.  No bloodied or junkie gear, just proper min/max perks and mutations.  My main is an instigating lever action while my secondary for heavier mobs is a furious handmade.  Neither one of those guns is perfect or really very good, both one-star.  My gear is a mix of chameleon and vanguard, so they don't really contribute to damage output.  Just wanted to post this to say that you don't necessarily need bloodied, junkies, or a specific legendary to kick ass.  Proper perks and play style can, for a lot of builds, get you pretty far.    
---
I would double check your build and compare it to others, make sure you've trimmed the fat, so to speak.  There's a lot of convenient perks I've given up for damage output, for instance.  And then of course like others are suggesting, take a look at weapons/gear.  Obviously a bloodied build is going to required bloodied weapons and most likely unyielding and/or PA.
---
I'd be checking the subreddit to see if my question hadn't been asked already.
---
Fast travel to a new location and back. That normally fixes it for me
---
On what specifically?
---
That it wasn’t built with roleplay in mind, or you think the devs are inept at this.
---
Yeah i dont see why he is even upvoted hes just plain wrong
---
have to claim a workshop with a pad, throw a flare, they show up eventually. it would be absolutely awesome. overencumbered travel. hell you could even have to be fuelled up with a core, it would be an awesome improvement
---
I mean, it’s basically the closest I get to Christmas for an adult.
---
Same boat! I hope there's not a line at the Purveyors shop by the time i get there.
---
Most cart owners in Skyrim have fantastic cart insurance.
---
I've only got 300 😒
---
have u noticed any difference bt'n playing high level mains vs younger alts?  anecdotally, i have farma pharma on almost all my ch's, but the delay in it "working" is huge bt'n the diff characters
---
Heavy weapons shine when paired with power armor, so invest a some intelligence in addition to strength
---
Bloodied builds are all the rage but some people are moving to junkies to offset the low health
---
BUT my # one tip for new players is to ENJOY BEING LOW LEVEL!  it is by far the most fun in the game, i miss those early days
---
dont try to power level, just take your time and explore!
---
I feel you on this. It is a breathtaking jump in the fallout universe complete with valid human reaction. I dont need Preston Garvey when I have Joe the high school kid who stayed up to late to try and find a legendary bloodied handmade. Asking me to save his common wealth. The joy of that serendipitous moment when a return customer comes to your shop to snag all your discount wares because he remembers you have the best prices on the server. The moment when you sneak up to someone in fort defiance and almost blow someone's head off because they snuck through the light in front of you.  Oh! Or the moments when you're just trying to find that damned terminal again and you hear an echo of, "is anyone in here!?!?"
---
You can imagine games that have stood the test of time. And a few of then at least,  buggy or not, are our favorites. We forget the times when the world we placed ourselves in  went smoothly, as that's just an un edged side of the abrupt issue of a bug or glitch. We all remember the good that comes with the bad. We can apply this to everything. 
---
It's like fighting the orgasm because we wish the good feeling not to end. Just let it happen and you can bust another nut in a couple of hours. Just let it go and give another shot later. 
---
76 is a turning point, an evolution. A mutation of the games we love exploring. Hand in hand, and pip-boys on our wrists we do this together, in Appalachia.  In west Virginia we ride. To hills and mountains of Shenandoah. Shes calling. Ease up and ride it out, steady as she goes my fellow brothers and sisters. Ride this out and we will not be tried in vain.
---
You are losing 10 scrip with either 2 or 3
---
People have a huge boner for talking about bloodied builds. You don't need bloodied to do high damage. I'm a Junkies Heavy Guns build on one character and I do insane DPS, without have to be below 20% health at all times.
---
Same. Wish I got more but couldn’t find cheap legendaries.
---
Must cost a fortune
---
Ah I just put the jet pack on an arm
---
You got my OCD brain scouring my post for a missed punctuation mark. Lol
---
Basically a bus.... I like it honestly. It also makes sense because in the airport the responders used, there was programmed drones that would visit the airport. And the vertibirds that guard that one drone that has the nuclear key card. Just have programmed vertibirds
---
How do you guys get this?Is it from a quest or an event?Or just a random drop?
---
Alpha spawns as a seperate horde event after you kill all 3 alphas and complete leader of the pack.  Horde bosses do not always spawn as legendary unfortunately.  I haven't run this in the last few weeks as its very low level and I like to leave it for the low levels instead of me just punching or gun bashing everything to death, however, I have gotten all 3 alphas and the wolf horde boss as legos in a single run.  It can happen, it just doesn't always.
---
i recently learned dailies actually reward scrip for completions, it is not announced on screen but they do show up in your scrip count!  The harder the area/region, the more scrip you get!
---
every bit helps!
---
The sound of chainsaws makes the scorchbeast just drop out the sky.
---
I wouldn't exactly call that nasty. My point is it's just a game and the essays people write about how they're thinking of trying it again aren't necessary. What will happen if you play it for a day or 2 and decide you don't like it. You've lost nothing.
---
Thanks dude! I am currently throughly enjoying the thrill of finding a level 5 hunting rifle so I can scrap it for mods. I love finding new locations and getting an event. Yesterday I had to sneak past a group of level 15 mirelurks at level 8 and it was so much fun.
---
Hm, i think the Gamma guns will become handy again with wastelanders and human enemies. At least that's what my Bloodied FFR gammagun hopes 😋
---
I know you can get it from a event. But I bought mine for a good price.
---
You sweet summer child....
---
You will experience only disappointment.
---
I also found a neat way to get cheap legendaries, if you do the "mob horde" events, but dont kill the final Alpha creature, the game keeps spawning in regular enemies, and it seem they have a pretty high chance of spawning in as legendary!  In one instance I got 4 of them in one event!
---
Shhh...  canning station will be 7 dollars.
---
Lol I think some of the lines are great. The protectrons at the wood place by 76 have my favorite ones.
---
Oh yeah. Sneaky crimes go unpunished as I still remember playing fallout and thinking: “dang, I really need those 3 caps from this guys nightstand,” even on my best characters.
---
If it's not AWS, it's running off an equivalent that isn't blocked in your county. My point is that they don't own and maintain their own server farms. It's all just rented cloud servers that turn on and off to match demand.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
I am over 600 at the moment. Shredded gear in my vendors that were not selling and doing events to get more. Seriously looking forward to the 50% sale.
---
Gonna be a lot of over encumbered players tonight.
---
after the nerfs, i finally got my first two-shot: a grenade launcher.  so, its toss grenade, fire weapon, 2nd thrown grenade, weapon's 2nd projectile hits.  Take that, single diseased radroach!
---
Except you’ll have to buy your cans from the atomic shop
---
My first argument would be the use of your account name for every character you have. This instantly ties your real identity to every single one of your characters, rather than allowing a developed character to build an identity for itself.
---
It is like we are all acting in a movie where all of the characters have names but we don't know them and we only know and use the names of the actors playing the character.
---
I can't think of a single RPG that doesn't acknowledge the character name. Hell even in fallout 4, one of the worst modern RPGs that godmods the hell out of you from the start they went to great lengths to acknowledge the character name.
---
I’d also like to see us able to use empty containers to gather water without getting rads like in fallout 4 survival.
---
Yes, Rad Rifles might actually have a purpose..
---
Don’t you mean go back into her fissure until November 1st?
---
Oh God, I hate those things. I respect them, cause they have little bodies and it's hard to hit one, but god damn they will get you
---
perfect for halloween!
---
Yeah, max lvl supposedly raises the bonus from 20% to 32%
---
Username checks out
---
Haha, I've been tempering my excitement too. I have visions of lots of heavy, nocturnal weapons....
---
If they can find it with all the excess noise.
---
This is actually a great idea!
---
I'm hoping it won't! I have hopes! And from a lore perspective, I don't understand it going from one to the other. I kinda perfered slapping pieces on and going my way without needing cores and all. I've gotten more used to it, and I only use my power armor for nuke runs and queen fights. I know it won't go back to the old ways, but I can dream lol
---
That's my plan during the event is to run around like this.
---
It should be unlocked by doing a quest not in the atom shop.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
New data is always available, I prefer that over flossing through old shit but you do you and I'll do me.
---
I’m an unhealthy level of excited for this

Leader of the pack. It spawns about every hour and drops a minimum of 3, 1 Star legendaries. It’s not much but it’s easy and quick. Then farm the Queen. Then Project Paradise, Son of Danes Event (which no one knows the actual name of for whatever reason), Campfire Tales, AWOL Armaments usually has a legendary or two.
---
The legendaries i get off those wolves is like 3-10 scrip if im lucky.  Not really worth..
---
I see what you mean, but I disagree. Role playing kind of always is an act. You’re never doing it unconsciously. You’re making decisions that your character would make, even if those aren’t the decisions you would make. I don’t think the name is that important to it. Generally RPG’s just don’t use your name, especially if you write something it’s not expecting. Also I don’t think it breaks immersion when swagdaddy69 is pretending to be a BOS paladin. We would never mistake him for an NPC, but we can still enjoy the fun of roleplay.
---
We're just asking Bethesda to implement things from past games when it comes to adding in npcs again lol
---
I thought it was a pretty accurate observation. I don’t understand how you see that as a “nasty” comment. It’s simple, if you want to try again then just pop the game in and try it out. Don’t ask reddit because there’s nothing that we can say that’s going to make you enjoy it. You’ll only know after trying it for yourself. 
---
Most of the people still on this sub and in game love the game so I’m not sure what you expect people to tell you. If you really wanted to come back then you would probably just do a quick google or YouTube search to instantly find what has changed instead of waiting to hear back from a bunch of people who you already know are biased and love the game.
---
They all add up.. gotta keep that scrip machine fed, have multiple toons to feed
---
It’ll probably roll over at 9PST when the atom shop updates
---
Hope she doesn't run out...I'm on holiday until Sunday
---
It spawns at a new event, Wolf Horde Forest.
---
That's probably the best build to start out with since it requires less legendaries because you must use power armor to get the most out of heavy weapons.
---
Bloodied heavy builds are actually viable because of the emergency protocols PA torso mod, which reduces all damage taken while below 20% health.
---
I suggest starting out with full health until you get the emergency protocols because it requires resources from end game gameplay.
---
Its a new dupe, the meat cleavers. Saw it yesterday being done by a low level, didnt register to me at first what was off about it. Realized way later that there was no lootbag and they were just dropping from that player.
---
Honestly at this point the chainsaw is all around a disappointing weapon, really hope it gets buffed soon.
---
those r  very good points.  i was amazed when codsworth called me by my childhood nickname: Mr. Fu\*kface.
---
Secondly, we have no ability to use custom emotes, and the few emotes that we do have are cartoonish, rigid, and immersion breaking due to a the impossible to remove floating icon.
---
Text chat has been commonly used in multiplayer games for RP since the days of 300 baud modems, yet this game launched without this feaure.
---
Yeah, I cant play with bad graphics. They were good for their time, and I can respect people who can go back and replay the games, but I'm just .. spoiled with today's graphics. In addition, fallout 3 also didn't have sprint and sprint is a big deal to me. I'm so used to it in every game. Another reason I cant go back and play the old halos. Walking is just..slow. 
---
I've learned that now when this big boy was running after me. Luckily, he apparently cant swim so he went back to his camp when I hopped in water
---
It's 3 for Forest, 3 for Toxic Valley, 4 for Savage Divide, 4 for the Mire, 5 for Camden Park for some reason and 8 for Cranberry Bog if anyone was wondering. That comes out to 91 scrip. Because of a bug, not every daily is available every day. But hey it helped me hit scrip cap!
---
It is only tangentially related, but the new [Inside the Vault article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more) just confirmed that Wastelanders has been delayed to 2020.
---
Ok, thanks. Weird, the Shop usually updates at 10am for me...Oh well, so long as it does eventually.
---
One violent night.
---
Oh that’s disappointing. I was thinking like... next month lol
---
One Violent Night is the Sons of Dane one. Several legendaries show up, but it's infamous for being popular with high level players who one shot everything.
---
Your name is the most important thing in rp imo.
---
That’s a tv issue for sure
---
Yeah my friend told me about it after. Are they only duping meat cleavers and nuke mines? Those are very common objects, doesn't seem useful. Or are they using that to dupe something else?
---
I've accidentally scraped stuff I wanted to keep because of the behavior you describe in the first paragraph.
---
Nope, not yet
---
I want this feature too, but I’d like them to improve stability by 500% first.
---
Well a youtube video wouldn't give me an idea f what kind of community the game now has.  After seeing the responses the answer is a definite no.
---
 Nuclear Winter is OK at best. I totally agree with OP here. The game needs to keep bringing out fresh quests and places to explore. After Wastelanders I wouldn't mind at all paying for new DLCs either, as long as the focus is right.
---
they're waiting for me.
---
Wait untill they'll fix that bug and cry when you loose armor piece😋
---
Vats is a core mechanic and it's part of cannon.  Removing vats is like removing power armor. It only serves to homogenize the game in an already over saturated generic fps market.  There are hundreds of other pvp based fps games out there without it if you dont like it.
---
Also, just my opinion here, vats isnt an "I win" button.  Maximizing its usage and getting around it's super easy counters is an artform all it's own and vats really does set FO apart from the crowd of other fps games.
---
Sad there's no news on the Steam release :(
---
Nope you don't need to run a bloodied build to one hit most enemies.
---
After reading this response I don't think you and I are taking about the same kind of role-play at all. 
---
Are you talking about single player RPGs? I am specifically speaking to multiplayer roleplay, be it tabletop or online. Single player RPGs barely have any actual roleplay to them.
---
Anti-armor becomes useless at high damage numbers ranging from 1k to 2k depending on the weapon used, so I suggest going with faster reload or larger magazines.
---
You can play around with this damage calculator to see if anti-armor is of any use: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
That’s nice but maybe do it like a pay 20 caps and get a chance at the price
---
I had no idea. I always skipped over that one cuz I was only doing wolf horde event for legendaries. Great to know tho.
---
Yes. Whatever bethesda needs to do to up stability by at least 500%, they need to do it. I don’t see how we’re supposed to keep playing though this lag.
---
You’ve summed up PVP for me. I love nuclear winter, but didn’t enjoy survival. It didn’t seem to really have a point to me. A faction based PVP with a real story would be awesome!
---
No other perks in agility directly add to damage output.  Reduced food weights means I can oft spam multiple foods and get passive buffs to perception/agi/luck, and in turn bump DPS.  It might be a matter of opinion but I see that as contributing to the min/max paradigm.    
---
Admittedly I don't use chems much so frankly I don't need those points in strength but, that is truly a matter of convenience I can't completely give up.
---
Don't listen to the people saying you need bloodied to one hit everything.
---
I understand that the event spawns but then it just disappears from the map
---
Completely surprised they're launching private worlds next week.
---
mayb the factions will just be like an opt-in pvp flag to keep that homeostasis of an always ol game.  just like, you come army-ing down here -- [no permits, no parley?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1i2ehskGUM)
---
Sleep! Being well rested gives an XP boost. You can sleep in your room in the vault and have the XP boost straight out of the gate. The church in flatwoods is good for this, and lots of players have an accessible bed. There are some foods that boost XP as well. One is the canned meat stew you get for the “Feed the People” quest, so I’d recommend doing that one whenever it’s available. Look at all the notes/terminal entries and listen to all the holos - lots of background stories relayed through those.  Enjoy exploring!
---
Yup. I have made a farming alt. Last night I had to do a double take, or triple to make sure I actually received my loot
---
Pretty bad on PS4 this last month or two, I thought maybe it’d get better with survival gone
---
43 mins from now is when they usually update
---
I’m approaching it from a single player POV because those are the RPG’s I’ve played. So if they’re significantly different, I may be wrong.
---
Don't be afraid to interact with other players. That held me back.
---
Having wastelanders delayed till early next year is a bit of a kick in the teeth but if its to better it and prevent it from being more of a buggy mess than expected from bethesda its a delay im willing to wait for
---
That works. I think a solution that means you don’t need that is that you no longer drop your items and you can’t have your camp destroyed.
---
That type of lag has increased gradually since Wild Appalachia started. Every week since wild appalachia started stability has gone down. Took a huge dive with Nuclear Winter. I don’t know what they need to do to fix it, but I hope they figure it out soon.
---
No mods though ☹️
---
Maybe I'm missing something, are you talkin about buying Atoms? If so it's always been like that, I myself choose to earn them rather than buy them
---
Same. You don't even have a character without it IMO. Even "the nameless one" would at least be an intentional character name, we don't even have that. 
---
I would prefer they just turned names off entirely so we could introduce ourselves.
---
I think people wanted to have access to the actual store and buy items through the site, not just atoms
---
Pretty bummed that you've got to pay for a private world.
---
Not surprised at all that they are charging for it.
---
Yeah but what the hell with the "purchase" part? And even more non-cosmetic atomshop stuff? I mean  good lord, these are not good news.
---
Riding a vertibird into battle with the Queen just sounds epic! [Ride of the Valkyries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCU0_QHUO-M) would be mandatory in such an occurrence
---
Yeah. My first interaction was with a level 236 and he somehow killed me? I’m really not sure. Anyways, this other level like 246 found out and came and swore the man out and gave me some mods and stimpaks and junk :) He was a real nice guy.
---
Text chat makes sense for PC, I can imagine it’s clunky for console though, and they want to Rely on mic options.
---
If you wanna change, it would be easier to start a new character as it would take a really long time to respect based on points because you can switch them only once per level.
---
RIP Wastelanders, I really hope it'll be super stable.
---
I've waited this long already, I can wait a little longer for flying thomas the tank engine mods server wide.
---
Gotta find someone to transfer some caps and my low level tse shotty then lol
---
It seems to be confirmed though that they will be paid, I wonder about the pricing. Also, the paragraph about the atom shop implies that the ammo and/or food converters are coming? Overall, it is a kind of a "bad news" article.
---
Multi star weapon with one effect being 250 DR while reloading?
---
I knew the delay was coming but i do like the idea of private servers
---
Continue.... imo. As you'll have selected some QOL perks that you won't have to select again.
---
Now just work round your existing build, start battering the weapons and armor for your new build and slowly start choosing the perks you need to swap over.
---
This is exactly what I did when I swapped from melee to bloodied rifle/commando. And it was so satisfying watching it all come together.
---
I was also about your level, I'm now level 292 and I still find new ways to improve my build after all this time.
---
Also looking forward to the sale. 1000 scrip at the ready, hoping to get my hands on another Ultracite GL, got a hunters I save for the queen and a mutants one for general work already. Furious or vampire I'd like if one drops.
---
I mean none of it really matters much, play how you want to play. PvE doesn't really require max DPS most of the time but your first sentence isn't exactly correct. You're only at rank 1 adrenaline. More DPS to be had there
---
Did you say it’ll cost money too?
---
“Our goal for players who purchase this service is to offer something for everyone, not just those who want a private server.”
---
I was also disapointed when i saw it couldnt be hung up in my garage.
---
Why wouldn't they...
---
[deleted]
---
I love having him around
---
😈
---
The atom shop comments really concern me. To everyone that argued repair kits and scrap kits wern't pay 2 win mechanic prepare to eat your words. Hope they don't ruin a great thing.  
---
Everything else looks good. I'm surprised to see the private world feature so soon, interested to see how that works.
---
Well considering "Most" private servers offered through other games cost money, I kinda figured it was implied.
---
Will it be a one time payment or like, renting a private world?
---
I have no problem with waiting, as long as it works.  I’d rather wait and have a game with no bugs then to have a game that is riddled with bugs that take away the emersion and make he game just a pain to play.
---
That was very entertaining. I like to imagine the mothman at the end was very disappointed in you both.
---
Thanks for the downvote though, it really adds to the conversation.
---
Not gonna lie this hurts. And having to “ purchase “ private severs is not gonna go over well.
---
It'd be nice if you can self-host on PC for free.
---
Which would be fine if we had a more robust emote system to control our characters. 
---
Although modern consoles mostly have the ability to use keyboards as well. 
---
Roleplay has traditionally been more of a PC and tabletop  thing anyway going all the way back to the beginning.
---
Im currently running a 2h build not one of those one shot rad builds haha, I use the armor that gives you more resistance per health status. That stats match power armor but at the end of the day I'm not seeing a difference.
---
&gt;Sure, you kill everything in one shot, but everything else can kill you in one shot.
---
Thank you for understanding this. 
---
This build is the only one thing that's  keep me playing this game. If it get nerfed I will leave Fallout 76 because this game is boring as hell after you reach level 100.
---
 Hi currently, I'm Dad!
---
You expected free?
---
I feel like the Two-Shot should be renamed Splintered. Bullet breaks apart causing 25% more damage.
---
It makes sense though.  Generate extra income and, if they were free, it would create nothing but exclusionary servers where we'd all lose random encounters with other players.
---
Yeah that'd be great. Feels like they've taken a leaf out of Microsofts book with the whole Minecraft Realms thing.
---
I didn’t vote anything almighty fortune teller.
---
Is anyone surprised?
---
&gt; purchase this service
---
If this turns out to be a subscription, then I say fuck Beth.
---
Not particularly that I prefer it per se, it's just an overall good weapon (bonus damage, DR, suppression) and is a good example of how gatling guns are just generally viable without being explosive. I also have an explosive ghoul slayer gatling and run 5/5 demo but I don't find the damage that much different.
---
So where is the release date?
---
I can confirm this but don't have a screenshot. I got my camera clipped under a frame once and saw the 76 number on the back.
---
I wonder how much private servers will cost.
---
 Our goal for players who purchase this service is to offer something for everyone, not just those who want a private server.
---
* \+250 Damage Resistance while reloading
---
* Damage increased after each consecutive hit on the same target
---
* 25% faster fire rate
---
It’s Bethesda.  Of course it’ll be rental.  Probably $9.99 a month, if they are feeling generous.
---
Fuckin brilliant
---
Why would it be free? When it's going to allow modding in the near future, how would they drive revenue from free private servers where no one would ever buy atom shop items when they can drop their own mods?
---
u/ladydevann does this count as this weeks ITV or should we still expect one highlighting patch 14?
---
Herbivore and carnivore are probably the easiest given yellowcake and fluorescent flux is the easiest to find imo
---
Yeah, pretty sure it's going to end up being a paid-for service where you effectively rent a server. On PC at least, it would be nice to have the option to self-host for free.
---
For me there is an hour difference, so 25 minutes ago the new daily challenges came up but the daily atom shop sale says “35 minutes remaining”
---
I mean i probably killed a couple hundred does that count
---
I’m in, gamer tag?
---
Only reason I'd refrain from starting a new main character is that would literally make all the 102 levels you've gained pointless..... And when legendary players come out you're going to regret starting again, because at level 100 you'll already be able to select 2 legendary perks (we don't know exactly how it's going to work but it's every 50 levels) just something to keep in mind.
---
I figured that was the request when it came to private servers. People wanted to reserve those random encounters to their select groups of friends, or just not have them at all for a peaceful game.
---
Yeah. For console players, I sort of get it. You can't host a server on a console, but that's pretty commonplace on PC. So, I hope there's at least an option. If there's not...I feel like there will be a mod for that.
---
Nah im excited too. But i got 5k script over 5 toons 😆
---
I'm personally more than happy to wait, and I'm fine with paid private servers since it's taking up lots of memory for something that will have less players than a usual server. Honestly? Not a single thing is making me annoyed here
---
If I recall correctly, it was confirmed last year that player hosted private servers (which could effectively make the game offline) will not be supported. Hopefully the pricing is reasonable, and it will be possible to pay with atoms, I have a few thousand saved up.
---
There pulling a ark. -_-
---
I've rented Ark and Rust servers before.  Buddies rented battlefield 3 servers too.  Its par for the course.
---
I mean, it's standard for all games that allow private servers that it's a monthly rental...
---
"While we had many ideas on what to add to the Atomic Shop... We heard from many of you who wanted items with some real utility."
---
Lol.
---
This will be this week's ITV.
---
I can't imagine that happening before Wastelanders does.
---
As a console player, I very much like to keep the game lol. Also the text box does seem immersion breaking. Far more than icons above someone’s head. That’s almost like... a video game given.
---
I’m a poor person with &lt;1000 caps most times.Cant think of buying anything for more than that.
---
I agree with you on core mechanic, and just in case I at some point was unclear, this discussion is just in pvp, vats in pve is welcomed with open arms
---
Anyway, I do get what you mean and yeah I can agree that removing it would make the pvp in this game closer to others (I still think fallout has some other things going on so personally I wouldnt mind removing it from pvp as already stated) but I also feel like I have no choice but to use vats when in pvp (at closer ranges that is) so no, maybe not a press to win, but I would deffo think of it as a press to give me a better chance at winning
---
Wow what a death blow. Pay for private servers? Adding (potentially) weapons and more utility items to the atom shop. So going full pay to win. No new content until March? Dead in the water
---
Your not wrong from that perspective, but multiplayer roleplay, where you are playing a role with others requires a more robust toolset to really pull off well.
---
Emotes are so essential, you really need a way yo describe what a character is doing in a way that the game wont let you.
---
Simple things like sitting down and cracking open a can of Cram cannot be done in the game and we have no way to illustrate to other players that it is happening right now.
---
I would have to physically speak over my mic "Nymith kneels down to tie the worn lacings on his boot, all the while continuing to ramble on" right now instead of illustrating this in a less intrusive way. 
---
Not to mention the response if I started talking like this in game chat would be "wut" because this game just doesn't encourage roleplay.
---
Havent looked into any recent patches or upcoming content. I stopped played just a few months past whitespring exp got nerfed.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

I’m betting I’ll get 1000 scrip worth of crap, at 50% off!
---
They all died at least 4 years before reclamation day.
---
I have an extra
---
I have a Vamp GL, and it is awesome. Good luck on your search today!
---
If private servers are next week, that means patch 14 then too?
---
Exactly. I hope this games survives the holiday season of new release games because this is a LOOOONG content drought.
---
It's "The Outer Worlds", then. Fine by me.
---
sorry, but it will be buggy mess even if release date is 2077.
---
who cares about bugs,they are only fun in this game at this point.
---
#nohate
---
Most games do this? Did you honestly think it was gonna be free lol?
---
Normally you hire private servers so this isn't surprising.
---
I think Sunday is the last day of the sale, so you should at least be able to spend whatever scrip you already have saved up.
---
I'm guessing no matter what they say, you'll come to the same conclusion.
---
Man I feel like a good hunk of this is bad news...
---
Why the hell wouldn't private servers be purchased? You think you should be able to own your own server for free?
---
Also, january and february are also Q1
---
You and just about everyone else. Nice work!
---
All xp got nerfed tbf lol but if you run full Unyielding armor and have egg head you can get your intelligence close to 30 and you'll get mad xp like all us bloodied builds.
---
Even at level 292 I get a level every day if I play for only an hour a day and actually go out hunting.
---
Q1 2020
---
Gives me time to level my gunslinger, so I'm alright with it. 🙂
---
I think I own 2 1* vampire Gatling lasers. Do you happen to be on Xbox? I’d be happy to sell you one for a very fair price.
---
This is basically worst news possible on all fronts
---
so nothing else this year and they are gonna try and compete with all the real hotness dropping in Q1 next year? RIP
---
Lol I must not be the only one who translates “more fun” this way.
---
Because people like you have no sence of value for your money.
---
Yeah, it sucks.  On the other hand, I was already unsure how I'd juggle Wastelanders, Modern Warfare, The Outer Worlds and Death Stranding all at once.  Now I'm good there 😁
---
It will be nice to have time to give Outer Worlds a proper playthrough. I was worried Wastelanders would arrive November 1st out of nowhere somehow and make me rush it.
---
Yes, we're currently targeting Patch 14 release on Wednesday, October 23.
---
Would it not be worse if they rushed it and it came out extremely buggy? Lmao
---
I mean this is standard for private servers so i don't understand why you think this is an issue
---
I'm sorry man, i don't really feel like doing all that. just use photo mode to clip through the fusion core hole on the back. The guy at the entrace of fort defiance is good for this.
---
I'd like to play Junkie but it has pretty poor QoL at the moment with the lack of favorites space or inventory organization. I have no room for the chems I'd want to use often.
---
It certainly ups the ante for them and our expectations.
---
**did you guys know you can go here:** [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and set up / share your character builds I do it all the time to see what would increase my damage / abilities
---
It does look possible that there will be some controversy, not least since private servers will be required for "official" mod support, so I can see people considering that effectively paid mods.
---
Haha, my favorite part will forever be myself actually taking my time to swap cards, and guy just fast travel out of there, it was like the least threatening situation of all time
---
agree to disagree.
---
im also ok with a delay, in fact i thinks its best if Beth realizes its not ready!
---
im proud of them actually
---
Well this is some bad news, I am pretty much out of content to play. The only challenges I have left are ridiculous or bugged. I have the gear I want. Not sure what else to do will we wait for Q1 2020.
---
Releasing paid for private servers would kill my hype for this wastelands update
---
Yeah considering already dropped $60 on base game why the hell would I pay more for a super basic mode that should have been in the launch?
---
I could understand buying mods, they've been doing that for years. Private sessions, no way.
---
Dang, you're on pc?
---
Awesome, finally a story!
---
The most immersive multiplayer RPGs that exist online are entirely text based. MUDs/MUSH have been plenty immersive for decades.
---
Books have existed far longer, just sayin.
---
The vast majority of games charge you to host a private server
---
Well that’s disappointing. Time to wait 3+ months I guess
---
most corpses you find are several years old by the time you get there. Pretty much all the corpses in the cranberry bog part of the map are from 2095-97, madigan died some time after 2095 but most likely not in 2100+, the responders were wiped out in late 2096.
---
Honestly there are 2 bodies I can think of that shouldn't be completely decomposed at this point, and those are the ones of the tourists who give you the camera.
---
how mature
---
Yeah the Delay sucks but if it needs more time it needs more time.     Curious to see how the private servers will work and if it will help with latency and all that.  Only other thing is the said last week they would talk about patch 14 this week and there was nothing in that "Inside The Vault" that even talked about it.     Only other thing i got is what happens after the Halloween Event.   What is their for content?  is there nothing planned untill Q1?    Which if i learned anything over the last couple years from company's means March.
---
You need unyielding armor, a full set. Drugs arent gonna do that much. With a full set of unyielding armor, and the radicool perk, your strength will be at 40. This is why unyielding is absolutely necessary for bloodied melee. 
---
1.Unyielding armor
---
2.Adrenal reaction mutation
---
3.Other melee mutations
---
4.Nerd rage and radicool perks(when your high enough level)
---
Those are all way more important, and with these you wont even need a bloodied weapon to one shot most things. If your struggling at low levels take chems you find, but theres no reason to spend time farming chems.
---
The unyielding will add 15 to intelligence as well, which makes you level up faster. Grab any piece of low level unyielding gear, players sell 1 stars for cheap and you dont need all those fancy other effects yet, wait till your leveled and buy/find a ballin level 50 unyielding set later on.
---
Is Patch 14 coming next week? It's been like 6 weeks since a patch.
---
This is fucking standard. Literally 99/100 games offering private servers charge.
---
I'd rather them say "Yeah we delayed Wastelanders, here's something else to do!". I just feel there's a bit of a content drought at the moment.
---
No, PS4
---
It's funny to see people think it's the end of the game because we haven't heard anything about Wastelanders.
---
Then we hear about Wastelanders, and people think it's the end of the game. 
---
And I'm guessing when Wastelanders is released, they'll think it's the end of the game.
---
Or maybe bring back some special penalties for levels of radiation poisoning. If someone's on death's door from radiation sickness, they probably aren't going to be at full strength.
---
What did you expect ?
---
Yea this has me a bit more hype tbh. Seems like a good time to take a break.
---
LOL
---
The images they posted for wastelanders looks SICK. I'm really bummed it's been delayed but it's obvious they're completely reworking the game. Hopefully it will be (at least 50%) bug free.
---
This is basically all bad news but it is being presented like we should all be really happy and exited.
---
Eh I guess honestly I don't mind switching between games depending on the mood I was just hoping for something new that'll stick around longer than a week in game. They could release Vault 96 to tide some of us hardcore players over at least
---
They should focus on adding things that can be earned in game instead of majority of the things, especially with utility, going to the Atom Shop.
---
Glad I preordered RDR2
---
Well I mean I guess I shouldn’t expect it to be free but considering all the bs over the year and it more than likely not being a one time purchase, it’s just kind of a punch in the nuts. I get your mod reasonings. I was thinking more of hosting your own so I guess I’m wrong there. Anyway, this along with their atomic shop and challenge changes sound like some money grabbing scheme brewing (more than usual).
---
Today I learned that two months is "long term."
---
Welp, so just unyielding and egghead? Do I have to high rads?
---
You know I'd say you're right, but when I posted about this, everyone told me I was crazy. But then of course like a week later people were crying about how "they were promised" private servers and I tried correcting them. Saying they were never promised, but they were probably coming soon cause Survival was leaving, but I was also told I was crazy for that too. 
---
This sub has become just as of not more toxic than the regular Fallout sub. No matter what you post you get down voted.
---
Paying for servers is standard, but yeah the rest sounds like bad news.
---
Yeah but I doubt q1 next year means January or February given Bethesda track record and March is dangerously close to cyberpunk 2077, dying light 2 and Bethesdas own already delayed doom eternal
---
i feel like you misread my comment
---
That is what they want. They are upset they might have to wait a few more months to post complaint after complaint. Or worst of all it might come out half decent and they won't be able to complain.
---
oof the only cosmetics promise is officially dead i guess
---
I would have worked on your English more here
---
I don’t think they will ever add weapons. That would go against the principles they outlined in the article. More utility, yes unfortunately.
---
Wastelanders delayed.  The full admittance they are abandoning the promise of cosmetic only.
---
Nothing shocking here.
---
&gt;  They could release Vault 96 to tide some of us hardcore players over at least
---
I've got a feeling they probably will. based on the wiki the missions are already done anyway
---
I knew it would be deleayed.... just not to Q1! I really dont know I will be able to keep playing until Q1... You better add new raids (withou timer and checkpoint) and events... Alot of people will leave... Also I dont know what you read but the utility items are pissing people of... give us a missions and sell us skins like the backpack!
---
The Community challenges have a chance to fill in, along with holiday events they’re dropping in. Private worlds may help ease the tension on 94’s pool of hate. Can we get fasnacht again❤️
---
PAID PRIVATE SERVERS ARE STANDARD
---
Good for them for delaying it. Rushing out an unready product to meet some pre-set release date is exactly what caused so many of the game's existing issues. Get it right to begin with because you'll never have that kind of time to fix it once it's live. 
---
Is anyone surprised that private servers will have a cost? They're not free for Bethesda to provide so I wouldn't expect them to foot the bill for hosted server resources. While it would be nice if they released the server-side code for players to host truly private servers, it's not realistic to think that will happen in the foreseeable future. I'll wait to see what the cost is before deciding if I hate it or not. I can't be mad at charging something for it, though.
---
Literally 99/100 out of those games also give you the option to self host for free.
---
True, but I was always going to have to reevaluate my life when Cyberpunk 2077 and Final Fantasy 7 remake hit next March / April.
---
It’s pretty standard for games to rent private servers monthly, specially with mods it’ll make the atomic shop kinda pointless for many
---
What about a pickling station to pickle stuff too?
---
Bethesda: "The Atom shop is purely cosmetic!"
---
Bethesda 5 minutes later to no ones surprise: "The atomic shop could maybe have stuff with some game play help"
---
Bethesda next year: "Atom shop only bloodied two-shot anti material rifle"
---
You expect them to run a private server for you AT THEIR EXPENSE??  That's fucking stupid, and any expectation for them to go out of pocket for you to have a private server then you're delusional.
---
Q1 isnt a great release time next year either, theres alot of really potentially amazing games in Q1 2020.
---
Or maybe just recipes/plans to use at the cooking station or tibker bench?
---
&gt;  To everyone that argued repair kits and scrap kits wern't pay 2 win mechanic prepare to eat your words. 
---
HOLY WILD SPECULATION BATMAN
---
Unfortunately Bethesda can't win in this situation. Delaying is the right thing to do but most won't see it that way. I'm confident they are doing the right thing even though it's dissapointing.
---
in your setting make sure "pacifist" mode is set to ON then you wont be able to hurt other players and they cant hurt you!
---
 Hi confident, I'm Dad!
---
Only reason we run high rads is so when we heal we don't come out of nerd rage threshold, it's not essential but it makes running low health Unyielding builds so much easier.
---
Fyi each point of intelligence adds 2% xp.... Also always be well rested, and if you ever see the event feed the people go and join in for the canned meat stew reward which gives another 5% xp.
---
Cranberry relish I believe is also a craft able food item for a further 5% xp although I never bother with it.
---
Who needs private servers.... It's ONLINE game...
---
I forget, didn't they give a ballpark release date for this a loooong time ago?
---
While I agree it will hurt the game, releasing yet another buggy dlc / patch would (especially one so hyped as the big good thing) would be worse. 
---
Better bad press from delays and then boom a near bug free awesome release that surprises everyone than an on time drop that is terribly broken, surprises no one and takes three more months to fix anyway.
---
This has been the norm for huge worlds since Battlefield 3 tho
---
Huh, sounds like in order to mod we will need to pay for a private server. That's uber lame. But I get it. 
---
And the atom shop is just going to get BetTeR UtiLity. I'd put all my caps on the ammo converters coming out with update along with other no cosmetic items for the "rework". I remember seing the posts about the refrigerator, scrap kits and what have you. People wanted them implemented, not paid for. But again, sadly, I get it. 
---
How this next update goes will make or break this game. Fingers crossed that it goes well. Glad they pushed it back to make it more polished.
---
Yea, they said end of 2019
---
If you expected private servers to be FREE then you're delusional.  There's no reason they should expect to give you a free private environment that they have to host on their servers out of their own pocket.
---
If Wastelanders is perfect on release then fine, delay it, but we all know for a fact its gonna be unstable and the delays will get hate.
---
As for private servers, if they're not stable then no-one will buy one and without mod support its a hard sell at the moment because of how laggy and unstable the official servers are.
---
Armor pen ;)
---
Rifleman is pretty bad too in my opinion, too slow to shoot.  And idk why you're outside of power armor if you're wanting to use Heavy Weapons, you're just losing Stabilized and it's 45% armor pen.
---
If you run a B25 Handmade and have adrenal reaction, set yourself to 20%, you'll have about 250 damage I believe.  I walk up to the vast majority of people and hit 110 with every shot, except for the occasional heavy combat Ass. Sent. guy.
---
I was worried that we were going to get wastelanders this year. Glad they delayed. 
---
Also I was hoping they would double down on functional items in the atom shop. 
---
I’m a little disappointed it sounds like they may make new challenges and ways to earn atoms. 
---
I wish they put off private servers. I liked reading people beg for them constantly. 
---
/s
---
Im sorry have those games been bashed to death since birth? I dont care what others do... This game does not need another paywall.... in 6 months Ill be paying for Ammo Bags in the Atom shop.... need 1000 5.56? 100 atoms.
---
I really hope so man I've been mulling about in full strangler and solar gear in game just waiting for the next challenge lol I've even been traveling to vault 96 looking for subtle changes to the exterior for a clue to see if it may be coming soon lol I'm jonesing for some content
---
If it means it gets better I dont mind
---
Yea I kno they have to charge for it to work but some ppl won’t like that plus the content drought.
---
Given the difficulty of the event, and the need for some players to prep for it, I'd like to see a countdown timer for it (if it's going to stay on a cooldown rotation). 
---
Just a public announcement that "PP can be activated in 5:00 minutes" or something. If I know there's a possibility of being able to start it up, I might not go do something else. It would also give a bit more time for mid-level players to prep themselves.  
---
Anything which might increase the number of people on the event should be a good thing.
---
Only melee food stack.  So you can't say do a deathclaw steak and deathclaw wellington because they are both Strength.  You also could not add a drink version of the food for Strength either, it would cancel out the deathclaw wellington.
---
&gt;Join us again next week for a few highlights from the upcoming patch and the final progress update for Project Clean Appalachia.
---
So this was a lie? Can you at least tell us if the Patch 14 release is next week or the week after?
---
That's fine, go ahead and compete with CyberPunk 2077. I'm sure people will pick your update over that game. 
---
I get Beth needs the time... and they need to knock it out. But now the hype I've had for this update is gone and I dont feel like I'll log back in anytime soon. 
---
I'm sure when I come back, the playerbase will be smaller, angrier, and obviously more thrilled about these utility items. Beth knows thier audience
---
The post basically hints at paid guns in atom shop mark my post it will happen. Don’t worry they will be guns that don’t disrupt the meta or can not be used in PVP or something. Hohoho.
---
I run a low health high rad build, usually 40/60 health/rads. My strength between 6a-6p is 29 with all my unyielding armor and such. My bloodied pole hook does between 650-1100 damage. My bloodied gatling plasma does around 200 damage, I only use that on the queen tho. My carry weight without power armor is between 405-425. Downside is I can’t take a lot of damage and use alot of stimpacks.
---
What I am trying to say is content that lasts for more than a week, ie: events.
---
What convience item??
---
&gt;Our approach to these items at launch was to keep them purely cosmetic. But after looking at all the data, it became clear
---
Not really speculation after a comment like this... I just hope they don't take it to far. I don't want another good game ruined.   
---
If you want speculation we will probably see fast travel passes all the way to weapon mods (I hope not)
---
Op is overreacting
---
It does suck we have to wait but in January this year  I thought the game was dead and boom, we got the new map of releases. I'll be busy eith Outer Worlds so its a little bit ironic lol
---
9.99 a month, thats how it will work
---
I saw the delay coming from a mile away, there’s just too many other problems to ignore before adding in update that’s supposed to basically reboot the game. However, there is a severe lack of content that’s already taken it’s toll on a majority of the community, including most my friends. They’ve been spending their time with Monster Hunter, and honestly at this point I can’t blame them, Beth is new to this online experience but they definitely need to step it up with the smaller the smaller events like Meat Week, Halloween, etc. if they want to keep the game fresh for the dedicated players.
---
I started grabbing some of the perks. For the unyielding what stats are priority? Or would a 1* unyielding be alright ?
---
Since it's a business I expect money grabbing - my chief complaint is the huge lack of value for that money grabbing. 
---
I expect private servers to have an associated monthly fee and knowing their thought process it's probably a line of logic that includes "how much should we charge a month that could be spread among 24 players?" I'm thinking $50+ a month. If it's under $10 I'd be surprised.
---
It's 100% the right thing to do but I'm not sure it can afford the delay. This news is gonna be a haters dream unfortunately.
---
I havent played in 2 1/2 months (long vacation) but next week im going to dive in. Im sure i missed tons of stuff
---
My problem also
---
*Sigh* The only thing I had to look forward to in this game got delayed. Say it’s because of bug fixes sure but given the state the game launched and in some cases remains. I find it more likely they just can’t even get it to work in the first place.
---
Such a shock that cash flow is required to continue hosting and developing. This is an outrage!
---
With rdr2 coming to pc in a couple weeks I'll probably take a month break from the game or so. Did the same when i got AC Odyssey and AC Origins on sale last winter/spring
---
Where’d you get the mask?
---
Apparently the sales numbers have shown that enough don't care to move forward.
---
Smh. 
---
You act as though this was planned. Sure they never gave a concrete release date but the mere fact they say it's a delay means they planned on it before Q1. 
---
And now you want them to pull a huge update out of there ass. Especially after they "were focusing on wastelanders after shutting down survival"
---
I agree that this delay is going to hurt them in big ways but thinking this was deliberate or that they can magic a big update out in place of it is ridiculous.
---
That’s my plan, thanks for the confirmation on the perks.
---
Aslong as ita out before cyberpunk. If after then ill proably get back into it next winter. Kinda sucks but still loving the game for what it is atm.
---
Yup. +250 DR is the cause. Known bug, once you reload until you weapon off then back you “lose” the Primary (Furious)
---
Happens to any weapon with +250DR ability. 
---
I have a very similar weapon.
---
They want you to double dip so you won't know until it's very close. I'm guessing a soft relaunch after wastelanders. Kinda like what Rockstar does but shittier because it's the same game   on the same platform (pc)
---
You mean special?
---
Depends what weapons you're planning on using and how you want to play?
---
Obviously stealth commando, or stealth/melee are the "META" which is a term I hate.
---
Yea, beyond nuclear winter, the bulk of content came in wild Appalachia, so there will basically be an entire year of no big content
---
So you are complaining about something that isn’t even visible without clipping through and bugging the game?
---
What happens in the actual game if your power armor breaks? The frame is revealed right? Isn’t this an ok enough explanation? If they actually hve 76 jumpsuits on... I don’t see the big deal as the only way you would even see that is through an exploit lol.
---
I don’t wanna be cynical but I feel like Beth knew half of us are gonna play TOW so they figured why not delay wastelanders to make it extra polished since half the player base will be gone anyway.
---
Q1 stretches until April or May so it could be 6 months at the latest
---
A bit late there
---
No, I kind of expected to run our own private server, like most multiplayer games allow, for free..
---
To be fair... I didn't downvote you, I sarcastically (out of frustration towards the game) snapped off on you. And this sub has been toxic for a long time... it's even effected me.
---
Same here.  I have 1,000...and will end up with a ton of crap!  I thought about loading my mules up too, but they are low level, and I didn't want a whole bunch of low level crap on top of this crap.
---
At this rate they should have just made the game free. Why did they make me pay full price for a game if I need to keep paying forever to play?
---
Valseek already replied in the thread.  It's releasing on the 23rd.
---
For me it wouldn't be an issue when they had announced it as an subscription from the start. Then I wouldn't have bought the game at all.
---
If it's sold as an addon, then I'll buy it with a one time fee, but not with recurring payments.
---
Any game based on subscriptions is a no go for me, more so when the publisher wants to double dib my wallet. Once for the game itself and then to keep on playing.
---
And here I have the well founded fear that Beth is not able to stop cheating on modded servers (their cheat detection is laughable) and then player taking their cheated toon/gear back to adv or nw.
---
Yeah I've revisited SWBattlefront2 recently and am gonna bleed Outer worlds dry before I come back to 76 hoping there will be a sizable chunk of content to come back to by then
---
Jesus man, I was just venting some frustration. I also didn't say anything about them wanting to pull an update out of their asses. I want the update and the game to succeed as much as anyone else.
---
Wow. You're so special. I'm surprised you haven't won the lottery with those super powers.
---
Well, I haven't been hitting 1k consistently. I have a 2 star Instigating limb damage as well, but was annoyed by the limitations of having to make the first hit and thought that the crit damage would be more versatile.
---
Not even a little bit surprised.
---
Either heavy guns or rifle. Not into the meta just wanna have fun.
---
Hey if we going there I want the lvl 50 welding mask from nuclear winter in adventure mode
---
Will they finally start adding mods with the private servers?  Do the private servers cost anything or is it just a solo game?
---
Amen. Already preordered The Last of Us 2. Can't wait
---
None of those items were ever pay 2 win... a B2525 handmade would be P2W. What you're thinking of is pay for convenience which at best can probably give you &lt;1% advantage
---
its gonna be subscription based isnt it? Also disappointed with the Wastelanders delay... i hate to be negative but no delay is going to stop a lot of those bugs from getting through. this IS Bethesda.
---
I almost died at the hands of a Scorchbeast yesterday.  Luckily, I had my pay-to-win refrigerator there on me.  I chilled some steaks really quick, which gave me a full HP meter plus 200% damage, and took the Scorchbeast's HP down by 30%.  It also killed every other human player within a quarter mile radius.  I took all their loot bags once I finished off the SB.
---
So glad I paid to win!
---
The vast majority of games let you host your own for free
---
Reading that over again, I think they’re going to break up what you can spend “free atoms” on. Like sure you can get atoms for challenge but they won’t be good for “utility” stuff. Their way of saying woah people want these things and they won’t be getting them for free anymore.
---
I'll be moving on.  After 535 levels, I think it's time for this old cowpoke to check out Borderlands 3 and the Outerworlds.  I'm not angry, but today's news just sort of threw a giant blanket of "bleh" over the bit of enthusiasm I had left for this game.
---
hahaha i mean i'm sorry.... but 1 year since release and the game is still like this? the biggest update we were supposed to get is now delayed? private servers are going to cost money?
---
how are people still excited about this shit?  
---
i love fallout so much but damn....
---
The article explains it all.
---
Fine with me. I think all of the "pay to win" stuff is overrated.
---
The "pay to win" scrap bots bring in a tiny fraction of caps worth compared to water purifiers.
---
The "pay to win" scrap kits are easily obtainable from SBQ. I use them to repair all of my gear and still have an abundance of them without ever spending an atom on them.
---
The "pay to win" refrigerator is useless when I've survived on nothing but Halloween candy for 11 months. I have 24k Halloween candy sitting on my mule atm and I never run out on my main.
---
Only 43 days after patch 13... I hope it's a doozy!
---
Have gotten 30 - 35 plus 3* ranged weapons from purveyor since I got the fixer plan.  Total number of fixers gotten from mole mama... 0.
---
To be fair, i would love my anti material rifle back.
---
That's exactly what Bethesda wants you to think. They've conditioned you to think that p2w means winning at pvp, but that's not how it's defined.
---
Okay, I honestly don't give a damn whether you come back to play or not (not sure why I should), so I'm gonna be real with you like I am with the people who ask this question every day on this sub. Less than 2/10 people who replied to you said something that wasn't nice. They weren't even what would be considered mean comments. If you want to cry about people being real with you then that's fine with me and the community is probably better off with less people who think that way. We've been drowning in these types of personalities.
---
You're acting like a white mom who calls the cops because people aren't treating you the way you like. In the real world, you'll be really lucky to find 8/10 random strangers will answer your questions nicely in your preferred manner. Grow up. Just because 2 people out of tens of thousands tell you what you're not wanting to hear, you're going to assume the whole community is bad. This game has the best video game  community I've ever been a part of.
---
Was the last atom bundle that ended on the 9th of this month.
---
I can imagine that releasing private servers now serves to reduce the number of people leaving. With the lack of major new content for months, there is at least a new way to play the game. And with only 1 to 4 players on a private server, those may also have less issues with lag and instability.
---
I think you missed the point on the atomic shop so this is as clear as I can make it, we do Not want to pay for functionality items, we are ok with skins/cosmetics but functionality is not a thing we like, we would prefer if items were given if they have functionality as it’s easier to recommend the game without anything like that around
---
I aint paying for a private server...
---
Plus you can get the atom shop items for free by playing.
---
if private servers are coming so soon.... how about a price?
---
SBQ doesn't give scrap kits. It gives repair kits. Scrap kits are not obtainable in any way in game.
---
Nowadays on console you can plug in a compatible keyboard or use an official chatpad. As long as the game allows it of course.
---
Haven't played NW in about a month. Maybe I should give it a shot again. But last time I did I was murdered by the same guy 4 games in a row flying 200ft in the air 1 shotting the entire sever. 
---
Truly hope they have at least something come by in the mean time other then the short Halloween event. If they dont have any conent drops they hopefully at least start pushing fixes for some of these year + old bugs now.
---
I am pretty much done gathering gear, finished the quests and only have bugged challenges left to do, I really need some new content to keep me entertained. Also worried my group will move on and not bother coming back. Lost half my regular gaming friends after the first 6 months, a few came back to prepare for Wastelanders but I think they will move on to something else instead.
---
To each their own I suppose. Each .50 cal bullet hits for around 70 dmage, and 20 explosive id say on average, and the fire rate of it surpases any rifle, which is what counts. And I'm not in PA cause there's no point to gain 45% armor pen just to lose assassins/sentinel/AP refresh. My full health commando does 110 damage per hit as well mostly.
---
I meant repair kits.
---
You get scrap kits from vault 94, right?
---
That’s not such a bad idea. Encrypted gives you 9 minutes before you need to recall the bot which usually  gives the server plenty of time to get there. Even when I have a group with me I let that timer run for like 5 minutes so players I don’t know have a chance to come to the event.
---
Huh. So farm queen for months, continue avoiding raids because I never seen anyone doing them, avoid that arktos place because its always empty ... or farm.plastic in the high school? Plastic.
---
Stonks.
---
I arrive at today's first server, there's a scorched officer right behind me.  
---
I shoot him for 400+ dmg, it doesn't register. I shoot him again while he is in the air and he dies, but still somehow manages to hit me while being dead.  
---
"Great start". I proceed directly to the nearby Encryptid event and activate it, using my 1750 caps key card, pop a psychotat in inventory &amp; the game crashes on me.
---
And now it's obvious that Bethie very much would like some more money from me? Even hinting at future paid updates?    
---
This is just unbelievable.
---
Press will pick on Atom shop declarations and payed private server.
---
Yes, Defiance fell in '95 and all the others died or left within a year after that.
---
Oh you mean like the repair kits which aren't p2w?
---
Or the scrap kits that aren't p2w?
---
Or do you mean the fridge which isn't p2w?
---
Or maybe you mean the collector which isn't p2w?
---
Just watch John Wick and you'll be ready to fix things lol.
---
Forget the actual pay to win thinking, it’s going to be pay to buy them period. I think that’s what they’re referring to with the atomic shop changes. I bet you won’t be allowed to use free atoms from challenges on those “super popular utility” items anymore.
---
lots of people on this sub are. i can't imagine thinking that someone buying a refrigerator or a robot is somehow "paying to win".
---
Hey Dad 👊
---
Same thing with selling.  It likes to jump around.
---
is/was that a thing?
---
Roadmaps, unresolved bugs and issues, push towards less cosmetic and more utility items, community complaints about top tier item availability/drop rates, continued server issues, delays to things on roadmaps... it’s all starting to look a bit ‘Anthem’.
---
Is there going to be a weapon balancing patch soon atleast? Like buffing the weapons that are often requested? There was supposed to be one before wastlanders, but with it pushed back to q1 that could be quite a while yet. There are some weapons that need some love to help promote a variety of builds and uses. Please!
---
Oh this makes me very unhappy. I’m sick and tired of constant hype and promises then they just say sorry not ready just before content drops and we have to wait months again. Unacceptable. Their roadmaps are just a constant joke. I got people to buy the game and talking about how great wastelanders will be, not I look like a fool.
---
The thing I've noticed is that majority of PvPers who do videos don't do good PvP. Yeah they rock some noobs, but majority of material I've seen, people were either resorting to lowly tactics or been freefrags - the level of masterfullness I see fighting some of my opponents vastly surpasses what I've seen recorded.
---
Generally speaking in VATS based combat jumping in place is pretty efficient, but can be countered by first bursting the target with appropriate highstagger weapon, breaking the chameleon effect and then VATSing the target in the short period they can be targeted. You are required to burst through manually, time things right and then spellcast the VATS criticals to ignore enemy defensive spells.
---
My take: free atoms from challenges won’t be good to buy those “high demand” utility items anymore.
---
What's going to hurt Bethesda the most is having this delay, so they can smooth out Wastelanders, only to have Wastelanders be a buggy mess. It's an unfortunate reality
---
I wonder how much they'll charge for servers. Kind of put me off right there. I've paid enough for the game and some Atoms, I no longer wish to pay for more.
---
Then don’t
---
What about now? Check the inside the vault
---
True, you just have to pay 9.99 a month for that lagless experince :)
---
No wastelanders until 2020, expected but disappointing.
---
"purchase" private servers. What the fuck?
---
Further monetization of the Atom Shop. &lt;headshake&gt;
---
It's really getting hard to keep playing this game.
---
Really worried about the wording about changing the Atomshop. It should enhance the game not be the basic of it. 
---
When they added wallpapers I was really surprised the whitesprings didn't also sell a couple of kinds. It really was a great addition but only for Atomshop goers? That doesn't seem right.
---
I would love to have more items as quest rewards, like the backpack, why couldn't the collectron be a rewards for a quest about designing a scrap robot that has you hunt down multiple dangerous robots? And have skins for it in the Atomshop?
---
Delaying Wastelanders to the next decade is sad, but probably worth it? I mean it only really puts more pressure on the devs, if it is by release really buggy and unstable what was the delay for?
---
I mean, their pocket is filled with *our* money, so I wouldn't say I'm delusional. I've already payed for this game 3 times over in atoms, but I do get your point. I've never played a game with a private server, and it's not something I would do. I don't play MMORPGs to play alone, so I'm not sure what's standard. I guess someone who isn't used to paying for games many times over for content won't like the idea.
---
Ha I called it, next year
---
For PVE and non-melee it’s a bloodied single shot rifle build all the way
---
Get a nice lever action
---
Stack as many rifle perks as possible, adrenal reaction and sneak bonus and it’s an easy +1200 a shot.
---
Alright Alex Jones, next you're gonna tell me they're putting sugar bombs in the water to turn the friggin radtoads gay
---
 Hi delusional., I'm Dad!
---
Heavy guns is difficult with Unyielding, because you can't be stealthy while firing an unsilenced gatling plasma 😂 and you'll die a lot running at 20% health. 
---
So I would recommend stealth rifle, your extremely high agility and sneak rank 3 make you almost undetectable even while basically touching most enemies (in my experience because this is how I play) I also use escape artist, because all you have to do is sprint a short way once in danger and go back into sneak and you'll be in caution again 9/10.
---
Seriously this almost seems like meme material.
---
This is my experience, I didn't even reply the previous because it didn't make sense to me
---
Yeah pay to win confirmed and more ways to get ppl money with the "private servers" subscription thats their only effort so far they can't even solve a bug i reported 3 weeks ago greed is killing bethesda.
---
I'll just be happy where I can play on a world where I know for certain no one's touched all the shit in every location so I can properly explore. But hopefully we'll see some mods soon enough.
---
You're awfully optimistic.
---
I wont. I dont support this.
---
It's kinda cool how the 23 is the day the bombs dropped and they day a patch is released. Is there going to be a weapon balancing patch soon? Like showing some love to weapons that need it? Like the single action revolver,chainsaw, ripper etc...?
---
$9.99 a month wouldn't be that bad if it had other features. More like ESO plus.
---
&gt; The "pay to win" scrap
---
I think you mean repair
---
scrap are even more useless
---
Well you can pay for the privilege
---
Yea it's pretty obvious at this point anything useful from now until wastelanders will be payed for with atoms.
---
The article was fine, until you get to the part from the atomic shop, and u suddenly realize that they might had hired an EA employee to write this shit. It almost shamelessly sais that we are adding p2w items because ya'll love that shit.
---
Yeah. I asked.
---
So what happens after the delay and it’s still unpolished like the rest of the game and they spend another year fixing the DLC?
---
I excited and old. 
---
Also excited for shopping at vendors, Hopefully we can all find a few bargains.
---
I said I'm not delusional, dad! YOU NEVER LISTEN
---
I feel like Bethesda is deliberately ignoring a lot of low hanging fruit cosmetics like BOS, Enclave, and Responders themes. Why haven't those been exploited at all 1 year into the game?
---
Responders got a few things but nothing on the order of Free States and Raiders. It's all so bizarre.
---
This is possibly the worst thing to hear right now.
---
Wastelanders was the only thing keeping me somewhat active in FO76.
---
Now that is canceled for now and they release private servers for money and more items in Atom Shop that is more than Cosmetics.
---
So nothing for us to enjoy and keep us going ...
---
This is not an exciting update no matter how they word it, worst update to FO76 timeline ever.
---
Thank you for Outer Worlds, ESO, Skyrim and Fallout 4. I am golden till FFVII Remake and CyberPunk. 
---
See you guys next November see how things are for year three 👍👌
---
We can only hope, either way basically the summary is "No new content for over 6 months and a more options to drop your cash on"
---
Brb, gotta go punch 1100 robots to death
---
yes thought and felt the same reading this.
---
especially the part that states that the community wanted all these quality of life stuff. this isnt true. ive never read somebody asking for scrapping or repair kits. ive never read somebody asking for a scrap collecting robot. i remember someone asking for a fridge. but as a quest reward not as a atom shop item.
---
i have a bad feeling about this tbh.
---
Don't write w/o brain v0.5 and please don't put words in my mouth, I'll spit them out .)
---
I am willing to actually pay a one time fee, but no subscription.
---
BUT I am only going to do that IF Beth makes sure that toons on modded servers don't come back to adv or nw.
---
For it to be payed?
---
3% take it or leave it.
---
Indeed! Release the patch with the thing, and quest to earn it, and also add right away a few skins for it in the Atomshop. Everyone wins?
---
No, I can see that they are wearing a vault suit just fine , but since you are apparently unable to see it I just told you a way to make it easier. It's a bug, they confirmed that it is a bug. you are wrong and should just learn to live with the fact that you can be wrong without having to act all weird about it. We are all just a bit annoyed by the fact that it would be an easy fix and they have not done anything about it. people are also annoyed by the fact that all these BOS folks are are a non decomposed body of fallout 4's nate. It's either lazy or a bug. In any case they should fix it.
---
I am surprised anyone is surprised by this. What games give you free private servers? I feel like all of the major require a fee
---
No for your opinion and what you’re doing when they come out
---
Yeah the people that write this stuff have a real gift for twisting words
---
It says later you will be able to mod your private server, and it says you will have to purchase it. No price given.
---
Covered in a LOT of anti-aging lotion.
---
If it costs 1000 atoms per month instead, I would have enough for a few months. Not sure about other people, but having at least about 1000 unspent atoms is probably not uncommon.
---
Then we take it from there and judge them accordingly. Until then we can only wait and see.
---
Just imagine the sense of accomplishment tho
---
I know, but the animation is the character turning the spit. I'm just saying that it would be a fun challenge if you could only roast on the spit, boil in the hanging pot, prepare roasts with the oven, etc.
---
Private servers were always going to cost money.
---
I saw the delay coming from a mile away, there’s just too many other problems to ignore before adding in an update that’s supposed to basically reboot the game. However, there is a severe lack of content that’s already taken it’s toll on a majority of the community, including most my friends. They’ve been spending their time with Monster Hunter, and honestly at this point I can’t blame them, Beth is new to this online experience but they definitely need to step it up with the smaller events like Meat Week, Halloween, etc. if they want to keep the game fresh for the dedicated players.
---
You should have to pay.  If they are maintaining the servers then that cost money.  Now if you was able to set up ya own servers then it should be free.
---
With the right mods on a handmade you can hip fire as accurate or more accurately than using Vats in a lot of situations. I ran some PvP with a buddy and it was interesting seeing how little Vats helped when you fight someone who uses cover and doesn't stop on the open while fighting.
---
Yep, exactly, most the people I know with 500+ hours are already moving on to other games. Then the stuff releasing around the corner is so good. The 2 hours of new content dropping with Wastelanders will not pull a significant amount of players back in imo.
---
Indeed, I'm only 186 but I've been through everything multiple times even with a 6months break. I really enjoyed playing this game but there is almost nothing besides the same daily's an Queen for any type of end game. I really wana play a game in the Fallout universe because I love it so much an I enjoy the concept but what are we do to? I guess I can't complain through because I did get 700+ hours of play time out of it. 
---
I definitely will probably look to Outter Worlds myself it seems. It is my Birthday on Sunday so I guess I can buy myself something new. It does seem like it will fill my itch for this style of game.
---
I have some mela weapons of u wanna chk em out
---
I'm just going to keep playing the game for free.
---
Yeah. Just not in the shop.
---
Other than wild appalachia, there’s been no significant content added since release. How can you expect to hold onto a player base with no content? Wastelanders being just around the corner was the only thing keeping me around. Now there’s no reason to be playing. This is a serious let down.
---
After 535 levels you definitely deserve a break and it sounds like you at least got your money worth. I do hope to see you back for wastelanders though! Sounds like it'll be even bigger then we thought.
---
I hope not. That's a new level of stupid.
---
Ill be playing f76, or some thing else, and 10 dollars richer each month.
---
I come back into the game time to time to see what's new and to have some fun with dailies and camp but honestly I don't expect anything anymore for this game.
---
I feel the same, there are a ton of great games coming next year and I dont see myself reinstalling fallout 76 when the update hits. I quit The Division 2 with the intention of coming back when the raids came out, but never returned. I love Fallout but I have nothing left to do except farming legendaries now, too bad..
---
Are you new to online gaming?
---
MMOs were subscription based in the early years. You had to buy the game, then pay monthly to play. That kept hosting and development afloat, with the added benefit of the player base mostly being working adults (some more mature than others).
---
Then came the younger generation that didn't like this. They wanted to buy the game and play for free. So companies like Activision monetized this approach by releasing a "new" Call Of Duty every 6 months that everybody just had to buy up. Then people caught on....
---
Fast forward and welcome to micro transactions!!!
---
Video game development takes time and money. Lots of both. Your initial development is not much different than making a movie; it is a massive time ($$$$) investment that you hope to make back upon release via sales. If you profit then it means you have done something fantastic, and you move on. 
---
Unfortunately development doesn't get any easier or less expensive when it comes time to make updates. Let us pretend that programmers in Austin TX make the local minimum wage of $15/hr (hint: they make more). Let us also pretend that things like employment tax, social security, health care, all that fine stuff that employers have to pay does not exist. To pay one programmer for one week of full time work, that would be $600. 
---
How many copies of the game must sell in a single week to pay one programmer for a full week of work?
---
How many programmers are working on fo76? It is definitely greater than 1. 
---
I'm tired of typing, do I need to keep going?
---
Private servers should cost money 👍🏽
---
Yes probably. Though since private servers being something you pay for is not unheard of I don't think that story will get more traction.
---
I’d prefer them to delay it rather than rush it out. Remember the release of this game?
---
Given what the entire Automatron/Far Harbor/Nuka World DLCs went for - with all the content they brought - I kinda doubt your pricing rationale there. Besides, those things should have been covered by the initial $60 price (or $200 if you bought the collectors edition) especially when early data mining plus YouTube videos showed the Vaults and missions were already in the game at launch - they just instanced and enabled them.
---
If that’s how long it takes to polish it I’m down. I just hope they don’t pull an Anthem &amp; fuck around instead of putting time towards Wastelanders.
---
What about Elder Scrolls Online?  I bought the game and I can play online.  So since I bought FO76 with my own money, shouldn’t I get access to servers?
---
Where did you see that price?
---
I took this game at beta and still loved it. I'll absolutely take the 3%!
---
I get it. Be positive. I try. Still play almost daily from day one. Just been around this circus long enough to not get my hopes up regardless what way they spin it.
---
If that happens I think you need to call tod on this game.
---
Coming from a bew playet, picked it up during the prime twitch sale. I'm alreasy done with this game. Level 38 and I feel like I have done it all.
---
Yeah ESO still has bugs 3-4 years after a shit show of a release. Don’t hold your breath.
---
This is different though, the turrets are still there, but the option to "disable targeting parameters" when you hack the terminal isn't. I'll just have to check again when I get on in a few days
---
yea apparently.
---
IDK how true it is, but there have been reports of people getting finding racist / otherwise bannable things written on their CAMP, after joining with randos. (since teammates can add to your camp)
---
I actually also write stuff on other peoples camps, i just write good things lol
---
I played Apex today. I had paid only 1$, so everyone could do the same. 
---
It only gave the location of some weapon. It didn't give me the weapon in my hand at the beginning of the game or the best weapon of the game. I don't understand why everyone called me p2w.
---
See, that is where you're wrong.
---
As much as I understand your point, and I will never say the fridge is op, to be fair, I find it pretty useless.
---
But I'll never say it's not p2w. It clearly gives you an advantage that other doesn't have. This is the definition of p2w.
---
Hopefully on some p2w games, it's not always the guy who paid who won
---
I’m guessing it will be cash only for the servers (by that I mean actual money not atoms)
---
It came from bethesda themselves lol
---
Standart Pricing
---
Yeah. Hopefully holiday updates and messing around with friends keep me into it but I’ve gotten on to the game a lot for those community challenges, so maybe we get some more
---
Yeah I suppose but this just seems like there doing it to re sell the game in tjw ps5 or new consoles
---
Bethesda have announced it on their Fallout blog
---
I agree. I would definitely buy Enclave cosmetics.
---
I belive it will be a small fee and you get a server for X amount of time, like for example realms in minecraft where you pay a small amount of irl money for a Month, 3 months, 6 months and so on. 😁
---
The ATOM shop is even getting updated so slowly lately. As for earning ATOMS in game those people are a crock of poop. You can only earn so much from the standard challenges. I've spent most I've earned through that way already. An the ones from daily's / weekly are so marginally small they take forever to get something since the cost of everything has increased significantly.
---
Definitely. Netflix or Hulu are on the chopping block to just offset my monthly subs for this. Probably Netflix as I hardly use it. Hello private server sub.
---
&gt;We’ve continued to re-evaluate and change our processes to make sure the work we’re doing hits our quality bar,
---
Is that what my character keeps stubbing his toe on?
---
And I also love that the way they justify it is by saying we wanted the utilities, like sure we did want more utility but not behind a paywall that like 2 people suggested it should be behind. It’s like they can’t acknowledge any mistakes or apologize for lying.
---
Radtoads are already gay, snallygasters too. Nuka cherry is what turns the players gay. And you dont even know what happens after you down a nukashine. You didnt even bat an eye when they released solid color power armor paints did you? All the colors of the rainbow.
---
Yes. Give us the option to save multiple camps, location and all, but only load one at a time. Maybe add a little cap tax for switching between them. I want to build more stuff, but I don't want to tear up my old camp and have nothing to go back to if, for whatever reason, my new build doesn't work.
---
You’re right. They do
---
Nope. jaj22 is correct. I have all the melee weapons and tested for myself.
---
You're level 38, you've barely played the game to say you've done everything.
---
This is the article :  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more)
---
I'd recon that if you're running a bloodied heavy weapons build, you'd probably last longer in PA with Emergency Protocols.  I mean, it's 50% damage reduction.  You combine that with Dodgy, Action Boy, get both legs modded for kinetic servo's for the ap regen, and the already very high DR and ER of the T-51b or Strangler PA, then you're very, very hard to kill.
---
I have a friend with a B25 handmade just like me, but his is reload and mine is 50dr while aiming.  He has adrenal just like me, set at 20% hp, and he hits for 20-ish if I'm in the 20% hp zone for Emergency Protocols to proc.
---
I also have Strangler PA so that's the main reason I eat, sleep, piss and shit in it.
---
PS5 and New Xbox wouldn't be out for 9 months after Wastelanders release if it's Q1 so that doesn't make much sense
---
Doesn't that require you to be low hp a lot? Seems not really my style. I'll give it *a shot* but I'm not actually looking for a 1 shot build. I like my fights to feel a bit more epic. One of the big reasons I don't like snipers builds.
---
I crash every few days.. the only game that does this to me on PS4... reinstalling F76 didn't help.. yeah it is unbelievable.. yet I'm still playing dang.
---
RadShield + rad resistant perk card maxed. If they are full Heath I am sure they have the perk card that heals your team mates rads when you take rad dmg. I can’t remember the name unfortunately.
---
Same, but I can live with it *if* they'll allow CAMPs to persist. That's honestly the only thing that would bring me back at this point.
---
Quick fix, crouch while you’re reloading.
---
This game is full o people who like to pay for the sake of paying...
---
I have a balanced build and can one-hit charred ferals using an Instigating Ski Sword and all the one-handed perks+Bloody Mess. You don't have to go bloody.
---
Definitely agree with more events. Even through some of them are just go kill X of Y they are still good in adding more things to do to the game that isnt just the same repetitive 20 daily's to choose from. With the change to events you cant even hardly mix it up much anymore. Theres so many events I haven't even seen once since the change.
---
how about a 1 in 1000 chance to craft a legendary weapon or armor, 1 in 10,00 for 2 star etc. maybe a perk card addition? idk
---
This is great news!! Private servers coming so soon is a surprise, but it makes sense to have private servers operational before Wastelanders.  Looking forward to purchasing one of those for my team! And I'm ok waiting to sometime in Q1 for Wastelanders, good to wait to get it worked out.
---
I suppose renting private servers wouldn't be too bad if you can earn everything just the same without having random players in the world. But how would that work for friends you invite? Would they need to rent them too? Or is it free if you're invited?
---
“We heard from many of you who wanted items with some real utility.”
---
Hahahahahahahahhaaahahhhhahhahaha
---
Ikr
---
 Hi ok, I'm Dad!
---
Isn't ps5 on December
---
If you think about it, private servers with no friends = you're paying for single player in a multiplayer game. It seems video games have come full circle lol
---
Not really pay to win just kinda pay to be more convenient. Not like a fridge does 800 dps.
---
Tbf you have to purchase private servers in 99% of games, rest sucks though
---
good point! vendors should be very full tonight!
---
I have been having some luck with TS in Vats. It feels like the critical hit applies the homing accuracy bonus to the second shot as well. It may also gain the damage bonus. I am using it on a projectile weapon, the plasma pistol, so that might be the reason it is exceptionally effective for me.
---
How are energy weapons? Plasma rifle tesla gun etc?
---
I'm happy to hear that there's a cost involved in private servers. Otherwise the workshops are going to be rendered useless in adventure mode. I guess one alternative would be to turn off the workshops for private servers.
---
They can always just remove the backwards feature Sony ain't too fond of it
---
Never done a raid. Unless they release something that is for us non power armor people I have litterally zero incentive to do them. It's faster to farm legendary outside of it.
---
Where can I find this 400% damage boost? I must be doing it wrong.
---
Honestly, I’d be ok with that.
---
Troll free, no goo piles everywhere, pure solo SBQ and Encryptid completions, no dead enemies at atom challenge locations, lag free raids......sounds worth it to me. Shit, I’d pay just to not have to compete with 6 other players trying to get shots in at 1VN and UF events.
---
I could easily spend $120 on a date night with my wife. Seems reasonable to me.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely not complaining.  I've put more time into this game than I have in every other game I've played in my life combined.  I'm not sure why, but 76 stuck a chord with me and sucked me in hard.  But, here we are.  Nothing lasts forever, I guess.
---
will we be able to keep our current online character or will we have to start a whole new character on the private world/s?
---
I'm actually okay with wastelanders getting delayed.
---
A. Every new game comes out between now and December so there's alot of stuff to play
---
B. Gives them time to get it right and not mess it up.
---
C. Nothing really comes out in Q1 it's a dead quarter for gaming usually. 
---
D. With the holidays coming some people have very little time to play anyways.
---
Thanks for the honesty Bethesda.
---
Waste landers got delayed?? I mean I knew it was happening but didn’t see the announcement.
---
I've missed PP a few times as I'll step away to swap out laundry, empty the dishwasher, etc. I'll come back and realize the event is mostly over and there's only one friendly left. My presence might not make a huge difference, but even having 2 friendlies alive makes for better rewards.
---
  \-- Bethesda never said this. Go back and research the quote from Pete Hines.
---
Will we have to repurchase it for steam or can we link accounts? I would much rather play through steam obviously but not enough to buy it again.
---
We need to pay for a private server option?? Lol
---
Yeah hopefully. I'm sure that the modders will be coming up with some good additions. They have a ton of good mods for building in FO4.
---
I didnt know until now that it gor delayed. Well as a level 155 im content to jusy delete it. Outerworlds awaits.
---
"We heard from many of you who wanted items with some real utility." More like you heard a lot of your higher ups/investors wanted more Cash shop sales, lets be real the community hated utility items being added to Atom Shop we wanted it to be earned in game corporate lie at its finest here.
---
That's not how quarters work, try mathing.
---
A year to late my friend... spoiler, your horse dies.
---
Sadly, I expected a delay on Wastelanders so let's just get the private server pricing soon.
---
It's in this weeks inside the vault just came out like 45min ago or something. But it's not just WASTELANDERS its everything delayed. Legendary perks, perk loadouts, etc..
---
My BSS meathook is called “one slap chap”
---
One weapon that uses two different weapon perk sets and a ton of consumables can do that so it's a bit of a skewed example.
---
Q1 is. Jan 1st to march 31st
---
What adavantage does the camp fridge give that you cant get from the maxed out good with salt perk or refrigerated mod on a backpack? Same thing with scrap bots and junk extractors?
---
They just shot themselves in the foot.
---
October 23rd will be Path 14
---
Yeah lol
---
You also appear to be having a stroke.
---
That’s not a private server.
---
Must have all the damage. I do it with heavy weapons on the queen.
---
I thought game development revolved around the fiscal year, in which Q4 would end in March and Q1 would begin in April?
---
No offense meant by this but we all already know you mean pvp the second you uttered "remove vats..." XD
---
I think your last point says a lot though.  You have the advantage when you take advantage of a game defining core mechanic.  IE when you play the game as it was designed to be played you have the advantage over guys who refuse learn how to play the game and just keep asking for the game to be made more like another game they are better at.
---
I am very interested in the private world option, but have some questions.  
---
1) Price.  
---
2) Will player stash and camp limits he increased? I only plan on playing with 2-3 other friends. If I gave a hard cap on the player count. Shouldn’t my stash / camp limits go up?  
---
3) Just what can we do in this? Like as alter things like spawn rates etc? Just is it just the base experience but private?  
---
4) Will there be a server listing? Like say BF4. You see all the games you can join. Or is it only friends can see it.
---
Just checked again since its 12:05pm est and no dice still no sale.
---
There were people waiting for this like the second coming
---
Yeah there’s really no turning back once the part is over where you feed the bins to level up your animal. There could be 4 lv100+ players capable of one hitting that cant keep a blood bug alive lol. That part is essential but it starts so quickly once you initiate.
---
My two shot auto primed combat rifle is a beast.  170 dmg without chems or adrenaline activated.  If I sneak with covert operative it’s 2.5x dmg.  So bottom line I’m close to 250 dmg and with ground pounder and a 20 shot clip it is a road grader.
---
Bethesda is in way over their heads, fucking clueless. This will be a case study in how to torpedo a 1b+ franchise
---
I mean it was an obvious statement of them dissolving their already broken promise of keeping it cosmetic only, I’m surprised they even made a statement to be honest
---
ESO makes up the money with cosmetic and their subscription.  When you pay the 15 you get all dlc and a crafting bag.  Every game is different.
---
I know, for some reason I was more expecting a 'Community Test Environment', not paid servers.
---
&gt;And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”

Source?
---
It's good that they're delaying Wastelanders. Releasing a half-baked version would've been disastrous. I'm hoping the upcoming weapon balance overhaul patch comes sometime soon though.
---
Yes. I also remember. Vault raids, fasnacht,arktos,imposter sheepsquatch, and that sewer thing. Excited for wastelanders but not having any expectations.
---
I had a bunch of mirelurk kings make me their bitch yesterday lol.
---
I mean, they did say it would be cosmetic only. So...
---
Ugh the anticipation of it coming next month was a big motivator to keep me playing, may have to take a little break.
---
I’m heavy speced into shotguns and I was messing around with my friend. He was I think maybe level 54 and I was maybe level 15 3 good blasts from a combat shotgun and he was dead. I’m still heavily speced into shotguns but I’ve also started branching to rifles. So my recommendation is shotguns.
---
Well, I look at it like this.  Yes, it's disappointing.  But at the same time, for one, it's absolutely vital that they get Wastelanders right, or else this game isn't going to have a future.  And second, I think there will be enough seasonal events between now and then to tide us over.  There will probably be one for Thanksgiving, another for Christmas.  Maybe even New Years.  It's going to go by fast.
---
I'm all for them reworking the challenges, it would be nice for them to actually work for a change instead of being f#$king broke.
---
I have killed the SBQ a few times now and it still doesn't register, the daily challenge for picking up launch codes doesn't work either yet again.
---
I'd complete all my outstanding challenges if I actually could
---
Apparantly, what a nice crowd!
---
Such a shame too, was waiting for private servers to get back to the game, but not if I have to pay even more for it after buying it at release.
---
I know. It looks like they almost certainly set up the WS rooms to eventually be unlocked by players after they masquerade as a state inspector and authorize the robots to resume renting rooms.
---
That's a fair point.  It's been my experience (having tried more points in adrenaline in the past) that bumps to perception and agi pay off more.  Because I already one-shot most mobs, I find that it's easier to sustain VATS/crit cycle with more agi/per.  It's rarer to be able to turn to a larger boss/legendary to burn down after getting adrenaline going, though I think that's largely play-style dependent.
---
So, tl;dr.
---
We are delaying Wastelanders to Q1 of 2020.
---
We are gonna be selling non cosmetic stuff in the atom shop because we noticed that stuff sells well.
---
you can also give us more money for private servers.
---
Have fun waiting 3 more months for actual content while we bleed you dry knowing full well that you have nothing left to do other that buy more stuff.
---
I don't mind it being delayed since the current game's stability is absolute garbo
---
Yep, that's a really good way to put it.
---
Y u say that?
---
Isn’t there one which is 1000 robots+ with black powder weapons? RIP looks like Watoga heights is my new home!
---
Got no problem with this. Outer Worlds till November the 5th, then RDR2.
---
Private servers are never free. That’s why you get free access to the public servers.
---
This week's inside the vault update
---
I don’t think that’s fair. There are season events and will still come out with new stuff. Just not the huge DLC until it’s stable and fully fleshed our. The screenshots look promising.
---
Still nothing?
---
Completely 100% agree. Most of the ones I have left are impossible, huge time sinks, or broken. I’m ready for a system that works.
---
Ah. Great 🙃
---
Especially if you run covert operative perk. More than double XP.
---
I'm super excited too!  I've saved up about 1100 scrip!
---
And paid private servers, no more "only cosmetic" on atomstore... Bethesda can go fuck themselves.
---
Yes, this is exactly what we have been asking for since last November- Beth to take some time to iron out the creases before releasing. Kudos to the team there, it must've been a difficult time for the Devs and probably a very draining few months work! And although some people here are whining, I'm sure I speak for the majority in reiterating that as players we'd rather a better experience than a rushed product.
---
Yeah, that's what I was referencing, and you're right the first 4 rounds AA is better but after that Furious beats it and when it comes to a LMG, ROF is king.
---
The game looses players faster than it gains them
---
Are you going to respond to my comment about the frames or just keep whining about them having blue under armor that’s visible (76 is not visible unless you glitch)?
---
Certainly hope not... google says 2020 Q1 is Jan1 to Mar31
---
Yeah seems like it. Already took a 6 months break from the game. Came back a month ago now time to take another I guess even though I dont want to. But they are honestly forcing a lot of end game players at this point. I cant do the Queen an same daily's for another 6 months while we wait for something that might be another micro DLC.
---
There's nothing to justify private servers being paid for...

bethEsdA - “if it’s in the game, it’s because you paid for it in the Atomic Shop”
---
E.A have been talking to Todd.
---
The servers I've been on for the last week n a bit have been pretty much dead in adventure, I'm expecting them to be even more dead when private servers launch n people go to them instead of the normal ones
---
Hi expecting them to be even more dead when private servers launch n people go to them instead of the normal ones, I'm dad.
---
 Hi expecting, I'm Dad!

"If you don't want to spend money in the Atomic shop for cosmetic stuff you don't have to. We give you a sh*tload of Atoms just for playing the game," Hines said.
---
"All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60,"
---
I'd be ok with the delay if they could release the legendary perks system in 2019.
---
It's a 12% increase for 5 perk points so it's not great for all weapons.
---
Try and get an armor penetrating melee weapon to start. I can 1 shot most things with a sneaking crit or a running power attack.
---
I know lol its ridiculous i don't know how Bethesda manages to screw up so often and continue making efforts to get worse.
---
Bloodied/low hp builds are the most powerful, but junkies is a good alternative. +75% damage @ 20% hp.... or.... +50% damage @ any hp range, but lose a few stats. AND if you do your research you can pick which stats to lose based on your build and what chemo you decide to get addiction to. (Just consume 5 of the same kind and you're almost guaranteed to get addicted.
---
As a heavy weapons user, you.are going to have a tougher time since you don't benifit from sneak attacks, and without a bloodied weapon, you aren't going to be at low hp to take advantage of perks like Nerd Rage. 
---
Bloodied Sneak attack rifles are perhaps the most powerful in game followed by a melee build.
---
Just curious about.how.many rounds does it take to kill high level super mutants? Never ran LMG build in 76 before. Just trying to get an idea. Could use that chart and guess i suppose lol
---
My main is level 190 and she run's a typicalish Heavy weapons PA build with a Legendary 2 star Vampire's Explosive Gatling Gun. It may not be bloodied and it may not one shot a Scorchbeast but it does alright (5-7 shots), handles 98% of the mobs just fine and I never struggle with health or ammo consumption. The only real problem I deal with or ever have to worry about are Mirelurk kings.
---
I will also switch to a unarmed build with the same main. Modded Vanilla Marine armor set with a 3 star Anti Armor Swing Speed meat hook with reduced weight for when I go into west tek, Watoga Medical or see a deathclaw, Sheepsquatch/Imposter, or Fogcrawler. EZPZ no bloodied but again I choose to avoid the kings.
---

---
Starts in just under 3 hours.
---
October 23 is a Wednesday. That’s irregular. Is everything okay? Lol
---
The atomic shop part makes me worried for the future of monetization in this game.
---
If the debate is what is better a 2 star or 3 star the majority of time it’s the 3 star.  From a selling aspect 3 stars will always fetch a lot more and let’s not forget the scrip value is 40 v 15.
---
I can guarantee that when wastelanders launches it will still be a broken mess
---
Really, the biggest issue I have is the atom shop changes. That's a complete reverse from their promise and I'm not looking forward to what it becomes.
---
Private servers being paid is kind of expected. If they're hosting, it's going to cost money to set up and maintain.
---
And hopefully the wastelanders delay means we won't get a dumpster fire on release.
---
But I'm wary they're going to put everything worthwhile in the atom shop and new content for free is going to dwindle, aside from maybe some new weapons and armor that may or may not be useful.
---
Doubt it
---
They must think we are idiots lol corporate BS as always.
---
Disappointed, but not surpised. I expected it to be delayed, and if that means a better, less buggy Wastelanders then I'm all for it, but I'm still disappointed because I've really been looking forward to it.
---
Yea, to allow others to play. Minecraft though i can create my own private server and just host myself. That is what fallout 76 needs. Not some bullshit like this.
---
In just under 3 hours most likely.
---
Why?
---
For real
---
Except industry standard
---
I’m pretty sure Patch 14 is just Public Event adjustments &amp; bug fixes am I wrong? Just another none sense update they don’t need to get us excited for😂
---
Maybe your face is a canning station
---
Why is everyone surprised that private servers will cost money?
---
Is Murmel here now? Need to know if I should leave from work now... ;-)
---
Hope Bethesda make a some free weekends instead of delayed update, cause without new content until 2020 many people leave or stop playing. Game need new blood right now.
---
Reactions like yours are why developers hate to estimate release dates.  I've written code for a living for about 20 years, and I no longer give estimates on when something will be done.  
---
Shit happens.  No one knows the future.  Don't get so attached to an estimated date.  It's an estimate.  They do not know when it will be done.  No one ever ever knows.
---
Try running melee build perks along with adrenal reaction and eagle eyes serum. Does me some good critical damage
---
So, dead game till next year? If not forever, since by then, plenty of games with actual content and regular support will come out and everyone will forget this disappointment.
---
oh fuck, I didn't even think of the ammo converter being an atomic shop item.
---
Agreed. Private servers shouldn’t be paid for. If BGS is desperate to make f76 profitable, they should instead forces on the games health and bugs and fix them. Players would feel more comfortable buying atoms for a game they feel will play a long time, rather than not buy any at all because they know they’ll get fed up with the broken game and leave the game
---
The spectre of E.A looms heavy with this announcement. 
---
You can thank all the players that paid for the non cosmetics.
---
That’s the best way to acquire a decent weapon.  Not at the legendary vendor.  That’s more about accumulating legendaries and flipping them.
---
This was released today so that the bad news of Wastelanders being delayed is covered by the 50% Purveyor sale. I'll use my scrip today but I'll see you guys when Wastelanders actually comes out -- bugs no doubt included.
---
I see a lot of good comments/info already stated, but Bloodied is not the End All build, I have 2 separate character builds, and although the Bloodied build hits a bit harder with some weapons, My Stealth Rifleman/Heavy, does much better on the SBQ battles
---
Main, Stealth build (Maintains Stealth 70+% throughout battle), AAFFR 50 Cal, hitting SBQ for193/round when Adrenaline is maxed, and I seldom ever Die.
---
Secondary, Bloodied Build, (Brief periods of Stealth Damage during SBQ battles) BE 50 Cal hitting @ 159/round, and I usually die several times.
---
People surprised/upset over this have no idea about paid private servers on other games.
---
The photomode ones are pretty easy for the regions that don't have specific locations lol. Just keep open and closing photomode a ton of times and then voila, atoms. 
---
Really wish it would count the MANY times I've dropped into a SBQ battle. Or if I could find a damn flatwoods monster.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more
---
Bruh
---
Yeah I wonder if they have ever played battlefield/Conan/ literally any other online game
---
Who cares no one is forcing you to buy them
---
I wish they'd just post this stuff or maybe I missed it?
---
Bye
---
They could have updated us months ago in these private servers and I'm sure alot of the player base would still be active.
---
Pushing wastelanders is ridiculous.. but atleast it will have more time to be fixed I guess.. even though it's going to be a broken mess and we all know it.
---
I am actually happy they decided to go with paid private servers.
---
 If they didn't almost every single person who plays would have their own server which I don't think Bethesda could handle all that.
---
Private Servers are also coming way sooner than people thought.... but they will cost money
---
It’s live
---
&gt;Curious to know what you guys are planning on doing in the mean time. Are you gonna stick around an continue all the way through on current content an play state or ? Let me know.
---
i quit after the TSE nerf ill probably return when wastelanders releases
---
Ugh that's not cool.
---
Yes they fucking did. Pete hines flat out said it would be cosmetic only for the atomic shop.
---
I was pretty sure its going to be a paid service since announcement.
---
If you expected to run your own server offline, yeah you shouldn't have to pay for that, but they never said they'd provide the server hosting software to run offline.  Any reference has suggested it would be online only.
---
If I were them I would wait until Wastelanders comes out. 
---
The biggest issue people have with the game is being addressed and without that I don't think it'll hold up well with the Steam crowd.
---
They needed to temper the delay of Wastelanders with an announcement of new events/content to fill the gap. Hell, even if you’re stretched too thin to come up with stuff like that, then break out some of the building pieces from Fallout 4 and add those to the game as a peace offering. *Something.* 
---
If I have little time for this game now, then there’s no way it can compete with the Q1 lineup of 2020. I appreciate that sometimes delays are inevitable, but I’m not sure Bethesda realises how important it was for Wastelanders to hit this year. It’s just another half-assed effort from a year that brought us....Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter? Not nearly enough. 
---
Really though, it’s their statement about the atom shop that’s the death knell for me. Players dismissed it as scaremongering when we said the fridge and scavenging station, if bought and supported, would be taken as permission to widen the wedge. Well, it’s happening, and their announcement of looking again at challenges? I would be amazed if the rewards don’t get pinched further, or made harder to obtain, as a result. 
---
I may take a look next year, just to see how bad the damage is, but as for hanging around in the meantime? Not a chance. This game doesn’t respect my time, and it doesn’t respect yours either.
---
Yay more utility items in the atomic shop, I'd rather just buy them instead of earn them in game anyway! /s
---
This
---
I'm sure some community manager can clarify, but I'm pretty sure that's a separate thing.
---
Beyond disappointed in this news but not surprised - everyone on here has been calling it for months. Just can't believe they waited until mid-Oct to announce the delay for something they promised in the Fall. Did they just realize this?
---
I expect nothing from the Subterranean Babushka. 
---
If Babushka Bless with good gun or good armor then I will be a happy bear. If not, it's just a game. Win some loose some.
---
[](/gummystare)
---
I play with a faction- I can’t wait to play on a private server with them. We will all simply chip in. I hope we can pay extra for extra slots.
---
I knew it was going to get delayed.. it better be as good as you're making it out to be.
---
Is there any reason to get excited with this game at all??? Delayed the only thing that might bring some excitement which is wastelanders, they just announced pay-to-win/"time savers" microtransations and subscription rent servers on top of the game we bought.
---
Them keeping us in the dark on the time is not good.so we dont know if its est or pst.
---
It is entirely based on wether it is peer to peer or hosted by them.
---
Games like GTA use Peer to Peer, so one player in the game “hosts” the session while the others play in it.
---
AFAIK Fallout 76 runs on servers that BGS operates, along with cost to run.
---
If you want your own server slot (that will take up a public server spot) they want you to pay for it.
---
There’s a couple of ways to see this.  I think dropping amidst all the new content this fall it will have stiff competition.  So a short-lasting bump. However, in that post-seasonal depression come Q1 when it feels like you’ve pilfered through all the new content, it will be there...tempting you, teasing you, waiting for you to log on.  And like a long-lost, but n’er forgotten mistress, it will greet you with a wry smile and a new shade of lipstick.  Half of the allure will be in remembering the secrets of days past, and half will be in the intrigue to know what new secrets must lie behind such a grin...or something like that.
---
Very extensive an good list. Agree with a lot of your points. But one I didnt see is fixing the melee bug. I'm well over lvl 160 an lvl 1 scorched absorb my first and 2nd attacks all the time because the bug / server stability.
---
Most people like myself, just wanted private servers to play with their friends only and not deal with people messing with them. Although I see your point, BGS could implement ways to mitigate overloading. Similar to what other online games do
---
I expect TOW to be a buggy mess when it launches. Obsidian has just a bad track record for launches as Bethesda does
---
All online multiplayer games that have private servers has someone charge for it.  No one gives them for free.  It would be financial suicide.
---
But it won't work lol
---
Sadly, for now, it seems true
---
I rather they do it well and push it back than release a broken update
---
No they do not. I can host a private server on my own lan for free with almost every game that offers private servers. CSGO, minecraft, quake.  Why can I not host the world on my own computer so I can play solo? That makes no sense.
---
u/Valseek, u/Ladydevann, by 2020 Q1 you mean from January 1 to March 31 or from April 1 onwards?
---
Me and a random are holding down the fort and thumbs down emoting to everyone rushing to get the discount to let them no the sale isn't live yet.
---
I don't disagree that it would be awesome if it was specific items based on the station you used.
---
is it??? i just reset my app. it wasnt a second ago!!
---
If wastelanders gets released before March my mind will be blown
---
I thought it said the 18th?
---
It better be immaculate. . .
---
My Furious/Explosive LMG can kill one in a short burst as long as I hit the chest and let the recoil pull it up to the head, about 15-20 rds.
---
And that’s part of the problem. Why not implement it peer to peer? Why go with the less popular and what makes the studio seem like they desperate for money?
---
Yeah it should at least be consistent with their other releases
---
How much will private servers cost? Is it one-off payment or a repeating payment?
---
It's that outrage hotness is all.
---
I have. Battlefield is a vastly different game. Single-player is what Fallout has always been about; having the ability to play solo should be a fundamental, free addition to the game.
---
Are you mad at Minecraft as well for paid servers?
---
It sounds like you are buying your own private server from beth? I mean doing that isnt free for them so meh.
---
Can't agree more tbh, if it's delayed AND still buggy n unplayable this subreddit will be a shitstorm
---
Good point. I don’t use melee much so I forget about this issue a lot. Would love to see it fixed for good
---
Guarantee it will still be broken at launch
---
I know!! I can actually play other games now and see how I like them. I'm excited for Outer world's
---
Cool info ty!
---
It should come in about 40 minutes I think.
---
Yeah I’m not surprised Server Hosting ain’t cheap at all.
---
Wait wait wait, so we finally get private servers and the Geck for it isn’t even available??? What’s the point?
---
da comrade!
---
Delaying Wastelands is without a doubt a good idea it does make me worried tho.
---
Except why would they ever buy atoms when they can just use free mods that do the same thing and use them on the hypothetical free private server. No one would ever spend a dime again.
---
Provided you have enough room for all the perk cards needed this can be a really fun gun.  I lucked into the BE version of the pipe bolt.  With all the Rifleman cards and just three Gunslinger for 30% it easily reaches 700+ damage.  Not great for crowd control I’m afraid, but handles Huntersville just fine.  
---
Now, if we could just dual-wield pipe guns.....you know, since they’re at such a disadvantage....
---
Congrats on your pipe bolt, hope it stays with you!
---
"As we get closer to a game state that is good enough to call a Beta..."
---
and they said cargo pants are useless!
---
 It was stopped cause apparently it was only giving out nocturnal armor and limb damage weapons
---
Minecraft doesn't lock solo play or mods behind their private servers tho
---
honestly i wish they would just straight up ask us to spend money in the atomic shop. Something along the lines of “If you support fallout 76 please consider purchasing atoms” I get that it’s a service, and they need to make money. But the way that they’re going is gonna end up with them selling guns
---
They had to have known they needed to push the date would’ve been nice if they announced it 2 months ago. Easier to cope. Oh well..
---
Sure, why not! Open to all fun ideas like this. I think a slim chance to do so would give us a reason to actually craft some of the weapons that don’t have many mods.
---
As it stands, how many people are actually crafting LMGs, Death Tambos, etc? No point to do so. This would be a fun incentive.
---
Well, look at it this way.  With many players clinging to the idea that Wastelanders was releasing next month, would you rather they rip off the bandage now, or the last week before November? 😋
---
I don't understand how most of this sub can talk constantly about how the game should've been delayed and then released later in a better state only to turn around and complain that Wastelanders is getting delayed.
---
They have already added 2 weapons, I believe you mean "competitive weapons".
---
lol
---
So you delayed the content people wanted but are able to get our weapons we can buy? Wasn’t the promise that the atom shop would never be pay to win?
---
Disappointing and pretty obvious.  I was looking forward to buying this finally but will go play outer worlds.
---
The sale is live as of 5 minutes ago.
---
Right? I was reading the article all excited and getting into the vibe but finished it like “okay .... so no Wastelanders in 2019 and Bethesda basically just admitted they’re making the game pay to win. Wtf?”
---
Relaunch your game sale is live
---
So you're telling me that I only have to change my build, remove some of my perks in order to add other, so I would not need the fridge?
---
Or I could just change my backpack that give me more resistance. 
---
Or I could just change my pretty good camp place. 
---
Seems fair.
---
False.
---
The problem with this is that BGS has a track record of ALWAYS messing things up with things they implement/update. Take vault raids for example. And the whole”servers are laggy because people do too many things” argument is pretty stupid. A game released 5+ years ago can have 30+ players in a server with everyone blowing shit up with flying cars and planes and I have yet to encounter a server crash
---
No sh**?
---
Exactly just had us waiting like chumps
---
Well said, an I agree with your points. Guess we will indeed be seeing the drop of players significantly. Dont blame anyone. Also really agree that if they think they are gonna be able to pull back / retain players with a Wastelanders update next year with such an outdated system already is just nonsense. Their past DLC has been micro an personally not that interesting. I'm honestly gonna be shocked if Wastelanders isnt the same if not just an extra 2 quest added.
---
Dude ... its the same as saying your car will get smashed in GTA...
---
17th-21st
---
It's live now
---
Nocturnal *wood* armor ;-)
---
Bye Felicia
---
That’s what I read
---
Saturating a target with bullets (and in the case of tse explosions) is what it's good for.
---
Also some perks are on a per bullet basis so a ts weapon with say the perk where every hit has a chance to fill your crit meter can be fairly powerful in the right players hands.
---
Feel the same here, this part had me worried
---
Why is having pay to win items in the atom shop treated like some amazing thing? LOL, Bethesda, I love fallout 76 but you guys just won't stop making dumb ass decisions constantly.
---
Yeah it will probably be an hour before we see Yongyea or some other shmuck yelling about charging for private servers when the concept of that has been around for years.
---
&gt; Not like a fridge does 800 dps.
---
Speak for yourself
---
I got awesome rolls on weapons, put the tinfoil hat away and keep spending
---
It is not, wait til next year Q1 :(
---
I've never even seen one, over 200 hours in game. I only got my first LMG at like 180 hours
---
Course I also don't grind for legendaries like everyone else seems to, so
---
really?? ive rebooted twice and its still the same prices. whats your secret?
---
Wait you don't have to actually take a picture?
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
Bloodied Weapon + Adrenaline + Gun-Fu
---
Yup. The positive tone of the post really tries hard to disguise how shit this is.
---
There's always The Outer Worlds, releasing next week!
---
lol this subreddit is always a shit storm, I kinda like it
---
Did a hard reset last night.
---
Level 50 Backpack was still gone. Ability to craft a new one at level 50 was back.
---
So glitch, user error, who the hell knows. But the story had a happy ending.
---
I think Rockstar can afford with how much they make with their shark cards.
---
Absolutely any game that lets you self-host a private server, which used to be the norm for every multiplayer game and is still the case for a lot of them.
---
I hear ya man. My woman is three days over due with our first  little one and my dumbass is still excited to get home and turn in some scrip. I told she gotta wait till the sale is over...jokingly...kinda....sorta.. LOL
---
They plan to induce on the 22nd at 4pm. She won't have the kid till the 23. THE DAY THE BOMBS DROPPED! So weird guess fallout isn't the only world that changed on OCT 23. The hype is real
---
Those type of mods only exist on PC. As both consoles don’t support public made mods. And I highly doubt BGS will make mods available in game to give you everything in the atom shop.
---
According to Bethesda, users want to pay for private servers, for more things that affect the game in the atomic store and other bullshit ... in a game full of bugs and problems that I have been thinking for a month without playing for obvious reasons of performance, stability, delays and varied excuses.
---
Now suddenly the private payment servers will have better performance than the "free" of the game ...
---
Soon ... season passes with atoms to play the new events ...
---
It may be all different from what we think but ... unfortunately what we least think is that Bethesda is really listening and taking into account the opinion of the users so everything is possible ... but whatever is good for the business and Bad for users ... even more.
---
\----
---
In a WELL implemented system they would let us have our own local servers synchronized with theirs so that no one could clone or cheat ... but it gives me that this will not be viable for them ... since their security is currently not exactly exemplary ...  I am afraid that they now separate the community with this.
---
i feel ya. but i'm holding out to see what the prices are. i'd be willing to pay a reasonable amount for the ability to mod it out. weird that private worlds release before mods will be made available. but... imperfect as it all is... i still enjoy the lore even as tangled up as it all is now. we'll see. they have went 180' from the original vision of '76 and that's a good thing. they need this to continue bringing in $ for at least a few more years...so, some of it will have to be good. they're calling it a 'service' tho, so i'm assuming a monthly fee instead of a one time purchase...that is worrisome.
---
The last time I even saw one violent night was literally the day after the new public events system. I'm getting leader of the pack and distant thunder upseberal times on a 3hr session though so that's nice
---
 Hi getting, I'm Dad!
---
So its live?
---
Eh, release said that they'd allow private servers down the line with mods. That's what I had based myself on and enjoyed FO76 immensely. Replied somewhere else that a game allowing you to rent a server doesn't exclude hosting your own, Minecraft and ARK being prime examples.
---
It's just a shame, I want to be in control of my server and have the equipment to, but not going to shell out a monthly payment for it.
---
I know it was a joke... but Minecraft’s only alternative to a shared world without someone having to be on is paid servers. There are small parallels, really. But it was just a joke
---
I’m not surprised but I’m very disappointed.
---
It looked like a power fist in the vid I saw.
---
I suspect there will be some seasonal events from now to the end of the year, like Mischief Night.  Probably one for Thanksgiving, another for Christmas or New Years.
---
It costs money for them to provide. Why would they just give it out for free? If they don't generate an I come or at least cover costs, the game will not exist. 
---
Private servers will probably be very handy since wastelanders will be centered around instance technology. We already see how laggy it is in vault 94 on a full server during peak times
---
But it will be buggy as fuck. Every Fallout has been a buggy mess. I don't understand what's wrong with that, even Obsidian had to call in Bethesda to fix NV because it was too buggy and unplayable at release
---
&gt;I'm already noticing a lot of familiar names on PS4 and PC in both adventure mode and Nuclear Winter.
---
Same for XBox.
---
It really sucks. I wanted this game to be great. As a whole, I love the Fallout series. But when I don't even purchase atoms anymore because I'm not seeing appropriate return on my investment, they're out of their mind if they think I'll pay for my own server.
---
Those weapons that have the exact same stats and mods as weapons you can already craft in game because they are actually skins? They are just combat knives and machetes lol. Gotcha.
---
And I’m sure BGS would be Abel to afford it also if they actually focused on the game health and not figuring out how to milk the smaller community it has
---
Let's say they could create a server you could run yourself and little to no cost to them. 
---
Let's not forget the games entire revenue model hinges on atom shop purchases. 
---
A free private server means you never buy atoms again (why would you if you can mod it?) . 
---
That's suicide for this game.
---
I'm not crazy. Out of eight rolls, six of them were the worst possible make. Given this game's history with sales, I'm right to be worried.
---
again your referencing games designed to be multiplayer this engine was never made for this and its amazing they got it to do what they have. The bottom line is some people will always complain and the people complaining about this now are probably the same type of people that would complain if this service was free they would just find something else to complain about. How dare a company charge for a service they spend money on, How dare a company try to be profitable sheesh its ludacris /s
---
I know it's part of the Lying Lowe quest line, so I guess you get it from Encryptid. All I've ever got from Encryptid has been White Wolf Fedoras. I have plenty of caps on my melee, and quite a few on my shotgunner; but my sniper (the one who'd benefit the most), only has 4,000 caps (also 1,000 scrip, which I know are non-transferrable, and a Stalkers Explosive .50 sniper)
---
Im totally cool with them taking as long as they need but i definitely uninstalled as soon as i read this.  There's nothing to do anymore.
---
See ya in a few months!
---
&gt; Now that is canceled for now
---
Wow. I must have misunderstood English for my entire life. I didn't know that delayed meant the same as cancelled. I'm going to look this up.
---
Hmm, maybe dictionary.com is out of date. It says the definition of delay is to "put off to a later time" or "postpone". It doesn't mention the new, updated definition that means cancelled. Merriam-Webster also has this old definition. I can't believe it.
---
You know. Now that I think about it, maybe the definition never changed. Maybe it means it's coming out later than you expected, and not cancelled.
---
They said this 4 months ago. Who knows they could do the last min delay till next year because ___. I dont see myself paying anything for a private sever unless some modders release a ton of content related mods.
---
Nah you're just crazy
---
&gt; And paid private servers
---
Really don't understand how this is a shock to anyone
---
&gt;no more "only cosmetic" on atomstore.
---
Oh no! Are they going to release a p2w microwave this time?
---
☝️this.
---
I haven't played in a while. The only reason I'm still subscribed to this sub (and interested in fo76) was wastelanders. Bethesda dropped the ball.
---
And still FO76 fans will defend it
---
I was at max script last night and decided to just try my luck with two rolls. Went 3* ranged weapons, got a medics bazooka with crap &amp; crap and, a nocturnal flame thrower with crap &amp; reduced weight...i'll be back to 1000 by tomorrow.
---
No, that would mean we're currently in Q1.
---
Do these wood pieces have decent rolls and are you on PS4? I may take them off your hands if so
---
Just got bad items and not a single handmade legendary so sad.
---
I'm concerned for the game's future too, but maybe not for the reasons you outlined.  The fact that their vision for the game is not doable is some cause for alarm.  Hopefully they can right the ship.
---
BTW I don't mean to nitpick, but they never promised "cosmetic only" in the Atomic Shop.  People took an off-the-cuff comment that Pete Hines made on Twitter and ran with their interpretation of it.  Bethesda never promised that the shop would be "cosmetic only."  If you listen to Todd's early interviews about it, he said that was sort of their vision, and they wanted to be careful about how closely they walked that line into inappropriately-advantageous items.  There was a whole thread about it a couple months ago so I don't wanna rehash it, but there was never a PROMISE made by Bethesda that every single Atomic Shop item would be purely cosmetic.
---
Also, the DLC is still free.  Private Servers are a separate service.  Again maybe that's splitting hairs but servers are not traditionally seen as DLC.
---
nnnnoooooooooooooooooooo
---
Kick in the teeth? So fucking dramatic.
---
Ah nice. Random time but cool.
---
I mean yeah, to be fair sure there were a couple seasonal events and the raids. However the seasonal events were very, very small quests. The raids are, I'm sorry but pathetic. 
---
Look at a raid in a comparable game, Destiny 2, Eso, any mmorpg, take your pick. The raids we got in FO76 were pathetic by comparison, and broken on top of that with the lag when interacting with objects. If your entire character wasn't just wiped of it's gear.
---
Very strong points there that I didn’t think of. Sounds a lot like with each update BGS is just trying to milk the game as much as possible before it dies.
---
Yeah I just read the ITV my morale went down a ton I wish I hadn’t read it it’s genuinely depressing
---
[Bye, Have a Great Time!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUl9NPPMx8s)
---
I think they are fun. They are different games. The pace of fallout is much slower than a shooter like destiny. Also they hve only opened one vault. Other vaults could be different. We don’t know at this point. 
---
And I have zero worry about losing my character in the vault. It happened to one dude under extremely rare circumstances which has since been patched and he has been restored lol.
---
Didnt we pay for a working game already though? They are basicly making us pay a second time to play the game lagfree. If Bethesda had offered this as a solution to us not being able to play this game properly one year after release... I honestly dont care if it costs them money. Feels like they kind of owe it to us at this point, right?
---
Not being funny mate but genuinely curious. If you quit back when they nerfed TSE, why are you still subbed to this subreddit?
---
Edit: maybe you just like gaming. My bad, been a long day and my brains not working correctly!
---
Ah, was hoping it had been mentioned somewhere.
---
I didn't know it until now, but reading this comment was what I got on Reddit today.
---
I just got a bloodied fixer on my 3rd try but it's still missing the less vats cost :(
---
Yeah same, I'm a bloodied rifle build but I use a instigating swing speed meat hook for cleaning out low enemies on challenges / farming runs. An when you run up on something lvl 4 when you're lvl 100+ an dont kill them after 3 swings it's just like what...
---
Thanks, what kind of mutations would you recommend? Say for a heavy build, or in general
---
Its disheartening hearing the kits are the most popular thing bought in the store and people are asking for more...
---
You don't lose card. Just the stat points and the benefit from them, for example if you have -2 to strength your carry weight will be reduced but you will still be using all equipped strength perk cards that you have equipped.
---
Xbox
---
[Beth if it disappoints=Roomba](https://youtu.be/fjRWHmvYTbM?t=40)
---
Agreed completely.  Having an option to jump between private and public for me depending on my mood is quite appealing.
---
I think it's good they finally addressed non-cosmetics. Plus they said they've been the best sellers in the atom shop catergory. If the fridge is considered in that catergory, I'm pretty sure people can say they're not p2w lol
---
Why is every word in your entire post have the beginning letter capitalized?
---
I'd be interested in seeing that video and their build.
---
There is a Halloween event with rewards right around the corner
---
Yea Limb dmg on every 2nd weapon..
---
Wastelanders was what was gonna make me interested in playing the game again, now ive gotta wait even longer
---
I’ve noticed with these type of things that if you do it solo then it works way way better. If involved in a team then markers get messed up. I think cause the computer is trying to update for all players involved somehow. 
---
Anyhoo this is my workaround on pc.  I’ve done this mission for two alts in the past week.
---
I'd rather have no release date than lies. Strange how almost every other major gaming company gives realise dates months in advance and make it every time but Bethesda has never once realised anything on time in FO76. Either keep to your date or dont give one. Your experience in coding means nothing to me.
---
So we cannot host private servers on our own machines? Or we can host them on our machines but still pay for that "service"?
---
To be fair...neither of those excerpts says the Atom Shop is cosmetic only.
---
The first one just says if you don't want to spend money on cosmetics; you won't have to because they give away Atoms. It doesn't outright say, or even imply, that the Atom Shop is "cosmetic only".
---
The 2nd one talks about free DLC and very specifically says "the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works" which can easily be read to include utility items.
---
I took his statement of "the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff" as a quote of people who were saying that, and he's pointing out that there's a line of cosmetic versus P2W and they're going to work to stay on the right side of that line. Utility items come closer to that line that cosmetics, but he didn't explicitly say the Atom Shop was "cosmetic only".
---
Asking the real questions here!
---
Lvl 153 day 1 player, only thing keeping me playing this game until now was Wastelanders, now that it’s been delayed until 2020 I have no reason to play. I already have all the gear I want, never done a raid because the rewards are useless for the amount of work you put in to get them, and the PvP is an unbalanced mess. I even tried to convince some of my friends to try the game again, but now that Wastelanders is delayed I’ll advise them against redownloading, and I’ll be uninstalling it as well.
---
I haven't seen him say that. Those excerpts others have linked don't say that...
---
wait i have a better idea lets all call amazon and plead with them not to charge BGS for there servers so we can  have free servers for you guys lets see how that flys
---
No one is gonna talk about the fact that npc ghoul has been confirmed from the screenshots? This was the first thing I noticed when checking the article.
---
Paid private servers should not be a surprise to anyone....
---
It's not in the game, i was talking about the one in Fallout: New Vegas.
---
When private servers were first mentioned at the original E3 announcement, I was excited that I would be able to explore the game with my girlfriend. Now after waiting for so long they announce that we will have to pay for that privilege. It's honestly disappointing.
---
  
---
Couple that with the fact that this makes it sound like you have to pay for a private server to use mods which compounds the disappointment.
---
I get that there are concerns with client hosted servers and moving characters between the two but there has to be a better solution? Maybe allow a transfer of existing characters to client hosted servers which then wouldn't be allowed back to the official servers? Duplicating a character to a custom server and keeping the official server copy?
---
Game 100% should have been delayed, we are basically playing a game thats in its last year of development.
---
Anyone who’s dealt with all the crap this game has put the users through label me surprised.
---
Def a snyth
---
I'm sorry, but we must live on completely different worlds.  Not in my wildest imagination did I ever believe that there would be free private servers, and locally run/hosted servers is a ridiculous thing to hope for, it's never going to happen.
---
Yeah it used to be very OP with demolition expert but they had to nerf it 
---
You can install extended blade with flames attached.  Makes for a fun time
---
If you still think this game is ever getting private servers you’re in for a bad time. The way the matchmaking works is more comparable to GTA Online
---
BuT I aLrEaDy PaId MoNeY fOr ThE gAmE oNcE
---
Lucky you. I've only been getting Tea Time, Uranium Fever, Leader of the Pack, Hoard events, an then very rare get AWOL Arms. Haven't seen Campfire Tales more then once wich I wanted to do for more badges to unlock more mods.
---
Ok awesome thank you! Makes the mutation definitely worth it
---
Yup. Im out. Been a nice few months but Im not playing a game that feels like torture.
---
Did you not read it’s coming next week.... lmaoooo. Read first
---
The crashes and pip boy freezing was absolutely game breaking for me right after launch. It was frustrating enough that I put down the game for a month because I wasn’t enjoying having to constantly reload my game.
---
Saying the launch was fine is just revisionist history. The reviews were bad because the game was bad. Sales were terrible because the game was unpolished and incomplete. 
---
It’s a shame because had it launched in its current state it would have been much better received. The game is fun now but it took a LOT of work to get to where it is.
---
Nearly 1 year after launch, and they still can’t update the engine or restructure the engine and feels like we are playing a game as if it’s still in beta? If they really wanted to become profitable they would fix the games health. In return it would attract new players who could be potential atom shoppers. Milking the shrinking community with things like these isn’t the way to become profitable. 
---
There’s a game called “Rainbow six siege”. When first launched it was awful running on and old engine and had an awfully small community very quickly. But they didn’t give up, they implemented engine updates and rebuilds, kept making free DLC, listened to what the community told them and gave feedback on. 45+million players as of now with Esports and a growing player base every season. Why can’t BGS do the same and update the engine and actually listen to the community and the feedback?
---
Yeah, I think it's obvious that they ripped the bandaid off at the same time that the 50% purveyor discount started.
---
This is one of those bugs that is on the bottom of my list to fix, but still annoys me.
---
Honestly didnt read the whole post, no tl;dr. but i dont think the greivance is with paying for private servers but more BGS monetization for mods that improve game quality/stability and such and how in previous games they were free.
---
I'm right there with ya, I'm heading on now been waiting all day 😂
---
Really random time but nice.
---
It's not about the money, everyone can afford it, its about the principle behind it. Sounds to me like you're a fool with money.
---
That’s correct. October 2019 - September 2020.
---
Q1 stands for Quarter 1 or 1st Quarter, meaning the 1st Quarter of the fiscal year. One Quarter can only ever last 3 months.
---
And that’s only for the US Government. Companies can choose their own fiscal years.
---
[According to this link](https://sec.report/CIK/0001092835) Zenimax's fiscal year ends in December, so Q1 would be Jan - March. It's most likely that Bethesda has the same as the other guy thought
---
Valid point
---
I don't see how that can be read as "Atom shop is purely cosmetic". 
---
Not being Pay-to-win does not mean "purely cosmetics".
---
They should at least give people a 1 month free trial for all the shit they've put them though. I'm still salty about paying full price for the game only for it to be near half price a week or so later.
---
I seriously doubt it will even be out by Q1
---
Because I cut &amp; pasted from the title then shortened the actual title, very sorry for any triggering that was caused
---
Dang, thinking the Wastelanders update (which looks fantastic judging by the trailer) was coming out soon is what got me to reinstall the game and try again. Having done that though, the game is in a much better state than it was at launch which was the last time I had played and I am glad to be back in it. I got a couple buddies to buy it last week since it was on sale and that has made it infinitely more fun. I still look forward to the update and I'm glad Bethesda is going for quality over a rushed release.
---
 Hi glad, I'm Dad!
---
&gt; And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff.
---
This is literally saying the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff.
---
Yeah I’m not talking about that. Wastelanders was supposed to come during November-December. Now most of us will stop playing because it’s delayed 3 months. I want an event (Christmas) in that time that they robbed us of the most promising update in the games history. Unless they’re planning a 1 year event in January or something I’d settle for that. We can’t have one event between now &amp; 4 months in the future Wastelanders.
---
Everyone parrots "vote with your wallets" without realizing that there's more than one choice.
---
Yea if you dont run atleast 3 luck that's your prerogative, all the power to you. But you would need to redefine your definition of "pay to win" because there's a finite amount of food and flux you can store within those fridges and the camp/stash budget associated. Technically I would be winning harder than you because while you get a 50% reduction I get 90% and an unlimited amount of foodstuffs I could chill on my player character. So yes it does seem fair.
---
Them delaying to Q1, while disappointing, is actually a good sign Bethesda is learning from their mistakes. 
---
Everything else in this article is pure unadulterated garbage, especially regarding the atom shop.
---
Real Talk:
---
Anyone expecting something comparable to the single player DLCs is going to very likely be disappointed.
---
The "safe area" of expectation is to expect something along the lines of the sheepsquatch quest chain with some human NPCs and instancing, a ton of new bugs and exploits, and probably further delays.
---
This is seriously overhyped at this point and even if it released 100% bug free and gave everyone BJs people would still bitch.
---
[](/flutterkay)
---
Exactly? New consoles are Q4 2020 are they not?
---
Now I think something like $10 a month is fair but knowing Bethesda they're probably thinking hmmm 24 players sharing the cost, let's make it $50 to $100 a month. $2-4 per player is nothing, right?
---
Realistically if you want to guage the potential cost see what it costs for a dedicated Amazon VM 24/7 
---
Their smallest is $18 per month I think (1c/2gb) but one that could run a server for this game (4c/8g) is more like $74.
---
However, that would mean you need to drop other things to get that, ruining your build.
---
I’d say the same to you, minus the money.
---
Feel better now?
---
An estimate that was off is not a "lie."  It's a prediction based on incomplete information.  If it's off, it's off.  No one intended to deceive you.
---
Companies make release dates by half-assing their releases in order to meet the date.  Why do you think so many games are released in a half-finished state (this one included) nowadays?  It's all about the date.  The when when when when when when when that people demand.  People like you won out - so stuff is released when they estimated that it would be, not when it's actually ready to be released.
---
Well, how bout them apples.
---
Just gonna shoot my original comment a slick downvote there.
---
was that confirmed in the release? I must've missed it. 9.99 doesn't sound too bad. my concern tho... once i have a heavily modded private server and then i take a break from the game for a month or two...would i lose anything? we'll see i suppose.
---
Break time for me.
---
I've been spending a lot of time acquiring plans. Ammo reserves,  uncommon junk, and anything I might regret not having.  Also saving perk points. 
---
With Bethesda stating wastelanders would fundamentally, change the game, but providing little info than NPCS, companions,  and a few weapons,  it's tough to know what that change is gonna be.
---
Maybe a great place to get fusion cores is no longer going to provide them. Maybe that vendor will stop selling those plans. It's hard to tell, so I figured I'd stock up. (Of course this may be unnecessary). 
---
Now I'm sitting in a bunch of stuff, that I'd have been able to use or sell off in a month.  Now I have to either dump it, and reaquire it later,  or take a break. 
---
So break it is. I'm might pop on for an hour or two to check out the updates every few weeks, but otherwise, it's time to wait  offline and let Betheada finish the expansion.
---
At the current pace, I believe this game will become GTA V Online, a true, barren, cheater-filled wasteland.
---
With the new Inside the Vault suggesting private servers will be something you *have* to buy, I'm rather certain I won't be returning. 
---
I've retired from NW, forever, still better than most of the tryhards, even the level 300 currently still haunting the servers. I changed my loadout back to melee.   
---
The game has gotten better and more playable after switching to melee, but it's still boring, as hell. The only thing I can remotely do without getting bored to absolute hell is CAMP building, but good spots are rare, and there's not really any awesome items to put, and the budget thing is just annoying.
---
Nice one dude thank you
---
Oh no I was just speaking generalizations! My bad!
---
It's almost like this was the intended reaction!
---
Thanks, the BE one would be better of course, but if explosive weapons break stealth easily then I'm afraid it's not my cup of tea.
---
But would be fun to see the damage with a maxed demo expert :-)
---
I’m likely going to be moving on as well.  Without special events and survival this game has become so goddamn boring.  This morning, there were like 5 other players on the map.
---
Did you read the first line of the quote?
---
Yea I wonder why would you ever need money to run servers, like... What is this? /s
---
I'm already placing bets that they've messed with the rng roll to offset the 50% sale making it harder to get good roll items
---
Maybe w the new max strength perk available for 9000 atoms but def not standard
---
More people then you think are actually interested in Wood Armor with the correct rolls.
---
I am super super excited- going to be fun putting real effort into workshops. Without the risk of pvp you can really put time and effort into making a true base with your friends.
---
Don’t get me wrong I am not crying about pvp- I know what I am entering when I take work shop. I ain’t making it pretty due to the risk tho.
---
I'm also dreading the hit to my stash / weight ... since I'll only be able to grind back in 150 scrip worth ;-)
---
3 server hops and 17 long range pieces of shit for me!
---
I wil probably quit if that happens
---
Make sure you get starched genes (max rank) so you can keep it and not lose it when you use Radaway or a decontam shower, and get Class Freak (max rank) so that the negative effects are lessened.
---
You paid for the game with multi users on shared servers.  You didn't pay for private servers in the game.  A one time fee won't work for private servers as there are monthly costs to upkeep, and the Atom store purchases weren't meant for that either.
---
Builds, my friend, builds.
---
Bloodied gives the highest damage, but it requires you to be at low health. Other builds are slightly less effective, but still massively OP, such as junkies, anti armor, and even nocturnal.
---
Look up builds, find which one you like, and commit.
---
Lol I thought the same thing. They just going back on their plan to only sell cosmadics so they can make more money.
---
The only thing that suffers is charisma cause you won’t be able to share any of your cards if it dips under the 3 required point
---
Yeah. Exactly. I bet most people who consider it a kick in the teeth would be complaining in they released Wastelanders too soon. Those are the types of people Beth isn’t looking to keep happy anyway, because it’s impossible.
---
OMG CALM DOWN EVWRYBODY OMG SHEEEEEET JUST CALM TF DOWN
---
Edit: I read it. It's delayed lol which is fine if it's bug fixes *before* it's released.
---
This the problem with people nowadays. A company/studio can introduce anything and call it a “service” and people will dumbly go pay for it because it’s a “service”. BGS isn’t the only one using amazon servers. PLENTY of games use them and I don’t see all those games charging for servers now do we? Lazy people who would rather not question companies/studios and their shady practices are the problem and why companies/studies nowadays get away with what they want.
---
Yeah the anti material rifle is a new Vegas gun but also widely asked for by fans.
---
Delay may be good. Gives me a chance to update my system so I don’t play with plastic textures and lag every 5 seconds
---
Don't.
---
It's GTA Online, but worse. At least Online is bearable when you're solo playing.
---
Or cheating...
---
But NW is full of people that truly have no life (european level 300+ who plays every day being a prime example, most likely a cheater because he conveniently knows where enemies are) or are cheating. It's not worth it.
---
Does Supressor, Dodgy, Lone Wanderer perks %dmg reduction stacks with PA emergency protocols mod (the one with 50% dmg reduction when less than 20% hp)?
---
I guess now there really is no reason to play this game until next year.  I knew Wastelanders would be delayed but I did not expect until next year.  Regardless, I would bet dollar to donut that Wastelanders will be buggy regardless and be boring fetch quests.  And didn’t they start working on Wastelanders like 7 months ago?
---
My disappointment is immeasurable.  Thanks Bethesda.
---
Zenimax is largely at fault for this I think. Upper management is dillusional.   What else is new?
---
It's comedy friend and the comment made me laugh.  Mission accomplished 😁
---
Like we ask the bare minimum but it all gets thrown into the atom shop. The fridge could easily been a small simple quest line.
---
Everything that sells for money has priority. I wish Bethesda some good luck with selling stuff when the playerbase decreases because of the lack of new and free content.
---
this post pulled at my heart strings! congrats and good luck as a new parent!  hopefully your significant other is understanding of your humor!
---
No there holiday 2020 for ps5 basically Christmas or Jan
---
Yeah I got it for Christmas thank god so I didn’t spend my money on it. I would gladly pay $20 if it was a ONE TIME payment &amp; that’s it you get private servers forever. Or even $20 for a year. But I’ve heard people saying it’ll likely be $9.99 a month which everyone seems to say sounds reasonable &amp; idk who that’s reasonable to? I pay $10 a month for Netflix something that can give me continued entertainment (even though sometimes the TV shows &amp; movies are meh) I can still go back to it. With no more content coming until likely March (Wastelanders) there is no value in this game after the Halloween event.
---
It is* an awesome idea... but what would become of my refrigerator..? Which I paid real money that I sweated for..? Dont get me wrong. I fully agree. I just hope I wouldnt (hypothetically) have to purchase a more useful version of a device that serves basically the same purpose as what I've already bought.. 🤔
---
They basically act like F076 is a F2P game.
---
here’s the full list of mutations along with their positives and negatives
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations
---
if you’re gonna be running lots of mutations be sure to get class freak lvl 3 as it decreases negative effects by 75%
---
It's not though. It's certainly not saying it's JUST cosmetics.
---
Read it like this, because keep in mind...that article was quoting his stated words.
---
"And [for people] to say, "The Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff...". To make folks understand [what that means]...look, there's a line [between P2W and a healthy MTX shop].
---
I literally watched him speaking and when he said it, I never got the "Atom Shop is cosmetic only" from his statements and take away...
---
Every other triple A company meets their deadlines the majority of the time. Nethesda hasn't met one for FO76. At this point it's not am accident.
---
Which was a highly requested feature that nobody asked to pay for. Just trashy.
---
I knew not to get ive1r hyped man I just was thinking at least this year
---
Start saving your atoms!
---
"We are shooting for November" is not a deadline. get over it.
---
Unless sony loosened up mods won't even make it worth it on ps4 so, fuck me.
---
lol i should've checked. that's be great i'll add you
---
yeah, i see no problem paying for my own server together with my friends / team, from what i read several other games works the same way.
---
But it was sad that Wastelander is delayed, was expecting it to be though :/
---
In your private Minecraft server that you host on your own machine for free, can you take your existing lvl 465 character and loot a bloodied explosive &lt;weapon of choice here&gt; and then take it back into a public server? 
---
Okay I've made an assumption there but I'd be willing to bet I'm right that you will be able to transition your character and all you stuff between private and public. That ability alone prohibits allowing us to run the server locally. They'd either have to give us whatever they use as a database, or they'd have to let us communicate with it which would introduce latency and make everything lag worse than it already does. Not to mention you know.....cheating and spoofing god roll legendary drops. 
---
Even if they put a barrier up and our private locally hosted server was its own isolated little thing, handing that server binary out would open the door to exploits beyond your imagination that would no doubt be brought into the public servers. 
---
Sorry your expectations were not based in reality.
---
Congratulations nice one mate!
---
that was mine!
---
We will hear more. Perhaps on the day of launch. 
---
It would be a good question on balance.
---
[https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241?lang=en](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241?lang=en) read this tweet and let me know. Cause you seem to be disingenuous
---
That's just a lie from Bethesda that they use to introduce other P2W items.
---
What's pay to win in this game? What is winning? Genuine question.
---
My group will probably pitch in to rent one to specifically use for vault runs if we can even transfer characters between
---
If you never meet a single deadline in a game it becomes dishonesty. I dont see other triple A titles with this level of incompetence. Gamers who never hold the company responsible are really fucking stupid.
---
Yeah I recently switched my build up completely. Went from Sneak Sniper to a Bloodied Commando. Definitely enjoyed the change up but without much content to use it on what's the point? I've killed the Queen an done the daily's more then enough. 
---
I also truly enjoy the CAMP building but like you said the are slowly adding items an were missing some of the more unique pieces that could change up builds an stuff significantly like half horizontal walls etc. An the system is super limited in building. Still managed to build over 50 new CAMPS though. But EVERYTHING new being added for them is become super expensive an earned only through the ATOM shop. An they haven't even added anything worth it in over a month now.
---
Unfortunately i can't play the game this month  please spend script in my honor
---
I've posted a shit ton arguments for beth; regarding this and staff salaries too, and people educated me on the subject so I wanted to pass it forward: hosting servers do not cost shit. its salaries' of people and investor expectations that is pushing them forward for a more monthly pay basis game model. you might want to defend this (although I wouldn't as zenimax is just another corporation after all, and (even) as a rabid capitalist I believe no corporation deserves it), you shouldn't cite server maintenance as a reason. its not.
---
you cant restructure an engine lol its a foundation then you build on it like a house if you foundation is bad you have to wipe and restart from foundation again LOL. I agree with you that the game has issues but let me ask you how many hours have you played???? if its more than 100 stop complaining you gotten more fun than most games you play. Is it perfect no could it be better yea, but certain things will never be perfect. AND are you seriously comparing a csgo like simple game like RB6 to Fallout 76 thats like compairing peanuts and paperclips seriously... I keep hearing you talk about cost your just coming accross like a free loader that would probably complain abut a free tshirt if it wasnt the color you wanted.... or better yet incert free thing here and your complaint because you are definatly a complainer.
---
You can always tell which people have never worked on a long term project before when they start accusing developers of lying about release dates whenever a game gets delayed. It's not even just a coding/game development thing. 
---
Either that or they have no clue what lying actually means.
---
You didn’t see the constant suggestions on this sub requesting fridges?  Seriously.  Do a search.
---
Thank you! And she sure does. Been together a long time. I got me a good one that's for sure.
---
Want to sell it?
---
In the update they said more info will come. So just got to wait and see.
---
1 I'd rather it be delayed not come out a buggy half assed mess like the game started as
---
2 as far as I can tell they are not the first to charge a server fee and it's not said if you can host for yourself for free and instead buying a public one to host
---
3 it even says they will not include anything that could disrupt the game balance (even though you can earn them as well)
---
I get the massive amount of skeptics I do but try to keep an open mind about the subject. If its terrible then ok then but if it turns out good then great.
---
Same. Im over it. I consider fallout dead and its never coming back. Im moving on like a bad ex. Not my first time having to bury something I love.
---
Whoa, whoa, my car gets smashed in GTA? Might as well throw the disc in the bin now, another game's plot ruined.
---
That is actually good news. They finally understood they better release stuff that works rather than serving it half baked.
---
In the meanwhile people can find something else to do with their lives, but... Can they?
---
TS have accuracy reduction, explosive don’t...
---
If I sneak in a workshop can you see my icon on the map?
---
What if I told you, you could have both?
---
It Is in my machine for 7k. I would trade it for instigating knuckles, but haven't seen one.
---
Warframe Empyrean it is.
---
Looks like one of (or perhaps both of) two options -- 
---
1) Mods will go through a clearinghouse which will restrict what can be applied (v.likely)
---
2) Characters will not be transferrable; worlds and adventure are "different games" (almost certainly)
---
Same...
---
Boo, garbage troll, go back to your dumpster.
---
Same I've been a collector since day one. My stash is litterally full of the one time earned items an rare ones an outfits.. I cant bring myself to get rid of anything cuz like you said who knows what they will change with so little info an what items might because unobtainable.
---
I started a new character with a build completely different than my main.  It is like playing again for the first time.
---
Yeah I have a strong feeling private worlds will need a new character... purely because of the advantage it will give you and how the plan to implement mods into it.
---
Hi marketing team! Get back to work and make this game playable
---
Ugh, I really loved this game but there’s been nothing left for me to do forever. The raids were going to hold me over but they suck, haven’t played since the second one dropped and don’t plan to until some meaningful content is dropped.
---
For those of us with our own hardware to run a server on, this is a huge bummer. Aside from just getting more money, I don't see why they wouldn't let us run our own servers wherever we want, even with the restriction that private characters couldn't play on the official servers.
---
You’re having a stroke. Have someone call 911 for you.
---
I was surprised I even got it because it's what I've been trying to pull lately! Now it's time to try for a bloodied Fatman.. I've seen one once and I have regretted not buying it ever since
---
They stated it’s utility only and not to bring unbalance. 
---
But people will still cry P2W for a refrigerator 🤷‍♀️
---
LUL what LVL are you im curious
---
Nice, P2W items in a game that isn't F2P
---
Private servers will. Come?
---
I wish I could’ve given ya 2 thumbs up
---
&gt;A company meets their deadlines the majority of the time.
---
And how many of them are launching in completely broken states or straight up unfinished? Most of them. Because of people like you who throw a hissy fit and act like developers are intentionally deceiving you whenever something goes longer than planned.
---
What's he replying to? I can't find Modishnouns or blueberry_lord's question. I'm not savvy with twitter.
---
DOH!
---
There was never a question about if it was going to be free, just a few people who don't understand how things work.
---
It can't be free, and can't be self-hosted.  Those ideas just don't work, for many reasons.  It was never an option.
---
I believe that the fridge and the Collectron sold well—they’re everywhere—and I’m ok with those, they’re more novelty than anything and people did want things like that. I don’t believe that the scrap or repair kits sell well at all, unless they’re fudging the numbers with the ones that are included in the popular $10 Atom/Outfit bundles.
---
Sorry so late yes I had to re-launch my game
---
I can definitely see it going on gamepass if enough people start paying for private servers. One can hope at least!
---
Ohhhh so THATS what happened? I drank too many Nuka Cherry!
---
Looks like I'm right
---
It was never really a question, just some people don't understand how things work.
---
People are gonna throw a fit about that too, I'll guarantee it
---
"What do you mean I have to start over!!!"
---
Wait so private servers will be a paid service, and Bethesda is offering mod support for these servers?
---
Lol Slick Bethesda
---
Hell yes . Three questions, if I pay for a server, can I invite my friends to play there so they don't have to pay?
---
How much ? And when can I give you the money.
---
I thought it was some sort of code. I have wasted this sticky note.
---
No need to buy a server from them if you have the hardware to do it yourself or want to set it up on something like AWS.
---
Just what I was thinking, although going for bloodied unarmed...
---
&gt;I dont see other triple A titles with this level of incompetence
---
Really? Because I see plenty of AAA developers who launch their games in completely broken or unfinished states just to meet the release date, or delay their games as well.
---
will do good sir, will do
---
Should I *really* have added the fact that we have standards?  
---
You're an idiot on purpose.
---
They wanted it as an in game thing no one asked for it in the atom shop
---
I just use psycho and alcohol for big fights, that's about it
---
It is apparently [already sold on the Creation Club](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Anti-materiel_rifle_%28Creation_Club%29) in Fallout 4.
---
Wait... So I did the one that actually had different locations, for the Forest, but the rest didn't have locs and I was confused... So all I had to do was take Photomode pics *anywhere* in those other regions?? **Smacks forehead**
---
They are understaffed and overstressed I bet.  They've been dropping the ball for a year now and their management is poor in the decision making department.  A delay is fine but the base game is broken AF still.  Crashes, DCs, social menu fucked to hell, etc.  Ya. I'm fine with content delays but it's hard to live with some of these bugs on a game less than a year old.
---
Statistically speaking yes, but if the goal is to just stretch your scrip as far as possible while hunting for a BE handmade, then 2* is best because the third effect is generally just "Nice to have" rather than "I need it to function"
---
Another Bethesda never has to keep their word and can do no wrong sympathizer. Why am I not surprised?
---
I'm getting a bit bored sometimes and I don't think I will keep playing till the delayed release of the Wastelanders DLC and Bethesda's decision to add more P2W items in the future.
---
That's not how you treat loyal customers.
---
You're right on weightless. But on the second point you seem to have chameleon and cloaking confused.
---
Chameleon is when you do the entire invisible thing. Cloaking is when something hits you, you get a brief bit of invisible.
---
Don't think your the only one with bad rolls, well not according to on here and on the fb communities I've just read.
---
Seems everyone is in the same boat, I'm thinking they've tweaked the rng chance to offset the 50% off
---
I had first started in Beta, played on and off up to around level 105 or something. But I haven't played for a couple months now, and I'm just going to continue to not play if bugs aren't goimg to be fixed. Aren't events still screwed up??
---
That’s my concern. I love this game and have spent a ton of time with it. I’m looking forward to new content, but I absolutely will not support those kinds of tactics and really hope I don’t ha e to walk away.
---
Everything has a price my dude, you want something, you have to pay for it. I don't see the problem there.
---
Yup lol
---
Well people kept buying the stuff so they would be correct to think so.
---
These are dedicated servers, and they cost money on Bethesda's part. Battlefield does exactly the same.
---
Peer-to-peer servers (like all GTAO servers) are hosted by players' machines, this makes them free to host, but they come with drawbacks. The biggest issue with peer-to-peer servers is latency (or lag) on the guests' part. This gives an advantage to the host because there is virtually no latency on the host's part. This may be ok for co-op and non-competitive games though.
---
The most probable reason they went with dedicated servers is so that we are able to use our characters in them.
---
When mod support comes out, they will most likely include peer-to-peer servers because we probably won't be able to use our characters in them because of the potential of mods giving us advantages. It is also easy to cheat in peer-to-peer servers, especially as a host (this is why almost every server in GTAO has at least 1 cheater).
---
Also, some people think that everyone has to pay to play on a private server, but that is not the case. The only person who pays for the service is the host, not the guests.
---
This is a much needed addition and it will bring more players to the game. I am glad they decided to release it sooner than Wastelanders.
---
This is more than just a quality of life feature. People with color blindness basically have to hack their game to be playable.
---
They also weren’t online. They were single player.
---
I honestly think about ARK and the way its private servers work. But you may wanna consider tagging OP as idk if he’ll be notified or see your comment for a bit unless he religiously checks the post
---
Client side hosting would have been far better for consumers but instead they went the faster payment route. Disappointing.
---
Fuck me, you're right. I was exaggerating with the last week thing but I swear all the Responders stuff happened just a few months before Reclamation Day but I guess I was way off.
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
Wow. Bethesda now knows about The Doc
---
Where are they getting the feedback from all these people, if not the biggest forum in the world? Where they’re active every week?
---
If you referring to a pistol build then as a lvl 247 I advise strong to change you build while you can as with testing on scorchbeast queen I do little damage with pistols but am A GOD with a rifle and melee!!!
---
it's pretty fun. you get the thrill of shredding enemies but the risk of dying. non-bloodied, I'm near invincible and it takes way to longer to kill stuff. less risk, less reward, less fun
---
Mayor for a Day
---
I agree, I alway preferred blue over green. Dont know why tho
---
It would be standard if the public servers had little to no reasonable lag but with the amount of disconnects and lag drops, you'll be paying just to enjoy a lagless experience
---
&gt; We are shooting for November" is not a deadline. get over it.
---
With a possibility to delay the launch with 3-6 months.
---
How to lose customer loyalty in 3.2.1...
---
Oh really? Nice! I never even look at the computer anymore lol Maybe I should give it a look.
---
Yes and no....I mean we paid for an online game not a finished one and done story. This is an on going game that is evolving over time and we are receiving free content and free dlc. I'm not complaining. I paid $60 but I'm getting years of content. And I don't have to pay any other money for content if I don't want to. Atoms are earned in game and private servers are optional.
---
The nerfs were way overkill.
---
Demolition expert also got a huge nerf which made explosives even less viable than they already were.
---
Side note: I don’t think dupers ever deliberately crashed servers. The old “board” method everyone new about just kicked the duper from the server so they could rejoin and pick up their duped item. Not that it makes it any better. I’m sure it made servers more unstable for everyone.
---
I have encountered problems like this on my PC in the past when any 3D surround features were enabled on my audio system (e.g. - Spatial Sound, Windows Sonic for Headphones, etc.). Disabling these enhanced modes might help you too.
---
Agreed, ETA’s are supposed to be as accurate as possible, I understand companies don’t account for certain things and run over the deadline but Bethesda do it EVERY time therefore lose the integrity of everyone who has supported them.
---
Client side hosting. You know like most games allow now a days? Worlds goes up when you log on and goes down when you log off.
---
what were you looking for?
---
Rng
---
I was focused mostly on badges for a while; most other ones were incidental, or if I saw I could knock out an easy one every now and then. Most of what’s rest are the robot ones.
---
Boy did you pick the wrong day for that question.
---
mostly you need good legendaries. as everyone says, bloodied is no joke. there are serveral perks and mutations that make bloodied weapons even more powerful. it will blow your two-shot weapons out of the water
---
Also lol I don't think the "pay kit" protest worked too well my guy, they came out with useless fridges that reduce spoil rate by only a little (p2w apparently) and also scrap collector robots who pick up mostly useless scrap
---
Possibly. I’ve not pre-ordered it myself, I’ll be interested to see the reviews first. But you’re right about keeping people on board. I’ve pretty much played since launch and am now feeling it’s a real grind. After I’ve burnt some scrip on 50% I’ll take a break. Got some Gran Turismo to catch up on, plus the small matter of the game I put on hold to play FO76, which was RDR2...
---
My problem is that I don't have any faith it won't still be a buggy mess full of crashes and unplayable missions and every other problem that has plagued this game since launch.
---
I'm sure it will be *better* but with the state the game is currently in and based on every previous update or content patch for this game, I think it will still be borderline unplayable.
---
Hey thank you, glad I could help influence a future build.
---
I like how you're adding text in to change what he was saying. Good job.
---
There are a few games that let you be the host, but they're nothing like the scope of 76.  You can't believe a peer-to-peer setup running on some guy's personal rig is going to hold up as well as 76's servers on AWS - and even *those* have troubles sometimes.
---
Imagine how responsive 76 would be if it was running on an i5 laptop in some kid's basement on Mom and Dad's DSL line.
---
Who wanted more utility items in the atomic shop? Maybe I am uninformed but I've heard people only complaining about the utility items. I think this is a bad move, I get the fact that you release free dlcs and you need to get your money back (it's a business after all) but I think this is just one more step towards pay2win. I want to be able to find plans for a goddamn fridge while doing dungeons or exploring, not paying for it.
---
Like a reese's peanut butter cup, but instead of peanut butter it's filled with poo.
---
Stalker's Bash Damage 250+ DR while reloading Broadsider.
---
The people complaining should be paying attention to their teacher and not Reddit.
---
This can happen if you arent logged off safely
---
The game apparently can roll back your character if your game profile isnt saved properly.
---
Not me, others on this subreddit
---
Example: 
---
Bought a gun from someone from the previous night. Logged off for the night, reblogged and the gun is missing.
---
Redditors explanation: game files not saved cause a roll back
---
Literally anything that's TSE like ever other player I see. TSE combat shotgun, laser rifle, lever action, bolt action, literally anything that's actually useful
---
Ugh, killing a thousand plus, all the different ways... It's a slog.
---
The community asked for all this stuff in the game but it just got added to the atomic shop.
---
Delaying every single one of your full priced games or *years* worth of broken and unfinished games is nothing compared to Fallout 76 having delayed patches? Okay. I don't see how any rational person could think that, but you don't sound like a very rational person.
---
Bethesda were never going to win here. They delay the release of wastelanders they get criticised but if they had just released it half assed they would have got critised. If people hate this game so much then why play it???? Yes there are bugs and there are issues but overall I really enjoy the game which surely is the main thing here. Give them a chance if the update is as big as they say then it will take time to get right.
---
I would pay real money for next year's DLC not wastelanders just what ever they plan to do after wastelanders  
---
Maybe a small map of Kentucky or Ohio to hint to the next fallout coming in 9 years or wherever the fallout comes out
---
oh what a comeback darn my felings are hurt who should i go complain about the bad man who said something harsh.... please so you have enjoyed the game then you got your money's worth no? if you dont like what they are doing then "STOP BUYING THEIR DAMN GAMES" its simple if you dont support something then dont support it. If you feel this is a common thread with BGS then move on dont complain about things that really shouldnt be complained about. Companies are here to make money not make you happy sorry its a sad truth and im sorry im breaking it to you here.
---
Any thoughts / updates on crossplay?  If we are paying for our own private worlds, then we should be allowed to invite our cross-platform friends to them.
---
I’d like to see how many “new players” they bring when they loose them faster than they gain them and they don’t exactly have a good reputation of being able to run servers before they crash or just get plagued with extreme lag
---
They got buffed with the introduction of vault raids. Specifically the poison damage on melee attacks.
---
No. I'd rather them just be honest and not give fake dates in order to keep people around and then delay last minute every single time. Also, its NEVER polished so dont hold your breath.
---
Lol you genuinely made me spit my drink out with laughter
---
Man I love HAVING TO PAY MONEY FOR PRIVATE SERVERS. We cant host our own worlds nope we gotta pay.
---
I... kinda expected this. It's a revenue stream they need open, and they have the unused Survival servers laying around.  
---
Plus... doing this early might allow them to test out the instancing  problems.  because if they can't fix that, Wastelanders will be DOA.
---
Statistically the random numbers aren't so random when it's 1k of heavy junkies weapons
---
WHYYYYYYYYYYY
---
Dev teqmis probably a skeleton crew
---
Haha, glad to have made you laugh!
---
How about they let us *our* machines handle *our* own worlds by letting us hosting *our* dedicated servers just like in Minecraft, Starbound, Arma, Terraria, Team Fortess 2, Left 4 Dead 1/2, *Doom*, and many other games that have multiplayer?
---
I’ve only played about three months level 175 and I would be happy if they fix the server crashes in the last week.  I’ve crashed after looting the Queen about three times in a row now and you lose all loot and credit when you log in.  It’s not my damn connection either when I log back in I see the other players that I killed the Queen with loading in too pissed off.
---
Blah
---
The kits sell in their discounted atom sale packs. They have been padding the numbers for months just to lie about this shit.
---
Yea, let us allow people from anywhere around the globe, who might be playing on a toaster to host servers on a game that is already unstable as it is.
---
What a brilliant idea! Have you ever played Warframe?
---
Hate to break it to you, controlling your stash is the end game.
---
A fair point.
---
I just started playing this week and I've been doing fine. I've won 7 games solo.
---
The problem is that public servers have serious lag issues and asking people to pay again to play with little to no lag is ridiculous
---
So? They're still weapons. They aren't skins, they're a weapon with its own skin. You can't apply that "skin" to your weapons. Its a shitty pre-cursor for whats to come.
---
Thanks! appreciate it. I think its going to be super useful for a lot of enemies. I was already doing a rifleman/vats/crits build. With my unyielding armor i get almost 400 AP.  Right now its almost as strong as my lever action as well(tho i use lever as a sniper) 
---
Plus combined with Gun Fu/Adreliene it might turn into my go to gun for mobs. Who knows im testing this all tonight, never cared for pipe weapons til now haha thanks for the support, this is why i love the game!
---
Attack the arguemt not the person. Well, unless you're just an absolute neanderthal.
---
We’ll fight in the shade.
---
True dat. Did you get anything good?
---
Note that this only works with the bolt action pipe gun, there might be another weapon that accepts the same 2 kinds of perk cards but this is the only one that I know.
---
Another weapon that accepts 2 different damage perk cards is the meat hook, which accepts the brawler and gladiator perk cards.
---
* The Last of Us Part II
---
* Final Fantasy VII Remake
---
* Watch Dogs: Legion
---
* Doom Eternal
---
That's a quarter I wouldn't call "dead".
---
If you're keeping things, maybe you're keeping too much. If you're selling things, maybe your prices are too high
---
Wastelanders was the only thing that I was excited about. I wil probably play less now or even stop playing if there won't be any new content till Q1 2020 (seasonal events excluded).
---
Releasing the server code with all its potential vulnerabilities to the larger public is a can of worms for everyone that intends to carry on playing vanilla.
---
'Free' is not necessarily 'best for consumers'. Is all relative.
---
Well, I guess I’m walking everywhere now.
---
no :\^(
---
I know i feel sad as well but therebis hope
---
Hi walking everywhere now., I'm dad.
---
Oh cry a river you commie, Liberty Prime stands for capitalism, democracy and freedom.
---
Hosting servers costs money, they let us know ages ago that they would be hosting them. Not sure where the unnecessary rage and fake surprise comes from
---
I was so blind this entire time, the stash IS THE BOSS
---
Sounds like you’ve never played a game.
---
No worries it’s all wait and see! Lol. Good luck man!
---
Yeah, bethesda is not really coherent in how they show dead people. Taggerdy looks brand new (died in '95) while some people who died  in locked bunkers (Senator Blackwell ) are full on naked skeletons.
---
&gt;While we had many ideas on what to add to the Atomic Shop, one of the ways was the direct result of the community’s feedback. We heard from many of you who wanted items with some real utility. Starting in April, we began adding items such as Repair Kits, Scrap Kits, the Collectron Station, and a working Refrigerator. These have since become the most popular category in the Atomic Shop. We’re also still working on all the previously announced items and new cosmetic categories.
---
L M F A O
---
WHAT THE FUCK??
---
Here's hoping it at least has custom settings so you can do things like add your own multipliers or initiate events.  If it's literally just a server with a password, then fuck it.  Some people will have a use for that but nearly everyone interested in private servers won't.  Private servers also better force standalone characters - for some reason I doubt they've thought that through.
---
Sounds like you just came down your tree yesterday.
---
You're avoiding answering the question. Given the option, would you rather they delay and improve quality of the end product or release an unfinished product to meet an arbitrary date?
---
We can make already make Jars - the science project thing for capturing frogs. Those would be perfectly awesome!
---
I expected public servers not to be laggy since I paid for a triple A quality game. Excuse some of us who still have a brain watching their wallet.
---
Waaah waaah waaah! I wanna have it my way.... waah waah waah! *stomps feet*    Bethesda will add what they , when they want and how they want. You can request, not dictate !
---
Usually one person rents the server, cheapest ones are usually 10 slots so whomever pays for the server + 9 friends they can invite to play on the server who don't have to pay. I know for like Ark and Conan Exiles it's $13 a month for ten slots, there are more options for more cost.
---
As i already said in a post six month ago...  [Link to post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bd1dnm/repair_kits_are_pay_for_convenience_not_pay_to/ekv2a58/?context=3)  it was clear that all these suggested furniture would have come as a pay for convenience items.
---
"A delayed game is eventually good. A rushed game is bad forever." -Shigeru Miyamoto
---
Even in the age of patches and updates, a game getting a bad launch kills the reputation of the game to a point where even after fixes, some wont be willing to give it a chance. 76 itself laumched way too early imo, so i for one am thankful bethesda is making the call to take more time to work on this FREE update so that it works properly, rather than them just getting it out the door in an unplayable state because "deadlines". I dont need wastlanders NOW, i need wastlanders to be GOOD.
---
Thinking of starting up a harpoon/missile launcher shop myself.
---
True!
---
Any Junkie's Faster Fire Rate heavy weapons? I might be interested.
---
Disappointed.
---
Same with PVP. Its just that the survival mode nerfs affected dmg numbers so badly that even with bloodied handmade I struggled to take down a player without VATs headshots. You needed to empty the entire clip into them with crit headshots to kill, if you could. If you didn't kill them in one clip they outpaced dmg with stimpacks and aid. 
---
BUT thankfully the nerfs are old news. I do think it's strange that they never applied them to adventure mode PVP though. This may be tin foil hat talk but I think that they did that to get people to stop playing survival mode since they planned to take it down for wastelanders anyway. If they thought it would really improve PVP they would have applied it to adventure mode as well. I wish they would have left it alone, kinda messed with my reflexes for a while. It even effected me in other games!
---
Guess who got you nose 
---
Bobby no nose does
---
Now they officially confirmed that they re-evaluated that. Anything from now on won't be lying...
---
Wow imagine being this toxic in person.
---
the only things i keep nowadays in my stash is legendaries because of the god damn scrip limit
---
and Randy Savage deathclaws and Sheepsquach
---
Im curious since they say largest ever done, is that done for Fallout in general or just this game cause so far the stuff done has been so small.
---
sorry, i know pc is master race but i don't have the funds. but thank you kind sir.
---
DennisFrogman on XBL, I sold the junkie items bc I've never known anyone who used them and I wanted more scrip. Come check out my small arsenal if you're looking for anything else - and selling TSE weapons I'm griping about
---
BL3 has to have put a dent into FO76 as well. Totally different styles of games granted, but BL3 scratches certain itches in an overall much more polished package.
---
The biggest turnoff for me with FO76 is the RNG aspect of loot grinding; which ultimately made the end game profoundly unfun. You cant go to specific bosses and expect specific items to drop after X runs. That's grindy but it has an aspect of inevitability. FO76 is a crap shoot, in addition to having to constantly to scavenging loops and the like to collect ammo, and all of the stuff like server hopping, perk card swapping, etc that goes with it.
---
Right, you don't need that many Legendaries
---
 Hi griping, I'm Dad!
---
Sorry i really don't understand wat your saying
---
my nemisis, inventory control
---
That's the key. Salvagetron brings me more joy with his quips compared to the junk, but he does bring me junk.  The fridge... i still think is useless and didn't buy it.  But it adds utility to some people.
---
I haven't bought any repair kits, but not going to lie, the Scrap kits are useful.  
---
Now, a thought about how it says they want to make the game better for everyone... I'm hoping that some of these items are like the Canner idea - new crafting that people buy, but anyone who visits your camp can use.
---
 Hi hoping, I'm Dad!
---
I don't get why anyone is surprised.
---
I’m totally for it. Having a server for 4 people vs 24 people will result in a more stable server experience all on its own
---
I got both but to this day I don't stand a chance in pvp against TSE cunts and I got the unyeilding setup as thick as it gets
---
Brackets are commonly used to fill in quotes when pronouns are used or things are referenced elsewhere, such as with gestures, within the question asked, in previous statements, etc.
---
When I added "[for people]", it was obvious he wasn't talking about himself because he was talking about others saying "The Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff..."...something he hadn't previously stated anywhere. It was obvious he was talking about other people saying that.
---
I didn't change what he said. I'm clearing up what VGR failed to do; quote him correctly.
---
After he said "To make folks understand..." He clearly stopped whatever he was about to say and then said "Look..." as a redirect. He abandoned that line of thought entirely. Then went into his explanation of what a good system is versus a bad one.
---
I'm not changing anything. It was how I interpreted it and the VGR quote is terribly quoted based on what he said, how it was said, who was there, and what was being talked about. They literally just typed what he said into words, without any of the nuance needed to properly interpret it.
---
Then act surprised when it does go under. There's no reason to kill the fanbase. The game series always had a lot of potential.
---
 Hi clearing, I'm Dad!
---
It's fucking bullshit
---
I am expecting similar results on 2 toons that have around 600 scrip each..
---
F!
---
In that case , could call our kids children of atom?!
---
I bought a fridge for the Arktos look, haven't grinded crafting stuff to use it yet :(
---
You wish will surely be granted
---
Hey Dad do you have any TSE weapons to sell me?
---
Oh yeah very true! But that should be pickling haha
---
Not worth arguing with people like that :/
---
They just want something to complain about.
---
 You are on a Club and dont want to be in the dancefloor with other people, so you MUST pay for a VIP area and then invite your friends, thats how the world works, simple.
---
Not paying for private servers when my PC can host a world just fine 😩
---
Prepare for the worst and you can be surprised...maybe
---
With an at lest 3 months long delay you can damn well expect players to drop out well before Wastelanders.
---
I think factions will help bridge the divide between pvp and pve players. Because at least the. The violence is directed lol. You can’t be a responder in the mountains and not expect to get shot by raiders.
---
They could have put the plan on lists for already existing quests possible rewards and put it in special vendors. Meat Week would have been the perfect opportunity to introduce it
---
These are the questions I want to be answered.
---
I think with number 2, stash and camp will not go up unless that character is locked to that server. Otherwise, it would create issues when switching to an official server.
---
Im really, really hoping that we will have customization options; soon, if not at launch.
---
&gt;  It was how I interpreted it
---
And there we go. You interpreted it differently from how he was quoted. So, you're making shit up.
---
I'm glad they've pushed back the release to give it some more polish, but the atom shop changes...yikes. The fridge and robot are popular because we've been asking for those since the beginning. Instead of saying "Oh, I guess they did really want those." though the conclusion is "Of course they want us to break our promise to keep microtransactions cosmetic only."
---

---
Already got it, its not bad, FO4 just got pretty boring after a while, probably will get back into it later.
---
So why do you play if you want to wait one more year?
---
At least they admitted that they lied to us about cosmetic only.
---
since you're never wrong my man, I won't talk about how a possible everyone-joins-pay scenario for private servers will outpay every single fucking dollar beth has to pay to host a server from amazon by proving numbers and stuff, which are all over the internet btw you can find at least the base numbers, which are not huge.
---
 Hi dad., I'm Dad!
---
Well, i do to get scrip since nowadays the legendary enemy spawns are slowly getting worse and worse.
---
Hopefully someone will figure a way to do it, just like people did with FiveM for GTAV, though the servers there were P2P.
---
Releasing Wastelanders around this time would put it up against Red Dead coming to PC anyway so it's not a very smart business move.
---
I had 1000 and spent all on 3* ranged weapons. I got lucky and got a TSE gatling gun , QE hunting rifle with faster crit fill, a quad FFR crossbow with reload speed, a junkies FFR 10mm SMG,  a vampire tesla with limb damage and reduced weight
---
10 mm is 3.24077929e-07 picoParsecs
---
^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)
---
I for one was expecting local hosting to been how they did it, do hope they add that as a option before mods at least.
---
Exact same! Thank God for pursuits right?
---
that's actually a really good and apt description.  A splintered bullet would also have worse accuracy.
---
🙃
---
At least the were being cautious about adding p2w shit, but now they're just going to go full force it sounds like.
---
Yeah, hated them so much they bought a bunch of them.  
---
Of course the direction comes from corporate.  But it was said when the repair kits came out that it was a test to see if anyone would buy them. Obviously people did.  So they went with the fridge to see what would happen. Low and behold, despite "the community" hating them, people bought it in droves.
---
lol!  I’m going to call him that when we get home.  He’s a teen and loving FO76 and we’re having a great time running around together.
---
Oh and Grats on the little one on the way.
---
im on pc
---
The top comments to this post are all defending it.
---
Probably more likely a response to duping, to give everyone a chance to get better gear "legally"
---
Oh big true, you got me there. You need it for scrip. Maybe pick up some armor with wwr? V important for us heavy traders/food builds
---
No, it isn't. I can host Ark and Rust servers on my own computer, or one of several in my home.
---
Instead of dealing with some "Service provider" and paying for absolute-minimum grade hardware, we should be able to use what we already own.
---
I've hosted Killing Floor 1/2, Minecraft, Ark, Rust, Chivalry, Mordhau, DayZ, CS/TF2/Gmod, Morrowind[Tes3MP], Terraria... The list goes on. It isn't par for the course, it's the exact opposite. For every game that forced paid for servers there are probably 20 that don't
---
&gt;The wastelanders delay would be fine if we had some actual things to do in the three months between now and then, but we haven't had any real adventure mode content updates since late spring.
---
It does suck, but it's not surprising. Just go play something else until it comes out. That's what I'll probably do.
---
&gt;The paid for private worlds are a kick in the ribs, they could have done a more p2p or such approach but instead they broke the free DLC promise.
---
Private servers aren't "new DLC content", they are an additional service. Charging for them is par for the course for games like these.
---
&gt;And the atom shop 2 is the most worrying. The cosmetic only promise has been completely tossed aside, and I wouldn't be surprised to see things like scrip packs or stash upgrades retailing for $8+ in the near future.
---
Are we still getting mad about the cosmetics thing? They started adding convenience items months ago, I don't know why people keep throwing out Hine's comment as if Bethesda's just going to remember months down the road "lol oops, we forgot it was cosmetics only, sorry". If it's more of the same stuff they've added so far, it really isn't a big deal. Wake me when they start selling TSE weapons or scrip.
---
&gt;I'm sure Juicehead and YungYea are currently filming their hate train videos as I type this.
---
Literally who gives a shit?
---
Oh sweet!
---
http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kKdgdeuO2M08M/giphy.gif
---
I sold my TSE Hangmade ages ago. I play a Bloodied build now an have zero issues vs these TSE gods your talking about..
---
Ghoul NPCs confirmed!!!!
---
What about all the existing mason jars and canning rings that exist in game? What we need to craft are the lids, as those are one time use. Like ammo, right? 10 steel and 2 rubber and 1 adhesive makes 30 lids
---
Which is fine, I'm not faulting them or crying fowl. Just don't want to pay anymore so I'll stick with public.
---
its not a reference when you capitalize two words my man
---
The article states that this is the biggest expansions that they have ever done, I'm assuming towards every game they made. I'm expecting this to be larger than Far Harbor, since Wastelanders has been in development for over a year. Fallout 4 story DLC's typically take six months of development to complete.
---
Outer space, The Wild Wild West and then the Future for me.
---
I did ok. Nothing amazing. Couple of decent Fixers, some bloodied stuff, but nothing that wowed me. Most annoying thing I was getting a few bloodied items then the server crashed, next server started giving me nocturnals...
---
 Hi assuming, I'm Dad!
---
dang i would of thought one of the new things they added was a good way to farm legendaries, i hope they allow us to re roll at some point its so hard to get weapons to try out different builds in this game and theres so many options for builds it would be great.
---
No. You're asking me to choose from 2 options when neither is true.
---
If someone who works for a company makes a statement about their products on a public space and large platform(while on the payroll), it's considered a statement by their company.
---
No so much a scatter-shot, but a splintered bullet that breaks once inside
---
They are a skin. That’s like saying the nuke cola backpack isn’t a skin because you craft it directly. You just craft the skinned weapon directly. It’s still a skin lol.
---
I play as bloodied build and I guess I wouldn't mind being able to get through the boards of enemies without 1 hit kills
---
The skill (strategy?) in that situation is avoiding being vats with stealth, positioning or appropriate cover. If I'm caught out in the open like that I am dead already imo. I try to avoid that at all costs because you never know what weapon your opponent has. 
---
That's not to say that aim is not an important skill! It's still very important especially when your opponent knows the vats mechanics really well and knows how to make it difficult to vats them. Or when they stealth boy. In some situations vats will slow me down, can't always rely on it.
---
I'm not trying to be argumentative I swear!! I see where you are coming from and I know lots of people that prefer to not use vats, or not feel like they have to use vats.
---
It's not just Wastelanders delayed too. Its perk loadout, legendary perks an more..like everything is delayed.
---
Hate =/ negative criticism. Learn the difference.
---
Every game makes you pay for private servers. Why is anyone surprised with this. Be thankful it's available for consoles. It isn't an option with several games.
---
Relax, if you don't want to pay for it, don't. No one's forcing you.
---
Geez.
---
Really? Dang... I was trying to be a stealth PA user
---
Now you're just grasping at straws.
---
As opposed to how you interpreted it differently from how he was misquoted? So you're making shit up?
---
I'm not coming out of left field with the interpretation. It's basic English shit. People don't say "And to say..." and then say something original that they just came up with. It's OBVIOUSLY something that's already been said. That alone changes the entire context of what he's talking about.
---
He's talking about something that someone other than himself said...and you are acting like he made the statement himself.
---
"How dare you spend money on something you enjoy".
---
And the "Principle" of it? How about not putting up with assholes in adventure? Worth it to me.
---
I had to craft a new set of L45 Excavator PA with calibrated shocks to endure it since im a PA build, this is a god damn crisis.
---
Dint say the name. Im still innocent. No crimes have been commited in this subreddit.
---
Exactly. I kind of wanted our new fridge to be the cooler we put those greens in for meat week tbh.
---
I seriously doubt there will be any kind of link between the public servers and the private ones.  No transfers of any kind.  Probably not even between private servers, but I can at least see how that would be *possible* to do without breaking everything.
---
That is, unless there is no difference between the public and private servers - the 'owner' doesn't have access to be able to mod items, change spawn rates, or add/change anything of substance.  So you won't be bale to take your character to a server where every mob is a 3 star level 68 with 1 hp and vendors sell every combination of legendary gear for free, then jump back to Bethesda's servers.
---
Weird, the description says its a weapon huh. If it was a skin, why not sell it as a skin?
---
I don't think they will add actual weapons or new armors through the atomic store as that is a blatant pay to win but I can see them adding the converters and other utilities to the store.
---
Make the fire blue
---
you are man, you are. I can't wait for OW!
---
I will be more than happy to share some of this terrible burden this million dollar company has. Then we could finally get stable servers. But apparently they won't let me.
---
One thing's for sure: I'm not RENTING any of their terrible servers, are u kidding me.
---
*exploiter*!
---
Happens quite often. Wait another 20 seconds before joining a new sever. Its obvousily gonna slot you into empty servers. So if you just left one an there was a spot open it will toss you back. It's not designed to give you a new one each time.
---
*me staring at Bethesda rep in the eye like a lunatic*
---
You better polish that dlc, boy
---
*me leaning closer and whispering*
---
I want to see it f@ckin sparkle...
---
The description says is a skin... the invader says it’s a combat knife and is under skins in the atomic shop lol
---
The latter is quite literally what is happening. Same thing is happening with Paradox and Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Why don't you go complain about that?
---
Id rather wait than be presented with something half finished. There are plenty of good games coming out in the meantime to fill the time. I love fallout and I never jumped on the hate wagon but I know if they released it now it would would be a buggy catastrophe.
---
Everything they have delayed has still been broken so it makes no difference
---
That can be done without “human” NPCs
---
There is literally no reason not to though except squeezing more money out. They aren't doing a DAMN thing for the people who bought the game at full price during release. At this point with all the crazy bugs and shit that has happened the least they could do is allow us to have self hosted private servers.
---
i got a question will we also have to pay to join private servers? Or only to create them.
---
Bingo. Offer a standalone server like mincraft and ark as well as an option to rent servers from bethesda.
---
Won't stop the outrage videos on YouTube by people who don't play the game.
---
Hey Dad, if you're not going to be funny, can you atleast be useful?
---
Take your time please. Fallout games and bugs are synonymous.  I'm not knocking Bethesda because this isn't even a Bethesda exclusive trait, Fallout games have been buggy since the beginning of time, and the larger the games have become, the buggier they tend to be.
---
Just make sure you iron out the most egregious issues before release, and we should be just dandy.
---
Other than that, I hope reworking the challenge system for Atoms makes it so that it's easier to earn Atoms, or Atom shop prices are made a little more fair since at the moment everything is very expensive considering how you have to earn Atoms.
---
Also, I couldn't help but notice the wording for "*Even more so, we want systems that allow players who do choose to buy Atoms to make the game better for others*".. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like there's going to be some single-use group items coming to 76, like lunchboxes that give something to everybody in proximity or something with that kind of wording.
---
I have no involvement in those. The "other people are doing it too" argument doesn't make it right.
---
They said in the article that they're rethinking their cosmetic only approach.
---
To me that means anything is game now, sooner or later.
---
They haven't even added anything new besides a raider skin in the past month. Everything else has been re-released reskins / recoloring.
---
Did you miss the "ran with their own interpretation" part of my sentence?
---
Even in his off-the-cuff remark, he never promised that all Atomic Shop items would be cosmetic only forever and always.
---
Check again. Its a weapon, and you can't have a legendary version of it.
---
"The Invader is a weapon in Fallout 76."
---
How is being able to play alone P2W?
---
i got a pretty good tommygun be +1 ag and some other medium things
---
Yet the argument that it will inherently be more polished does, which you refuse to admit.
---
Show me where the word "promise" was used by Bethesda and I'll agree.
---
True, I don't think anything can stop that.
---
Paid mods are necessary. Imagine making a mod like in 4 where you can put whatever legendary effect on a gun or armor you want. Or cheat rooms/dev room access.
---
Got 400 scrip saved up, at work so can't test til I get home but have never gotten anything worthwhile from her, hopefully it changes
---
The invader says it’s a combat knife... what “weapons” are you talking about?
---
lulz.  jackass
---
An offline play ,dedicated server or peer to peer option would be fantastic.
---
That's awesome man!
---
Welcome to AAA gaming in 2019 is all I can say.
---
No prob hoss glad we could get this hissy out of the way
---
Delay does not automatically equal more polished. Absolutely incorrect.
---
no, too busy wanting her outfit.
---
u/ladydevann  
---
Bethesda, you guys remember this is a buy to play game right?  Not a Free to play game.  
---
As such, free to play cash shop practices have NO business being here.  (Convenience items in Shop)  
---
We paid 60 dollars for this game.  This very buggy and broken game.  
---
Stuff like Fridges, Salvagers or any other convenience items should be recipes we find and learn, not items we pay to win.  Remember how Fallout 4 had it, we never paid for these things.  
---
A Cash shop like this has no business being in a buy to play game.  
---
Dont lie to what little community you have left and act like its okay to take back your word on the Cash shop.  Dont go Full EA on us.
---
Lol just pay for a private server
---
You may be right, that would be cool in many ways. I'd put my money on the other side of the table though.
---
Putting that wall up would require maintaining a separate database for each private server. Everybody that played on a new private server would have to start a new character. Sure there are people who would be fine with that, but they would not be the majority.
---
This is a monetary play and in order for it to work they need to maximize their probability of participation. The formula that best fits that is regular servers with simple access control.
---
Keep in mind they didn't even put that wall up for survival....there were plenty of people begging for it.
---
Wild Appalachia was not even real content. It was pre release cut content that they didn’t finish and then did finish after release and put out there as DLC we haven’t got shit besides two maps of nuclear winter
---
If the game can be completely static *and* contained in the game files on everyone's machine, the only thing communicated between connections is simple location information, and there isn't a lot of extraneous data that needs to flow from client back to the server then out to every other client connected, THEN you might be able to have a personal PC host the game.
---
None of that describes 76.
---
Seriously, the Amazon servers that host the game now frequently have trouble with all that information flowing back and forth, there's no way 76 would be playable if it was running on an i5 laptop in some kid's basement on Mom and Dad's DSL line.
---
He means the part below about non cosmetics in the atom shop. It's not a bad thing. It's good they addressed it
---
Wrong. The fridge was specifically mentioned as an atomic shop item in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/av8kp3/a_fridgefreezer_for_our_camp/). The op even stated he wanted them to give him something to spend his atoms on.
---
Demonstrably false.
---
Fallout 76 met its deadline for release date.  Fallout 76 met its deadline for many if not all of its patches.  Fallout 76 met its deadline for the Pre-BETA and BETA sessions.  Nuclear Winter far exceeded its "release" since the BETA was good enough that they kept it around and made adjustments to the live product.
---
Well then my work is done for the day, and I can go back to bed.
---
Hopefully they'll at least be useable by other players like other workbenches. Then you can just add converting ammo to the visits to other players camps.
---
Or... we can get an offline mode with offline characters. Problem solved for at least 75% of the users.
---
Cool so end game quest now is logging in, looking in the atom store, and giving bethesda real money for overpriced pixels. But hey, its a racket we're buying into, so we deserve it.
---
You think you'll be able to control any of that on a private server?  Be prepared to be disappointed.
---
Well if the Atom Shop is anything to go by probably more like $99.99 a month.
---
Given what virtual servers cost these days from Google, MS, and Amazon, it should be more like $0.005 per min of play time and your world detials are saved as part of your profile
---
There will always be complainers its part of life if its not one thing its another. More so now where majority of people feel entitled.
---
Again, its description in the atom shop mentions its a weapon. You can't skin a combat knife to look like the invader.
---
What's the difference if said mods are free or paid, still gamebreaking. Wouldn't free mods in a highly regulated setting be better? 
---
Also should point out this is my first fallout game, but am familiar with Elder scrolls games. Was unaware those mods existed.
---
I noticed mmmurgh will give you alot of the same prefixes at once. If you get a couple of the same perks you dont want try and jump servers before you spend the rest of your script
---
But if they're making tons of money off of it and everyone's buying it that means that the community who plays does want that stuff.
---
I don't agree with them selling utilities in the atom shop and I haven't purchased any of them in response, but hey if people are buying they must want it.
---
Nice!
---
This was a good time to start playing. Enough time to experience the world in its original, lonely state, but late enough into the release that I don't have to wait too long for Wastelanders, either.
---
You both got downvoted Wtf
---
I have a few questions for you.
---
1: How is the game going "Full Pay to Win"
---
2: How are minor conveniences Pay to Win.
---
Do you feel like the servers make a difference?
---
I'm the opposite on the kits. The repair kits are great for power armor and other armor with hard to find parts.
---
&gt; It's not even just a coding/game development thing.
---
Correct.  Hell, I learned about the fallibility of deadlines when delivering pizzas early in my working life.  You can't always be accurate even when the range of possibilities only extend for about two hours.
---
Also you know utility doesn't mean p2w right? It's sad that people think that's what it is. ESO has "companions" that you can call up to access the bank and store from anywhere. These cost $50 dollars. They aren't p2w
---
1000 atoms “we heard you guys like utility items”
---
Well, the Atom shop has already changed the content it can serve so nothing bad in confirming that officially. Now at least they won't be lying anymore when they add something non-cosmetic. It's also good news that they are overhauling challenges. I guess that they would make them more profitable and consistent. So at least when we have non-cosmetics in the store, we'll be able to afford them more via gameplay... Sounds like a good news.
---
Delaying Wastelanders is nothing major. Better take your time, Bethesda. And if possible, make a B.E.T.A of Wastelanders in advance...
---
Some people seem to not understand what kind of private server Bethesda offers. They offer us servers hosted on their side, therefore we pay for that. It's not the same as locally hosted Minecraft server.
---
In total, half of this is understandable, half of this is quite a good news.
---
Its still only single player ill pass. tired of the whole play through once and there really wont be any reason to play again. waste of money for me.
---
You get roughly 28% additional damage from AA legendary prefix against most endgame enemies. It's a bit weird because theway dr works in the game an enemy needs to have high enough armor to gain a benefit.
---
Against low DR enemies there's actually no benefit but endgame enemies always have decent dr so it's always that \~28% or so - a decent boost.  This is true at any amount of DR over a certain threshold without any "diminishing returns" of any kind.
---
Feel free to read up on the formula, it's the same as in fo4 which is explained in 100% detail here:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
50% crit does not have diminishing returns.  This is a myth propagated by people who don't understand how crits work.
---
Crits only take into account base damage so if base damage is 50, you would get 25 bonus damage from the 50% crit damage legendary effect.
---
Where the "diminishing returns" myth comes in is from people looking at their paper damage.  If you have a ton of perks, effects, chems, whatever boosting that base 50 damage weapon to say, 200 per shot, and then you only get 25 bonus crit damage from the  50% crit legendary, crazy theories crop up to explain that.
---
I interpreted that as they will be adding more utility items in the store as those have been doing really well according to them. 
---
They are not complete idiots to add the new gauss weapons or power armor (unless it is just a skin) via the atomic store instead of the actual game.
---
I truly hope that Wastelanders is OUT(er) of this WORLD(s)  
---
i guess until Q1 of 2020 I'll have to do something else
---
You are incorrect. Delay = More time to work on the product = Inherently more polished. 
---
What *would* be correct however, and is the point I believe you are trying to make, is that a delay doesn't inherently mean it will be 100% polished.
---
He said its P2W. I'm not seeing the p2w though.
---
Yea i defenitly have been feeling the same way lately
---
not a problem for me... id much rather have it finished then rushed out the door. take your time. BUT YOU BETTER GET IT RIGHT CUZ IF IT STILL COMES OUT ASS I WILL LOSE MY SHIT!
---
Another thing: according to the last AMA, the PA stealth boy mod is worse than the chameleon mutation and legendary effect.
---
The chameleon mutation has a value of 99
---
The chameleon legendary effect has a value of 20
---
The stealth boy PA mod has a value of 1 (lol)
---
Nobody knows what these values are exactly for, but they obviously have something to do with sneak.
---
Here's my problem with paying for private servers. The public servers suck eggs through a plastic straw. It's slow, laggy, doesn't register hits but worst of all no one does raids and end game content is very laggy. It would be fine if people wanted to pay to play by themselves but no one told me I would have to pay to play without lag. Screw you for thinking its ok to sham people to pay for little to no lag
---
No, anytime you are crouched you don't show on the map.
---
aa = anti armor
---
ffr = faster fire rate
---

The messed up part is that GTAV is the single most successful piece of media ever made seeing that has made billions and billions of dollars.

I can’t find it. I would like to see it though I love building do you have a link to just the video

"Purchasable" private worlds... why not just offline play with a steam-like direct connect?
---
Yes but you would have to pay monthly for that.
---
Yeah we’ll maybe with the 3-5 month extra delay they can add this
---
Outer Worlds, Star Wars, and might try Call of Poopy. If they release around Cyberpunk....well.....good luck with people playing.
---
When you’re talking about something already patched/obviously never played it’s pretty obvious
---
With humans coding the software, it will never be immaculate. I wish they would have and a beta though.
---
Yep. I don't know how or why but I've noticed it with world loots too. I'll often get clusters of the same prefix if I loot several things in a short period of time.
---
So what you’re saying is the people with the money influence Bethesda’s decisions?
---
Yooooooooooooong out
---
What is a private server going to do lmao
---
It should.  And you can invite friends if you want.  Basically , fallout with friends, if you want
---
And here are the other photos they shared:

---
You can play Ark, Conan Exiles and many other games that have public worlds/server offline on your own world too and invite others... There is definitely a way, they just dont want to lose out on the money, but it just means they will lose out on me and my friends.
---
I honestly hoped this would get our group to play again, but it sucks to have to share the world with others i dont know. Thats not fallout for me.
---
I haven't really played in months now. I do log in and grab free Atom Shop Items and I did go gather my Mr. Fuzzy tokens from Camden Park a couple of times for that daily. Been playing other things for the time being. 
---
I was looking forward to the Wastelanders expansion but damn...now I guess I'll play with my dinosaurs in Ark a little longer.
---
Probably why it got delayed till 2020
---
Bloodied (and potentially unarmed) is "hopefully" getting nerfed in wastelanders, sooo...
---
Please refer yourself to eBay if you want to see what pay to win looks like.
---
I hope so honestly. I'd love to see some more people try their hands at PVP. It's a very fun corner of the game, I guess it just sucks to feel like a noob again when you've spent hundreds (thousands?) of hours in the game already. But unless you practice (and die alot) you will always be a noob IMO.
---
Yeah it will, you'll have to invite people. Personally I'm looking forward to being able to have 24 of my friends or playing alone. I have a lot of people who like to event farm with me haha. But when I'm farming materials I just like to chill by myself because I know other people aren't into it
---
I haven't played any of CDs games before but cyberpunk looks like it will be a great game. Definitely checking it out.
---
Exploits. This game from day 1 has been an exploit fest.  Paid mods help this from getting completely out of control. It might not be a popular decision, but it’s necessary.
---
Well like I said if they were free almost every single player would have their own server which kind of defeats the purpose of an online game.
---
RIP fallout 76. What a joke. 
---
I Haven’t played hardly at all in a month because raids are pointless and unrewarding, caps are worthless, getting a marginally better piece of gear isn’t worth pursuing because the trading community has become so greedy and full of scammers, NW is so repetitive (as are all BR’s), and grinding atoms to get one damn piece of furniture or wall paper involves partaking in some of the most monotonous tasks in a video game ever aside from the DMV quest, only to get a mere handful of pennies’ worth of premium currency. 
---
The prospect of playing wastelanders this coming month was the only thing holding my last ounce of interest and hope for this game, and another 2-4 months’ wait will likely have lost me completely.
---
They’ve basically just laid out their long-term business model for this game and confirmed all suspicions: whale-baiting. Actual content will continue to be pushed back, under-delivered, unrewarding, and so buggy it even impacts the base content of the game, all while fresh new skins and utility items pop up for $5-$25 weekly. 
---
The new QoL features (some of which were literally slated for the NW expansion, mind you) such as legendary perks and perk load outs are base-game-at-launch features at best, and have been some of the earliest and most heavily requested features since launch. I don’t recall “I want to spend more money for non-cosmetics” being requested ever. At all. Accessing modded serves? That’ll cost you out of pocket too. 
---
At this point playing Skyrim yet again to get all those features for free is more appealing.
---
Well my build is completely broken lol. I wanted to use PA so I don’t need to use so much damn ballistic fiber
---
Have you ever played in a server with almost no people? There is almost no lag in those servers.
---
You can get an almost empty server, but it requires you to stay in the same server for hours (around 10) until it stops appearing on server searches.
---
The only people who can join are friends.
---
Im on PS4 and hardly ever experience lag. The only laggy element is my melee hits not registering sometimes but that's hardly worth outraging over.
---
2 shot is +25% is added to damage then split into 2 shots or 62.5% each.
---
Wtf are you talking about?
---
I would have been happy to help them with their burden. Those poor people.
---
I was just in your game, I emptied 3 characters of their script in that server, i got a few good ones, namely a bloodied ffr LMG. 
---
Also tse guns are kinda terrible now, two shot is only 30% more damage and it makes them less accurate, even berserkers goes higher than that. Junkies stuff is good, it goes to 50% more damage. Faster fire rate is better than explosive in alot of circumstances as well.
---
The chance of you getting a tse is something rediculous like 1 in 100 million, and there are muuuuch better rolls. The event isnt over youve still got chance for something good.  Ive got scrip for days with all the 3 stars I got.
---
From what I know (which may be absolutely wrong), damage reduction perks and mods work multiplicatively, but I can’t say in which direction they would apply (greatest to least, least to greatest, or most recent application to least recent, etc).
---
Assuming they work greatest to least (which I don’t know if they do) that means you receive damage negation through Protocols first, Dodgy second, and Lone Wanderer last. So, if you receive 100 points of damage from a fully suppressed enemy (Suppressor stacks to 40%), you’ll be hit with 60 points of damage, which is then reduced to 30 by Protocols, which is reduced to 20 by Dodgy, and further reduced to 15 by Lone Wanderer. 
---
My math and methodology feel wrong to me, but somebody here can probably set me straight on this.
---
The big unanswered question is whether you can hop the same character between private and public servers.
---
I'm on PC. FWIW, I run Junkie's and my 1* Junkie's LMG can take out big targets really fast. Like a level 100 Alpha in mere seconds.
---
TSE hasn’t been Meta since last year fam lol.
---
Game pass finally pays off!
---
The picture's filename was named Duchess, who is mentioned in holotapes and notes. She also had a goon named Butch, so my guess is she's the woman, and the ghoul is Butch.
---
Nope, you need to have learned the plan for the Fixer in order for it to drop
---
Which is why I stick with Furious/Explosive weapons.
---
hmm... wounder what helmet that is, on the guy with his back turned... looks good :)
---
Lol. It is a combat knife though... you apply combat knife mods to it. The description says it is a combat knife. Maybe the langue should be reworded but it’s still a combat knife lmao. What is the other “weapon” you are talking about?
---
Converters are probably the worse thing we’ve seen I’ve been wanting a way to break down ammo since day 1 now it seems I’ll never be able to.
---
Hmm I'll have to test that
---
Finally somebody who understands simple facts of real life. You must be a self supporting adult?
---
How did they break the free DLC promise? You usually have to pay for private servers since they have to host the server somewhere. and private servers are not DLC.
---
Wastelanders will likely mark the end of content development, the atom shop will be still be updated though.
---
Anthem says hi
---
Modding won't even be available initially; and when it is, I suspect it will be limited to very specific "Sliders" like:  Legendary spawn rate, delays between events occurring, RAD/Hunger/Food sliders.
---
Its not going to be custom missions, custom items, all the stuff that makes modding TRULY special.  If we ever see that sort of modding capability it won't be for another year at least.  They aren't releasing the server files so more advanced modding is basically out of the question until they create an editor for it.
---
Go to the Posiden workshop, back near the Vertabot you can place around 8-10 Industrial water purifiers.
---
Expecting public servers to actually be worth the money we spent isn't a ridiculous request you filthy thief. To demand we pay to play without lag is like fascist telling you to lick the boot and pay to eat the gum. Go to hell. Im free to make my choice and my freedom bucks is better spent somewhere else.
---
Are you looking for a golf clap, or a tiny violin? My apathy isn't allowing me to decide.
---
Honestly, it sucks either way.
---
Why cant i just host my own privately hosted world and either play alone or directly invite friends?
---
Of course they go for what gives them more cash..... -.-
---
Yeah I work like no lie 60 to 85 hrs in a single week, I've got alot of shit and I know the game well. I want TSE for crowd control and simplicity with enemies, I want it because it's the only thing in the goddamn game I don't have and I have no doubt gotten around a million legendary items so at this point it's for many many reasons
---
A delay doesn't mean they are polishing things that actually need it, its possible and I would even say probable that they are focused on 1 key aspect that they cant get the way they want it and that the rest of the content will still be unpolished. It's even possible that they only delayed it so that it doesn't release at the same time as outworlds and they wont be doing any polishing at all. It isnt "inherently more polished".
---
These look incredible.
---
lol -3 downvotes, thanks for the cool answer tho! I'd like to get technical if you are down for it!
---
now I'd like to confirm that I think with the state of the pvp and absence of permanent player vendors, game lacks continuity for any kind of purchases I might make to grant me a definitive advantage over another player. game has a serious problem with continuity and I admit that bethesda didn't actually add anything that ultimately enables a player to be better than the other with all scrapper/repair items one time use items and even the fridge, which is most debated one(I'm on the fence but leaning close to p2w) , is still up for debate. However, a comm manager just disclosed that they have passed the idea of canned food items to devs (which with the state of daily/weekly challenges is an absolute power creep as many endgame food items have reaaaally fucking op effects but don't see play as they spoil) and devs put up an article with we hear you blah blah; it should be argued that they want to change game mechanics, not make them easier to reach, with paid items after this point.
---
tldr; up until now they added items that fasten stuff up for a brief amount of time, it seems like they are gonna alter game mechanics after this point forward.
---
Let’s reword that for Beth
---
“In an attempt to force the hand of those players truly dedicated to staying on top, we’ve added gameplay affecting items to the Atomic Shop to take advantage of people who desire to be the best”
---
They aren't going to host them for free, and they aren't going to release their server files, as then they're just publicly posting all potential avenues of exploitation.
---
Sad but true.
---
I don’t think being “human” is the important part. I just want the ability to have dialogue and characters that add to the world and story. It’ll be neat to see the actual rebuilding of settlements in Appalachia (which was the purpose of Vault 76 after all).
---
That being said, I think that people are overhyping NPC’s and are probably going to be disappointed. Dialogue options are probably going to be linear like in FO4 so I’m not getting my hopes up. I’m just excited for some new content.
---
sad, minecraft servers are cheap af (the bedrock version)
---
Time will be long. Will sadly move on to something else if event frequency isn't fixed
---
Not really, because it's still very possible to earn atoms in game, and for game changing micro transactions it's better than most other games (personally never brought them but would if a BOS bundle came out)
---
It’s because P2W is so broadly defined that buying a mask on the shop that functions as a gas mask can be considered P2W.  You don’t have to actually be able to ID what was “won” with P2W, it can be something as simple as having 5 more minutes of game time that someone else doesn’t have because they had to find a bench to repair and you didn’t.
---
Except we know this is a "pay for no lag" experience. Public servers suck
---
You just said yourself it is possible they are polishing one aspect.
---
One aspect being more polished is a more polished product.
---
I got Jack and Shit
---
Agreed wholeheartedly. 
---
 I've hated that title screen since they changed it.
---
ghoul slayers gamma gun anyone?
---
I usually use TSE Handmade, or AAE Railway gun and just for fun TSE Flechette Harpoon. All are fun to use and wrecks everything.
---
(For info TSE Flechette Harpoon have same glitch than legacy laser about the Explosive effect. So they do lot of damage and... have infinite ammo... lol )
---
ESO Plus gives you acces to literally hundreds of euros/dollars of content for that price including other advantages like the material bank, all races and class combinations and XP bonus and stuff, renting a private world for the same amount is not even close to being the same value.
---
Dude that's painful. Sorry for your loss
---
Thanks for the reference, I know plenty of people who haven’t seen this already. My hope is that this information becomes more apparent in-game and that our reliance on outside sources is reduced.
---
What new content this fall? What drought in Q1? I think you've mixed up the drought this fall with content rich Q1. There are multiple high quality RPGs coming out in Q1, while there's barely anything left worth noticing this year. Releasing Wastelanders next to Cyberpunk, TLoU2 and other great games scheduled for Q1 2020 will sure go over well...
---
Could being the key word. Most didn’t say even that much. Those who did said they were open to the possibility but didn’t ask for it to be.
---
NA-West
---
Well you could always go make your own game and let people play it for free I suppose
---
While they’re  “ironing out” the Wastelanders they are taking time from that to increase the utility items in the atomic shop, nerf atom challenges and get you to pay I would guess a minimum of $10 a month to pay an online game alone
---
Its not standard, its common but its also common to have locally hosted worlds like in Ark, Conan Exiles, Dont Starve Together and many other survival like coop games.
---
On top of that, if you want modded, you've got to pay (as only the private servers can be modded).
---
Most automatic bloodied rifles will one shot a level 68 super mutant with a sneak headshot (no vats crit needed). At least, I know a  BE combat rifle with powerful auto receiver will.
---
Shenanigans with a posse is great fun, solo is tough. Incredibly grindy though.
---
No one is saying its not a combat knife. But its not a skin. You cant take your legendary combat knife and apply the skin to it, so even if you think the wording is wrong, it isn't, its clearly not a skin.
---
Its simply a weapon with the same stats as the combat knife. Would you be ok with them selling Gatling guns in the atomshop?
---
"Usually a dead quarter" me personally I would t play any of those games except last of us. But for most people Q4 there doing holiday shopping or prepping for holidays or have an increase in work compared to Q1 most people have more time after the new year where life has normality
---
Melee/heavy here. I don't like bloodied, so I'm using Vampire weapons to never die. Perks blocker and weapon perks are must. Reactive plates on Power armor and I'm immortal. With vampire prime plasma + perks I'm hitting 23dmg/sec on Scorbeastqueen. I can switch to vampire melee and solo whitesprings golf building. I have no problem with mobs, never use stimpaks or die
---
 Hi using, I'm Dad!
---
but how will paid mods change how exploitive gameplay can be? because even if BGS has paid mods, free mods will still be developed. Its the regulation of mods and anti-cheat measures that will combat exploits, not just the fact that we now have to pay for mods
---
Ya bloodied is stronger for sure.
---
Not separating survival from adventure was a sure fire way to tank the whole thing (which it did, more or less).  They had talked about seasons when it first came out, which (to me) meant starting over every season with new players/characters or whatever.  Since it was really one a beta test for the whole thing, I assumed they pumped it out &lt;50% done, and just made it the way they did because it was easier, just to test a few things and gauge the reaction.
---
Each server can easily hold 20-30 or more player files, that's not even an issue.  My assumption is that each server is isolated from production, *and isolated from each other*, making management of the player files trivial.  If any player could log into any private server at will, there would need to be a command server, housing the characters, and if they could also access production, that server would have to be housed by Bethesda.  I suggest they'll do the simplest thing and make each rented server completely isolated from each other and from production, with the characters housed within that server.
---
(The server software might still be 'in control' of Bethesda, meaning they'd update and patch them all at the same time, though that's not absolutely necessary in any scenario.  But I believe that is what we'll get nonetheless)
---
whambualnce is inbound.  And if you thought persistent private servers for a game that is built as an always online game were going to be free  you're a rube.
---
Outer worlds out in like 10 days :)
---
Still no difference. All this bitching when every other game does the same thing. You are paying for your server to be maintained and ran. That costs money. So you pay.
---
Because I expect my initial price of entrance to cover all future updates and add on for the game!!
---
Shots fired
---
It is now. I just got around 23 3S weapons.
---
Two more characters to go. Lol
---
Does the skin actually say that?
---
Private servers won't even have modding initially, per the news post.  And mark my words; when they do have modding it will be very basic slider options.  Since they aren't releasing their server files, we aren't going to see the truly interesting mods like custom missions/events, custom items, etc. ANYTIME soon.  If they aren't going to release their server files and are hosting the servers themselves, they're going to have to create an editor program for modders to use and its going to be limited in functionality in order to preserve server stability.
---
We'll see sliders for legendary spawn rates, loot spawn, RAD/Food/Water gain/usage rate, a slider to adjust how fast food rots.  Its going to basically be 7 Days to Dies in game "Modding" options.
---
Fuckin A thats right hahahaha RDR2 coming to PC nvm I'm saved carry on...
---
Glad to help
---
I mean, you'd have to pay to *host* a private server anyway. And we don't know if they're saying "pay a monthly fee for us to host it" or "pay to *unlock* the ability to host it yourself." Since logins have to go through their servers anyway, I'm hoping for the latter.
---
😂
---
Ive got all that outside. Im just trying to place stuff you would normally find in a trailer house.
---
You should be able to build indefinitely if its private... anything else would be shit and definitely not worth paying a cent for it.
---
I've played witcher 2 and 3. Great games. Cyberpunk has a Deus Ex feel. Love that series. So pumped!!!
---
That’s my point. I think the human element is irrelevant. They said dialogue will be more like NV and not like 4, we will see though.
---
If you think the wastelanders being delayed is going to drop the player count wait till you see what private servers are gonna do to make it seem like no one is on.
---
I didn't know the submarine update was out already ha but nice draw man, hope I get half this lucky when I get off work
---
Same.
---
Exactly. Aren't private servers in general a chargeable service for most mmo games? I mean "official" private servers anyways...
---
Nah.  I saw a game play video; my buy in price is $20 or less for a certain epic taking place in outer space.  I'm guessing it'll probably be a year-and-a-half or more before I open my wallet.
---
I am patiently waiting for space, I wish it would come out tomorrow.  Only downfall is that they said it's only 40 hours of gameplay. 
---
I won't be playing 76 for a while except for scrip'n all those legendaries I got today.
---
 There is absolutely nothing left for me to do and I shudder even thinking about making another character.
---
Do you use the armor (vanguard?) that gives up to +35 dr/er based on high health? Or are there others that are better with a junkie build?
---
Wow, Beth really tried to tie a bow around a turd with this announcement.
---
Putting on my tinfoil hat, now I wonder if Bethesda implemented the scorched challenge/Purveyor discount weeks ago just to butter us up  for bad news.  
---
Coincidence that the day the Purveyor discount begins on the same day they drop this 3-5 month Wastelander delay on us??
---
"1st quarter 2020" could possibly be March, over 5 months away.
---
Depends on your goals.  Learning the plan is more of a long term investment - if you get ultra lucky you might get a "god tier" fixer one day and either be set for life if you have a character that can use it, or trade it for another weapon that is ideal for your build.  
---
But the above is a longshot and you are not guaranteed to ever get a god tier fixer.
---
The other benefit to learning the plan is for future alts and/or friends who are new to the game.  Once you know the plan you can craft low level versions of it to hand out to noobs including your own alts.  
---
Selling the plan is a sure thing, you can get a ton of caps and possibly even a decent item in trade if you don't want caps.  But that will be the one and only time you will get any benefit from the plan unless you find a new one.
---
lol can't wait for these "influencers" to chime in like OP
---
my AAE laserrifle is simply called "scribes legacy"
---
A Gatling Gun skin? Yes. You can craft a combat knife day 1 out of the vault. You can’t craft a Gatling gun out of the vault. Hence why the mechanic for getting the skin doesn’t matter for the combat knife...
---
Why does the way you craft it matter? Lol
---
The buzzblade was the best too, I got 180+ dmg. Then came the horrible nerf ruining all fun. BRING BACK BUZZBLADE DAMAGE!!!
---
This is why I want peer to peer servers.
---
Imagine telling someone that their pizza will be delivered in 30 minutes, but it takes 40 minutes because of a car accident that happened directly in front of you. Then when you get to the house the person accuses you of being a LIAR. 
---
I'm sure people do that all the time... but we would consider that to be a pretty unreasonable accusation to make.
---
Goddamn dude, that's better than the BE/FFR versions we've seen
---
What clarification do you need? Bethesda lied and fucked us all over with this.
---
They know exactly what they are doing. They might as well change the name to Fallout: Moby Dick because they just declared open season on whales.
---
It's a public event so there's no reliable way to spawn it...
---
That’s not what they say in their post. They put it like we asked and they’re here to deliver. We’ll already have to take whatever they give us. I’m just not going to have them actually try saying we want it like that
---
Sounds pretty awesome! I hope it goes well. So did you build a CAMP into a fighting pit?
---
yea you have to have learned the fixer plan to get a fixer same thing for the bear arm
---
Right, and will your character ever be able to go back to the Public servers once they have been contaminated by a Private Modded one?
---
If it'll be like that then I'd definitely start a Fallout 76 Roleplay series!
---
They are referring to the default damage increase that STR gives melee users.  Each point of STR gives extra melee damage.  When you use unyielding armor, you can get up to +15STR on top of whatever you have.  My main is a rifle user and when I go unyielding I can do stupid amounts of damage despite not being spec'd for it.
---
You never answered my question. 
---
What is the second weapon you referred to?
---
Also... is the nuke cola backpack a skin based on your definition?
---
psst, he bought the game. He spent 60 or more dollars for what is a 75 % asset flip.
---
It's not pay-to win. Thats the beauty about the lie. They cannot make pay to win or balance affecting things in a game which has no P2P (other then NW). So everything is just utility, or a game feature (behind a paywall), convenience, a time saver. Only optional and mostly cosmetic. And you can always earn it for free. 
---
So no i'am going to vomit because all my lies made me so sick....
---
I'd be glad to pay $10, was expecting $15. Why did people think private servers would be free? It wouldn't make sense to lower the server count so ONE person could live out their fantasies
---
1000 scrip all on 3 star weapons.
---
 Get a few God roles but nothing for my build and nothing I will ever use so they will be scrip'd just like the rest.
---
OOF! *blood splatters cover screen*
---
Yes, that sounds about right.
---
No, not a skin. A weapon with a skin, just like the invader and the machete i dont remember the name.
---
&gt;Hence why the mechanic for getting the skin
---
Again, why not make it skins instead of weapons then? You can argue that they're skins, but you can't apply them to the base weapon, so, its a weapon....
---
Again, would you be ok with a skinned gatling gun on the atom shop? NOT A SKIN, a weapon.
---
Lmao that’s nothing compared to 100 scrip I payed to get a troubleshooter combat knife
---
Or I suppose I could pay $70 for another game that doesnt have more bugs than an ant hill with a cash sink of content (which some being stolen from fallout 4)
---
The lag is almost non-existent in near-empty servers.
---
You can actually get near-empty servers as of now, but you have to stay in the same server for hours (about 10) before the server stops being listed in searches.
---
At that point, only friends can join.
---
Then i better hurry up and feel the powah now! :D
---
Stash isn't a problem as I have mules but the 150 scrip A day is a huge wall. 
---
The only reason I have to play now is to log in and scrip a few weapons A day
---
I guess we will have to wait and see. I can’t see private services impacted the player count that bad on consoles but definitely on pc
---
I think I saw that for about $400 on ebay when I was showing a friend how much some of these holy grail weapons go for.
---
Then maybe don't interpret something that is highly subject to change and dependent on thousands of variables as a promise.
---
I agree. I throw money away on foolishness anyway, if it’s like $10 a month and everything stays I would do it.
---
Right, it's just people being upset things don't go exactly as they imagined.  I'll say what I've always said, the day the game isnt fun, I'll just shrug and move on.  My back catalog gives me nightmares anyway.
---
I don't see how scrapping and repairing is a pay to win deal. Maybe in the beginning it was nigh impossible to keep gear repaired. But now that I have access to BOS camps, keeping stocked on ballistic weave is easy. And it's really easy to scrap/repair anyway. 
---
We do need a hot swap perk, quality of life adjustment to the perk menu. It does get tiring after awhile. 
---
And better organized perk cards, tho I think NOT ranking up the cards, and instead keeping them separated will be much better since 1) you WON'T have to level up just to get a Rank 2 version of a rank 5 card. And 2) with the Hot Swap QoL implementation, it wouldn't matter that there's more cards to sort through.
---
They are actually viable for this game, at least for adventure mode, but I'm pretty sure we won't be able to use our characters in that type of server.
---
You’re only allowed to post so many YouTube links in this sub, 1/10 ratio of posts. So I can’t give you the link. It’s a rule to keep spam away
---
If you scroll to the bottom of the inside the vault post it says “love hotel” and “Brahmn death trap” Those are the links :)
---
&gt; BTW I don't mean to nitpick, but they never promised "cosmetic only" in the Atomic Shop.
---
Nope. We've litigated this one before. They said "cosmetic only" in interviews, and let a vast quantity of reporting (including the NoClip documentary) claiming cosmetic only stand without comment. See my earlier comment for sources: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d2ikst/cosmetic_only_was_never_stated/ezvh60r/?context=3
---
Already said I don't remember the name, but it was there, same as the invader.
---
No, the nuka cola backpack is just a skin you apply to your backpack. Clearly not the same as the invader.
---
Exactly my problem with this. Pay to play with less lag!!!! When the servers should have been a lagless experience with little to no server disconnects
---
Purchase private servers? You can fuck right off.
---
Basically you can't use mods without paying, when I could quite easily host my own fucking server, or you could include single player. Pure greed.
---
Why does it matter how you craft it? It’s still a combat knife at the end of the day lol. 
---
And for a vanilla Gatling gun... wouldn’t really matter but would be dumb considering you need an expensive plan to craft it lol. Unless they give you the plan for free... like they do the combat knife. 
---
What is your take on the backpack skins? You can’t apply to a backpack. are you saying they aren’t skins?
---
Final boss are those ditches while doing scorched Earth. Some fucking Kefka shit right there.
---
with a western outfit on
---
Where does the $10/month figure come from? I hadn't seen any mention of price in any of the updates from BGS...
---
You are mistaken. You cannot apply the nuke cola backpack skin to an existing backpack. You have to craft a nuke cola backpack. This is the same for all of the backpack skins.
---
ESO plus is way worth it. when I got back on a year or 2 later without plus, I had too many items and all because the Plus made it so you had unlimited carry weight for some items.
---
Most people would consider that unreasonable, yes.  When viewed in a detached fashion, anyway.
---
Someone who's determined to be upset is gonna be upset no matter what.  That's why we just hit 'em in the head with a brick and throw them in the creek.  Works out better in the long run.
---
Bethesda: nerfs it in next patch.
---
Yeah I’m really interested in the pricing. 
---
At least things “should” be less laggy.
---
I have turned down plans with people irl to stay home and play fallout with my online friends...don't be too hard on yourself lol
---
Haha I come to Reddit to get away from the drama queens in the Facebook fallout groups. Now THOSE groups are hilarious.
---
Will we be able to use our current characters in private servers or will we have to create a new one?
---
They hadn't said $10. OP is the one who said $10. I said I would be glad to pay $10
---
Can anyone name a game where a private server is free ? I can’t think of any
---
Yeah I was really annoyed by this wording. We wanted fridges. But we didn't want them behind a pay wall.
---
Doesn't matter if you are a developer or not. I've written code as well. If you promise something, you deliver. End of discussion. Otherwise you don't have integrity or a proper moral position. If you can't deliver, that means you lack the experience needed to have made the product in that timeline. Get better.
---
You're a true Todpol Scout.  Always prepared.
---
Na. It will be like the creation club. You'll have to buy each mod separate.
---
Most MMos add new content on a monthly or even weekly basis, not once every 6 months.
---
All of the mentioned can be locally hosted and therefore played without paying... you are making his case for him...
---
It's understandable though. Honestly, the fridge was someone in this subreddits idea too from months back, so really it isn't only Bethesda, it's us asking for all these things.
---
They didn’t say they are nerfing atom challenges. They could be, but they also could be adding more or different ways to earn atoms...
---
How much limb damage do you need, Brother? What are you going to do with that +1 charisma?
---
This is why I love running bloodied builds but refuse to use melee weapons with it. They break immersion too much being able to one hit stuff you should never be able to. With ranged weapons they feel just right with bloodied. Without bloodied they feel really weak like you are chipping away at everything with a bb gun.
---
stop whinging and leave then.
---
You need fixer plan
---
Once every 6 months? In the past month we got two community events....
---
You both probably just had different personal experiences with this, based on games you have played/focused on.
---
I’m guessing all the survival servers were turned into the private ones. 
---
If it’s releasing next week, shouldn’t they be giving us the pricing before hand? 
---
Just a thought.
---
This. And what about world spawns? Do I get a server full of bobble heads, mags and stealth boys all to myself? Can I bring them back to public servers?
---
Man all those down votes and hate that went to those people who predicted non-cosmetics in the atom store and pay private servers would eventually come. I bet a bunch of people feel silly now.
---
/Narrator "Norefillonsleeps observation was incorrect, as this is Reddit, those people will be working hard to prove they are still right."
---
Wastelanders' delay is... disappointing, but hopefully it comes out better for it and there's not just a huge issue keeping it broken or something. And the increase in utility on the atom shop is plain concerning.
---
Yeah private servers aren’t too bad. Conan exiles is great for $9.99. You can make yourself admin, manipulate the game to how you like it (I.e weather, day night cycle, spawn creatures and have any object you like). Do you think Bethesda is going to do that? Nah you will pay at minimum of $9.99 you are limited to 3 nuke launches with a 3 hour cool down for each silo, still the same random rotation of events that you cant force to start and I don’t have faith that any workshops you take and build in will keep progress the next time you log into your private server. Also do you think these private servers can stay up for longer than 4 hours without disconnecting?
---
Characters are absolutely not going to transfer over.  Private servers will be their own clusters of character data.
---
They MIGHT have an option to allow you to copy a character to a private server (if the server allows it), but they will never let you play that version of the character on the live realms.
---
I really hope people don't think you'll be able to hop between public and private servers with the same character like its open battle net.  We all saw how that worked out.
---
Can you scrip at the usual rate and head back?
---
What doesn't sound like you turned out too bad but yeah as you get higher levels hard to find guns and armor that are specifically perfect for your built. On the Vanguard Sentinel build armor wise and those almost never drop. But I have a full set so I guess I can't complain
---
What about local hosted worlds?
---
Thats how all other games do it, either pay for good connection and other people to join or host locally and just have fun alone or with friends for free.
---
It honestly sucks that this wont even be an option and that they go straight for the money again as with the Atom Shop Changes...
---
Parrots like yongyeah will inevitably make a new "Bethesda in complete collapse, mass panic as employees literally jump out of the windows of their corporate office!!!" video to try to monetize this "bad news" no matter what happens.  
---
The Youtube "gaming content" is literally nothing more than hyporbolic horseshit that no one with half a brain listens to any more.  It's the same exact video with just slightly different paragraph structure and a different game in the background.  
---
I tuned out long ago not so much because I disagree with any specific view but just that the videos are boring as fuck.  Well, that and I actually possess critical thinking ability and can make up my own mind about games without someone else spoon feeding me my opinion on everything :P
---
 Well I see your perspective but personally I think we should hold off on judgment of future items until we know more about them. Let's go off of what we have now, if the fridges are closest thing to P2W then we should analyze that further. Does 50% less spoilage really ease progression? That's what the issue is the way I see it.
---
I'll have to look into that then, I'd rather not do a bloodied run if I can effectively avoid it. I hated vampirism in elder scrolls and I just want to play the game as a healthy character
---
My take: it’s gonna be largely the same, acquiring atoms will probably be leagues easier and to balance the game’s economics new items will be more expensive
---
You have to keep the game companies in check and demand they keep their promises otherwise you'll be a fool and be taken advantage of. Which is exactly what this game company is doing to the fallout community. Its not just an isolated broken promise, but a series of fuck ups. Grow up and realize what is at stake here.
---
Nice, submarine!!  Now if any the map had more water.
---
at this point I still like the game despite bugs and what not. I'm more hoping that they impliment wastelanders, fix the major bugs, then move on to other projects. I feel like anything after this will be classic Bethesda practices and by this time next year the game will disgust me.
---
Hopefully your mule is level 50+ or its just a waste.
---
I just wasted my 1,000 script, prepare for nothing but useless heavy weapons
---
What are you even talking about?Meat week?
---
Lol at the amount of people defending the f2p model this game taking on.
---
Apparently thats all Fallout 76 is then right?
---
Wasted all of mine as well
---
Get some poison resist armor. I run 3 pieces of that and can resist her stank pretty well, at least well enough to reposition myself out of the cloud. Regular SB clouds do nothing to me. I do run rank 1 fireproof too, which I seem to recall does something for poison also.
---
People wanted private worlds as in "i invite my friends only or play alone" not "i pay for the privilege of what it should have had from the start...".
---
Local hosts would be possible too, but we cant have no one pay for that right...
---
I suspect its going to be a lot more than $10 depending on the number of people you plan to be able to have on it.
---
nah, your going to get a Hunters rolling pin with limb damage and charisma
---
You make a point. I would gladly make a new character that’s locked to just my server if it meant being allowed to change things like stash size, camp size and what not.
---
Wastelanders better be amazing. I started to replay it because I thought the new dlc was coming out next month.
---
Well you can but Bethesda has screwed us all in the ass and limits us to 150 script per day
---
I hope you're right but i doubt it.
---
At this point i'm just expecting them to be fancy skins for the plasma series of weapons
---
To be fair, why would anyone expect them to not put it in the Atom Shop, based on history and attitude?  I feel people are really doing a surprised Pikachu right now, and it's ridiculous.
---
I haven’t done anything yet except lay the ground work. It was impossible to pull off in public servers. Now that we get private I can have whatever fighters or crowds that want to bet or watch in the server.
---
I thought it was just me... what is up with that?
---
That’s not content? The scorch Beast event isn’t content? You’re an idiot that’s never satisfied obviously
---
That is my dream weapon!! Congrats!
---
Still farming Encryptid to get the plan (I have the base version of The Fixer). Meh.
---
&gt;The chance of you getting a tse is something rediculous like 1 in 100 million 
---
1 in 161 if my math is correct (and if all the effects have an equal chance of dropping, which is questionable).  Very slightly worse since energy weapons can't get them, but it's in that area.
---
I would think you'd have to create a new one, otherwise what's allowed by mods would be *extremely* limited.
---
My guess is some sort of “Quick Launch” nuke you can buy from atom shop. In their minds itll be a QoL tool for those that want to pay to skip key card and silo but obviously others would benefit from the NZ too. I could see it being mostly used for quick camp griefing tho.
---
This.  
---
It doesnt affect the points you can use to slot cards.
---
It does affect what cards you can share.
---
You know damn well a lot of people were playing recently just for this update, and then a lot of people became disappointed when it did not come up so we wasted our time. Not only that, but to release this bad news when the purveyor is having a sale is obviously a PR stunt. The community is mad about all of the things that are happening with this game oh, it's not just one thing.
---
All I buy is scrap kits and repair kits with my free atoms
---
A goal doesn’t equal a deadline. They sought to shoot for November, but that was at E3, and a comment made by a higher-up. Stuff happens, and these months are gonna be used fixing some aspects of the game that would otherwise be a topic for hate
---
Oh right the scrip limit. It would’ve been epic to eliminate that for the sale period.
---
Then. Post. Them.
---
What did you people expect?Money’s the shit the world revolves around,especially these days.Bethesda and Zenimax want constant revenue and both the atomic shop and private servers give that.Giving out free shit helps only with public image,not finance.
---
It’s sad where Fallout is going,but it is as it is.There is nothing we can do to change this.
---
Don't hold your breath about this being free
---
Agreed.
---
Is the 50% sale already started?  I'll make my purchases tonight.
---
Welcome to live service gaming.... while I love this game, and adore being able to play with friends, let's be honest. This game has skins for your power armor that costs as much as full dlc. This entire game, much like Blades, is a cash grab.
---
See you would think they would.
---
&gt; BUT YOU BETTER GET IT RIGHT
---
Narrator: They wouldn't
---
&gt; I haven't bought any repair kits
---
I have with some free atoms.  Beats a 3-hour screws and ballistic run, especially when someone's already been to the two places and it's like ... 69 hours between item respawns.
---
They did remove ~150 atoms. I agree that was a bad move. We don’t know what they are doing. I like to wait and see vs reacting to my own paranoia.
---
You’re assuming they are actually responding to “the community” and not that these were things they planned all along.
---
Ark, Conan Exiles, The Forest, Dont Starve Together, Rust just to name a few of the big surival games that offer local hosted worlds AND paid private servers, its definitely more common than not to have both and not just one...
---
Everyone disliked that*
---
So Amazon's servers suck ass, but your cousin's i5 laptop running the game on his mom's DSL is going to give you a better experience?
---
There will be no modders or community mods. Bethesda will make all the mods and Bethesda will charge for them.
---
I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole on this with you, as there was another LONG thread already discussing it.
---
The part you quoted in your post, even goes against the idea of a promise in the vein that people have taken it:
---
&gt;We just feel that that kind of approach is on the right side of the line where folks go, ‘Yeah, I’m okay with that’. **And where that line is will sometimes move** but generally speaking we feel like we have a pretty good sense
---
I don't see anything directly from Bethesda equating to a promise that all future Atomic Shop will always be cosmetic only.  What Pete said was about what IS, as in the moment that he is talking, not about what WILL BE down the road.  What he said about what will be down the road was more vague and he even says verbatim that the line will sometimes move.
---
I will agree with you on this part, though:
---
&gt;It should have been obvious to them that people believed the microtransactions would be cosmetic only, and they should have taken bigger steps to correct that misconception.
---
People definitely had that impression, and Bethesda definitely did not do enough to dispel it.
---
I did it 4 times today,none..
---
People bitching about paid for private servers.... Surprise. And it's gonna be mostly PC players.... surprise.  
---
PC players are the cheapest people on the planet earth. It's like dropping money on a PC entitles them to as much free shit as possible. 
---
Oh no? You have to pay for a server? Let's call it even for the decade+ of rampant piracy, while the rest of us actually paid for games.
---
"I can host a server for free on mineblahblahblah"
---
How's that going to work for the other 2 of 3 platforms?
---
This is one of those questions that only works in video games but not in the real world without sounding out of place, but what is the best chem to get addicted to and suffer withdrawl effects to get the junkie bonus. I got a Junkie Handmade from a drop a couple of weeks ago, but haven't taken advantage of the junkie perk.
---
Who knows can never finish cause nobody wants to be the damn  pylon.
---
Because they still think its the 00s, when companies couldn't *afford* to host everyone's servers &amp; gave away the server code. Also back when you mostly couldn't buy add-on content; games were buy once and done. Now it's more cost effective to just rent server space &amp; charge the user, while controlling who gets to log in &amp; manage their microtransactions.
---
If nothing else this announcement is going to make the private servers required because half r/fo76 won't be on speaking terms with the other half. Things were getting nasty before, with jokes being cause for massive rate downs, but now? Hooboy.
---
It says they began rethinking the atom shop which lead them to add utility at the communities request(which one of you said that). I think they just plan on adding to the utility list I don’t see weapons or armor being added but I think we’re gonna be getting alot of time savers or quality of life things.
---
I would have gone either way on separating survival. I played it, leveled two toons entirely in it and had a blast until the last day. The fact that they didn't put the wall up supports what you say, they just weren't able to do it yet. Or alternatively, somebody decided it was entirely more effort than it was worth which may still hold true today.
---
It's hard to speculate what their data actually looks like regarding players and items, but one thing is definitely clear, they have some central store that is either used by all servers in real time, or replicated to on the fly, or at a predefined sync interval. Since we know client crashes sometimes result in rollbacks that are often multiples of minutes, I'm guessing things sync at interval. 
---
They already have a master server of some type that directs you to a server with an available slot, and also prevents you from being connected to two servers at the same time. The screenshot they show indicates the private world functionality will be accessed as a game mode, so you will clearly have to be logged in and communicating with the master before you can go anywhere. 
---
We know they are using Amazon for hosting, we know that servers startup and shutdown on the fly as needed. Having personal experience with using Amazon for these types of purposes, it is more economic (from a maintenance POV) to have a single image to start up. That does not make it impossible that they would maintain multiple images, but it just doesn't fit how they are currently operating. I argue that the simplest thing is actually just to spin up a new public server instance using all of their existing technology and set some flags making it private, loading some kind of access control list and calling it good. Much less development time and bug risk than reinventing the wheel. I also argue that they simply have not had enough time to reinvent the wheel, nor is it really their way of doing things. 
---
Ultimately I guess we will all find out in a week from the sound of things. Either way I'm kind of jazzed about it, may even pay for it if it proves to be a more stable and responsive environment for vault raids.
---
 Hi guessing, I'm Dad!
---
Needing to pay to join private servers would basically kill private servers. If you've ever tried to run a Minecraft server or something like that, you know how hard it is getting people to join *at all*, let alone without a monthly paywall. Then again, I wouldn't put it past them to try at this point.
---
LOL. Sure.  In whatever world you live in, shit never happens to throw off a timeline.  OK.
---
Come and work for my company and show us all how it's done.  I get your paycheck any time you miss a due date, though.
---
If you have full control over the servers and can 'do what you want' with them, the answer is no, you won't be able to tke that character off that server.
---
If the servers are identical to BGS servers, and you have very tightly controlled options and very basic mod support, then it might be possible.
---
Disliked what, exactly? Not sure why I'm getting down-voted for sharing information lol.
---
Likely will be part of next week's ITV post, before the patch goes live on Thursday.
---
You do realize that paying for a game....and paying for a server aren't the same thing right? So what does buying a game at release have to do with renting a server?
---
Mods. 
---
It’s a place where you will be able to use game mods and such.
---
Im outright not playing anymore
---
 Hi outright, I'm Dad!
---
Beat me to it 😂
---
[You’re welcome. ](https://nukacrypt.com) 
---
It’s refreshed each week. Never wander the wasteland searching for ghoul officers again.
---
Right on. I guess if I’m sharing cards I’m on a team anyways so I’d only have more charisma so that works out fine. Are there any diseases or other debuffs that take away charisma?
---
Sorry I’m late ! Ima add you now
---
I'm really unsure of what the atom store purchases are used for at all because this game is chocked full of server issues and bugs as it is. 
---
So you pay for the game online. Pay for atoms to buy recycled items from other games, which is used to fund a "free" DLC, so that you can then pay extra to play alone? Honestly at that point they should just make a free offline version that comes with the online version.
---
Yeah, I've been playing since the BETA, absolutely loved this game for like 6 months, and now it's been a while since I've touched the game. Wastelanders would've brought me back, so now I probably won't touch this game until 2020. It sucks but that's just the state of Fallout 76. There just is nothing to do.
---
That's why said almost.
---
If the Private servers have  unlimited access to trigger events and a bigger CAMP budget , then maybe just maybe I would consider paying for it . But waiting for 1 week to trigger 1 project paradise or 1 campfire tales is not an option ....  
---
Private servers should bring harder enemy's to beat . Enemy's should grow with you're level as well. I was running West Tek this afternoon thinking about the epic batles we fought  when we were level 40....  But now ...I tickle them to dead ... 
---
Private servers , total control , more fun
---
Wasn’t expecting private servers to be a paid service.
---
Well well well, i made a post a couple days ago asking for info on wastelanders and private servers, look like my message got heard loud and clear, lol
---
Wait there’s backpacks?
---
Oh you mean like they did for the whole game? It wouldn't be the first time.
---
Absolutely you can. But what's stopping you right now?
---
whats so bad about Fallout 4?
---
There are a lot of games where you can host your own servers for free.  Minecraft, ARK, Conan Exiles, and Space Engineers are the first ones that comes to mind that I have 1st hand experience with.  You can also rent server hardware from other companies to host your own private servers (paying a 3rd party to host it for you rather than paying the game company).  So, anything sold there would indicate you'd also be able to host it for free on your own machine (provided your hardware is up to snuff).  You can see an example of all the games on a hosting site like [this one.](https://www.bluefangsolutions.com/)
---
They absolutely should, you do great work. Always a treat.
---
Guarantee they will require new characters, also Mods definitely won't be the 100% free range do and install whatever you want from previous titles.
---
So how's that supposed to work for the other 2/3s of the platforms 76 is on?
---
Probably, they pretty much said in the article that they dont necessarily have any updates for anything this year besides maybe a few bug fixes an the Halloween event that only last a few short days.
---
for fo76, i'd reluctantly go with no, it doesn't really ease progression, as there's no way for me to profit without being online (thus enabling further spoilage). the mechanic tho is without a doubt p2w, and if the game had an auction system or any other permanent feature where I'd have half the time more to gain a profit, it would be 1000% p2w.
---
canner, ammo converter/scrapper/trader, fusion/plasma core filler etc all provide permanent bonuses and any and al of these innovations fall under p2w I'd say, as they a) create a permanent situation and b)alter the game mechanics and after this ITV article, we are at a point that its only a matter of time before they add stuff like this:(
---
I was hoping we’d back able to transfer our characters over but once we mod we can’t transfer back.
---
Oh, yeah you are right.  I'll probably get 3 of them.
---
I think it just sucks to lose all your stuff. Which is why I suggest that we only drop random loot of an upper echelon.
---
FML
---
I did it with a large group early this morning (before work). Plenty of pylon help. Quick kill of the Imposter Sheepsquatch. No plan for The Fixer, just a one-star pole hook. Ugh.
---
Juice head, that little ugly ass bitch
---
Daaaamn that's nice. I think with the sale going on people should be posting if they're on Bloody servers lol
---
Eh, the post mentions private servers are coming next week.......
---
I’m not jumping on their clickbait bandwagon. Basically if you think anything Bethesda said today was good you have had the wool pulled over your eyes. Private servers are great in most games, but most games allow you to have admin control. I would bet money Bethesda won’t do this. Content is great in most games I don’t mind paying 5-10 dollars for a large content dlc like FO4 Far harbor or workshop dlc, but expect a ammo converting machine for $10 or a pie machine for $7. And if you don’t think “reworking” challenges is nerfing than man you’ve been brain washed. They nerfed them last time they reworked them and changed the reward to stimpacks instead of atoms. Hell they don’t even bother to fix the bugged one. I have la few standard ones I can’t complete because their bugged and usually one of the weeklies is bugged
---
I would have accepted a slight delay but delaying a release till to possible date of 31 April (end of Q1) is not done.
---
You would probably lose your job in any other kind of job sector if you told your boss that your work is delayed with a maximum of almost 6 months.
---
Yeah but they’re a paid attraction I wouldn’t consider it a major feature in a patch lol. That’s like the fridge &amp; collector bot only a selective few are gonna spend money on it so I don’t really factor it
---
Even then who knows what more interesting games will be around when Wastelanders actually launches that arent super outdated..
---
I imagine there'll be a mod for that eventually.
---
Dude finally. They should make The Burrows a ghoul Necropolis.
---
The problem is interpreting something that is highly subject to change and depends on thousands of variables as a promise. Developers don't announce release dates along with the promise that it absolutely will come out on that day and won't ever change. Because it doesn't work that way and it never has. Not just for Bethesda but for any developer.
---
I suspect $15-20
---
It never seems right when someone is willing to pay for something you want, and you won't. 
---
Atom shop users get cosmetics on the regular ... Which helps keep the game going ...
---
Non AS still get free content, plus a fairly fair amount of free stuff in the AS. 
---
How is that not right.?
---
The game files say other wise? :shrug:
---
Math says otherwise. 
---
But whatever, I'm taking a break from the datamining and playing while we wait for Wastelanders
---
Then what happens if the person hosting the private server you switched to decides to stop hosting it?
---
I'm level 134 and 50 and after the Halloween event,  going to try out outer world's. I've been hype about wastelanders and got all leveled up for it, but I guess this gives me time to play modern warfare and outer world's. If there's a Christmas event il be back for that too, but I've been grinding for months and I do love this game but I'm grinding the same thing every single day
---
Having 76's servers hosted by Bethesda is the only way you're going to get private servers.  There was never any real doubt about that, for a whole lot of reasons.
---
Not sure why you thought otherwise, honestly it doesn't make sense any other way (other than some other hosting company controlling the servers, in which case you're just paying someone else the same money)
---
It’s pretty clear to me, no more hiding, full on to qol section in atomic shop we can expect machines to make canned food, ammo converters, probably stash space and more really soon.
---
Wouldn't hold your breath for a reasonable answer
---
Ya I think the RNG isn’t that random and gets “stuck”. A couple of weeks ago 5 out of 6 items (weapons and armor) were trouble shooters. Yesterday I got 2 broadsiders out of 3 picks. Either I’m really “lucky” to get repeat rolls or it’s not that random. 
---
...if only it’d get stuck on AA, FFR, FSS, ...anything usefull really.
---
The community hated it for so hard ...then realized they all were fucking over reacting about p2w and then stopped giving a fuck 30 seconds after the new stuff dropped.
---
I have actually seen people ask for all of these things.  People used to ask for repair kits all the time.  And while no one ever specifically said "scrap kit" I've seen posts asking for a way to send scrap back to your stash without actually going to a box.  The only one I'm not 100% certain on is the scrap collecting robot.  Everything else though I have indeed seen the community ask for.
---
Thats no polishing. I guess they have really big problems getting the instancing technology stable and less broken.
---
Yes added back at the start of the year? Read the Scout poster at a trainstation to kick it off.
---
At this point, it should be readily apparent that complaining about this game does jack squat. We all have our confirmation that the developers are lying flesh puppets, so is there really any point anymore?
---
Correct. I have a character who never did the quest but learned the plan. I have an IE Fixer she gifted me.
---
I’m 0-19...
---
Being lvl 250ish I pretty much have all the God rolled armor and weapons for my build that I can get but there are a couple very specific weapons I'm searching for.
---
I wish Trading was designed a lot better.
---
I could probably trade some of these weapons I got for exactly what I want but I do not trust people so I just don't bother.
---
Ooooohhh. That would be fun. And could be a really good story.
---
Bloodied and unyeilding do well together but you have to sacrifice armor. With the right perks you can increase your armor, energy, and radiation resistance.
---
Also with the build you have to make sure you keep yourself balanced enough to take on large groups. It's a struggle for me at times when I try to take out all the ghouls in Charleston capital.
---
I tend to get all my weapons being bloodied so that I can increase their capabilities but if I raise my health back up, I have the same effects as normal players.
---
Using mutations and studying what effects they have with class freak and strange in numbers can help out for your build. 
---
Good luck and I hope this helps out.
---
Juiceheads a fucking tool.
---
Hopefully Jessica Alba will someday feel about me the same way I feel about her
---
&gt;ded to rethink our approach to the Atomic Shop."
---
amen, thank you!
---
So.. are legendary perks coming this year still ?
---
Thanks I appreciate it! The sub would be covered in “like and subscribe” YouTube links all day if it wasn’t a rule but it is a pain haha :)
---
I more mean that the wallpaper feature seems to have been really nicely developed and yet there are only a couple of wallpapers available. Why not an Arktos one or a Scout one that you can earn in the game? Or like I said a couple you can buy?
---
Well there's the reason they shut down survival servers, so they can charge you to rent one and eventually use mods.
---
Would be a bit unfair to spend time on NW as a developer while the majority of the playerbase that plays adventure mode needs to wait till Q1 for new content. The full team needs to focus on Wastelanders before starting to work on NW again, which is a side game mode.
---
Wastelanders should take all the time it needs, but it's kind of a bummer that we aren't getting new content in so many months. I'm also very worried about what their new approach to the Atomic Shop entails.
---
Because its not the norm to only have paid servers?
---
Most survival games offer local hosts AND paid servers alongside to the official ones.
---
Not really if you are talking about PC, local hosts are common alongside paid private servers for like forever, why are you prentending thats not a fact?
---
Just look at the biggest names of survival games:
---
Dont Starve Together, Ark, The Forest, Minecraft, Conan Exiles and many more...
---
That’s just been delayed by a whole quarter 😂
---
Edit to add: a fridge is just a glorified display case and that took a long time to implement.
---
I’m looking forward to them. I’m a solo player and I look forward to a world all to myself
---
oof sorry man
---
I would be down for this what system will this be on
---
That ... that is a good point. I hadn’t thought about that.
---
Yeah. Hahahahahaha. 
---
"Alright boys, this is our most popular section of the AS. Let's make less of it....."
---
America. It loves capitalism. Until they have to pay for shit
---
Every reaction and paranoia on this sub has been right. The freak out about them adding repair kits would snowball into much more is 100% true. The fear that Wastelanders would be delayed is true. The paranoia that actual content that is dropped is all going to suck like the burrows and honestly Arktos and vault 94 didn’t live up to very good hype
---
Yeah, that's true. I imagine the player count by Wastelanders will be abysmal, and the pessimist in me says that Wastelanders may be Fallout 76's last big update before they drop the game completely, which makes me super sad. Even with all it's issues, playing Fallout 76 in the early days was such an amazing experience for me. For a time, I would've called it my favorite game ever, and these days I can't play it for more than 5 minutes.
---
Thanks man, I wish it didn't piss me off as much as it did
---
Meat week is content. Clean Appalachia  did not in any way alter or add to the game. kill scorchbeasts and scorched? gee why didn't I ever think of doing that before?
---
Also, reported.
---
&gt;You would probably lose your job in any other kind of job sector if you told your boss that your work is delayed with a maximum of almost 6 months.
---
It depends entirely on what caused the delay. And if you've ever worked on a long term project with a team, you'd know that. In fact, if you went to your boss and said that your work was delayed for that long, they certainly wouldn't accuse you of lying about the original deadline, especially without knowing the reason for the delay.
---
I'm pretty sure only the hosts are the only ones who have to pay, not guests.
---
craft them
---
as far as i know there is no spawn for them
---
they might be in ammo boxes or drop from boss enemies but you need to craft them to have a reliable source
---
I saw a vendor that had one for sale 12.5k caps.  No thank you
---
Do I have news for you; private servers cost money for hosting.
---
Didn’t add to the game? It literally added a community event. 
---
Also, again you’re an idiot.
---
It’s the Trump approach. I’m seeing it more and more in different businesses. You basically say something as truth, and you keep saying it, and then people start accepting it because you’ve got no option.
---
Hmmmm......
---
Sales figures vs.......
---
A few hundred regulars on this sub?
---
Yeah I got a really good brodsider but I dont want it and no one is buying it so I think im going to sell it
---
Those games are great and give you full and almost total control of the game through admin panels
---
On a related note, can someone confirm if SPECIAL stats can be reduced below 1 by mutations?  I've done some googling on the topic, but get mixed answers.  I was hoping to find out before risking time and caps on mutation serums.
---
I've been doing that and I'm constantly out of lead and nuclear material
---
I modded you up from -1 because Reddit users have no clue how it's supposed to work. (I'm about to modded down myself). Your answer was excellent and based in real world legislation.
---
Yep running with that for sure. Reduces it to minus 1 which is nice
---
You've also seen .0001 percent of the player base and 0 sales numbers from utility items.
---
When reduction is multiplicative then it doesn’t matter in which order it will be applied.
---
Wouldn't have pre-ordered
---
From what I've seen they go for between 10-12k.
---
Thanks for your answer and effort - i visit nukacrypt once a week at least lol
---
I'm not after the full nuke codes i just want to know whats the matter about the weekly challenge
---
I believe it requires a repurchase. I'm not entirely sure where I saw it, possibly from a twitter reply or a response on reddit, but I'm pretty sure you have to buy it again.
---
i can think of more games that have free server software to host with than games only doing paid servers through the dev
---
Including basically every source game released, ARMA, Minecraft, the list goes on
---
Paid for private servers is not a 'free DLC' because it's not a DLC to begin with.  It's your own hosted server, that if you expect Bethesda to eat the cost of running a server for you for free you're an idiot.
---
“Sales figures” don’t prove that people have been asking for more utility items in the Atom Shop
---
You may be able to just check your stats in your pip boy and see where they’re at. I wouldn’t imagine them going below 1 though
---
I've seen it drop twice in around 65 completions.  I may just have shitty luck, but my squad mate has never had it drop.  Not sure exactly how many completions she's achieved, but it's definitely over 40.
---
I think you underestimate BGS ability with microtransactions. 
---
Go look at Fallout shelter. They likely don't need to pad the numbers.
---
My lever action is named "Ma Bell" (she has the ill communication)
---
My resolute veteran gatling is "Cranky McBoomBoom"
---
Yes, my guess too. They will re-balance the challenges so you need to spend more money, ehm i mean it is more fun to play!
---
yeah its a lot of trouble but there is good guides on youtube regarding leadfarming the bigger problem is nuclear material your best bet is to kill a lot of glowing enemies
---
Anthem is also dead as a doornail...might not want to compare the two haha
---
Early next year is chock full of some amazing ass games in the first quarter. 
---
Ya'll better release this before the likes of Cyberpunk and what not, otherwise nobody will play this update, including myself.
---
It's the rarest reward from the event so ofc it would be easy to get.
---
Ok sweet thx
---
Same here . I work in film so I don’t have time to go out either way. My character is parked at Berkeley station for when we wrap tonight and I’m back at my hotel
---
Meh. An non open world space cowboy "fallout experience"?
---
So far we have no idea how each part will work. Consoles will 100% pay, thats obvious cause consoles even pay fornonline play anyways. Might as well milk it more.
---
Although it could be a possibility, twisting words is what bad media does.
---
This is likely a bug with the engine since it happened in every game since at least Fallout 3. Sadly I don't think this will be fixed unless they use a new engine. :(
---
Every match needs to begin with the story of scoring 4 TDs in one game for Polk High, to inspire the fighters.
---
&gt; Kick in the teeth? So fucking dramatic.
---
Agreed. I'd say it's more like a kick in the head.
---
Just started playing Archeage Unchained because Archeage became P2W in the same slippery slope way.
---
Good thing private servers are becoming a thing, I guess...
---
so there are severs running that i have to pay for extra and not local peer to peer... With outher words, only mods that Bethesda sells you will be useable, because you cant install anythin on there server of course. 
---
Smart move, cashing in completly on the mods, so that people cant have fun and have to pay more. Im out.
---
“Outer Worlds is out this month? Gaaah!! Push to next year!”
---
-Beth
---
That's the beginning of the slippery slope.
---
Depends how you strategize. I use 1-2 pieces of bolstering. If I go full unyielding, I’ll change my cards around.
---
Of course, when we ask for new features, we'd like to have a quest or something to acquire it, rather than "paying" $7 for it. Or give us the basic fridge for free and put a bunch of skins in the shop.
---
Then again, I'm sitting on 2200+ just from challenges so I'm not *too* concerned about it depending on how its all implemented. I play regularly and haven't felt the need to buy the fridge collectron, or any of the kits, so as long as they remain things that I might pick up just for the novelty of having it rather than the necessity, I'm fine with it.
---
Look, i'll give them a chance to host locally before mods, and will make it clear that a having an indirect fee to use mods is an AWFUL move, but they really should have had that option with private servers. 
---
Still this is most likely us paying them to pay Amazon Web Services for a private cloud instance more then a dedicated servers as that's how 76 is set up.
---
 Hi sitting, I'm Dad!
---
Yeah, I enjoyed this game so much I sank over 700 hours into it. But I did so because it was a promised live service game that would continue to grow. The rate which they add stuff an how little it actually brings is honestly such a bore. Also the fact the litterally everything they add is forced into the ATOM shop. Hardly anything has been added to ingame loot tables that isnt from the base game. The DLC has litterally only been a few micro quest lines with little to nothing to gain from them. The only thing that's been keeping me around lately is CAMP building but I'm almost to the point of being exhausted on that as well as everything has increased in price drastically an is only added through the ATOM shop an were missing so many key building pieces like half vertical walls etc..
---
So fucking stupid they even released a BR mode. How many peopel are honestly still playing that shit? How many played it once, because its a fucking gimmick, and never touched it again?
---
So fucking stupid. People still play this game because they want to play fucking FALLOUT. Not fucking Battle Royale, and people who wanted a fuckign FALLOUT game have been shit out of out luck ever since this fucking game released.
---
Hahahaha.
---
Making promises based on other's promises doesn't make you a fool. It makes you a gullible clown. 
---
I've got a car here, my friend promises me it'll bag your friends mad ladies.... Only 5 grand. Let them know.
---
Because distributing server files for games with 0 anti cheat features has always worked out so well in the past. 
---
Of course this is about money, but there is no real long game here. The fact that they mentioned modding just means it came up in a meeting as a talking point and somebody thought it would be good to throw into the announcement to help hype it up a bit. This is about generating revenue RIGHT NOW to continue hosting and developing this game. 
---
I predict right here and now that we see the ability to toggle survival in private worlds long before we see modding.
---
With the delay of Wastelanders, melee still being broken (my main build), and their new mentality on atom shop I’m kind of done.
---
I’ll come back to give Wastelanders a try, but if it’s underwhelming I’ll be gone for good. Funny considering I defended the hell out of this game at launch even though Bethesda screwed my Power Armor edition shipping and it showed up two weeks late
---
I havent played since November of last year mate
---
It's not very good. I got 2 of them but I also did that event a ton of times when it 1st came out.
---
 I was sick of being all 3 pylons so I stopped doing the event.  You'd be amazed how many lazy or bone headed people there are who stand around with their thumb up their ass.
---
Oh, I’m sorry. I misread. It also doesn’t register for me. I have half a dozen in my stash and no complete quest.
---
&gt; those players truly dedicated to staying on top
---
Is there even a top to stay on?
---
So I can use 1 star unyielding with my current build, find egghead mutation, and find somewhere to level?
---
Bring back Harold!
---
1 for 20ish here
---
I have the fridge (both of them) not to use as intended, but for cosmetic reasons (I really love the bloody one, fits in so well).  I even have the collectron, again for cosmetic reasons (mainly because it makes my camp not seem so lonely).  I get the usefulness of the repair kits when fighting the queen, etc.  I don't get the scrap kits. I see so many posts about people fighting their stash limits, and I do as well, so I would think they'd be a waste.  Our stash boxes are too full to send anything back to!!  I have a couple scrap kits that I must have gotten from the Queen, but they're useless to me.  And I can't even drop them for someone that could use them!
---
As long as we get to fight The Grafton Mayor....
---
Backpacks were done the right way. Give us a quest to unlock the basic fridge, and put extra skins on the shop.
---
What system are you on
---
Got a junkies exploding mini gun with 90% weight reduction. Yay. Don’t have a junkie build so in the vendor it goes.
---
Absolutely, the higher your intelligence.... The higher your xp gain. But you need to be at very low health to make sure you get the full +3 from each piece of Unyielding.
---
So its risk = reward.
---
Best thing to do it just run at 20% with nerd rage.
---
And they mentioned that the repair, scrap kits are they're top selling, so obviously no matter what they'll add people will still buy it.
---
What's the principle?
---
You should get everything free?
---
And he's a fool with money for spending 120 bucks on a date night?  Some of us have significant others, and jobs... And aren't recent college graduates leeching their neighborhor's wifi from their parents basement.
---
9.99 a month? A movie ticket is 15. Dinner is 100. Concert 120+. 
---
At 9.99 a month the cost vs hours used is significantly better than alot of shit.
---
Maybe I have
---
u/juicehead2 ass clown
---
What the fuck has he done? Nothing. He’s pretty objective in his videos. You’ve clearly never watched his videos.
---
I guess the bright side is that’s better odds than the BOS Shielded Underarmor Drop from Forbidden Knowledge.
---
Agreed. It's pretty much a 'no shit' the utility Atom Shop items are the most bought. Using this as a rationalization to increase the 'pay for play' platform is disingenuous and going against everything they said they wanted to limit.
---
"Bethesda angers players by-"
---
***DONT YOU DARE FINISH THAT SENTENCE***
---
***DONT DO IT***
---
***IM SICK OF IT***
---
Most likely, since they are going to be dedicated servers.
---
Ghouls never wash their hands
---
With the [increase in non-cosmetic Atomic Shop items they think we want](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more), I wouldn't be too surprised if they go free-to-play when it eventually moves to Steam, like Quake Champions did, or more recently something like Destiny 2.
---
My worry is that after this first year and Wastelanders if it goes FTP, expansions will no longer be free.
---
A shaggin wagon you say..? Ooh
---
Welp, since I'm already done on destiny 2 I'll scour the vendors until I can get a full set.
---
Myself, as a Heavy weapons/Explosive build I prefer the Furious effect. With fast firing weapons you get to the 9 shot=45% damage fast. With furious you don't need addictions or low health to get the extra damage. I had some Anti-Armor weapons but found furious to do more damage overall.  
---
My primary weapons:  
---
[Furious/Explosive/+1Per LMG](https://i.imgur.com/FzEjVWI.png)  
---
[Furious/Explosive Minigun](https://i.imgur.com/6ozcst1.png)  
---
[Furious/Explosive Gatling Gun](https://i.imgur.com/wXCcd7v.png) for conserving ammo  
---
[Troubleshooter/Explosive](https://i.imgur.com/ORm6LCN.png) for killing bots  
---
[2 shot Ultracite Gatling Laser](https://i.imgur.com/tCcNmmI.png) for Queen killing  
---
[2 Shot Gatling Gun](https://i.imgur.com/8gDrZ96.png) For Scorched and Beasts  
---
[Vampires/FFR Gatling Gun](https://i.imgur.com/3AgvYDE.png) For healing in combat (Healing Factor Mutation)  
---
[Quad/Explosive Harpoon Gun](https://i.imgur.com/5653kmI.png) Use it as a quasi sniper rifle  
---
[Furious/FFR Gatling Laser](https://i.imgur.com/VKCATe0.png) for when I have too many fusion cores  
---
[Mutants/FFR/90%weight Gatling Plasma](https://i.imgur.com/UHQEuYE.png) great for making piles of goo  
---
[Furious Flamer](https://i.imgur.com/P7P9I7n.png) bug killer or just messing around  
---
[2 Shot Auto grenage Launcher](https://i.imgur.com/TEJVFIw.png) great for clearing groups  
---
[2 Shot Missile Launcher](https://i.imgur.com/LJ2OSnO.png) Good for anti-air, not so much vs scorch beasts  
---
[2 Shot Fatman](https://i.imgur.com/hpZAw0q.png) When something needs to be dead NOW!  
---
Also carry plenty of Nuka Grenades for that extra boom.
---
Yeah, and how's that gonna work for the other 2/3s of the platforms that play 76?
---
Am I buying a second PS4 and copy of fallout? Leaving it running all day? 
---
Ficking PC players.
---
My predictions are:
---
02Q2020 Wastelanders (because theyre instancing technology is broken),
---
03Q2020 free-to-play (there why the "adapting" the challenges and atom shop because it is more "fun")
---
02Q2021 silently abandoning this broken mess when they have enough analytics for the monetization of Starfield.
---
Still want to play, still not playing until my explosive shotgun does the appropriate amount of damage...
---
Log on every patch to see and every time I shoot the same mirelurk 5000 times to kill it...
---
Nope...
---
But yes, please make the game playable.
---
I'm totally willing to wait for the product I know this game is capable of being.
---
Until then I'm playing literally anything else.
---
&gt; other than some other hosting company controlling the servers, in which case you're just paying someone else the same money
---
I wasn't going to be paying anyone to host it. I have a server capable of running many, many instances on a single box hosted right in my garage and unlike these servers, I'd have direct access to the file system to make mods and changes to data
---
&gt;honestly it doesn't make sense any other way
---
It works great for ARK, Rust, 7DaysToDie, TES3MP and Conan Exiles. Don't see why Bethesda needs to step in and become the Fallout 76 equivalent of Minecraft Realms.
---
 Hi playing, I'm Dad!
---
I've yet to see an item in the atomic shop that doesn't have a better free alternative.
---
I do the Sting and Things daily and in the building where you go to meat the bot (dolly sods?) There is 1 locked door. In there are a few lootable boxes. There's cores in there every 2 to 3 days. I normally vend them around 25c as I don't use them but I get a sort of regular supply from there.
---
🧐🤔😀
---
When you hear the warning about a nuke being launched, get to the center of the red circle as fast as possible. that's win. and paying for it too.
---
Ummm costs me a few bucks to run a Minecraft 2 player server for my kid and I each 6 months.  How do I do the same thing for free?
---
Understood :-)
---
Will be curious to see what it ultimately costs, and how they implement the onboarding of players.
---
Just nip on the FO76 market on here, you'll easily her a get of Unyielding if you're not bothered about the 2nd and 3rd prefixes.
---
Or just go round servers checking vending machines.
---
You can already experience a lot of hints to the next Fallout in the atoms store :-)
---
Ok. So....
---
If you sell cars. And you sell 10 times as many red cars as any other car... how the fuck do you not take that as feedback to offer more red cars.
---
Yeah I dont know if they seriously expect people to stick around with the only end game being 20 boring repeated daily's an the Queen as the only Boss. Its gonna boot a bunch more people from the playerbase an a lot of them probably wont even be willing to come back an try Wastelanders because how past DLC has been.
---
I clearly have watched him. He’ll proceed to state that he states the fact with the information he reports but then have some clickbait ass title slamming some fake news
---
P2w definition is: people crying on the internets for attention.
---
Its easy. They will create some new problems and struggles in game, and then sell you the sollution in the atom store. Not suprising at all, what always suprises me more, is the fact that people just suck it up and defend them for milking there purse.  
---
This is a buy to play game, not a free to play one, and there are still bugs that arent fixed since release. Bugged features for that we payed good money.
---
When I sell software to my customer, and tell them I support them for years to come, free... guess what I have to do? I HAVE TO SUPPORT IT FOR YEARS TO COME, FREE. Or I dont, get sued and loose my job.... but hey, im just a software dev, not game dev. Very different, am I right :)
---
Kind of mean
---
:(
---
All fine lol at least it seems i'm not alone then!
---
Cheers
---
People just want to find something to be outraged about. I heard it's the "in thing" this year.
---
I absolutely agree with that. They should be attainable in game and not just the atom shop.
---
I'm not a developer. I'm the consumer. Im the community that supports the Fallout franchise. You make a suggestion or a vague promise that X product will be out by a certain timeline I expect the company to deliver. I don't expect excuses and I don't expect the community to make excuses. Saying its ok to lie, is wrong. I am the consumer. I purchased atoms. I am not alone with how I feel about that. I know a lot of people inadvertently started playing again, maybe even buying atoms, just to grind for this update. I am not a naive customer either. A lot of people were scammed indirectly. I don't give a flying rats ass if a lot of developers do the same thing. That's not an excuse because a lot of companies don't delay releases. For the last time, I don't need to put my shoes in the shoes of the developer. That's not my job. I'm the consumer. I expect products as promised.
---
I thought legendary characters applied to the whole account so if you have two level 100 characters you would have 4 legendary perks? I might be wrong though.
---
A bit, but it seems like they are really focused on QOL things and still careful nothing is pay to win. I'm also curious about the making things better for other players.
---
Good catch on Duchess! Been ages since I did the quest so completely spaced it, that's the one where someone sent their kid to her to try and get sympathy, and didn't Duchess order the junkie killed in retaliation?
---
Either way, great to see them potentially using some of the pre-established characters, makes the background lore a lot more relevant.
---
It added a counter on the website. They didn't add anything to the actual game.
---
Junkies build just means popping some chems!
---
Nah just the meat hook due to it double dipping perk cards.
---
Bloodied doesn't need a direct nerf as it's a 50% damage increase which is inline with furious, junkies, berserker, and executioners. With anti armor and junkies being better all purpose affixes.
---
Bloodies strength is just that it synergies with adrenal reaction and nerd rage which is great for raw damage but is a liability with stuff like the vault raids.
---
Still a whole lot more stable than FO76 and that's even with my only ever having played ESO on my mom's terrible internet that makes McDonald's wifi look like an upgrade.
---
Set up a camp at a uranium deposit and excavate that for a a while.  I did that for a week and now have like 200 spare in my stash I use solely for plasma cores.  You can get acid to refine it from that workshop by the water park too.
---
Example?
---
In my opinion, I would prefer offline play/self hosted.  In my experience I don't see the benefit of multiplayer except for The queen fight, nuke silo runs, and trading items.  Most days I have little to no interaction with other players.
---
If they are going to over private servers the owners/renters of those servers should be able to change stash size and camp build limits.
---
I know as much as you on that one I'm afraid, I have assumed it's per character.
---
I think this is a really good point. I mean, once you’re past Level 50, you’re mostly just fine tuning your character and collecting more useful perks than the ones you grinded for on your first play through. 
---
The winning for me now involves getting that rare plan I’ve been looking for while grinding the same quests over and over. A repair kit makes that grind minimally easier. And the junk robot doesn’t upset the balance, but his dialogue is a lot more entertaining than the Grafton mayor.
---
It genuinely would not surprise me if this delay really was just to limit the content they have to release before the next generation of consoles hits next year.  I would be amazed if this gets a next gen release and the upcoming transition period seems like a perfect opportunity for Bethesda to pull support for a game that seemingly hasn't even come close to meeting expectations.
---
There are good people who trade. Always use a courier.
---
You have to fill your stash and your inventory until the game will not let you have any more.
---
Delayed wastelanders and paying for upgraded lag experience.
---
I mean I've gotten 2 3* anti armor fixers both explosive 1 90% reduced weight the other the 250 damage ristance while reloading.
---
I'll check this out thx :)
---
I do think that local peer-to-peer mod servers should at least be a free option when mod support comes.
---
Don't be like me: 
---
Learned the plan so I could craft/sell lv 50 versions (before legendaries were added to purveyor). Got a bloodied, less AP cost version the first day they were added to the pool. Didn't fit my build and had zero idea how valuable it would be and sold it in my vending for 2000 (?) caps. Lasted all of one customer.  :(
---
If content delays is making you fear for a game then I wonder what other online games you've played.
---
God forbid you ever step foot into Warframe.
---
Fuck I hope you aren’t a salesman. 
---
You aren’t saying they’re offering more red cars though, are you? You’re saying they’re seeing red cars selling well, so decide to offer different cars?  But also saying they’re seeing red cars sell better than others?
---
Basically, repair kits selling well isn’t an indicator to sell other things. It’s an indicator to sell more repair kits. There’s no other business model where they go “Woah this product is selling really well, it must mean our clients want us to sell other things instead!”
---
Pioneer scouts is content, vault 94 is content. Meat week is not content it’s a limited time repeatable event. That they have already recycled because they don’t have content to release so they please simpletons with an event.
---
Do you like the changes? Confused as to where you are coming from
---
My point is people said “we want a fridge” and technically they got what was asked lol
---
Serious question (because I don't know, not familiar with any of those games at that level)
---
Do any of those games have 'official' company run servers that most of their user base plays on?  Or are they mostly all home server and/or 'hire your own' server based?
---
If you can wait it out I'd recommend starting your new character once they do another double xp weekend. I was able to get my second character to about 53 or so with just a few hours a day during their first one.
---
You need 162 steel to craft the full power armor set.
---
You can get a total of 12 steel a day, 2, 4, 6. From novice, standerd, expert
---
You will only get plans from standerd and expert, there are 3 sets of armor. You have a 33.3% chance when completing a raid to get a plan for each of the sets. So 100% chance when you have no complete plan sets, 66% with 1, 33% with 2
---
To clarify, you will need to acquire the plans for the power armor as well as 162 vault steel (running powersmith)
---
Let me know if you've got any other questions. I am always excited to help out a new potential vault raider
---
I was just gonna say this
---
My point is they're the top comments because most FO76 are defending Bethesda
---
But I just want to be able to launch into a solo world that I can invite my friends to hosted off my internet like Minecraft Bedrock
---
A PA helmet with the [no](https://cdn.imgbin.com/4/9/13/imgbin-stop-sign-no-symbol-warning-sign-red-block-sign-s-no-signage-61hN8JQmx0jX2YptRbU3vFjXx.jpg) symbol would be perfect.
---
The next patch is October 23rd
---
Cant wait
---
It was all right there in today's newsletter. /s
---
Run it on expert, cool off every 20 hours, 5 pieces.
---
There may be an aim-botter here and there but overall NW doesn't have much of a cheater problem.  Now, there are people who have been playing it since it came out who are very good at it, but they're not cheaters.
---
Nuka cola factory and take over a workshop
---
Just oficially delayed to first quarter 2020, maybe February or march
---
I’d recommend hunting for a 2* melee weapon if you plan on spending most your time in PA, since armor effects won’t apply while in PA. As for legendary effects Instigating and Swing Speed/Power Attack are best on 2H weapons. After you get your desired weapon then you can roll for 3* armor since the best effects are the 1st and 3rd star. The sale is coming up soon so good luck and happy spending, happy to hear there’s going to be one less bloody build running around!
---
I made a post a while back about what I perceive to be a bad trend - "Pay for convenience" essentially only works as a monetization technique if a game has some degree of inconvenience baked into it.  
---
You make a game that's fun, then add in some minor annoyance, so you can then sell the solution to this problem that you intentionally put into the game in the first place.  
---
My concern is: what new and "innovative" inconveniences might be added to fo76 moving forward?  How many perfectly good community requests will be released as Atom store only options?
---
I also think it's interesting that they use the term "utility" instead of "convenience".  They understand my concerns above would bring the true nature of these "utility" items into light.  They understand that people would realize intentionally annoying design is the basis for the items they are selling.  So they do a little corporate naming convention switcharoo and call it "utility".  
---
It's really no different from when EA called loot boxes "Surprise mechanics" or whatever horse shit and the legislators laughed them out of the room, calling them out to their faces.
---
Definitively agree that there should be a single player option as a local server, but I doubt they will let us use our characters for that or private servers with different rules.
---
That's not my point though. He's saying it's the principle of paying for private servers as if Bethesda just came up with the idea of leasing server space for profit on their own. Regardless, I play on Xbox, so even if they had a local host server option, it wouldn't impact me anyway.
---
Just officially delayed to first quarter 2020, told ya
---
Todd writes the articles confirmed?
---
I would love an ammo converter. Or just a way to break down ammo myself. I don’t vend and end up just giving ammo I’m not going to use away. If the weight reduction perks worked on stash I would vend excess ammo.
---
Yes the whole wild appalachia was content. Vault 94 is a monument to bethesda's incompetence.
---
not when you're hosting them yourself. I swear, have your kids never hosted a private Ragnarok server?
---
Fake news? Every time he brings up anything that he isn’t 100% sure about he says to take it with a grain of salt. Clickbait? Sure, they are sometimes misleading, but it’s not like his videos are titled like “FALLOUT 76 HAS A DIRTY SECRET (MUST WATCH!)”.
---
Edit: Grammar
---
I'm sure a lot of people bought salvagetron and fridge more for cosmetic/to add interest to their camp rather than utility, so if Beth lumping in those to say 'utility items are popular' doesn't sit right with me.
---
Enlighten me
---
Notice how in conjunction with the private matches, there is the caviat of those who have *purchased* this.
---
**:"Our goal for players that purchase this service."**
---
So basically we will have to pay if we want to play only with our friends.
---
Yeah that sounds like too much of a hassle for my lazy ass.
---
 I don't need the weapons but they would Kind of finish my collection of handmades and lever actions.
---
Spent 900 scrip got crap, turned it back in for another 150, got a 3* bloodied fixer, bit vexed as it had limb damage and crit meter 15%, but you can't always get what you want eh.
---
Ohh, thanks for sharing that. Nice to know.
---
Thanks man
---
OH
---
well I feel foolish
---
For amor the 3*s are often all useful in a way that weapons rarely are. But the real question is, do you have a goal or are you taking a chance? If you have a goal go 2*, more rolls of the dice. If you are just seeing what you can get, gamble big and go 3*!
---
Probably an oversight. It is the reason why legacy energy weapons with the beam splitter mod are insanely powerful.
---
Thanks :)
---
You can literally host a lan game via hamachi or peer to peer.
---
As long as Wastelanders is polished and not full of bugs you can release it in 2021 for all I care :) (please don't)
---
I didn’t even notice that ghoul NPC! Awesome
---
Nice. That's what I am looking for
---
&gt; Really worried about the wording about changing the Atomshop. It should enhance the game not be the basic of it.
---
Since they also mention restructuring how challenges work, I wonder how that'll turn out. Will they cripple them to force people to spend more real money in the Atom Shop, or will they make it easier to get atoms to balance out more utility items in the shop?
---
I've found them before at Sunny Top Ski Base Camp in an ammo crate at the front corner office.
---
It depends if we can move our characters from private to official.
---
If we can hop around, then nah, I dont want any part of it.
---
Lead is really easy to come by if you go to Lucky Hole mine with your excavator PA equipped. Wearing it grants you 4x the amount of lead ore per vein.
---
To build upon your heavy weapons: use all three heavy weapon damage perks, and stabilized (under intelligence). Those 4 perks will boost damage (the 3 heavy weapon perks), give armor penetration, and accuracy boost (stabilized)
---
I also go with either an AA gun or one of the specialized weapons (ie hunters, zealots, etc)
---
My best heavy gun is a hunter’s 50 cal with weightless (I forget the 3rd effect, but it’s vats related). It may not one shot things, but it melts practically everything. ( especially Scorchbeasts)
---
Sign me up. 
---
Only thing that prevented me from some good roleplay in the base game is the lack of folks who wouldn't just laugh it off and the potential of some dick just gibbing me or a troll making a huge interruption.
---
Lucky bastard

I brought my junk boot with atoms i didnt pay for. And i just like having him around chatting to himself. I get rid of the scrap he has cuz its usally shit i dont need and some newbie will pick up the junk for free with probably  some plans and ammo i dont need or cant sell. See thats more pay to win in my books they literally get shit for free that helps them out playing/advancing the game!
---
I think the 76 server software is built to run on Amazon cloud servers?
---
oh shit whoops, lol
---
Same, gave most of my shit legendaries to my pal who got a better luck streak
---
On the other hand, the decent ones I got are a auto grenade launcher, troubleshooter LMG, and a zealot's plasma pistol.
---
Just get a video out before yongyea because you at least play the game.
---
&gt;Saying its ok to lie, is wrong. 
---
But they didn't lie. That's what I'm telling you. Developers don't put out release dates knowing that they can't release it that soon. There's no reason to do that. Unforeseen things happen in game development that cause delays. If you refuse to acknowledge that, it isn't my problem, but it happens anyway. If you don't view that as a valid excuse or don't care about any of that- fine. But I have every right to turn around and say that you're being irrational for accusing someone of lying over something you've openly admitted that  you won't bother to understand.
---
The fact that you're a consumer doesn't mean that every criticism you have is valid. It doesn't mean you're right about everything. It doesn't mean that you're allowed to ignore the realities of the product you're buying and still be taken seriously. You sound like every entitled customer in r/talesfromretail
---
Price it high, I got 15k for an explosive gattling of the Junkie variety in my vendor. Likely could have gotten more....
---
Yeah that statement was total bs. It might as well have said “we promised cosmetic only items for mtxs on a principle of integrity, then we lied, then idiotic people behaved predictably, the reason all games have mtxs and some are truly pay to win (gta Online) these days is bc these same people encouraged EA to do loot boxes and other devs to do similar shady things by paying for them, and so bc people behaved as we knew they would, we will be adding more pay to win mechanics”
---
And let’s not forget that pay to win doesn’t mean “win the game” necessarily it could just as much be paying to avoid intentionally inconvenient or tedious aspects of the game. It’s the same concept as paying to have a PvP advantage, it’s paying to make the game easier/ less tedious, same thing, so the ppl who say the fridge/collection arent pay to win are disingenuous morons. Those things aren’t major advantages, but as we see, bc so many morons bought them, now we can expect even bigger advantages to now become purchasable. Stash limit, durability, weapons, legendary RNG tweaks, all things we could soon be able to buy. Not saying all this will happen, but this is what is now possible because of morons who don’t learn from mistakes of the past.
---
I just want Peer-Peer honestly, I’m not even sure what the point in paid private servers even would be in this game.
---
Oh, put it in for about 3k at the moment.
---
Yeah but a console cant run a local host, most pcs that can handle 76 can easily handle a local host as well, so why force pc players to pay again... its just really scummy.
---
I remember Bethesda saying in the past that private mod servers will not have the issue of cheating or something but i doubt i understood what was being said
---
Part of the problem is that Bethesda was vague about what the game really was going to be, and those perceptions have stuck around. It was talked up the building/survival aspects of it with no human NPCs making a lot of people compare it to 7 Days to Die, Ark, Conan Exiles and the like. Where you were given the world and could play online with friends, or offline by yourself in solo mode.
---
What it really is though is a Mini-MMO. A small group multiplayer online game. It borrows some building and survival elements of course, the ones that were in Fallout 4. But it's multiplayer, quest based system and most importantly, online only.
---
So when people have been hearing 'Private Servers' a lot of the assumption would be that we would be running them from our own computers, not on Betheda's servers. Which obviously if they have thousands of people's custom world out there it's going to cost them money in equipment and upkeep.
---
I know that, but before release they said they'd allow private servers down the line, but not that we'd be renting their servers to do it instead of hosting our own.
---
That's what Ark and Minecraft and plenty of other games allow. Heck, even in GTAV you could start a private lobby.
---
Reddit is less than a percent of the entire player base, you can’t formulate an honest opinion of what people want with such a small sample
---
What is the swimming test?
---
They aren’t working for free dog.
---
I guess so.. seems like something no company can give out for free.. I dont play onlines games beside 76 so i dont know if in fact they do give out free servers to everyplayer who asks
---
Except when the server crashes all that will be reset.
---
Idk what you're on about, but I actually think basically everything they just announced is quite good. Only bad thing is expansion of atomic shop stuff, but anyone paying attention saw that coming imo and hey if its selling well what else would you expect?
---
Thank you for being the first brave soul to post about this.
---
I still believe the “nerf” would never have happened if people didn’t keep posting about how grognak’s axe couldn’t be over-repaired. 
---
When they fixed the axe, they also removed the unintentional damage buff that 200% durability gave in the same update.
---
I’m willing to bet they only noticed this unintended buff when they looked into fixing the axe.
---
Just got my gunslinger to 47 with 6 3 star revolvers in the bank at 50. See you there duelist
---
probably. because the problem aren't Amazon's server, but rather Bethesda's ineptitude at net coding.
---
Consoles cant run local hosts, that doesnt mean you have to be this salty to want PC players to pay too, just because you chose the console as your system.
---
If you are so unhappy with it, why not get a PC and benefit from it?
---
And maybe try a nicer tone, we are not in your home.
---
I got a rock... 👻
---
This 100%
---
Agree completely. I read it as “we stress tested p2w gently, and found that it made us more money than cosmetics alone so we are now going to change our business model away from cosmetics alone.”
---
Some people say that's true, some people say it's true RNG.
---
I was intimidated at doing Bloodied, myself. I have a bloodied and a junky alt, they are fun and take some getting used to. For bloodied character there are perks associated with low health and damage avoidance that make it pretty survivable, with Unyielding armor it is great, but if being &lt;19% isn't you're thing you can even do Bolstering and \~49% health or something similar. As for Junkies, You dont HAVE to take chems, just get 5 addictions, it is kinda reliant on using junkies weapons at that point, but I like to pop Psycho and some ballistic bock on the tougher mobs, this build can do full health Vanguard and some stealth if you want. You can just try it out and if you don't like it, use an addictol, it's really that easy to go back. In fact, if you are on PC I have a Junkies SS super sledge you can have cuz its taking up stash space lol...
---
That being said, My main is just regular Vanguard armor, uses power fist and DCG, hunters explosive handmade for SBs. Nothing crazy and he's a lot of fun. I use 2h as well.
---
For armor it is always best to try for a 3\*, the third star on armor is amazing stuff like cavaliers and sentinels or even sneak bonus if you're doing that. For weapons, I would go for 2\* til you get something decent, then go for the third star stuff. Vanguard is good for melee also a combination of sentinels and cavalier, AP regen is good, but you may want to just go for Strength since you're doing Melee.
---
Can PM me for any questions :)
---
Where is this location?
---
The ~~president~~ **newsletter** and a small group of people know exactly what ~~he~~ **it** meant.
---
Except ARK and Rust servers you could host your own, which is what I used to do since we're only a small group. It's par for the course to allow renting and hosting your own dedicated server..
---
Probably not but peopele with decent PC or ones willing to spend a small amount of cash on a server from a place like nitrado would be just fine.  Just like they are in all the similar games mentioned above.
---
Probs but also likely it was the people protesting about the advanced repair kits being p2w because of the unintended boost 200% gave.
---
Take the boost out and viola no p2w
---
I haven't played in months now except to collect free items on the Store, and it seems like I'll be moving on too. There may be some events and things still left for me to do (like Meat Week) but I don't see myself coming back to the game anytime soon. I just don't feel like grinding for the same things over and over. Wastelanders around the corner was the only thing keeping me around.
---
You mean we have to pay for something that costs them money 😱
---
The issue with explosive weapons (grenade/missile launcher, Fatman) is the 2 shot effect (take the damage, add 25% then split it between 2 projectiles thus 62.5% damage each) is on the projectiles themselves not the explosions they produce. So 2 shot explosive weapons is truly double damage.
---
Giving the server files to the community to run their stuff how they want is also an option. Wouldn't cost bethesda money to hand off the files.
---
They could do both. Have a paid option, or one for people who have the hardware to run it themselves.
---
When it was 75 per 3*, I got a quad broadsider, black powder pistol w/exploding bullets, 2 different handmades w/o exploding bullets, 2 Gauss rifles, tse grenade launcher and the fixer w/o exploding bullets.
---
I am so brave.
---
PS4. Planning on doing it every Friday at 9pm EST.
---
Too bad it was one of the worst INV articles of all time
---
Tbh I don’t have an issue with renting servers, all games charge for maintaining the servers. It’s because it’s “always on” and people with invite keys can play it regardless of the host being online or not. It’s very different from a “invite only session.” Which they probably should have had all along. So I don’t have an issue with renting private servers, but I do have an issue with them not having the option now to play in invite only sessions, which would just “end” once everyone left. 
---
I would also have an issue if with private servers, the players who are offline, their camps don’t exist on the map, that would be pretty dumb imo.
---
So I'd vote for learning the plan the rng might hopefully be in your favor.
---
Oh, Bethesda... You're so full of crap. I highly doubt that the utility section is the "most popular category". Yeah, we may have purchased fridges and Collectrons, but hardly anyone buys your worthless kits. It's so obvious that players mainly purchase cosmetics.
---
Yea i saw that as well im hyped
---
I'm surprised by the little amount of backlash. then again, this sub reads like Todd's hugbox to feel better about his horrible decisions most of the time.
---
people here are *still* holding onto hope that Bethesda isn't a greedy liar, that they won't charge for mods, that they won't turn the shop into p2w, etc.
---
Dont you get 50 scrip for a 3* range? And with the sale its 50scrip to pick a lucky dip on a 3* range weapon?? That was my plan. Just rinse and repeat till i got what i want lol
---
Yeah im not saying "give everyone a free private server using your hardware!"
---
Im saying "Give us the files so we can do it ourselves"
---
Yeah well, just wait until they release the Microwave, we'll see what you think then!
---
So 4-6 more months of the same old same old
---
Doubt I'll be able to hold on that long ... can only run the queen and encrypted so often =(
---
What about the mission?
---
Omg I thought I was the only one
---
[Here you go.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sunnytop_Ski_Lanes_base_lodge) I never can remember the exact name of that place. It's down the hill from the Sunny Top Ski Lanes.
---
Cool. It would be interesting to find out that some of the people we've been following though holotapes managed to flee Appalachia. And would make sense that they would return once the scorchbeast threat had been dealt with. I could see some interested friction over who controls this area with one side going 'This was our home, we held it while you hid in that vault' vs 'The only reason you can be here is we dealt with the Scorched. You abandoned Appalachia, we recovered it.'
---
Yeah also missing the holiday sales, not good, this is supposed to be like a re launch, and missing the potential holiday sales can’t be good for maximizing players coming back or new ones buying the game.
---
Not if they give us the files to run a server ourselves. Like so many other games do.
---
Why the fuck should they just hand over their server titles because you feel some sort of misguided entitlement to them...
---
I hate the spread/accuracy penalty from 2 shot on most weapons.  
---
Also I have a Quad/Explosive Harpoon gun so yeah I know.
---
Ohhh i see. But wouldnt that be a bad business move? Good move for the fan base and keeping a percentage happy but bad for profit and stock and what not?
---
you mean there's a monthly fee to operate my own computer? I must be behind several years!
---
Well played!!
---
Full lead lines armor and lead lined back pack :)
---
Whats ditw?
---
I share your concerns equally. I’m not a reactionary person, I accept that there are many gray areas and generally don’t buy into slippery slope arguments. Which is why I hope they’ll tell us exactly what they’re planning. 
---
This game wouldn’t even have a prayer for a second chance if it weren’t for this community. As such, we deserve better. Clarity and transparency aren’t too much to ask at this point and frankly, that’s in Bethesda’s best interest too.
---
Exactly, I’ve always ignored most of the rumours.. but I’ve also noticed irregularities in regards to some of my hauls from certain servers.. now seems like the best time to try and talk about it! Would much rather hunt all weekend for one of these servers, that get 40 beserkers black power pistols 😂🤷‍♂️
---
Winning
---
No worries March is right around the corner. I’m sure the player base won’t take any hits when all we have left to do is kill the queen
---
And 25 rad ris legendary effect on every piece
---
It's prolly heavier as you have so much more of it then purified so it's a placebo effect, however it does indeed weigh much less
---
They can still charge the console players. And offer a paid version for those who dont have the hardware or know how to run it themselves.
---
I think you will be surprised at how many people will pay for a single player Fallout or one that they can control themselves. Especially considering how the franchise has in the past been exclusively single-player. That being said I have no interest except the opportunity that comes with mods.
---
Imagine something being called perfect on initial release with FO76 branded to it lmao
---
Its a good move for the community. Do something to keep the playerbase happy.
---
People are already buying Strangler Heart power armor and legacy explosive weapons. Why not let Bethesda get in on the action?
---
I don’t get all the hate directed towards you. Plenty of way better games allow you to run true private servers instead of this BS and they are doing just fine without charging you.
---
because that's how lots of games operate? because that's the only way to truly mod the game, like it's been almost a tradition with past Bethesda titles? because it's what lots of people wanted from the very beginning?
---
I never wanted to be tethered to Bethesda's services.
---
The challenge is bugged. Seems like it was bugged when it came up in August too from what I've seen.
---
does it really matter? dont we all just click through it pretty quick to, you know, play the game?
---
I get your point. I figured they meant dedicated private servers instead of peer to peer, mostly due to the implied lack of mod support.  If it's peer-to-peer, it's likely at least the host would be paying, so. I dunno. Guess we'll see.
---
YouTubers weren't who I was referencing there. I meant the users on this subreddit who have alt accounts to parrot their opinions and bombard the sub with almost sheep-like same posts to make it seem as if this is the general population's opinion.
---
 I'll put a list of the announcements and what I think of them and you can skip them if you want.
---
1. Wastelanders being delayed - bad thing, tbh. It's gonna be buggy regardless, them putting it off means something was probably *really* broken. Like NV at release levels of broken, still playable but not good.
---
2. Private servers and costing money - pretty expected. A lot of people figured private servers would cost money, because why would Bethesda cut off more servers to let a single player play by themselves?
---
3. Non-cosmetics in the atom shop - good that they finally addressed this and set it straight. There's nothing wrong with having utility items in the store. It's when you're getting gear upgrades or increased buffs that makes it a bad thing. People already complain about the current atom challenges regularly, so it's good that they're changing the way they're given
---
Yep like there is a hive mind out there or something
---
WELL I WANNA KNOW CAUSE I MUSTVE BEEN ON THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF A GOD SERVER
---
Too many good games coming out- this will die out by the end of next year
---
The problem with anti-armor on explosive weapons (grenade/missile launcher, fatman) is the effect is on the projectile not the resulting explosion, tho explosions have their own armor penetrating effect.
---
Yup.
---
it is. same as keeping the atom shop cosmetic only. you have to pick your sides, I guess.
---
Gee leave the guy alone, why all the hate?
---
You should give away stuff for free at the place you work. Practice what you preach.
---
Exactly. If bethesda truly runs things, we'll never have true modding freedom. There will always be the chance someone runs a mod bethesda doesnt like, and they either take it down, or change something behind the scenes so it doesnt work. Without direct access, we'll never have full modding capability like the various script extender mods well known throughout bethesda games.
---
&gt;lets be real the community hated utility items being added to Atom Shop 
---
Except for, you know, everyone actually bought those items, so, I'm just guessing here, a very vocal minority of the community hated it. If you visit 3 camps at LEAST 2 of them will have the bot and/fridge and most have both. 
---
In the end, what does it matter to you? If people want to pay and/or grind for it, that's their business not yours. If on the other hand you don't like it because you think it encourages more then I suggest you realize that is how the real world works. Business are there to make money...in return, the business creates demand for something somebody wants to buy ..
---
Games with dedicated private servers cost money. This has always been. It’s how gta and Minecraft have always been. The host establishes a server and decides the rules. Why is this upsetting people? It has worked beautifully for many game before. Once mods become more prevalent; there will be some incredible servers.
---
This is what I and many others have been asking for ever since the fridge and collectron came out, but does Bethesda listen? No. And then they wonder why I haven't spent any money in the Atom Shop in a while. Clearly all I am to them is a walking wallet and for the amount of money I've spent in the Atom Shop already, the least they could do is make the game noticeably more stable.
---
Happy to pay for a private server so long as prices are reasonable. No need to patch it myself, no additional chunk of PC resources to run it, and no security threats from having outside clients connecting on my end.
---
I dont know.
---
I can't name a single game out there that has maintained a persistent player state in company run public servers that has ever distributed their server binary to the public. The greatest length any company has gone is distributing to datacenters and game server providers who in turn charge for "private hosting". 
---
The reason why is simple, distributing the sever binary is like handing the keys over to any programmer remotely interested in spending their tinker time disassembling the binary looking for exploits. Yes we already have the client, yes people are constantly digging into it looking for flaws, but having the server makes it that much easier.
---
They learned their lesson from the rushed launch of fo76.  Better to get the most polished product humanly possible out there then to rush yet ANOTHER release with the mindset of "fuck it we can fix it later".  That strategy bit them in the ass and they lost a LOT of brand value as a result.  
---
They didn't want to delay it but they realized it wasn't ready and a broken release would probably sink the game permanently.  
---
Better to roll the dice and hope players come back en masse if Wastelanders knocks it out of the park.
---
I think it should only appear after you complete the quest. Like you cleared the way for them. Or, if there is a time shift with Wastelanders it could be assumed  completed? Either way the quest wouldn't be much if a loss.
---
good thing for hotel WIFI!
---
No, but it's not 'par for the course' to only have rental services. They may be out there, but can't really recall any where we were forced to rent a server if we wanted to play privately.
---
Yeah, not looking too good now, eh?
---
Sweet! Why dony you just keep doing it till you get a fixer? Wish i had the plan i would give up my 1000scrip for the plan alone haha
---
That's ridiculous. Delaying Wastelanders is one of the best 76 news I've heard in a while. Like most players, this overhall (which is what it really is, more than just an update) has me excited, but not if its broken. The problem here is simple, the instancing tech is not working right yet. We see that with the Vault raids. I've been getting more and more nervous about how badly Wastelanders could break the entire game the more I hear about the Vault raids (I've avoided them for this very reason).  
---
They need to fix the instancing first since Wastelanders is going to rely so heavily upon it. From what I understand, Wastelanders is going to be built on that tech and with it not really working yet it could be disastrous. Really, this shows me that they know they aren't "there yet" and they know what is the most broke. Their response to "fan-demand" is highly suspect, since its based more on numbers than what people are actually saying. But as far as knowing what they need to fix before Wastelanders, it seems like they are fully aware and working on it.
---
It sets the mood. It also shows that the developer cares if the title screen matches the game.
---
I don't.
---
I would suggest Scrounger perk and looking at every ammo box you find.
---
&gt; There was never any real doubt about that, for a whole lot of reasons.
---
The top of the list is cheaters, primarily dupers. Why the hell should bethesda just hand over their server files to these people?
---
Companies let players host dedicated servers on their own all the time. Its incredibly common, and a big factor for community support. Letting people run the game their way.
---
They can still offer paid options for those who do not have the hardware or knowhow to do it themselves.
---
I am okay with the delay. I would rather them delay the content then release it in an unfinished state with glitches galore. Am I disappointed? Absolutely, am I going to quit playing? No, I find satisfaction in being a weapons dealer and trader and obtaining rare items more than playing quests. Of course sometimes I do quest runs and yeah, I wish we had more content. But honestly, I still enjoy the game and will wait patiently. Hopefully they will continue to add new temporary events like the Halloween stuff and the Clean Appalachia community events. If what they release is still full of bugs and unfinished? Then ill reassess my position on the game
---
I’m going to try again later. Maybe have better luck, and when my script counts resets. 
---
That’s a lot of weight to be carrying.
---
Makes sense. I suspect sneak attacks, critical hits and limb multipliers do nothing for the explosion effect too.
---
&gt;so they can make more money
---
Well, yes, that is what businesses do, they try to make money...if they dont make money the don't stay in business or, at the very least,  cut their losses. They are not a welfare program they are a business
---
It also isn't going to be a case of "mod the server with whatever mods you want that do whatever you want" either, for in my opinion obvious reasons, but that will be the next great outrage for this dumbass subreddit
---
yeah, but Bethesda should do the right thing here and give a vocal minority what they want. /s
---
Far Harbor was $25 when it launched and you can earn Atoms in game for free.
---
title song should be, "Country Roads, Take me Home" and then just a bunch of random panning camera shots of different structures/buildings around Appalachia. No need to compose a new 'dramatic' song when you already have the rights to a bunch of awesome songs in the game.
---
Yah not everyone is on PC many are on console and for countless reasons it isn't a good idea first of all m o n e y yes companies need to make a p r o f I t. And pirating is another.
---
Ive done countless runs of fo3, nv and fo4, never seen it outside of 76 O.o
---
You're a little misinformed. Minecraft can be run for free, by anyone if they know what they're doing. You dont need to pay for a server.
---
So many games are that way. And "its worked beautifully for many games' also apply to all the games that hand people the server files. Literally every valve game for example.
---
I’m hoping that’s not the case and hoping that they explain what exactly their plans are. Items with some novel utility aren’t necessarily bad in my opinion. Items that only exist to solve an intentionally implemented inconvenient mechanic are. What’s it going to be? 
---
This community has supported this game and defended Bethesda at every turn. It deserves a clear and transparent explanation at the very least.
---
Yeah more like March now
---
She gave me this [Harpoon Gun](https://i.imgur.com/5653kmI.png) last week. Wonder what I'll get this week?
---
Exploits. Look at the mods on FO4. Build your own legendaries, cheat rooms. It would not be good.
---
You give me hope
---
I can tell you the environment was not an asset flip.
---
Yeaaaaah. One of the reasons i purchased 76 in the first place was the promise of private moddable worlds. They cant even properly deliver on this.
---
I liked the Wild Appalachia one the best. Or maybe they could make them randomized? They do it on ESO I think
---
And then they fix the exploits. Its like saying "Dont let people play the game, or they'll figure out how to cheat"
---
1. I actually reallllly disagree. Will it be buggy on release..probably it still is BGS and Fallout 76 and their track record doesn't make me think otherwise. BUT I think the delay greatly increases the likelyhood we see less bugs and all around more polish. Imo this is their shot at winning back a big chunk of the users and getting it right is essential 
---
2. Totally agree, I am genuinely shocked people thought otherwise.
---
3. I don't like it personally, but: they sell well, don't get much push back, and are relatively easy to produce - not shocking we see more. I think the part of the ITV on this basically said we will see more of it in the future, which is not surprising in the slightest. I found it odd how they said people are happy about it and its a response to feedback. I haven't seen anyone praising the utility items. I've seen tolerance, but not praise and I am not sure where they got that from 
---
All around I think we mostly agree
---
Rough news for 76, but honestly not surprising. It’s really tough because I liked the game and thought it had potential. It did have potential, but now I hope it fails so miserably that they don’t try to pull this shit with the next elder scrolls or star field. It’s so sad to see one of your favorite developers go so far downhill that you lose all faith in them.
---
Cheers!
---
Hmmm Bethesda should probably think about that lol
---
I doubt the Purveyor is affected by the server. However, I’m almost certain that some servers have more/better legendary spawns then others. Have spent hours farming locations on one server getting few mediocre legendaries to switching servers and getting more frequent and better legendaries from the same locations (West Tech, Uranium Fever, etc.). Stopped farming for scrip this way because of it so I don’t know if it’s changed since.
---
5k scrip. 3 fixers 3*s, 1 bloodied, 1 medic, 1 furious. Whoot whoot. (So many other goodies. I think 3 vamp miniguns...)
---
They should do the right thing for the lifespan of the game and do the thing that will make the most people happy.
---
I got a 3\* crossbow, yay (sarcasm).
---
Except it's not. Off the top of my head I can think of more games that \*do\* allow self hosting for free than don't and many of the don't are EA titles (battlefield and battlefront)
---
Either way it introduced a huge new map, more creatures, more weapons and armor, tons more quest and workshop items. I paid $18 for the liberty prime skin and I can’t even make it shut up
---
Events are definitely the spice of fo76. Look at Guild Wars 2. Nothing has come close to the scale of their events (that I know of). Even just changing the seasons would be amazing and amount to little more than a set of four texture packs for terrain.
---
They're more than likely going to keep player saves for modded worlds tied to those modded worlds.
---
Dataminers confirmed that not every server is equal. They're just not sure when the seed happens. They say they couldn't come to a consensus but it's done when you log on. They still don't know everything and are gonna keep trying to shine some light on it
---
It’s pay to have fun now
---
dead in the water, one of the v94 raids
---
I’ve ran 3 dedicated servers in Minecraft and each one had a monthly fee. Please tell me what I did wrong. Like legit tell me how to have a free dedicated server. I would like that.
---
I mean engines can be updated and changes made even after a game is released. With each patch the engine likely evoles in some way.
---
then console players don't get that option. this is nothing new, they've always been limited in options.
---
piracy also didn't make Skyrim or Fo4 always online.
---
and it's obvious greed is the biggest factor in play here. but I guess it'll only bother you when they go full p2w with the atom shop.
---
According to someone from the last AMA, legendary drops follow a seed.
---
They also emphasized that RNGs in general are never truly random.
---
&gt; since nowadays the legendary enemy spawns are slowly getting worse and worse.
---
I've run into nearly 10 high level legendaries and a handful of low level ones in the last 24 hours. They've been spawning in pairs for me for the most part. I was wandering if the spawn rate for legendaries got kicked up a bit recently.
---
&gt;Now they officially confirmed that they re-evaluated that. 
---
Well, yeah, they said that back in late winter/early spring. In the end, the game makes money or it goes away. I'd rather have a choice on what I spend it on over a subscription service. They are a business not a government welfare program after all
---
I have over 600 scrip and I thought that was a lot. Wow
---
You see I bring this up because during the last sale, on one server where I spent I think atleast 700 scrip, I got multiple pistols with the explosive legendary prefix, and the main prefix would usually be berserker or Junkies!
---
Sets the mood lol - Usually before i play i light some candles, play some kenny g and slip into something more comfortable
---
brown chick brown cow!
---
Yes! Exactly!
---
No, you get 40 script.
---
I only have the fixer plans on 1 of my characters (I play 2, might make a 3rd if i feel cute)   
---
I got two fixers last sale, one was so terrible but the other one became my new favorite weapon and I changed to a commando sneak build and love it. Its 3\* Explosive vampires 90% weight. Sure there are better ones but this one is mine.  
---
My other character without the fixer plans needs a nice 3\* heavy weapon so maybe the lack of plans will make the drop chances of everything else go up a fraction.
---
The repair kits have been nice if low on resources after making a lot of ammo.
---
I’ve only used scrap kits twice: both times after fighting the queen, and wanting to store junk before looking for flux/material.
---
Note: repair kits have been queen drops, and scrap kits were included in a bundle I bought to get a PA skin. I have not purchased either as stand alone items for atoms.
---
Im own alot of pipe rifles and revolvers. I get alot of those from the vendor. So this holds some merit.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Oh yeah sure.
---
You need hardware to run the server off of. Your computer can work just fine. You just need to download the server files and set it up to run off your computer somewhere.
---
Spigot is a popular choice. There are many guides to run it off your own hardware. Its quite easy.
---
Or maybe the quest turns into an event every week? And ret of time its like a *settlement*
---
Sorry for using the *"S"* word i know this is a safe space free of preston and Mayer OG
---
Same here. I’ve leveled up three different characters across two different systems. I’ve paid for this game three times. Twice for myself, one on XBone and another on PS4 so I could play with my friend. I bought him a copy and he was immediately not impressed and doesn’t even play with me so that money was wasted. Then there’s the constant slew of ridiculous bugs that any other studio would be embarrassed of but Bethesda shrugs off to focus pumping out over priced Atom store items. They stole our fridge idea and charged us $7 for it, and now it looks like that formula is getting ramped up. 
---
I am so disappointed
---
I don’t think I can cope with another 4 months of that disgusting theme music
---
I would not put money that Bethesda would allow for admin control over your paid server
---
Wastelanders is sooo much more work than dropping a new NW though so it's not comparable. Adventure as of right now still has a lot more content than NW as well so there's that.
---
It would be more unrealistic if no other game did it just fine on the games launch. A triple A company like Bethesda should be able to manage player-run servers and barring them behind another paywall is another scummy way to pocket some money from us. If this was an optional thing and you could host your own it would be very different.
---
Oh damn you Bethesda. The game has been out over a year and imo its still in Beta phase. Content is not enough. Added content is not even working most of the times. I spend more than the price of a normal game for this and the only thing you do is delaying or spending more time on Itom Shop.
---
I was one of those that stood by but nowadays the game is beyond saving for end game players. Sometimes I log in, spend 5 mins on loading screens and potential crashes/reboots to get in game, see that nothing is fixed or added and to log off after doing jack all for 20mins.
---
" Oh wait for the DLC in fall 19, it will be epic! " I heard these exclamations just too much in the last year. Vaults? UNPLAYABLE. Project Paradise? UNPLAYABLE. Etc..
---
I did most of the tadpole and whats it called challenges that made most of us get never seen before inner rages ... for a FALLOUT game! You lost me. 
---
As a very brief ESO player ( played it before FO76 to get to know what a MMO is as a die hard ES and Fallout fan) I could tell FO76 should just copy paste 3/4 of their quest and party structure. Sigh.
---
So do I need to scrip anything or just have my 10 handmades in my inventory only??
---
Hmmm.  So I need to put my tse gatling and tse handmade in my inventory and remove all else.
---
Except console doesn't have the hardware. They probably want to keep it equal so their console players don't whine. I mean, I'm a console player and I would whine
---
They're hinting at that in the latest blog post anyways.
---
What are some of the mods we can expect and roughly how long after patch 14 will we get mods? I would like to know so I can make my decision on buying a server right away or wait a month.
---
Nice! I've had my BE lmg forever. Yeah it burns through ammo but it does a nice job.
---
I don't remember that, but I have a new character that I can redo the quest with.
---
Yeah the Fallout 76 lore is really good. You have to explore and look for it, which makes it even better.
---
Will private servers have an admin panel?
---
Plenty of other games that hand over the software to the userbase dont give consoles the choice. Its a limitation of playing on console.
---
You're going to prime it, too, right? It's going to be awesome at mowing down mobs.
---
They could always try something that ARK does, which is they have the official servers, private servers that players can play on by themselves or they can host for free with their friends, or they pay to RUN a modded server through Nitrado. But honestly, I'm not even worried about it. If I wanted to play Fallout alone, I'd go play 4 or 3 or NV
---
Not likely, will be live servers hosted @ Bethesda
---
Amen
---
What does the Wasterlanders delay mean for the road map in 2020, if there is one?
---
I guess this is good as I got back into the game, just beat Final Departure, so still lots to do.
---
Will look into what is positive about private servers. I rarely interact with other players anyways.
---
Yea but... why did you pay $18 for a skin? You can get Atoms for free in game. I get that it's a grind, but if paying real money for this shit is so frustrating then don't do it. There literally are other options.
---
I got a bloodied explosive +1 perception minigun... out of 1,000 scrip
---
i add in what i want and remove what i dont want, then attempt the scrip
---
to be extra sure, you could try doing as i say, but before scripping, server hop so the game locks in your inventory image, then redo the whole process on the new server of adding in stuff just to be sure
---
i say this because im not entirely sure how and when the game acknowledges your inventory changes
---
More options is always good.
---
Maybe they'll make it "Wastelanders is Coming!" and then we can see how long it stays up :O
---
I was excited untill I realized that they wanted to charge for it. That is inexcusable bullshit. GIVE ME A FREE PRIVATE SERVER YOU GREEDY ASSHOLES.
---
ouch that sucks, i'ts a longshot but maybe you can ping Bethesda support for help?  Doesn't hurt to ask and the worst case scenario is they can't help but if they can restore your main that would be great.
---
Things like that make me hopeful we're going to get an awesome experience. Fallout 76 is incredible and Bethesda NPCs are some of my favorites. It will be worth the wait!
---
lol okay, they already get flak for their single player games not being moddable on console. I think it's a good thing. Maybe pay to private is a limitation of not having disposable income
---
I really hope it burns the franchise big time, so maybe they will learn before they crash elder scrolls too.
---
&gt;Yeah but nobody wanted them to be exclusive to the atom shop
---
So...what you're saying is that you feel entitled to get a fridge? You're certainly able to grind out the 800 atoms, it doesn't really take that long...or if you must have it now pay for it.simple
---
I would suggest starting all 3 questlines - mysteries, recruitment blues, and excavator.
---
You can also start on Roses quest, but that one will quickly take you to areas you are not quite ready for.
---
Once you srart mysteries and roses quests then get the return to ... task, suggest you don't go back to the  until after you make L50 - the reward will be much better.
---
That does indeed suck. Will you be doing the same build again now?
---
Shroud of the Vault Dweller
---
fellow battlefielder here and yes, thats how private servers work.  i just wonder if they've got the tech for an actual server browser
---
Hopefully. We will see if it turns into another survival death bed.
---
It's not the first time they've had that challege and it didn't work before either. It's very irritating when you report it to them and they put it back up anyway.😒
---
**" We heard from many of you who wanted items with some real utility. Starting in April, we began adding items such as Repair Kits, Scrap Kits, the Collectron Station, and a working Refrigerator. "**
---
Who? I've only seen apologists say this when everyone was pissed off when it happened.
---
**" we are delaying its release to Q1 next year "** 
---
Fallout 76 disappointing yet again? shocker.
---
Might be a great time to grind raids with smoother servers.
---
I server hop between turn ins because a few months ago I turned in for 10 3\* ranged, back to back, and got 4 broadsiders, and 4 of the 10 weapons were ghoul slayers. So I try to break up the turn-ins now. Even if it does nothing, I don't want to experience 40% broadsiders again, and have not experienced any bad repeats since.
---
3/10
---
As far as prematurely blowing a gasket goes you performed well but it just doesnt have the certain "I dont know what" the other hissy fit posts have on the same topic.
---
Rust and Ark are also not live service games.  The Atomic shop is the differing factor here.  Like it or not, that is par for the course for these games.  Besides, we've long past consumer friendly options in AAA gaming space.  This should be a surprise to no one regardless.
---
Convenience or time saver items still fit within P2W.
---
I'm unfortunately still running the excavator armor, which I  like because of the +100 carry weight. Unfortunately, I am only about level 34 so I know will eventually find better.
---
 borderlands 3 was pretty shit and I doubt it even has a large playerbase especially on PC anymore.
---
&gt;They wanted it as an in game thing no one asked for it in the atom shop
---
That is simply wrong, there have been may posts, with tons of likes, that said they'd gladly pay to have it
---
Well, you wouldn't want Calmex and Daddy-O for a Rifle Junkie build cause you'd want the Perception. I'd replace it with Med-X and Psycho (since you should be hopped up on psycho all the time anyway, for the 25% damage boost)
---
Edit: Replace Psycho with Psychobuff if you're really worried about taking damage, from the -20 DR
---
I will definitely quit when that happens.
---
I'd wager that with whatever you've spent on consoles + multiplayer + games over the past year or however long you've owned that console, you could've built a PC, got as many games, and saved some money.
---
Look I make money I have a great job so spending on some content is okay with me. But spending money on a item that I can’t even make to shut the hell up makes me a little upset
---
What if I told you, you're gonna have both anyway, delay or not :P
---
To clarify a little bit of what u/zachychan013 said, say you have already earned all 5 pieces of the solar armor, this does not mean you now have a 50/50 shot of either getting thorn or strangler heart. The game could still "roll" that you get a solar armor plan, however since you have already earned them all you just get nothing.
---
IMO this is the most confusing/irritating part of that whole process
---
Try this? [https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting\_up\_a\_server](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server) 
---
With a guide and a bit of googling its not too difficult to setup.  That being said I usually pay for a minecraft server anyways for:
---
1. Ease of setup
---
2. I use lots of mods so hosting on my own machine can make the game a resource hog
---
3. Hosting on an external server means I get 100% uptime so I don't have to worry about restarting my PC or bogging down the server if I play something else
---
If you have an extra PC laying around then you could host it on that and not worry about points 2 or 3 though.  Also, if your kid is on the same network as you then you could just open the world to LAN and then you don't even need an external server.  Although then it is difficult for the other person to play without you unless you share the world files.
---
Thats why I said : maybe .... They have taken alot away from us . It's time they start giving things back . Especially when they want us to pay for private servers .
---
I dig that! I'd be super down for that!
---
How long does the purveyors discount last?
---
Weird you'd move on from 76 to games like...borderlands 3 and Outerworlds.
---
Wouldn't you want to move on to something actually good?
---
Yesterday on my daily grind you could say i found about 2 1\* star Legendaries and 1 3\* Legendary, that is in about something like 10 different encounters that are almost a guaranteed spawn. Not to mention Uranium Fever not spawning any enemies with a legendary fix.
---
u/valseek
---
Rose's quest (Flavor for Mayhem) is required for Recruitment Blues, they're both main quests. I've already started Flavor for Mayhem and it's not that bad but I am struggling a bit so Recruitment Blues isn't gonna happen soon. I have the marker for Mysteries, but I have no idea where the Excavators quest starts.
---
Would have bought those ha
---
That’s probably where I got my scrap kits from then. I know I didn’t buy them so assumed they were from the queen. Repair kits I’ve used when I get them from the queen. I see the usefulness of them. I guess maybe not as many people are struggling with their stash limit like me. LOL
---
No.  I'm conditioned to seek out mediocrity.
---
The Ultracite PA is pretty cool and a welcomed addition. I usually run T-60 w/ tricentennial paint. I’ve always been a fan of the T-60 so I stuck with it. Waiting to get that BOS Elder paint though!
---
Was so hopeful and excited untill reading that they will be charging for private servers. That's just money grabbing bullshit. BSG showing all they actually care about is money not the game or the players.
---
Right now its my strangler heart, hoping that Patch 14 fixes the acid bug in the queen fight
---
I get what your saying, so it is possible for a server to be weighted towards dropping certain perks or weapons, however that is completely decided by the generation of the seed? So basically the only way is to look for one of these servers is to look for any possible anomaly’s when finding multiple legendaries on one server🤔
---
I got nothing worthwhile after 16 legendary buys
---
Dont forget you're gonna pay for mods too.
---
&gt;I feel people are really doing a surprised Pikachu right now, and it's ridiculous.
---
Exactly correct. Businesses exist to make money and by doing so employ many people in dozens of roles. A product either makes a profit or it's not a product for long.
---
Too bad it's not coming until 2020 now!
---
That’s what I look forward to after a hard days work, farming plastic!
---
Not sure, kinda thinking shotgun vats this time. I think going str build will make it easy to switch back to heavy if I want later on
---
I like to mix and match but my favourite has gotta be the t60 with raider armour as a close second. Big fan of the cobbled together look, and the chunky feeding trough look of the 60
---
Regarding the private world's, "Our goal for players who purchase this service" please don't tell me we'll have to pay for our own server lmao.
---
Yeah you can go to the Morgantown airport and find the plan for the standard backpack. To get the better backpacks you have to go to railroad stations and look at the poster for the pioneer scouts. This will get you some new quests and challenges which will reward you with a backpack.
---
This is a dedicated server, not p2p. They aren't free
---
If we get an elder paint that would be amazing but I wonder how they would implement it
---
Yeah, that bit is rather confusing. Think I went 8 raids in a row without receiving a plan once haha
---
That’s kinda impossible, he is in the west coast until 20-30 years before fallout 3
---
Ultracite looks the best and it shares mods with the raid armor should I ever feel like grinding those.
---
I’d just feel weird to have to pay extra for a service, in a game we all payed full price for, in order for it to function as the game should. I know people will, I just won’t be one of them. 
---
Honestly I could see the server stability on public servers dropping in order for make people buy private. Praying it doesn’t happen, but... it’s realistic
---
Im glad you put a arrow there. Would of missed it without it
---
Well, I'm due a break from the game anyway with Outer Worlds, Modern Warfare and Death Stranding all on the horizon, so I'm not heartbroken about Wastelanders being delayed. As long as it's polished when it does eventually drop I can live with it.
---
I don't do PvP so I honestly don't care about what they put in the Atomic Shop. I've bought cosmetic stuff for my camp, but I've never bought or used a single repair kit and I haven't bought the fridge. I got the Collectron with Atoms I earned in game, but even that was only to have it wandering around saying funny stuff. Half the time I forget to check it.
---
Private servers is an interesting idea. Worth looking at if the price is right, but not sure I'm that interested at the moment. If there were other benefits for a monthly fee then I might consider it. I've paid subs on other games like ESO and DC Universe Online for additional benefits, so would be open to something like that.
---
Anyway, time to go spend some scrip and see how lucky I am.
---
I don’t care for lore... give me Harold!
---
I havent played the vaults yet is the strangler heart it's own PA or a skin?
---
This.  To expand on the comment about the chance to earn the plans you will generally earn a plan 100% of the time at first.  The last 2 or 3 plans probably took me maybe 15 or so completions on expert or standard to earn.  
---
That was the same across 2 characters that both know all the plans and have full sets of strangler PA.  
---
In any case you will have the plans by the time you farm up the 162 steel.  
---
Lastly make sure you equip superduper and power smith when crafting :)  If you want to get super into it, get a full set of unyielding for +15 int and eat some grape mentats for +5 int - this will increase the maximum durability of the resulting armor pieces by a tad.  Not necessary imo but just throwing that out there.
---
Meg was also in the original trailer for wastelanders I think. Btw I hope they give us Duchess' outfit in the atom shop soon. It's super slick.
---
I also think part of the delay may have been that through development they decided they wanted to add even in regards to the NPCs, which of course requires more time
---
You are asking very difficult question friend. They don't have any answer for you. They don't know either. 
---
Q1 2020 means somewhere between January 2020 and January 2021.
---
This. So this. Get that screen out of here. Make a new screen every patch up until Wastelanders as a teaser to build hype.
---
I never knew it shared mods with it that's something I'm gonna have to grind out
---
Same.. easily 2000+ hours combined in the other bethesda fallouts
---
Thats what we were promised tho.
---
You have to pay to not deal with PVP, thats all I saw.
---
I got 2 3* wolves outside Uncanny Cavern, 2 3* mirelurks in the Wendigo Cave. 2 2* supermutants at Top of the World, 2 2-3* robots in Pharma, wandered into some sheepsquatches while wandering around, and did Leader of the Pack twice to get six low level legendaries.
---
That is what I hear. You may want to confirm.
---
go to ebay and drop $80 on an explosive gatling plasma.  Solo all the content and win every pvp engagement = p2w!! :P
---
Right, what I've been doing since I noticed servers are different is logging out, logging in and killing a few more Legendaries on the new server
---
&gt;Making it obtainable in game would require adding quests or events 
---
Or just grind for the atoms on daily/weekly/combat/world/character challenges.  It really doesn't take that long to grind out 800 if you're determined to do it
---
Lies.
---
Hey excavator still really good I'd say it's the most durable out of them all and has the most utility the only down side is it doesnt protect you as much as the rest but that's partly what makes it unique
---
Like I said I don’t really farm for scrip anymore so I’m not trading scrip for multiple weapons at a time. However, I do recall two instances when I used to trade in around 150 scrip a day for 3-2* legendary weapons. The first case I got all pistols (two pipe bolt action pistols, and a pipe revolver, in that order) and the second time was all heavy weapons (missle launcher, and two back-to-back broadsiders) both super strange instances but I just took it for bad luck at the time. Wouldn’t surprise me though considering my experience especially at West Tech legendary Super Mutant spawns across different servers.
---
It's already been implemented as a reward for returning technical data. You have to get the other paint schemes first though.
---
Alright great to know
---
I dont see why not, since you're going to have to buy the mods ala creation club. Disabling them for a regular server shouldnt be hard, or break anything. But then again, its bethesda
---
I'm level 115 and still use my excavator. I put the mods into it give me +200 carry weight and +2 Strength. 
---
I'm a hoarder... It's a serious problem.
---
Your joking? I had no idea gonna have to grind that out now
---
It looks really cool. Only bad thing is the randomization of it. Just have to keep turning in those Technical Docs.
---
Good luck with that. I've been doing it for about a month and only just got the knight scheme.
---
Really, it's capitalism at play.  They made the product, they can decide how they market it.  Some people will not like it, others won't care.  Such is the nature of business.
---
Fucking excuse me. This was promised as a *feature* before launch, not an additional service or extra purchase. Being able to host a private server in the future is literally the one reason I bought this dumb game in the first place.
---
&gt;since you're going to have to buy the mods ala creation club.
---
That isn't confirmed. In fact, Bethesda calling them 'mods' and not 'creations', basically all but confirms they're not.
---
Bethesda never uses the word 'Mod' to describe Creation Club items, they have always use the word 'Creation' in all official news releases for items relating to that service.
---
When Bethesda uses the word 'mods' now they mean the free stuff.
---
Back when they were part of Valve's test of paid mods on Steam, yes they did use that word (since Valve did), but they haven't since they added Creation Club to FO4/Skyrim.
---
Now, since the private worlds are more than likely not client side, mods will probably have to go through an approval process yeah. But I doubt they'll be paid.
---
It's not greed it's called making money so they can employ people. It's really simple economics.
---
I think the ultimate p2w will be killing the grafton mayor. The REAL final boss.
---
Eh delaying Wastelanders will just cause player drop off most likely. Get they want it to be polished but I've only been jumping on once in awhile and was anticipating Wastelanders. 
---
It is a smart move if they're really ramping up Wastelanders to be an overhaul... But Bethesda is going to have to go about it as a soft relaunch and not just a "DLC" to get new players and others to come back in 2020.
---
Every item you just named was released 5 or more months ago. We want new content please.
---
I had a very different experience, but I'm not surprised because I have watched other people do playthroughs and have similar differing experiences. The engine is kinda... *Quirky*. lol
---
If they will allow hosting games on private computers people will stop duping guns and just spawn them on demand, that’s the sad reality 😔

---
I really hope this is added
---
haha yeah, it's gonna be a shit show
---
I've never had a broadsider in my inventory. 2/4 of my lunchtime Purveyor results were broadsiders. Go figure.
---
The simple tip I have - keep only the weapons and effects you want - purge everything else.  I can see a correlation now - rolling explosive, faster fire rate and faster swing speed often enough.  I have like zero junk effects across my account like limb damage, bugged 250DR reloading, etc...  those are purged as soon as I can scrip them.
---
Would you be so kind as to point out where they didn't deliver on their promise?
---
Biggest concern I have with Bethesda currently is that if they keep doing things like this then they are going to lose favour with their fanbase, and before Starfield is due that's not a good thing to lose! Such a vocal community is an asset if you think of the PR we all inadvertently do.
---
When you’re high level and have done most of the challenges it’s not as easy, plus it’s not as fun. Would’ve been cool to have it tied into an event or quest line or something and then sell skins for it in the atom shop.
---
I'll still be on everyday , been playing every day since 11-14-18, I missed the beta. But I just enjoy being there. Got four characters now, all fully geared for pve.  But I don't just play, my wife and I watch our shows on Netflix, got two televisions in the living room. Staying afk keeping the vendor open for business while doing chores. It's probably because of that gaming method I'm not bored like lots of others yet. I totally get why lots of you want to take a break.
---
I don't know about you, but I keep my teeth in my head.
---
I’m an idiot, you are correct. Dunno how I blanked on that fact.
---
What would you consider "actually good"?
---
(Genuinely curious.  I haven't played any other new games since '76 came out.)
---
Oh they certainly can but its usually fairly uncommon to go in and make changes to the engine because you are messing with the basis for how everything is run in the game. Mess with the wrong line and whole systems that rely on it collapse.
---
That's the other build and I have 5 unyielding and 5 bolstering. But with the current build of using unyeilding all the way and my perks situated, I have better armor capability. Once Bethesda decides to increase the stash box after the servers are more stable once more, then I will add bolstering again.
---
I feel that every build is good to have so you can switch back and forth but it's a pain to switch builds in the middle of combat. Wish Bethesda could create a system that you can select and your perk cards will switch around based on what enemy you fight.
---
Wanna bet? :)
---
Yea Im really excited for the Halloween event
---
Picture or it dindt happen
---
For all intent and purposes it is a legendary suit of PA. The complete set "Adds Acid Damage to all armed attacks and makes nearby enemies take Acid Damage."
---
It does have a bug in the queen event where the acid damage stacks too much and basically bricks everyone's game but this should be addressed in Patch 14 I believe, simple solution would be to limit the max amount of times it can stack
---
As badass as X0-1 is, always gotta go with the classic t-51b. It’s just a super sleek, yet rugged design that for all intents and purposes looks like a realistic “power-armor” design. Plus I’m a dedicated BoS freak so I’m a lil biased...Ad Victoriam! I will say I love the Ultracite PA, use that for nuke zones and Blackbird t-51b for heavy combat zones and fun (play/rp as BoS spec ops, so tend to stick to stealth and trusty 10mm SMG).
---
It's all about praying to RNG-esus
---
Fallout shelter has way more necessary microtransactions. 
---
Comparing the two isn't really valid IMO, its a totally different model game. The Mr. Handy alone is game changing.
---
Well, we dont have enough info to properly determine how, if in any way, modding will be limited.
---
We'll have to wait and see on that.
---
 But the private worlds being limited to a bethesda operated service inherently limits the kind of modding we'll be able to do. Things like the various script extenders we get for Skyrim, Fallout, etc.. They more than likely wont be possible, because those require direct access to game files.
---
The fuck?? Who the Hell would pay actual money (money that can buy a 4K TV with) for that??? That's beyond crazy.
---
No, because I don't like to gamble.
---
It's a family issue.
---
I just want to say I love how they reflected on player feedback and were encouraged to add more non cosmetic items even though I'm pretty sure most of us voiced our disgust at the practice.
---
Then again they probably ignored that feedback and were talking about monetary statistics on a chart because I feel they care more about that than the consumer often times.
---
no no no, it isn't his luck it is clearly the server's fault
---
I'm a hoarder too. So I don't feel so bad keeping the excavator! It's just a pain in the ass to keep fusion cores around.
---
Are you using stabilized? Also two shot is not that great because it comes with a huge accuracy penalty
---
I have had this happen too, unfortunately I was only level 10 so I couldn’t do much :(
---
I actually like these suggestions a lot. Even if themes applied to dailies it would be a nice change.
---
Sure is, and I also have watched other people do playthroughts, still never seen it happen outside of 76 and it happens quite frequently. Im currently playing TTW.
---
In an RPG sense? Your character from the very get go is a middle aged war vet or lawyer. Zero choice on your part. It isn't even really your character, rather a character that Bethesda made that you are just controlling.
---
This trend of little or no choice runs in complete opposition to the spirit of roleplaying games.
---
Extra Armor pen from what? Genuinely curious here.
---
Edit- the powerfist, got it thanks. Will give this a whirl :)
---
FYI, that event starts the following week on the 29th
---
It depends if we can do like Survival and go back and forth between Adventure and Private servers. Seems like they monetized both the people who don't want to fuck with PVP and the people that want to Mod their game. Not much info yet really to bother, everyone is just speculating or creating an uproar. I'll be playing Outer Worlds while they iron out that mess between now and Wastelanders anyway.
---
inquiry, do you keep a wide variety of weapons on you most of the time?
---
Glad to see this push. There’s still several kinks to work out when it comes to QoL so having a little extra cushion to sort those will be good. Plus gives more time to work on what was coming in 2020. More time means more time to PT and (hopefully) catch issues. 
---
Question though, u/Ladydevann : will this push back the PvP changes mentioned in September?
---
Atomic Shop. You know, I’ve been noticing in the splash screens little lunch boxes that say Vault Tec. Fairly sure that’s what they are. Hoping they’re just props tho. Lord knows what’s inside those lunch boxes. We have enough XP boosts and damage boosts in the fame already. We don’t need to buy them, even with in-game earned atoms.
---
Regarding private servers, is there anything you can can tell us when it comes to being able to use a character in both your private server and Adventure mode? I feel like that’ll be good for everyone. Players who want a more single-player experience can play on the private servers. Players who wanna farm ammo for hours at the workshop can do so without worrying about PVP and come back. A cheat-fix whatever you call it could be if a character has been on a private server with certain types of mods, they cannot come back to Adventure mode. Like, if a private server is modded to break the game in some way that gives an ungodly benefit, like unlimited ammo or something, that character could be locked to that private server. But if a mod is just a Survival-like boost to XP, I don’t see the harm. Of course this would require BGS to have access to that information for those servers, and I don’t know if they would. 
---
Honestly I’m just excited to hear more about them.
---
I had it in fallout 3 and skyrim.
---
rifleman/commando
---
tank killer
---
bloody mess
---
ground pounder/concentrated fire
---
and if you decide to go for a stealthy approach ad sneak
---
covert operative
---
escape artist
---
If you think they'll be free, you haven't been following Bethesda for long enough.
---
I get people ragging on you because they dont think the atom shop is "pay to win" bit I kinda agree. Had the player base not gorge into these "utility items" maybe everything would still be cosmetic. But oh well, people wanna shuffle out money for something that SHOULD be free updates or stuff to earn in game, we wouldnt have this problem. 
---
Make the stuff earnable. And dont give me that "earn atoms from challenges" shit.  I want challenges to earn those items. I want events to earn those items. I want someone to enter the game, and ask other players how they got these "utility items" and tell them what quest, event, or challenge they need to do. 
---
Brings playability to this game, brings players to spend more hours online, brings more comaradery, more gameplay. But nope, spend the cash dipshit
---
I've stopped playing again for the moment. I dont see much point, I am sorta bored with repeating the same quests and events constantly at this point.
---
Il hop back on when the new timed event is happening, then I guess il wait till next year.
---
Really disappointed they're going with a "give us more money" route with private servers. That was my last hope for 76 aaaaaand they killed it. Oh well.
---
Some things that might help: 
---
Try to keep under 100 of every base junk type in the stash. Anything over: bulk and sell. Some exceptions I have are for things to make ammo (lead, steel, etc). If those are over 100. Go make ammo.
---
Keep the bare minimum for aid. Just enough for a crisis. Even these can be taken out of the stash.
---
If you have a pa piece(s) in your stash, throw them on a chassis. Two full sets of T-60 on chassis are lighter than 1 set in your pocket, and a T-60 torso with jet pack sitting in the stash.
---
Reflect on guns in your stash and “do I really use this?”
---
The nuclear flux and materials to make it are a bit trickier. The materials are heavy, so I keep only up to 10 of each (high radiation fluids I’ve started to make exceptions for due to rarity, and it shows) as for flux keep some on hand, but do you really need 50 yellow cake? I’ve started making prime fusion cells to help eat up crimson flux, and I’m working on getting a mutation serum plan to eat up yellow cake (they sell for a lot at vendors)
---
Hope these help.
---
Had some good luck at purveyor earlier- https://imgur.com/a/nUvhwAl
---
2 fixers and some explosive weapons, even a ffr railway.
---
Honestly at least its a fairly decent trade-off. A private server where i can build my own world is worth giving them more time. And itll probably help with the instacing stuff that they talk about.
---
Wrong. this wasnt the first request for a fridge. the bethesda reply even says this.
---
it was just the first one where someone said he would even pay atoms for it. thats maybe why it has a bethesda reply and thats maybe why we got finally a fridge... from the atom shop...
---
As a backup maybe, we'll see how it goes
---
\*handmade
---
My alt got it on his first and only time joining it. I've probably only done it a couple times on my main and he knew the plan.
---
You might have to make a whole new character for private servers. I guess we won't know until Tuesday.
---
Because there are so many reasons to “seed” servers with only certain combinations
---
Edit ok maybe not, I just equipped my TSE minigun from my stash just for shits and giggles to see if it influenced and I get a TS minigun what are the odds
---
Edit 2 also definetly seeded holy shit
---
I have the other besides the sneaky one I'll have to look into bloody mess and ground pounder.
---
Oh trust me I have a Bloodied Minigun Primed and that too also burns through a lot but my god its a literal god at the SBQ and Imposter Sheep.
---
Here’s my question. I pay for my own server, my friends load in, all is good. I can then take a workshop and not worry about pvp? I could take the power stations and have cores all day long. Or ammo although it’s easier to craft ammo at this point.
---
Yeah auto correct. Didn't notice it before I posted it.
---
t51 for its stats but also for it's mods. Couple of different combos based on what I need. But have one dedicated to raids and one for adventuring.
---
I swear to god if they make people pay for the option to host it themselves I'm never buying another Bethesda product again. You don't get to make people pay for something they have to make themselves. That's like goigg to a restaurant, and you pay $20, and instead they say "ok now that you gave us $20 you can now go home and cook dinner". Like no, I payed, YOU make dinner.
---
This wouldnt be as bad, had they said this a month ago. I'm tired of Bethesda telling us this shit at the deadline, you couldve told us this long ago and people wouldnt be this mad.
---
 Hi tired, I'm Dad!
---
I've found that chanting "ass n tiddies ass n tiddies ass n tiddies" has led to nothing but bad luck. Don't do that. It will make all your drops ass
---
I can wait...its a good trade off and hey it sounds like they are listening more...
---
If there is a valid free option and they exclude that and only favour the paid one, while the majority of games feature either none or both together, of course people will be angry and rightfully so.
---
There could be something that looks at your existing inventory while generating a Purveyor item and giving some weight to making something similar to what you have but the evidence is anecdotal as far as I know.  Likewise there seems to be a random number seed assigned to your character upon login that helps in determining various things related to loot (and maybe encounters) but again evidence is anecdotal.  If you want to try pursing this then restrict your inventory to what you want to get and if you are getting unwanted weapons/armor characteristics change servers after of buys until get 'hot' and then splurge.  I make no claims for this working, it is based on reports from various redditors.
---
One of the things I suggested was adding small quests to reward these new items, the fridge, bot etc. And moving their plans to the pool that every vendor has. But hey, oh well.
---
Ughhh
---
I wanna be ghoul :(
---
Pls Beth I want Charisma Ghoul Build
---
I bought mine for 17000 caps. It's just too frustrating when I take all the pylons and the people there still can't kill it while I'm spamming stims like a madman.
---
well shouldnt take too long in that case have fun man 👍🏼
---
Things could be much, much worse *cough* Ghost Recon *cough*
---
Sure thing, but be sure to be there BEFORE someone runs through 94 during a nuke drop. You might just have to watch everything float off into the Ethereal Plane
---
E: I love how no one gets this is a joke. That’s this sub in a nut shell though. Negativity = REEEEEEEEEE
---
I don't think free to play is going to be the direction they go in. I know a few people who have purchased more than 5 accounts, with the primary purpose being ban evasion. Imagine what the hacker and duper community will look like if Bethesda goes free-to-play with the current state of the game. Don't get me wrong, are they stupid enough to do it? Yes. But I don't think they will.
---
As a member of this community from the beginning I can tell you Bethesda doesn't care.
---
They have repeatedly shown they will remain silent in regards to any criticism, legitimate or otherwise.
---
Their community managers do not interact on these issues, but man will they comment in threads about bags of shit being left on peoples beds.
---
I love this game, I really do, but the decisions being made are horrible and they have had zero transparency about any of this stuff.
---
They already flat out lied to you about the Atomic Shop, no reason for them to stop there.
---
I'll be back in 2020 for waste Landers... They delayed it... I'm keeping my stuff
---
&gt; what are the odds
---
idk, I'm an architect not a statistician...
---
Lol instead of making atomic shop items more reasonably priced, they’re just making overpriced QOL items that should be free. This game was $60, remember?
---
Might be fun; pity shotguns got nerfed so hard. Anyway, good luck to you and happy hunting.
---
Well i'd say it falls in line with some other games that people enjoy. You ARE playing a more specific identity which is kind of the point. Its happened before. Im not saying Beth should continue in that direction, but I don't think its totally uncalled for. That being said, the bit about getting power armor in the beginning always confused me somewhat. I mean if having power armor equates to "god mode" as you say, then I don't think it really matters WHEN you get it, since no matter what, wearing power armor will make you "god mode". I believe the intention was clear though. It supposed to be like a tool rather than just "the highest level armor you can get" equal to daedric or something from TES.
---
Skyrim made money and they didn't have to monetize every single aspect of the game.
---
Thank you for the unnecessary sarcasm
---
I've been walking in a circle picking up the same can for what feels like centuries already. I'm just holding on for BOS content to show up in the Atom shop.
---
It's not actually, engine changes happen with pretty much every patch.
---
I'll prolly take a break after the Halloween event comes out, with the new call of duty and outer worlds coming out it will give me something different to do but I'll come back about a month before wastelanders drops
---
But i'm sure they'll bring it to PTB first, so "maybe" they'll fix them before release
---
So basically, they’re going to add more *utility* items to the atomic shop because they sell the best, great... 
---
This is a very PR friendly way of saying the atomic shop will have way more gameplay altering options. 
---
This is concerning. I really thought they’d be going in the opposite direction
---
Easy solution: Separate characters between modes.
---
You can copy your character from official to private but not vice versa. Problem solved.
---
Me and my friends played on self hosted versions of all the big name survival games. Rust, Ark, Conan Exiles, Dont Starve Together, Minecraft and some others that are less known and it was fine, we can deal with lag, latency, rubberbanding and whatever, we just want to play together in quiet at our own pace and leasure.
---
If my character wont be valid for official servers its completely fine, thats something that is done on literally any other game like this anyway, so its not a valid reason they shouldnt offer local/self hosts or even complete offline play.
---
People paid for it already, why not make it available as a true SP instance if they even offer it with paid services?
---
Ok im on xbox but if the game goes cross platform you can count me in
---
One way it could work is with a dedicated private server character. It can be a fully mature toon and their inventory or a new one. Either way once that toon crosses the line, there’s no going back to public. You could use that toon in your own or a friend’s private server only. This would stop the flow of private goods getting onto public servers.
---
I am running my Ultracite with the Black rider paint love the way it looks, and my X01 armor with the Pale rider paint. Both are equipped with the Free States Jet pack. T-60 with BOS paint is my reserve unit.
---
It's an incredibly crappy feeling knowing I have to wait for wastelanders but so long as the delay is to better it then so be it. I'm willing to wait a few more months or a bit longer. Good luck and thanks to the devs, I know y'all are working hard.
---
A lot of people said that when they released the cameras oh, and we still ended up teleporting across the map.
---
joke's on you, lots of the players who have left have several legacies in their inventories that will never see the light of day again.
---
When the purveyor first came out I would get some BOS heavy armor but I haven't seen any BOS armor or any type of heavy armor myself for quite some time.
---
Did you scrip the 1st one right after you got it?
---
Fedora is a one hundred percent guarantee. I have a stash full of them.
---
Personally I would have the upgrade progression be a part of some of the quests, one being getting your first set of excavator power armour where upon completion you get plans and one of three upgrades, being storage or build radius, the plan would be for a small portable miner, depending in the area you are in you get a small amount of materials being in different areas
---
I’ve gotten heavy robot pieces before.
---
Personally I think a mini-story content update would be nice. Keep me invested for the next few months. Like a wastelanders episode one or something. Nothing huge, maybe some lead-up missions without NPC’s, or maybe the SBQ starts spawning in different nuked fissures. 
---
Maybe you could nuke robco to spawn a liberty prime to fight? Combined with a robot and/or cyborg horde that defeats all the scorched? 
---
Something to keep things from going stale the next few months. Atom shop updates are cool, but not enough to keep me from jumping over to Outer Worlds for a few months.
---
Wait when is it coming out now? Or do we not have a set date?
---
As with every announcement Beth makes there are going to be those who say things they don’t mean, and I’m sure they’ll be back eventually. Just a matter of how soon Beth can get their stuff together and start pushing out better than “decent” content.
---
The difference is live service.  I can't think of any live service game offhand that allows this?  Maybe GTA Online but I believe that was forced due to peer to peer hosting.  And GTA Online is non conventional in how it handles live service ( no separate currency ).
---
u/immortaldimentio
---
Yeah,if the best BGS can do is some Christmas items for the holidays then I'm not coming back until 2020. Will either stick to Borderlands or maybe pick up the outer world's. 
---
It seams like the game really lost steam, and as much as I love the game I hope it's because the live model isn't as profitable as they expected and future titles will go back to the old paid DLC model. Who cares if it splits up the player base? Half of the people here want to play alone anyways. We got seriously shorted on content though, by this point in Fallout 4's release cycle we had 5 DLCs including 2 completely new maps, new world areas, and new game mechanics.
---
At least IMO what we've gotten so far amounts to about the same amount of content as Automatron.
---
I did not.
---
Ever heard of self hosting? Completely free for Bethesda and everything the majority wanted, offline play.
---
Since Beta..
---
I have a 3 star legendary War Drum that is Instigating, gives 1Agility and has 2x swing speed.... I call it "El KaBONG"
---
Wastelanders delayed: I'm ok with this. Will still probably have some annoying bugs but if it's better overall because of a delay in fine with that. 
---
Private servers: Depending on price I might get one. I didn't in anything like Battlefield but we'll see. 
---
Atom shop stuff: Worried. I'll wait and see what these utility things are but really not a fan of the idea.
---
I haven’t got the fucking Fixer plan and I’m really trying to grind it before the weekend ends
---
X-01 Quantum Paint. Thicc legs for carry weight, Medic Pump chest for those queen fights and if I need to PvP, Recon Sensor head. I know him as Quantum Bitch.
---
What are you talking about? Where did I say anything about power armor???
---
Are you referring to my use of godmodding? It is a Role-playing term
---
https://forumroleplay.com/roleplay-guides/bad-roleplay/
---
Fallout 4 is a bad RPG because it makes bad RPG decisions. It may be a decent game but it is objectively a bad ROLE-PLAYING game.
---
Fallout (as in one and two) was the gold standard of single player role playing for quite some time, so expecting new games in the franchise to at least pay RPGs lip service shouldn't be unrealistic
---
Yeah, its.probaboy a waste of 500 caps, but at this point it's more of an OCD thing manifested from spending way too much time on camp building out of pre-Wastelanders boredom. Which only seems headed on a worse trajectory with today's announcement
---
They just said Q1 of 2020
---
It’s delayed because there is more work than they expected. And you want to add more work to that? Makes sense.. I understand there is a bit of a stretch with no content but I’d rather it be delayed and working than on time and breaks the game.
---
Shut up, you're not my real dad!
---
Not usually, no. I keep my Deathclaw Gauntlet and a single gun, usually a modded Combat Rifle, Hunting Rifle, or Combat Shotgun. Never a heavy weapon.
---
I spent 1000 script, went one 3 star and two 2 star then repeat, got almost absolute crap. Even with a full Unyielding set and  food/drink/chems to boost Charisma/Luck. Did get a Bloodied Gatling Laser.  
---
Guess I burned my luck last week with this [Harpoon Gun](https://i.imgur.com/5653kmI.png)

The only way to stop that would be to put out a solid Halloween event, then drop another event for Thanksgiving (that could be a bit smaller if necessary), and then they'd STILL need a strong Xmas event (bigger than Halloween).
---
I don't see them doing all 3 though quite honestly.
---
Someone REALLY desperate.
---
I did get the imposter Sheepsquatch head gear, so that was nice. I guess.
---
Could always just be a 4 month break. I've got high Hopes for Wastelanders but maybe that's just me being overly optimistic.
---
On PS4, there is still unbearable lag in empty servers!
---
I will thanks for the tips
---
np :)
---
Pay to win is shit, pay to have fun sounds like if i dont pay it will be grindy as shit...
---
It hope we wont see either but i fear for the worst after that statement...
---
Basically, they're going to design Wastelanders with some inconveniences that exist to encourage people to pay for a solution for the inconveniences. You know, like food spoiling. 
---
This really sucks, but it seems like that's where things are going. 
---
Inconveniences are a huge part of game design, and invalidating them with purchasable workarounds makes the whole experience feel pointless. Now every new gameplay system will be questioned by players, which isn't a great position.
---
Vault 96 dissapeared from the NW roadmap.  With how laggy 94 is, I can see why.
---
Seeing as I am on Xbox, yes I will. Seeing as I want to, I shall.
---
You have to pay for it
---
I just came back. I have yet to do Arktos or any Vault raids because of the bugs.  
---
I’ll come back for Wastelanders
---
All about preference honestly. If you like stealth, do a handmade/commando stealth build. If you like run and gun  quick &amp; high damage do a bloodied commando. If you like hunting rifles and snipers do a riflemans build, if you like heavy weapons do a power armor/50 cal/mini gun build. And finally, if you like melee one hits (Do not recommend one-hitting everything) do a bloodied melee build. Most perks are self explanatory. If you need help making this build let me know. I'm always willing to help. It's pretty easy once you realize how to manage your perks correctly. Most of those people that are one hitting things are people that have flew through the game and maxed their characters build out early and now they just farm legendaries that are insane. Either way, just know that it's really easy to match these players with a simple build of one type. I done a Bloodied Melee/Rifle build on my last toon and it done 3k melee damage with like 250 combat rifle damage.  So either way I had a pretty tanked character. Before I ever considered the rifle build I done solely Melee. And I was one hitting literally everything. And nobody liked it so I started carrying a rifle around to do decent  damage without taking all the XP and loot. Just remember. No matter the build you do don't be the douche that sits back and one hits everything taking all the xp and glory for themselves. Again, PM me if you need any help setting one of these builds up. I've done nearly all of them and know the workarounds for them all.
---
I think Bethesda will have private servers to serve the niche communities. A Camp Builders server would have bigger camp budgets but maybe less people on the server? You will probably gain something and loose something compared to the "public" servers when you choose to play on a private server.
---
Wonder If they'll allow some type of one way move of an existing character to a private server?
---
Jokes on you, those are dupe trash and have thousands of copies already floating around
---
I doubt they’ll increase build/stash budget just for private servers. The reason being cause switching back to Adventure would be impossible on that same character. Even if you were forced to make a new one for private servers, there would have to be a set max-limit of players so the server knows how much space to dedicate to each person, a feature I doubt Beth will implement at launch if at all, we’ll just have to wait and see unfortunately.
---
One way "copying" of characters seems like it would be essential for this to work.
---
Vault 96 currently is completely unaccessable. Not that I didnt expect that after we gained early access. 
---
A small seasonal event to keep users using would be nice but since meat week just rewrapped up I dont see that as a possibility until after the Halloween event.
---
Edit: Winter roadmap will probably be filled with QoL improvements and maybe, just maybe... The potential for private servers :D
---
Editx2: Holy shite boys [Today's release](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more) literally shaking with excitment for private worlds **next week**
---
This game should’ve been singleplayer with multiplayer components. This all just feels wrong
---
Just as a mission reward and not in the Atom Store!
---
Spent 950 scrips.  4 weapons considering keeping - Berserker's Minigun, Medic's The Fixer, Quad Combat Rifle, Vamp Ultracite Gatling Laser.  Donated the rest in a train station blue luggage bag.
---
Nothing spectacular that I haven't seen in many player vending machines but can possibly sell at a nice profit.
---
Today was good nevertheless.  Bought a TSE 50 Cal and got a 3\* drop with a Bloodied Assaultron Head.  Yesterday was decent also buying 3\* TSE Pump Shotgun.
---
Bloodied missile launcher can be beneficial in some situations! But you really wanna have RW so I understand lol
---
Same!  A lot of us have the resources to do this.
---
Lmao I was like who TF said that?? The sub imploded every time they would add some shit that is not cosmetic. What a way to say "yeah we're not listening to that shit." Fucking hell the balls on these guys
---
Sorry. I assumed you meant the fact that they give you power armor in the beginning of the game which is something I have seen a  number of people complain about. Forgive me but I am not entirely sure what you are referring to.
---
Why would you want this?
---
Yeah, the momentum of cleaning the wasteland and building all the scrip is thrown out. Just forget it. Gonna do my 50% rolls then quit till waste
---
This was not the news I was hoping to hear but it really isn't a surprise either. I hope this means that Wastelanders will be problem free but Bethesda doesn't have a great track record so far so we'll see. Fingers crossed.
---
Private servers coming so soon is interesting and like others have said, there will almost certainly be a monthly fee. I suppose it'd be unreasonable to hope that a character would be able to move from a public server to a private one and back again. Either way, seems like Bethesda is eager to get a steady income stream going.
---
Which brings me to the Atom Shop. I'm not the only one who has been thoroughly annoyed with the Atom Reward / Challenge system compared to the pricing of cosmetic items and bundles on the shop. The Free States Bundle costs more than some of the fully developed Fallout 4 DLCs and is half a dozen - a dozen items? Then there are the repair kits and scrap kits. Neither of which are exactly necessary though they certainly cut through a lot of inconvenience which still fits into P2W in my opinion. So if a person wants to fully enjoy the benefits of the Atom Shop they're going to have to kick in some real cash. And yes, yes, if I don't agree with then don't spend my money. So far, I haven't.
---
However I also realize that Bethesda has to make this profitable somehow. That's basic business. I get that. So out of curiosity I took a look at the membership for Elder Scrolls Online. ESO Plus members, for a monthly membership of $15 get a nice little bundle of bonuses. Including increased bank space, increase in experience &amp; gold earning, an allowance of crowns, full access to all DLC game packs, etc.
---
So why not offer something similar to Fallout 76 players? Would anyone else be interested in making this a subscription based game if it meant subscribers got access to a boat load of perks and non paying players got basically the game we have now? I mean they're making it P2W anyway. Why not be completely open and honest about it?   
---
(edit spelling corrections)
---
I can usually pull a 3 star out of Wes Tec
---
I need to add shocks to mine. Think that’s what I’ll do tonight. Only way to get the plans is but then at the robot vendor? Just want to be sure before I do that and then find out there’s some other way. Have to seen them in a player vendor at all.
---
Agreed. The announcement of Wastelanders is what brought me back to the game. It being delayed is definitely a blow but I am willing to wait if it means they work to better it. I hope they really upgrade the stability and everything of the game.
---
That'll be 1000 atoms please.
---
Yeah. That's fair. Idk I guess that didn't bother me enough to deter me. I got used to not carrying any junk (or extra aid in survival) so any junk in my bags are just what I picked up recently. Although I'd definitely avoid PvP if I was bringing a good haul of lead home or something haha.
---
I'll admit I was secretly relieved when they cut down the caps loss in survival. I definitely put myself out there more knowing I wasn't going to lose thousands of caps in a sesh. Some guys out there made a ton of caps off of me back then!
---
If you want a sneak peak to see some bugs just go watch discovery channel haha.
---
I run commando, tank killer, bloody mess, tormentor, demolitions expert, Adrenaline. 2 pts into sneak for more stealth damage. I dont use vats.
---
They should really give us an option to mess with it in setting, something like this   
---
Defult title screen (the current screen)  
---
Launch day Screen  
---
Wild  Appalachia Screen  
---
Nuclear Winter Screen  
---
just so we can change it if we get sick of seeing the current one.
---
Seriously fuck bethesda at this point. This whole thing is a disaster.
---
Probably not the borderlands game everyone forgot about a week after launch and the Chinese knockoff borderlands clone being made by obsidian
---
Executioners Sheepsquash Staff w/ limb dmg &amp; weight reduction
---
Yeah that's what I do lately, put the armor on when I need it.
---
If you are using heavy weapons, make sure you have all 3 heavy weapons perk cards maxed, as well as Stabilizer. Find a gatling gun and you should be able to 1-hit enemies below level 30 or so.
---
&gt;A free private server means you never buy atoms again (why would you if you can mod it?) . 
---
And yet Fallout 4, which is still able to be modded on all platforms, has the Creation Club and that's clearly doing just fine. Heck, I've modded the shit out of my Fallout 4 game and still buy stuff from the Creation Club.
---
&gt;Let's not forget the games entire revenue model hinges on atom shop purchases. 
---
And yet we beg them to add utility stuff to the game through quests and then put skins for those utilities in the Atom Shop and do they listen? No. Which is one of the biggest reasons, besides a lack of noticeable improvement in game stability, why I've stopped purchasing atoms altogether. 
---
Everything I've got from the Atom Shop over the past few weeks has been the free stuff. Last time I used atoms to unlock things was when the yellow flower wallpaper was out and when they were vaulting that one power armor station skin. For both of those, I only got them because I'd managed to earn enough atoms in game to unlock them, so even those two items didn't cost me a single cent.
---
&gt;That's suicide for this game.
---
What's suicide for this game is how they've been treating their player base as of late. If this game survives long enough for Wastelanders to come out, that alone will be a miracle. They don't care about their players anymore. They only care about the money. They've become just as bad as EA.
---
In the business world this means "We want you to think its going to be January, but it will most likely be the end of March"
---
Serious question. Would you rather not have high stakes pvp interactions like this? I thought that was apart of the game/experience.
---
New atomic shop paid title screens coming right up!
---
Got 2 fixers so far. 
---
1 instigating, rw, +33 vats
---
1 troubleshooters, exploding, +1 perception 
---
Not too shabby, couple of decent not great handmade as well. Only rolled about 8 times.
---
Interesting thanks. Does demolition work with the exploding bullets?
---
I keep saying this lol, knew there'd be a lot of unprepared encumbered people today
---
Which in layman's terms is Jan, Feb, or Mar
---
Noticed that if you keep something you’ll start getting more of it.
---
exactly. I’d much rather wait for a (hopefully) stable, content filled expansion than a buggy, lack of content mess
---
They cost real money... so fuck em
---
My plan, take a short break from nonstop fo76 for some rdr2.
---
Also, I've gotta grind my NW level. I really want that samurai helmet
---
And? You act suprised. I figured that from the get go. And is that helps them pay their crew and such then all i can say is shut up and take my caps. I want this to be good because you can see them going back to the original lore but keeping it fresh.
---
You need a dedicated server otherwise itll run like ass and everyone is tethered to a certain distance of eachother, my ark dedicated server cost me 12$ a month
---
Nope, not in my opinion. If this game has taught me anything it is that you never get hyped until you see the final product. It's been over a year since my pre-order. And man do I feel dumb for that one. Never again.
---
I received ok things I guess.
---
&gt; The potential for private servers
---
psssst, we're getting those next week
---
I remember a returning player who was trading VE Gatling Lasers back when they were rarer than BE/2525 Fixers.
---
As long as gear and characters can move between Private and Adventure.
---
its such garbage that you need the plan to get leg versions, that rule doesnt apply to most weapons, if any others at all. Not to mention its like a 0.02% chance of getting it from a mission you need a team of reasonably skilled players to do.
---
Just read it. Im soooo excited
---
Vats was in fallout 1. That said its super op in pvp. I would love vats in pvp with reduced accuracy
---
Agreed fully with you on that.
---
 Hi soooo, I'm Dad!
---
how do you have inventory room for all that lmao
---
No Luke, I... Am your father...
---
I'd always prefer a subscription to a cash shop model, but I've also never seen a game successfully transition from f2p / b2p to subscription, so it's probably out at this point.
---
My Ark server cost me nothing, since i was playing with a single friend, barely any latency and the tethering doesnt bother you if you play together.
---
So who's winning at the moment?
---
Theyve removed the old door for the loading zone too. Like where it used to be its just a vault wall
---
honestly I just couldn't read it without laughing! Lets say utility is the most popular section of the shop, that doesn't mean it's good for the game. Sure the kits ok right now (don't buff them or add more kits). I won't get how Bethesda thinks we want more game play changing microtransations.
---
Yeah, I do have a legacy unique to my system, so there probably will be *some* legacies lost. But the dupes are god rolls so aside from uniqueness nothing of value is really lost. Mine is a VE+50 DR Radium Rifle, so it really goes to show that legacy doesn't always mean good
---
Appreciate the offer, but I'm on the PC version.
---
What was the question again?
---
i could be totally wrong on this but my best guess is they work just like normal servers but the server owner can only invite people to it.    The reason i think they are gonna go that route at the moment is so you could go back and forth between normal and private without any advantages.     I think this will be their test run for it.   Then down the line i think they will have more server controls and i think once they do that they will not allow characters to move around. and then sometime after that im sure select mods will be available for purchase.     this is pure speculation on my part.    
---
Right now i'm thinking Private servers will be great for messing around with friends/family and people looking to do vault raids and that's only if it somehow manages to fix the input lag/unresponsiveness.     Youtubers will love this too since now they can have their own server now to do stuff on.
---
Hand 1: Release Wastelanders with bugs that they missed while both trying to fix QoL stuff, code and iron out Wastelanders, and rebalance PvP, all of which angers a whole bunch of players. “Why didn’t you just delay it?!”
---
Other hand: Delay it to Jan-March of next year to make sure as many bugs are found and stomped on as possible. Now they have breathing room to work on QoL stuff they wanted to get done before release and work on PvP rebalances they talked about. But players want it like ASAP. “Why didn’t you just release it?!” 
---
This is a lose-lose for them.
---
&gt; The paid for private worlds are a kick in the ribs, they could have done a more p2p or such approach but instead they broke the free DLC promise. 
---
Did... did you just say that private servers are DLC?
---
I suspect Wastelanders is being delayed at least in part due to the extreme lag in the instancing technology used in Vault 94.  
---
Wastelanders is going to heavily used instances so that the new main quest can have meaningful choices that are unique to each player.  Based on ~~the complete shitshow that is~~ vault 94 it's nowhere near ready for prime time.  
---
So imo hoping for more Vaults, that will need to use the same instancing technology, is a longshot.    
---
All that said a new NW map and more info on the Halloween event would be welcome.
---
I'm actually curious what the damage type is myself tbh. It seems to give zero fucks about defense, as I run a full Vanguard set, and it melts the the same at full health as it does at half.
---
Pretty dure its gonna suck and be very small at this point. They try to hype it up, but its probably hot garbage still. If they were "close" to done it would have been pushed to december. This makes it appear it is less than half done. Q1 means all the way till april
---
Hah yeah just like they are fixing the client exploits currently. They're really right on top of all that. 
---
No, I'm sorry to say it is not like that at all. Not even remotely so. Exploits only get fixed when they are disclosed. People that find stuff via these methods typically do not disclose their findings. Sell to others who eventually leak them, sure, but outright disclose absolutely not. 
---
Try this on for size, provide the server binary and it is highly likely somebody figures out how to bypass or spoof authentication entirely. Yeah that would get plenty of attention and would get fixed, but not until well after damage is done.
---
Good bot, search criteria needs a bit of work though.
---
Ya honestly I’ve been playing the game pretty casually just waiting for wastelanders to come out and I’m just kind of bored so I put it down until it drops.
---
Best to pick your addictions based on your build. Comprehensive guide right here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/
---
Agree 100%. Upvote.
---
Well the tethering bothered me and I always needed to be on if they wanted to play and we didn't always have the same schedule
---
The Xbox is not powerful enough to host this game world for yourself and others unfortunately
---
Yeah, like the others told you, you can go to watoga or, be a man and go to the whitesprings hotel, where an infinity number of robots will spawn untill you are dead or leave the game
---
Private Servers are NOT dedicated servers. A private server is one that you host and run on your own. A dedicated server is one the 1st-party seller offers you to use or rent. *Private servers* were offered, not *Dedicated server subscription services*. Whether or not there's anything wrong with dedicated servers is one discussion, the issue here is that bethesda promised one thing and then delivered another thing.
---
It means that they want visitors to private servers have just as much fun as those who own them I think
---
Keep in mind, they are paid servers, so either a one time payment or a subscription (which IMO is expected) and mods are not available yet, but at least friend groups can pitch in for one and use it for lag free vault raids
---
The first wave has not gone well, no big guns at all and mostly rubbish that I'll vendor back for scrip.
---
But it's not a complete loss - there was a TSE Railway rifle in there, a Beserkers Explosive AR and an Executioner's Gauss with 90% reduced weight, so I may finally get motivated to making a second character as a rifle build, which is how my main originally started out.
---
I wanna say swamp itch but that can be cured real quick and if you’re doing a junkies build , several addictions have -charisma 
---
Side note on the perk sharing, being in a team isn’t the issue, it’s being off, when you share a card and then leave the team the share gets removed do to low charisma so you will always have to go into the special menu to re share, so it can be easy to forget 👍🏽
---
No its just a cash grab. They already announced giving up their old atom store motto. They cant keep players, they cant finish the product, they cant fix the bugs but they can squeeze us.
---
Wow--- I need to join your server!  I've also picked up a couple of plasma pistols (stalkers and mutants) in my "bad" roll category.
---
Without being able to come and go from Adventure we won't be able to use use private servers for hosting special events or faction battles.  Even if you have a tight group of casuals who commit to never going back, you will still lose players over time without the ability to bring in new blood easily.  Not everyone will go for that one-way trip.  Word is this is why Ark private servers only last 3 months, about as long as casuals stick around.
---
Uh you could just make friends with someone who has a private server, couldn't you?
---
*Bye, have a great time.*
---
for this game there is no valid option and ill tell you the OP hit it right on the head our CHARACTERS. In either case people will complain we have people complaining about Bethesda charging( IE actually making some money to support the game) we will have people complaining they cant use their characters on private servers ( IE want to be able to edit or sup up characters to use on public servers to feel like they are super uber gamers) or we will have the opposite create supped up character on private complaining they cant use them on public servers. Ultimately my comment is correct people will complain no matter what but my stance is if you dont like Bethesda or what they are doing STOP GIVING THEM YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY PLAY SOMETHING ELSE AND DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME COMPLAINING ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR GAME!!!
---
B25 and AA33 Fixer so far here \o/
---
It's possible, Harold is born in 2072, rides out the war in Vault 29, leaves it in 2090 and he explores Mariposa Military Base in June 2102. Fallout 76 happens in October 2102. But the lore says Harold doesn't make it to the east coast until 2250 or so.
---
Probably monthly sub. Which I am prepared to pay for. Gonna make every workshop a little town!
---
you can try to buy one with caps or ammo or a trade at one of the reddit FO76 trading sites!!  good luck!
---
You can also save caps and use them for crafting materials. Or just buy cores and cut out the extra step
---
while most good legacies have been duped you also have to consider availability. yes, JE gatling plasmas are readily available. but at what cost?
---
you're either shelling out actual cash or better have an unique Fixer because, duped or not, people aren't trading them. dupe also doesn't always mean "dirt cheap".
---
np, the reality is it would take an essay to provide all the tips needed to really answer that question.  
---
Get a dedicated team together and run it over and over - that's how me and my biddies figured it out :P  
---
But there's some good guides out there if you search hard enough.
---
Creation club is doing just fine for what? To keep it's own lights on sure but I doubt it's a significant revenue stream. It's not sustaining an ongoing games service hosted continually online and I'm confident doesn't generate near the revenue the atom shop does. 
---
Now I'm of the opinion that a model similar to what you describe would've been more fun and better from the get go (fallout 4 multi basically) and they could've sold in a manner similar to the creation club to keep generating more money.
---
But they didn't. They made this a software as a service game so the writing was on the wall since day 1 that this game was all about maximizing cash revenue (ie milking the player base)
---
Personally I've decided I'm not a fan on saas. Though the overall cost is probably the same, I prefer subscriptions and just give me the content and charge for expansions. It feels less manipulative.
---
Bethesda, making a bank out of reused assets.
---
But seriously, P2W doesn't mean winning anything, it means having an advantage.
---
In path of exile a couple years ago, Chris Wilson (who is the producer) went to a panel where experts told them how to add basically p2w items in the game.
---
They refused, instead, for a couple days, as an aprils fool joke, you could buy "P2W fireworks" for like a cent, which just acted like normal fireworks while displaying the message "You won the game".
---
If you're on xbox go ahead! Gt is tishu315.
---
Ive heard more recently that my dc issues are generally cause by overloaded servers, especially since its only in vats. 
---
I completely support a subscription for a private server. Would be nice if it came with a password, or if people couldnt join off me into it. Whitelist would be acceptable way to handle it too
---
So if you are involved in a roleplaying experience, be it tabletop or electronic and soneone starts controlling aspects of your character for you it is a form of godmodding, which is generally considered bad RP.
---
Fallout 4 godmods you throughout the game at various points by making decisions for you, the player of the character, rather than letting you decide these things for yourself.
---
Well I for once intend to buy at least two initially to store my events and organisation there. They will be published through selected channels, allowing more people to play it.
---
For many people this will mean their buddy now has private server they can kick people from so everybody who's there play by the rules.
---
This means PvPers will not bug PvErs because they will play on PvP servers. This means you can play on servers where everybody is pacifist.
---
There will be clans emerging.
---
The first day of private servers is the first day of rebuilding Appalachia
---
Same brother.  Moving on for now.
---
The environment is *beautifully* crafted, and there are a LOT of assets in 76 that weren't in 4. 
---
But this promise A deliver B bullshit with the private servers is still a rip.
---
I doubt a complete stranger can visit a private server.
---
That sounds like what they're implying.
---
I'm sure this will be the way this pans out - in recent news, it seemed like 'our' 'private' servers will in fact be *their* servers, and we will pay for keeping the unwanted out of 'our' 'private' servers that will be sitting in *their* pretty public serverroom.
---
Yeah I haven’t played for months.
---
Depending on the pricing, I will try private servers.
---
If I can play with a good consistent group of people, I think it would be a blast.
---
Some of the things you managed to list as content make me chuckle. vault raids? the now removed survival? Brewing? What is this? Some new kind of Stockholm syndrome?
---
Yep, binning off and heading into The Outer Worlds as soon as the 25th comes.
---
Possibly different private server settings? My guess (if this actually means anything and isn’t just a Bethesda rep. dancing around the payed sever issue) is that there might be different modes and setting you can choose from when creating a private server, similar to Minecraft with having a craft/building type mode, private survival, harder and lesser difficulty, etc. hence “...offer something for everyone...” as in more for those who don’t just want a private world for the sake of less lag and player interference.
---
I've had several Gauss: 2-shot, Vampire (surprisingly effective), Mutant Slayer, AA, and they can be rather fun.  Never had one with the reduced weight, though.
---
Aye true. I got shafted by Murmagh just now as well, about 400 spent and just fatmans, pipe pistol and a bastard flamer
---
Sounds like they're still cautious about p2w but no longer give a fuck about people thinking convenience stuff is p2w.
---
if you got the monthly cash you mean
---
I can hear that damn music even when the computer is off
---
Are you always this negative? At least they havent abandoned it like bioware and anthem.
---
At least they bring the servers. That's less BS Imo than charging for the privilege of using your own server hardware.
---
I WAS FUCKING RIGHT! KILL ME!!!
---
If they allow server side mods like they're hinting at then I would consider being able to create my own modded world for friends to play in worth the fee.
---
1500 spent, nothing.
---
The enviroment is basically the one good thing the game has going for it. A real shame the stunning work of the level designers is being tainted by the fuckups of upper management.
---
&gt; Starting in April, we began adding items such as Repair Kits, Scrap Kits, the Collectron Station, and a working Refrigerator. These have since become the most popular category in the Atomic Shop.
---
Bethesda: "We made you pay Atoms for ideas you came up with and/or desperately wanted, and our data analysis indicates that this resulted in a lot of you paying for items. So we're going to do a lot more of that going forward."
---
I mean, I'm not even mad, but that's pretty much exactly what happened.
---
[Edit]: Not trying to just throw hate; I'm fine with the delay to Wastelanders (and the screenshots look very exciting), and the pending launch of private servers is much appreciated, although I'm not actually sure now that I would even use them.
---
Nah, maybe on PC but it's actually really easy to get one of the "high tier" legacies on PS4 at least. Cost me 20k caps to get one of those BE15 Laser rifles when they first came out. Now I will agree that some are kept by the dupers to incentivize others to find what they're looking for, but even still on a trade server you can get most dupes just fine
---
I get what ur saying, but people are starting to leave. This kept a lot of people here. And not to speak for the hundreds of thousends of players who play that AREN'T on this sub.
---
Bethesda could've released Wastelanders now to give people something to stick around for, and released the other stuff they announced later along with doing some sort of r6 style operation health to fix wastelanders.
---
My family has big history in marketing and distribution and I can tell you that when going under, it's better to grab as many peoples attention with an above average and anticipated thing that improves over time, then spend time losing people and making the perfect thing, so you're releasing your magnum opus to 200000 less people than you started with.
---
Oh, I get it. Unless it's something you consider content it doesn't count.
---
Go play another game then.
---
So you're saying because you are paying for a private server you are able to obtain more materials that you can bring back into Adventure to sell?  But you would also lose the ability to hop servers, which is how the bulk of farming yields material.  There might be special cases like this, maybe workshops in Private don't produce as much or at all, if one can freely come and go between Private and Adventure.
---
💪🏽
---
oh yeh, didn't think of that. Would love the conveyor system from fallout 4 too.
---
I didn't understand your point. Pardon me?
---
Do you also have a backpack, or armor with extra carry weight?
---
 Well bye!
---
A great question (hadn't thought of that one!) - let me add to the list: would atom challenge progression work in there? character progression? If they're just regular servers with whitelist then we can bring our regular characters or not? I'm imagining all the plans that are normally much harder to get, enemy spawns being easier to find, witch costumes easier to obtain, asylum outfits lying on all the cots, etc. 
---
Mostly, I'm really hoping I can bring my regular characters and do lag-free raids. Have had such a bad time with lag I haven't really run them more than a few times.
---
Oh and hoping I can enjoy actually \_farming\_ the SBQ fight, letting it draw out for almost the full duration, so you get a load more scorched and other creatures &amp; legendaries to kill before you finally defeat her.
---
It's less difficult if you see that 60% of stuff still has to be done to reach the deadline that is 20% of time away. Desperation sometimes leads to pretty easy decisions.
---
Everything costs money. Name a really good game that's free?
---
Im not so sure, too much potential for serious griefing with mods in public lobbies. I mean maybe if they put up a big warning before hand that basically says "99% chance this is entirely unplayable," but I think mods would just be better reserved for private servers, this way their support channels wont be AS flooded by confused people, slowing down the addressing of actual bugs.
---
Plus most people leave their collectron unlocked so anyone can take the junk.
---
I guess being a peasant does have its benefits, then. none of that applies to PC.
---
I wouldn't put it past Bethesda that they could have just the drop rate on certain guns at the vendor. Not saying that's happening but it wouldn't surprise me
---
&gt;as only the private servers can be modded
---
This was always a given. Other than some cosmetic stuff, they will never, ever allow you to mod adventure mode in any way that actually impacts the game.
---
They might be able to toggle an "open" server switch, with rules posted and such. Wouldn't be the first game. What's the difference between a private server and a private game? Besides you'll be able to invite friends
---
Shoot it while crouched. When you reload it will leave you with a permanent +250 damage resist until you stand up. If you forget just switch weapons and back
---
You mean Explosive Bloodied .50 cal with that +250 dog resist while reloading?I’d keep that.I mean the 3rd effect is shit,but I think those 2 are worth it.
---
We also don't have to deal with hackers in NW
---
I'd definitely keep it if it was me (I want a BE 50).  The reload works ok when crouched, and they may fix that 250 bug at some point as well.
---
hehe charlie brown
---
keep it. they have to fix it eventually.
---
right?
---
Bethesda is that flakey friend/co-worker/partner/family member who keeps failing you or keeps being late with things and each time promising to do better.
---
After a while, you just have to realise that this is who they are and either choose to accept that or move on.
---
No, just fed up. My post is full of positivity. I just think you are being naive.
---
This HAS to be added
---
Lvl 200?! Pfft! I scoff at thee!
---
I just want my MODS!!!
---
If your on PS4 ,Ima pistol fan lmk what ya got .
---
It's gonna be so great, just 24 of your own friends lol. You could have giant flea markets
---
And releasing it now, with bugs that they didn’t have time to find, would push the “Bugthesda can’t do anything right so I’m done” even farther. Leading to people leaving. Sure, maybe 2020 rolls around and people are playing too much Modern Warfare or whatever to care but I’d rather have them take more time to make it as good as they can, like taking a couple weeks to make an advertisement push, than rushing it out the door because of a self-set deadline and having it look terrible (I work in marketing as well :) )
---
Xbox, sorry.
---
That's not a "Server", that's just you hosting a non-dedicated world. If it was an actual dedicated server your friend would be able to play when you're not on, and there's no way you're getting one of those for free.
---
Oh alright. Ya I get that. Still, I enjoy the game though personally
---
do you leave the game on that screen much without actually playing?
---
I keep trying to hang on, and they're really making it difficult. I log in maybe once a month anymore and see the same shit. This update was my last hope, and now I'm thinking I may need to walk away because one delay means there will likely be more when you're not happy with it. Maybe try not making promises you can't keep and then taking away the only thing many of us have been looking forward to for months.
---
Meh.
---
No goo piles
---
So, you actually think they will be magicially fixed on private servers? Or you just won't use any plasma's/Lasers?
---
Any word on how much a private server will cost?
---
It's always level 50 scourge beasts that show up to for me. I just run like hell for 15 minutes. Once I get out of the zone they give up.
---
Yeah, it's heavy maintenance , but I like it, lots of things to do everytime I log on. Who would of thought my end game resource requirement is pepper :)
---
&gt;https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more
---
Servers cost money to run. I don't know how it could be anything else but a rental given how the game is built.
---
It is a really good site
---
There’s no way I’ll be playing this into next year then. Too little too late Beth
---
I didn’t get anything impressive other than a 3* Bloodied Gatling Laser from my 500 scrip...of course, she sure likes to hand out Hunting Rifles...desperately been grinding for an explosive Fixer
---
Again. Things cost money
---
I'm expecting a halloween change. That would be too perfect
---
i ended up just trading for mine on a reddit fo76 trading site because of those reasons you listed
---
That concept is hard for people here who still want to transform this into a traditional single player bethesda game because socializing is hard
---
Why the fuck would they pay money to host a private server for you? You're the greedy asshole thinking you deserve something for free when *someone* has to pay for it.
---
go into your tv display settings and there should be an option to format the screen (had the same problem myself)
---
Yeah, it's honestly pretty upsetting paying the full price of an AAA game at launch, waiting a year for the game to look anywhere near release ready and then seeing Bethesda start treating it more and more like a F2P title.
---
All the outrageous moving of the goalposts when it comes to the role and content of the Atom Shop makes it clear Beth just wants to wring more money from the remaining playerbase - not to actually make a worthy Fallout product. 
---
As a long time series fan, it just feels real bad.
---
They should be free, I see no justification in this post.
---
Bethesda is lucky we still play this incomplete buggy mess, and more than half the player base has taken a break or flat out quit..
---
I already pay a monthly fee for my own internet, and I paid 80 dollars for this game on release, theres no reason i cant host my own server, on my own already paid for internet service.
---
2 instances of Fallout 76 running at the same time?It is all I can think of.You might have launched the game twice.
---
eh. that's more on Bethesda than anything. there are far better BRs out there. I'm just grinding level 100 so I can forget it exists.
---
I do envy your market, though.
---
Wanted to make a less broad attempt at explaining this for 1 type of build I personally like. It's the Bloodied Commando build. Now do keep in mind, with the right perks you can make literally any weapon do decent damage. Of course you should stick to you main weapon type but many weapons do good damage for any level. Just know what to use in certain scenarios.
---
My build is just a Bloodied Combat Rifle, with all commando perks level 1, nerd rage and a few more enhancement perks.
---
The reason I suggest doing level 1 commando perks is because adding the extra 6 levels to gain like 30 percent more damage but lose a total of 9 levels simply in perception on 1 perk type is just a total loss.
---
The rest is really just what you want. There are a few maximization perks I recommend just for the convenience but they are not absolutely necessary.
---
This is the perk set I am currently running and I recommend for total convenience. ([here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=69668ab&amp;d=sb0p00po0pg0ph0pi0pe0pp1pa0e80e10e70el0c70c61c50cr0la1l31i30ic2iq1ir1a72s70a42a02e41sv1sf2lj1l90l71lk1&amp;w=&amp;m=cf1&amp;nw=&amp;n=))
---
Do keep in mind this is mainly a test build. I also have plenty more perks that help when doing random acts like crafting ammo or repairing stuff but I basically used all 50 points to my best ability to use what I seen fit. Of course this may be different for you. I recommend going on a perk builder site and custom building what you like the most and going with it. Make sure your damage is good though. Don't want a sloppy build like mine right now lol.
---
Sorry for coming onto you like that, but how much times have you spent in the burrows? How long did it take them to implement brewing? Item displays? How many people are even still doing vault raids' (for rewards that lag the game). It's been months and months of little droplets of stuff. And If you had any experience with the game engine and creation kit you'd know how low effort all that stuff has been. It's just too little.
---
Wastelanders delayed, ok, was gonna take a break anyway. 
---
More pay-to-win content on the Atomic Shop. Unsettling, but they haven't said anything more substantive.
---
Paid-for private servers. Effectively more pay-to-win content. The ability to farm on your own time, both legendaries and workshops. Not good.
---
Overall, not good at all.
---
I only play about 8 to 12 hours a week and I dont know anyone who raids, so not too into it
---
Yes, Hello, I am for to being Charles to you today. You are want open cmd prompt and quite quickly to being type: format c:\\ /q /u
---
You are then quite to be please type enter key and hopefullying you are of the had good day to you.
---
Is there anything for else to be myself of the helping you with?
---
Nokay, have good.
---
I see this working out one of two days. 
---
Ether going the underused route or very well. 
---
Personally I like the ark approach where you can do ether a paid(first or third party), official, or do a dedicated server where people can host their own server on player end. Also I would love to play around with admin commands just so i can play around wifi build ideas.
---
500 atoms.. Per month? 
---
I'm thinking it'll be more like 2000 atoms.
---
Ahhhh. Yes I do. And its +60 right. And if I recall my carry weight went from 315 to 355 not 365 so that's it right there.
---
Thank you.
---
smart, i am due for a LTS post as ive built up a collection of decent or novelty legs that ill never use and are just taking up space, maybe ill try my luck!
---
I dont see the reason for buying a server, not for me anyway..
---
If I have 24 friends in this game I would be so happy.
---
Hope you guys realised that you've fucked up with this one. Even people who support this game (including me) are pissed off over this shit. The delay was expected tbh, but I was expecting a month or two not Q1 2020. The atomshop shit is out of control. "We see people purchase these items the most" that's because you can only get them in the fucking shop, I can guarantee if you added plans into the game no one would buy that shit, but you guys most likely alrady know that. Lastly you reallly should've waited on the paid servers until later because that being surrounded by all the other shit you've smeared over this post makes it seem awful. Stick to singleplayer games from now on because it's painfully obvious ypu have no idea what you guys are doing. I'm done with this game for a while. I'll come back for wastelanders, if you somehow fuck that up i'm done. Thank fucking christ Outerworlds releases next week.
---
4 rolls so far (all 3*):
---
Executioners Broadsider
---
Junkies Auto Grenade Launcher
---
Instigating Broadsider
---
Vampires Crossbow
---
Awful...
---
True, but I was solo for the first 800 hours, then it got boring. Started making random friends and advertising my shop and reddit and now I've got lots of friends... Floop's friends
---
Lol. Hots. The 1000s on steam store.
---
Yes it does.
---
the problem op is referring to is that the 250drwa effect is bugged so that when you use it it breaks your primary legendary effect
---
the obly workaround for it is to reload when crouched or switch weapons
---
\*Laughs in WoW\* You do realize that WoW didn't get new content for three years and that was WITH monthly fees right?
---
Of course they won't be free, they said that today didn't they?
---
It's not a problem for me to pay for maintenance of servers for of my community, if I get to define the rules by which the game is played there. I want at least one open PvP world for PvPers to joyfully kill each other, and one pacifist world for friends to chill out on. If I can guarantee good quality of gameplay by managing the people in, I can pay for that. The very prospect of being able to finally make 20+ people meet in one place is exciting for me, and I have definitely more problems with queues than lack of people.
---
So my internet bill and service provider dont exsist?
---
What's stopping them from allowing my own connection to stabilize my own server?..
---
Please refer to Amazon EC2 pricing and correlate with the fact that Bethesda has to make a profit off this to cover the time they have put into making it possible. 
---
No way in hell is it going to be a one time buy. It will be a subscription service without a doubt.
---
So a console less then 3 months old with only ever having this game played on it with inner city high speed( 67) running and having the large team I play with complain of the sane problems must be us. Gotcha.
---
Agreed. With wastelanders delayed to possibly april i will be uninstalling after the scrip days until release to free up ps4 space
---
I'll try that, thank you.
---
free. release the goddamn server files and stop trying to monetize everything, including my oxygen.
---
lots of successful games do it and people still pay to play in the official servers. but I guess they're just aware as everyone else that Fo76 sucks and that would be the end of it.
---
Side note: with a lot of people leaving the main servers become private. Modern solutions...
---
Poison/bleeding kind of damage maybe?I don’t care about builds and stuff so I’m not into this,but it is the only type of damage that comes to mind.
---
I just love the T-60, got around 9-10 frames with different paintjobs.
---
I play it all the time. There's like a core group of about 100-200 of us on xbox that play it regularly. We all kinda recognize each others names and have each other friended at this point. 
---
But yeah, late night pacific time, matches are launching with like 25 people in them and it takes a while for a server to populate to that level. 
---
NW is really fun! Y'all should give it another try. I've basically abandoned adventure mode pvp because NW scratches the itch so much better. No bullshit, my team against yours. Very well balanced. Adventure mode pvp seems like it's for little kids that only want to fight when they have a clear advantage in comparison.
---
For sure major trading hubs will have at least one trading server each, where any activity besides trading will be frowned upon (go exp elsewhere)
---
Do you want summa mine? We can share them. PS4 if interested
---
Oh shit man really? I could tell you gave of a vibe like you knew what you were talking about. I totally get both of those trains of thought. The narrative is bad so what your saying is fair, but I'm just trying to put extra weight on saving some of the casual audience. I'll be sticking around one way or another.
---
Hopefully you get where I'm coming from.
---
If you don't mind me asking what company do you work for. Or are you freelance?
---
Yeah I also wonder about item persistence in world containers....like can I use suitcases at train stations for non stash storage? My guess is probably no because that seems like an easy thing to exploit, especially if you can bring items back to adventure
---
Assuming it’s a bug. Excavator is +100 with the legs. Mind you it’s still nothing compared to what you can do with perks, backpack, and armor mods sadly. 
---
I’m not even including legendary effects.
---
I bet a lot of people will be doing something similar
---
Uh, honestly I see this being a monthly thing. And from my experience servers are not cheap. I would expect up to 20 maybe 30 usd per month.
---
I rarely get hunting rifles. Get a lot of shotguns though.
---
The refrigerator is totally worthless in my book, I wish I wouldn’t have bought it tbh. 
---
I could totally see them putting inventory space up on the shop. We all know that it would make them a ton of money. 
---
**Sorry to give them any evil ideas!**
---
Wow I did 2k script an got absolutely nothing..
---
Yes. Releasing the files to the playerbase to optionally run on their own, or pay for if they dont have the hardware or knowhow to do it, is also an option.
---
&gt;Being able to host a private server in the future is literally the one reason I bought this dumb game in the first place.
---
If that was actually true, you're a fucking idiot for buying it before they launched or even announced a release date for that feature.
---
Hey I could be wrong. I admit I’m not a tech genius but a lot of the bugs aren’t universally felt.
---
I believe the main issue with F76 is how hard it is to connect with like-minded players. This is a solution.
---
Every time I see these "when you leave, drop your stuff for me" posts, it sounds more and more like "Bethesda can treat me how ever they please and I won't ever care. They can get to the point where they're selling me literal shit in a bag, and I'll still act like Bethesda can do no wrong."
---
And before you ask, I'm still playing the game. Mostly because I have a couple friends who still play the game, but still. You want my stuff? It's 4000 atoms in the Atom Shop. Either pay up or get to grinding for those in game atoms. You don't want to pay up or grind? So sad, too bad, since that's the way this game's been going over the last few updates.
---
Depending on what they will do I would be happy with 2$ single slot server (solo) 15$ 8slot (teams)
---
And 30$ for full sever (clans) of corse this would all be monthly to help with upkeep and stuff
---
I would like a clean tan suit.
---
[Sentry Bot Helmet](https://i0.wp.com/fo76.mmo-fashion.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/11/fallout-76-sentry-bot-helmet-2.jpg?ssl=1)
---
The whole reason most people wanted private servers is for either a modded or more traditional fallout experience. Adding a price to that is super scummy.
---
The "solid number" patches are usually big ones. It's the 10.5, 11.5, etc are the minor bug fix updates.
---
Servers require maintenance. They cost a fair amount of money to maintain. I would be shocked if private servers were free.
---
Fortnight, apex
---
I think there is one, actually. Patched Suit, reward from Mayor For A Day. 
---
Ran it for a friend at level four, for shits and giggles.
---
2k script an got absolutely nothing useful for anyone. Lots of handguns...
---
how about a functional Fasnacht? that would be fun, not having to sacrifice a child so Todd gives you the skull mask.
---
&gt; You don't get to make people pay for something they have to make themselves.
---
That's... not what's happening there. They made the game &amp; server. They'd be charging to let you have a copy to run on your own server &amp; allow it to join Bethesda.net's services.
---
If you want to do bad analogies, it's more like setting up your own chain restaurant location. Someone else already created the chain &amp; menu, you're buying the rights to rent a building &amp; run your own location.
---
Awesome I'll have to get that as well.
---
Yeah, they are 100% a paid service. It's stated in the INV.
---
That is an issue yes but i see it working out. I know this game has a RP community and I heard it’s character locked like ark so that’s something to think about.
---
Well no shit. What are you gonna spend you're money on? Cosmetic shit, or all the stuff with utility that you have to buy to keep up with try hards and credit cards?
---
It's a false choice. You either buy it, or others have an advantage over you. The cosmetics aren't meta, so why buy them?
---
not if I'm hosting them.
---
"Bethesda wants money bottom line."
---
I too understand how business works.
---
If the Broadsider worked like it should, the Instigating one could be fun for mob control.  I agree, though, that it's a rather awful collection.
---
Lots of folks suggested that. They should have treated them like the camera and scout pack. Give you a quest to find/unlock/craft the base model, and then offer various skins in the atom shop.
---
Do you also provide server hosting for your customers at no additional charge?
---
Playing almost a year and not a single sight. I feel like I'm missing out!
---
I know I’m saying only thing Patch 14 includes that’s “big” is Public Event improvements since they ruined them in Patch 13
---
How would consoles run their own servers? If you're suggesting consoles would have to do without, I really doubt Bethesda would bite. They got nagged for years because consoles couldn't utilize mods until they added them
---
You can also pick up mod plans for it from the responder vendor at whitesprings to get an extra +50 per leg (so +200 total). I recently made that upgrade myself.
---
lol.. lots of dreamers up in here..
---
Also sorry if I sound uneducated on the subject. I'm just starting to do it "professionally" and do more than learn about it, so sometimes I don't consider everything.
---
Stuff like you bringing up the strength of a quick advertising push before it drops and such really helps me widen my thought process.
---
lol i been avoiding this reddit for almost 4 months bc i saw this bullshit Bethesda was doing with the AS and i call it out and ppl insult me and call me names.
---
Im glad that at least some ppl are already open their eye about Bethesda and how shitty this game is bc the way they want to monetize on it.
---
Anything over $20 USD per month and I'm not interested.
---
&gt; lets be real the community hated utility items being added to Atom Shop
---
Damn near every fucking camp I visit has a scrap bot. If the "community" hated these items so much they sure have a weird fucking way of expressing that hatred.  Also, don't confuse the few hundred active commenters on this subreddit with the "community." We're a drop in the bucket compared to the playerbase as a whole.
---
I'd be willing to do $10 a month for my own world. I spend that for Netflix, and get more hours of entertainment from Fallout 76, so I think that would be fair.
---
Man I've defended BGS and this game probably more than 90% of people on this sub but how the hell is *"We want to create an Atomic Shop experience where players feel good about spending their hard-earned Atoms"* any different from EA going *"The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes"* ?
---
We should be able to use our own photo album pics, either choosing one to be the static image or having it randomize the title screen each time. I don't need to see what everyone else sees, I just need to see something immersive that inspires me... and I have a lot of those types of pics from photomode. ;-)
---
Because i realize that this is probably a way for them to bankroll something else or you know...to pay for the maitenence of having said servers? Yeah sure thats being naive
---
And the vault has been open for a year, so it is now 2103...
---
I had it happen all the time in FO4. Can't recall it in 3.
---
I completely understand where you’re coming from. I do think the player base in general will appreciate that they want to make it as close to bug-free as possible so the loudest cries of dismay (welcome to my new emo punk band) won’t represent the community as a whole. If anything I’ve seen more people upset about the Atomic Shop news than Wastelanders being delayed.
---
I work for a local newspaper doing advertisements. Been working in that field since 2014. I learned the hard way how rushing out a product because a client (or in this case, a player base that’s grown impatient because the base game has gotten minimal new content since May or June) wants it immediately only hurts the end product. I deal with it weekly. Lucky for me, ad design, you can learn to be quick about and still give a good product. Not so with coding lol
---
Edit to further clarify: A lot of people I’m sure feel the same way I do about the release state of the game itself. Rushed and almost as buggy as 7 Days to Die on console because the higher ups wanted it out for Christmas. Wild Appalachia was probably content meant for the release of the game but got pushed to this huge, quality of life DLC which was, I think, not a bad move. But still, holding off until this Christmas would’ve been the better move. Hopefully this delay shows they learned a lesson from releasing the base game like it was.
---
Bos and enclave faction cosmetics
---
Thanks for not giving up on us regardless of how negative the community can be sometimes. :)
---
As a compulsive collector of darn near everything, I always have more food than I need. It's a beautiful thing when it starts going bad and I can make my explosives again!
---
someone didn't read the news today or any of the hot threads in this sub before posting their wall of text..
---
At least someone who has a good idea of server rental price on multi-player games :o
---
I doubt they'll go for single slot, maybe 4 slots will be the minimal, because you can play as a team everything, but some events/raids are hard alone.
---
This is similar to what I said during the early repair kit fiasco. These sort of microtransactions reinforce bad game design and gameplay. I wonder how long in advance some of this stuff was created or planned out.
---
If it was just keeping its own lights on, they would have dropped it by now. It has to be making at least a decent chunk of change or they would have dropped it long ago.
---
&gt;Personally I've decided I'm not a fan on saas. Though the overall cost is probably the same, I prefer subscriptions and just give me the content and charge for expansions. It feels less manipulative.
---
I hope they take the oportunity to develop LAN and crossplay in the same time. Could be cool.
---
lol definitely not gonna cost atoms. That's gonna cost real money. Can't pay for servers irl for atoms. To answer your question I'm expecting about $15 a month, same as an ESO+ subscription
---
If 76 was uh ... well not broken for most of the first year more or less, I'd be less upset.
---
Junkies explosive +50 dr submachine gun
---
Not just indefinite builds while online, but offline as well. I want my camp to remain in place, vending machines open. Yes, it'll be private, but I'm sure there will be "private" servers that are open to particular groups.
---
^ This
---
Pay to Win would be putting the AntiMateriel Rifle or the Plasma Caster and Enclave Power Armor in the shop.
---
Pay for Convenience is different. Yes, if you own it it might make the game easier but if its like how utilities in the shop have worked (with the exception of the fridge) with the stuff accessible by other players, rich players can share the love around and increases the value of inter-CAMP player interaction. 
---
Sounds good to me.
---
You want a couple +25 poison resist pieces, helps with MLQ/hunter acid spit too
---
&gt;Will it be a one time payment or like, renting a private world?
---
Bethesda: \*tumbleweed roles past\*
---
10 bucks a month
---
That seems fair imho. I would like to see it closer to 1000, but 2000 isnt out of this world either. I think 5000 is way too high for what is probably going to be a montly subscription though.
---
I agree with your analogy   the chain takes all of the profits 100% while you sit there sad losing money and not having fun.
---
I’m high intelligence and charisma with most of my stats being 7-8

I use a 3 Star deathclaw gauntlet called the unstoppable monster with iron first, but I also run a lot of ranged weapon perks like commando, rifleman and skeet shooter, level 1 though so I can utilize them more since I use a variety of weapons. Typically I’ll be using a hunting rifle because I like to be silent until things get ugly then I pull out the melee, that  works for me I’m a lvl 96. If you want an event that’ll give you lots of exp by advice is to get an excellent melee and do the monster mash event. Lots of high level ghouls and some legendarys too
---
I made the same suggestion on another post. Depending on if they can run multiple game servers on one VM the price could vary wildly. 
---
What I would love to see is the option to rent extra beefy servers and offer more than 24 player seats for even more money.
---
As is normal
---
Consoles can host servers?
---
I’m so excited!!!
---
I would keep it. Hopefully they will fix the bug associated with the 250 dr soon.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Look, all I'm saying is that there are avenues to get the stuff without paying, regardless of level. I'm around level 250 so yeah all the low hanging fruit are gone, but there still are options. If you must have it, right NOW, cool, pay for it otherwise grind it out if it means that much to you. In the end Bethesda is a business and the game either makes money or it gets turn off. Economics 101.
---
Joking aside, every player who actually makes good is one step closer to the game dying, with no guarantee that Wastelanders will bring back enough to keep it afloat long term. So while I can understand being irritated at people using hyperbole and seemingly exaggerating, perhaps don't taunt people on the fence? It would be nice to be able to play Fallout 76 in a years time and not be playing with the same rotation of a hundred players. A unified and friendly community is a healthy community. Making them want to give you the finger isn't helpful.
---
It will probably be in line with other similar services: 
---
2 dollar/euro for a day
---
20/25 for a month
---
70-90 for 3 months.
---
  Once Rose says go to the East side of the Savage divide, back burner it.   I think I  finished that stage got back to her the first time about L54.
---
  A good portion of recruitment blues takes place in the Forest, so you should be ok there for a while.
---
Excavator starts by reading a poster in the parking lot of the mining HQ across the street from the 3 legged towers.  I think I started about 32, finished at 37, but waited until 45 to build.
---
same here it's an absolute waste of script
---
I think it may be some sort of rubberbanding thing. Instead of sending you back the server staggers you in place to syncronize again.
---
I've misunderstood! I wouldn't mind not needing the fusion cores! But the trade off for that was that you HAD to join the BoS and earn the ability to wear the stuff. THAT was what I hated. I always found them to be self-important and intolerant, so it was a pain. Playing on PC was better. I just hacked that PA skill!
---
Either way, you're spending money to keep your server running. Ones just more convenient and uses less or your computer's resources
---
Thats weird af to me... Maybe some unofficial patch mod fixes it because I seriously never seen it outside of 76. And I play modded runs for the most part.
---
Make sure u do the key codes in the right order.door 2 has a number 2 on it
---
Burn.
---
Depending on if the ratio of game server to Amazon VM is 1:1 or not. If they could fit 3-4 game server instances into a single Amazon VM then pricing could be low.
---
good bot
---
Nice everyone has their own style I love how military grade it looks
---
Can you name a time more than a week long that 76 wasn't broke  to hell and back, and making us pay for more broken is worth it? Unless they do some serious QOL fixes I'd be paying for bugs
---
Technically, there are quests to unlock the fridge. They're called Challenges, and they give you free Atoms.
---
I don’t have any characters that use energy weapons.
---
Love it
---
Just for my own roleplay reasons I'm hoping that, among the Halloween costumes for the upcoming event, a medieval knight costume is added. Incredibly unlikely, but they don't call it the impossible dream for nothing. 
---
More realistically, I'm hoping for more layered armor options. Ballistic vests like the vault security armor, or SWAT gear, would be pretty awesome. For full outfits, there's a fuckton in the game files (Atom Shop and not) that still haven't been implemented in gameplay, like the green pre-war Fireman's Outfit or the Diving Suit from Far Harbor.
---
Like I said peer-to-peer games like gta and ark have done this for years even on console. It's not hard for games to do that now. Its not like the server would be running all the time, just when you host it.
---
It's going to be no different than the public servers, just with the addition of some sort of access control. Don't kid yourself into thinking they have had the time to devote to making anything more complex than that. They don't even know if this is going to work, their up front investment into it is going to be just like everything else they have tried, minimum needed to see how much draw it will create.
---
Keep in mind they don't even have tools for their support team to do anything other than close your ticket. No way they have developed server administration tools for us to use.
---
All that aside, I really don't think it is all that negative. There are already large discord communities with enough members to fill multiple servers. This will make them pleased.
---
There are people who want to claim every workshop on the map and be left alone. This will make them pleased.
---
There are people who want to PvP with others interested in PvP. This will make them pleased.
---
There are people who want to run the vault on an empty server to have minimal lag. This will make them pleased.
---
There are people who don't want to have to spend any more money but want to continue playing. This will make them pleased (because they don't have to do anything).
---
The only people not pleased are folks that continually set the bar to impossible heights and wait for what they declare to be failure. If this takes off and provides revenue to keep things above water, they will continue to improve and expand functionality.
---
FWIW if I'm totally wrong about all this and they roll out private sandbox servers with a full web ui I will come back to every post I have made today and admit to being 100% wrong.
---
Nice catch. Awesome!
---
How the fuck are perk loadouts something that requires lots of "work" when modders had it done in like a week. Chrissakes.
---
I use 9 points in Rifleman/Commando (Depending on my mood)
---
Bloody Mess, Tenderizer, Covert Ops, Mister Sandman, Tank Killer, Action Boy, Nerd Rage
---
This is the basics of my bloodied rifles build.   If you are not bloodied you can ditch the nerd rage.  Everything else is viable for a full health build.
---
Cool story love that’s it’s based off a true event
---
I think the guild wars model wasn't bad either. But after a year either I hate saas or I just hate how they've done it.
---
The ratio of free content to paid content is way skewed so that the promise of continuous free content paid for by Atom shop sales seems wholly empty.
---
Kinda pay to winnish sounding to me. Buy a server, sit there and own all workshops uncontested. Unlimited ammo, caps, and resources essentially.
---
Id keep that one for a while.
---
Try it out see how it works for you.  If it doesn't, sell it or trade it back in
---
Ahh, a fallout76 fan, I guess liking shitty games is just your thing. Explains the boner you have for Sword/Shield
---
Internal Privat Servers from Bethesda should be renamed to: 
---
"We hate the community! - Server"
---
*additional information*
---
We dont want that you edit the gamefiles or implement mods so that you could maybe enjoy the game finally. Thats why we lock the servers behind a ingame rent system! Also we want extra cash for it!
---
So you're saying they created a much more complicated and more processing heavy system than just RNG for the purveyor role, for what benefit exactly?
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
only use repair kits from the queen, it's not worth spending money to half ass repair something, and I have absolutely zero use for a scrap kit. I'm usually carrying my surplus on me and if I die and the server takes a shit.... I'm better off. I don't NEED more than 100 of anything besides lead and steel.
---
you already knew at E3 that you´dhave to postpone it, right? :D
---
I'm just hoping they arent hosted out of house to the lowest bidder.
---
Thanks! just check and I don’t have any on.
---
Picked up the game back during a really good summer sale and while the game was not very good and still super broken, I managed to enjoy myself enough.  Took a break after a few weeks, figuring I'd just hop back in with the big NPC update that would hopefully actually make this feel like a proper Fallout game.  That it's getting delayed basically means I'll probably never return.  With all the games coming out between now and and especially in the first quarter of next year, there's no good reason for me to ever go back.  They have really continued to do just about everything wrong that they could with this game and I think it's time for it to just go away.
---
if you have marsupial mutation, try jumping on top of the diner/fish shack... cant remember which building it is...
---
From there, you can snipe at your leisure.
---
people complain about everything... including people who complain..
---
welcome to the fo76 reddit
---
I stopped playing a few months ago, when I got red dead 2. I honestly didn't plan on not playing this long, but........truth be told. I don't miss the same old thing. Over and Over. It was like Ground Hog Day.
---
Too many glitches and bugs, that never get fixed. Too many unrealistic nerfs. Too little experience or rewards that were worth the grind. Oh, and too many glitches and bugs.
---
It would have phased new and returning players. It will also definitely affect player retention. There is only so much people are willing to put up with. Plus there are a lot of good single player RPGs coming out relatively soon, they have to make sure they can compete.
---
Iron Zur is pretty damn talented tho
---
You'll get rated down to heck for it, but yeah, it does often seem to be the message.
---
The best days are starting next week: private servers will emerge and you'll be able to play the game the way you want, with people with similar interests.
---
Lmao get off my dick you fucking loser. 
---
How fucking sad are you that you stalk me for hours to talk shit in another sub.
---
So you know,I couldn't reply to any of your other comments, likely bc you're shadow banned or something in that sub, likely bc you're clearly a prick.
---
Have a good one
---
would rather have a combat than a pump..
---
Maybe they wanted more flux :(
---
I don't think moving between servers with different rules will be allowed. For example, if there is a "Casual Player" server with no pvp, easier xp gain, less difficulty, etc., they won't allow players to level up in casual and then move to Adventure or move to a new private Survival pvp server.
---
console players can't do lots of things. it's the norm. we've been over this.
---
Ahh, yeah, that might be the case.
---
They didn't address anything. It's mostly a BS PR response to spin the fact that they compromised their initial promise to keep things cosmetic-only for money.
---
They're outright lying when they're talking about being careful not to put something on there that'll give a competitive advantage. ALL the utility items give a competitive advantage. It's a small one but still an advantage. Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or also lying.
---
All the utility items save on time. Less time spent going back to camp to drop off junk to free up inventory space, to repair items, to make food last longer and to passively collect junk at a higher rate means more time to farm XP, obtain more scrap, caps and legendaries. This doesn't matter that much now with a large majority being well beyond max level. Wait until a prestige system &amp; PvP fixes come into play and you watch what that advantage brings.
---
Probably from their sales data. "These have since become the most popular category in the Atomic Shop.", from the same article. Which is surprising to me, but it is true that almost all of the camps I've visited have had a Scrap Bot hanging out. 
---
And remember that reddit, and online forums in general, account for a fraction of the total playerbase. Most people just login and play, without engaging in discussions outside the game.
---
How much does Bethesda get from your ISP to run a server for you?
---
you just listed a camera as an update
---
Not bad!
---
If you're not having fun on your own server, that's on you.
---
GTAV then, you can buy your sharkcards there!
---
I can not really recall any other games that'd fit the bill here. You've got MMORPG's yeah, but those are way different from what FO76 is and not comparable.
---
And being past consumer friendly options in AAA games shouldn't mean that we have to lay down and accept it. I enjoyed FO76 multiplayer immensely, but I'd like to get back to it with my friends and enjoy it on our own server. But now we'd have to pay for that shit? Thank you, but nevermind then.
---
not standard, small. the standard one was worth the effort though,  holy hell.
---
To be fair, when someone got me a Fallout hoodie, I couldn't get an NCR Patch across the back fast enough, so I can empathize with being a fanboy. And even Phantom Menace was SOMEBODY'S first star wars, so their loyalty is what it is.
---
try collecting pumpkins nearby the pumpkin house...
---
suddenly a wild scorchbeast appeared 
---
and not just that.. a group of super mutants join the party 
---
...and instead of fighting each other, they all go for me 
---
those pumpkins be holy
---
I wound up with several pistols of all types (bolt action, revolvers, plasma). Ugh.
---
When at whitesprings, many drop things in one of the trash cans outside the room with all the workbenches near the vendors
---
Also an option to turndown the main menu music would be nice.
---
I am happy to pay for my own world since I will be in control of who plays there. I also want to do a solo run on the SBQ just to see if I can do it.
---
Looking ahead towards the Creation Kit being released, I have a bunch of ideas for content I would like to add to the game, and will need a private server to be able to test those out.
---
Just don’t buy it.
---
How do I get hooked up on the discord that Does sbq runs? This solo stuff is old
---
Yeah, no shit. It's ugly and not at all representative of the game.
---
Thank you, may all your purveyor rolls be god rolls.
---
I guess this is your first time reading a PR statement? let me guide you through it: it's all BS.
---
nice roll.
---
Just don't buy what? Any game changing mechanics, updates, or products they decide to add to the atom store?
---
Gta online is a non conventional live service game in that there's no separate currency.  They fixed that in RDO lol.
---
It's not ideal either, I agree.  People have tried resisting it.  But think of how much anti consumer practices the industry has done since ( season passes, online passes, cosmetics only shops, live services ).  Truth be told, your only alternative is indie gaming.
---
Ugh. Don't give them any ideas.
---
 I can bring up any keyed weapon real quick. I have 10 keys ... its enough. ;) I can do this on the run and often do.
---
 I am PC master race though, and used to setting up my games.
---
I just asked on your behalf, and she said "Hrmghrrrmf!" So, I guess congrats/my condolences?
---
I wonder how it will effect the economy of the game and the whole trade sub in general.
---
thats my concern.  will they tailor the challenges to the user (like more pix challenges) if thats how i like to play, or will it do the opposite (fight in power armor) to dry up the atom drip?
---
Unpopular opinion: it’s just the title screen. It doesn’t matter that much
---
I'm not sure that would be to big of a problem as the load would be minimal. I wanted a server so just me and some friends could run around add some extra fun with mods like a zombie survival mode like FO4 has. Though if it was a bunch of people I could see that being an issue.
---
Hey man message me
---
Haha I’ve had that happen before.
---
The scorchbeast part anyway.
---
Excavator itself adds 100 to carry weight, and each calibrated shock adds 50 more.
---
The bug was you got all 200# regardless, but if you exited armor, then reentered, the extra 100 went away until you relogged
---
I think the bug is fixed.
---
If you ate grilled radstag  (or a couple other things), your carry weight will temporarily increase.  Marsupial adds 20 (I think) to your max carry weight. So does grilled radstag.
---
backpacks/armor are unequipped when you enter PA, which would decrease your carry capability when you got in PA.
---
containers at train stations.. overseers camp and Flatwoods  church is where I dump all my crap
---
10$ a month is reasonable.
---
I am with you. Get that Creation Kit in the hands of the community and then we really will rebuild Appalachia.
---
they're worthless if Bethesda is hosting them, which they are.
---
Yea, I've got a group I run with. We've pretty well mastered everything else. 
---
Glad to know the inventory bug has been snipped in the bum. We can focus on the raids now.
---
quit complaining about people complaining.
---
Salty much
---
I always got the idea they chopped bits of each patch and added that to Wastelanders. 
---
Also they focused a lot on the Raids that few people play because the rewards aren't really worth it.
---
Downvoted only so they dont see it xD
---
Then give me a clean example of games that do fit that bill, for I'm recalling none besides MMO's, who truly do live on different principles.
---
Holy shit, I’ve been inactive for a bit on the game and I am totally staying up tonight, it was a great idea to actually add them, less lag.
---
Kinda hard to say until there are more details. Pricing, abilities, where the server is hosted etc. 
---
They've been vague with the news since day one of this game basically. Left lots of room for stipulation and outrage unfortunately.
---
What would someone pay for that? I feel like I over price shit.
---
You pretty much have to be right up in anything face to do good damage. Soothing break fast too it seems
---
As a shotgun build, I strongly advise against two-shot. The problem with TS on shotguns is instead of doubling the pellet count, it only adds one additional pellet. So instead of your 8 pellets, with TS you get 9, not 16 like you’d think. It also makes the pellet spread of the shotgun significantly worse as well as decrease the shotguns durability per shot more than any other legendary effect. 
---
I’d personally recommend either instigating or anti-armor. Unlike most weapons, shotguns don’t have access to an anti-armor perk card, so an AA shotgun is pretty good. For reference I run an Instigating/Less VATS double barrel and a AA/Explosive pump. Word of advice from one shotgunner to another, in VATS 100% of your pellets will hit the target resulting is devastating max damage, so try to incorporate VATS into your build if you can, happy hunting!
---
The only reason i can think of is to have better raid performances. But i'll soon have a full raid PA  and can just gather steel in standard even in laggy servers,so i won't really need it. 
---
Beside i liked and still like the idea of a multiplayer game. Why would i take out what makes it unique?
---
from an objective standpoint that's a valid point.
---
but what if they go the mobile route and it costs me 1 atom per trigger pull?
---
Unlikely. Likely still just on Amazon.
---
I think the same but if the price is high enough atoms would work since you can't really get more than a handful from the free events. It's essentially only money after a few thousand atoms at best.
---
I know I said it in another post but man I really hope they make that Old Possum t-shirt available it is so cool.
---
Same here. Haven’t touched it for a month now. And btw, with Private Servers coming up, won’t that divide the community more? It’s great for group of friends but I loved playing on random servers with random people/ encounters but I feel these will become quite empty.
---
I'm good with delay. If they need time to finish everything - this is the right thing to do.
---
Unfortunately, on the other hand,  I really have nothing more to do in this game. There is a severe lack of content. What should I do another four or five months? Listen to Grafton mayor? Complete another boring event, like "Tea Time"? Pay 500 atoms for wallpaper? Nah, pass. I was waiting for "Wastelanders", new content that will bring back at least some interest to the game. But, "not today" I guess.  
---
Today I will launch the last nuke at SBQ and gonna take a break.
---
The way i want to play, is against random people in PvP. Not nw but how survival was with bounties and map markers from the leaderboard. So i dint think il be getting my wish anytime soon
---
Yes.
---
I love the nw screen it's so nitty gritty !
---
But your backpack gives a 90% spoil reduction, more than the fridge's 50%, plus that means you have to travel back to your camp to put it in the fridge, not to mention take up precious stash space on crafting materials
---
Yes we should all agree but I must insist that it be known as "the valise" rather that 'the suitcase' and it must reside in the Sutton Station.
---
2 toons can move w/o PA, 2 need PA, one is hopelessly overweight. Good problems 👍 lol.
---
That would be awesome. I think their design is 1 game server to 1 vm which is how they spin up and shutdown based on demand. I haven't put any time or effort into sniffing that out but it just makes more sense given how Amazon prices. 
---
I don't envision the private server being something that is constantly running like your traditional "dedicated server" that you host on your own leased/colo'd equipment or rent from a provider. I maintain my theory that it will be no different from a public server except for the addition of access control either by a new ACL system or simply through your friends list.
---
I really like the canning idea as well but if it's in the atomic shop it won't be shareable. I assume it'll be like outfits and the fridge etc. it's only for the person that purchased it. Even if you're on a team with someone. Which in my opinion sucks. So if I'm building someone a camp I can't fill it to the brim with dumb yet eye appealing succulents. If canning came out and was the same way I wouldn't buy it. I like the idea of making tough recipes, canning them, and selling them.
---
All most people really want is just more weapon skins. Clean weapon skins have been suggested multiple times. Yet we seem to rarely get any weapon skins.
---
Too bad the Halloween event doesn't even arrive until the 29th.
---
Yeah, that was a pretty odd statement
---
You’re being ridiculous now
---
It's really live service games in general.  Once that is introduced, then it's all about ensuring you buy from that shop.  Decoupling the game in peer hosted servers removes access to it in a sense.  It's why games like Ghost Recon Breakpoint require an online connection even in single player.
---
That doesn't meant it would stop being an online game, you can still join other people when you want to, just like in GTA V's Online. There you can have a private solo/friend only session for free, albeit you can't do some missions, that's where you join other players when you need to do those missions.
---
I would be willing to bet my fucking life that there will be multiple significant mechanics in Wastelanders that are very closely tied to spending atoms.
---
I'm surprised so few people seemed to notice that particular line, or even be bothered by it. then again, this *is* reddit.
---
the way they phrased it indicates they're going full p2w. I don't think they'd sell legendary gear in the store because that's the only thing keeping people around, but it sure sounds damning.
---
BethesdEA
---
I have seen this theory before and it seems to be pretty popular, however, I want to say they said their wasn't a correlation in the recent data miner AMA. I also get armor from the purveyor most times and only keep heavy combat on my person at any given time, so of course, I get mostly scout, marine, raider and trapper. So maybe it works differently for weapons than armor.
---
Yikes indeed
---
Yikes, was looking forward to playing this Fall. What kind of steps are they taking with the Atom Shop?
---
Even if its cost atoms at the atomic shop I think the ability to buy or obtain a token to do a full respect should be available.
---
Took me most of 2 weeks, and lots of self control. Finally my mania for playing all my possible toons pays off!
---
Can you give me an example of an update they have monitized in any way?
---
All of the utility items have been questionably useful and not anywhere near game breaking, and are hardly even game changing.
---
Honest question, where on the map is the purveyor
---
What platform are you on
---
Absolutely. I totally agree with you. PvP has been diluted to nothing and left by the wayside by Bethesda, they seem to have no motivation to improve the PvP experience.
---
I’m less than a month away from 1,000 hours but i really might leave it at whatever it is at this point i have put a decent stake in this game and i wish it wasn’t thiiis delayed, i get it, i want it to be the best, but I’m not enjoying the revelation thaaaat, the mods are gonna end up being indirectly paid mods what with private servers having a cost attatched. Fallout 4 is calling my name. I mean, i live just north of FO4’s map by about 15-20 miles anyways right?
---
 Just as I thought. ;)
---
Yep, I'm not buying the next elder scrolls, fallout, etc because of this. Releasing a buggy game is one thing, directly lying to customers about the nature of the game and doing things kind this is just despicable
---
I've seen people ask for repair kits but in the sense of let me craft them or buy them at vendors so I can repair on the go. 
---
That they ended up in the Atomshop is just sad. I mean you can earn improved repairkits by fighting the SBQ but you can't sell them or trade them.
---
No sadder than spending hours defending a random game company 💁🏻‍♂️
---
And makes sense, I was speaking out again the China-loving mods over there, they don’t take criticism too well.
---
It has. So far I've only got pipe revolvers so rip me
---
It kind of feels like everyone from this sub that isn't a casual shill dipped out sometime during the last 3 betrayals by Bethesda.
---
I feel bad for all the people posting who are having guns put to their heads by Bethesda to spend money on Atoms and Private Servers.
---
Op did you not read? It isn’t free.. this is confirmed.
---
Was this comment meant for someone else in the thread?
---
I don’t think they’re going to “send it” but they will probably make more convenience items such as junk kits, fridges and things like that. Unfortunately, people on eBay have been making mad money by selling rare legendaries for cash, Bethesda has probably realized that some people will spend real money on shit. The dlc appears to remain free, and the in game content in the atom shop is primarily cosmetic stuff that if you grind challenges you can eventually obtain. The real question is how much are these “private servers” gonna cost and how many people will buy. I will hold my faith that Bethesda doesn’t go EA on us but we shall see.
---
I saw this happen a long time ago actually, I was surprised it didn't catch on. This dude nuked a bit further away than your pic but all three were on top of each other and produced Scorched Earth events.
---
I kinda just wanted to do a private server for myself, I'm not gonna pay for that...kinda a shame you can't host off your own of, I get paying for a server if you want like a ton of players in it...but why can't I host one for myself for free? Kinda crap news imo...
---
just keep in mind a good chunk of the team behind Fo76 consists of monetization specialists. yeah.
---
it may not be as extreme but they could surely make this game a lot less fun for anyone not consistently expending atoms. if every mobile developer does it, why can't Beth? and before you say "because it's a "real" game", remember Fifa.
---
I can’t I’m not defending the game just simply gathering information
---
6 revolvers 2 missiles launchers an the rest were all pipe weapons. Only 2 had reasonable rolls but honestly nobody uses handguns..
---
I can get on board with that.
---
If you get queued to join a world you are on that screen.
---
I feel bad for all the soulless shills that will watch an IP they pretend to like be driven into the fucking ground by a company that only cares about milking every last dollar out of its playerbase. 
---
I hope your wife's boyfriend gets you a Fallout funko pop doll.
---
Who knows? They were very general with the their wording, but did mention they would try and keep a balance to make sure players were not given a “competitive advantage”
---
Well you'd be dead wrong.
---
Depends on how much they will charge for the servers. It’s a good idea in essence but the real question will be how Bethesda handles monetizing it.
---
*Dives head first into the trash*
---
I’m annoyed by this.  We the players should be getting things like the fridge and scrap bot for free, like the backpack and the camera.  It should be integrated into the game as a quest to get it with a small narrative attached.  Utility items are what people want, and I understand some of the monetization of the game but seriously, this is a step in the wrong direction.  As it stands it seems like you’re moving toward the GTA Online and RDO model of treating players like piggy banks.  
---
This is how you do long term damage to your company for short term gains.
---
Yeah, no mickey taking with the atom prices for them either!
---
&gt; It feels purposefully vague, like it was written by a politician. 
---
This is a very typical PR spin piece. It's intended to sell you a message and often that message isn't the truth.
---
&gt;  It also feels like they’re saying we’re going to see lots of non-cosmetic items in the shop. If they’re along the lines of what we’ve seen so far, no big deal.

You should see it as a big deal. The advantages you get now are relatively small but they are advantages (notice the lie in the PR piece). All the utility items are time savers. Less time spent dropping off junk to free stash, to repair items etc. means more time to farm XP, caps, scrap &amp; legendaries.
---
We don't see the effects now because more people are beyond max level so there is no real advantage to exploit. However, once the prestige system comes into play, watch that advantage take hold over PvP. All that time you save builds up exponentially.
---
Also, those utility items ARE pay-to-avoid-inconvenience so by your own definition, we need to have a talk now.
---
Not to be that guy but there are people that aren't interested in cyber punk as well. I get what you are saying but people will play
---
So just to make sure for the private servers, thats not going to have our public characters progress right? if they want to do this right they need to make us make new characters for each new private server and keep our public character profile separate. Otherwise we could literally just buy a server, increase the legendary spawn rates and drops with the server files and then go romp on a pub server with all the shiny new gear.
---
combine shotgun perks with vats crits
---
they fill your crit meter extremely fast and vats crits will let you penetrate armor
---
also try to get hands on a VE shotgun, one vats hit will heal half your hitpoints
---
but id suggest to keep a damage dealer on you for bigger targets
---
use enforcer to cripple your opponent with your shotgun and finish it off with something like a power fist
---
But what are some 'live service games' then? Ghost Recon Breakpoint's apparantly one, but we can all see what kind of dumpster fire that became. I guess The Division 2 would count as well then?
---
Would 'Unturned' count as a live service game too? It has microtransactions and updates! Heck, Rust even has cosmetics, and we can still have our private servers!
---
Doesn't mean that if the big boys do shitty practices, that it should be allowed.
---
Doesn’t the game do that now for people in the area?
---
Thats what my guess was going to be also, $15 a month.  It'll be interesting to see how grouping and teaming will work.  Does everyone need to subscribe like WoW or will it be something different?  If your friends aren't on or chose not to subscribe are you then all alone?
---
If I give you my gear you'll have no reason to continue playing.
---
When the game drops on Steam we could finally see player count.  I feel like the player count is tiny. I keep running into the same players and have never been in a full server outside of meat week and the time they had free to play. This latest inside the vault has me worried.
---
\*competitive against other players
---
:\^)
---
No, I sold mine... it may be nice to cripple the shit out of things and laugh at them, but you have to be so close you may as well use a Powerfist or something lol
---
Two shot is horrible on accuracy
---
Is this true?
---
I like the openness of this communication. We all saw it happening, nice to have it out in the open. Glad they are holding back new dlc. If it is trash when it launches, I feel like this game is doomed.
---
Can you give me an example of any time before today where they've publicly announced that the atomic shop is no longer for cosmetic items? 
---
How does that logic even work? Does every bad thing have to happen on two separate occasions for it to be bad?
---
I like that
---
lol @ salt poster who immediately accuses stranger of salt for making light of salt.
---
With a private server you  can control who connects, so essentially you can ensure that most of the time areas scale to your level.
---
Those are some impressive mental gymnastics. Are you combining Egghead and Marsupial mutations? 
---
It was a joke.
---
No , the soundtrack just follows me around ominously wherever I go , gaming or not gaming.
---
No. Certain areas are level capped
---
Literally what they said....
---
I mean, it was aight for a while.
---
Also Mini Nukes, I can put boring regular ammo in my display case but not anything cool.
---
At the end of the day, it's all about capitalism.  Bethesda made a product and can choose to sell it how they want.  How we feel about it is on us, as consumers.  We decide its fate ultimately.  Realistically, they have no obligation to us as we have no obligation to them.
---
Well consider me put in my place.
---
I am just super excited to play with the faction I am in on our own server haha
---
https://discord.gg/pbybvf5
---
You on PC, xbox or ps4?
---
Yes please I'm so sick of that shit it.
---
That you have to run from. Everything else is not a big deal.
---
That'd just make things worse, they'd inevitably show off some things they might change or remove when the actual update comes
---
Yeah, flux a plenty!
---
I'd even be ok with just some new mods to current guns, like a 308 receiver for combat rifles. Or bring in the 7.62 for the handmade.
---
Ha! Good point.
---
I'm not the guy you asked, but I work in IT, and I can tell you that no, no software dev does - that would be insane, nor would i expect that.
---
Which is why everyone was so skeptical when good old Uncle Pete told us that BGS would be financing these servers until the end of time, yet not have ANY paid DLC or subscription fee. 
---
I pay $15 per month for Classic WoW, and I pay that gladly, because the devs listen, they fix bugs, implement solutions, etc. When I pay that $15, I know that it is spent on developing the game. When I spend money on the atomic shop, I am 90% sure it's just going towards funding more atomic shop items.
---
I will be having a PvP focused server and if the configuration of server permits it it will be like the survival before global nerf
---
I was thinking about trying a full bolstering build, just to see how much defense it provides. Mainly heavy combat.
---
The majority of the fallout community are solo players. If you open up free servers for everyone almost everyone will have their own server which is just plain stupid.
---
  On top of that the servers are not client side so Bethesda would have to pay for every single server.
---
 Which if you been following Bethesda last few years they're not keen on spending their own money on the playersbase.
---
FF7 is getting ALL MY TIME! Hell, starting next week when Outer worlds comes out this game is a non existent memory. Only thing that had me keeping an eye on 76, seeing as how I haven’t played in months, was Wastelanders. How long do they think “meat week” or more “atomic shop novelties” will keep people on the hook?
---
....right?
---
yea, when I see people asking for features, all I think about is how bethesda is going to charge for it.
---
I wish there was some consistency there, or at least with the level of the legendary.  
---
I've got 2 stars that have the base combat armour look and a 1-star with the Heavy look. Something should allow you to adjust or craft them from base to sturdy to heavy
---
Well it was either compete with those, with a hopefully done update or compete with Outer Worlds with what was/is a incomplete update. Pick your battles.
---
If they're pushing it back to Q1, you can bet that it's because they *think* they *might* be able to have a usable and somewhat stable product by the end of March.
---
You don't delay release for no good reason, certainly not to line up with your competitors (unless you're so huge is doesn't matter).  It's delayed so they can get it 'right' (for BGS).
---
Erm the battle pass is £10 Per season so how is that free?
---
Enclave scientist/soldier outfits and a full black Enclave X-01 paint with the white E or circle of stars emblem.
---
I'm still clinging to the hope that someday seasons will be added, so maybe winter clothing as well.
---
Why? You'll just be able to buy better legendaries from the Atom Shop soon.
---
Can you don't
---
You assume a lot there.  That's always a bad thing to do with BGS.
---
[Im preeetty happy with it](https://imgur.com/a/kQhXmcO) (Mask was in the folder from me making a trade link, obviously not from the purveyor)
---
Having troubles coming up with 'live service games' yourself, eh?
---
And that's a bullshit statement. If you're a business, you're not meant to start screwing over your customers, even if that's in your liberty to do.
---
Besides, they did promise private servers down the line as a feature, with no notion of it having to be bought. Then again, they also said only cosmetic items, but that's also changed.
---
I enjoyed FO76 at launch, unlike many others, but if we have to pay for the private servers they promised before launch, then they've truly lost me.
---
They said we'd be able to share our servers, or at least implied it in the article
---
Exactly how i feel....people just need something to complain about.
---
Unfortunately, on the other hand, I really have nothing more to do in this game. There is a severe lack of content. What should I do another four or five months? Listen to Grafton mayor? Complete another boring event, like "Tea Time"? Pay 500 atoms for wallpaper? Nah, pass. I was waiting for "Wastelanders", new content that will bring back at least some interest to the game. But, "not today" I guess.
---
Tomorrow I will launch the last nuke at SBQ and gonna take a break.
---
I honestly don't miss seeing female ghouls that sound like Marge Simpson, it's a bit creepy.
---
Yes I have. 1 is on the left 2 is on the right. When I use the one on the left it removed Paired Keycard 1 and vice Versa
---
I would go towards modding the gun to use less ap perk vats hit, aligned mods and the quicker reload mag help in this area. And I suggest the severe receiver to compliment the crit damage, or just go full hardened for max damage output.
---
Honestly as a solo player I am nervous about private servers. I like doing 90% of the game alone but for things like events i enjoy others showing up. I worry with private servers public events will no longer have enough people wanting to do them.
---
Firstly the backpack give you 90% ONLY if you go for that option. Even with that, for anything you stash, that still gets the 50%.
---
Come on dude, don't be an apologist. Look at the issue objectively. IF you choose to use the fridge, you have 50% less need to find and stash food if that's what you do because it last that much longer. Not to mention being able to repair on the fly so you don't need to bring extra weapons or spend the time going to a workbench to repair it, to find rare scrap for those repairs to replenish stocks.
---
All these utility items objectively save you time. I'm sure you can agree on that. And if it saves you time, it means more time to get XP and legendaries. You'd agree that's an advantage, right?
---
Yes I'm sure the 1000s of game for free on steam store are only a year old and have the same scope as fallout 76..... not a comparable game at all. that's like comparing a moped to a sports car...yes they may do something slightly similar but there not really comparable are they
---
Lose now or lose later.
---
totally agree
---
even little things like they did with some random encounters shortly befor the wastelanders release where you could stumble across brahmin with misterious quills
---
add something like this
---
add dead scouts that carry letters, explaining how they plan to come to appalachia
---
maybe introduce a few merchants like grahm but humans or ghouls
---
Try switching servers my father in law had the same issue that’s what he did
---
If you can't discern the difference on your own, I can't help you.
---
Or you know, host a dedicated server yourself, which is free?
---
For Ark, Conan Exiles and so on, I mean. You can do the multiplayer thing or actually host your own dedicated server..
---
do you think there would be a one year sale?
---
I thought releasing utility items on 3 seperate occasions was evidence enough. I dont need to be told something is red if it very clearly is that color. 
---
I had my doubts about cosmetic only atom store from the get go. Im actually curious if I have ever seen a post from bethesda and not one of their employees promising this.
---
I don't think its a lot to assume you can password protect or whitelist a private server at all.
---
Ohhhh I knowwww.... Had two custom built ones thinking it would save me money.....
---
Do you normally post in subs of games you don't play?
---
So one person could pay for a whole group?  I'm liking that thought , a lot.  I personally would not mind paying for me and my friends.
---
Dude states whenever he's missing information, credits other people's work, and provides a lot of content with as much information as is available. Who cares if his videos have exaggerated titles? Watch his content or don't, but in order to have a steady channel on YouTube you need growth. Can't grow your channel if you aren't getting clicks.
---
You mean I have to pay for a new head unit?? NO! I’M SELLING MY CAR AND WALKING.
---
Agreed. Would defeat the “private server” monocle If otherwise.
---
10mm SMG needs some new sights and a suppressor, the Single-Action Revolver, LMG, and .50 Cal need some mods period. Lots of weapons could be raised out of obscurity with some new options for them.
---
Honestly, I would have chosen to compete with Outer Worlds with an extra month of development, than either of the two (potentially) biggest contenders of the decade, with my (even polished) expansion pack. Outer Worlds could be great, and does share a market, but it also doesn't have millions of people drooling over it.
---
Then let them be clientside, Bethesda won't have to spend a dime on hosting them, and people will be able to go online whenever they want to!
---
IMO, it means Wastelanders will be the last large content update for a long, long time. Everything else added to the game will be a drip feed of absurdly priced "utility" items that have been long requested by the community, along with the normal 20+ dollar cosmetic item packs.
---
What difference? Why the condescending tone?
---
I've kept asking you for other examples of this practice, and besides the flop that is breakpoint or the Division 2 (which I came up myself), I've yet to hear any other example of 'live services games'. Bloody Rust has a microtransaction system (skins) that you can buy, and still host your own dedicated server!
---
Not sure why you would have thought hosting a private server would be free.  More servers means more resources needed to maintain them.
---
Not free, you'll need a spare Xbox or PC running 24/7 on your power bill, I'd rather pay 10$ a month even though I have a spare pc
---
I’m sorry did I post or comment on a pretty generic question having zero to do with in game activities. Big difference, chief.
---
Except, those games gave you the tools to host your own dedicated server...
---
So utilities are the most purchased items? Congratulations you idiots, you fucked those of us who actually liked gameplay rewards
---
&gt;certainly not to line up with your competitors
---
I mean clearly my implication is that this is a terrible move (what's wrong with December for example?) considering just how many potentially heavy hitters are coming out Q1 next year. I've been looking forwards to Wastelanders, but if it hits around the time of either, it goes last in line. But surely they can't have missed when their release window roughly falls and what they might be competing with.
---
Private servers open up a lot of things and ways to enjoy the game in a new way. Giving us private servers will keep options open until wastelanders.
---
I was thinking max level everywhere including events. Now it only scales them to the area and only after they re-spawn.
---
Plus, Wastelanders would be pretty directly competing with the PC release of RDR2
---
The 2 problems I see with that are cheating and lots of lag.
---
 They would only work if characters were locked on to client side servers.  Especially when mods are released and allowed.
---
 I'm sure they thought every scenario possible and renting servers was the best solution.
---
At this point ive come to terms with 76 just being a test to see how well they can get there online servers up before starfield is released. Im cool with it i get to play a fallout game and they get to prepare for another big game
---
Intresting
---
I mean this could be addressed by making the effects of those things not as potent as something that was fresh (spoilable). Like make them use the same materials to cook up, but honestly I would make it a pain in the ass to cook. Like make it so that one you need a preservative, and two the proper type of can/jar for the product you wish to make. That would mean that you can't just junk all of your jars and cans that you find all the time. I would also make the canned version heavier.
---
Ok.
---
Say you sell Cars, RVs, Jetskis, and ATVs. 
---
Your RV and Car sales are ok, but your recreational vehicle sales are booming....
---
You're looking to expand the product choices you offer..... Are you going to start selling Trucks to go with your cars and RVs? Or are you going to offer dirt bikes?
---
All they need is another event than just the Halloween one to tie us over until FASCHNACHT
---
You’re kidding right?
---
Stop fucking with me, I know you'rem mentally sound enough to recognize the difference between "maybe we can get away with this" and "Hey everyone, we're going to do this".   
---
If you're capable of remembering things that occurred a year ago, both Pete Hines and Todd Howard said multiple times that Atomic Shop items would be cosmetic only. I'm not sure if it was ever stated by them in text on reddit, but, believe it or not, a world exists outside of this cesspool full of shills.
---
I do heavy weapons/melee. 
---
I don't use damage perk cards. I do use the Adrenalin perk card (usually at rank 3, though I have a 1 and a 5 as well that I will sometimes use depending on what other cards I want active) for that damage boost after killing an enemy. It makes a huge difference with mobs.
---
I add the prime receiver to most of my weapons, which ups the damage on them a decent amount, and the ammo is more efficient to craft for some weapons (like the LMG and Plasma Gatling for instance). 
---
At the beginning of a session where I plan to go hunting, I usually will use a Heavy Guns Bobblehead and a Magazine that boosts damage to the type of enemy I am planning to hunt. I have the perk cards that help you find them so I always have a surplus. I also hit the Psychobuff for another damage boost.
---
The most crucial piece though is the Medic Pump mod on my power armor torso. It hits you with a stimpack when you drop below 50% health, and unlike the regular armor legendary effect and the perk card, there is no cool down time, so it will hit you over and over if you keep dropping below 50% health. It makes you almost immortal (except against Yao-Guai and Mirelurk Kings) but you need to keep a decent stock of stimpacks on hand and watch your rads. 
---
While I don't mow down mobs with a single pull of the trigger, I still chew through them pretty quick. If they get too close, I pull out the Instigating Grognak's Axe or Executioner's Fire Axe.
---
About what?
---
I would assume that anything done on private servers won't transfer to the public ones.  It would be far to easy to cheat the intended system of the game otherwise.
---
Fix legendary drops to prenerf levels, increase mob population, and I'd be really happy.
---
I hear you and I even agree but it's mostly personal for me because I will not stick around. If Bethesda actually finished this game before release they wouldn't have to delay everything. Every update starts some new fires because the base of the game has never been stable enough to build on. 
---
I feel like we had very little content  being out a year and Wastelanders was the main reason I kept logging in. But because Bethesda is still patching bugs that have been here for months (or even since release) they need to delay this for months.
---
Not going to beat a dead horse and say this game is done because it's not, but I can assure you that a bunch of players will be moving on from the game after this news.
---
Not really, let's take Ark for example, have played that on my hosted dedicated server.
---
I host the game, and run it from the same setup, and voila, me and my friends had plenty of fun in our private little server! No issues at all, and no need for that second setup!
---
And a private dedicated server doesn't need to be run 24/7 for your friends, since you know each others schedules and you know... play together only!
---
Psst...want to trade for a rolling pin? 
---
Congratulations!
---
Flesh and blood people feel weird in this game. It’s been so long.
---
Yes, I will certainly tell anyone who is wondering if they should buy scamout 76 what you said. You have a healthy attitude towards the current state of computer gaming. "Just don't buy it" are wise words in deed.
---
Cheating and lag is already present, paying for your own servers won't fix that.
---
Paid mods? Nooo thank you.
---
Thanks for the tip:) good to know I won't need to gamble for a full set.
---
Well that depends if they are gonna do that event again but either way I do agree that would be nice
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'd hope that would be the case.  Point me to something that BGS said that gives you some idea that it will work that way though.  
---
And look at everyone's track record so far about expectation vs reality.
---
For character 1, what should I scrap, what should I sell, what should I keep? 
---
For character 2, what's a good armor for a sniper?
---
For character 3, is unyielding better, or bolstering?
---
Can you share the stats and perks of you build?
---
Whatever will they provide, as long as they allow owners kicking people out, there will be servers where pacifism ain't permitted :3
---
If they don't think it will be ready before then, they can't move it up, so the only option is to move it back...and that might be worse than not moving it.
---
Ran it for 3 months before I got the Elder paint. Definitely worth the grind!
---
Almost every camp has collectron, how is this PR statement?
---
Yea that would be nice if you want to get legendaries 24/7 I feel like that ain't enough though to keep people in the game
---
If you look around right behind the house instead of where the map marker is, you can safely find enough pumpkins and do so especially easily if you have green thumb
---
For the repair kits, I wonder if you do many Queen events. Because you get 3 BETTER repair kits every time you finish a Queen. Also the scrap bot doesn't give you rare materials like ballistic fiber or flux. If you paid for Legendaries themselves then it would be an advantage imo
---
'Our goal for players who purchase this service is to offer something for everyone, not just those who want a private server'
---
Im calling it now, theres going to be a bunch of features getting rolled out to people who pay for private servers that cross over into public servers.
---
The main draw isnt going to be the private server, its going to be all the stuff that comes with it. This is just their way of coming up with a sub model thats disguised as something else. 
---
This 'service' will launch and a couple of weeks/months later the main game will go f2p 
---
TL;DR I think this is their sneaky way of making 76 a f2p game with a subscription.
---
“Most aggressively monetized triple A title”. Lol
---
Oh it's not, not by a long shot. But then again neither is delaying wastelanders
---
Or they could, you know, put in the effort to make a server tool like older games did, so we can host our own dedicated servers and they don't have to worry about the cost. I guess that wouldn't be yet another source of income though.
---
Good bot
---
I’m confused, does 2k not exist anymore?
---
It's very effective but that's about it. But also the closer you are to death, the higher chance you have of dying by one hits. The multiple hits is fine. I would suggest nerd rage to alleviate the damage.
---
That is exactly what just happened to me! Uuuugh, what a waste, lol!
---
They said that it was already in an ITV article
---
That was sarcasm, i meant the monetization. Didn't meant to be rude.
---
Never saw the point. They never interested me. If people want them, cool. Go for it. I just hope there aren’t resources now being funneled to private server exclusive mods sold by BGS... which seems very likely.
---
Private servers only last 3 months, because its only one person paying, if that person doesnt want to play anymore, why pay?
---
And thats the point, why should i pay for others to play?
---
I just want to play on my own or at most with a friend or two and thats it.
---
This one way trip is their only solution if they want to allow modding, otherwise you could with a single mod ruin the economy of the official servers.
---
We have different characters for other modes as well, so why would this be different?
---
Can we go back to the original one I really liked it
---
Yea. I was figuring that the regular cards should be up. About the only card that I should use that I haven’t been using lately, is serendipity.
---
Anyone know if the Wastelanders DLC will include new ps4 trophies?
---
Comments to this went the exact way I predicted it would. You shared a hard truth.
---
Bloodied does that, and a whole lot more, quite easily using a meathook (gets both unarmed and 1H effects)
---
-  Adrenal reaction (+ damage at low health)
---
-  Talons (+25% unarmed damage)
---
-  Twisted Muscles (+25% melee damage)
---
-  5 pcs Unyielding Armor (+15 S total)
---
-  All 3 one handed perks (+60% damage)
---
-  Iron Fist (+20% unarmed damage)
---
I feel like it's a positive. You'll be able to invite others into your world more than likely, so it really will be Fallout with Friends then
---
Q1 2020 is 5 months away?
---
Nice idea! That'd be particularly interesting with chameleon'd players, I imagine.
---
Anti armor weapons are great if you don't want to deal with having low health or being addicted.
---
I managed to get a AA FFR Gatling Plasma. I dont use heavy weapons.. but still! Better than all the ghoul slayers crossbows/.44 magnums I've been getting. Should sell for something
---
Bad as it would lower the amount of players willing to play on multiplayer.
---
I wouldn't expect a one-time fee. I'd like that, but it wouldn't make sense from Bethesda's perspective. $5-$10 a month is my completely uneducated and unsubstantiated guess. There's no need for it to be spun up 24/7 if no one's signed into it, so other than whatever's saved to disk your average private server isn't using any resources for 80 or 90% of the hours in a month. Not knowing how much horsepower a server needs makes it impossible to estimate the cost of a hundred hours of use in a month, but unless the server-side is exceptionally hungry, $5-$10 would still be enough to cover the bills and net Bethesda a little profit
---
i dont expect public servers to be empty i guess the vast majority of people wont pay and wont be part of a group that uses private servers
---
They are doing it again. They’ve mentioned it several times. They are going to be reworking it for the spring.
---
I just like to play games
---
Bloodied build. I have one and regularly hit around 3000 with the right perks and consumables.
---
2000 scrip spent (Including re-scriping for 300)
---
Got 2 Fixers, Keeping 1
---
3 Bloodied (Fixer, Hunting Rifle and UGL)
---
Couple of niche items that someone might find interesting, and large amount of Junk
---
Private servers are going to be full of cheats and exploits. Bring forth the dupes!
---
1000 scrip...  and everything was shit for me...
---
I doubt they’ll release Wastelanders in January. March is the end of Q1. That is 5 ish months away.
---
Instigating lever action using stealth build. 1,700ish headshots without even being hit as I crouch through mobs.
---
And hopefully more stable.
---
See I'm not unhappy with my console. 
---
I'm irritated because PC player seem to think because they CAN do something.....it should be free.... Because other games offer something...it should be free....
---
It's like walking into a gym and demanding to use their treadmills for free....because you can walk not in the gym ....
---
Are you kidding? I been hosting servers for free since the 90's.
---
I would settle for an offline mode also..
---
Not defending it, but BGS has absolutely zero reason to not do this when it's making them so much money.  The utility items are the highest selling in the shop, so of course they're making more.  Blame the group of players that decided to buy into this utility nonsense.  Had everyone banded together and not bought any repair kits when they first dropped we could have nipped this in the bud.  But it's far too late now.  Bethesda knows people will pay a lot of money for these things, so now we're stuck with them.
---
[Here](https://mobile.twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241?lang=en) is an example of pete hines saying it. 
---
But I cant seem to find it being said by anyone else. 
---
We live in an era of proof. And today it is more important than anything, it woild seem. This can be observed everywhere. 
---
If its not in writing or recorded in some way, than it physically means nothing, although it may be morally absent. 
---
Im not telling you that you cant leave the game, or boycott the questionable utility items that generally suck. If you can find a source for anyone besides pete hines, I really do want to see it. Because ive looked.
---
Ok, 
---
I have the Talons mutation, i use the bloodied grognak axe, i have all 3 slugger perks and i’m around 250 damage...
---
Is the unyielding armor that important?
---
I'm still building my maelee character but I got a bloodied bone weapon, 1 piece of unyielding armor, 2 of the 3 gladiator cards.
---
With low hp, booze, glowing meat steak, and sneak attack I did 2000 against mole miners.
---
Had to switch to 3rd person to see the attack point.
---
I'm PC and I'd love to hop into some silo and SBQ action
---
They said private servers would have access to mods eventually. This is pretty much already confirmed. It makes sense why public servers wouldn't allow mods
---
OW will have like 20-30 hours of gameplay max
---
Then why you here
---
I just think people can be a bit entitled.  Yes there are issues with the game.  (Anyone who bought a Bethesda game thinking it would be a bug-free masterpiece needs their head examined.)  But I think at some point we have to be realistic about the continued development and support for the game.  It is selling for $32.  That's not a lot of money.  I don't play Adventure mode anymore to see how crowded the servers are but the Nuclear Winter servers have gotten pretty empty.  With less and less people playing the game, they have to keep the servers running somehow.  They made a compromise when they said no paid DLC.  The Atomic Shop keeps the lights on.  I don't want pay-to-win either, but people who think these servers are going to run forever without expanding the player base or the Atomic Shop have their heads in the sand.
---
Private servers need modding support STAT or they won't really matter.
---
&gt; and they have the unused Survival servers laying around.
---
No they don't.  They don't have *any* servers, they rent them from Amazon.

Sneak Peak Q1 2020: Wastelanders
---
I'm simply pointing out that if BGS wanted to sell more shit, I doubt they'd inflate a specific category's sales to try to sell more..... It doesn't really makes sense to pad the numbers for the utility category to try and sell more utility items. 
---
You simply sell more of what people buy the most of.... Not lie to try and convince people to buy stuff their not already buying....
---
I mean, fuck, why risk the backlash to push more utility items if they aren't selling well?
---
I'm willing to bet the collectron is an exception because it's essentially a funny little companion. not because people are so stoked for paid content.
---
the fridge would be a better measurement and I rarely see one.
---
I'm glad it works well for you but for me and many others that would be unplayable, my friends all put their bases in different parts of the map for PVP and trading biome specific resources/tames and play at different times because of our work schedules so a hosted server doesn't work for us at all
---
I'd leave my PC on but I'm not comfortable having it run while I am not there because of the power bill and fire hazard and would rather pay for a server
---
Paid private servers are fair however they said
---
Its literally a sub model. This has got to be  the start of the slow descent into p2w
---
That’s not what I said. Who is making the mods? If they are community mods that is one thing. If they are mods developed by Bethesda, that is another.
---
Of course you will.  It will most likely be a monthly subscription type thing.
---
THIS
---
People asked for repair kits more like new vegas had u collect junk then u craft the kit im surprised they havent added lunchboxes yet
---
Awesome job on the Fixers!  If I ran a bloody set-up, I'd make an offer for the UGL.  I have a Vamp one that I use and I just love that gun.
---
As they say, "close enough" only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades, and strategic nuclear warheads.
---
Still waiting on an answer. Don't leave me hanging, bro.
---
Next week is outerworlds!
---
It would be great if they had a survival server of some type
---
Clearly never played neverwinter for example. That game is pay to win. Campaign buy outs and refinement items that are only avalible through their currency, or a terrible conversion from in game currency.
---
Can they make the animation in the background 1440p also? That's be nice thanks.
---
for longevity private servers are the only thing that will keep me interested (even if wastelanders is a brand new games worth of content, which it probably won't be)... but I don't really play games to meet new people, so I don't mind it. I hear you on it being a miss step, but at this point...with all the bad press, I would really like to see who exactly is coming to this game fresh anyway? all fallout fans have already been here. fresh player numbers seems kinda inconsequential at this point. but i haven't looked at their books.
---
I think if the private server is just the regular game but somebody allows people in or kicks them out, there will be no problems with using your characters.
---
Oh after rereading I understand what you mean. Resources being funneled to mods, not mods being a resource only available to private worlds. Hmm didn't think about that! Maybe it will be like the Creation Club, mods being developed by trusted community modders
---
My money says your friends list is your white list and when it comes to needing to get rid of somebody, well they'll be working on it just like they're perpetually working on making the friends list work.
---
All I can do is hope that moddable private servers will be able to offset "inconveniences" artificially added to boost atom sales - and hopefully even prevent people from using atomic shop items that do have an in-game impact.
---
I want to know what the prices are going to be. if it's anything like the over pricing they've pulled with the atomic shop..... it'll be another shit show.  
---
I've wanted, and my friends also, dedicated servers. Having up to 24 people, who aren't acting like chimp dicks, playing and having fun is a dream we've had.
---
BUT!
---
If it's an overpriced shit show... fuck it.
---
I mean they had such a warning for fo4 mods
---
It'll push your STR higher which will directly effect melee damage output
---
It is content, just a tiny little bit though.
---
Eh, I'll wait for the GotY edition when Obsidian's got all the bugs worked out.
---
It would be pretty shitty if they allowed you to accumulate resources in a private server and then bring them over to a public server ... this is definitely paying for an advantage. I hope anything you accumulate in your private server stays there
---
Oh yeah, no worries, that's a perfectly legitimate example of where payed hosted servers are good for.
---
But that doesn't mean that removing the option for people like me to host it ourselves is a normal thing.
---
You can also nuke the queen in a way where you fight her outside the nuke zone, so you don’t have to worry about rads
---
I’m calling it now, private servers will 100% have paid mods sold as “plugins” this is what Bethesda wanted all along, now since they’ve locked out modders they can charge whatever they like
---
Rdr2 isn't out on PC yet...
---
I thought ESO was the most aggressive monetized AAA title of all time. F76 has $100 mansions that are completely empty? People who say F76 is bad haven't seen ESO
---
How would that break the game?
---
The answers Bloodied lol. Unyielding set + Bloodied melee weapons, mutations and max strength melee cards. With Adrenaline mutation, nerd rage you’ll become an invincible god of unending speed, carrying capacity and brutality.
---
They said that items that provided an in-game function were popular, so there would be more of that content added. Because nothing screams "PAY TO WIN!!!!" quite like a fridge that slightly reduces the amount of time it takes raw meat to spoil.
---
100% agree ... i have similar concerns
---
You are aware of who Pete Hines is, right?
---
Yeah I think there should be an option to use an Xbox/pc as a dedicated server, but Bethesda is definitely looking to make some money from this
---
Heh, gotta pay to use mods. Fuck that shit.
---
I want to have a white t shirt with a quote "It just works".
---
Wait til next year
---
It really do be like that
---
Perhaps have it play Appalachian Radio?
---
this article is all bad news .. this is bethesda trying to sugarcoat the addition of pay to win. it will probably take a couple months for the full effects to be felt, but this will change the game
---
I’m in no rush to finish it. And I’m sure modders will be adding content like they did with NV.
---
Turn that hook into a bloody hook and you’ll laugh at that vampire one. Just saying
---
&gt; The ability to play in your own private world with your friends has been the number one community-requested feature, and we’re thrilled it’s finally coming. 
---
Has it? I want pserver as much as the next guy, but im pretty sure stable official servers has been a bigger request for months now...
---
1. I'd take the best piece from each set so you have a good -15% damage from most creatures all of the time. Scrip/sell the rest. Maybe keep Troubleshooter set for Silos and Encryptid. 
---
2. You can work toward some combat armor or some combination of leather and robot armor for well rounded defense, I like to run off and rehide if I am discovered so a few pieces with Cavaliers effect is good. I have seen people use 5 pieces of chameleon with muffled/shrouded mod and the +sneak legendary effect as well to pretty much never be discovered. My junkies character just uses Weightless armor and has chameleon mutation and his sneak is pretty good too.
---
3. Unyielding is better, my bloodied guy uses 4 unyielding and a chameleon but Im going to go 5 unyielding as soon as I get a good unyielding chest piece. Bolstering is okay if you're lower level getting the hang of bloodied character imo, I used 3 or 4 bolstering for awhile.
---
I can get you the plan later tonight if you need it and are on xbox one. I have the key already and will open the door and server hop as many times as needed to get it for you. That quest is so buggy I was lucky to get the key when I did so I know the frustration. Let me know if I can help you out.
---
Usually it does that for me as well if I'm still in that general area and it just has the enemy marked with the small yellow marker in some random spot. I've had it spawn pretty far away a few times or just completely bug out.
---
That's not a bad price for what you get in 76 now, there is more content and stability now when compared to release. What platform would you be getting it on as well?
---
I wouldn't even compare it to Fallout3/NV/4 as it is a completely different experience! I enjoyed the game, wouldn't want to pay full price again but would happily pay that price.
---
For they hadn't have enough from us buying the game and the microtransaction shop!
---
If it turns out there really will not be an option to host it ourselves eventually, then it seems Bethesda has managed to finally push me away as well!
---
We can point at specific bugs all we want but they aren't slouching on bug fixes, balance changes and new content here.
---
Sadly I’m on PS4 but I appreciate the offer
---
Im curious how characters will function on private servers vs official servers. I hope they're separate, or allow us to migrate our characters to private servers but make it a one way trip.
---
I would...really like a code to have it linked or something considering the amount of people that probably pre-ordered.
---
If only this modern generation could take this amount of rage and point it toward the fees banks charge for ATM use and just having an account. Nope....we can't get past Bethesda's Atom Shop.
---
Somewhere in my mind I almost feel like this is truly the ONLY reason for the delay.
---
.50 Single Action.
---
Gimmie gimmie.
---
2 for 5 over here.
---
Got two Fixers myself
---
Bloodied, Faster Fire Rate, 15% Faster Crit meter
---
and
---
Stalkers, Explosive, 250DR
---
Yes. Where exactly did I say “I don’t play”? If you interpreted “haven’t played in months” as in I’ve never played, that’s your problem. So I’ll continue to comment however I please.
---
Well, if the fact that it's Fallout and only $20 aren't enough to convince you, then maybe it's not for you.
---
I’ve tried doing that several times. I try and if it doesn’t work I hop servers to try again.
---
I know some people won't be but what I was getting at is the majority will be meaning not many people will play Wastlanders if that is the case and it would be a shame for wastelanders to release to not many people playing the game at the time
---
Will be able to buy faction uniforms on Atom Shop. Does that count?
---
It does, haters just prefer to disregard because SPORTSBALL and Lebron
---
Would be getting it on PS4 , I’m thinking about doing it just for the wv lore alone. Also they have a town in the game that I live near (harpers ferry) and I am very curious to see how good they implemented these places into the game.
---
Useful is relative to a person’s build, so this is pretty much a no go.
---
3-500 Atoms, did you say?
---
HAHAHA i told yah they were gonna delay it. Wait till Q1 and they delay it even more. Just fix the game already BGS i'm beyond annoyed with it. I'm level 380ish and have spent my fair share of atoms i just dont see a point of playing, the game runs so poorly, everything is so buggy and there still hasnt been any adjustments or buffs to the vault 94 raid..wtf? Like c'mon already. Not surprised by this announcement at all.
---
I mean it’s a start...
---
It’s a Similar but different beast than previous Fallouts, and has definitely improved since launch woes. Much more solitary and quiet, it feels like you’re the only one left at times.  I’ve gotten a lot more mileage out of 76 than I thought I would.
---
Give it a few minutes b4 each server
---
3 stars dropping 3 stars should just be a thing, tbh.
---
I mean I am interested , it’s just how bad people are saying it is and people basically calling it unplayable , so it’s still 20 dollars I don’t want to waste , that’s why I was asking opinions. So I can see how the game has held up and if there have been any good changes. I pretty much am convinced , I just wanted some opinions before I got it.
---
You should think about buying a lottery ticket.
---
See here's your problem. 
---
These "utility items" don't solve "inconveniences" that has been baked into the game already. 
---
Not one. What they do is allow lazy gamers to skip over game mechanics, not even really.... Just minimize them. 
---
The collectron is borderline useless aside from me loving it's poor sense of humour....
---
The fridge is useless if you just....wander around....and stop at any cooking station for 15 seconds....once an hour? 
---
Repair kits? Ditto. I've never used a repair kit, and I somehow have a bunch on my level 106.....
---
Scrap kits? Ditto. With camps and train stations, you're almost always just a few minutes from anywhere with a bench and a stash.
---
And the next person to tell me food spoilage is not a survival game staple mechanic.... But a built in "inconvenience" to make money needs to give their head a shake.
---
Useful as in limiting output options. I'm fine with getting a bloodied gamma even tho I have the grounded mutation and run a Vangaurd build ... Mostly just limiting out the bad options. Creating a smaller pool for higher scrip
---
&gt;Yeah the Fallout 76 lore is really good. You have to explore and look for it, which makes it even better.
---
Definitely 100%. And bringing the characters in as proper NPCs makes it all the more rewarding for people who are into it imo.
---
For the controversy of course
---
The vp of bethesda softworks, which is owned by another company. It very clearly was not something he shouldve said. 
---
He is the only one to blame for this promise being broken. Because hes the only one. That I know of. To promise it. 
---
Again, please find evidence opposing this. I beg.
---
Alright I’ll try that. I’ll probably wait till tomorrow cause legendary event has my attention ATM
---
This should all have been in the game at launch.
---
It's just a title screen...
---
My thing is... We've had a few of these utility items (Fridge, collection, Scrap kits, and repair kits)
---
And they're almost borderline useless if you play the game.
---
So it'd have to be a sharp turn to get into concern .....
---
I may take a look at doing a PC mod w/that.
---
Was thinking the same thing about a No (PA Helm) when I saw this thread
---
End of March is not far from here. 
---
I think they will delay it one more time until June or July.
---
The higher end houses in ESO are *purely cosmetic*. They add no utility compared to cheaper houses, or a house you can get for free. 
---
Before responding to more threads like this, I recommend you check out a few key terms to develop an understanding of them: 
---
1. aggressive
---
2. monetized/monetization
---
3. cosmetic
---
4. utility
---
Other things 😏
---
It’s the little things that count
---
I joined one earlier with just me and a seemingly stealth commando guy, ended up being pylon for all 3 and killing the sheepsquash myself with an AAE Gatling Plasma Splitter, got a nice looking pair of 1 star instigating knuckles ... :-/
---
100%
---
I can see this a possibility, I used to play everyday and now I haven't touched the game in over a month. There's just not enough content, nor enough solo content to keep the game entertaining. I'll probably come back for Wastelanders, but if it falls short I wont ever return
---
I was playing FO4 survival and just fought off a bunch of super mutants. Hadnt saved in about an hour, bumped into a car and I guess stubbed my toe so hard it killed me. I avoid cars like super mutant suiciders now.
---
Everyone seeks an explosive, bloodied, instigating, executioners, anti armor, even mutants or some others I'm overlooking .... No rolling pins or Spears and so forth. They can definitely distinguish from bad weapon combos to actually useful ones ..
---
Hi overlooking .... no rolling pins or spears and so forth. they can definitely distinguish from bad weapon combos to actually useful ones .., I'm dad.
---
Most of the complaints i see about atom challenges is lack off lifetime ones to do or dailys being uncompletable bethesda saying there gonna rework after the last time they did makes it seem as though there gonna make it worse and utility items arent bad except when they shouldve been in the base game
---
Well I pegged you wrong. Not ashamed to admit when I'm off and this time I missed it by a mile. I'll even upvote you.
---
lol get the fuck outta here. ESO also had $50 companions that let you access the bank and a merchant anywhere you want. CONVENIENCE ITEMS MY GUY
---
It doesn't matter if you've read it. This sub is insignificant. It makes up a tiny portion of the player base.
---
BGS has much more concrete evidence to base the demand off of .....
---
Sales and usage.
---
I’m trying to get my girlfriend to allow me to do this side by side tv setup but she’s adamantly against it.
---
Aren't they? They announced at e3 we would have wastelanders this fall. Now we get to wait 6 more months. And yes, we can keep pointing at the bad bugs they aren't bothering to fix. Somebody has to, otherwise people like you will think they're doing a great job when they are failing to fix nasty bugs.
---
Spears can be pretty bad ass in the right hands FYI.
---
Gasp! 
---
That's not how business works!
---
The people who complain about the lifetime ones don't realize that once the "Kill X with Y weapons" complete, they roll over. They don't want to check facts. They want to complain
---
How do you even use scrip? I know its for the legendary vendors.
---
I like fallout, I like fallout 76, and I got the fridge. I'm gonna like what I like, you're gonna dislike what you dislike, but comments about people's wife's boyfriends isn't constructive.
---
That is what I would want
---
It's borderline even more useless. Especially if it operates on the time scale of say..... The collectron.
---
I said there would be disappointment lol...I was not failed...
---
You've got some good reasoning 👍 I found the story was interesting at the start and I was keen to learn more. Was a little lack luster towards the end but the basic premise of 76 was a good idea. Plus since you know a lot of the places IRL, it could be like a trip down memory lane!
---
##😭
---
Hahaha! Sweet stuff. Good build. I love your play style!
---
i wish we could serve it ourselves, i have a lot of free cpu cycles, more than they do anyway
---
I have one of those and it is really fun.
---
Yeah I’m level 84 on NW I want it too 😬😂
---
Can you tell me what problem or solution any of the current utility items solve?
---
Sure, point at them. Don't pretend they aren't doing things though.
---
I'm not disagreeing with that. My suppressors spear comes out of pocket every now and then, but compared to a deathclaw gaunt, meathook, mmg ... There's an order of superiority ... I just used spear as an example sorry ^ just on a rant right now ^
---
Some of us paid more via tricentennial edition and such :/ so its even more dissapointing to be run over by the cash grabbing brahmin that it has become.
---
I bet it’s more than just bugs. I think it is going to be a pretty sizable expansion from the looks of it.
---
Cool I think I’ll check it out :) thanks for helping me decide aha
---
You don’t want a monotone voice simply reading to you and not adding anything to the conversation? Sounds like you have poor taste!
---
i’m still waiting for the day we are able to turn our characters into ghouls.
---
Oh yep! Thank you for the advice my friend!
---
you lucky person....
---
You might be onto something there.
---
Repair kits were introduced in patch 8.5 and then in patch 9 they fixed the axe/nerfed the 200% boost on items... I know people were losing their minds over repair kits in general but I wasn’t aware that they were using the 200% repair boost as justification for their complaints. That’s insane to me.
---
I hope those people are happy and it was worth it for weapons like the chainsaw, drill, and ripper to do a whopping 2 damage now. Even better now that survival was canned so who would even care if it still boosted damage anymore.
---
might take a few days to scrip all that bloodied heavy weapon garbage :D j/k
---
Your safe area of expectation is in the dirt well below what they have already confirmed would be in the expansion. It's a brand new story mode that continues and replaces the original one we currently have.
---
The very introduction of those items brought backlash. They could very easily have to justify those decisions to their management, and selling those kits in bundles of other things is a super easy way to manipulate the metrics to make it look like you made the right decision.
---
They probably don't give a shit about what we think at all honestly. If they did they wouldn't have lied about it to begin with.
---
They're trying to monetize your OXYGEN!?
---
Ask in the fallout subreddit, all you're gonna get here is "the game is 10000x better now than on release".
---
What they don't tell you is that they're only talking about server stability. The world is still vastly empty, the AI is horrible, there's no challenge, the quests are basically listening to people that already died while guiding you around the map, and the shooting is clunky because theres a small amount of latency. When you reach the endgame, the only thing you do is farm for OP weapons you don't really need, because again, no monster in this game poses a challenge over AI/pathing issues.
---
Buy it if you must, but id wait for the wastelanders release to see if they actually improve something.
---
I approve hahaha
---
If it is true I will finally have a good reason to dump this game and never come back to it.
---
I spent like 600 worth and got nothing but crap 3\* guns.  Now I am over encumbered, camp stash is full, and the legendary machine doesn't have enough scrip to sell my stuff back.
---
Lol. Yeah BGS! These useless items should be free!
---
Hahahahaha. If you NEED a fridge you should find a new game to play. 
---
If you need the collectron? You REALLY need to play something else. I can outpace my collectron, and actually get stuff I need...... After walking 5 feet out of my camp.
---
He's only there because I like his sense of humour .... The stuff he collects? I leave for players.
---
As I presumed as well. But I wish for a dev to see my input. I like the idea of higher script options that omit the weaker effect weapons / armor. Or delete the purveyor and make it a terminal that links directly to the Reddit market place. (That was just a joke)
---
"I killed the scorchbeast queen and all I got was this lousy t-shirt"
---
Make it a super rare drop from her
---
What's the state of the player base?
---
Is there an explanation as to why I don’t experience this then?
---
Lol we have been spent 60$ a year ago &amp; the game still buggy as hell ..so Beth should be shy and let the private server at least buy-one time
---
1,3,4,8,10 are things that should have been available since day one. 12 is just a fix that also should have been implemented way earlier.
---
Disappointment for a bargain!  Nice!
---
Some of us like to be romanced from time to time. Also the fact that some of click right through is no indication that we all do.
---
I uninstalled after the ITV. Time to wait some more
---
I do too for different reasons, it is just a bad RPG. I try to see it more as a really complex visual novel instead.
---
I  had that bug yesterday it was awesome went and filled up on ore lol
---
If you like playing, you should slowly start working on another char to have different kind of build. It will take a while to level it up to 50-70 when you can take all gear and have most/all needed perks, but it's handy to play with another char a while. Allows you to get more caps too, carry more stuff ect ect.
---
But for your current char, you can quite easily boost your damage by switching into junkies heavy weapons. Junkies build is fairly easy to set up, you won't need to take full 5 addictions for max effect, you can start easy by 2-3, and the playstyle is practically the same. Actually, with heavy weapons and little need for agility, doing full 5 addictions is probably very trivial. Yeah go with that straight on 5.
---
And get rid of any TS weapons. Unless you are fully perked to damage(like total of &gt;50%), which most players aren't, you want AAE or AA FFR as generic weapon instead, even with perks that increase your armor penetration). Armor eats a lot of the nominal damage you are producing. With high amount of damage the effect is lesser. For example when I got my  quad explosive assult rifle, I tested it againts fog crawlers, with 100 or 130 DR. My AAE handmade made exactly twice as much damage as the assult rifle. Now handmade does do little bit more damage than assult or combat, but the difference is not that large. It was all about that AA. I had 30% damage on auto rifles, max anti tank perk and I always use the highest pen magazines. It was so sad because I thought it would be cool weapon I got from Purveyor, but it's way too wasteful on ammo.
---
If you are familiar with heavy weapons already then you know to stick to .50 cal and minigun. I guess gatling gun can be useful too but to me it's felt such a starter heavy gun that you'd want to upgrade after a while.
---
Don't want to upset China and get banned in their country
---
They dont. 
---
They sell what sells well. The idea that they would inflate the sales numbers of something in an attempt to sell more is just flat out stupidity. 
---
Hey  boss. These didn't see well. But if we lie and say they did, and keep putting the labour hours into them..... They might. 
---
Or we could focus our man power on what makes us money....
---
Nope... Let's try the lie and waste money option.
---
And and improvement to the event notifications which can't even be called content.
---
Man, you guys really fucking sugar coated the changes in the Atom Shop. I don't remember seeing many threads here on reddit asking for anything you listed. When it came to a working fridge, it wasn't "Hey Bethesda, charge us for a working fridge please", it was "A fridge would be cool to put my stuff in".
---
You decided to make it something the community had to pay for. The monetization of this game has gotten worse over time and your wordsmithing to basically negate what Pete Hinez said is gross.
---
I’ve heard this theory and variations of the same but can only share my own experience.  Before the 5pm EST rush today made interacting with her a chore I blew through 2500 scrip.  All three characters are dressed exclusively in unyielding armor and only carry bloodied weapons.  I spent 1000 on 3 star armors.  I received 1 unyielding armor.  I then jumped servers with my second character.  I spent the next 1000 on 3 star ranged weapons.  I received no bloodied weapons.  I jumped again and spent a little over 500 on a mix of weapons and armor.  No bloodied.  No unyielding.
---
They have not said, and im 50/50 on it. If they were going to add more you would have thought hey would have done it with Wild Appalachia. That said with this dlc being as large as it is they could easily add a bunch and not even have to try. So it's definitely maybe.
---
&gt; Our goal for players who purchase this service
---
lost me there
---
With Fallout 4 did you like building the settlements and exploring the world after you finished the main story? If so, then you need to buy this game, you will love it.
---
The icon was always blank. No idea why they haven’t removed it or added it?
---
If you’re a bloodied build unyielding is a must.
---
I got an anti armour ultracite gat by placing my camp next to a behemoth spawn, it's great.
---
honestly i think it carries over to in world legendary drops too
---
Bloodied is highest dps.  Junkie is close but not quite as good.
---
Melee or rifles.
---
If I said "I don't drink", that isn't mean saying "I've never drank." Tenses are hard to understand, so I forgive you.
---
20$ a month is insane
---
like knight already said, servers arent cheap BUT you have to tell people before they buy your product how much you charge them for servers.   
---
I have also played, and enjoyed, WOW and old runescape. I played them when they had no MTX and you only paid your sub fee, and i loved this system. I knew how much I had to pay and what i got for it. 
---
Tbh. I havent seen much new content, epecially when I see the insane prices they charge. I would never buy cosmetics the price of an full DLC for other games. The only bigger thing they released is a Battle royale, which nobody asked for, just to cash in on this crowd too. 
---
I also dont feel like this game is really a good multiplayer game, since the only multiplayer parts have been patched in later and work poorly. My guess is, that Bethesda made this game online only, so they have an excuse for there MTX. Also, im 100% sure there will never be reall mod support, just mods Bethesda sells you like they started in there other games. 
---
Im pretty sure they are testing the waters here, to see with how much crap they can get away with in there next elder scrolls and full Fallout installment. 
---
I hope I am wrong, but looking at the rest of the AAA industry, I dont think  so.
---
Honestly, I stopped playing for a couple of months to play other games and came back a week or two ago when I found they fixed AA for energy weapons. Been playing it non-stop since. Taking a break allowed me to really enjoy the game again.
---
I want that old possum shirt they showed in inside the vault
---
Public servers will be as full as they are now as long as there are at least 24 people on them ;)
---
The privates will be adjusted to fit different needs, with some trading servers where any activity besides trading is not allowed, because it takes the trading spots. There will be PvP servers and majority of PvPers will migrate there, making being attacked a rarer thing for pacifists. There will be RP communities where you'll be able to log in, expect your friends camps to be there etc.
---
Private servers are glorious news.
---
Bloodied handmades imo. Or explosive PA heavies
---
*got downvoted even when I put “in my opinion” lol. Gg
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave
---
I grew up not far from Harpers Ferry myself, and one of the things I love is they really got the feel of the area down. When you are out exploring it really feels like you are in West Virginia in my opinion.
---
Thank you! Which melee weapons and rifles?
---
Welcome to let’s bitch about everything no matter what my friend lol that’s FO76 in a nutshell.
---
I was trying to launch at the queen, and I was so tired that I completely missed the prime fissure site, and aimed it at the other one next to  Watoga. 
---
I laughed, then just went to bed.
---
You forgot the “ ass ass tiddies tiddies ass n tiddies”
---
That makes sense. Considering they have the infrastructure probably 1000 atoms than.
---
Recently discovered the questline that leads to that event, only after lvl 100 lol, and started the event. Event successful, got the fixer plan right away. Didn't realize at first it was rare!
---
Well from my personal experience, I've gotten just as much out of FO76 that I did from 3, NV, and 4. It's been completely worth it at $60. For $20? You should be playing it right now.
---
thank you for your feedback and experiences, we need as much input as possible!
---
Yup that’s why I didn’t bitch about it lol.
---
&gt;Very different, am I right :)
---
Do you think it isn't? What software are you developing that you feel is comparable in supporting to developing free expansions and updates for a game? Why would they even keep making updates if they weren't making money off them? Love for the game, I suppose - but that doesn't pay rent.
---
Servers. Servers need work. Get that fixed and that's a HUGE step forward.
---
I hear you, and understand. In the end, part of the point of the purveyor grind is to make sure people that work hard and don’t give up eventually are rewarded, and fly by night dice rollers are less likely to be rewarded to the same degree. Just my opinion though, I kinda like it.
---
"Do you like building various settlements over big wide areas? Then you'll LOVE building just one in a relative small place."
---
Lol
---
I'd just like to be able to use my high end gear without constantly getting a game breaking damage bug. If that finally got fixed, I'd probably be able to find SOME way of entertaining myself with what's already in the game. But until that gets fixed I don't have a reason to come back
---
Ah, sweet. What is recommended as a 2nd and/or third star for them? What PA heavy weapon and stars?
---
I can agree to that. But since we don't have the full information, it's hard to debunk it as a PR statement.
---
Are you new to how atom shop pricing works?
---
Agreed. If not there should be 4* or ultra elite monsters monsters with guaranteed 3*
---
Well statistics are a really fun and deceptive way to lie with numbers. The odds of anything happening, no matter how specific, is either 0% or 100%
---
Not a damn thing wrong with it, now we are all deaf.
---
Been an issue since 3 months after launch, along with fast traveling while "ovencumbered" because the game forgets your armor and perks when you die..
---
The repair kits have come in clutch a few times. Though I only ever use the improved ones from the queen. I can see how they would be useful. Same with scap kits. They are more for the real casual players, makes it easier for them.
---
How do sneak attacks work in PVP and how do I prevent them?  The biggest annoyance is that the explosive lasers are able to 1-shot me even after I've taken anti-vats measures (like stealth boy and sitting behind a fence).  So it can't be VATS criticals.  They only way I can see them getting those damage numbers up is either sneak attack or the duppers are really good at headshots.
---
Gonna be shouting this on mic EVERY Mole Mama pull this evening, thanks for reminding me
---
Its called the "foot in the door" technique and its exceedingly common in business practices.
---
You start with something light that everyone brushes off, and gradually you add more items in that are more useful, more necessary, etc.
---
Its a strategy that works well because, as you can see from this post and some of the people replying to it, a lot of people discard the potential impact of it because "its no big deal!"
---
Have no doubt that being accepting of this is just opening the door further to them.
---
I do think it will hurt the longevity of the game and it’s player base in the long run. 
---
I get from a corporate perspective on wanting to milk players dry, but I can’t help but think that they’d make more money in the long run by providing a game people want to actually play and pay for.
---
I personally blame them more for exploiting players rather than the players for giving in since I’m sure a lot of them are young
---
I'd like areas hardcapped at max 30 be hardcapped at min 90
---
There's no reason why we can't host on our hardware and mod it for free like plenty of other survival games like ark, Conan and rust
---
Only 650 atoms
---
Guessing they were planning to release a commie bundle at some point and it got added to the game by accident. Related to Wastelanders maybe?
---
Got a few decent ones, but I already have multiple god roll weapons (from previous purveyor sales) for my main character. Got 3 amazing Fixers that I will transfer to my 2nd alt. Still no luck on my white whale, Level 50 Instigating Grognak's Axe to replace the Level 40 that I have been using for 10 months. The quest continues.
---
Cool. Well if you add waxapple in game, I tend to announce on the lfg channel on the linked discord in batches of three
---
I'm well aware of the foot in the door technique....
---
However utility items have gotten more useless ... Not more useful and necessary..... Kind of the opposite direction there...
---
Christ.... Most people own the collectron because he's hilarious.... Not because he collects a small amount of useless junk.
---
China had to go and fuck it up for everyone. Communism is no longer cool.
---
I feel like it could go either way. There might seem to be a lot more griefers as many people stay hidden in private servers while griefers are looking for a fight. Making the ratio of griefers higher in pve. On the other hand maybe mods can make pvp more functional and enjoyable, which would maybe lead to griefers heading to private pvp servers. I don’t really know about private servers so forgive any ignorance.
---
Glad I could help! Enjoy!
---
faster fire rate/ explosive for second star, and reduced weight for 3rd star
---
Obviously Bethesda feels the product wont be ready by December. 
---
I really dont understand this community. People rightly complained about Fallout 76's launch being a rushed buggy mess, but now people are complaining about how Bethesda decided to push back a release to iron out whatever is wrong with it.
---
Survival will come back with the private servers.
---
True - it's about being severely over encumbered  while this sale is on and maybe a week after. Can only return 3x 3\* weapons per day or return 10x 2\* weapons per day. A good 3\* is great but a bad one is useless. Especially if you also get the 250dr which is a third star.
---
I'm very content with my poodle skirt, but I'd love to see some accessories.
---
I have no idea I was so wildly excited to be a stealthy sneaky snake, and my vision was dashed. The smg is really one of the only weapons where a suppressor actually makes sense.
---
With so much coming out in the next month or so, I might take a break from Fo76 until wasteland does come
---
My VE90 10mm SMG wonders the same thing...
---
Oh okay, thank you i didnt know, sorry
---
Nice! Thank you. If weight isn’t an issue. What would you recommend then?
---
Yup fridge is worse version of a perk or backpack and you have to go to your stash for it.
---
Collectron...  it’s nice if you want a junk extractor, but I’m not buying it mostly for fear of getting faction based ones after I shell out for a plain one.
---
Same for me on repair kits
---
Scrap kits I threw in my stash lol.  I rarely have a problem being overloaded on junk.  It’s usually food and grenades weighing me down
---
I consider this a shots fired post however.   Food canning and ammo conversion are going to be atom shop items for sure now.
---
I just have not gotten a weapon I use daily from the purveyor..  I have been playing for months and would not enjoy the game using those weapons... I have 2 handmades and 5 levers from Reddit that make the game so much more fun + a handful of melee weapons and others that I'm choosing not to list all atm...  I would like to see an update to the purveyor to make everyone happy ^ I feel like there's so much hate circulating the game that can be reduced. Instead I go up and down 30k caps within hours over the market and have weapons that can blow people away... Just need in game option for that
---
Awesome ! One of the main reasons I wanna check it out aha
---
I think this time we might also get some kind of Cristmas event, too.
---
Don't forget something like GTA5 Online, where you can play online on their servers alone with the solo setting.
---
"This game is dying." - Literally anyone, at some point, about any game that has ever existed.
---
You are fucking deluded if you think it will be:
---
A. A one time purchase
---
B. Purchasable with atoms
---
It will be something like $10-15 a month because amazon charge them monthly to keep the servers running and they have to make a profit
---
A bot that collects some scrap for you; Pay to Win they call it. Try being an honest PVP player when everyone is out buying duped legacy weapons and raid armor.
---
Maybe that is a different topic altogether. I don't know. I just think it is a more important issue than a refrigerator.
---
Yeah, I dont know how often it looks at what, perhaps sometimes it checks your third weapon in inventory and gives you the 2nd star legendary effect and looks at weapon #12 in your stash and gives you that weapon type or whatever. That is still technically RNG. One thing I use almost exclusively on my Main character (level 250) is a Powerfist and I almost NEVER get one rolling melee weapons. So really it's hard to test, we'd have to have so much fucking data that it is all speculation at this point. But I do notice that it seems to favor things you like to use now and then, effects included (just not powerfists? lol).
---
Creating updates for "free" is completly normal. A little example:  We have  a company here that does software for chimney sweepers. Sounds simple, but really istnt. The software is used to manage the whole business and things are constantly changing,   escpecially Laws. When you buy the software it has a fixed price and you get updates for the next lets say 2 years, for "free". The updates are part of this price, and when the companys need more money, well, they have callculated wrongly. But they cant just charge you suddenly for implemneting stuff from changed laws, because it would be agains the terms of the agreement.  
---
A lot of software is distributed that way, escpecially when its about fixing seciurity risks and stuff.
---
I mean at this point i dont really care anymore got like 8 pipe weapons and 3 broadsiders
---
Nuclear winter level for that character
---
Your nuclear winter rank
---
faster reload, or +50 damage resistance when aiming.
---
But you’d want to avoid a bloodied weapon with a +250 dr when reloading, but this specific third legendary effect glitches out bloodied weapons.
---
Every one who disagrees with me is a shill!
---
Nuclear Winter level
---
That's you nuclear winter rank for that character.
---
This subreddit seems to be one of those ones where you either worship the ground Todd walks on or despise the ground Todd walks on and if you're in neither of those groups, be prepared to be downvoted into the dirt.
---
$1 a month for the first month, $5 the next month on that ms thing to beat it. $6 for a game is pretty good these dsys.
---
I hope it wasn't 250 DR?
---
It was my wife's idea. Started a few years ago when we wanted to play skyrim at the same time.
---
That sucks, bro. Maybe try to submit a ticket. If not and you're on PC I can help you out with some gear and shit on your new guy, just PM me
---
Yeah I'd say the repair kit is the best of all the utility items and it was actually the first
---
inon zur
---
You would think making the main game a free service would be beneficial enough in people buying Atom Shop items. If the vendor system showed me anything it’s that people spend a LOT there.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Purveyor_Murmrgh
---
You can find a lot of the game from googling "something fandom".
---
Didnt even think of that but yeah, that is also a really good example.
---
People in here talk as if Bethesda has no other choice but to charge, which is ridiculous, especially considering we already paid full price for the game, offline play should have been a base option.
---
Spike armour and Cage armour, it's right there on dead raiders, just lemme strip them nude and wear i for myself! Is that so much to ask for!
---
Exactly. That's the idea behind PR statements. Could be true, could be BS. It is most of the time. But you can never be 100% sure. And they use that against you.
---
My dad could be working at Bethesda and I could have all the Fixers and you can't prove that I don't :\^)
---
Global events like the Clean Appalachia will have to include private servers in the counts or they will probably fail. It will be the death of game wide events like this. Modded private servers ould unbalance the challenge. So..I don't know.
---
If ammo conversion works on the same timescale as the collectron? Useless. 
---
I can out craft it in minutes.
---
Ok @Bethesda Why give us a November/4th qtr release date for Wastelanders if you already knew it was most likely impossible? To get us to keep playing in anticipation? New events??? Whats the point if you have them on a timer where more than half never show up except in extremely rare moments. You literally mention in the same damn posting that private servers are coming to those that can afford to pay and then say how you want to make sure you don't offer an unfair advantage to players who are spending money in the atom shop?!? How bout this Bethesda us up till now loyal fans of the series and the company that was once Bethesda in our minds will stop buying into your shit lies and your bait and switch tactics and you can just shut up till you actually have something on the fucking plate!(And to think I stood up for you when you gave me that plastic bag this time last year for $300)  *Spit!
---
I'm sad that it won't be out until next year but if it means it'll be better and have less of a chance to have major issues. I'll accept it I cant wait for this new chapter.
---
Except we've seen this post every single time Bethesda does something that gets a bunch of people talking about leaving. How many times do you have to make a joke before it's been heard so many times that it isn't funny any more? It was semi humorous the first time. Now it just looks like some people on this thread would still eat it up if Bethesda fed them literal shit.
---
Well, it does make sense the "private" servers are going to require some kind of payment. Games like this never give out server software to players, so Bethesda needs to run them.
---
I'm hoping that there's more to private servers than just private servers. Also, hopefully modding for them isn't as far off as it sounds.
---
You DO NOT need the fixer plans to get legendary  versions from the purveyor.  I dont have the plans for it and got a legendary version today.
---
So it's all BS except for the one in front of our eyes? How convenient for the Tin Foil Hat Brotherhood.
---
Thank you and everyone else!
---
I thought the lag from 94 came from the incredibly dense vegetation in there. Can't be easy loading in so many plants and textures and details
---
Meanwhile, I can't (currently) obtain all the possible legendary drops from events because some level 300 ass who has more time to play than I do has a gun that mows down everything before anyone has a chance to tag the ghoul.
---
But that's the game. That's an advantage to "win" far beyond some repair kit or fridge.
---
It's a answer, not the answer.
---
Thanks, all!
---
Yeah, we get new players every day. They're wanting to see the shitshow. What they find is a good and balanced Survival game where you can just ignore the survival portions if you choose to and play it like a sandbox with friends
---
I feel like those might have been what Bethesda intended for players to use as homes, because initially the game was never going to have a CAMP system
---
Will add tomorrow! Thanks!
---
It's stupid, for a simple reason - check which games will release in Q1 2020.
---
Ever heard of exaggerating? Not that it's far from the truth when you consider mobile and EA games.
---
Ive only ever seen them in suitcases with missiles and crossbow bolts and gamma rounds and syringer ammo... check train stations?
---
Yeah, but, the original theme for 76 sounded so much better than the Nuclear Winter version.
---
I don't think most of the playerbase has left, I still see people from day one playing
---
...Big booty bitches...
---
It’s all waste lol
---
I dont get the whole point of private servers running on Bethesdas servers. I mean, why should I pay for this? Why should I even want this? I thougt we would get peer to peer for modding, with this system it looks like we will get only Bethesdas useless creation club.
---
I said you were cool and you're arguing me with me.
---
Also pretty sure you'll be able to invite your new friends to your private server. I'm gonna make an open market and post to different trade subs so we can have fresh flea markets
---
And that’s exactly why they’re shit and the game lags. Some people are quick to think the game is actually broken but don’t even consider the hardware the game is hosted on.
---
Greatly diminished in number.
---
Also, why do you think this will bring players to the game?
---
Now would certainly be a good time for mods, bring weaker guns/melees up to a closer level with meta weapons without nerfs/rebalances involved. Maybe add some weapons like plasma caster or maybe .45 Pistols from lonesome road/New Vegas. So much can be done in the next 4 to 5 months to polish the game we are all ready playing.
---
Nukeing fissure sites causes queen that drops decent loot based on your level but as long as you get one shot to hit her you don’t have to do anything and can let other people take care of it
---
I'm hoping one time. I mean only one friend of mine plays with me so I'll be using it basically to capture all workshops and run up supplies to sell in public lobbies. If that will be allowed. Monthly isn't bad but I dont know if it's worth it if it's just gonna be me on there. Public lobbies arent toxic on this game for me to need to be solo all the time.
---
Big whoop wanna fight about it??
---
Whoa whoa there, are you maybe... Having fun? Let me remind you how the 5€ worth Scrapbot is just the first sign of Bethesda going full P2W, which only I, thanks to the power of my tin foil hat, can see. /s
---
Scorchbeast queen comes out when you nuke fissure site prime which is in the bog. As you get higher level the queen is the best event to do. It’s a challenge in comparison to sheepsquatch or something like that. And people only nuke 2 places for the most part, sbq or white springs. White springs is full of gouls which you get stabilizers for flux and tons of xp. You just have to wait for them to respawn from time to time. BUT don’t waste flux on fusion cores you can get those for free from the power plants!!! Stable flux sells good at the very least so it’s worth making.
---
That's how you create reasonable doubt. I swear, Reddit is the most gullible place on the internet.
---
Year 1 was pretty much a test, an experiment if you will, to see if the community liked the idea, they didn’t, so they brought back the original idea, but multiplayer
---
Hopefully we can pay with atoms and everyone who plays on our server can chip in to the atom pool.
---
But this is Bethesda...
---
Yeah or good optics really come on Bethesda.
---
Ah, thank you!
---
I find it interesting that Bethesda finally replied to the idea of canning food yesterday, an idea that's probably been floated 50 times now. They'll definitely want to show that they're simply taking directions from the community, under the assumption that we're saying we want to pay for these things, so something to keep in mind when making sky is the limit QOL suggestions.
---
Just put the word in Quotes
---
I have three pieces of armor with poison resist. It’s great I just walk around it the gas gas cloud no problem.
---
Can you link me to the source of those numbers?
---
I haven't seen Bethesda say anything about cross platform
---
Mario Kart, let's go
---
Ill stick around :)
---
You guys from the Tin Foil Hat Club are so much smarter than the rest of us. Of course, how could have I ever ignored such a subtle scheme? /s
---
I sure can see a gullible right now.
---
Oh I waiting for everything to be monetized now stash cards etc. It sounded like warning why make an announcement like the haven't done something like this when we already getting utility items if it wasn't different.
---
I’m not mad...I’m just disappointed.
---
I feel the mods they allow won't be very interesting. They won't allow mods that discourage, or circumvent atom shop purchases.
---
😂😂😂I hadn’t thought about that song in years, it is now in my music library. Thank you good sir
---
oh great, the next idea for an atomic shop item.
---
Given those choices, they made the wrong move.  
---
Look at the publicity Cyberpunk gets vs. The Outer Worlds.   
---
I love Fallout, been playing the series since the first game - but I will play Cyberpunk when it comes out, no question there. The track record of CDPR in terms of quality &amp; content is superior to Bethesda's. And I love Beth games, for all the buggy messes they are and their tendency to turn Fallout more and more into a FPS.
---
Not to forget the abilities to change the XP you'll get from an enemy.... Don't like the idea... it leads (again) to a huge split off the community and balancing issues across the private and public modes.
---
I'm at end-game with my second character now. I can't be bothered to log in unless my friend is on, and I seriously doubt I'll still be entertained in another 5 months.
---
Don't slam the Wooden Shack Door on your way out.
---
I mean you could just not play the game if you dont like it.
---
Soap and water soap and water
---
I'm so disappointed that we're going to have to wait a few more months for Wastelanders. I'll keep playing, but I'm bummed out. I probably won't log in nearly as often.
---
They cant even release the already planned content on time.
---
hit escape a couple of times to dodge the fade out.  If you can't beat em, join em.
---
Or just play it safe and load up Fallout 3
---
No you shouldn't.
---
I think you just need to "learn the plan" to get Fixer drops/rolls.
---
I'd prefer they get rid of hackers in Nuclear Winter before worrying about anything else.
---
I half agree. Not sure I want to faceoff against a lvl 700+ grafton monster.
---
Scrap for scrip to get more scrap to scrip from her  😂
---
Or the people suggesting paid features like 4 posts above. Will not buy the collectron or fridge. i quit the game instead. But still enjoying the shit-show they are delivering.
---
i prefer a delay than having a bug fest TBH
---
Wait? Those who pay for this service? You have to pay for a private server?
---
What better deal could you get!? For 20 bucks why the hell not?
---
I apologise for the bad placement I tried to explain where to put it but he’s not the best
---
I don't think it will happen. You'd have guaranteed high level legendaries......hence a bit of pay to win.
---
The horde event for example is useless for high levels if not for scrip or mules.
---
I don't think you understand what I am saying. 
---
The idea isn't to inflate the numbers of repair kits sold to sell more repair kits, that is stupid.
---
The idea is that if it looks like the community has accepted the sale of repair kits by bundling them with reduced cost atoms packages it looks like the community is okay with them as a whole and greenlights other items that are not cosmetic in the store. 
---
The metrics make it look like community acceptance and the managers in charge of the decision look good on paper to their superiors.
---
Inflating the numbers has little to do with us as consumers at all.
---
Aim the weapon.
---
Another way to monetize the game if you ask me is why they are going with paid private servers. If they thought they could get away with charging you for a peer-peer system they would have.
---
Fallout76 has been a good lesson on what not to do if you want to keep a loyal fan base.
---
Anytime I play nuclear winter I have to listen to it for at least 5 minutes.
---
The shame of this entire thing is Wastelanders was the only reason I wanted to stick around.   I don’t build camps, rarely team up, I’ve done every event 2000 times over and there’s such an anti PvP element driving this game that quite frankly I’ve had enough.
---
I'd love some Science! themed content.  
---
And more stuff for the BOS (and Enclave should get some love, too - not that I care for that bunch). Both seem unloved atm. Maybe because they're going to get lots in Wastelanders, but who knows...
---
I've played both those games and follow them for some time. They are not a good comparison because they are fundamentally different from FO76 and I'll explain why.
---
Ark and CE run on both dedicated (headless) and listen (interfaced) servers and neither are true singleplayer (but can be offline lan). 
---
Basically a listen server has to run both the client graphic interface as well as the network simulation portion of the game. A dedicated server doesn't render any interface, its all raw code which saves a ton on resources.
---
FO76 could theoretically do what Ark/CE does but you're turning your PC/XBOX/PS4 into a listen server which will have to run everything which is a lot more when comparing the two games.  Currently Bethesda servers run all enemy AI, public events, webs of quest/story logic, as well as database communications among other things.
---
Ark/CE does this too, but when you host a listen server, they place a circular tether barrier around the host player and any player that ventures beyond that, gets teleported back to the host or within the tether.
---
FO76 can place a tether around the host player in a listen session as well, however, Ark/CE doesn't have a web of complex quest/story logic thats spread out throughout the map. They don't have much of those systems at all like FO76 does. So FO76 has to design around this and its incredibly difficult to design (and optimize) essentially two games going forward. Dont worry though, when personal private servers come out, you can do this on your own with minor workarounds and a beefy enough PC (basically like ARK/CE).
---
Yeah but from what i have been hearing is that it is possible now and imagine how much money they would save if instead of having 3 different servers for different platforms. Honestly i really dont know not a computer guy. Im sure im wrong.
---
PC's market would fukken crash because of our cheap dupes
---
Your model is unreasonable. 5 dollars for a full server permanently is outrageous. Based on Nitrado prices I would say 10 bucks a month is reasonable based on server size.
---
But if it wasn't controversial, would they still be brave for saying it?
---
Looking forward to it! Got 5 characters with 1000 scrip!
---
Yeah that would be somewhat worse. Though, having your own servers completely ungoverned by their restrictions would open the game up for mods... and we know how much bethesda likes paid-for horse armor. Or god forbid, even fixes for bullshit they've been unable to fix for months despite modders telling them the exact lines of code they have to change. -.-
---
Well i'am pretty sure some poor little kiddo suggested this with the addition "i need to dump my atoms somewhere..." sure you can find it on reddit.  But of course that does not excuse this greed and taking advantage over your customers.
---
All this bitching.   Just move to another game already.
---
Just read npcs next year. Maybe fallout 5 will be out before they throw in the spices this game needs.
---
Verifying which one of us is right is actually quite easy.
---
If Bethesda is speaking the truth and people somehow love spending money on things that should be part of the game, under the guise of "p2c", then why am I not seeing fridges everywhere?
---
More to my point, why do the majority of those camps with collectrons *don't* have fridges?
---
Scorch Beast Queen attracts lots.  
---
Southern part of the mire has always some.  
---
The tunnel (forgot name) is always a hotspot for them.
---
Cross-platform doesn’t mean less servers it means more.
---
Yes but this is not a shitty mobile F2P game.
---
Mine does.
---
The airport is a great spot
---
It is a different topic, and it is still pay to win, it is just pay to win that is against the ToS
---
So u think it would crash? Thought they got rid of all the dupes? Thought i read a couple posts about them taking them out of the system. I've only been on 3 months so wasn't around for it.
---
it sucks crap out of a donkey ass, well at least i won’t be distracted during midterms.
---
It's a dedicated server not a private server. Private server would be self hosted.
---
Honestly the only reason I care about food spoilage was in the interest of selling food, like opening a restaurant but I'm not paying seven dollars to do that.
---
On another note I actually like the repair kits because I do SBQ a lot and as you pointed out, I'm lazy and would rather not go collect crap to repair my weapons and armor
---
 strippers
---
Hi not paying seven dollars to do that.
---
on another note i actually like the repair kits because i do sbq a lot and as you pointed out, , I'm dad.
---
I doubt it, as it is fine when there's a low population server. Also the lag had nothing to do with frame rates, it's input lag and similar.  Fps is fine even in a laggy instance. 
---
Im no expert though.
---
Yes, it looked like proto-ghoul, before the full effects of ghoulification.
---
Like the face looks fairly ghoul but hands are still quite human like.
---
Again. It's hard to get similar items greenlit..... By your superiors.... If they're not actually selling well. Acceptance isn't dollars. 
---
My higher ups wouldn't green light shit, regardless of acceptance, if I couldn't show hard sales data.
---
And don't try telling me people who make decisions wont be able to differentiate between sales and bundled sales...
---
If you want to PVP you could do NW but yeah I get it. They removed survival so what you gonna do?
---
Yes it is the most entertaining way of enjoying this utter shitshow since it's release. Actually a lot more than playing it (and i was really a fan of Fallout games)
---
$7.99 a month.
---
&gt;Creating updates for "free" is completly normal.
---
Maybe in the "chimney sweeper software" industry, but it's certainly not normal in game development. 
---
&gt;The updates are part of this price, and when the companys need more money, well, they have callculated wrongly.
---
Again, that might be how it works in chimney sweeping software, but it's not how game design works - or has ever worked, for that matter. No one is going to buy a game for $300 with the promise that it'll be supported for a decade or whatever.
---
You say useless but I haven't had to make a single repair the traditional way since repair kits were introduced and the junk kits are the only way to run raids without risk of loss.
---
These things are game changing, even if in subtle ways.
---
Oh my bad didnt realize that. I assumed each platform had its own set of servers and if cross play was enabled that it would mean hose servers that are normally almost empty would be filled up meaning less servers. Sorry im not a computer guy. Very cool thanks for the info
---
&gt; and it's like ... 69 hours between item respawns.
---
It's not. You have to pick up 60 other world items before the first item respawns for you.
---
And clearly you represent 100% of the playerbase. Despite the fact the majority of camps don't have fridges.
---
I love this game, and it's been immensely fun, bit I'm tired of getting angry every week because of some atomic shop bullshit and just thinking of how many hours of my life (which no one will give me back) of funless farming I'd need just to get a fkn fridge or some random fallout4 outfit that should've been there from the start. Or thinking how many ways they'll try to get my money or push me in to buying stuff because it's convenient or make my experience less grindy or frustrating. It's not fun anymore.
---
Thanks for all the fun but it's not worth it, that last update on the atomic shop and it's vagueness just made me decide to uninstall once and for all :(
---
Don't forget the *wonderful* online play in Rdr2...
---
Nope, not after today
---
It helps on a slight occasion. But I'm constantly surrounded by enemies when I get into buildings.
---
This is excellent! Thank you for the transparency! Please take your time with Wastlelanders; more developers should have the guts to do this!
---
I'm very excited for the Private Worlds, too; hopefully, the ability to make it persistent is possible for the game's systems, which would make this a truly epic addition!
---
Come on man don't rail on my boy Juicehead he doesn't have much of a slant
---
Plot twist, it was never cool
---
Well at least I can support my claims with facts, and only speak for myself.
---
Sorry old chap, I don't understand your banter.
---
It's just that they realised how overpriced their Fallout 4 assets are. If put real features like a fridge and collecton behind a paywall. Yes most people want that. Thats not business practise, it's extortion.
---
I get that its just a title screen, but its something you have to stare at alot, especially if you get put in a queue. I really liked it when it was introduced, but it has burned way past it's prime. Id be happy even if they reverted to the original.
---
You are not wrong. Adventure mode will be a true wasteland and this community will turn sour on itself as people start gatekeeping
---
Pay 2 win!
---
I run with bloodied heavy weapon and rifleman build (non automatic). No power armor but a full sentinel armor. For me it is all about maxing out one shot damage so every perk is pretty much damage perk. I run at all times with this loadout: BE handmade, BE lever action rifle, QE Harpoon, B25 tesla rifle, BE gatling plasma, BE railway rifle, BE laser rifle, TSE laser rifle and for big bosses I carry one of these depending on the ammo situation: BE lmg/BE 50 cal or BE minigun.
---
Some of the weapons and damages for reference: https://imgur.com/gallery/QDI4CV1
---
I can support mine as well. Literally just go from camp to camp and check for fridges.
---
Spoiler: you won't find that many. Definitely not as many as collectrons.
---
Did you buy it? If so how much did you pay? I think I sold mine recently for ~9k. Couldn’t find much use for it.
---
Okay. But you're repairing the non traditional way BECAUSE you have them .... Not because they are necessary or provide an advantage.... Outside of raids? I guess..... Because raid junk is... Somehow valuable?
---
I've used a bunch too.....because I've got them. I also have a junk stash that make them useless.....
---
That's just like, your opinion.
---
My brother got it as a drop and gave it to me.
---
Even tho it's delayed, I'm super excited about the upcoming patch and even if it's slowly getting better atleast Bethesda is putting the effort in to show us they do care. Thanks Devs, you guys deserve mad Respect! Now change the script cap to a good 500 per day! Lol
---
Are they actually taking away atom challenges or are people being dramatic?
---
Cross platform does exist but not in games like this. PC has hackers and consoles dont want any part of it.
---
No the OP is correct here.
---
Oh nice. Well at least you know some poor fool will pay 9k for it (I bought for 10K so I am the bigger fool haha)
---
I'm not sure why they would specifically make a statement about this now, knowing it would create a PR shitstorm, unless they were planning to release items with actual utility? It makes it looks like they're trying to get ahead of something. I mean they've just released these things up till now and most people agreed it's no big deal since they're hardly even useful anyway, so no statement was needed.
---
*** Two-shot and Bloodied Gatling Plasmas, and a Vanguard's Sentinel piece of armor (leather, but shh) are my best rolls out of 1150 scrip spent today. None of them are useful to me, though I'm gonna try out the BGP, but as soon as I have room in my stash they're getting vendored. 
---
To balance all that, I also got a lot of crap like a Berserker's Radium Rifle and more Mutant Slayer's armor than I know what to do with. I can stop farming legendaries for a while and still have enough to turn in every day to easily hit my 150 max.
---
You don’t think they have a price in mind? They come out next week..
---
It's my opinion you can check if people bought fridges by checking if they have fridges?
---
How old are you?
---
There never was a cosmetic only promise. There was a no pay to win promise, and they're keeping. Stop fearmongering. Nobody is gonna get bought scrip/stash upgrades
---
I do enjoy it.
---
I don't see how it makes sense to buy 3 star ranged weapons just because they are half off.  Two star ranged weapons are half off also, right?  The first and second star effects on ranged weapons are so much better than the third that buying more two star weapons with the discount is the correct play.
---
Maybe if 90 percent reduced weight effect didn't go to shit when you start adding mods to the weapon.
---
I hope not. I despise that obnoxious armor. Only time I can think I'd like it would be NW.
---
Cause they had to.... 
---
They don't communicate enough and it's rage.... They want to add more utility items? And they don't communicate that? Even more rage.
---
Not a chance this would happen. Sony were bad enough with mods, let alone this.
---
Was it announced that private servers u will have to pay for? Keeps getting mentioned and i havent seen it?
---
I had unusually large amount of traffic to my vending when Purveyor opened her sales. And I mainly sell junk and such. It's not even weekend yet and the Purveyor sales runs nearly a week.
---
Once you learn them you can get them as legendaries from Murmgh. AFAIK she's the only way to get one.
---
Variety, maybe. You have similar weapons which can be silenced. The same reason the multipurpose axe has no mods.
---
You can just use mine.      You’ll have to pick a lock to get to it though....
---
You have to do more than one shot on her, you need to get a decent chunk of damage if you want to get loot off her. You'll get the event rewards either way, but her loot is different. That doesn't mean you have to kill her. If you summon her just make sure there are a decent number of high level players also look in this forum for exactly where to place the nuke for maximum damage.
---
goteem
---
I want my "Sleepytime"
---
I would agree thats what worries me im a console player and feel pc is rampant with mods or cheats.
---
It worked so far with me
---
Correction....
---
Some of the 1/3 of the platforms Fallout is played on have the resources to do this.
---
Can pretty much bet on it coming back. I think everything that was "limited" has made a return so far.
---
Yes that is the way those outfits work if you are rewarded one you get them all it's not a bug
---
You dont lose junk when you die in a vault raid. Quit your bullshit
---
Don't you know? YoU cAn EaRn AtOmS fOr FrEe. I also like how they label the update as "free". So kind of you Beth for finishing your incomplete game 1.5 years after release FoR fReE. This game is a lost cause. Let it die already and move on to actually good games. And yes I played this game since launch (lvl 250) and no, I didn't like it because I played other online rpg games that are actually polished, challenging and have a meaningful end-game/story.
---
Sorry thought i read they were open to it and the ball was in Bethesda's court. Maybe i misunderstood what i read.
---
Me either, I just assumed that all those plants would be hard to process but I don't know what I'm talking about
---
I’ve been on a similar lucky streak. We should enjoy it while it lasts.
---
All five though? That's awesome.
---
Hope you're right... I don't like seeing this game get so much hate.
---
BGS was in no way vague about what 76 was going to be.
---
The problem was that people ignored that and wanted it to be something else.
---
Yes it is, because 1) you are just, as any tin foil hat theory that has ever existed, supporting your claims with omniscient, universal statements that would require such an effort to be proven right or wrong that one just ends  giving up, 2) the fact they don't show it in THAT camp does not imply they haven't purchased it, 3) differently from you I am old enough to distinguish between facts and opinions. 
---
For instance, whatever you just said, until proven and backed up with explicit evidence, is an opinion. The fact I bought the fridge is a fact.
---
Wastelanders got pushed back so it looks like we are.
---
No its not. Just release the server sdk and we can host our own.  That was the standard before they realized they can charge console players for it.
---
Time to get that tattered field jacket.
---
To put it basically they’d have to have host console severs which are just Xbox/ps/pc then they would have mixed servers which would be Xbox+pc/ps+pc/Xbox+ps/xbox+ps+pc. And all though this wouldn’t necessarily mean more servers, it would require more upkeep and debugging since cross-platform is still a new thing.
---
The message is people love to build and collect things and even better let’s make items available to purchase!
---
Fuck the game features or stability it’s all about the $$$
---
Oh no! They locked out modders from modifying their property?
---
Oh if its still a fucking mess after this long delay you may as well just stop caring about the game right then and there because not only does it kill all hope for the future of the game, it will also be the topic of every youtube video, gaming article, reddit post, etc just bashing the shit out of the game (and rightfully so). So we should all save ourselves from feeling the pain too.
---
Would be hard considering atoms USD Ratio is already absurd. They are more likely to make getting the atoms harder (farming 200 atoms, 2 USD costed me about 4 hours of game time every week).
---
That's actually good advice if you're looking to keep the weapons. For some reason people only want Three Star when you're selling them
---
Well I'm glad we can agree that everything in the game as is stands now is not pay to win. But I do agree with your second paragraph, the more utility items they add in that sense will creep the argument over to p2w slowly but surely.
---
Rightfully so? How rightfully so. 
---
The game world is their fucking intellectual property.
---
Oh that sucks, i had no intention playing on private servers i like meeting different people, it amazes me how diverse a single server can be. Right now have no interest in mods but would like bethesda to add a couple features like changing the load out of perk cards like pc has already.
---
Thats the standard on pc. Why would i pay for a server when i have multiple pc and can just host my own.
---
This is a great idea.
---
They should put this in for all clocks, not just make a new clock for the feature.   All clocks should accurately display ingame time.
---
It would make my CooCoo more useful than just hanging above the fish lamp and frog in a jar.
---
They need to make the CooCoo clock actually CooCoo too.
---
Thank you for summarising again the same misinformation that has been already pushed by the rest of your colleagues during the past hours.
---
You can go back to being bored now.
---
Boo fucking hoo. 
---
It's their game world. Their service. Their intellectual property. 
---
That's how it works
---
Don't give up - I know how disappointing it can be though.
---
And people who arent dont realize that wasnt a thing until they realized they can charge console gamers for it.  Being able to host your own servers on pc has been standard since the 90s
---
Do U know what day that is in the lore
---
Wow u must be a computer god. Thats cool thank u for explaining it in layman's terms.
---
Bethesda hasn't mentioned any plans for cross platform
---
I heard they were supposed to be possible loot from treasure map locations
---
More of a novice trust haha. But I’ve studied two years of games development and 2 years of computer security so my knowledge is getting there.
---
Oh God, I didn't even think about this. Might seriously considering ghosting on 76 until Wastelanders is out if I have to put up with that menu screen much longer.
---
And after this delay, I'm expecting FO4-tier NPCs and dialogue and fully functional tameable pet and recruitable ~~fodder~~ follower systems.
---
If i dump i do it at train stations in containers, feel like if too many players drop bags that it will clog up the server, i dont know if thats true but feel like it could be a thing.
---
that's a bad comparison. You can host a server from your computer. Many games like 7 days to die allow that. Thats by the way an indy open world minecraft like multi or singleplayer without building or stash limitations.
---
I jumped on borderlands 3 as soon as it released cause I was bored with 76, I am not disappointed. Borderlands is a great game, and hasn’t crashed or glitched once. I also tried their shift key system and think it’s pretty cool. Outer worlds looks good and as well as Cyberpunk 2077 around April.
---
Except the patch goes live on Wednesday
---
You can host all the servers you want ..... On your own already paid for internet service. 
---
You however aren't entitled to host the intellectual property of someone else. It's not your property. It's not your assets. It's not your game service. 
---
You really had to ask that fucking question? 
---
Tell me it became yours when you bought the game....
---
Your worried about title screens when I just spent 1000 scrip across 5 different worlds and got 14 weapons with limb damage thanx bathesda next time I would like a reach around!
---
I mean yeah? Thats pretty standard on pc since the 90s. I have a separate tower i use just for server hosting
---
That is very cool hope u end up with a great career in it if thats what u want. Very cool
---
I have the same problem. I’ve been playing since the free trial and haven’t got a character past level 20. My current character has just hit Level 20 and I’m so determined to keep playing through now.
---
Hopefully I’ll be able to get the main quest finished before Wastelanders!
---
They can just change the prices
---
At the end of the day, a company has to make money. All game content has been free for a full year, so at some point they’re going to have to start charging for things to stay afloat. It seems like Zenimax was letting them sleep on the couch for a year and now they have to start paying rent.
---
I paid $60 to preorder the game, paid nothing to enjoy 1500+ hours of entertainment, so I’m ok with some fees moving forward.
---
I’m not anticipating anything outrageous, just the standard stuff any online game offers.
---
No you're just notn using private in the same context. 
---
When they say private.... They mean not every whiny bitchy entitled asshole can join. Just those the owner/renter chooses
---
That's common though would you rather they release unready content? The fact they delay it shows they care enough to take time to make sure the content is good but it doesnt take a lot of time to add a single quest when assets and scripts for it to be possible are already in game files
---
They said last year when the game released that private servers will be a year away and modding will come in time as well. Calling someone an idiot for saying what’s true is asinine and you should be ashamed of yourself for not only being completely wrong, but for being condescending to someone for no other reason that you like being a complete asshole dick sucker.
---
I think the worst part of that statement was how they worded it like cosmetic would never cut it in terms of profits. However, when one considers how most of the cosmetics they released weren't what the community wanted, the unnecessary limited time availability, the fact that they didn't finally start releasing faction based cosmetics that a large portion of people repeatedly asked for until almost a year after release, and the fact that the raider themed items second set was mostly just a cruddy re-skin of the first set. How did they expect to make money when they didn't really try on that front?
---
&gt;differently from you I am old enough
---
I doubt it. for one because p2convenience isn't the same as cosmetics. people wouldn't just buy a fridge that's meant to be used and store it away because they got bored of its... functionality? it doesn't even make sense. what's more, if p2c is oh, **so** popular, even if some people stored the fridge away, we'd *still* see more of them around than we actually do.
---
but also because this is an obvious, shameless PR stunt. you'd need to be extremely naive, or just pretend to, in order to believe anything Bethesda said. "people LOVE to spend money on repair kits", yeah, I'm sure this statement that goes against every rational conclusion is true. who in their right mind would take anything a company hellbent on profit says at face value?
---
Iron Zur sounds cooler
---
Though by default Inon Zur is a pretty cool name tbh
---
I paid less for Fallout 4 than this utter crap and i got more original content. Dont tell me they need now 250% of the money to deliver 60% of a game. The inflation was not so hard in the last years.
---
Do you mainly play on console? You gotta understand paying for servers wasnt a thing until they realized they can charge console people for it.  Server hosting software  being paired with multiplayer pc games has been standard for decades.
---
Why not?
---
How soon can a new character start to earn script? I tend to waste or just drop excess legendaries
---
Thanks for the support! I’ve got a game on the back burner atm that I hope to finish one day but focusing on website building for now.
---
Hes allowed to have an opinion lol. I agree though, most of the people on here are good folks.
---
I can't justify paying for a private server with the condition the game's in, even if a private server means less lag, so if you're on XBox, you'll be seeing me around.
---
Since day one, except for 3 random times in NW mode, I could hear nobody talk unless they were my friends on a team. No matter what. And people not on my team couldn't hear me either. And being on a temperary team during events, same thing. Nothing fixes it, idk its so sad lol. Even uninstalled/reinstalled the game. Feel like no body else has this issue x.x
---
Right? But without it the game has been a lot smoother and they said it is because they wanna focus more on wastelanders and to improve survival mode before releasing it again. Maybe they will let us have more options for private servers like turning off the passive mode and all that
---
They’re obviously investing more resources into things they can immediately monetize rather than finish the free shit they promised. Keep in mind waste landers was originally the summer expansion and the QoL features were originally part of the nuclear winter expansion. Some of these promises have been postponed 3 times now. Meanwhile there’s nothing left to do in the game but spend money. 
---
Let’s not forget most of things added barely worked (encryptid, project paradise, raids), have been nerfed  to oblivion or otherwise broken intentionally (free range, campfire tales, meat week plans, SBQ fights which used to drop power armor mod plans and serum recipes, anything relegated to public events in general), or rife with unchecked cheaters (NW).
---
"but also because this is an obvious, shameless PR stunt."
---
Your opinion again. You just won't learn, will you? Try by taking the tin fol hat off.
---
Im glad, not only does it give me some serious playtime with several Outer Worlds playthroughs, it means they should have the time to put into it to make it right and fix some of these other bugs that really suck.
---
That outfit the human is wearing tho
---
I need it. I don't care if I have to pickpocket it or if I have to kill her for it, I'm gettin it
---
Goldeneye and you got a deal.
---
No oddjob
---
Yea but plans change never say something is solid till it happens clearly. Besides if we get a thanks giving event and Christmas event that would be great
---
Why?  They make suppressors for just about every weapon in real life.
---
Wow, I had no idea. A) thank you, and B) how did you figure that out?
---
I give it til tomorrow afternoon.
---
 [https://imgur.com/GexPV64](https://imgur.com/GexPV64) , this is a detailed map of pump code spawn locations, most of the spawns seem to be clustered in seed bank management and greenhouse 5 and mostly two spawns in each pump room.
---
Yes, actually twice. One as gift for my girlfriend. So about 160 USD for this fucking, greedy, Horseshit.
---
I myself am glad that they admitted it isn't polished and needs more time. I will gladly take a delay for a good product rather a rushed, buggy mess.
---
Can they add something to do in this game tho?
---
Here's one way. Get addicted to 5 things. Find a Junkie's Heavy Weapon (e.g. minigun, 50 cal, lmg) throw on 9 points of Heavy Gunner and you will take out just about anything in a matter of seconds. Of course, read up on it first so you can make an informed decision.
---
I agree with the camp stuff and won't repeat what you've already said. But in addition I think permanent camps and workshops would be cool. More than one per person would be great too. And let us build at other people's camps. I'd love to have a fully-fledged "town" that my friends and I can return to as we please. 
---
And assuming that characters end up being server-locked (if this isn't the case when private servers drop, it will definitely be the case when mods come), then I'd want to see ways to skip some of the grind. Faster XP gain, more caps for vendors, etc. Also personally I'd love to see an option to turn off some of the survival elements. Hunger, thirst and repair are just tedious to me. All of this stuff exists for balancing purposes, but balance doesn't matter on a private server that's only open to a few friends.
---
Hahaha excellent
---
I’ll still play regardless I enjoy the game and Im just happy they are at least still working on it and that they didn’t abandon it long ago
---
The pipe weapons got good effects too gpt like two instigating explosive ones and a bloodied one
---
Whenever I think of a "smg" I always think of a suppressed mp5, and it's one of the only weapons to not have one in the game. It just seemed like a weird design choice, since even the combat shotgun has a suppressor.
---
Private servers WOOHOOOOOO!!!!
---
&gt;Our goal for players who purchase this service
---
wha...
---
&gt;...players who PURCHASE this service
---
b...but...
---
&gt;...PURCHASE this service
---
hnnnngggg
---
&gt;##**PURCHASE**
---
.....booooo....
---
True but would rather that be delayed the. Get a half assed dlc. They should add some kind of content though
---
3 thumbs up!
---
then it will go f2p to see how much they can milk to cow before the need to shoot it.
---
I think this new generation hanging on what these child youtubers think is really interesting to me. What do you think about the delay?
---
Repair kits are awesome, but since they drop from SQB you don't have to buy them I am sitting on about 150 of them.
---
But the Axe does have mods.  Its got an AP mod that adds spikey thingys to the blade.
---
4 thumbs up!
---
...or allow us to enter our own sound-bytes when you give back the ability to change pip-boy colors hint hint
---
Disregard, im thinking of the Fire axe ... too  many axes.
---
If you change a title screen and there’s no one left logging in, does it still make an abrupt and intrusively loud noise that’s 20db louder than the rest of the game?
---
I'm son I never knew, I went to go get milk when you were 5
---
This reminds me, I'll never understand why they paid for an awesome catalogue of real jazz songs, but they only play inside the vault... why not make an extra radio station out of those?
---
slappers only
---
That would not be all that surprising really and still not worth getting my testicles in a tangle over.
---
People are fucking stupid.
---
&gt;Our approach to these items at launch was to keep them purely cosmetic. But after looking at all the data, it became clear that to consistently deliver content that keeps Fallout 76 fresh and exciting for all, we needed to rethink our approach to the Atomic Shop.

You mean money?
---
Very casual players probably don't hit the SBQ often if at all. Which is why I said they are for very casual players. I don't buu repair kits either, but I habr used the improved repair kits from the SBQ. Times where I forgot to repair my weapon before doing the raid and it breaks during. Boom repair kit.
---
Are people just trying to find things to whine  about now? It’s a title screen. Jeez
---
Possible, I got them somehow without purchasing them. Unless they came in a bundle and I didn't notice.
---
Immediately after exiting the vault. Though if you want level 50 weapons you have to level that character up to 50.
---
you can't prove that I'm wrong just as much as I can't prove that I'm right and vice-versa. so if I'm a tinfoil then you're a gullible child. it's just name calling and means nothing.
---
at least I got history on my side. because Bethesda is such a trustworthy company, right? look at their track record. **spotless**.
---
Same i absolutely agree with everything you said
---
Thank you for making the decision to delay the release, it’s gotta be a hard decision to call, but building trust with the community is always the best move. Thanks!
---
It’s hit or miss lol, I’ve expressed this sentiment in a less inflammatory way and been spam downvoted lol, I think this announcement from Beth today combined with their horrible wording, gave me some leeway for an “I told you so.”
---
Lol that is funny thanks stuck at work needed a little chuckle....so funny and so right
---
I totally agree with wastelander84. Launch was atrocious. I'm actually surprised they said we're holding it. I would rather have an extra few minutes on planing instead of the launch all over again.
---
Jesus you complain a lot. Back in my day...
---
Why do you watch it if you obviously have a different opinion on it?
---
From a business standpoint, that really wouldn't make any sense. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is a major factor when dealing with stuff in the Atomic Shop. I'd reckon their sales would literally plummet if they *stopped* removing items.
---
They outta... It was always the most annoyingly loud weapon in Fallout 1 and 2 lol
---
The free ganes aren 60$
---
Personally i like bloodied stuff and having large carry weight and fighting melee. so i putt a lot of cards in to strength and got the radicool + stealth perks. But what also works very well is instigating stuff. Like strong single shot weapons, combined with the sneak perk. the instigating is times 2 and then theres another times 2 for the sneak attack. easy 500+ damage if you got a nice sniper or harpoon gun etc. and you get to keep your health. 
---
im in love with "the unstoppable monster" but i think that might be a legacy weapon now that survival mode is gone and you cant get a special weapon every week anymore.
---
You dont need it to play an earn rewards. Just the bonus rewards. I play every season and never buy
---
I own the collectron and can say that is 100% true! I got him just to have a cool funny robot in my CAMP. Most of the time I forget to even collect his junk. I'm actually thinking about unlocking it so other people  can collect if they want it
---
I was like you when i was like level 80. then i took a good look at my perks and arranged them again. it changed a lot. since i just collected random perks while leveling. i was able to turn off like half of them and exchange them for usefull perks to get higher damage.
---
I think we all know the answer to that, unfortunately.
---
"Private servers, sweet, time to reinstall FO76!"
---
"Purchase..."
---
"Sweet, room to install other games then."
---
That's exactly what the repair kits are.  It's not like it's hard to repair weapons, it's the frequency with which some weapons need to be repaired.  Some weapons are balanced like shit and when I use them I'm constantly thinking about the next time I'll need to repair them.  If it fucking breaks in the middle of a quest then I have to stop what I'm doing to hunt down a workbench and that shit is no fun.
---
I know this encounter well, and look forward to the excitment!  Just south is a cave with a level 91 glowing deathclaw, and just south of that a random spawn point that can generate a legendary Sheepsquatch.  Good times start at the pumpkin house!!
---
I got rid of mine because it was so effin annoying. Love the refrigerator tho
---
I love my bffr handmade and im a vanguard build. Thing just rips with vat crits.
---
They don't know either, so it's fine. Nobody knows wtf most of that information meant except Bethesda
---
At least they’re not embracing communism.
---
Omg...
---
I hate to say it, but I've reached the point of inventory frustration that I'm almost willing to pay for either a larger stash size or a shared stash box that I can use to transfer items to my other characters.  Most of my stash limit issues are trying to find ways to give cool stuff to my other characters without having to deal with another person to perform the transfer.
---
Original post was a mess 
---
Edit 2: I think if you’re ok with running lower health, bloodied would be a good choice  but you definitely have to move some perks around to combat some of those negatives, what does your armor set up look like? And do you have any mutations ie adrenal reaction/eagle eyes
---
Im thinking 10 just because its their own network, not us working as hosts.
---
Yup...will get crap stuff twice as fast now yay :)
---
There last comment on it was on Tuesday lol. I don’t think we need a thanksgiving event, seems a little weird in the wasteland. Maybe we sit down with mole miners, super mutants and scorched lol. Christmas event would be fun though.
---
Feeeling the exact same way!!!!
---
Just like how a weapon breaking in the middle of doing something is a huge inconvenience.  Some weapons have shit durability and aren't as balanced as they should be and having to hunt down a workbench or travel back to camp after every couple fights sucks major dong.  They knew there was a problem with weapon balance and durability so they added repair kits as a paid band aid.
---
u/Slayden10 u/BobaFett85
---
I'm glad you can realise that it is indeed naive.
---
Do people struggle with ammo that much that they would need a converter? I sell what I don't need and buy what I do need. I've always had enough ammo.
---
When it's something like .38 which no one buys and I have 5000 of, I bought a nice legendary pipe rifle and roll with that in the low level areas. Didn't realize pipe weapons are actually pretty good!
---
I hate it when they bring the stuff back. I want to be unique. Kinda given up on the store. Finally got the hunters long coat.
---
The community is happy your mad we'll be better off without you. Bye felicia!
---
EXACTLY!!!
---
That's great! Still doesn't change the fact it could change at last minute lol Wastelanders is a good example
---
Same, I dont get to play nearly as often as I'd like so I'm still perfectly content with legendary hunting... granted legendaries seem to be spawning much less now.
---
Okay for real though. I paid full price for the tricentennial edition, was on the BETA the first night, and have been backing 76 to real west virginian family while everybody talks sh!t. But Q1 2020 for this game to become a REAL fallout game. Wtf Bethesda? You gonna slide some atoms a real one's way or what? Y'all know people get got for bait and switches like this on the street!
---
Pretty certain this is misinformation. Bethesda mentioned you needed the plans to unlock legendary versions of the weapon. Also, I have 1 character with the plans. And I have had 3 fixer drops from the vendor on that character. spent a similar amount of scrip on my character without the plans and not 1 fixer.
---
They bring them back. Don’t fall for their tactics and fake scarcity.
---
Start at Wixon Homestead, then head to The Slocums Joe, Then go to Gauley Mine and go through it, then follow the tracks up to the Morgantown Train Yard area. After that go to the Morgantown Airport area, after that head for and do The Collision Course Event. If you still need to kill scorched at that point you can go inside the airport terminal itself, or head to Morgantown Highschool, great spot for plastic too. 
---
There's also Bolton Greens, AVR Medical Center and The Top of The World.
---
If you're higher level you can also hit The Glassed Cavern and kill the scorched in there as well as harvesting the Ultracite nodes, a few scorched will spawn and run towards your location every time you harvest an Ultracite node.
---
It will likely not even be atoms. More likely cash
---
This sounds like something a bethesda spy would ask, hey guys im just a regular player like u wanting to know how much bethesda should charge for something many other games dont charge for. 
---
Im thinking nothing since GTA is way more popular and doesnt charge anything.
---
Free private servers until wastelanders?
---
Of course the only pay to win items in the atom shop are the most popular.. What even?
---
Skipped to end to see a conclusion at that exact moment you got BE 50 cal... Mama Mmurgh loves you deeply.
---
Although true some people never play NW and would prefer an alternating title menu or the old version back
---
While I think having any option would be good, I personally think that the Private Servers will be exactly like regular ones, just without other people
---
Calm down champ. Its a discussion thread.
---
Shiiiiiiit
---
Just because you've never used a repair kit doesn't mean every weapon and playstyle is balanced to never need repair kits.  Some weapons break way too quickly and require repairs way too often.
---
not all of the community. and I never said I was going anywhere.
---
What? I can't hear you!
---
^(I'm deaf irl as well so)
---
I’m not disappointed. I’d rather not have a DLC that is a buggy mess or lacks content.
---
Hackers? PC?
---
When I read the notes and they mentioned the fridge and other items being the most popular I was like of course you idiots, you forced people to pay for functional buffs
---
I'm old enough to remember games having tons of hidden characters / levels / outfits.  That age is long gone.  Only indie games champion those features now.
---
I just don’t know why i didn’t get a single fixer or bear arm 🤔
---
Yeah, that's so weird to me.  Don't people want say, a bloodied, faster fire rate handmade rifle?  None of [these](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) third star ranged weapon effects mean anything compared to those first two, yet, it will cut your chances of getting one in half if you buy a bunch of 3 star instead of 2 star.
---
Also, I just don't find caps that useful after like level 50.  It's very difficult to buy a really good weapon with the amount you can hold on you anyway.  Anything good gets sold almost instantly or requires you to make a transaction that involved more than 30K caps which is a pain in the ass and introduces trust issues.
---
 The vast majority of games have title screens that never change. 
---
Just accept the fact that it will eventually change. If you feel the need to complain, focus on things about the game that actually effect said game's gameplay.
---
I like the nuclear winter title screen.
---
 LOL. Muties. Up on the cliff ... and there is a bunch below. Don PA and leap into the air, Jet Pack a bit and drop, crouched into the middle of the pack, all max level. Out with the Combat Knife and seconds later, with no expenditure at all, a pile of dead Muties. 
---
 I lose it sometimes. ;)
---
Well its definitely like renting a normal server online. Likely we will be using the same "server machine" as most other people, it will just be split and traffic will be low. These servers arent like renting a minecraft server or wow server for 1000s of players. They cant even exceed player threshold. The strain would be minimal keeping costs down.
---
What, like the rest of the game?
---
I hit a q/25/90 single action today! Takes a lifetime to reload but very satisfying. .50 indeed would be the absoult best.
---
Haven't had the chance to play it yet. I do remember the bad press, though. Speaking of bad press...
---
Like the title screen /s
---
I can't complain much other than the prices for the Atom Shop
---
A) You're welcome, and B) I can't claim credit for that, but there were some posts here from people that did the leg work. Search for 'how item respawns work' or similar. Disclaimer: world spawns and container contents are on separate respawn tracks; one of them has a 60 item queue while the other takes 160 pickups to respawn/refill the first. I always forget which is which, so it might actually be 160 items for world spawns, but to me it doesn't feel like so many. Source for my gut feeling: respawns within the Asylum.
---
TL;DR: Pick up more junk if you want to farm the same areas repeatedly for items.
---
&gt; I just want to play on my own
---
This, I stopped playing because of the weird level scaling when someone walks by basically...I just wanna play through the thing by myself, people say thats not fun, well...it is to me, not everyone games the same, I prefer Borderlands solo, beat them all solo, I'm more of a Unreal Tournament type guy when it comes to online.
---
They should really at least give some sort of offline mode or 4 player self host mode maybe...
---
Same got a bunch of garbage and two meh guns from my 900
---
I'm down. I've been mostly trying to complete atom things lately and getting more mods for my backpack. Add me!
---
My ign is KittyKabobs
---
I love how if you wanna play online with your friends in a private server, you have to pay with real cash. Imagine if every game did this..
---
I know there had been interest in the radium due to Wastelanders--- still sought after or do people want gamma?
---
Q/E Single Action is one of my dream guns. Simply for the stupid-fun.
---
At this point it'll be surprised if any quality of life/convenience item isn't thrown into the atomic cash shop.
---
Like what bethesda game ever?
---
Awesome! I forgot to post my ign on there. Mine should be SirAdray.
---
No shit they sold well.  No player wants to be left out.
---
Well that sucks, waited almost a year for something that the community has wanted and we have to pay for it. Great marketing to keep your game alive, Bethesda. 👍
---
Might as well sell us loadouts too.
---
I'm more worried about losing high level players. It's already hard to find enough people to do Arktos Pharma or Encryptid if you don't play in a group. But the power players are going to be the ones getting private servers. You'll probably still see people popping on for the vendors to sell their wares, but fracturing the playerbase at this point just doesn't seem like a good idea.
---
Haha caught me
---
Welp, I'm fucking disgusted.
---
Take a look at the collectron. Everyone was / is whining about how it is P2W, and that they refuse to get one.
---
Either noone on this reddit actually plays the game, or the whiners are a very small but very loud minority.
---
Like, literally everyone ingame has a fucking collectron.
---
Yeah, at least the company is being honest and trying to build some trust with us though
---
tbh it means, "Eh"
---
Iiiiiiiit's Grafton's Major! But you know that!
---
Not that bad, not that bad. I haven't used all my script yet, I didn't want to use it all in one go, yet. My alt I mainly only did armor on, and I got some shit armor.. I did 2 star and 3 star on armor, and yes.. I got some unyeilding pieces with AP refresh, but they were all leather with about 20 DR on them which, yes it has ap refresh, but that's about it. On my main I got a bloodied fixer with faster fire rate. Good, but still want less AP. And a couple of decent ish weapons. Nothing too good yet. I'm thinking my alt might not be able to get good armor because he doesn't know heavy combat armor plans and what not? Idk. I know the system for the new weapons works on plans, but idk about armor and stuff.
---
My issue is that they can change how useful these utility items are.
---
"Patch 200: Increased food spoilage, decreased food availability, water now spoils, refrigerated food satisfies 200% extra hunger, etc."
---
Sounds fun to me. At least we won't have to lure it to the ground outside a nuke zone to fight like the queen
---
The only positive I see is more public events so that you can get one every 15 mins. Since the public event system went to shit, my level up is about once a day, maybe a level and a half. From the 3 I was getting before. Like, for delaying EVERYTHING until next year, they should give us more.
---
Remember patch 11 that deleted entire inventories, characters and powerarmors
---
When did Blennerhassett island teleport out of the Ohio into the Kanawha?
---
Lol just messing. I wont be playing private servers even if they were free like meeting new people and it is crazy the diversity of players. But really dont care what they charge, maybe it will be 7.99 like most subscriptions start at lol
---
I’m in the same boat as you, ign is Ghostpirates if you play in the evening/night.
---
Phew! I thought everyone but me was getting fixers and bloodied handmades. Thanks for not making me feel so bad!
---
I love that idea
---
Yeahp.
---
Don't worry. Bethesda have heard you. Simply buy the Legendary Seeker Helmet for only 2000 atoms. While wearing the LSH, you'll be able to increase the odds of whatever legendary effect you're looking for.
---
I'm curious if you're a high level and have collected a lot of things.
---
Ah okay thanks !!
---
Like a Hong Kong protester in China.
---
I actually kind of like it, I wait so I can snatch up stuff at a discount.
---
I do tend to play in the evening and nights. I'll give you an add. I'm on the east coast. My ign is SirAdray
---
That TSFFR combat rifle is looking 👌🏼
---
Really? My explosions all do around 30- 40 damage each, wiuthout the perk it’s like 7 or 8 damage for the “explosions”
---
I never seem to have more than 20 on me.  I use them instead of workbench repairs, becuase when your shit breaks its usually in the middle of a farm (it always happens to me in westtek)
---
A few queen runs and you are set for a few days though.
---
I mean, a refrigerator to stop/slow food from spoiling is pretty nice
---
I’m always happy to help 😅 but honestly i was hoping for at least one bear arm out of my 80 melee rolls 😔
---
Waste your money buying the plans if you want. I'm telling you I got one today without knowing  the plans.
---
There are 2 floors that haven't come back.
---
It makes no sense why there is no silencer . I feel your pain man. The single action revolver is my fav weapon and it doesn't have shit for mods either. With the delay of wastlanders I really hope they come up with a weapon buff and balancing patch soon. Game needs a change up. Seeing everyone run around with sneaky rilfes and meat hooks gets old
---
My two tone door hasn't been brought back. Some stuff won't likely come back simply cause it didn't sell well. You can tell what does and doesn't sell well by looking at things in player camps. A lot of clothing like the monocle just isn't worth the atoms so they take it out and put new items in.
---
Haven’t been home yet, looking forward to crap.
---
I'll say it again. I want my Sleepytime
---
Your right there may actually be more, the weird free items like the shag carpet
---
Same with the music played on the strip in new Vegas.
---
I am 100% out once wastelanders hits.  It's going to be a waste of time and for sure going to make the game implode. I am far more terrified than excited for wastelanders
---
More like B00t\_Smoocher
---
Well I wish you the best of luck
---
I'm sitting on 2800 but I'm also not earning much more cause some of the atom challenges are broken for me. Like the game one, the events one.  Magazines seems to be alittle broken, as I haven't gotten even the achievement for reading 20 magazines. They said they are working on atom challenges for the next year so hopefully maybe each character can have their own challenges to earn atoms? Idk, I'm saving my atoms for something that really catches my eyes. Mainly if they ever released a outcast pack. Or something that's really cool and not basic.
---
I just did Camden park once a day till I was done.
---
Actually if you are on PC I can sell it tomorrow (because now I’m going to watch some Star Trek second generation and then hit the bed) 😅
---
to me though they actually got this one right - there is a better, free variant you earn in game.  I'll never buy a repair kit or use crafting benches to repair anything ever again as I just run SBQ and the vault missions to get improved repair kits.
---
Flash forward and every other "utility" item departed from this formula.  There's no way to earn scrap kits, or a refrigerator, or the scrap bot other than the atom store.
---
Seems like a cynical direction to take these items.  Why not stick to the free option earnable in game plus a paid variant?  This would have been received with much less push back.
---
Too sensible, you're fired!
---
“Thanks we will continue not logging in”. -player base.  I wish they would just devote these resources to FO5 so that the single player experience (assuming that exists) doesn’t suffer. FO4 is extremely fun and I hope that FO5 is similar.
---
I mean, I'd love to second that motion but without text chat I really don't know how cool anyone is in-game.... xD  
---
I personally don't want private servers to escape the community though. I want them to mod the game into better shape, and to reduce the hellish lag I get when I'm on a populated server (especially one with high level people who own tons of shit and drop nukes to farm huge packs of mobs...)
---
I don’t have an issue with them making money. I hope they make millions and millions of dollars selling cosmetics and novelty items in the shop. I don’t have an issue with rebalancing how many free Atoms there are, quite honestly, I don’t care if there are none. I just don’t want to see a situation where they’re shoving inconvenient mechanics and timers into the game that I need to buy “Utility” items to avoid.
---
I assume you have those 2 plans learned correct?
---
Congrats!
---
Would your wife (or you, for that matter) be willing to name the child "Dogmeat"?  So many fun stories/times to share as they grow up.  :)
---
Yes fixer on all characters and bear arm on two that i used to buy 2 star melee
---
Every new camp decor suggestion comes with a side of disappointment when you realize it's more likely to be added to the Atom Shop than anything else. xD
---
That is really disappointing. I was hoping they would go the route of Destiny 2 and let you go through a process to link your copy of the game to your steam account. I guess Destiny 2 is fairly different though since they went F2P with their steam launch.
---
Honestly, I think private servers might boost cheating alittle. Since someone could pay, dupe their hearts out or have hacks, and just level up from there without even messing with public servers. Which is a plus, and it also isn't a plus. Also, I'm wondering how vendors will work since the vendors junk they sell is based on the players in the world, or how many there are, or something along those lines
---
Picked up a quad, +33% V.A.T.S hit chance, 25% less ap cost Radium rifle that's pretty neat, other than that, 950 scrip worth of crap
---
Now to figure out what to do with all that weight!
---
With crisp crap..as  always
---
Worth to mention as well that on my previous video with 4k scrip on 25% sale i got couple fixers
---
Ha! Thank! That would be something. It's a little girl, before we knew the sex I was being a butt and throw names out like what about Arthur Morgan ?! She didn't like Boone either unfortunately.
---
I didn't think of the free one, it was nasty tho 😅 The 2 I get asked about, are the tile mosaic, and the whitespings one. They haven't come back.
---
I will play on my main only until all this stuff will get exchanged 😉
---
She's still mean. On my alt I went through almost all my script on armor trying to get AP refresh unyeilding, and I get leather pieces with it.. I mean, it's decent, but she needs to stop giving me all these god damn nocturnal armor!
---
But she's also still a nice lady, I got a bloodied ffr earlier. I feel like they might have buffed the chances for those weapons since they were delaying wastelanders.
---
coming to atom store q4 /s
---
3k worth of junk with like 5 pieces of armor that is worth a second look. Not a single Fixer or Handmade in the bunch.
---
I server hopped every 200 scrip spent, Didn't help.
---
I got alot of wood armor, troubleshooters and God damn nocturnal
---
I'd say from my travels the most popular categories are plushies by far. Hard to find a camp without them. Those and the Mr Fuzzy ride. The collectron is popular as well, but I can probably count the number of times I've seen fridges. And who the heck buys scrap and repair kits?
---
Just wait until the new public event system comes out, I bet not many will get it since it'll be based on participation somehow next year
---
I agree. Which is why the statement concerns me in the first place. If it’s just going to be more things like that, why not just say so? Why not just give a few examples of what’s coming?
---
Unlikely, most people that lock up their bases don't realize how easy it is to just glitch in anyway.  Thanks Behtesda.
---
"What, you're not ok with legendary loot crates in the atom shop?  Well, see ya, buddy!  More for me!"
---
solid troll.. buttons well pressed.. wood downvote again
---
I'm disappointed it's delayed but it will be worth it when it comes out
---
I just want the yellow hooded robe to go over my armor like every single other outfit instead of behaving like the hazmat suit.
---
Im a sucker for buying shit for my CAMP from the atom shop so ill undoubtedly get this for my camp, will of course be available to use by any passer by
---
I wonder, will be able to permantly claim workshops?
---
That would be really cool.
---
So just to remind people u actually used to pay to have ur own world it was single player and u paid for the title, even with call of duty u could play up to 4 players. Now these companies are going in a direction that i believe will end up costing more than u think. If it was set up that i could buy a private server and the game was included that would make more sense but for some it is pay 60.00 for the title and then a monthly service plan just to be able to play. GTA is set up with private servers that allow walk in as long as they follow the rules and guess what they are free? This game has become highly monetized and it is kinda getting out of hand, im amazed more players dont have an issue with this. Me i will stick to public servers and since i only paid 15.00 for the title am not out very much if i end up not enjoying it down the road.
---
I think the fridge is useless and I brought it.... because I wanted a fridge, I dont put stuff into it, I just want a fridge in my house

And the biggest child award goes to: OP
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
\*insert heavy eyeroll here\*  
---
You could have used any of the other threads, but no...
---
Heck yeah!!! $80 bucks to win the game 💰💰💰💰💰💰🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼.  SOLD
---
Right?! I really didn’t want any of you in my game either but there you were. And it wasn’t that bad. You guys are actually kind of fun and I even use a mic to talk to a few of you. It would be weird and lonely to be the only real person in the world.
---
"It's totally cosmetic"
---
I've got 20% weapon weight reduction on everything right now, but I'm looking to try and find some pieces of Unyielding + WWR on some stuff now (already have 1 piece) if I decide to go through with the BE LMG.
---
Tested some perks &amp; looked at the damage of the BE LMG compared to the JE, and the BE was *so* much higher, even w/o max Demo Expert.
---
As for mutations, I don't have Adrenal Reaction nor Eagle Eyes, but I'm server-hopping around hoping to find a player vendor with some serums.
---
Thats exactly what I did, I dont even put stuff in my fridge and I rarely collect the stuff my robot gets me
---
I've been out of town for a week. I just logged on but only had enough scrip for one. It was a 3-star Junkie's Lever Action (faster reload and explosive). Not bad!
---
I like my monocle... had it since last December lol
---
Which system are you on?
---
PC
---
That should be enough to keep me occupied until "Q1" or whatever.
---
Honestly they should of just called it the Chinese salut. China were never the real bad guys in this series. The U.S. government has always been pre-war and post-war in the form of the fascist Enclave.
---
If on PC you can edit your pref. file and have it remove the music, and some of the startup logo.
---
I had to do it for the same reason. NW is bad enough as it is sometimes (see: cheaters).
---
&gt; There's nothing wrong with having utility items in the store.
---
"We know this game mechanic is shitty and not fun but that's why we added this new atom shop item for only 100 atoms."
---
Eso only does the latest dlc installed as its main menu!
---
Some guys figured out a cool little trick not too long back that works with all builds...If you right-click on fallout 76 and click uninstall and delete, you can free up some unused space on your system.
---
Please do this. I started playing in July and saw a video of the original intro. The old one was far and away better!
---
Got it, barely use it. Too budget heavy :P
---
&gt;If on PC you can edit your pref. file and have it remove the music, and some of the startup logo.
---
&gt;We hope you’re as excited as we are for everything coming. We’re doing it all to ensure Fallout 76 remains vibrant and growing for years to come.
---
I hope this doesn't mean waiting 20 years for the next fallout game.
---
How good are your multiple computers you have in your house, we ran a free minecraft server years ao and it was awful coming from my brothers PC (which was the best in the house)  
---
I currently am renting a minecraft server for just under £10 and Its really good, definately getting my moneys worth with it
---
If its the music that's bugging you, and you're on PC you can remove it.
---
I don't know if I'll be much help, being only level 32, but it might be nice to have some friends.  
---
My IGN is NeverTrevor
---
When can I acquire this cap printer???? I will buy two.
---
You understand that your isp and besthesda are different companies right
---
First of all, thank you for your reply. I much prefer to engage with people over differing opinions than just downvote things I don't agree with, which isn't even really what downvoting is for. Unfortunately, sincere engagement is a rarity on the internet.  
---
To your point, though, I've seen that sentiment quite a bit, but what I don't understand is the idea of "sticking around" as a positive or negative. Its not like there's a subscription fee or anything, so just put the game away, play it if you feel like it, or don't. I wouldn't blame anyone for stopping playing until Wastelanders comes out. Obviously, Bethesda doesn't want to see massive player count decrease. But if they do, perhaps that will motivate them to put out some good small content in the interim, something that will entice fallen-off players to jump back in, even if just for a few days.  
---
People say, speak with your wallet, but since we've already bought the game... Speak with your time. If less people are playing, it will get Bethesda's attention. If you decide not to play, I really hope that you come back for Wastelanders and I hope you enjoy it.
---
Well, just to be a doomsaying cynic. I read that entire part of the update as "well, we could up the Atom rewards for difficult challenges, but that potentially gives us less money. So instead we are going to give you stimpacks, maybe even a few repair kits, and aid/junk items, and call it a favor or 'rewarding other playstyles', so you are more likely to buy that extra few hundred Atoms next time you like something in our store."
---
This game should just have paid expansions or a subscription fee
---
He said "I only bought it for X feature which won't be avaialble for months"
---
I replied with "IF that's true you're an idiot."
---
Seriously, why the fuck would someone spend full price on a game that doesn't have the feature they want when they could have waited until said feature was released and buy the game at a discount?
---
You should be ashamed of yourself for completely failing reading comprehension, you asshole dick sucker.
---
94s lag is just general script lag, in particular lag from the anti cheat scripts they have firing off in there. The instancing itself isn't the culprit.
---
Now to be fair, I mainly brought atoms because the things they were selling were "limited time" so I got atoms.... only to see these limited time items now return to the shop which would have given me ample time to save atoms up and get for free (red rocket sign, power armour rider skins)
---
I too get at least one of these blue screens per session on the PS4
---
Mama is telling me I need to do drugs....got a junkies fixer +33 vats 15 reload and a junkies explosive assault rifle.... a few pieces of armor that may work but mostly I’m just over encumbered now :-)
---
Quad 33% hit chance 25% less ap cost Radium rifle was the only good thing I got out of 1150 scrip
---
Either way, with Wastelanders being delayed for another 3+ months, I'm thinking they won't be as desired for the time being.
---
I will give you an add. I'm cool running and doing quests and leveling up. My IGN is SirAdray
---
“Don’t have time to play and get the atoms” yeah that’s kind of the point and what’s slowly ruining this game
---
I got it right before it “retired “. I had NO IDEA how obnoxious and annoying it would be. It is sooooooo loud! The perk of it is that has a handy “proximity alarm”.
---
As smeone who doesnt really like PvP or not really that into the battle royal mode, yeah Im taking a bit of a break from it, the last updates that interested me were back in spring, and now the next update to interest me is next year, not that im really complaining about the delay, would rather a good launch of wastelanders later than a shitty launch now.  
---
Just gives me more time to play other things while I wait
---
Scrap kits are completely useless for those of us with full stashes lol.
---
I just hope we see a few humans before wastelanders, as a tease that more are coming.
---
And i agree wholeheartedly.
---
I think it’s a Fallout joke, like crappy shack door.
---
Stop defending Bethesda's nickle and diming. Seriously we have all paid enough for this game already!
---
Ah, does it? I must've misread.
---
Of course they were going to use the sales of the scraper bots and fridges to justify adding more and more qol items to the store. That's what everyone has been calling out each time this stuff is released. Yet people justify it every time by saying "but it's not pay to win" and mocking people for being entitled. 
---
Ammo scrapper is definitely the big one for me. I'll be super disappointed (but not entirely surprised) if these are atom shop only. Especially given that I'm constantly dumping ammo because I cant sell it to vendors or anything useful.
---
Maybe so they can be dedicated servers so your friends can still play on your server when your not online?
---
They already do, you can use any sort of cosmetic mod you want without any trouble caused
---
It’s nice if you actually would store food in a stash. Seems like a waste of space to me. And who wants to go back to their camp every time they want to eat?
---
Killing Floor, 7 Days To Die
---
It's almost impressive how you managed to miss the context and point of my post in one sentence.
---
I can’t wait for this... five months from now
---
fantastic.. the less people who play the better the servers run..
---
thanks for helping!
---
Personally I think it's good Bethesda delayed wastelanders. I rather have it polished than something buggy and have the possibility of losing progress like people were having with the vault 94 raids.
---
Was the tourist quest always in game?
---
Wait what am I missing? I haven't been able to play today.
---
Kind of hard to avoid his videos in my feed when they're recommended to me on youtube
---
Wastelanders was never the summer expansion... that was always nuclear winter...
---
And scorchbeasts still drop PA mod plans...
---
My Doctor-themed character loves this.
---
I did have it finally work, you have to buy them, put them in your stash, and log out and back in with that character.
---
Pretty mediocre, how she treat you?
---
Great idea, yet not feasible.
---
Since the clock and all other items are server-sided, what timezone should be used? The servers don't adhere to any zone.
---
Exactly! There are a lot of ways this could be exploited depending on how they're going to function
---
By that logic people who are OK with this have no idea about free private servers on other games.
---
I guess, it’s just the normal servers are so tame I don’t see a point in avoiding other players like I would actively do in other games like GTA. Unless these private servers bring some persistence to the world I just don’t see why being able to play on them is any more significant, since our camps and everything follow us from server to server.
---
Well 76 was launched wayyyy too early, so I'm happy for them to take the time they need with wastelanders.
---
As for paid servers and more non cosmetics in the shop... go fuck yourselves.
---
Welcome to RNG
---
God damn it, I’m so fucking tired of this shit. First Doom and now this, what else are you gonna do Bethesda? I really hope you guys don’t fuck this up more than you already did with the new Wolfenstein and Doom Eternal’s multiplayer.
---
Also, I can’t stand being part and watching as a 60 fucking dollar game finds more ways to shoehorn none cosmetic items that affect gameplay into the atomic shop, I really can’t stand it.
---
They wouldn’t know how to get it right. The damn pipboy date is the same everyday. The time might be right but they don’t care. They rationalize this by throwing more over priced atomic shit at us until we drown in raider and free states junk
---
One of the Tadpole badges. You have to start the Tadpole quest first, then one of the challenges is a swimming test down at Spruce Knob. Have you started tadpole yet?
---
Maybe with free private servers they could get more people playing and paying big $$$ for atom shop items?
---
I have decided to give up on the game until Wastelanders arrives. And if by then the game is pay2win, then I would like everyone to know that it has been a great experience to be a part of this community. It was so good while it lasted.
---
Reading some posts on Reddit, you would think everything Bethedsa ever does is wrong.
---
 The reality is though,Reddit is only a small minority of Fallout 76 player Base.
---
The ATOM Shop has been a huge [success.](https://success.You)One only need to visit players camps to confirm this.
---
players have asked  for paid private servers.
---
No one is forcing players to buy ATOMS,or pay for any private servers.
---
Supply and demand.
---
The younger generation gamers love all this cosmetic stuff.
---
There is big money to be made in it.
---
They already fucked up the events so badly, and that’ll just make it worse. With everyone one shotting things these days, it’s basically pure luck with the spawning who gets the kills, so I can just see myself getting screwed bc the speed demon/melee spammer is getting all the kills and the game will say I didn’t contribute lol
---
It is not unplayable lol. Anyone who is saying that either a) has not played the game or b) is a massive troll. I am 550+ hours in. Worth more than $20. Big update coming in q1 next year.
---
There's a magazine that reduces enemy player VATS accuracy by 50%, use that if it really bothers you.
---
It just stays stored. And then the NEXT time you join a server your camp will be deployed. Dont worry, as long as you dont place a new camp, your old camp is fine
---
Google junkie vs bloodied and there's an AMAZING write up here on Reddit. I refer to that post whenever I change up my addictions. I went from junkie unarmed/heavy, to junkie sneak vats crit rifles. it's my total jam. right now I'm running 1 strength and keeping my luck and agility untouched. it's all in what you want your build to lean towards.
---
That’s what I was hoping for! Thx!
---
If you live near harpers ferry you must buy now
---
Dang! Well don’t pay more then 500 caps if you do find any, between 300-500 is the range
---
If you're sick of people complaining about bugs with a $60 game, just wait til we get bugs on a $60 game with $10/month subscription fees.
---
Bloodied unarmed melee builds are the strongest build in the game. That's what I run and my damage numbers in my gauntlet are always above 2000 and I can one shot everything in the game besides scorch queen and imposter sheepsquatch
---
Basically paid servers would be for the folks who plan to have big(ish) group servers I guess.  Though at most you can only have 24 people or whatever on a map? So unless they change that, larger communities won't even be able to do much.
---
Minecraft is the perfect example of why not both. They have Realms for the paid server and you can take the game and put a server anywhere you want and mod it however you want. The problem most likely has to do with the Atom shop. They don't want people finding workaround to get all the stuff free. Minecraft only has microtransactions on consoles or pocket edition which are all locked and can't just be installed anywhere.
---
Your good to do it
---
Sameeeee
---
"share why we're so optimistic" 
---
*Doubt intensifies*
---
Dude I sorry you have bad luck but I am happy with my junkies explosive combat rifle and executioners explosive handmade I got today
---
They've not stated they're taking away challenges. It's a speculative response from the community.
---
BETHESDA: “You can have a thumbs up emote and the panic emote with a pumpkin picture over your head.”
---
And staying in a server that cant place your camp gives you a free new camp placement to make up for it
---
550 scrip of utter shite. I don't know why it was so very bad. I had some good drops last week.
---
Feel free to judge the scumbag who took your spot with a wooden cube!
---
Idk why there isn’t an account-wide inventory, it makes no sense.
---
This is my main concern. It seems tempting to always have a vast amount of resources at my finger tips but I see a lot of ways for exploits here
---
Hah!
---
Of July.  2021.
---
No thanks. I got some god rolls with current system lol
---
Crossplay would be nice, though it will drastically change the trading market, at least on PC.
---
I agree. 
---
With paid expansions or subscription fee we will get better product.
---
Ah okay, thanks! I got worried for a second there.
---
I have alot of fallout friends and some people do have your luck haha, even with the new highly sought after fixer... But I have never gotten a useful gun... Maybe my mutants ultracite gatling .... Not the best tho but can't complain about that.... You should see the screenshots of the 20 weapons I got today 😅 id rather use non legendary weapons ^ good thing that murgmurghgh is good to you tho. I want people to like the game ! I love fallout76 but occasionally things like this bring an unbearable amount of stress
---
Mama knows best ;)
---
what console or pc
---
From the patch 13 notes:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d28asr/fallout_76_patch_13_notes_september_10_2019/
---
&gt;The Purveyor: When purchasing weapons from the Purveyor, players now have a chance to receive legendary versions of the following weapons (as long the player has already learned the recipes for the base weapon):
---
Sheepsquatch Club
---
Sheepsquatch Staff
---
Shepherds Crook
---
The Fixer
---
Bear Arm
---
I'd bet money you got the plans a while ago and learned them already. Go into a weapon bench and see if you can craft one.
---
oof, shoulda made that clear. I play on Xbox One, gamertag is Davey OwO
---
Oh wow thank you much!
---
\+1
---
Haven’t had a chance to meet with her yet but hopefully she treats me well.
---
People are talking about [this](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more) nore specifically the aton store changes. Though seem to forget
---
&gt;Our main objective is to avoid a situation where players can spend money to gain a competitive advantage or make the game worse for other players 
---
Being in the same article theyre complaing about.
---
I’ve barely started it
---
Almost certainly and they wouldn’t be taking all the cool shit and telling you take out your wallet. We also wouldn’t have controversies over shit like fridges every couple months 🙄
---
Well I wish you better luck in the future
---
I suppose that’s  something I hadn’t considered
---
Fingers crossed, stranger!
---
Good for you ^ I want that to be the occasion but in desperate times I would pay a high scrip. I farm scrips but can only get desired weapons through Reddit trading .... And that does give the best possible weapons ...
---
My thoughts too
---
Yeah..over 1300 hours in game for me. Now All I see are people hanging around camps trying to sell stuff. Nobody’s does events (when they finally show up). 
---
I’m done.  Removed the game.  I still have FO4 though...maybe I’ll do something there.
---
I’d vote Junkies. Bloodied is too fragile in my opinion... and it’s way too popular. Here’s my heavy Junkies build
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f323fa8&amp;d=au1a04ib4ic4s12ip1ep0ew0sw2s22pq1pj0ls2sq2s32sr2lt2l71c71a72&amp;w=s72sb2s92cu2p90pa0a42s50si0se2sj0at1ag2ij2if2iq2i71c31c51cr0p80lm2&amp;n=&amp;m=&amp;nw=
---
Bonus points if the circle is in the middle of that funny glowing green ravine down at the bottom of the map.
---
I think OP is referring to a bug that happened with the mystery pick where it was giving out limb damage on everything.
---
I know for my two characters the results were random
---
Indeed!
---
Hopefully they'll let us do this in the future, especially when official mod support drops.
---
The Q FFR Tesla is pretty good, even being a 2 star. What are you looking for in trade? If you’ll take caps, let me know what you’re thinking.
---
Congrats! You are going to have a blast at West Tek! Better start farming springs, adhesive, lead, acid, steel.  Them TSEs are buzzsaws, but break FAST.  Retired my TSE handmade simply for cost of repairs.
---
Really?
---
I swear to god the damaged cars hunt me. I distinctly remember dying by jumping onto a car in FO4.
---
This is why I strongly suspect we won't be able to move characters between Adventure mode and Private Servers.
---
So I can build a temporary camp in that server and next time I log in on an open one, my camp goes back to normal?!! How did I not know this after a year....
---
Big Bend Tunnel, Lewisburg, Riverside Manor, Summersville Dam, Summersville Docks, New Gad, Sutton, Helvetia, Greg's Mine Supply, Bolton Greens, Morgantown High School, Morgantown Airport.
---
Nice route if you've got the time (or the caps) to travel it all.
---
Had a quick glance through, the thing that stands out is the quad ffr tesla, that’s sought after. 
---
Generally bloodied melee with swing speed are always desirable, bloodied ffr and explosive weapons (especially handmades, fixers, 50 cals) certain main effects like anti armor, executioner’s, furious, instigating, junkie’s, quad, vampire, with ffr and explosive and good double vats effects...
---
As for armor, assassin’s, bolstering, chameleon, unyielding, vanguard’s, with AP refresh the most desirable 2nd effect, sentinel, cavalier, sneak the most sought after 3rd effect...
---
I’m generalising and missed out loads of info.. but is basic start 😂
---
NO, it will replace your original camp but if you want to move camps. Server hop until your camp cant be placed and then you can move for free because your camp was taken
---
Hello. No mule and near max caps with lots of stuff to sell? Thats where your alt caps come in. Im talking about selling stuff / services for 5.56 ammo. Thats the alt currency being used.  Thats what im doing. Hopefully that helps. 
---
Alternatively, u can buy 5.56 ammo and stock up while selling stuff for caps as long as u have cap space.
---
Hopefully they'll let us host with our hardware when official mod support drops.
---
The explanation I’ve seen is that you have to look 180 world containers to reset those. I have two mules that just camp at train stations. No containers have contents for them, but they only walk to the train station, sell my serums, and log out once a day.
---
That was for the mystery pick like 2 weeks ago. Then they changed it to a sale
---
Yes, yes I do have a problem
---
Hence why **my** fiancé also has a mule sitting over there on her xbox and account 🤣
---
I'm having the same issue, and I know it's not respawning cause what's the odds someone else vaporized a ghoul in the same exact spot as I did.some Items do respawn, but for the most part the area looks the same,im on xbox
---
I'm wondering if they'll do a scaling price based on how many players the server will support. Maybe $9.99 / month for a full 24, $4.99 for 10, $1.99 for 4... something like that.
---
Good. The community doesnt need your friend, dont need you either. Go play other games. Servers run better the less people there are. STAY AWAY!!!!
---
It's pretty easy yo, when you die you drop a bag with your junk in it. If you can't go back in to get your bag back you lose it.
---
I bought a 2nd PC copy for a mule and to log in and sit at my camp for the perk boost. Go my main to 120 and got bored.
---
Now my main sits at camp and I am leveling my mule...
---
It's OK. As long as you started it. Are you on Xbox?
---
As for mules or alt characters, I pretty much just use them to hold caps, takes a few minutes to get a new character out of the vault. 
---
If my main is full then I get the buyer to meet me on my alt first, take the caps then leave world and rejoin on my main who is carrying the weapon or armor, need a decent trading karma level first though for people to trust that you won’t just disappear with their caps.
---
Fuck that noise, just use the system that's already in the game for the Mistress of Mystery gear. Base weapon + X amount of junk = same weapon at a higher level.
---
Yea. It's a business.
---
If they didn't want to find themselves in that sticky situation, *they shouldn't have stated verbatim that "all ATOM shop items will be consmetic"*
---
I'm also on xb1
---
xD I can understand.
---
My main is about 228
---
The point is they are not useless, and they are changing the way we play the game. If they were useless we wouldn't even use them at all, even if we were just handed them everywhere.
---
&gt; The only person who pays for the service is the host, not the guests. This is how it works with other games. 
---
Fallout 76 isn't "Other games"
---
Todd and his many alt accounts
---
? What part, I can correct it
---
What ever happens i have had my money worth out of this game.
---
I paid £15.00 for it brand new.And have had 700 hours out of it so far.
---
I am still enjoying it.
---
Sure I would love more content.
---
I enjoyed Fallout 4 so much i redid it like  3 times.The last time i played it, Father snuffed it,me and the Institute took over.I Felt awful killing everyone in the Railway,Father was very proud of me though,i was a Chip of the old Block.
---
"Again. It's hard to get similar items greenlit..... By your superiors.... If they're not actually selling well."
---
Which is precisely why padding the metrics by selling them in bundles of other things we actually want works to show them that the things we do not want are selling well. 
---
Does that make sense?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f395d65&amp;d=s42sm2se2sn2p52er1ed3ei1eu0c80cu2i12i44s11ir2a72a02l71lt2ss2&amp;w=&amp;m=c2f8h3d&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
I bought Bl3 last month and was just starting to get a bit bored after leveling and farming all the characters.  I was pretty pumped about wastelanders filling the void for awhile. If Wastelanders is great I don't mind the delay, but they better get it right or people that have been loyal will likely bail.
---
The items that arnt respawning are like the physical ones in the world not just the ones in containers etc
---
THANK YOU!!!!! Be nice if they had a marker show you where to go. I just spent hours trying to find this. Every damn YouTube video and guide is outdated. I watched one uploaded recently just to find out that the video had to have been made before patch 12. It drives me up a wall that they would male the one mission that the community hates with a passion worse!. Well not if you know where to go. Still, would it have killed Bethesda to have a guide marker? Again thank you all for telling me where to go.
---
It's going to bring some people into the game alright. I've already got folks on a Discord server who said they'll pick up the game to play on a private server if I set it up. I don't know if they'll stick with it, but it'll certainly bring folks.
---
Does anyone know now much private worlds will be or any idea
---
Bethesda doing something for the purposes of good will over $$$?
---
Tell em they're dreamin.
---
Theme it around the different areas. Change it every time someone logs in. Maybe show your character hanging out around the last place they were at or something.
---
It must just be a bug then! I've just not been able to find anyone with the issue until now.
---
Dunno, I just do the run in lucky hole
---
The prison is where I go, usually a ton and a bench to scrap it.
---
I play with a faction on xb1- are you 18+ (we are adult only) we run multiple queens everyday.
---
We communicate mostly by discord
---
Check bags and suitcases at train stations. People drop them all the time.
---
This would eliminate my want for having a server. My main thing is being able to do things with a large group of friends. Right now for group stuff half the people are in the queue so being able to load in 20+ would be awesome. But if stuff earned on there won’t cross over, not much point.
---
Not to mention, there should be special flux fish you can only catch in nuke zones.
---
Because I kind of love the idea of dropping a nuclear warhead and then waltzing into the fallout just to fish in peace while the hard radiation slowly chips away at your health.
---
I thought this was just me.  Unless I mash the volume to near zero (from normal tv watching level) when that comes on it scares the hell out of my wife and son wherever they are in the house.
---
I’ll give you the best advice of your lead searching life. Head down in lucky hole mine in some excavator. You’ll need acid but you’ll walk out with 1200 lead
---
Sneak Peak Q2 2020: A double xp weekend and rereleasing the flatwoods map in NW
---
Ohhhhh I got ya, lol thanks! That would’ve sucked! I’m not one to move around, I’ve had my camp on the pond at Marigold Pavilion since day 1....
---
&gt;I literally do not have time to switch weapons cause of it stalking me.
---
You can move while using the quick wheel...
---
&gt;All game content has been free for a full year
---
You paid $60 to enjoy the game. YOU PAID for that content. I get the game needs to make money, there are better ways to do it than to LIE to all of us about the nature of the Atomic Shop to sell the product and get people suckered in before monitizing this like a Free to play game on top of charging full price.  
---
Make no mistake about it, you already paid, and with the mentality that you didn't you will keep on paying.
---
1k scrip and all I got was a Quad tesla and a whole bunch of trash. You have done rather well!
---
If Todd Howard asked me for another 60 bucks to unlock offline mode I would thank him for the opportunity at this point.
---
My level 45 3 star bloodied lever action does, I kid you not 666 damage,lol.
---
I don’t *always* have time, I’m sorry it sounds a tad different for me
---
Maybe, but if allowing better (more complex/creative) mods makes more people pay to rent the private servers then they might look at that as an equally viable way to make money.
---
That won't happen. It'll be exactly the same as the standard map with the exception of you controlling who gets onto your server.
---
Yeah, unfortunately they're too late for that.
---
You’re going to let down
---
&gt; What they find is a good and balanced Survival game where you can just ignore the survival portions if you choose to and play it like a sandbox with friends
---
So, first off...
---
&gt; good and *balanced* Survival game
---
&gt; ***balanced***
---
I disagree with this so much, I can't even bring myself to call the game *un*balanced because that implies there's some sort of state of balance that you can reach by changing a few things around. Second of all...
---
&gt;you can just ignore the survival portions
---
I'm wondering what you mean by survival here. I consider the hunger, thirst, and condition systems to be survival elements, and unless I'm missing something incredibly obvious, they're mandatory.
---
We're already in that situation. Every single one of the non cosmetic items has been put into the game to circumvent mechanics they put into the game to begin with.
---
Oh, I see, thank you for telling me this
---
How exactly does one play Cyberpunk2077 while having a normal life.
---
Asking for a friend.
---
I just wanna beat people with a fishing rod tbh
---
Instead of hopping around looking for weights in gyms, jump in excavator and head to lucky hole mine. 
---
In 15 minutes you will come out with enough ore to break down into 1000+ lead
---
then spend the next week farming West Tek for the steel to make it all into ammo.
---
I think it would be worth it if we could be allowed to change the way the game operates in our private worlds.  
---
Like allowing camps to be built anywhere, or no build limit. Higher or lower spawn rates. Things like that.
---
Isn't that what everyone does with services like Nitrado etc
---
idk, I have both PC and PS4 and I see the same people on every day.
---
Fantastic news
---
Be90% 10mm smg
---
It was originally billed as late aug/sept and they thought it would be cute to push it back to the 1 year anniversary. Now it’s clear they’re still nowhere close to having it ready.
---
Dude I got a explosive 90% reduced weight limb damage 50 cal
---
Lol friends and I have been saying this whenever one of us gets something shitty since the game came out.
---
Ghouls are all that will be left of humanity by the time they release wastelanders so this shouldn't be a surprise.
---
But what if it doesnt spawn for me in the first place? Am I just SOL for 20 hours if someone else snagged it?
---
Poorly. 1000 scrip got me an awful lot of junk legendaries.
---
But the end result is that 20 years from now when the servers go dark you can play the game unlike alot of "games a service" that WONT work once the plug is pulled
---
Yes, because some suit who is looking at the data isn't going to be able to immediately tell that hmmmmm..... These don't sell well as stand alones..... Only in bundles...... 
---
That must mean they sell well! 
---
You think they just get a sheet that says "We SoLDZ lOtZ of Repair KitZ. TRUST!"?
---
Like for fucking real. There's a reason my service provider dropped every home phone service except basic service..... No one buys them. Yet! They were in every tv, internet and phone bundle!
---
Yet somehow, through magic. Some one deciphered the mystery of stand alone sales vs bundles.....
---
I'll have to get back to you on that one lol
---
The release date month was on their own website. If they change it, that is a lie. Plain and simple. Do you honestly believe what this company has been doing with this game release fair and honest? They already lied to us like that nylon bag. They are not to be trusted anymore until they have proven themselves. The fact that I'm the consumer puts me in a position to vote with my money. The way they have been treating their core base has been dog shit. I never bring up my right to vote with my money unless I have had my trust broken and my time disrespected. If this company decides words dont matter or customer complaints don't matter. Or the fact that they don't hold themselves accountable for this product. Then plain and simple, this game doesn't matter. I sound like someone who really enjoyed the fallout series up until now. If this company wants to act like EA or some kind of monopoly, then they can swollow their own piss and shit they give to the community and leave us to find another company more suitable to our needs. I find it so enjoyable that you get a kick by calling me an entitled consumer, when in fight I'm mad at the tyrant behavior this company has been acting like. You're a boot licker, I get it. You just bend over and let them reach for your wallet. As for ignoring the realities of the game, that reality is that this game really doesn't deserve my time or money nor my patience anymore. They had a thousand chances to make this game right and nothing short of making a beautifully crafted brand new fallout game or elder scrolls is enough to make up for this travesty of trust being broken. It's not just the date change. Its every little thing they do is a fuck up and at some point you can no longer support a game company. I was a huge Bethesda fan. I made my wife a big fan of them. We spent countless hours involved in their games. Hell we even ate junk for a while when we made our first pre orders and kept pre ordering since. We sunk our souls into the worlds they were making. Tattoos even. But at some point this company decided none of that matters and the community is just a walking atm. If this was a chick, divorce papers couldn't come soon enough. I already uninstalled this game and I will NOT pre order any game of theirs until their reputation is back on track. Nothing short of an amazing fallout or elder scrolls game. Period.
---
&gt;This is exactly what they should have done. So much BS and drama would be avoided.
---
No they are useless. I'm literally using them for no other reason than to use them. It's not like I lack the mats to repair my stuff 4748 times ....
---
Generally there is a time for it to respawn after someone has gotten theirs for the day. Pretty sure youre just struggling because of playing during what id assume is prime time
---
Kinda hoping someone figures out some sort of self hosted server...I gave up playing...got to annoying.
---
Facebook is the only place you can talk about PvP without the entitled brigade losing their 650 carryweight minds.
---
Oh, probably, I've been on since 6pm east coast time
---
Lmao. Plans change...but that was also said by a person, not an official statement by the company. They also said back in early spring that they would be putting utility items into the AS, and I'm perfectly good with that. Either way, they do give you the option to get atoms without paying one cent, you just have to not buy every shiny bauble that comes along. If more people had the self control to actually save their atoms their wouldn't be nearly so much crying. In the end if you dont like it there are plenty of other games for you to play
---
Nope. Always billed as fall.
---
If you need help making a mule let me know. I transfer caps and items for a price. 300 caps and as many nula colas as you can donate!
---
No ps4
---
I have put so much money into this game it is ridiculous, but they have gone and done it now with the Atomic Shop BS.   
---
This whole dev team needs to be flushed, I don't even care how good wastelanders is at this point, they have totally failed the community in every other way and blatantly lied to all of us.
---
I’m nearly level 50 though
---
Just adding the *always*
---
Naw, your boi helped fan the hate flames early on when it wasn't even really merited like it is now.
---
Well cash them in and get some more!
---
I fully believe it’s on purpose. Every week there is one bugged challenge or one so impossibly stupid (hunter/hunted in a atomic shop costume) so you don’t get the atoms and have to spend real money to get that limited time item that, but then release a better variant of it right after it goes away (skull gas mask/ skull gas mask with helmet)
---
the games so cheap to purchase it might as well be got my third copy(returning for the third time cuz i just cant keep away from FO and i never hit endgame)for like 5 bucks
---
I do the raids everyday dog who you kidding? You dont lose any junk for that very reason
---
This a bold faced lie. Wow was updated constantly with new content early on.
---
Yeah. I'm a boot locker for not liking the tool every fallout 76 hate sheep bowed to when he often reported on blatent speculation from data mining and just regurgitated Reddit posts? 
---
His pre 76 stuff was great. 
---
Then he turned into a tool. How are those lunch boxes he implied we were getting 7 months ago.
---
Am I the literal only one just waiting for Floaters more than anything else? I want to see what they look like ingame so badly
---
&gt; And who the heck buys scrap and repair kits?
---
Lots of people, apparently. Don't look at me though, I haven't even purchased the Fridge or Scrapbot. And the only times I spent real-world money on Atoms was for the Quakecon and summer bundles, where they sold 1500 atoms for $10. In total I've spent only $60 on this game, but I've bought most of what I actually wanted from the Atom Store with Atoms from in-game challenges.
---
Feel cute damnit
---
No. It was not lol

---
Original roadmap
---
Haha yeah it's going to take a while to clear my inventory. I did get an ok-ish fixer to play around with though, nothing godly trait wise but good enough to finally try it out.
---
So adding crit damage stacks without diminishing returns?
---
Probably bigger Money making a pvp off-shoot mode of NW with game modes like free for all, team deathmatch, conquest, king of the hill, capture the flag.  They can do Battle Royale with 52 players on a partitioned portion of the map, why not two teams of 26 using preset loadouts?  It'd attract a whole new world of pvp only players.
---
I'm just worried private servers will be Battlefield 4 style and cost like $100 to rent one for 6 months.
---
That's a big yes or simply just have the existing clocks do this.
---
Might get a bit annoying with the cuckoo clock xD
---
I think they mean the actual time in game not in real life. So when it's night in game, it would show the appropriate time instead of 9:47 like all of the other camp clocks
---
You don't even know the details yet you are already making assumptions of how this is going to work.
---
At this point, all the "feedback," and suggestions people make on this sub will just be new atomic shop items. P2W or not, sucks we have to drop 700 atoms every time they add something the community suggested months ago. Looking forward to dropping 700 for the new canning station the guy suggested here. "Passing it along to the team," yeah, I bet, lol.
---
Console players with the "game sharing" garbage are mostly the same also
---
Don't worry, we don't need fishing anymore, they got rid of survival mode.
---
How so? It was pretty merited at the time. The game was very broken at release and it still is over a year later
---
Okay, cool, so playing more towards higher crit damage more often and not more penetration?
---
Nothing respawns at the stations where my mules are parked. I played with one for three levels last weekend for something different, and his station was refreshed with the normal loot after that.
---
Just got a 3 star lvl 50 explosive fixer today for the first time very excited about that, was hoping to get another one but ended up getting a bunch of black powder weapons purveyor must have been caught in a time warp thinking it was the 1800. Going to go hunt some rebels tonight lol
---
Whenever my friend switched one of his boxes to a server I'm fairly sure he aimed for high CPU thread count and something to do with a memory controller + high speed SSD.
---
Wasn't cheap. Definitely takes a pretty penny to host recently made games.
---
I have 3 different characters with 3 totally different load outs and play styles, but the key part about each is sticking to his class or role and mitigating perk swaps. I have a crafter main who is the heavy gunner and power armor build, this guy has a wide arsenal of explosive weaponry and lasers and is very good at support and suppressing crowds. Kind of squishy out side of power armor but can mess some stuff up. My second is a stealth sniper type, I kill stuff before it has a chance to know I'm there. This guy is a ninja and very good at cleaning out buildings without a trace. My final character is a berzerker. This play style is a little different from normal play styles as I utilize cover a lot more and and depend on stealth to hide quickly. I'm a little headstrong as this rogue class as I expect to die often but it gives the game a different challenge than my "built" characters. Zerker relies heavily on damage mitigation and luck to stay alive. Each character also has a differen personality and "karma" alignment in my head.
---
I'm sorry dude. I tried but if you can't see it, I can't help you.
---
Good stuff! I usually offer to do it if someone is asking for help getting that pricey plan.
---
Boo hoo. Good Lord you guys need to get a life. Just don't buy it. Crying on Reddit does nothing. Go outside and play a sport. It's a video game people.
---
Interesting. Maybe I need to play a little longer and loot more before going back
---
Hi all, I just started fallout 76 tonight for the first time. After I left the vault no further quests or objective appeared, I Googled the story quest line and first contact is ment to be the first mission, but I'm getting no way point for it or is it showing up in the mission section of the pip boy. Any suggestions.
---
Lol, i mean LOL.
---
5k scrip, went well. 3 fixers, bloodied, furious, medic, some awesome heavies including at least to vampire mini guns and aa ffr Gatling plasma. Also, a whole bunch of script waiting to happen
---
&gt; so long as prices are reasonable. 
---
Hahahaha!
---
Oh, you were serious?
---
There's a favorites wheel on consoles and you can interact with it while running/sprinting. 
---
Not everyone is aware of that last part though.
