Red Dead is one million times better than 76 let's be real
---
---
---
But if they did it to one another... Now that would be amazing.
---
I found that they are not good enough to take up a constant spot as perk card - there are much better luck perks imo - 
---

---
and keeping gear repaired isn’t that hard - weapon artisan/fix it good/white Knight are a better solution for me because I can just throw them on when I’m repairing and then put more useful always-on cards.  
---
That being said - I always just try things out and see how they work for my particular build and play style - what doesn’t work well for me may work great for you so try it out and see what you think.
---
there's no profit to be made if the game becomes a barren wasteland of hackers.
---
they were *forced* to fix it in order to maintain their cashflow positive.
---
I'm not suprised people are getting scammed this late into the game. Maybe this will help you guys learn what kind of greedy corporate company you may be dealing with
---
If you’re actually going to make this a thing about gun control because you can’t justify playing a shitty game go for it. But there’s more then enough reason to own a gun, and as per not having targets you know I can print targets out or buy cases if hundreds for like 10 bucks? Can’t seem to find the comment so I’ll post it here but that was some grade A autism. Exactly what I’d expect from someone who plays this game.
---
They broke the ToS (both the seller and the buyer), so nothing to be done about it.
---
Caveat emptor as they say.
---
I've heard the rumors that they still exist
---
I doubt that there's a reliable way for Bethesda to tell if someone paid RL $$ or not.  
---
I suspect what will happen is anyone who lost anything to this whole escapade who winds up sending in a ticket will get some kind of reimbursement regardless of how they acquired the items that got stolen.
---
The basic source code for the cheat is on UC if you are interested.
---
it would be.  But this isnt the 90s, there are no hacker wars over kung fu theatre at 3am anymore.
---
You must really love the taste of Todd Howard's cum.
---
Imagine being as delusional as 90% of the people on this reddit. FO76 is a low-budget asset flip trash dumpster fire, no one is gonna go to jail over this hack and more hacks will come just so they can lick your tears some more. This isn't Fortnite or any other high profile game, it's \*Fallout 76\*  
---
Get ahold of your grip on reality, incel delusions at its finest ;P
---
I had mostly 90% weight reduction weapons, use weight reduction cards, a full set of unyielding, being bloody to 5% health, high capacity backpack, with nerd rage, and mutations my carry weight was 530lbs.
---
Charming.
---
Typical response from Fallout 76 redditors.
---
I appreciate that, I really do. I am getting tons of pushback and everybody has this defeatist attitude. They say that they're doing what they can to send a message to Bethesda. But obviously it's not getting to them. It's getting to the point where I'm really not blaming Bethesda anymore. 
---
At some point you got to punch the bully back and if you don't... well...
---
I really am trying to make Bethesda and Fallout 76 and the community better and stronger. Unite all of us  to get their attention so they'll listen to  what we want.  So that both sides  can be grow, evolve, and just be better. Yet nobody seems to want to participate so it's just like, fuck it. If we're going to be this submissive maybe we deserve a broken game, crappy nylon bags, and plastic-shelled rum.
---
I would help ya if I didn’t have my gremlin of a child. Sounds like lots of fun though 😂
---
Aww is that any way to greet someone wanting time get into the game
---
so is this fixed or not?
---
\&gt;500 players is not a "few".  
---
That is sixty percent of your current playerbase.
---
This is a shame. The metaphor lost me unfortunately, but I get what you're saying.
---
Send a hitman.
---
They never seem to activate for me, not enough anyway.
---
not entirely. you can still place items in other people's inventories, but not take.
---
its one of the first scenes in "Hackers" a mid 90s cult film about hackers.  Angelina Jolie's first movie.
---
Cool. See you later then.
---
I'mma just going to enjoy playing 76 with my friends. You can go back to being sad and lonely in FO4.
---
SPOT ON!!!
---
These people are IRL scum. It's not just messing with people in a game, they're mentally twisted in the real world.
---
Can you imagine if they're married? Have kids? Or are a kid themselves? They're the bullies in school, the ones we all tolerated, until they went too far, and broke their nose. Only problem with them in cyber space, you can't break their noses, and they love it!
---
The criminal mind is the same in an online game as IRL, they're twisted people, with skewed ideas of right and wrong. And like you said, their lives for the last year has been to hate a game they don't even play, other than to cause grief to others who are playing and enjoying it. I'd hope that if Bethesda can track these hackers down, they delete their accounts, and block their ISP for life. Not sure if you can screen record, like you can on the PS4, but it's easy to report them on PS4, because it's constantly recording blocks of video, I have mine set to 15 min intervals. That way, whatever is happening, I can save the entire incident, and send it to Bethesda when sending a report.
---
And for those wondering if it works, yes it does! While Bethesda doesn't disclose what they did to the individual, the reply lets me know it was taken care of.
---
There's an old saying; ***"Evil thrives when good men do nothing."*** In order to stop these jerks, we must be vigilant in recording, and reporting them when they commit such ignorant acts.
---
Isn't the daily average 33,000?
---
No I’m just attacking you as a person now because we can’t talk about fallout here because you don’t know anything about fallout ... oh you did watch 50 YouTube videos , read 21 articles oh and followed 6 Reddit posts .... ( let me know if I’m wrong on the numbers ) 
---
“ you have no real target “ 
---
Oh WeLl I CAn PRInT CarBoARD TarGETs To shoot AT f0r 10 bUCKKS 
---
Bro your actually nothing more than a walnut 😂😂😂😂
---
It seems like all tamable creatures that become scorched jump in level. Deathclaws go from 21 to 91, radtoads from 5 to something (I can't remember), but they should go back to their original level after a server hop.
---
True, I feel like people would be less pissed at them taking the servers down. But there would still be some complaining.
---
I have a  LVL 15 2\* B25 handmade on that build.  Bloodied, unyielding armor, and stealth boys.  never used any hacks or scripts,  but thanks    
---
I can't make you PVP, you have to hit me back.  You thought because you were a higher level with your TSE whatever and your sentinel armor that you could beat a level 17 easy peasy right?   Then when you get your butt peeeed in, its time to call hacks or cheats bla bla, truth is, you are not very good at the game.   I ran into the guy who was stealing inventories, I also had items taken from me, and the REAL KICKER HERE IS.... WAIT FOR IT.... ITS NOT BODEGA EITHER!
---
Just to be clear, we aren't 100% out of the clear on PlayStation. Modded PlayStations would still possibly be able to do the same thing, although
---
1. It's incredibly different, and incredibly unlikely
---
2. Because of the difficulty to do so, there would only be a couple of people with the ability. And IF they did have the hack, the chances of running into them would be like bad-luck-lottery
---
FUCKING LOL
---
Thanks. I'll actually go take a look at it later.
---
I was one of the fools who paid full price pre-order and played in beta. Unfortunately the graphics make me nauseous so I can only play in short bursts 😭
---
If it makes you feel any better, I hate running into people I run with as well! Even if I'm 100% on my game, there's no telling how it will turn out.
---
Nice meeting you on more agreeable terms! :)
---
Nintendo dude get it right lol
---
Imagine playing fallout 76. 
---
[This comment has been brought to you by fallput 4 gang]
---
Come, I'll like to see what they'll say this time to defend Beth.
---
Oh really! Knowing my bloody luck I’d manage to run into them. 
---
Thanks for the input my man 🤙
---
If you were not around the computer world back in the 90s, most of the lingo will be lost on you when they get into dialup modem baud rates, and praising the 486 intel chips.
---
A few people? 500 is quite a big number...
---
I was about to ask if it was a good time to give the game another try, but I think I'm going to wait a bit.
---
Like always..."Investigating the problem" when its a known fact and "Only affected a few players"...downplaying thier incompetence and allowing this to happen. I'm sure those 532 players on that one video alone don't appreciate being called a small number...and those are just the ones we know about. There are a lot of players that take playing Fallout 76 everyday seriously, like life and death serious, and could potentially cause physical harm to themselves or others over having their inventories stolen! Including items that they actually paid real cash for from the Atomic Shop. This Fire just keeps burning hotter and brighter every month.
---
easily the best comment on this dumpster fire of a sub reddit...i'd give u gold but im poor

---
You realize you can have fun with your friends by lighting a bag of dog shit on a doorstep right? 
---
Like a said, limited intelligence. 
---
Please get your head out of your ass
---
You’re a bit late to the parade. Already addressed.
---
&gt;It's not about winning. It's about serving them with the lawsuit. 
---
That's just pointless bureaucracy.
---
I played Age of Empires and Dune around that time frame haha. Probably not old enough to even watch that movie at the time.
---
StarCraft multiplayer on dialup was doable until someone called your house. Ha.
---
12.7mm pistol and throwing spears.
---
So... Fallout 4? Lol
---
&gt;While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected
---
ThERe ArE M0re than EnOUGH reasons for Owning an ARSENAL Of GÛns , I need to make sure I have an entire Arsenal in order to protect my self and teach my loved ones about gun safety ... oh and have fun ! That’s an important reason , us American men need guns to have fun ! No guns = no fun
---
Why would the fix even need to go to consoles when it does not even effect them.  The pc version just had the equivalent to a nuke dropped on it, because of hacking and you are complaining that the fix costed your money ,Grow up.
---
I was so hyped for this game. Ended up never buying it, but I am still following this shitshow from Bethesda. I can’t look away it’s astonishing.
---
it is.. all you need is nerd rage + scrapper + chemist. 5 int. who cares about broken weapons when you can get so much free repair kits
---
Ditching the magic bullshit has been on my list since day 1 beta.
---
There's always fallout 4...
---
To address your edit: yes the game is currently buggy as hell and it played better a year ago than it does now and if it keeps getting worse we wont even have to ask these questions because its approaching unplayable and they know it whether they admit it officially or not. Concerning hacks, I wouldn't even be playing if I were a PC user because that's hopelessly out of control. I'm on XB1 it's not such a problem.
---
I wish duping were still around the drop rates from legendaries are fucking trash anyways lol
---
If I’m honest I could never finish Fallout 4, but it’s ok, because Bethesda didn’t either
---
I mean I’m just saying, my targets are whatever I, as a responsible gun owner who knows what he owns are weapons, chose them to be. Personally I chose to shoot at paper and game animals at the moment. The government doesn’t, and shouldn’t, have a right to tell me what to own.
---
 Now to say I don’t know the game let’s get something straight, I’ve played every fallout up until 76 and thought fallout 4 was the worst it could get. I think you know why I would say thought. At least obsidian could make a game.
---
Unyielding
---
There hasn't been any recorded incidents from my knowledge, and again, I highly doubt there will. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't possible and because there hasn't been problems on consoles YET, then there was no patch released for us.
---
Isn't it crazy knowing that people will still defend Bethesda? These people are so deluded that Bethesda can hold their families at gun point and they'll still try to justify their actions
---
I think one rank seems to be about all that's needed if you want to try them. Personally I just run queens and I can never use alll the repair kits. I repair everything all the time and I am still over 600 and still going up lol
---
Aw what a good sheep.
---
The first dupes were bad but the restaurant dupe was great, the one I'm referring to was the one where be lasers were duped to fuck
---
You didn’t see graphite on the ground because there wasn’t graphite on the ground!
---
The fact that people can have private servers and play alone proves it's possible.... 
---
But hey, nice try there. The only issue is it's paywalled by a shit subscription service. It's only a matter of time before someone finds a way around that issue. Be it a emulated server, or some sort of bypass.  
---
But my bet is the real reason no ones done that yet is because there's better games to play and mod. Why waste time trying to make a SP-Mode for FO76 when you can just make a mod for any other game that is already SP by default?
---
There's often one at Tanagra Town. It has a chance of being a sloth, deathclaw or fogcrawler. It'll be right near where you spawn in when fast travelling.
---
It's a shame. It's really not a bad game, they should have spent atleast 2 more years on the game.
---
Because you had a good time, doesn't mean others will.
---
Therefore, represent the game accurately to other people by acknowledging that it is buggy instead of deflecting and going.
---
"What? You mean normies will have lots of happy fun great times in Fo76?"
---
Click bait for old news
---
For semi auto and low to medium rare of fire weapons, they are not noteworthy.  Where Luck of the Draw shines is high rate of fire or multi-hit weapons (combat shotguns).  Each hit checks for proc chance, at base modified by Luck.  I have a 32 Luck, so it definitely helps keep my high ROF weapons going longer.  It doesn't make them unbreakable, but it means they can often keep going a lot longer through back to back fights when I forget to stop by a weapon bench.  Unfortunately the perk doesn't seem to over repair, even if you had those perks equipped.
---
I really feel sorry for those of you that put hours and hours in to this piece of shit you can never catch a break can you. If it isn't the game being buggy its people hacking your inventory, or glitchy patches/features, or highly sought after additions locked behind premium gates. 
---
Btw console players don't think you are immune, be a little vigilant hacks do exist on console its just no where near as widespread.
---
[removed]
---
Better sense. Leave and don't come back.
---
But he wouldn’t have been able to post his “Bethesda bad” rant
---
Not every gun is for protection, think of guns like golf clubs, you don’t use a nine iron as a driver. Same logic applies to guns, if you want to take a boar you wouldn’t use a .22, so logically you also wouldn’t use a .300 WinMag for shooting squirrel. You need more then one gun for that. Now factor in home defense, conceal carry, sporting, and more and you wind up with more then a couple. That’s just how it works.
---
I got as far as rebuilding liberty prime and then lost all interest. I’d be more into it if I knew what the ever loving f*ck the Institute’s goal was
---
Private servers are not single player so, nice try there doofus. You are still always connected to their multiplayer with constant checks to back home. The game can not run properly not connected to the bethesda servers.
---
_All_ recent hacks fixed today? Seems optimistic to me. If anything, it appears to be snowballing as hackers focus their attacks on the Christmas season. I've never seen anything like it in any other major service game, it's astonishing.
---
I'll still take 76 over that shit... Even with craziness that happens. Been a wild year for sure but have zero desire to hear the voice acting in 4.
---
aw man, that sucks.   hopefully they do a rollback for people who lost stuff.
---
good luck.
---
They have come out with announcement for the hack
---
Alright that made me laugh
---
I think the general gist is not wrong. We got an online game that has had one of the worst series of technical issues since day 0. I personally haven’t experienced a triple a game this flawed (excluding ones like no mans sky were promises weren’t kept and I never bought anthem). With technical issues that run this deep there are clearly issues with the engine, assets, and code. Sure a significant portion could be poor planning or understaffing but a manageable code base typically has less growing pains than what we have seen
---
Where is this threat coming from?
---
Don't insult Garrys Mod
---
You're late for the original hack, but on the bright side I'm sure that the hackers will have updated their code soon, so you're actually a little early for the next one!
---
Yeah it’s just a log in and transfer accounts issue though. Not actually muling stuff from one system to the other. Thx though
---
On a private server if you're the only player it is technically "SINGLE" player.  Just like in Elite Dangerous you can play Solo Mode which is a "Single player experience" even though you're still connected online. You just won't run into other players. 
---
Sooo yeah.
---
Incompetence.
---
lmfaooooooooooo this game was dead in the first month it came out! I'm surprised how many of your sheep stayed ahahahahha
---
PC version?
---
It’s not like it’s been dead for over a year now or anything.
---
yeah, I think he missed the joke...
---
You're too late, they already patched it. And it only affected PC, so thousands of console players barely even know this happened. PC may be on life support, but Fallout 76 is fine.
---
Can you mail me my three shackles pls
---
Even if it's fixed, the hackers will update their code in no time. Barring daily patches and code re-writes, there is no fixing this.
---
Seeing your items get stroked is glorious.
---
You don't get jokes do you?
---
What did you say to him?
---
Your PR team sucks. Way to go on the downplay guys! Amateurs...
---
While that does seem like an absurdly high number, it isn't hard to hit a few queen fights and steal from 10+ people in a few minutes at most. You do that for 8+ hours and you can rack up quite a lot and a lot of the people doing it are the types that play for many hours at a time griefing people before the hack came out.
---
I have real targets ! Game animals ... I definitely need to keep a gun with me in order to protect myself from cardboard targets , and game animals ! 
---
See the point here is you don’t need a gun you choose to have a gun in order to give you a sense of superiority over others ... a gun gives you confidence that you can’t build yourself as a person ... you have the government installed in order to protect you .. the chances of you ever ever using that gun on a real target is near nothing but you being the alpha American man with no life but to shoot paper targets , boost his ego and shit on a game you’ve never played won’t be able to comprehend anything I’ve said ... whatever getting off topic here I just needed some “ entertainment “ enjoy your day tough American man with an arsenal of weapons costing you a fortune that you could have put to ethical use 👋🏼
---
These are broken people who need to be stopped.  The only thing more broken are those who cheer them on simply because they are clever or connected. bethesda is a distant 3rd although i'm not excusing their code.
---
Well yeah. Imagine freaking out cause you monopoly money faded
---
Fact is gamers put WAY too much importance and time into gaming as a whole.
---
Right glad this hasn't made it's way to console yet.
---
The stealing hack was patched a couple of hours ago. Early tests show it no longer works after the patch. No reports of it showing up again yet.
---
Some hacker named erectban. I'm not sure what all systems are being hit but I know for sure its pc
---
One problem with that: the Dupers *ARE* the Hackers.
---
What do you mean people are getting wiped before they can dump their items?
---
Nah. Theres been too many issues that defy the corporate overlords arent providing them the tools to succeed. Not knowing your dated engine and making things safe and at times downright unplayable shows those on the ground floor are either lazy, unqualified or have given up on their jobs. Zenimax as a whole has shown with 76 how bad the company is run and staffed right down to this new hack all the way to the people sourcing those helmet bags. Ducking responsibility is childish they have jobs to do and at this point the failures have been to great and many to go its the CEOs fault.
---
My prices are set my dude. If someone turns around and flips it more power to them.
---
Thank god, I only just know learned about the hack itself. But that's somewhat a relief.
---
I mean I'm sure there are already a few vigilantes trying to.
---
&gt;Base Game = Singleplayer Worlds.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Secondary = Multiplayer Worlds both Public and Private.
---
This is what I was responding to. You literally can not have fallout 76 offline in it's current state. The game can not be played single player. You can run a private world but that is still not single player.  You can pirate elite dangerous and play it offline. You can not pirate fallout 76 and play it offline. Don't you think the crackers and modders would have already done it?
---
Admitting to breaking the TOS? I didn’t admit to breaking the TOS, and I haven’t / wouldn’t buy stuff with real money in Fallout
---
Are you sure? This seems much more helpful and less antagonistic than my experiences with Bethesda customer support.
---
true, it’s a painful game to play at times and it’s always getting some kind of outrage so that adds to the “let me login and see how fucked it is” drive to play. I can’t stop killing and looting - I’m basically a weight management can man. Living in Appalachia and knowing a good deal of the real places between Kentucky and WV, is a huge draw for me. I like the map and terrain.
---
The stealing hack appears to have been successfully patched today. It has been tested by "good" hackers and appears to be fixed. No word on any similar variants being released yet.
---
Yeah, I don't get what this smooth skin is complaining about. A little bit of..."downplaying" never hurt anyone just take some rad away and boom you're good. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
/s
---
IMHO Demolition Expert would be more useful.
---
No, this is precisely why they made private worlds subscription only; so they could sell a solution to a problem they created (or at the very least allowed to be created).
---
Yeah. You really makes me uncomfortable. I'm cringing right now.
---
But seriously what are you playing right now?
---
And YouTube vids??
---
Please don't post rumors. The patch was literally just implemented. Post a video if it's so recent that it's happening like... as you're posting it.
---
Okay lets talk about conceal carry, cops aren’t going to be everywhere at any time and thus it’s your responsibility to defend yourself. That’s just one use of a gun however. 
---
I never said I ‘needed’ a gun I said there were reasons. If you don’t think you need one then don’t own one. However as someone who hunts I’d rather have the most ethical means of taking game. And in terms of defense I’d rather have the most effective means there as well. If you own a gun to feel macho you have no business with a gun. 
---
Again, keep in mind the topic is a game that has never been and will never be a good game, and will continue to be broken as long as people buy from the shop.
---
Make sure all of the effected players get their 500 Atoms of compensation
---
Never happens to me could me platforms
---
Not many problems cant be fixed by whipping out your fatman
---
Lol this game is such shit fest, its kinda sad..kinda.
---
"A few"? "Only a small number"? Are you serious? One guy robbed 532 people in ONE VIDEO. Please do NOT downplay this issue, it's very upsetting that you continue to do so. This issue straight up makes PC version straight up unplayable, that is not a small thing.   
---
Dealing with new hacks is one thing, we can understand that, issues and cheats come up all the time in games. Using those terms to subtly downplay the problem as if it's nothing to worry about is QUITE another. You're quite shameless at this point, it's making me very upset.
---
It seems as if people are just trying to ruin the game for everyone else, I wouldn't be surprised if there is some sort of group dedicated for these type of hacks
---
Nope.
---
Bare in mind; Bethesda aren't the only ones that can patch their programs. The hackers are almost certainly updating their code to circumvent whatever 'fix' Bethesda's implemented. 
---
Fallout 76 PC is *never* going to be safe.
---
They did that to me at Morgantown. Low lvl was beating on me and annoying me so finally I turned around and armed myself as he ran out the door and as soon as I stepped through someone twice my level melted me with a legacy laser.
---
A few players?! I just saw a video where 1,000,000 players were affected! 1,000,000 I say! Give or take 999,499.
---
And yet the same people will continue to play this joke of a game. I'm hoping this situation will be a wake up call for them to get the fuck out and switch to another game.
---
I wouldn't have, if they had not made false advertisement about the type and content of the game.
---
Oh am aware of what can be substantiated and the **Straight Up Malarkey** beth tries to tell us
---
Ill shackle you up baby, ill even give you some shekels for the pleasure
---
In Russia, it is illegal to hack Russian citizens. 
---
However, it is actually legal in Russia to hack any non-russian citizen, the laws are notoriously lax in that regard. It's part of the reason that Russia breeds elite hackers, they can have meetups in broad daylight and train each other. All's fine and dandy as long as no russian citizens are being scammed.
---
I know, but they had what was coming to them
---
OY VEY
---
Not the first time I've seen that behavior with videos showing off hacks in multiplayer settings and ruining the game for the victims of said hacks. These people have their circlejerking corners in the comment sections. They are a disgusting part of gaming but at least comments can be ignored.
---
Who is selling the anti cheat software? How much money do they stand to make if Beth buys. Seems like this is a ransom attempt.
---
Seriously, the only one truly at fault right now is Badthesda. The creation game engine they used in 76 has been heavily modded for over 10 years by thousands of individuals. get this tho! They have ZERO anti-cheat software in 76. HA! If you wanted to set yourself up for abysmal failure, that's how you'd do it. 
---
Moders warned them how bad it could go if they didn't put up some safe guards over a year ago actually back last [Nov 2018 IGN Article](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/06/fallout-76-bethesda-is-aware-and-investigating-a-potential-huge-hacking-vulnerability). 
---
OMG this quote aged so well  
---
"Many of the claims in the thread are either inaccurate or based on  incorrect assumptions. The community has however called to attention  several issues that our teams are already actively tracking and planning  to roll out fixes for." 
---
At this point i think Badthesda is probably about to get hit with lawsuits. The sear amount of incompetence here is hilarious.
---
I Think it’s okay to carry assault weapons because it’s effective way of killing game !
---
Your nothing but a moron man just forget it
---
*Facepalm* You do realize there's two types of Singleplayer right? There's Online SP and Offline SP. 
---
Offline SP = No Net Connection Required
---
Online SP = You still need internet to play the game but you play alone as the ONLY PLAYER. 
---
In FO76 if you're a Whale who pays for the subscription you can play alone on a Private Server which is considered Online Singleplayer. It's STILL singleplayer just online....
---
And no I don't think they would have already done it. Try reading the earlier comment where I clearly stated "Why would they waste their time on this when there's already games is SP by default that they could mod?" I highly doubt anyone is gonna be willing to bypass Bethesdas BS to make an Emulated SP system for this game because the gameplay isn't worth the effort. I sure as hell wouldn't. If I wanna do that sort of thing I'll download the source materials for Star Wars Galaxies and host at home and play by myself, why?, because it's got a real story, gameplay, and progression.
---
I think you're in the wrong sub, bud.
---
regardless, this isn't even about gaming. it's about sheer incompetence.
---
Supposedly there is proof. LegacyKilla has a video using footage that’s not in the 8 minute version, the 500 number came from him too.
---
When the media forgot the game existed for a...month?
---
Seems like these "raiders" are also causing problems for other people as well.
---
Honestly, this feels a lot like Ultima Online where it was a constant horror show of hackers and other exploits.  Admittedly, some of UO's problems were just plain funny while others were equally horrible where people could lose entire castles or things they worked for months or years for.
---
You could probably deduce the goal on your own but they should have explained it.
---
The funny thing is EULA's are not actually legally binding, just expensive to push through the red tape that acts as a barrier.
---
Because it’s fun.
---
There's a lot of assumptions baked into this statement.
---
“A few” lol would love to see this game have a breakthrough like no mans sky, great updates community feedback but this. WOW!
---
Give the PC players a break, be glad this can’t happen on consoles (yet as I know of).  How do console players pay for pc fixes?
---
And [wears your outfit](https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk?t=328) for the rest of his savage heist.
---
rip this games reputation even more.
---
You’re now assuming what I carry to take game or what I carry to defend myself. Never did I make any indication towards either.
---
But then again, if you’re this furious over someone telling you how much fun they’ve had seeing a trash fire I can’t wait to hear about what happens after your inventory gets swiped by a scripty boy
---
I think the more important question is: Does anyone have even the slightest bit of sympathy for them? 
---
(No, no they don't. Nor should they)
---
This is one of the reasons why I just don’t fight people in Fo76. There’s usually some strange catch to it
---
Yeah, no matter whether it's at my camp or a workshop, my turrets always immediately go hostile on poor Santatron.
---
I got a chuckle from this.
---
I mean... ngl... I think Donald Trump retiring to stream video games on Twitch would be hilarious. I would genuinely watch that.
---
I couldn’t honestly figure it out. What was the purpose of replacing people with synths? Best I can come up with would be to control the factions and form a new government but they all seemed way to happy staying in their hole underground
---
I just made a new person
---
Slow fucking clap bro.
---
Battlefront II at the moment! Have you tried it?
---
There’s a program that people use to examine files of programs called a decompiler.  It displays the coding (instructions) for the program.
---
Or you know they could just go the more sane route and check logs to see who got an impossibly insane amount of loot in an impossible amount of time.
---
I need to remember to mark this haha, I'm on PC. :)
---
Idk, I asked the same thing. Looks like everyone is just getting downvotes. This subreddit is so stupid.
---
I don’t want them to kill the game. I really enjoy playing it and am looking forward to wastelanders. I’m sorry you don’t enjoy playing the game but there are many many people that do enjoy it.
---
They can rollback, they did it for the people who lost their gear with the 94 inventory bug a few months back.
---
Whats with the furry suit?
---
I had an idea.. maybe this could work.
---

---
Which do you use?
---
Yeah it's not like there was a slew of previous issues that suggested investing time in this game was a bad idea...
---
all american marksman carbine
---
Do you know another online game that's like Fo76 that I could play?
---
Only a small number of players affected? You only have a small number of players left Bethesda. Fuck off with your PR bullshit. Just admit you guys as a company have no clue how to run a online title.
---
Yes.
---
I try not to let it get to me because they had survival mode taken away and some people really enjoy pvp. I just try to steer clear of people if I'm packing important junk, but for the most part I try not to have much on me and keep pacifist on.
---
As I understand it, if they catch you out in the big let’s say, they walk up and search you like a loot box and take whatever you have on your person. 
---
If they walk into your camp they can also grab anything from your stash box. 
---
I’m no expert but that’s what the video actions seemed like.
---
Hell what fix I didn't get any download or see any word on the launcher of it...
---
Do that alot. La chaim on you showin the schmucks up!
---
I dont understand how we had to pay for it. Can you please elaborate? 
---
Supposedly console servers never even went down. From what i was reading in this sub, only pc servers and players were effected, and only pc servers were taken offline to fix it. As far as i know, nothing has changed on console. As far as i know, it never even went down today. I may be wrong as i havent been home, but im 100 percent lost about what youre trying to say.
---
That’s very clearly fake? It jumps up and down several thousand every instant you refresh lol
---
"Minimal effort"... Id wager it took more effort adapting a strictly singleplayer engine developed over the past ~20 years and changing it to multiplayer was the hardest path they could have taken. 
---
Adopting a new engine with multiplayer functionality built in from the beginning would have been far easier.
---
It wasn’t an update but (I believe) a patch to the servers directly. I’m assuming you don’t know what was happening then?
---
For the Idiot in the room in terms of Game development like Me, why doesn't Fallout 76 use some sort of Protection like Easy Anticheat, Battle eye etc, I can't understand if it's because it would cause issues with the game or Bethesda simply just doesn't want to do this?
---
That would be nice. Gettin' my stuff back.
---
Lol
---
Hmmm in that case, then it kinda sounds as if they wanted the hack to go live. I bet, they thought they could gain some sympathy aspect of PR or something. Which unfortunately at this point, is pure fantasy. Nobody will give BGS anymore benefit of the doubt or empathy after the fo76 nightmare.
---
Also don't accept random team invites.  Two people inv you and when you join one leaves, they initiate pvp with each other(and you since your now a teammate) and then they kill you and loot you. Once was all I needed of that.
---
I'll do it for 3,000,000 atomic shop points
---
 "While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected"  Guys! This means that we have to affect a lot more players so that they will fix this EVENTUALLY.  
---
Bethesda will not fix this immediately, It's a win for them.  To escape this hack you have to subscribe to fallout 1st. "wink, wink" So what's their incentive?
---
Best way to stop this is to not play the game.
---
Now that the hotfix has been instituted, hasn't the continued occurrence of players using this hack no longer an issue?
---
What?
---
downvoted for linking to shit like ING game "journalists"
---
There is nothing wrong with liking fallout 76 i just cant liike it
---
Changing over everyone's workflow and retraining for a new engine is time consuming. They also wanted to add in net code to their existing engine anyway, which was a monumental task in its own right.
---
Allow me to be the first down vote. This isn't funny.
---
Idk if the game can come back from a army of hackers, this is so unprecendented.
---
Location- Either on-top of the giant tree, above a waterfall west of Dyer Chemicals.
---
Or - the far north east corner of the map is a slight pre-built of treehouse, than can be built around.
---
Decor- Mothman cultist camp stuff. Bones chimes. Weapon racks with cultist weapons or sheepsquatch staff.
---
I always enjoy a good fight, but when a low level rocks up and starts hitting me out of the blue, 9/10 it’s a trap. That’s why I try to only fight Lvl 80 and above, but I get you, the temptation is so strong to kill an aggressive low lvl. Lol
---
*”We need... The Sword Of a Thousand Truths...”*
---
Yoy'd have to be living under a rock to not know or have heard about what's going on. I'm just saying no way I'm jumping back on anytime soon when there is no evidence of a fix.
---
But I’m being serious !
---
It’s Christmas time man enjoy your family don’t worry about games.
---
Easy anti cheat.
---
Hardware and IP bans.
---
Compensate all players, whether affected or not
---
Fix the game itself
---
Bethesda posted on the sub they took the servers offline. They’re back up and they said they finished their work. But you’re not wrong. That’s literally all we have. No patch notes of any kind
---
Look at the vids. Loot live players from 300 meters away even, Leave them naked of all items
---
That is what bethesda would say. I say we burn him.
---
Lol, only funny because I know you're not serious. Kinda sounds like something they would do though.
---
Chicken shit over here. I am just watching the sub at this point and the social tab to see who is on.
---
Yeah that’s cool and all, but no-one is forcing you to play the game, asking them to kill a game that so many people enjoy just because you don’t like it is pretty selfish. I mean can’t you just play another game and ignore fallout 76?
---
Now that I think about it I dont think I'll be playing much anymore.. This is never going to be a safe product.
---
That seems like a very good idea
---
My wife and kids play fo76 together. We enjoy it.
---
Ill let them know you think they are morons.
---
Merry Christmas!
---

---
Lmfao do it.. these sheep would buy it hahahahhaahahha
---
I don't think anyone would give a shit if teleport hacks existed in FO76, I mean, you literally can teleport to hundreds of places already.
---
If only there was a way we could force them to make changes that would better the game experience.
---
"Hack anything.  Go everywhere"
---
Unlikely. Bethesda can barely approve an official response to a disaster after it has reached a critical point.
---
So are consolse players safe?
---
You get full set of ultracite for completing BOS quest. You can now find the plans in asylum upstairs on one of the terminals.
---
I didn't even see the servers go offline if they did it was quick as hell.
---
at least the item spawning glitch hack was funny but this......some men just want to watch the world burn
---
You can do practically anything with this engine as the hackers have shown. They just choose not to help for some reason 🤷🏻‍♂️.
---
I still play, but I'm long past defending.
---
Yep! I'm not a SWs fan. It's fun I think and is included in Origin. But no my cup of tea.
---
Also don’t shop and vendors who have shops hanging over cliffs. I’ve had them pull the floor from under me and steal my junk after I’ve fallen to death.
---
I could see people spending money if the game has no dlc but normally dlc is expected to be paid for. So example would be no season pass but someone planned to buy one. Then that money just goes to the game none the less. Plus I did the math a long while back on the rate in which legendaries dropped, I could see why ppl dont wish to grind endlessly for poor loot, and could just buy good duped loot. Other mmo games are on top of this, but since the company doesnt care about fo76, as it was never planned to be a big game, just a cash grab. Then they arent pressed to stop it.
---
Invites off, hmm? Better check that, only ever been solo.
---
I hope they actually give everyone who lost their items their stuff back and they don’t just receive some atoms as compensation.
---
Only 500 atoms to get your stuff back ,we will throw in horse armour too.
---
I got a toad eye before as well. Don’t remember how I got it.
---
lol you have not taken this game as a hole seriously!
---
because it costs money. when people say Bethesda is greedy they're not joking.
---
Should I suggest that they watch the NoClips video, where they explain how different this code is compared to the previous iterations of the engine?  
---
Naw. .  People are still going to bitch.  
---
This coding is as much the same as it's predecessors, as Unreal (whatever number they're on now) is to the first unreal engine.
---
Shop in power armor. Another hard lesson I learned
---
Same people
---
Bethesda is already safe, they wont be seen in a court. :(
---
Those are called “stupid”
---
This.
---
Yea I’ve been doing that ever since. I learned the hard way and have had people just leave the server when I jump into power armor before shopping. I’m also weary anytime someone who owns the base is watching me shop.
---
No. To do that you would need two Xbox's and two disks. I'm not sure about Live accounts as far as profiles if you could be logged into the same profile on two different devices.
---
I mean he’s a game journalist right? A lot of these bugs are a pretty big deal, why wouldn’t he report on them?
---
To be honest, it wouldn't surprise me, either. There are certainly groups dedicated to hating the game.
---
Out of curiosity, have you done any FO4/SSE modding? It's a *stupid* system. Like, *really* stupid. Honestly, I can completely believe that there was nothing the devs could have done to pre-empt these hacks, and a lot of the bug issues just make me think "Yeah I can totally see that happening". It genuinely feels like the engine is actively working against you half the time. If this had been basically any other game engine, I'd probably be agreeing with you, but I have a decent amount of first-hand experience with modding Skyrim so I can have a bit of sympathy for just how bad that engine is. So often you just have absolutely no way of predicting what the issues will be.
---
You're telling me we've been dealing with the A-team for the past year?
---
low effort
---
Jobs? Bethesda never did their jobs.
---
It has been tested as thoroughly as possible immediately following the patch. There's no word on any other hacks like this coming in the near future.
---
Except instead of recovering your items, it just wipes your inventory again.
---
Not literally but addiction is still an addiction. May not be destructive like the negative effects of heroin or the financial effects. But addiction is still the same. Like food is all food. Just tastes different with each type, kinda thing
---
Run up to people naked on an alt while you wait.
---
How bout a single action revolver ivory grip instead it’s pretty rare
---
But also glad to hear your recovering. Keep up the streak
---
I mean, I've been negatively affected because I'm home for Christmas vacation and was hoping to play and there's no way in hell I'm logging in while this is going on.
---
Everyone is affected.  Bethesda's response to this is clown college level material.
---
I doubt it.
---
He's an idiot. Just down vote him and move on.
---
Hell no. I give it a day at most before the hackers have updated their script and we're back to square one.
---
On the bright side. Rip all the duped and ebay bought weapons.
---
You’re right, that’s nuts. 100 Atoms is much more reasonable! Thanks Beth!
---
I only accept random invites if they message me in advance and tell me why they’re inviting me, per say to fast travel without paying caps or something
---
Everyone has been affected.  I can guarantee (and you would know) that a huge number of players aren't even logging in because they're scared of this happening.  Just because I didn't get my stuff jacked doesn't mean lots of us haven't been following this as it has developed and has stayed away from the game in the interim.
---
The oldest/lamest trick in the book! I usually let them do it, seek revenge then kill them both if I can.
---
OK, I'm lost, where do I find this setting I'm on PC so I'm guessing this is some console setting?
---
Observe
---
Yeah, I try to go outside or something whenever someone is shopping mine. But sometimes ill just step back to a corner out of the way. With the current event going on I usually watch them because if they purchase a high price item or multiple others I drop them a couple gifts.
---
Part-time lurker (keep hoping the game gets better) but Yong has every right to comment on the game so long as the game keeps ending up in the news.
---
Like, I don't need to work at bank to comment on a bank robbery. Or have to be a part of a fandom to comment on a piece of media. He's a commentator, he's going to commentate lol
---
Bethesda's not going to do a f#$%ing thing for people who lost their inventory. Mark my words.
---
I don’t really have sympathy for them either. It’s a stupid decision to do such a thing and breaks the TOS. I was just curious about what’d happen to them. That’s all
---
I tryed to ignore it but not a month without some form of controversy and i think it could be good but it isnt
---
Always smooths things over with the old lady
---
That’s good of you! I don’t have enough patience to keep a bunch in my vendor and just sell on Reddit lol
---
hardware bans do nothing, poke around on unknowncheats to see how stupidly easy they are to dodge.
---
It's more than likely the community person writing this doesn't really understand either the scope of the hack or the game itself.  When you get into these communities, I had a friend who wrote stories for a popular gaming website.  She played games occasionally, but when she started writing I doubt she logged in for more than 2-4 hours a week.  Lots of people working social media and other positions in gaming companies don't even play the games.
---
If anything, these events make people want to play more. Doesn't matter how many e-celebs mock it. Doesn't matter if it's shit. A dumpster fire is fun to be a part of.
---
You won't. At most you'll get a handful of Atoms, and even that would be a surprise.
---
What is justice?
---
A Christmas miracle.
---
The problem I have is I'm a fat man and have to whip out a little boy.  It doesnt work.
---
Me no idiot me smart !
---
Honestly I could see that happening, and the very lacking response to this as well proves this theory
---
I never break into people's cars or homes if they have those though, so they must work 🤷‍♂️
---
It's a bad joke theory. Bethesda has been lax on proactive anti-cheat measures since before the game even launched. The more Bethesda tries to fix these problems after they've exploded, the worse this will get. There's almost nothing to even deter even the most incompetent cheater. The door is wide open for exploitation in 76,and Bethesda needs to slam it shut. Now.
---
I have a theory that this is the dumbest theory, not joking. ;)
---
The first multiplayer Elder Scrolls? You’re kidding, right?
---
The stories in fallout 76 are incredibly sad. The real life contamination, pollution, and destruction in West Virginia are shocking.
---
The Fallout 76 gameplay is ok. I don't mind none of the problems. I am on xb1.
---
For compensation and a means of apology I hear for a limited time all Excavator Power Armor skins will be 10% off. That's right, all of them!
---
In all seriousness though if it is atoms I quit. Maybe I'll dust off a book.
---
They used to be junk then they got removed so they are nothing now
---
I think the best scenario would be to move on to playing other games like a sane person and spending your time enjoying things over hating them.
---
I guess so. I was never "most people". People have been telling me no since I was 14. Proved them wrong. 
---
Bill Gates once told me "never ask for permission, ask for forgiveness" Its been one of my principles ever since.
---
No one's getting anything back. Bethesda's been quite consistent in their unwillingness to restore items, even when it was their fault they were lost. No way their restoring things a hacker stole.
---
Then bethesda gets closed down.... :(
---
Is this issue solely a PC issue or is this happening on console as well?
---
Your welcome something not quiet right with armour for some reason I was taking more damage in my PA then out of it, some of the perk cards were not working at all lol
---
That is the most depressingly pathetic thing I’ve ever heard. I truly feel bad for your kids. 
---
Enjoy the holiday!
---
Ah thank you. I haven't been paying enough attention.
---
'May have' ?
---
I agree, 100%. At this point, I say scrap Elder Scrolls 6, too, for good measure.
---
Same lol, looking for proof before even dipping a toe into this boiling pot.
---
At least you didn’t throw it away like I did and find out later.
---
Not on PC I hope?
---
I guess I'm just a skeptical person. Most people on 76 are genuine people but there are also quite a few griefing trolls.
---
Hackers run PC
---
Exactly
---
You should be scared. I'm positive the hackers are updating their code as we speak, and there are more of them then their are Bethesda programmers. We'll be right back where we started in a day or two.
---
Not nice to talk about Bethesda like that.
---
because we like it.
---
I'm going to be honest, and I'm a level 200+ player. This entire game has become a gigantic joke. 
---
It's almost like Bethesda wants to put Fallout into a grave, I know they don't... But they aren't doing a good job retaining players, no one I know gives a crap about Fallout First. I've never given them any extra money for Atomic Store stuff because those skins are waaayyyy overpriced.... 
---
If Wastelanders isn't good there is no reason for me to play. 
---
If Wastelanders is good I might buy $5 of Atoms and get a fridge or some other thing for the lolz.
---
You wont likely get a refund, Heck some say the hackers are already mad about refunds
---
It's practically the same repetitive game except except hackers and aimbots own the PvP mode.
---
&gt;how much does Russia suck
---
Good question. For the extremely rich? Not at all. For the poor? STRAP IN BUCKAROO
---
They feel bad for you as ignorant as you are.
---
A roll back would be hard to do. I believe Bethesda only makes periodic backups of our characters (once a week, once a month, something like that). Even if they did a rollback, you'd get some items back while losing others (levels you've earned, holiday rewards, etc). I'd imagine we will eventually get a partial rollback and partial compensation in some other form.
---
Yes man that sucks real hard. I hope they do something for you guys. I heard some dude found his guns in a hacker’s vending machine and had to buy it back. That’s such crap.
---
Not true. There are coming bigger hack in future 24/25, and its planned to delete pernamently characters made by players. There are a lot of videos about it
---
If I sold everything on reddit all you guys would see is post after post of my junk. I just stick the hot items on here.
---
But nobody thought this game was unsinkable
---
PC only, requires running a script.
---
Bethesda are just going to give us 500 Atoms as "Compensation" and not even bother with a roll back. I mean they have the nerve to say a "small number" of players were affected when one fucking hacker could rob 500+ players in a single day. Imagine all the people who also have the hack and decided to rob people as well.
---
If you guys were serious, you would actually do something about it and go the legal route so this kind of shit will never happen again on this scale and turn any would be hacker away, and also rollback the server a day or two before the hack so the people that spent hundreds of hours won't lose their hard earned gear.
---
I do get sick of things sitting in  my vendor though.
---
And resets your level
---
Bethesda's anti-cheat measures are the digital equivalent of a Mercedes left unattended with the engine running in front of a 7/11.
---
But these controversies only affect you if you play the game, I’m assuming since you dislike fallout 76 that you don’t play it. So the question is why do you get so upset about controversies surrounding a game that you do not wish to play anyway?
---
For the record I’ve never been majorly inconvenienced by any of these controversies, I know some people have but as someone who hasn’t experienced many problems, a lot of what I read or watch on YouTube seems to be blown massively out of proportion.
---
Makes sense I didn’t account for that. I do have some random junk in my vendor. Currently looking for a new home. Seneca rocks was great but I never got slot of traffic up there.
---
Unfortunately I am calling this the death of the game on the PC end
---
Canvas bag
---
New secret quest at grafton pawn
---
I’m glad you said you don’t expect it, cuz Bethesda don’t give two shits to be honest.
---
The max players on any one instance IS around 10. Do correct me if I’m wrong though.
---
If that was the case they are only making bad publicity to there game. I doubt the are that naive.
---
Thank you!
---
I started a new character, my main is around 250 and I never did another play through. Picking up on a lot of lore that I missed a while ago as I rushed it. It's a good distraction before having to go visit family tomorrow for Christmas.
---
I figured that but I thought I ask to clarify. Thank you
---
Last 6 months, nothing, unless you are willing to pay 100$ for a subscription to get scrapbox for unlimited storage.
---
I won't attack someone under level 50 at all. Unless they won't leave me alone. Then they're probably trying to start something so that their higher level griefing friends can "ambush" me. Instead, I just kill them all until they run out of caps. If they need to resort to toxic griefing methods to have a chance against me, they've already lost.
---
Bout 4:10 eastern for 20 minutes
---
You’re scared I can tell.
---
In three words: you shouldn't.
---
Im sorry, did you not see that big giant warning you get in the center of your screen that tells you if you take the workshop you are inviting PVP.
---
Its like literally half the screen.
---
If you take a workshop, you invite PVP.  And anyone above level 50 is on equal standing for character power.  A lvl 50 has the same abilities in PVP as a lvl 500.
---
If you take and hold a workshop, some PVP guy will come take it from you.  If you are there when it happens, s/he will kill you, take your junk, then continue to take the workshop.
---
It is not our fault you chose to ignore the warning the game threw up for you, that told you what will happen if you take the workshop.
---
Yeah, I get that not everyone is into Star Wars.
---
You mean beyond the statement where they acknowledged the issue, committed to investigating the issue, and then issued a hotfix to fix the issue. I could have sworn the responded.
---
The wacky thing is you know who doesn't appear to be reading Fallout 76 cheat forums?
---
Bethesda.
---
but workshops ARE for pvp. telling people to only fight pvp people... that's who workshops are meant for so if someone has claimed one it is assumed - and fairly so - they want to pvp. it does what it says on the tin.
---
OK ty Sr. Hmmm wait this one out lol no offense or anything.
---
Lol props for honesty I over exaggerated
---
If its not 100$ i am not buying.
---
I play on Xbox. The only thing that scares me is your grammar.
---
Bad theory. The guy who made the hack doesn't work for Bethesda or allied with them in anyway. And people who did this was to despite us the players.
---
just wonder, by "few" players mean bethesda hundreds or thousands, or few dozen thousands players ??
---
That's nowhere near small considering the number of players actually still playing.
---
Oh? Can you post some of those videos here?
---
Acknowledging that there is a problem solves nothing, they know about the state of 76 but are careless and dgaf
---
It’s right up there with the people that sell 5.56 ammo in there vendor for 3caps.
---
I was under the impression that the people who made this hack essentially provided how to fix it perminantly too, and that the fix was very simple.
---
Most people are, your right. But some people aren’t as well, your also right. Most people I encounter are really generous and kind, but some are mean and like to greif people and take advantage of their trust.
---
I have multiple games that are cheaper and have way better anticheat. This can't be an issue at this point. I feel like I'm buying something that's not finished.
---
7.7b people on the planet, large margine are expected to make a jump. A few thousand is a small number especially if a game has a worldwide audience. How many people are getting on the game the very moment people are getting off? How many people are new and what is the margine of those replace who left the game? It's not unrealistic.  Games don't have "Static" numbers, as much as you want this game to always have 5million players, that's not how it works. 
---
The same applies to any other game. Hell look at Steam Charts for various games, especially MMOs and look at the rise and fall in numbers. It's never "Static" at all. Cause people have this thing call a "Life". Some people log off to go to work on one side of the planet while others are getting off work and logging into their favorite games on the other side of the planet. NTM in local TZs some people work normal shifts, others have varied shifts, some have unorthodox type shifts/workflows/ect. Some people can play games during their breaktimes or for some rare jobs can play while they work. 
---
Welcome to reality, it hurts huh?
---
So this exploit is only PC? Even so, what happens when a player is hacked and loses an item they may have paid real money for? Is Bethesda able to roll back that players character and/ or replace the items? Is the console versions currently at risk?
---
500 was from ONE player, nobody knows, how much few others were doing that too, especially not bethesda
---
Well, those who are affected by the exploit will receive 500 atoms which surely makes up for everything.
---
EXACTLY!
---
\*Insert hysterical laughter here\*
---
It’s a response....you say they didn’t respond.... the fixed the issue
---
&gt; Hi everyone,
---
&gt; We are investigating reports of a PC-only exploit that *is being* abused by cheaters, which *has* resulted in a few players losing items that their characters had equipped *or in inventory*. *Even though we were aware this was possible last year* we have only been actively working toward a solution for *this recently and might* have a fix that we are currently evaluating for release today.
---
&gt; While we’ve determined that a *large* number of characters have been negatively affected, we are *finally taking* this very seriously and resolving this, *after a year of knowing about its possibility*, is currently our top priority.
---
&gt; We would like to apologize to those of you who were impacted by this exploit, *that we’ve known was possible for some time, who have had your hard earned gear and potentially atom purchased items stolen.* We want to make this right, and we are currently looking into ways we *will absolutely* compensate you. If you believe you have been affected, please let us know by submitting a ticket to our Customer Support team.
---
&gt; As mentioned above, this issue only affects PC, and we are currently planning to bring the PC version of the game offline today to release a fix. We will let you know as soon as we are ready to begin maintenance.
---
&gt; Thank you very much.
---
FTFY
---
Untrue.
---
Hackers and aimbots own PC. 
---
They dont exist on console.
---
Oof right in the Fallout 76 map guy.
---
The classic bait and switch, yep that’s fun. Not for them but for us. Who’ve been playing more then a couple months and have seen it before. I think the level 50 cap is fair because anything under that is still like a newborn to me. I really think Bethesda should do something about PvP and stop just trying to cash in on fallout 1st. And by that I mean them not doing anything about the toxic parts of the game is almost a marketing move for them. It just bothers me. And I’m frustrated about that guy because I’m just trying to help lower levels and live my life in Appalachia but nope. 
---
Stupid raiders lol
---
I know the website where the hacks started from. There is no future threat. You are fear mongering. The guy who made the script, tested it and you can't steal items anymore.
---
Okay well NOW they are sociopaths!!
---
I’ve been trying to find that video but I can’t. The closest video I’ve found is the one linked in the comments here and it doesn’t show even close to 100. Do you happen to have a link or know where I can find the video?
---
2x *** knives, 4x *** explosive guns, full set of *** unyielding armor, X01 PA, Pipboy. How they going to compensate for that lot???
---
Yup they could call it the "Fallout Fix" subscription.
---
Kay
---
No. Even my "Bethesda will slow-walk a patch to boost Fallout 1st subs" statements look sane compared to this. 
---
Also, was that a Game Theory reference?
---
Keep in mind that the people who attack lower level players are generally trash at PvP to begin with. They aren't going to fight other PvP players. That requires skill and competence.
---
If you see a bully, and you have the ability to fight back, do so. Bullies lose interest once they get punched in the nose. Keep doing it until they find somewhere else to build up their empty egos.
---
I hold my breath for when they release starfield and TES VI, how they are gonna fuck those games up.
---
Just buy fallout 1st, i can play and not deal with the exploit. Shame if you can’t afford it
---
Also possible. 
---
Bethesda's competition has capable workers who hack, abuse, and torment players to help their own bottom line. They also give early access to their games and free gear to youtubers like a bribe to devalue and shit on this game while promoting others &lt;cough cough The Outer worlds cough&gt;
---
OR STILL .. Modders cut out of the profits, page hits, and likes they regularly get with Fallout games are retaliating. They already know the system and xmas they are hurting for money so they lash out. 
---
OR EVEN... Some company is attempting to sell Beth anti cheat software, fixes whilst wreaking havoc on the game.
---
Either way this is about money.
---
That’s the problem. It happened, in all those places simultaneously. But all those places are not entitled to the parts of information from a different part. A good lawyer could tie this up for years just arguing “who has jurisdiction for what information”. Good luck.... it’s a never ending quagmire
---
The Devs took down the servers to apply a patch for a nasty hack that came out yesterday, a hack where one could steal all the items in anothers inventory. So if the servers look up but you can connect it cause they are in dev mode, aka devs only, while they test the fix.
---
Yes it was ;)
---
Miller, hes not interested in facts, just wants to get on the wagon with the rest of the haters.
---
They just rolled out the hotfix.
---
Since they are single player their is less to screw up
---
Sorry. I meant depends where the victim is.
---
xD
---
is it fixed?
---
It looks nice, esp. the high ceilings
---
The problem lies with the game itself. Bethesda is never going to be able to fix this ancient game engine. The best they will be able to do is account ban cheaters and implement a robust comercial anti cheat solution. Knowing them however they will colossally fuck up both to an infuriating and comical degree.
---
Many "live services" are designed to require a constant internet connection because it's much easier to monetize and also limits piracy more effectively than classic DRM (since the account data is stored on publisher-controlled servers).
---
Additionally, making a game needlessly dependant on a connection allows to shut down that game and nudge players into buying the next edition (have all their microtransaction purchases invalidated so they have to rebuy everything again, like in sports games like FIFA and PES). Bethesda lamented before that they saw Skyrim's popularity akin to a lost opportunity to keep the experience monetized over time.
---
Receive compensation for only $9.99
---
And you own it.
---
Haha too poor for that! Adventure mode is where you could be hit. Although private servers are the recommended way to play until it is all sorted out. Stay safe
---
We all heard about this like a week ago and they waited until it literally fucking exploded.  "As soon as possible" c'mon man.
---
That's because every time I try to fast travel up there I fall a million miles to the ground.  Lol. I've found that my favorite camp builds are scenic and peaceful but that comes at the cost of low traffic. My current camp is way south right on the border of cranberry bog and savage divide and it's kind of hit and miss with the traffic. Im considering moving but it's my favorite so far. A small stream runs beneath my camp and it took me hours to get that build to work.
---
&gt;DOX 
---
can you tell me, how do you want dox someone, who are 200m far, so you dont see him basically, or he is behind wall or door, or he dont be even in the same location like you, he can be literally behind mountain, and he still can steal all your items
---
:,(
---
Bethesda isn't listening. They don't care about your opinions. They just want your money.
---
lol few players.....
---
Lmao
---
The PR hit would be too damaging.
---
I dared not to login yesterday, while I shall find a legendary TSE if I did. Who can compensate me?
---
It’s kind of bullying bud especially when their under level 50. And yes I’m sure they saw the message but I’m also almost 100% sure they don’t know how deadly a bloodied stealth boy build is. So maybe if instead of just a “hey you’ll be available to PvP, 100% freely and often times without warning, here’s your only reminder. “
---
It said something along the lines of “hey this guy who been playing this game since beta and knows the best way to totally mess up you’re game night is lurking watching the map, waiting for someone like you to take this place so he can ruin you are you sure you want to do this it’s gunna cost you X amount of caps now and maybe all of them by the time it’s said and done?” 
---
Then you click yes and it asks again but in a different way
---
Then when you get the pop up message while you’re off doing whatever mission you got an option of whether you wanted to just forfeit it with no harm really done or fight for it. 
---
But no it doesn’t do that... be nice if it did so when I do decide to fight it the buttheads not camping the FT point waiting.
---
I'm sorry but where do you get the idea these hacks are so "full of hate and anger" lmao do you have a source for that? 
---
Also sorry but Bethesda isn't a victim whatsoever. That's like saying a storage company is a victim when they leave all the storage units unlocked for years even after people tell them they're unlocked and vulnerable. 
---
Bethesda has been paid and is continuing to be paid by a lot of people for a secure entertaining product. It's their responsibility to ensure FO76 is secure and running stability. This they haven't done even when warned. Therefore the majority of the fault lies with them. If there was no way to hack the game this badly there wouldn't be hackers hacking it. That simple. 
---
Truth hurts 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
For real, this is clown college level PR every time they write.
---
Fixed.
---
'...which may have resulted in a few players.' Seriously? What kind of damage control is that?
---
Haaaa I got a good chuckle out of this one. But yes it is right up there
---
Fortunately I'm now a 193 and I'm not terribly worried about most people.
---
Do you guys really think anyone is dropping their holiday vacation to come fix this? Lolol. If it’s anyone it’s the interns or entry lvl code engineers. The “B” team if you will. Maybe we should just put the down for a bit and take a break. Drink a bit more molly laced eggnog and chill
---
this is comedy
---
You should really try ESO again it's come a LONG WAYS from it's old beta days and is a fantastic Elder Scrolls game these days.
---
True though haha
---
Haha, this is the perfect analogy. ;) ive.... ive seen some things, man.
---
that's not true at all people who lost their whole inventories when vault 94 bugged out got their stuff back
---
HoHOOOOOOOO BUDDY did you pick one hell of a day
---
Only what I had equipped. Another comment suggested that they where targeting specific loot?
---
&gt;  since technically hackers were the first ones to introduce human npcs into the game.
---
How did that one even happen?
---
Grievers can pickpocket your inventory from kilometers away.
---
So you're saying FO76 isn't running on a slapped together mix of the Creation Engine and Multiplayer code from Quake then? Bethesda lied about that?
---
I can't remember what came in when, but if you don't know what a Sheepsquatch is, then there's some new content you'll like.  Also if you like to play in teams there's new vault raids, which some people do love (and the rest of us tried when they came out but largely ignore now).  
---
If you had a favourite bug, don't worry it's probably still there :)
---
Don't fucking try to "PR" this shit with "only a few have been affected" bullshit. You guys have seen the video. I know you have. 500 people in 9 minutes? Theres no way it's "just a few". Fuck you guys.
---
No kidding, you have to be really twisted and sick to do something like this literally on Christmas; they planned it all on purpose too just to cause maximum damage. I hope they get karma somehow or another from the universe bringing back the pain they caused to others back upon themselves.
---
Which ones do you like ? It's totally possible. You can admit that much, eh? You are saying that this is ethically and morally under this company to do.. correct? If you can admit that much, that Beth could do this then you gotta ask would they do this. Would they be breaking any legally binding, fine inducing laws by manipulating people through social media in such a way? If not and if they could...thee single thing holding any company back from doing such a thing would be .. some kinda moral standard they hold themselves to? 
---
My theories are better.
---
Just buy Fallout 1st subscribtion and play on a private world
---
I guess what I’m saying is it needs a better warning system and needs a better spawn point randomizer. And this whole post is about bullying the low levels. If you are one of those people that’ll kick the lower levels out of workshop just because you can maybe you should remember what it felt like to be bullied yourself in real life because you dunno who’s on the other side of that character.
---
Technically if they were stealing atom-shop items, it could be brought to court and charged for computer fraud? It is theft of monetary items at that point. Either manner, I suspect most people doing this are going to be using VPN's or proxies of some sort. Actually finding them would be pretty impossible at such point. The most they could do would continue to ban accounts involved. If a cheater/exploiter has to buy a new copy of the game every 2 days that becomes really.. Not cost effective very quickly.
---
Calm down Jimmy, I doubt they will screw over the people effected that bad. Of course it's all speculation at this point.
---
Nope, though if someone starts a rumor, you can bet the normal YT naysayers will pick it up.
---
I'll catch up on YT later, so if there's something more there I haven't heard about it yet.
---
PC masts race.....oh wait a minute?
---
The money goes to a private company not the government
---
PC only.  Probably wasn't him (though pretty sure he started it).  I haven't heard of anything going on since the patch.
---
I would say make a  throw away character. I know..I know that sounds super shitty. If you gotta get that FO76 fix this is your safest bet. At least if you lose something it will be more of a "meh" feeling than a "Oh shit, i just lost 1k worth of hours". I would not be surprised if they just delete your items after they yank them.  I really wanna play too since i just started and i am only lvl 22 but like hell am i losing my stash of mats and modded out fire ax. Plus if they can do that who says they wont tear down my base which i spent time making.
---
Like they made it sound like they would, before release, which was a crucial point as to whether I would get involved with this game or not? Yeah, then fo76 would probably have been one of the most popular games on the market by now.
---
Those people are cheating more than a FO1st subscription 😂
---
Source Code didn’t come out until lastnight. But you seem to be on top of things.
---
You gotta hand it to Bethesda though.  Nobody is talking about the fact that every NW game is basically unplayable between the massive hacks and exploits plaguing every match.  
---
PR win!
---
Would. You. Like. To. Play. A. Game?
---
I dunno, hackers seem to be more trustworthy at their word than Bethetic.
---
\*in Stan Smith's voice\*
---
I'm telling the President!
---
University staff had reverence for Bethesda?
---
Can't. For some completely unsolvable reason that Bethesda has given up trying to fix, I can't complete any purchases through  Digital River, the third party client that handles F76 in-game purchases
---
Yeah I feel you they used to be probably my all time favourite developer it's really sad to see how far they've fallen knowing we'll probably never see another Morrowind or Fallout 3 or anything from them. 
---
At least we now have Obsidian Games though!
---
Interesting idea, I'm no script/code expert. But perhaps when work benches are used your items are cached in a seperate storage area temporarily whilst you work on them? Again, that is a wild guess :)
---
100 atoms
---
Just turn off the game permenantly
---
They will give u back your items
---
Can you at least preorder Starbound or Elder Scrolls 6?
---
I haven't touched the game in months, uninstalled from hard drive and no plans to return. I find the way Bethesda has treated this game or their community despicable and deserving of every bit of criticism they have received.
---
Still I feel no ill will toward those finding enjoyment in the game, and wankstains like this guy or the enabling commentators on his video deserve a special rung in hell.
---
Any responsible IT manager is doing them multiple times daily. With all of the BDR options out there doing 15 minute incremental backups there's no excuse.
---
So Zenimax Online and Matt Frior and Wikipedia are all lying about it then? 
---
Seriously come on it takes 5 seconds to do a simple search jesus 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Dude, I have 2 boys and a wife as well. We own a LOT of games. If pokemon shield went face up and hackers could steal all my pokemon, I would just boot up another game. Or if we dont feel like it, watch some Netflix or go to the park.... does your family literally revolve around FO:76?? I get that your family plays together and enjoys it, but you should do more than just that...
---
1/3 of the player base just casually hopping on and off over and over again LUL
---
They make backups every 6 months, so they can roll you back to July.  Good luck!
---
Kidding of course, but in the past the backups were pretty old, like weeks or so.  If they can figure out a better way than that, give them some times to do it.
---
Not I but a good chunk of the community sadly yeah.
---
they literally knew about the hack like a week ago or so, they were even provided (kinda) solution by the guy who invented it, yet what did they do? nothing. waited with their fingers crossed until shit hit the fan and then patched it.
---
I keep 1* on Luck of Draw and I use Explosive and FFR handmades and it procs quite a lot, which is especially useful for SBQ so you don't have to stop in middle to repair. My main FFR handmade I haven't had to repair in weeks... Seems to proc less on my TS Auto grenade launchers tho..
---
I haven't tried. Mostly because I'm not really interested in either of those games and I have limited funds for games.
---
Wouldn't even pay for a paint job 😞
---
Why do you exist just to cause others misery?
---
Thank you that’s basically what I’m saying. I’m a high enough level people must think I’m good at the PvP side but hell no that’s a totally different beast. If you want me to one shot a scorch beast or take on all the supermutants in the big fine, but one A-hole with a bloodied stealth boy explosive fixer and I’m toast. 
---
Worst part was I messaged atriums for some help and no one came to help these poor guys. 
---
Like dude you’ve already got over half the maps workshops go outside irl, or idk workout. Let other people learn to love the game, as much as you hate yourself.
---
Well Bethesda has to make the next ESO real good....or the studio will close. Let's see if they make it.
---
But we need to support the game. Paying for devs cost money
---
Oh yeah. Did you know Tramp is actually a KGB spy?
---
I don't know about that. I think they are after the company and have been since it came out. Maybe not this one individual but a group that influenced him or gave him something for his time. We can't know if this dude didn't get paid off by a different company to drive biz from Beth during the holidays. The questionable players I've come in contact with are always ripping on the company. The post in the sub are attacking the company.
---
Wrong tho. Rust as a way to hardware ban that is impossible go agaisnt.
---
Except it does though? There's a very good old thread here from over a year ago where modders and developers tried to warn Bethesda their game was vulnerable. FO76 is running on the creation engine with modified multiplayer code from quake tacked on. It's terribly put together which makes it easier to exploit. Plus most modders/hackers know more about the creation engine than your average Bethesda employee does.
---
What’s funny is they can just hire consultants or a company to make the game significantly more hacker free, but they simply don’t want to spend the money.
---
No.
---
They never say "sorry" but then again, at this point, if you play you know what shit you're stepping in to.
---
He means you can't even make it to your stash box before someone comes along and inventory-hack you.
---
I thought the expression "pick on someone your own size" was common knowledge. Any way you look at it, a lvl 200 blowing away a low lvl its bullying. That said, I dont use workshops because you are willingly opening yourself up for pvp.
---
There's zero chance of this succeeding with this engine.
---
Best Bethesda could do would be turning this game singleplayer during a transition or strictly coop with friends.
---
Wise move, though still risky. I'm sure it isn't a big leap until they can hit our stash. Stay safe!
---
truth :))))
---
You can claim whatever you want. Doesn't make shit true. 
---
I'm the King of England! If you look in my comment history, you'll see I've said that several times! Pfft gettottahere
---
Source?
---
I don't light shit on fire with my friends.
---
You should try getting friends. Then play with me.
---
It seems super random- it showed me 37k when I first opened it. 10 seconds later refreshed- 24k. Refreshed again- 31k. 
---
I’m kind of a numbers nerd so I was curious, ha!
---
From a scale of Priceless to 700,000 caps, how much do you feel these presents (Just the presents and not the outside stuff like stats and filming) were worth?
---
dont need that many.  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb) &lt;- this was my old role. I will be making a new IMGUR gallery with my new BOS role and include a guide. what I am running is acheivable at level 56 perk point wise. the PA is stock. the .50 cal is stock with only heavy weapon mod added. 
---
No mutations either . I cracked the heals thing with nuka cola. you can buy ou t the white spring soda fountain 5 times in a row with all of your alts. I really hate cooking so I went lead belly to be able to eat all non spoiling food in the game without picking up rads. 
---
the last silo run I went before coming to work went smooth as butter. I have the alts all positioned for restocking of nuka colas and for selling mutation serums. 
---
I would say the only advantage Level 380 gives me is an in depth knowledge of the silos and the game in general. and that my friend I am always willing to share.
---
yeah, I guess I should have payed attention to the level the guy was behind him
---
No, the ultimate blame belongs to the people who choose to do asshole things. Just cause it’s easy to get around the game’s restrictions preventing you from doing it does not mean it’s ok or that it is the company’s fault that you chose to do the asshole thing. The company is at fault for providing a game that is too easy to circumvent but they ultimately are not the ones choosing to do an asshole thing. 
---
Just cause you can do something does not make you any less at fault for doing it.
---
I’m about to jump online. PSN japavu.  No charge for Knight or Officer paint. For 300 caps I’ll do the Paladin paint. I unfortunately don’t have the Elder paint yet...
---
They didn't let Bethesda know about a vulnerability, they *published* it for maximum damage. They're not trying to help. This was a calculated attack designed to hurt the company as much as possible by hurting as many users as possible. The YouTube "reporter" with a sneak peek was complicit in the affair, all too eager to fire up the hate sleigh to spread the mischief far and wide, and they should be banned too.
---
They played whack a mole on duping exploits, cleaned up a ton of the worst bugs, introduced new fun content practically every week, gave birth to the seasonal event, introduced the the ITV newsletter, gave us the road ahead blog... the game may be in a cluster fuck crisis mode today, but wild Appalachia was the team firing on all cylinders.  If we don't recognize that then we're just a circle jerking bunch of cry babies
---
No. It’s just sad, son. 
---
Delighting in the misery of strangers is simply a defective and immature personality trait.
---
Thanks I will, would love to get something even semi modern for future Bethesda games 👍🏻
---
Mankind redefined. The goal was to replace everyone so that people were under control, so that they could rebuild civilization. Civilization, their way.
---
Nah, you got them good mate. Fair play.
---
The correct number is 1,000,000 give or take 999,468
---
Again, think about how many people there are on the planet, and then think about how many are gamers, and then think about how time never stops and how people have lives.
---
Sonder must be hard for you. If it was a fake site I bet you the number would be like 500-1000 and the number would NEVER change.
---
That or they have no fucking clue what’s going on and how to stop it so there’s no updates.
---
He made the script to test the exploit, then released it. Since he made it public, script kiddies that want to ruin the game for us, got all excited.
---
Don't know his history but I see the stuff online.
---
I'm just glad this has been fixed and can't steal items anymore.
---
👌😂👌
---
Yeah right only a small number.
---
yeah, they'll just be sending automated responses throughout the holidays.
---
and I can't pity someone incompetent to the point they can't pull off 5 minutes fixes in the CK.
---
Disagreed but hey to each their own 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
hopefully they got some good overtime
---
I didn’t say they were trying to help. I said they demonstrated the hack days ago. They even said exactly when they would release it. Bethesda knew last week. 
---
Security through obscurity is not valid security. That’s Rule #1 in the tech industry. The YTers That made a video talking about it did nothing wrong. The ones that are part of the group are different and are responsible.
---
All that said, Bethesda knew and did nothing.
---
Yeah it just sucks that that’s the reason not to play part of the game or help others with a safe spot to figure shit out. I always looked at workshops as potential settlements like in FO4 but I guess I’ll just have to look at them like downtown Baghdad, which is a shame.
---
yes it is on pc
---
I’m about to get on I’ll use the  knight paint thanks
---
Due to dev rooms?
---
Lmao you're all gonna keep eating bethesdas shit because you are pigs in a pen.
---
What platform were you on?
---
A few players? It's over 500 players last I checked...
---
FO76 hates packet loss.  You say you checked your internet - internet being up isn't good enough.  Run a cable to the router as diagnostic step 1 to eliminate wifi dropouts.
---
Remember to preorder Elder Scrolls 6!
---
Ironic that you would leave the game and lose all you worked hard for... out of fear of losing all you worked hard for. I guess there is some hope with this way at least. Now I may not like the game but I do actually feel sorry for you guys, just because I wasn't having fun dosn't mean you guys aren't. Hope shit gets fixed for all you lot. Whatever anyones opinions are, you have to see these hacks as people just trying to spoil the fun for others. P.S. Before anyone asks why I am here, a non-player who refunded the game; I saw the news and wanted to see how extensive it really was. Looking at the posts it's bad, real bad. Again I'm not here for any negative reason, just to say; damn sorry guys. 
---
Bethesda needs a stern kick in the ass, maybe you guys could all get together to send a letter to them with thousands + people's names (usernames) attached to it? I dunno, even an online petition or something and link it to Bethesda. Anything really.
---
I had a beautiful rooftop bar and amazing scenic views but it was lonely lol. Then I moved to the mire waterfall but wasn’t happy there. Looking for a new scenic spot not to far off the beaten path.
---
Working in IT, I full know the headache they deal with.
---
I don’t like subscribing to and paying for CRA 1st, but I mean I do get health care services, police services, fire services, roads and highways, sewers and other infrastructure, and military services.
---
Then again I guess for someone who can't think like that isn't old enough to even have a job or comprehend that people have them around the entire planet.  People play their games when they can, log on or off, go to work come back, wake up and game or wake up and work, etc, etc, etc... It's NOT a huge complex thing to comprehend. 20k-40k people around this time jumping around isn't a big deal at all. Add in the fact there's MILLIONS of other games, and people like me who play one game for a few minutes then jump to the next game do exist as well, although probably a minority.  There's thousands of other varibles to consider as well.
---
1. The Gambryo engine originally was designed for MMO's. 
---
2. All they did was take multiplayer code from Quake and brute force it into the creation engine. This is a big part of why FO76 is so unstable and easily exploited. 
---
3. Yeah using a better engine for a multiplayer game would have been easier and made a much better game. 
---
They also didn't want to spend the money for that.
---
I'm directly connected to the router on my PC.
---
Nice try Mr. Wanna be hacker.
---
In game exploits are ok to a certain degree, but when you actively go out of your way to take someone's gear that took them endless hours to gather is a whole nother level of scumminess and grief. Condolences to all who have lost irreplaceable items and gear due to the grinches on PC. Level 570 with 2500 hours in a 10 mules filled to the brim with gear on PS4, if I could throw you some gear I most certainly would.
---
I can't argue with that, I hope they are compensated well for taking the time during holidays.
---
This one time when survival mode was still a thing, I was playing on my low level character on my xbox, these level 100 and up players invited me to their team, me being the naive player I was at the time, fast traveled to them only to be met by them kicking me off the team and shooting me dead.
---
 No.
---
PC. Directly connected to my router.
---
Its a Mrs, and i just got robbed today, thanks :) Im just curious. My friends said i should remove all the atomic shop paint from all of my weapons, and take off everything what i have from there, so it wont happen again, but im not sure about it, thats why im asking.
---
I’m not sure deleting someone’s character is even possible without having access to their actual Bethesda account , as I said , they’re probably talking out their ass to seem clever after the inventory stealing was patched quicker than they expected..
---
Fuck charges, it’d be more efficient if someone could actually get ahold of him.. 
---
Not that I’m endorsing, encouraging, or promoting anything like that.
---
I wouldn't even think it would be fun for the bully because it's no challenge.  The  most fun pvp battles are the ones that could go either way.  Workshops are still usable because almost everyone knows at least one person with FO1st.
---
it just treated players as containers that could be looted freely. players *are* containers after all.
---
Hey there ! Thanks for taking the time to reply :)) 
---
I'm using rank 2 bandolier solely for my railway rifle, so, if I find a bloodied lever action or better, I'll switch that out.  I've switched 1 point from endurance to luck, replacing ironclad with good doggy and adding serendipity to Luck, now at 11.
---
Thanks for the detailed response man :)
---
Cant kick them while they're up
---
What’s UC?
---
Yeee haven't seen it, apparently doesn't show the dude.systematically.hacking 500.people all in one.go.
---
I can confirmed and no I'm not going to get into it but the exploit is occurring on ps4

whoot before work I had a smooth as silk silo run and queen kill. this vanilla build performs super nice. Since I got rid of all mutations the heal solution was pesky. with nuka colas and the nuka cola perk though I can provide myself an ample supply of heals and rad removal at the white spring by buying all her stock with all 5 characters. 
---
next up I need to get some water purifiers up and running I ran out of steel. 
---
My Camp is now sitting on an acid node but I crafted it in small sections so I can easily move it if it doesnt work out. 
---
I have been running fusion cores for ages I was not expecting to have a steel problem by switching to .50 still have to explore that avenue further. I seem to be keeping up but I havent done any hardcore grinding.
---
That's a pretty low bar.
---
few days ago I couldn't agree you more... 
---
but now... look where we are... we'll never be save again... I'm okay with cheaters flying around or aim botting me... but when someone could take my hard grinded stuff (and the next exploit could be just around the corner) I'm done... until they rework their mechanisms to prevent exploits like this.
---
There is an pretty active community around the hackers... it's public... anyone can read the threads and track their progress. But BS don't freakin cares!
---
That would not have been useful in combatting this particular hack.
---
Maybe we start cutting internet abusers off the internet? Or challenge the courts to come up with laws that fit our tech times. You harass me on the street, I can call the cops.. I can sue you.. I can smack you. People do it online cause there is no punishment, no retaliation. There should be consequences for criminals online.
---
It's neither. And hack was fixed, data mining group verified it.
---
FUD
---
Most people won't or often can't answer their phones on vacation
---
theres a resource deposit to the east of Graninger farm where you can farm water and junk or junk and lead.
---
Thats the release date. 76 started when they were exploring what it would take to create a co-op mode for fallout 4
---
And a Ukrainian asset. At the same time. Somehow.
---
I was planning to do a raider build soon myself, but it seems like it would be fairly hard if you're not starting in a pre-existing location with raider style assets. There just aren't that many raider items available right now.
---
Lvl-Thief has some good suggestions for decor though, and I'll throw in two locations I scouted recently: 
---
One is in the far north of Savage Divide (NW of Baily Family Cabins), and is basically a large wood walkway structure built on a slope with some raider decor and dead bodies lying around. Lots of potential there, but it may be hard to build new structures due to the walkway's design.
---
The second is in the middle-ish area of Savage Divide, right beside Monongah Mine (like really close, SW corner of its icon on the map). There's a fortification, a ramshackle cabin, and some raider stuff with a rusted out car. This one would probably be ideal if you want to build a new home on the site.
---
Its technically in the game, just not obtainable by legitimate means.
---
No, they've never been any good. No legendary weapons or armor. What's the point in them?
---
Lol, my bar is below the main floor right above the stream. A completely unobstructed view of cranberry bog and a calming sound. Nuke mushroom cloud looks cool from there. I'm glad to hear your opinion of the mire waterfall because I was considering it.
---
Simple: move to console.
---
I think they have a chance to drop certain plans, not sure which ones though.
---
Happy Christmas
---
They are a good source of junk, plans and scrapable weapons and armor. If you have a group they are a decent way to farm junk and learn mods for new characters. They also drop caps, stimpaks and other random stuff.
---
I think I have a new chapter for my book about Fanboys and their delusional behavior and tactics to defend companies/brands/products. Guess my research isn’t done yet. It’s in fact the only reason I came to this subreddit because I was hoping to get material for the book.
---
Bethesda developed a product.
---
Hacking it and altering it against the developer's will is a crime.
---
Just because you seem angry towards Bethesda doesn't change the fact that hacking is against the law.  The internet may be largely un-policed, and joy riding it seems popular with a certain sub-culture of humanity that sees themselves as somehow social outlaws (classic sociopathy).
---
Bethesda has no real obligation toward policing the internet beyond its desire to serve its customers (and keep making money).
---
Bethesda has broken no laws.  The "hackers" that hack their product and distort it have broken numerous laws, regardless if they or you see them as criminals or justice fighters, they are in the wrong.
---
I don’t. But I actually fired it up today and had to update it, and lo’ and behold it was still a buggy pos with massive frame rate drops.
---
PA pieces. at least that's people usually want them for.
---
no I didnt. I agreed that beth has issues but I still blame the hackers more. in summary "dear god beth please fix your shit and you hacking mofos suck"
---
Tell me where I made the grammar mistake.
---
Yup, absolutely no acknowledgement of the FO 1st shitstorm when it dropped.
---
I for one dont blame the hackers one bit. 
---
This falls squarely on Bethesda's feet. 
---
This will get fix and a week later a new hack will be introduced
---
Just wanted to say merry Christmas to this wonderful community there have been lots of bumps on the road but i have to say the past year has been a blast and it wouldn't be possible without this community!
---
Turning a blind eye to something like this puts you at a disadvantage. Why would you not want to know more details.
---
Hopefully not or nothing will ever change.
---
Happy Christmas :)
---
Patched today if I'm correct. They did seem to jump into a patch almost as soon as it was found out about. Which is good.
---
Merry Christmas
---
That doesn’t make sense, you can literally see it in my comment history, did you go to a special needs school by any chance?
---
Ah okay, I’ll have to start getting those. I’ve gotten a few plans from the gifts for pa pieces.
---
Lol just made the exact same comment :)
---
Uh oh, that's great, at least you know it's not wifi.  Things get much harder from here.  When I was having disconnects that frequently I ended up using a network health tool and finding I was getting back packet loss on the line - ended up being something my ISP acknowledged and (eventually a week later) fixed.  Netflix was fine; FO76 wouldn't stay connected for more than 10 mins.
---
I think their letting this happen so they can get more money from FO1st
---
Merry Christmas my man
---
After "scared."
---
Desert eagle, Mauser C96, m1911, MAC-10, BAR, Grease gun, tesla Canon,  junk jet, pipe revovler shotgun as well as other pipe shotguns and a pipe revovler grenade launcher
---
Plus a dual wielding perk card for pistols and one handed melee.
---
You should try on top of the mountain above cliffwatch where the lead resource is. Scenic and close to whitespring.  I had tons of business there
---
This is a video game lmao cool your jets 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
For a look at the degree of difficulty in preventing such a hack, might I recommend looking at Beasts of Bermuda for an example?
---
It's an indie game, with only two coders who both only work part-time and are both making their first game ever after starting ~2017. Most hacks worked in that game (e.g speed hacks, bite speed hacks, telling the server they were gigantic for a few seconds so they could put as many points into their skills as they liked) because a client could tell the server he was doing something and the server wouldn't judge them.
---
While it was tedious and did delay the development, it took only about 3 weeks for these two part-time guys to make their first anti-cheat patch (minus how long after the previous update it took for hackers to proliferate) for them to have basically every instance of hacking permanently removed, via having the server double-check the clients to see if they were telling it bullshit. It took an extra 4 days for them to patch out the last few, and I believe there was one last speedhack that was made impossible recently.
---
While not directly comparable- different engines, different player counts, etcetera- it may nevertheless be useful for contextualising the sort of problem that this was, how ubiquitous this type of hack is, and the degree of difficulty an experienced development team might have in preventing it.
---
This I legitimately expect mostly nothing to come of this except for reading about a fix in patch notes and that will sadly be the end of it.
---
So, it may have been related to the extremely critical server maintenance that happened today. 
---
Check the sub. Lots of issues for PC players, including total loss of inventory. 
---
All things considered, if server DCs were the worst that happened to you today, that’s a silver lining.
---
They can build things at your camp and take your water or material but besides that nah
---
Not quite. Same data mining group reported the method AND the fix about a week ago. Public hack was live for about 12-14 hours though.
---
Dude, learn to take a joke, it’s just a game, the only defective one here is the one with nearly 10k karma, seriously how sad does one become 😂
---
How do I submit a ticket when I did not even see the player who stole my gear? One minute I am accessing the Stash box at a train station with gear on, next moment I see gear disappearing in my inventory and I am naked. No one near me?
---
Oh, that was play with "em' ", not "me".
---
Boy, do I have egg on my face.
---
You're very welcome.  I use a Bloodied Railway Rifle too, but keep it for special occassions as I have it Primed out.  
---
One more tip- If you use VATS, I would highly advise though trying to find reduced weight or reduced VATS cost weapons, because the BTS mechanics of VATS is that it's based on weapon weight for its VATS cost and accuracy.  This is why I use a Pipe Rifle as my main go-to.  My fully tricked out Bolt Pipe and Bolt Revolver rifles weigh 7.5 and 7.2 pounds respectively, that's with everything for max accuracy, suppressed and Long Recon scoped.  Compare that with Handmades and Lever Actions with comparable mods, and they're over 18+ pounds.
---
Take down the pc server and as compensation give us a month a fallout first? 
---
Thats like having a criminal break into your home, take a dump on your floor and you demand the criminal clean up the dump and give you a month free of shits on your floor
---
Yeah, at least let us look good after being r@&amp;%ed
---
Of course - pvp exploits etc.
---
You really expect Bethesda employees to drop what they are doing with their families on Christmas vacation to fix a problem with inventories on an online character in a game that is dying and no one plays, and that most of Bethesda has given up on. That really would be a christmas miracle.
---
yes
---
they can drag you into PvP
---
its an old trick but it checks out
---
I really hope this isn’t a call for reimbursement on that leather armor....and marine wetsuit because that’s just pathetic if so. Sorry to be blunt but that’s like returning something and asking for money back when it was less than a dollar to begin with
---
Maybe they gilded themselves.
---
I’ll check it out! There was a cool spot down in the bottom left of cranberry bog I visited once that was overlooking a lake. It had great views of nukes and queens. I may end up there. As for the waterfall it was nice but I hate how dark the mire gets.
---
Carry a X-bow. Silent at short range, and you won't have an arrow over your head when you fire it.
---
Stealth weapon if you don't use a melee
---
If they have another person on their team they can kick that person then initiate PVP with them(and you since you're now a teammate) and kill you and loot you
---
Praise the lord then cause they did exactly that.
---
Pa and weapon plans plus some mods
---
Diablo 1 had also anti-cheat cheats, let the hacker wars begin.
---
Looks like my place.
---
Lmao 42k karma get a life bro, grow up, you sound like a little bitch saying that
---
I was talking about resposiveness to it becoming live in this situation. 
---
Am kinda curious if pc is still likely to get a rollback or not. Or what they are going to do for compensation.
---
Trust me. Fanboys really do get this delusional. Been working on a book about fanboys of companys, brands, and products. And these people are out of their fucking minds the things they say and do to protect a company that fucks them and only cares for their money.
---
Who's Bethesda's competition? Fallout 76 has been shat on since it came out. What company is going to feel threatened by it?
---
Be cautious. If you are on a team and your teammate triggers PvP against someone, that someone can freely attack his entire team. Including you. 
---
However, often it just someone wanting to be able to share/use team perks or Ft to other areas of the map for free. 
---
Just keep an eye open. And stash you junk before accepting the invite. Just in case.
---
[\[citation needed\]](https://i.imgur.com/qMb0Eb5.png)
---
uh no, the creatures make the game a little bit more interesting. if you get killed by a dog, thats on you. ive even won rounds because of them.
---
I’d feel bad taking their shoes.
---
I'm all for an offline mode, even if it prevented my character from ever re-entering online again..
---
Yes, they can make you hostile to kill you by being non passive themselves and attacking a buddy. Its an old pvp lame trick. Just don't accept team invites of people you don't know.
---
My wife was shaking when she logged off. which sucks we have both been gaming for ages but 76 we were actually running as a pair. it was nice. she might be moving on to a dif game now and I wont be following her. nothing else on the market has any appeal for me. if she quits I am turning her account into a mule account.
---
Apparently affected players will be rolled back.
---
It can (rarely) be griefers as they can start PVP and as you are on the team it engages you as well whilst their mate takes you out. Most randoms are fine but it does happen unfortunately so a lot of people don't accept team invites unless with msg... Or stash your junk first if you're unsure.
---
This doesn’t seem right
---
I've had an end game set on my main for 140+ levels. Learning every plan in the game is my end goals.
---
Checked my packet loss, checked my up and download speeds, everything seems to be working fine on my end. Unless it's something intermittent and I just happened to be playing 76 when it happened.
---
Thats nice. Wasnt really sure if they were doing inventory rollbacks or just server wide.
---
The spot with the lake you're talking about is just below me. About as close as the game will let you build to another camp. My stream flows into that lake.
---
😂
---
Doing the Lord's work, educating people about the consequences of supporting Bethesda. 
---
It both sucks and is hilarious at the same time. Peak dev incompetence
---
Same. I prefer online anyway but I’d like the option to go offline when I can’t play normally
---
You’re right, not everyone will lose their inventory, but it doesn’t mean we should just ignore these hackers, and I’m sure you’d be singing a completely different song if you got your shit taken
---
No, more like blaming the guy who got robbed when he  left his front door open with a sign saying steal my stuff.
---
Attack the messengers. Fanboy tactic #1
---
Can they delete things at camp?  
---
Someone joined my team earlier and I think they fixed a hole in my wall that was bugged.
---
I'm just struggling to find more railway rifles at the moment, I only have one mod unlocked, that being the short recon scope; Which at least helps with VATS accuracy.
---
Also, what are your thoughts on changing out Evasive for Thru Hiker ? It'll help with my carry weight and at such low health, the damage resistance could be sacrificed. :) Have a nice day anyway and hope your inventory isn't swiped
---
They can loot your santatron?
---
PC master race tho, amiright?!?
---
I play on Xbox. Is there a way to technically use them or do you just go to the dig spot?
---
Jurisdiction. IF the player is in another country, there is nothing you can do to them legally. Most you can do is IP / hardware ban
---
That was just by one player... Imagine the actual amount happening right now. 
---
Has to be easily in the thousands so it's ridiculous for Bethesda to say a small amount.
---
You should totally read the comic story that was written for Fallout by the Penny Arcade guys, it's offical Fallout lore and is considered canon!   It's great!  The suit even appears as an easter egg in FO 3!!!
---
It's never going single player. It's just something that you're going to have to accept. It's just not that game.
---
acceptable huh
---
Exactly.
---
Im sure Bethesda's fix will end up doxing your personal information and you end up having scammers sell your home
---
Friggin housemates with torrents xD
---
I've been playing on PC and PS4 this week and recently disconnects have been actually rare, which is why I am surprised you're having problems.  I'd say that's one aspect they've improved on for sure.
---
LOL amen
---
I honestly don’t understand the point of this comment. You say that a small team with less resources fixed allllllll their games hacks in less time than it took for Bethesda to respond to the NW hackers, and then immediately after say that because of the level of ONE hack, that the full Dev team for FO76 will have a tougher time fixing it? Maybe I’m reading this wrong or something, but that does not make sense to me. 
---
Your also not taking into account that this is a AAA game, that was not completed at launch, does not have proper anti-cheat, and still, to this day, over a year later, has game breaking bugs and glitches that have been in the game since it’s launch. Not some side project indie game that had care and QA put into it. 
---
Again, I could just be interpreting you wrong, but who knows.
---
I m curious. How do u actually dupe the weapons? Cant find anything online
---
I'm sorry, you expect these chucklefucks to be a make to put together a functional anti-cheat?
---
You forgot to change few to a lot
---
100 caps is way too much. maybe like 10 a pop
---
Happy cakeday!
---
The definition of rushing is releasing before being ready. The game is still not ready and it is already dead.
---
Now they're gonna release the raider undies skin just for you
---
You don't have to be hyper intelligent to tell you're an idiot either. Just some internet troll. Who gets his jollys off acting like he's better than someone else on the internet.
---
 To be honest I've always been skeptical of playercount.com as it really can only track via open source api's such as steam's. Fallout 76 isn't even on steam yet. So where they get their information from is beyond me, because I know for sure Bethesda doesn't publish that information. Xbox doesn't publish it's counts up there either from what I understand. One of the more accurate ways I know normal people can judge player totals over time (not active players) is by reversing the math on PlayStation's achievements for example. Even that's pretty inaccurate and would only tell you general numbers of players who've started the game up on PSN for example. 
---
I would be pretty concerned if my game had numbers bouncing by 20k every few mins as well. That doesn't seem right to me at all. User activity is usually large steady troughs and peaks during pretty anticipatable intervals. Such as when school lets out on each coast for example. It certainly bounces, but I'd be surprised if there are even 20k players on f76 at this point.
---
ESO here I come!
---
One country CAN make an agreement - an extradition treaty - that says "hey if someone breaks such and such of your countries laws, we will temporarily extend jurisdiction for you". However this depends entirely on the laws of BOTH countries involved. For places like russia, good luck getting them to care about an american video game enough to extradite cheaters.
---
To address your second point, they already got rid of the smaller map almost as soon as it came out.
---
To address your point about "skill" and "stealth"... Hiding in a bush doesn't require skill. And if you're being detected by creatures in the game, you lack skill with stealth. You can literally be seen by the Scorchbeast and make it lose track of you if you understand how stealth in this game works.
---
The name of the game is Battle Royale, not Hide n Seek.
---
Nah this community has more than enough folks to engage in such activities
---
Just go to the dig spot and click the dirt mound. Best to have a few maps of the same spot at once.
---
Love how the stairs go up behind the fireplace.. I see that so often IRL but not much in game.
---
I hate PvP. I don't like metas, I don't like min-maxing. I'm a casual.
---
Nuclear Winter is the most fun I've ever had PvPing, and even today I had a great time with it.
---
They literally said in their post earlier today that they would be taking care of those affected by the hack. They took care of those affected by the vault raid bug when that was a issue as well.
---
This should be the top post right now
---
They cannot delete things at your camp.
---
However they can fix walls and stuff without being on a team. Generally, if you receive a random team invite from someone on the map that you have idea who it is, better of not accepting incase of griefers
---
The hack gives them a workaround into getting into private servers!
---
I've had 2 characters lose 3\* armor and weapons. What do I need to do?
---
you all are removing innocent comments" does this effect xbox" you know we can see this and abuse of moderation.
---
Pay 50 atomic points for a set that says
---
S.P.E.C.I.A.L or juicy in on the bum haha
---
There are only like 3 ip’s that Bethesda has that are deemed as must buys and fallout is one of them. Stop being dramatic lol
---
Once again the net code has nothing to do with the engine itself. There have been many posts about how game engines work and you seem to have ignored all of them.
---
Uh.. yeah. This is YouTube, and the guys a piece of shit. What makes you want to believe him? He’s posting to YouTube, he only shows 1/5 of what he said... wouldn’t he show the 500th person to be able to brag about it? That’s what the YouTube video is for them, right?
---
Everyones been looting my santatron
---
What about the vault boy pelvic thrust images?
---
The problem with this game (in reality it does not deserve the title game or even live service) is baded on a total failed concept. Bethesda pretends that it can fix this in time. The problem is far more deeper than you think or even imagine. 
---
Your game engine is not broken, it is outdated and not ment for multiplay. It is like, when you try to use a VW Bettle for heavy transport or transport of dangerous goods. It will not work, you maybe make a few miles, but the end comes, before you even expect it.
---
Your version of the game engine, is not prepared, secured and fit for multiplay online, which has been proven by the last exploits. It does not matter, if 1 or 100 players are victims of hackers, you put players, their assets, paid items, playtime, everything deliberately on risk. No you did no even care, about what could happen to players or their game.
---
Since the game startet, the game is and was in the news, always because of bugs, fails, technical issues and now you hit the top score, digital fraud. Bethesda is not able not only to prevent this. So the company should consider 2 essential things for the future.
---
1) Remove "Todd Howard" - he lied all the time, on every occasion, he tried to calm the public. The house is on fire already, there is noone he can calm down anymore. The fire department is not comming, because you are not calling them. 
---
2) Stop the game. shut down servers, either to take some serious time to fix this mess or stop the game totally.
---
I wonder, is Todd Howard still getting money for this? Wow, normally managers like him, are getting fired instantly, but it seems he has a contract, which makes it impossible to get rid of him.  
---
My advise for all the players. It is not worth playing this game. The first fraud of this company was the release, a not finished product, advertised as full product. Bugs over and over again, hackers and now fraud on a high level.  
---
If you still thing this will be last of this bad news for this game, you are even more stupid than the people of Bethesda, who only care about your money, not your experience, game, items whatever.  
---
If you still want to fund Bethesda's incompentence, just pay them directly onto their bank account. Or better, transfer all your money to them, FOR NOTHING.  
---
YES FOR NOTHING. BETHESDA FAILED TO SEE THEIR ERROR AND RISK THEY ARE TAKING. THE LEADERSHIP WAS BLIND AND ARROGANT, BECAUSE THEY SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THAT THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN TO THEM.  
---
AND IT HAPPENED.  
---
The only ones, who are hit by actions like this, are those who still pay them money.  
---
PS: i am glad, that i stopped playing this game 2 months after release. Bethesda Games are done. I do not know, how other countries treat this issue, but looks like, being ANTI CONSUMER - is the new american way.
---
"A few"
---
I am now BOS full tilt boogy, no mutations no legendaries, basic non upgraded PA, it was challenging to figure out how to do it but I can now solo the nuke launch smoothly and I have killed the queen 3 times. the healing issue was resolved by buying nukas at the whitespring for heals VS using stims or vampiric/heal factor.
---
At this point it doesn't matter anymore, hackers found ways to basically edit anything as if it was a singleplayer game already so no point in not letting the rest of the people play on their own (stable) servers and if they ever finally introduce some sort of better anti-cheat they can count their options to give everyone 'fair play' regardless of official public, official private or self-hosted server
---
I've joined a few so far and they've all been really nice.
---
Refresh it 5-10 times.  It fluctuates over 15000 in under a minute.  It's just a rng program.
---
Everyone saw that video and inflated it/believed the idiot hacking. He never shows 500 people, it’s a lie.
---
Dev room item
---
Well, 76 was built with just their on hand box of scraps, so the quote is on point.
---
If I don't carry any junk on me, can I lose anything?
---
Play a real game
---
No, they don’t. No one knows the actual numbers (accept Bethesda, and they certainly aren’t going to tell us) and anyone who thinks they do is talking out their ass.
---
I gave up. Went back to FO4.
---
Radios. I had some rando go to my CAMP and build fucking radios everywhere. Hid em so good. I still have one I can't find months later.
---
The majority are fine tbh, not trying to dissuade you from teaming up, just be aware of the team pvp rule and Stash your junk often and you should be fine!
---
Kinda, yeah.  This is when most people in large swaths of the world have their vacations.  And there is a limited time event going on.
---
But its not though, and never has been. The problem is Bethesda failing to update it. You can't blame an inanimate object for something when its the creators who have failed to properly modernize and alter it to their current needs. Look at fortnite, its using unreal engine, as are countless other games and that engine is 20+ years old, the difference is they've updated it to where they need it be, hence the fourth iteration known as unreal engine 4.
---
Ughh. I was simply pointing out that how a game looks is not exactly the most predictable benchmark of it being fun/good.
---
Imo useless and a waste of a slot
---
 I wouldn't take anything they say at face value.
---
Their only point was to make Bethesda look worse and people afraid to play the game; they have an incentive to make exaggerated claims about their capabilities or time spent making use of them in order to achieve that. If they're really spending hours of their life on this then it's incredibly sad.
---
I see that Bethesda thinks several thousand people is "small"
---
If you take workshops you're just making yourself someone elses entertainment. even if you "git gud" they will just cheat. I do not take them at all anymore. also just an FYI you can be ganked if you are just in the area, they can contest and if you're in the circle they can pop ya.
---
I sell them for 100. It may take a few days but eventually someone arrives who buys ALL OF THEM. Nice source of income. Don't care what happens with them.
---
Yeah been playing a bit and was all fine. Someone accused me of being a hacker because I went to their camp, bought something and opened the stash box. Prolly thought I am stealing his stash items.
---
I was also naked because I transfered my armor to my stash for anti-hack before, so that was suspicious lol.
---
A YouTube video of a hacker using the exploit.  It takes all of 3 seconds to use to take everything a player has on them.  The hardest part is moving from target to target and getting within 200m of them in a decent time, apparently.
---
Im pretty sure the patch was to ban the accounts causing the problems. Lol.. gotta love Bugthesda
---
Wrong. Go back to school boyo.
---
It's a post-it on the server that says "no u"
---
It's all standard political bullshit. They need such statements to calm down the playerbase and to make an attempt to stop the panic. I don't want to sound condescending but many people will rather believe that sort of "official statement" than some other people's reports that do not have meaningful proofs. Yes, we have that video with hundreds of people robbed blind, "but Big B said it's just a small amount of players, the problem is not on a sheer scale, it's gonna be ok!" - this is what a regular Joe would think after reading such statements.
---
Yeah, I've limited sympathy, players have been burned by this game so many times and keep lining up for more.
---
The same people who verified that the hack was plausible have said that the patch did successfully change the attack mechanism so it can't be done now.
---
Really curious as to why a year later and all these continuous debacles anyone bothers with this game. There's plenty of better stuff out there without the stress and wasted time.
---
It’s the same mentality as short selling stock.
---
They had a whole world set up for anyone who wanted to pvp. I'm assuming that it didn't work out because they were faced with other people who also had a build to pvp. Way easier to take from a majority on adventure mode players that don't won't to pvp. Understood about the work shops but I'm pretty sure they know there going to take it your caps and the loot fairly easy. Bullying any level is wrong they can tell pretty quick who there fighting and with that knowledge I've still seen some of these guys destroy someone that clearly has no chance. Not sure if this makes much sense,or if it's going to make a difference.
---
Up to 50 caps per death. Armour condition
---
50 caps
---
"A few players" looking at this shameless garbagr company trying to downplay the severity of the exploit.
---
Yes. G-strings or tongs instead or grandma's undies
---
We don’t need anti cheats systems but belief in our husband Todd Howard. For he can do no wrong, no matter how hard he beats us.. it will always be our fault.
---
Quite funny a nearly billion dollar company failed to avoid the avoidable
---
Gotta move your camp to find that radio lmao
---
What platform
---
Reveling in the misfortunes of others is a deplorable form of humor. 
---
You enjoy it. I don’t. 
---
Have a good day.
---
I sell them cos people buy them! :)
---
I could modify the script to auto-grab all items from all players, scrap all the items, and server hop.  
---
If I was a terrible person, I could probably wipe all inventory from *every player* in a couple of days.  Just have my PC do the work.
---
I dont go for anyone under 100 personally. And even then most players I encounter will just whine that they lost a pvp battle. I dont even take the junk unless the other guy was trash talking or being annoying
---
Once they solve this. I'm resuming my gifting on 1~2 * legendaries to low level. Have some decent 1,5,10 level weapons n armours for newbies all max out damages. Happy holidays
---
Stadia
---
I have a bit of a system for this.
---
Level 5-59: Do not engage
---
Level 60-99: Probably engage, depends on my mood
---
Level 100+: No holds barred
---
When I was first getting into PvP, I took out a level 38 guy. Took a bunch of bulk junk and whatnot. I didn't feel good about it, so I haven't griefed since. If you're adequately leveled, I assume you're able to defend yourself. Took out a 98 and a 218 today. That's fair as far as I'm concerned.
---
Well, stuff like Licensed Plumber, White Knight, Armorer and Gunsmith, I tend to swap out for use in CAMP and workshops.  It doesn't need to be on my loadout when I am on the move or in combat.  I always carry Thru-Hiker and Travelling Pharmacy though.  
---
If you can afford the mats, I can craft as many low level railway rifles for you to scrap as you want, so you can learn the mods for it. There's like only six mods or so, that I can recall offhand.  It wouldn't take much more than say 20-30 rifles to scrap if you have a decent Int and take Mentats before scrapping.
---
well they found a way for Skyrim and Fo4 anyway though with the CreationClub
---
but we'll see how long it takes until some crazy modders decide to pull a 'GTA RP' approach and mod a whole new game using the assets from Fo76 and offer it as '76 fixed' or '76 how it should've been'
---
Didn't he warn Bethesda about his hack before releasing the hack?
---
This company has absolutely no shame. They are changing the narritive and you FO76 fools are going to let them get away with it again. You all deserve much more than having all your items stolen.
---
I fully expect the "fix" to delete all your characters
---
Its an 8 minute video idiot. Have you tried rendering videos on a crappy computer?
---
You know how to fix this shit?
---
Dump the entire multiplayer bull shit, add NPCs, and rework it back into a normal, semi functional standard Bethesda release before allowing modest to fix it. 
---
The pvp crowd is already mostly gone or just griefing, so it’s no big loss and win win for real fallout players.
---
Well? If it says to start a new character, that’s what you have to do. Isn’t rocket science.
---
I can't speak on the code part but as for the help desk there's no way everyone will have off. Depending on if the team is in house or outsourced, there will most likely be a smaller group of people who have to work on the holidays and it's about 1/3 the staff as normal but it could also just be an outsourced group who's full staff. Either way still blows unless they signed up for it and don't care about the holidays.
---
Sounds like someone has had access to your PC, no way could computer maintenance delete characters from a game that was not running at the time, the game character data is held on Bethesda servers.
---
I've done full deletion of my main SSD, reinstalled windows and the game a few times as a refresh it was always fine.
---
Try signing out and in to Bethesda launcher a few times.
---
Someone's been naughty this Christmas
---
Yeah no shit, I was asking about my 5 characters I had on there before the maintenance.
---
His country of origin is Canada apparently (its on his account details). I don't know if that's true (probably not!) but they could trace him through that hacking forum and file lawsuits against him, inform any ISP he uses about what he does in his spare time.
---
Post of the day!
---
Never actually found a decision on which path to choose and which faction to support for their end game quest chain
---
Ur lucky
---
Mods on this sub are working directly with Bethesda some directly for Bethesda, and have always censored free speech to protect those Intrests- if the game was worth the effort, there would already be a Bethesda influence free sub to take over.
---
STOP BUYING AND PLAYING FALLOUT: 76
---
They’re gone. Done and dusted. Maybe contact support and you’ll get a few hundred atoms for your troubles.
---
I think a free month of private server is in order
---
Poor Santa 😥
---
At no point did I say I was better than anyone else. Infact, it's the opposite.
---
Secondly, again, 20k-30k rising and falling a few thousand every few moments isn't a big deal. You're focusing on the macro and not the micro; and trying to argue about it. The point being that "PEOPLE STILL FUCKING PLAY THE GAME DUMBASS".... 
---
So anymore silly arguments on your part of you wanna keep this going? Cause I'm never going to bend to your insults or your will. You wanna say "Troll!" like a spoiled SJW and make arguments over something small instead of focus on the larger picture of things. 
---
500+ people is a lot to be hacked when your population is on average 32k+ people. And the fact that the hack IS open for anyone to use, we can assume that number of affected individuals has grown.  But hey, keep acting like a stuck up twat. Instead of pushing for Bethesda to fix the issues so the playercount can grow. 
---
I want this game to succeed. I wanna see 100k+ Players.  But these issues, and these shitbag hackers, and Bethesda's broken updates are hurting the game. They need to change the formula. They need to either 
---
A: Open the game up for everyone to host without paywalls and manage their own servers.
---
B: Improve the game themselves instead of relying on modders.
---
C: Drop the game and focus on SP only games.
---
true. but considering 90% of their job consists of sending pre-made automated responses, they could pull it off while drunk on eggnog and singing christmas carols.
---
so again, I find it hard to take pity on anyone putting in that low of an effort.
---
Hey, jesus and u have something in common
---
This guy is just a terrorist. It's all a matter of degree, no he's not actually killing anyone, or physically hurting someone, but he/they are
---
terrorizing people who have done nothing to them. Except enjoy a game they don't like for whatever reason. None of those reasons are good enough to fuck people over like this. 
---
In a perfect world they'd get shoved into general pop and get passed around like a lollipop.  Doubt there's any justice in this, I hope they test positive for something deadly one day and die slowly and painfully.
---
You only have yourself to blame
---
After my last really intricate build I’m lazy to make another camp since it takes so much time.
---
Weirdchamp
---
Yes, very true.
---
I used to say no- it's fine, back in the good ol' days.  It was a way for people to meet one another, fast-travel, start groups and run content.  
---
Nowadays, what with the PVP-ambushing and griefing, the stealing, it's all just bad juju.  I don't accept random invites anymore.  It sucks, but I learned to be careful.
---
Im telling you that theyre downplaying the severity of the hack. Why do people support these guys again?
---
I have to admit I was a player of 76 back in the first few weeks. But now I’m actually enjoying the game more than ever.
---
I'm likely going to take a break and just play destiny 2 for the time being, the risk isn't worth it atm
---
I mean i laughed.
---
I'm playing a heavily modded FO4 character now too. It's kind of funny how much of a breath of fresh air FO4 is. It plays a lot smoother, there's at least some semblance of a story/world, survival mode, and mods really make it great.
---
Anti material rifle. Deliverer
---
He's not the creator, just the one using it in this video.  I don't think the creator warned beth about it beforehand.
---
They would have to shut the servers down for literally about a month if past experience is anything to go by and there is just no way they are going to do that.
---
They even added "equipped" as if to say they didn't lose many items. When in reality they lose everything.
---
Not true. This is an online game and your character, progress is saved on a Bethesda server. Bethesda making maintenance changes or updates could easily delete his characters
---
Well seeing as they did exactly that. IT is a Christmas miracle. :P
---
These people have a motive. This bashing has lasted an entire year. This isn't just for the fuck of it. Someone gets something out of this. 
---
Any company that isn't Beth is Beths competition and could be threatened by Beths sales into this kind of game. 
---
I'm saying shitting on Beth while pushing a game is something companies and advertisers are engaging in..not even talking just this game.. and it's a shitty thing to do but there are no rules or laws stopping them and this is about PROFITS.
---
Lolwat? You don't just ask the folks at AWS to restore from a backup. That's not how it works at all.
---
I started a new character tonight, played for about an hour.  i am probably going to stay away till this all clears up.  (IF it all clears up)
---
Private servers aren't safe either!
---
This is the guy who also released the last two major exploits. The swapping items from one to another like a box turned into the prydwynn, and the dude who put the hack out that let people spawn npcs.
---
Totally agree. 100 is way too much!
---
Have fun and join 😂😂
---
Well seeing as they took down the servers literally 3 hours before you posted. You should really pay attention.
---
Oh you must be one of those "few" players. Thank god you only lost your equipped items
---
I'd explore trapper camps for ideas.
---
Its a shame there isn't more far harbor and nuka world type items out there though
---
Ppl affected bought the game ages ago so don't worry
---
You'd think that, but not always. There's people who commit worse crimes than hacking in a game, but they still get caught due to stupid mistakes.
---
Snowden posts on YouTube and FB also, being in Russia places them outside of US jurisdiction.
---
I guess this gives me a chance to finish my latest run through of FONV.
---
&gt; Someone gets something out of this. 
---
Yeah, the hackers that are getting some luls.
---
There are rumours on this subreddit that there is a deletion hack being worked on even. What a scary time to play this game.
---
Nice tey, Bethesda devs
---
But are you having fun?
---
Execs ha e little to do with how patches are handled. There are issues of comptence at all levels.
---
Submit a ticket.  So sorry this happened to you.
---
Also don't forget... "Private" servers aren't guaranteed to be safe either!
---
Virtual machines bypass hardware bans.
---
I beleive people who have lost characters in the past have gotten them back so hopefully you're in the same boat
---
All bullying is wrong. It's like saying only bullying kids are bad but it's OK with adults. Same deal.
---
I did. the game is deader by the day.
---
It is annoying when I make a tactical decision to secure a camouflaged position only to be forced to open fire on a hostile target.
---
Trying to make this game run stable for 20 mins requires users to have a masters in Information systems services
---
I don't know. People gave golds to the "Pride and accomplishment" comment even though that was corporate wash.
---
I guess people just like rewarding notable comments. I can understand that.
---
Nah, they should do the opposite. We need more. PvPvE is fun.
---
Software eula and ToS aren't legally binding.
---
how will bethesda sue them? because bethesda owns everything, taking your own things is not against the law is it?
---
Maybe if they put some time and money into a proper anticheat system they wouldnt have this problem.  No sympathy from me
---
They're trying to downplay the seriousness of this...
---

Will it ever be? Was it ever before?
---
The bug is still 'there' in so far as, if you lost stuff, it hasn't been replaced yet.   But you're right, if people don't play the game then they're not getting hacked.   I just hope their fix isn't a quicky that patches this one issue and leaves us open to the next variation in a week's time.
---
Loose your camp.

You pc masterbates dont deserve a free month of 1st for any reason. Ask your mommy to change your diaper &amp; pay for 1st like everyone else.

I haven't played this shit game in over 6 months.
---
Im not complaining. I quite enjoy the drama
---
I'm more interested in how you made 700,000 caps lol
---
They removed the ability to inject scripts. IT was done earlier today.
---
Does being in pvp let ppl damage your camp? I do a ton of pvp but have never tried to hurt camps or done pvp at mine
---
Australia burnt to the ground, the British had an election, a Star Wars film came out and unaccountably Poe and Finn weren’t ****** (for spoilers) and I think the president of Americaland was impeached or something.
---
\&gt;which **may** have resulted in a **few** players losing items that their characters had **equipped** 
---
Corporate bullshit, trying to minimize the significance of this issue. What a joke Bethesda. 
---
Every step of the way, you prove the thing you care about most is perpetual revenue and the player experience be damned.
---

Idk why I'm down voted for saying, I didnt see it either... someones butthurt for nothing....

This is the case of most dupers I met. I still report those who sell them for real money though and disapprove of those who jack up the ingame prices.

If it can be shown someone's hacking has incurred a financial loss, including just haveing to clean up the mess they made, but also including loss due to business being affected (Atom Shop purchases) you could be prosecuted. at least in the USA and many other countries.
---
500 atoms seems more than enough.
---
He is russian, nothing they can do legally against him.
---
On one hand, yeah that sucks for them, on the other hand this (and the whole list of other BS that has clogged this game) should never have happen in the first place. Certain people within Bethesda should be put to blame for this. Maybe not ruining Christmas kind of blame but still. Incompetence like this is a step too far in my opinion.
---
fixer &gt; handmade &gt; combat
---
.45 is more common than 5.56
---
explosive means less ammo spent but ffr is generally better because bats have an abnormally high defense against explosives, plus the game is still broken and heals explosive damage.
---
Well then, if they *said* they would do it, everything will be fine! I mean, it's not like they've ever gone back on their word before...
---
I need the ghoul if that’s cool 😊
---
I read this in my head with a Mr. Prizebot voice. 😂
---
Being hostile to another player opens you up to your camp being damage or destroyed. My advice stick clear of team invites from people you don’t know. 
---
Sometimes it could be a miss click of the mouse for someone trying to fast travel or it could be with ill intent. Stay safe out there.
---
Same here brother
---
I totally understand why you dont like it. And reddit is a place for people to vent. But what pisses me off is sensitive people who downvote things that they don't like.  Upvote from me
---
Dang, that is bad
---
Dont worry. Fallout 69 will be out soon and Bethesda will screw u from both ends
---
I had fun durning the beta until I realized that just because they released the full game doesn’t mean it has to actually function. Then they wouldn’t fix or add the most basic things that the community wanted. And then they added fallout 1st. What a fucking cash grab of a game. It’s disgusting. Bethesda should be better than that. A real EA move. It’s sad to see a good developer go down the drain
---
Cool story. 
---
 'Dude' you talk down to people who like things that you don't. 
---
  Enough said.
---
It's those simple minded folk
---
This is where being a console pleb like me is a good thing: we’re safe from the hack. 
---
This is me feeling really sad for not being part of the “PC Master Race”...not.
---
woo! can't wait
---
It always amazes me how much people are willing to be shit on by a corporation.  its like an abusive relationship in some ways.   it reads like employees are in here defending the company's statement.   But its actually just huge fans of the company.  its crazy.
---
It's an easy mark to make fun of, so if someone's having a bad day they'll come shit on the 76 community because internet.
---
Engine wants to feel important sometimes, so they'll jump on the band wagon of hate for this game.  Every post after the game first came out is essentially the mook in the back behind the actually tough guy saying "Yeah!".
---
Primitive reactions for social status that doesn't exist, but it makes them think in their lizard brains that they're less likely to be murdered by an alpha, with maybe more chance of gaining access to mates.  It's sad to watch, but unfortunately a part of the human condition, especially in the age of the internet.
---
I'm always game for pvp so I accept them after plopping down my tent and storing my junk, but that's some sound advice. Cheers
---
&gt; You don't use the listen function correctly here. I suggest you try reading forums and historical posts before you make ridiculous comments.

Learn to use reddit, **pirateglenn1** .

This is not how you reply to people.

That's not correct.

Fully close the both the game and launcher and restart both apps.

Unmmm...... maybe this has something to do with fact Bethesda just used Fallout 4 to make the game and basically applied a mod to make 76

---
Get yo shit together, and fix this you dumb sacks of shit.
---
Oh, I already have maxxed Class Freak. Effects shows -1 ST for Bird Bones, -1 ST for Eagle Eyes and &gt;-1 ST for Egg Head. Hmm, I wonder if Class Freak doesn't affect Egg Head, since without Class Freak, Bird Bones is -4 ST, Eagles Eyes is -4 ST and Egg Head is -3 ST.
---
Agreed, a big thanks to all the devs and staff that have been working on these issues!
---
The mod that was used to hack will be modified to counter the changes to the game and be activated shortly
---
They are probably going by the number of tickets people have opened rather than some video of dubious origin.

I found the wikia write-up that has the components needed.  It looks pretty accurate.   There's a total of ten possible mods for the rifle, according to the Wiki.  
---
* https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Railway_rifle_(Fallout_76)
---
The screws are the most expensive components.  As far as the plan for the Railway Rifle, my memory was that they were a rare drop, but things may have changed.  In fact if memory serves, I think people said they were eventually added to Wallace and the Free States Vendor in White Springs.
---
Nah how about you buy Fallout First for 99.99 US dollars?
---
agreed
---
also explosive breaks faster, because every hit counts as 2 (or more) and your weapon condition goes down with every hit on a target
---
i dont have much experience with the Fixer, but if it behaves like a combat rifle, then i personally would prefer the handmade. but the 45 is definitly more common
---
Now I've heard ffr is better for pvp and explosive is better for over. Is that true? And what do you mean it heals explosive damage? Like the enemies don't actually take as much damage as they should? And thank you for the help!
---
Logical replies with common sense content are often donvoted here.
---
wait...mag sizes are stored client-side? that would explain my 128-bullet-mag hunting rifle but how does one fix this?
---
Thought that was just some loading bug like having to reload when joining a new server sometimes
---
My comment came across as "this is your fault and you get what you deserve". That wasn't my intent and I added a edit to my comment. 
---
Edit: I forgot the quotation marks in the "you shouldn't have been playing this game". My intent was to say that Bethesda isn't effected about this hack more than the players. There's been bad news about this game since the day it came out. The players who still play this game are going to continue to play this game next week when everything is hopefully resolved. Therefore, Bethesda isn't losing anything, the players who continue to play this game, even with all the bad press and issues are the victims

Game of the Decade. Not a single cent spent and I've gotten so much enjoyment just. Right next to greats like Anthem and NMS.

But let's not forget the community that keeps throwing themselves into dumpster fires like this. I sincerely thank you.

I won’t play until I start seeing other kinds of stories beyond this. I quit back in May, and I’m still holding out hope. Huge fallout 1 fan. Laying in the shadows till the time is right.

I think people didn't quite believe that bethesda would do nothing in preparation despite a week's warning in advance
---
Merry Christmas from the great white north eh!

i play almost every day
---
and there are plenty of reasons to complain
---
I mean i hear you dude... i get you, but i spent my money loooooong ago, and i got back in October, shit was looking up... DAMN sure better than it was when i bought the game for 30 bucks. Iv'e had my fun, and i don't even expect a refund, but when a guy like me is done with you, he's DONE with you, and that means your entire f'ing studio. I'm a patient guy, until i'm not. :D
---
While you are absolutely right - a new or old engine can be equally buggy or poorly thought out, or rushed - I think the one here is a special case.
---
The engine for FO76 originally came from *before* Morrowind (2001). It was a multiplayer engine, which was then heavily modified to be singleplayer for Morrowind. It has been patched and modified and enhanced over the years, but you can find bits and pieces of it stemming all the way back to then.
---
It's fuckin' bad. They need to ditch it. I know just how great it is having an environment they know like the back of their hand and how there's no overhead to make anything new, but this is ridiculous.

Bethesda could have done something earlier if the vulnerability was reported directly to them, in detail, instead of vaguely exploiting it in a campaign of hatred and fear. They weren't "demonstrating it" on YT to address a security flaw, they did it (and carefully timed their PR stunt) to create maximum mayhem and they had a willing partner in crime. Showing off the results without providing the method (not that the script should have been publicized either) in no way assists Bethesda in fixing the problem. These people are not white hats, and neither is the stooge who was more than happy to serve as their middleman by giving them all the attention they so desperately wanted. That person is as innocent as a mafioso's lawyer. They're advancing a personal agenda by terrorizing the user base and trying to destroy a game that many people still love. I hope the banhammer is merciless.

---
(personally rate f76&lt;f1&lt;f4&lt;f3&lt;NV&lt;F2, from worst to best.)
---
What's the point of this post? Are you saying it's okay now because it took them a few days to fix a game breaking vulnerability in the code? Or are you trying to invalidate anybody daring to complain about this ruining their day? Or are you saying it's absurd that given bethesda's track record, people aren't skeptical of the supposed patch?

They fixed it *for now*. I guarantee that the hackers who made and used this code are already working on getting it working again. Add in the fact that there are more hackers then Bethesda programmers and that they're more motivated than anyone "working" on 76, I dive it a week, tops, before we're right back where we started. 
---
TL;DR Fallout 76 PC is dead.
---
So why be active in this subreddit?
---
Yep
---
yo check it out homie, i got you in 3 different instances. Not that Bethesda gives a shit... but i'm still outing your ass for the dirty shit you do. That might make you happy, idc, truly lol, but i still enjoy exposing your bullshit. Have a great Christmas pal.
---
Terrorizing.. oh my. Please step back from the computer and rejoin reality mate.
---
Not master race but some like me have never owned a gaming console and just naturally migrated my PC use from work in about year 2000 to a home PC and the odd game. Only ever played Eve Online, Half Life and Fallout 3, NV, 4 and 76. 
---
I wouldn't know what to do with a console tbo 🤷‍♂️
---
Awesome build! I'd gladly visit your cozy home! What's your ign?
---
No need for a patch, by the time Wastelanders comes out only one person will be playing this dumpster fire.
---
Where? The videos I viewed had no where near 500 people being affected.  The 500 number is just hearsay.
---
May have dodged a bullet right there!
---
Did you count the players?  No where near 570.
---
None of the above, I am more complaining about the idiots who whine about things that are not there or where fixed already.   
---
A lot of people here seem to just be here to cause Drama.
---
I bet they are going to pay everyone like 50 atoms for that item shop as an apology for the "inconvenience" lol
---
Hey I'm interested. Did you delete, or are the mods deleting posts for Bethesda to save face
---
Please, he won't get shit. They might even find a way to charge him for deleting his character, call it a 'service.'
---
How do you know that? Russia is the typical stereotype that comes up when people mention hackers though.
---
I really hope you sinking 200 pounds thing is just a joke.
---
Just make a new alt, load them with caps from your other chars and send them shopping at other players' vendors. Stash everything you buy immediately. Maybe prices will go down as nobody's buying anymore.
---
Have a wonderful Christmas yourself u/fallout457 !
---
So 45 basecost for full price retail upon release
---
And then atom shop purchases throughout the year
---
you actually believe that this game has no flaws?
---
What if you build a "house" with no walls, or ceiling, or doors even.
---
Cool man thanks
---
Definitely the decor from here
---
Lmfao this is fucking gold.
---
The 14,000 XP one should be the last for Christmas. Hopefully it’s also the last they’ll ever add for such stupid amount of XP
---
I've been loving my first month of 1st, for the price of one meal out or a take away it's great having the world to myself.
---
I'm sure you deserved it. Probably used the new hack or something.
---
Or is it incredibly accurate and the game is just crashing that many times kicking players off?
---
But yes, I see its true nature now.
---
Thank you very much ! :) 
---
Also, a very sudden point, would 1600 caps be reasonable for an unyielding poison resist combat chest? Last unyielding part I need.
---
especially around christmas time... The joy of waking up and looking up on reddit what new 'gifts' the hackers present us today
---
Ok.
---
:D
---
Heh.   You almost had me.   Good one.   Now go find a new Vault Dweller coming out 76 and give them a bunch of ammo, water, and new weapons and armor!
---
\^This, 100%
---
Yeah, No. nice try. Been playing since beta no hacks. Go away troll.
---
Without your password? Mine is very long and random from my key manager.
---
No I haven't been deleting, I've seen alot of downvotes bots on here though, probably Bethesda Public relations
---
That was a ps for your post. I posted a funny post and it got a few fanboys in it lol.
---
\[here's a montage of one player stealing the inventories of over 500 players\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk) )
---
B
---
fuck i messed up
---
All you care about is shitting on Bethesda.
---
I clearly explained the situation, I pointed out how Bethesda HAS responded to the previous incidents and they were very fast to fix the last hack as it was done in three days and the hacker confirmed it was impossible to try and make that hack work again.
---
It IS EXTREMELY important who makes the hack, this guy has openly expressed hating Bethesda and that being the source reason for why he is making the hacks, we are quite likely to see a lawsuit from Zenimax/Bethesda next year and issuing a life time ban against the guy for ALL Zenimax/Bethesda products.
---
I proved you wrong on them drumming up hype for Wastelanders, and even youtubers like YongYea was forced to praise how quick Bethesda was to fix the previous hack.
---
But right now Bethesda staff would be on holidays as it's the week of Christmas, ALL video game studios shut down this week, from Bethesda to Digital Extremes to Ubisoft to Blizzard there is NO video game developer in action during this time, that's why the hack was released today to cause maximum damage at the worst time.
---
But they haven't released it to non-payers and mod support.
---
Will I be getting my weapons back?
---
Yeah it's 14k for this. Yeah I think a 7k should be the most, each item is adds 1k a day so like day 5 would be 5k xp
---
Interesting.  I have several hundred hours in and I so rarely experience that.
---
That’s ok. All letters are accepted here
---
That's what you get for hacking 😡.
---
Seriously though, submit a support ticket, but I doubt they can do anything.
---
I'm fully expecting Bethesda to slow walk this to try and 'force' people to sub to Fallout 1st. I just hope people stop playing, instead.
---
welcome to the sub, you most be new here..
---
I hope so, maybe the game will lag less and I don't have to waste dud bullets on unresponsive enemies
---
"A few members"
---
Like there wasn't a video of a guy who robbed more than 500 people. I wonder what % of their player base that is and how many people they lost from it
---
I did submit a ticket, no hacks here. BTW happy cake day.
---
I'd honestly say it's a little on the low side.  Do you absolutely have to have it be a Combat Chest?
---
possible result of Bethesda doing a 'fix' to remove characters that profited from any of the reported people losing gear? IE: they removed the 'stolen' items in the most basic and brutal way they could think of on the fly, before they 'restore' to prevent duping the items in the fix.
---
If that's the case, and you are one of those who went around being a sloppy turd using some exploit someone else wrote, I feel no sympathy for you, but if you are truly innocent of any wrongdoing and this really happened, I am deeply sorry and can only suggest you report it to Bethesda ASAP (And I hope they respond quickly)
---
If you buy the new Fallout 2nd you can invade private servers, Dark Souls style!
---
That's hilarious that the Downvote bots chose my one comment about Todd Howard to Downvote hahahahahaha
---
Yeah, I think mods are going through just deleting obviously negative posts.
---
It’s like 27,000 for all items as they’re not like the Halloween ones where you can progress them all at the same time. I was fine with the Halloween ones, but this is overkill
---
Fallout 76 has one of the best communities in gaming despite all of the terrible press it constantly gets. It's totally normal to have higher levels literally throwing piles of items at your feet no matter which gender character you are. Almost all Fallout 76 players pass on the kindness of others so we have a very positive loop always in play that benefits everyone in the long run.
---
 Bethesda isn’t capable of doing that to themselves?
---
You never played this game, prove me wrong.
---
Waiting for the upcoming fix to fix the fix made to fix the hacks 😂
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs
---
No not particularly, I've just collected a set of Unyielding BOS combat so it fits nicely
---
Even so, that’s a few more than 500-700.
---
 Can I pose a question?  
---
How do you kill what is dead?  
---
I just shoot from the hip  
---
And I aim for the head
---
He used to be your friend  
---
That was another life  
---
With a single bullet  
---
We're gonna blow his mind
---
With a loaded gun  
---
And a steady hand  
---
We just might live through this (Aim for the head)
---
  
---
If you kill the brain  
---
Then you kill the ghoul  
---
And its motor functions (Aim for the head)
---

---
Fallout 76 is disappointment.
---
I don't think this is overly negative though, it's a solution to the problem of the game. Whether they like it or not shouldn't really be up for debate
---
I enjoy the game and I complain, hella I encourage people to keep bitching and complaining. If people say "ohhh yeah great camp items and game no problems here" they DEFINITELY won't fix fucking anything (not that they're really fixing a lot but you know)
---
How can you prove they lied?
---
I was told that u created the hack
---
Fo76 is a social experiment in itself exploring Stockholm syndrome.
---
im sorry but these hackers are what was needed, this game was a money grab and pseople that support it are harming all of gaming, you're letting companies know that they can pull this shit and you will still reward them for it. so its good that someone kneecaps your gaming experience because they want bethesda to know that its just going to keep coming and coming. Bethesda isint willing to spend enough money to fix this game, so if your still paying for this its just going to keep happening.   
---
I was a long time fall out fan, and lucky for me bethesda pulled fallout 76 from steam the day before i was going to buy it. im so glad they saved me from this crap.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I spent HOURS AND HOURS farming my gear, and now some of my best pieces are gone
---
Well, I guess we've learned our lesson. 
---
"Crime doesn't pay!"
---
Except if it didn't, no one would do it.
---
Since it appears fixed on PC I would imagine that console players will get the fix shortly. Until then maybe just use private servers if you can.
---
I sure would be. Thankfully the exploits been fixed
---
Exactly right. That’s why they’ll charge for this
---
Yeah he should’ve just uploaded an entire night’s worth of hacking. That sure sounds like a good use of his bandwidth. /a
---
He’s rather use that time to steal more from the blokes that still play this trash heap
---
Oh it's back though. I couldn't actually read your post previously because it said it was deleted. But now it's back
---
&gt; Been playing since beta 
---
Yeah, you deserved it.
---
Hes gonna read the entrails of the squirrels he killed
---
The game represents everything they hate in gaming and gaming industry. DLC? Private servers? Launch a bugged out game? No communication from devs? Ripping off players while giving influencers everything they asked for? 
---
It's basically bingo for "shitty business practices."
---
Why would anyone still be playing this broken joke of a game?
---
Bethesda, you fucked up.
---
Definitely. Rough guesstimate is around 30k-ish. I’m just using one character, I’ve seen others who are way over that.
---
OK, I thought the OP was referring to Maintenance of their OWN PC 🥴
---
I'm going to accept this L right now, but today is not my day isn't it?
---
Few, small number of, etc.
---
Bethesda doesnt fucking care
---
Ok, ty.   I had a noob trying to come near me today and I just ran away in fear of it being some hacker default account.  I'm a level 80 scared of noob accounts now.
---
If you can guarantee, could you provide evidence of it affecting console users? I'm interested
---
GT HasNoStyle
---
^ This. I've taken to keeping a crossbow on me specifically for critters. Easy kills, and a good way to get stimpacks and the occasional armor or nuke code.
---
There's quite a few people that afterwards even admit they were lying. Others state things we know to be impossible. 
---
If you have a firm "provide proof or GTFO" policy it would at least limit things.
---
Bethesda won't give free anything. They'll keep raping your wallets.
---
Soyboys. The answer is always soyboys.
---
Bethesda has lost all good faith with most consumers. Only you people are left hoping they'll change.
---
I know it's standard PR bullshit but it always annoys me when companies try so hard to downplay shit like this
---
&gt;We are investigating **reports** of a PC-only exploit that **could be** abused by cheaters, which **may have** resulted in **a few players** losing **items that their characters had equipped** (you mean their entire fucking inventories?)   
---
&gt;While we’ve determined that **only a small number** of characters have been negatively affected
---
Wrong.
---
Well...  you can always check around that 'other' subreddit that-shall-not-be-named.  There's likely someone that might have something along those lines, althought most folks tend to scrip two-stars these days and only sell/trade three-stars.  
---
I myself happen to have a Unyielding Poison Durability Robot Chest on my trades list.  But I think I'd ask for a bit more than 1600 caps for it.
---
1 billion
---
How can I? Upload a screenshot of my 3 characters, A level 130, a 101, and a lv 9. The Level 130 having a TSE Laser Rifle that had a camp near the train station at Watoga that also suffered a crash during his first nuke event against the scorchbeast queen. Can't even show off my 40+ screenshots because a bug somehow deleted them all.
---
I mean this with the utmost respect but I don't need to prove anything to you but if you really must look up my gamertag on Xbox and you'll see I have almost every achievement but 2. I'll dm it to you on request.
---
Maybe to ensure that people saw it
---
Hey, just type your original sentence into the mindless checker on Grammarly. The mindless machine was able to find the same grade school error that you can't seem to see.
---
I mean Al Qaeda was known to upload videos to YouTube back in the 2000s. Clearly didn't make it any easier to go after them. 
---
The US doesn't have an extradition treaty with Russia. Even if we did, why would Russia or the US go to all that trouble to arrest someone for hacking in a video game?
---
I highly doubt it...but I hope your right. #cashgrab #classicbugthesda
---
In what way do you disagree? It's demonstrably true that eso gameplay is vastly different to what you find in all TES games since daggerfall.
---
Why are you even still here? I haven't played in like six months but I try to keep up with the game in hopes it will get better. Yet somehow I don't go around acting like a petulant child.
---
They’ve been up for hours now.
---
it is. you can mitigate most explosive damage with the fireproof perk and a dense chest armor mod.
---
for pve, it's like I said: scorchbeasts have an abnormally high defense against explosives. it works wonders against everything else, and is even stronger than ffr as a rule of thumb. but then you have to account for the healing bug.
---
the common theory is that the game assumes you're dealing too much damage too fast (because of the multiple projectiles) and reduces your output, healing the target. it doesn't always happen and is seemingly worse in laggy servers.
---
And I just finished my set of T-51b plans.
---
The only mistake I see here is you attempting to defend this game/developer at all
---
Sorry but no. Bethesda has this stupid policy of banning anyone they feel are taking part in cheating or hacking. Ill let Bethesda figure it ou on their own.
---
Well it's also because the game is MADE to be modded, providing an experience that gives players that much individual freedom while being online is very difficult.
---
Sorry... signing in...
---
To watch it burn.
---
I hate that people do this. One second youre enjoying the game and just minding your own business and the next, everything youve worked for in the game is just taken from you by some buffoon. And what annoys me more is that bethesda is gonna do nothing to the victims of this hack. "Want all your items back? We can give you 500 atoms that cant even buy you an in game fridge at best."
---
my thanks to the developers who no doubt spent weekend and holiday time to work on this.
---
Given your other comments here I would say you.
---
Same as always. Bitching here is outsized to actual impact.
---
Right. .....xbox here....Lol...wasnt sure where to place the Pc MaStEr RaCe comment so I will enjoy it quietly with you lol
---
That was patched prior to the assaultron key card was added into the game
---
If you understood how the hack worked, you would know that it can't work on consoles. There's a reason it only works on PCs. PCs are open. Consoles are locked down by Sony and Microsoft.
---
the dps of a fixer is slightly higher than that of a handmade.
---
Im staying in NW and grind for the Xmas reward instead of PVE gifts, shame but Im not risking my gears for some fancy holiday theme decors.
---
You seem unfamiliar with Bethesda. If you actually played the game, you'd know they often screw up the bug fixes.
---
Lmao at the fanboys downvoting you
---
I love the .45 SMG but its dps is nowhere near that of a handmade.
---
So you have proof but aren't willing to share?
---
You could make a throwaway and just blur out names and account details
---
It isn't, however due to the scarcity (and just luck) or acquiring plans for heavy leather armor and the marine wet suit still took me 24 hours. Can't reimburse time after all.  Regardless of what was exactly taken, I bet other players level 300+ with legendary loot are going to be pissed. Ultimately, you steal Ferrari or Lemon, you're still a thief. 
---
+ other players (at least reading the comments) have speculated it is just a hoax, this is more warning/confirmation post that this stuff is going on. I know the level 29 player complaining about leather armor is likely insignificant compared to the potential loses of other players (and let's face it, Bethesda isn't going to care either) but preventing other players from being hit is my goal. Like I mentioned in the OP, I have the plans and (Pack rat for the win!) plenty of resources to build again. But it is still frustrating. 
---
Stay safe bud!
---
Okay, have fun playing on ps4
---
I know that. I was there. I've been through everything this game has gone through.
---
Also I've found the railway plan in the Whitespring, couple hundred caps short though so I'll wait until vendors reset to sell some things.
---
He's full of it. It can't work on consoles, period. That's not how it works.
---
Thanks for stopping by. Have a cookie. 
---
🍪
---
Honestly, I thought it was 200%.
---
Bro. No you don’t. 
---
Devs make shit decisions and pay the price for those choices. 
---
If bethesda isnt going to care about you, why should you care or support them?
---
Exactly, when does hundreds of people qualify as only a few?
---
Oh that's right, when one of your biggest investors is about to pull out due to how big of a dumpster fire FO76 has been (and mind you, I do enjoy this game. I really miss the old Bethesda). I for one will be taking a break from the game. So peace of groovy peeps, be seeing you on the flip side.
---
Nah, im good.. not looking to have my Bethesda account banned.
---
Exactly!
---
Because despite this game I’m passionate about the Fallout universe.
---
But I mean, I roll Tommy B3325 casually around the place to clean up ect
---
Then switch to B5015 Handmade for SBQ. 
---
Hardy touch my B2525 Handmade lately.
---
Noticed that. At this point, surprised there are any fallout 76 fanboys left, honestly
---
Actually gonna just delete this thread
---
that's quite the slipper slope if I've ever seen one. just imagine, a bunch of people would've been banned earlier yesterday because the stealing hack was just "paranoia"
---
These hacks keep getting worse and worse, and undoubtedly there will be new and worse ones. On the bright side, the game is going to be so cool after we finish the B.E.T.A.
---
I play on Xbox, and I'm happy to keep playing on Xbox.
---
Are you going VATS or manual-aim?   
---
If VATS, you really want as light a rifle as you can manage.  The Handmade can get pretty hefty in weight if tricked out, the Combat Rifle isn't much better.  Unless you have WWR armor or a Reduced Weight Rifle, it's harder to use those heavier rifles with VATS.  
---
You might consider Bloody Lasers or Bloodied Plasmas to help cut down on the weight.  Or my favorite choice, the Bloodied Pipe Rifles.
---
I think the goal here is not to ensure they can never play again (as that’s impossible for a developer). But make it incredibly inconvenient/expensive for them, as they’d have to buy new hardware and another copy of the game.
---
Been playing bethesda games sense fallout 3, I Have also been playing games in general sense the early 2000s.  
---
Here is the thing, literally every damn game company out there with the exception of Nintendo breaks things with updates. bethesda is just the only one people call out for it.
---
Then stop posting trash in a subreddit for a game you dont even care about
---
Wow!    They must be really grinding to get to that number.  Unless they have a long list of repeat customers.
---
R/fallout
---
Ooof don’t throw it away. It’s lvl 50 high end PA. Plans to make it are on Taggerdys terminal in her office.
---
It simple really, there is no need to take the servers down.  Its an issue that effects an extremely small percentage of the player base.  Its far easier to just work on fixing the issue and restore items.
---
Started with 20k+ caps. 
---
Sold junk/gear/aid to vendor bots to clear out those 1400 caps. 
---
Bought all the wraps. Sold more stuff to clear out those refreshed caps. 
---
Went to another vendor. Repeat. 
---
Over the next few days I’ve done that over and over. 
---
I’m down to 800 caps. And I’m 100% okay with that.
---
Shoutout to my buddy retro, come hang out with us in our discord at omin13.com
---
Just to be clear, I asked for evidence of the hack, not you using it.
---
So how do you know its being used? I also noticed you have deleted the post. Bad sport chum
---
Those idiots make up a minority and are definitely not worth the attention of a post. That's the only reason they're here, for attention, thanks for giving it to them and encouraging more
---
Not everyone checks Reddit before playing. Crazy, right?
---
Something to do. I'm genuinely interested in why you post on a game you don't play?
---
Fun
---
If you think Bethesda is the worst company at communicating, I'd like to invite you to r/modernwarfare .
---
And they would have been able to show the proof.
---
It's about an expectation of proof along with a claim. 
---
I think we'd all have been more likely to believe that the hack was real if there wasn't 90 other posts that were absolute lies. 
---
This is exactly WHY this is needed, so that when actual serious issues happen people know that they can trust what they are reading here vs immediately assuming it's bullshit. 
---
I think a lot more people were affected because we've been conditioned on here to assume everything is a lie since so much of it is.
---
k thanks.
---
I swear theres going to be another hack where they get into private worlds
---
3 characters 25000-30000 each. Down to about 3000 on all 3! Still don’t have that moth man head.
---
"a few players"   
---
A few players? Just a few? I watched a video of a single hacker, just one, stealing inventory from hundreds of players. That was just from one hacker. What's your definition of "a few?"
---
This same scenario happened to me today on PS4 😳
---
Hardware bans only work for this end on console. Because it's prohibitively expense to buy another entire console. Hot swapping a few PC parts or changing the MAC ID is cheap and easy. So, that would really only stop a couple people, if anyone.
---
Where did I advocate 76? 
---
I simply called you what you are. 
---
You're the one making shit up as you go along.
---
I'm just gonna put this out there, Bethesda didn't fully patch the hack. you can still place items in others inventories. That being said, there is another hack on the way and from what I hear the hackers will be able to join private worlds very soon. Long story short Fallout 1st is not safe!
---
It took 3.75 hours for me to get 7,000XP yesterday. For a beanie.
---
Cant answer that without getting myself into trouble. Will leave it at that
---
You do realize that the mods can see the original content, right?
---
Nothing ever truly gets deleted from the Internet.
---
If this does not make you stop playing altogether, what will it take?
---
Seriously, stop, think about it, consider, and define a probable circumstance in which you would give up and never return.
---
I’m not expecting FNV, but at least a decent FO gaming experience of some kind.
---
Dude people consistently buy and them in bulk for 100 caps.  Sometimes less if they’re Forest. Keep them and put them in vending! It just takes the one player to show up and buy them all out.
---
I guess 76 IS their comedy so far ,they probably can't grasp it themselves how moddable and hackable this game is
---
&gt;ealing atom-shop items, it could be brought to court and charged for computer fraud? It is theft of monetary items at that point. Either manner, I suspect most people doing this are going to be using VPN's or proxies of some sort. Actually finding them would be pretty impossible at such point. The most they could do would continue to ban accounts involved. 
---
tell that to the rust cheaters that buy hundreds of copys for a reason know one knows. i would assume you have 2 groups of cheaters, thos for the luls and those that hate bethesda and want people supporting this abortion of a game to suffer to punish bethesda.... u think the  christmas timing was an accident...
---
He didn’t say anything remotely like that.
---
More so the question is why do players who hate the game waste so much time coming back over and over again just to bash. Act like a normal human being and go play something you enjoy and talk about something you enjoy instead of wasting time.
---
“It just works” and by it I mean the hacks
---
*Pickpocketing 100*
---
I'm genuinely interested why you think this game is such shit when you don't even fuckin play, you troll
---
Because your mom gave me crabs, and this is a lot more bearable.
---
Same here I tried really hard to like it but after 90 hours and 2 PC leveled up to 100+ I just couldn't bring myself to spend another minute grinding.
---
However, it's amusing watching the mental gymnastics around here. 
---
Also, I'd only end up resubbing each time more fallout drama happens so it's easier to just leave it in the feed rather than joining and leaving every couple of weeks.
---
Every sub is like this on Reddit.  The same comment will get you a sea of downvotes one day, and a sea of upvotes the next.
---
&gt;Bethesda help center personnel and programmers working.
---
Good joke, 10/10, would tell again.
---
I've read that giving awards to comments with negative votes prevents it from being hidden, dunno if it's true though.
---
The fallout Instagram page is crawling with them. If anyone calls out how awful fallout 1st is they just say “Lmao broke boy” instead of responding to criticism.
---
They are also very fond of blocking any accounts that criticize the game.
---
to this day people are downvoted to hell because they claim the game "ate" their equipment but can't provide proof since they're not recording 24/7. should they be banned?
---
I'm one of those people. I have lost several items to date and have 0 proof. should I be banned? even though someone did post proof at one point, months after the first few reports? in this case, would those people be retroactively unbanned?
---
seems like a waste of time to me. better to not scrutinize everything as if Bethesda could do no wrong.
---
yeah I hope it turns out to be fake too but after what we read and saw the last days....some would've claimed that to be impossible too until now so I guess lets wait and see what surprises we might get
---
Cool same here toad eye and I’m like may as well display it.
---
Can I try to help you find something better to do with your time? It seems like a lose-lose situation for you to be doing this.
---
I guess if someone already spent thousands of hours in a particular game it will be reason enough to support the developers just to not loose your progress when the game's gonna die... but everything comes to an end sometimes... and if it's just the patience of the players who're supporting from the beginning.
---
They have no model though
---
I'm a piece of shit who just decided to get back into this game after a year break. I then saw about this stupid hack and even purchased fallout 1st for the private server. I'm the biggest fucking idiot ever and a shame . But the heart wants what it wants.
---
Fuck this shit company and its low quality programmers . Fucking garbage assholes

Luck of the Draw works well for me - Since getting rank 3 of it, I rarely (almost never) have to repair my weapons. I had to take it off to do the Tadpole challenge that required me to repair a crossbow 3 times - I couldn't damage the crossbow to the point where the weapons bench would let me repair it. I don't think the notification that it triggered occurs every time.
---
Lucky Break doesn't seem to be as effective - after a long play session, my armor is often in need of repairs at a workbench.
---
Even a crappier experience 👍
---
I'm gunna be totally honest, I've never played the game. I'm only here to hold myself over until he makes a follow up.
---
You can call it whatever you want because I'm in no mood to play pedantic games, but the fact remains that they were using fear to serve their own cause and consequently a lot of people were (and some still are) afraid to play the game. The publisher is not a bystander who happened to witness a crime in progress, they're an insider who knowingly and willingly *assisted in the plot* and they're just as guilty as the hackers. Fuck every single one of those assholes.

No green stuff here.
---
Because experience varies sometimes.  I've encountered so few issues with my gameplay.  Of the ones I have encountered; server drops are the only real bothersome.  Of the few graphic anomalies I've seen, I only laughed at them and they caused zero game play issues.  Probably the more recently annoying, is melee not actually causing any damage.  Can't tell if it's just lag, or an actual game issue because it's rare and only happens with one enemy and usually only for a few hits.
---
I've been playing since the game came out, I'm level 120, haven't launched a nuke yet and only just recently gotten to a point where I've run out of missions to accomplish.  All I have are the daily quests to do.  So I've actually spent this time building up my camp to look much better than just four walls and some crafting stations.
---
Hate the game all you want, call it what you want, but I still sort of enjoy it.
---
Terms of service. All virtual items are the property of Bethesda. From a purely legal standpoint, no theft has occurred.
---
You could make a fair argument that it could be a civil case, but it would be extremely hard to draw a clear line between any 1 individual hacker and quantifiable damages. Especially since the obvious counter argument would be to simply subpoena documents and present clear evidence that two years of poor management led to a continual trend of loss.
---
Also on PC?
---
You know if they try to do this on PS4 sony will probably take action extremely fast on whoever tries it.
---
Only kind of thing's I know that work outright on console are modded controllers.

---
In the case of Russia though their constitution specifically bans extradition of their citizens which is why its such a hotspot for this sort of thing
---
I’m sure you’re reluctant to answer, but do you care to say exactly how you know that you can still place items in inventories?
---
i actually never mess with workshops because they're pvp zones and i don't want to pvp. see how simple that is?
---
You have to actually do some work to earn overtime.
---
Well, the hacker said that he was going to release his script on the 24th. Whether he just got it out early OR he has something else about to come out, who knows.
---
He's right. Naughty Dog constantly derped the Uncharted games with updates.
---
As a very broke boy, feel like criticizing fallout 1st isn't that unreasonable a thing. But maybe I'm in the minority and everyone else has deep pockets. More power to them if that's the case. And I'm not surprised to hear them blocking accounts. I just don't understand the die hard mentality behind it. Supporting a game that has a glitch or two is ine thing, but this is next level. Folks have lost stuff they've spent actual money on. That's valid enough by itself to warrant criticism.
---
Its literally a game, i dont understand how you can get so worked up when people kill you in a trap base its like a practical joke or do all snowflakes like yourself have no sense of humour? This is a survival game there should he dangers  its a fallout game they are traditionally somewhat dark get over yourself
---
Ida pro.  Welcome to the rabbit hole.
---
wah
---
there was a post a few weeks ago that bethsada planed this and wants the game to die, looks to be true from my perspective
---
Haha guys look how cool and edgy I am telling people that the game they play is bad, that’ll show them 😎
---
Once certain YouTubers covered it, it mobilized their respective shitposting mobs.
---
What do you actually win games or something? If not what’s your secret
---
The Entwives will come back. Eventually.
---
LUL
---
No it's not
---
I mean this seems to indicate it was only what they had equipped- look at the first guy sitting in chameleon, he loses his armor and goes visible. He goes and robs another guy. He STOPS at the first guy again and takes a gun he had just equipped. So therefore, it’s not the entire inventories, just the equipped items.
---
Downvoted?
---
Why?
---
Why put me on blast like that.
---
Ok drama queen. See you in a few days.
---
Please just don’t fuck up starfield and TES6
---
Here's the thing...  it used to be a bit of a open-secret amongst the really efficient clanners that treasure maps are the best way to get a TON of mats for multiple people (i.e. a clan) at once.  
---
You collect hundreds of maps, multiples of the same ones.  You group up, travel to the map spot and start digging.  **EVERYONE** in the group gets hella lot of stuff from every map used on that spot.  We're talking about several hundreds of pounds worth of stuff on each player.  My old clan would regularly waddle as a group from map dig to workbench, or move a camp nearby, just so we could accumulate thousands of pounds worth of materials for the clan.  
---
This is why treasure maps are so valuable.  Also the primary user of that stands a chance of getting rare plans per map use.  So... yea.  Maps are valuable.
---
Which investor is this?
---
I admit I haven't played it yet. I don't do online games because I don't like playing with other people. If this game was less buggy and private servers were free I probably would have played it with my wife at some point though.
---
Now? Hell no. 
---
Have a good Christmas :)
---
I play because I love the fallout universe and this game does have some neat things, albeit they are weapons and armors. The lore is fantastic and everything about it is appealing aside from the garbage multiplayer aspect and the issues that came with it.
---
Mostly I play to carefully observe model's bone weights as I port them over to **\[REDACTED\].**
---
Trolls love drama. Lol That’s what hating yourself leads to.
---
Yes, we played 12 rounds and won 10.
---
Honestly is there any point to you continuing to post that if you have no proof or new information? It's like someone pining over an ex. 
---
Trust me, I've been there. I was annoyed as hell with the game, I lost months worth of scrap initially when I was unaware that getting pushed into a fissure would make it irretrievable and was essentially told the same thing by support. It sucked but I moved on. 
---
At this point, either you got annoyed enough to stop playing, so why are you here? Or you moved on, took your loss and earned new gear. So why keep bringing up?
---
Some dude in Russia or wherever he lives? I'm sorry, but I think he doesn't give a single shit, and Bethesda is powerless to do anything to him. If he gets banned, he just buys another copy, and finds a way to get around whatever they do.
---
I own two copies of the game, i played up until last week. If someone bought the game, they have the right to complain about it, same as you. Just because they aren't playing it anymore doesn't mean their input isn't important. If i can stop one person making the same mistake i did of buying into this game, I've had value to someone, which is more than I can say about your post, OP.
---
Wah never changes
---
Welcome to the consumers understanding of "the cloud"
---
Any tips? It sounds like you play in a team, but I don’t have that luxury.
---
Yes, it's safe to play. No, they haven't returned the items. Bethesda hasn't announced their plans for that yet.
---
Again I disagree and don't think that's true. ESO does a great job of incorporating most of the elements from singleplayer TES games and aside from the flashier and deeper abilities the gameplay isn't far off either. I personally think ESO's combat is a total evolution over the singleplayer TES games. 
---
As I said though to each their own 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
If you had your gear stolen you need to submit a ticket. But they did a patch for pc earlier today so it should be okay.
---
Welcome Emmie!   I'm on PC, otherwise I'd totes offer to help.  But I am sure there's a bunch of Xbox folks that would be more than willing to team up, just gotta give em time to let em open up and not be shy!
---
Yeah but Bethesda's bugs have birthdays
---
2 Possible reasons:
---
They either found the game randomly in a trash bin
---
Or they have less than 50 IQ and purchase shit like Fallout 1st
---
I’m pretty far left but the entire right wing concept of “bugmen” is 100% true of a ton of people, and reddit is a hive of them.
---
Do you still have the handmade prime receiver
---
It just works
---
Juicehead had a video on it, I don't remember it's name as of right now. 
---
Stay away until they care about the game
---
Have a groovy holiday, yourself my friend.
---
Whats happened to f76 on pc? I've been out of the loop &amp; also play on console but, I keep seeing all these posts wondering whats happening lol
---
because it's still an unresolved issue affecting players? not that it has anything to do with the topic at hand.
---
*you* proposed that "liars" should be banned, and I said it was a stupid idea because such and such. now you're just deviating from the question you yourself brought up.
---
Awesome. Thank you for the help
---
Sure do! Join my server and come to my camp and it's yours. Gamertag is: Oliver Klohzof
---
Really? I didn't see any other camps when you were browsing your map?
---
41 posts, 1 yr old account (same time as game release). 
---
Omfg, Bethesda shills doing damage control...again.
---
&gt; Beth should be investigating any user who perpetrates this for criminal charges
---
No. Not this whatsoever. Bethesda allowed this hack to happen. This incredibly easy to hack game is Beth's fault. Every single game has hackers trying to break the code and these hackers have been able to break it over and over and over again.
---
There's hackers that break code because it's a bit of fun and they get a kick out of breaking a game, and then there's this. 
---
The fact that Beth has code vulnerable enough to have players' entire inventory straight up stolen from them (included paid-for items) is pathetic. And the fact that there's **STILL** people defending shows me there's simply people who put up with literally anything to stay loyal.
---
500 atoms lol
---
Normally vats. Do they heavier guns use more vats?
---
I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted....
---
You cant really help it, people are just addicted to giving bethesda money after getting backslashed 500 times, you can also call it masochism
---
Yellow Mexican coca cola sabor original caps
---
It’s just bulllshit corporate migitaion speak. It’s the whole point of “community managers”, they’re not our friends they are PR goons.
---
So what do we call the Karen of the video game world? This is that.
---
Ok thanks I might be able to join my tv is being used right now
---
What happened? What happened? I’m on vacation rn and missing everything.  But I can tell you the game is fuckin great on Xbox.
---
Oh thanks Dixie. ☺️
---
Sometimes people lie about things they didn’t do for attention. I just don’t see how you could implement this in a fair way. I think it’d be abused and turned into a mess. Not a bad idea tho.
---
It's been worth it though the Santa Tron is so funny too!
---
Except that according to Support they've resolved these issues and have fixed glitches returning items. 
---
They've supposedly also added some form of inventory logging which has allowed them to return characters to prior states. 
---
So again, we know it happened to about 1 out of 1000 of the people who claimed they had it happen and none of us are support, so deal with them maybe instead of on the forums?
---
Yeah. They won't do that. I really doubt they'll even shut down the servers. Server downtime means people not playing, people not buying atoms, people thinking the game's completely unplayable and not getting a subscription.
---
Fml so disappointing.
---
Oh cool did they say that?  If so that goes a long way toward a proper fix.
---
It's so worth it! I'm hoping for the plasma grenade plan!
---
Prepare to be downvoted by the Negatrons!
---
I gave you an upvote for solidarity though !
---
I'll be on until around midnight EST, so no rush.
---
That's why it's a discussion. 
---
I understand it's difficult but something has to be done about having verified VA unverified claims. 
---
Otherwise how is this being a useful tool for people actually wanting to know what is happening with real players in a non-Bethesda owned forum if it's flooded with disinformation?
---
basically hacker made a script that lets them steal from your inventory i had my 3 star explosive excecutioner fixer i cant remember the third perk and along with that my xo1 armor that had the moth man paint and all my 45 for the gun luckily they didnt all my stuff but im still pissed that they stole my prized fixer took me weeks of hoping servers to get it
---
I don’t mind being downvoted, I just thought some positivity would be a nice change. Thank you for the upvote tho.
---
It was made by Battlecry Studio. The people who failed to put out their first game. A game that was subpar enough that Bethesda didn't want it released. So they rebranded them to be Bethesda Austin.   
---
I'm still astonished they haven't shut down the studio, or switched it over to nothing more than a QA and support department like what Bioware did to the idiots who made ME Andromeda.
---
Oh my god, so basically they just walked up, traded with you(without you knowing obvi) and just took whatever they wanted?
---
Holy crap I didn't even notice. Thanks!
---
It was a rant, They are built to make zero sense
---
My Xbox GT is astrosguy. I try to play a little bit every day. 👍

no we must blame the engine for all problems and refute all critical thinking.

lag? engine
---

---
hack? engine

bad story? engine
---
todd howard? engine
---
skyrim 2? engine

cat barfed on your loafers? engine

It's all about positive pr, they can't admit they've got an actual problem. Just look at how long it took to address the duping, and that's still going.
---
people gild all manner of inane posts
---
3hrs late to the party. When i posted there was only the one video i mentioned going around. I saw the one you posted about an hour after I wrote this. Appreciate the effort though. Ty.
---
they don't even have to initiate trade or be even close to you reports are even if you in rendering distance they can get you
---
Holy shit this is fucking incredible.
---
This is what happens when consumers stick their fingers in their ears and defend a company no matter what.
---
Literally everyone should have seen this coming by now.
---
Excuse my language but, holy shit thats actually insane!! I am so sorry to you &amp; everybody else who had this happen to them. My god..
---
But i can open the creation engine and load stuff into my client world, and exchange whatever  client content i like  and use it how i like it :x  recently people even found that out and also could load that change on the servers. no one ever blamed the engine for that lol.  just as u said beth is blamed for that all the time for their poor performance. i dont even think they know how to fix that either and arent allowed to report that to the big bosses or the project gets stomped hahaha
---
So what are you guys going to purchase with the 500 atoms they are going to give?
---
Oh alright! I'll add you astro
---
The engine is fine, there literally is no need for a new engine. BGS fixed the issue, if they could fix it now then it means they always could have. It's on them, not the engine.
---
Nah, they *already* doxed the players via the support system when people were filling tickets for the canvas bag thing and the system started publicly exposing personal information.
---
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
---
Cool! I think my daughter is playing Overwatch right now but I’ll be on in a bit
---
Yes.  VATS cost and accuracy is impacted by the weight of the weapon used.  This is why I try to keep the final weight of my modded weapons under 9 lb's for purposes of VATS.  
---
I just recently shaved some more weight off my Pipe-Bolt and Pipe-Revolver, to 6.3 and 7.2 lb's respectively.  To try and get the equivalent modded traits on a Handmade or a Fixer, you're looking at probably 16-18 lb's.
---
If you don't like Pipe-Guns, and can't afford the legendary weight reduction, I'd highly recommend going plasma sniper, then laser-auto as a backup.
---
Hmm yes I’m sure that a Bethesda employee doing FO76 damage control would be using the same account to troubleshoot issues that they are having with the FO4 DLCs. And clearly you have the eyesight of a sloth, since 174 days and a year are 2 extremely different numbers.
---
I’m not sure I can really support the crux of your argument here though I definitely agree the game suffers overall from a lack of experienced, quality programmers with multiplayer experience.
---
But plenty of games have had clientside issues that dramatically disrupted gameplay. One AAA title that comes to mind is World if Warcraft, that has throughout the years had any number of clientside issues that allowed duping, item hacking, weird and unintended item effects, etc.
---
One of the more infamous involved using a goblin bomb or grenade (it’s been awhile I cannot remember the exact item) during the big boss battle in Wrath of the Lich King to bypass an entire boss mechanic. It’s believe exploiting that one got a whole guild banned.
---
take this meme back and work on it a bit. this is very low effort.
---
I wouldn’t spend penny one on a private server over this shit! If I spend any money it will be to purchase I different game. I have had it with this crap here....
---
I don't know much about this stuff, but surely someone capable of figuring out how to hack like this could get around a hardware ban or use another machine?
---
Obviously I'd like to seem them banned but surely they'd be back 5 minutes later if they wanted to? I think our only hope is Bethesda closing out the exploit
---
Has it been worth it though? Have you got many of the mounted heads? If so, which ones?
---
Public test server $15.99 a week. fallout even firster

If you’re looking to expand your gaming horizons for an unbeatable price, Xbox game pass offers a ton of incredible games for just 10$ a month, even on PC. Might be worth checking out.
---
The "impeachment" is just a joke to everybody.
---
Okie.
---
I would but there is no point, janitor mods gonna delete this anyway.
---
Back to hopeful! Lol
---
New plugin?
---
thanks and trust me that language is mild to what i was saying yesterday when they stole my stuff. Hopefully Bethesda does the right thing and reset effected accounts back to the day before they where stolen from
---
lol. this game has been dog shit since release and people are surprised now? you all will keep playing and keep paying for this manure
---
I hope so to my man, my prayers are with you💓
---
Well if you are both calling me a troll and attacking me, it would be impossible to believe you're a troll.  So that only leaves one option - you're a fanboy.  So effectively I've made no such shit up. You're just pissed because I've called you out for defending this trash game.
---
If you’re looking to expand your gaming horizons for an unbeatable price, Xbox game pass offers a ton of incredible games including AAA titles and not even only first party, they put Devil May Cry 5 on there for just 10$ a month, even on PC. Might be worth checking out.

Honestly I liked the essay thing. Everything else was bad though.

Deny log in from virutal machines, problem solved. 
---
A game I used to moderate on steam does hardware bans and his own anti cheat he wrote denies access to any virtual machine programs.
---
Bethesda has offered a solution to the hacking, get Fallout 1st and you can get a private server
---
I wouldn’t be so quick to say it safe to play yet. What are you basing that on?
---
I actually played and won a couple of solo rounds to help some randos get extra XP :) I'm actually working on making a YouTube channel to teach other players how to win NW. Here's a gameplay video I made a few days ago to show that I'm not talking myself up. 
---
https://youtu.be/542opvmpuD8
---
&gt; Why would I be pissed at someone for taking advantage of something a company purposefully left open to be exploited?
---
For the same reason you would be mad at someone for stealing from your car because it has breakable windows. It's not silly to be mad at that. Though I'm not excusing Bethesda for being behind the ball on securing the platform, it is just a game. I definitely think they're just incompetent in this area, not maliciously cutting corners.
---
I KNOW, completely deserted. No players or camps. I assumed everyone was off the game because of this but even the hacker didn't show up?
---
Yes I'm just missing the SB sbq and moth man mounted and plasma grenade plan it's also worth it in a festive sense I guess I've hand the best luck with large packages and make sure you apply your chemist card for double gifts  and hard bargain cards. Grape mentats are your best friend when buys wrapping paper too!
---
No, this hack is proof private servers should be an included feature, NOT a paid service. 1st needs to be scrapped.
---
This.  So much of this.  
---
As someone who worked in the IT industry, I am always befuddled by folks that talk about code and engines as if they are loaves of bread that have a finite shelf-life.  
---
Good code and good engines can keep going indefinitely.  You don't throw away good code and good engines because they are old.  They don't grow mold or go stale like bananas that hung up in the kitchen too long.  You reinvest into them, refine them, and keep building on them with lessons learned over time.  This lesson has been one that companies have been forced to learn and relearn dev cycle after dev cycle.  But the suits always think it's sexier to start fresh, make something new, and then have to spend years and hundreds of thousands of dollars (often millions) debugging and reinventing the wheel.  
---
So when people piss and moan about the Creation Engine, it's pretty ignorant.  It's not the engine necessarily to blame, it's the lack of investment back into it, the lack of prudent development in the cycle that takes what was learned and applies to refining.
---
Yeah.. What he said.

So you're an American who doesn't know who the Raiders are and what the Raider Nation is? Now I'm starting to wonder... Am i dealing with a troll, a moron, or a child? Time to put down the controller and leave mom's basement for a bit. There are these things called 'stadiums' outside where  tens of thousands of Americans gather every Sunday to watch people called 'athletes' compete in something called 'sports'  Google it.
---
What are whales in this context?
---
The various basic items, wood paneling, bed, ammo, and survival. That's like the film bird box too
---
Bethesda is a magnitude worse than other companies. Six years of WoW and four years of FFXIV generated half as many bug reports from me as my first month of Fallout 76. A year and a half of ESO didn't even come close to the number of bugs in Fallout 76. You don't even have an anecdote to back up your theory that other games have support as poor as Fallout 76.
---
I had honestly been trying to figure out that math as well.
---
Roughly 20% of this sub are accounts and dupe accounts that exist just to crap all over the game.  And you're welcome :)
---
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS RAGE
---
Many many times during this event. You are certainly not alone.
---
 \&gt;  While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected   
---
Oh cut the crap, already. Fix your fucking game. Anti-cheat should have been in day one. So your jobs for once.
---
You're not the only one that has seen this, it seems to be an asset loading issue, change servers or relog and it usually fixes itself.
---
Pro Tip: If you're going to make a joke post like this, you need to go all out. This is just... well, kind of phoned in. That said, it means it matches 76 quite well.
---
??????
---
What does the global population have to do with how many people play a game? Lots and lots of big multiplayer games don't even manage 5K people at a time. 
---
"You honestly think that only 5000 worldwide (with 7.6 billion people) play Anthem on PC?"
---
Stuff like Mordhau is still fairly big, [but has 6K people on at a time](https://steamcharts.com/app/629760), and I'd say there are definitely as many if not more people playing that than Fo76 on PC.  Most of the servers are deserted ghost towns, and you'll see the same names regularly on Fo76, it's not exactly booming
---
Looks like you’re not on PS4, would’ve asked for some help. I’ll try to keep an eye out for your channel
---
Its ok to play this game as long as you’re not SPENDING any money on this game. If you do then you deserve everything you get.
---
Yeah, like... the game is perfect, wtf are they complaining about!?
---
Downvoted for low quality, not subject matter.
---
May your Vault-Tec C.A.M.P. be livable, and your Nuka-Cola nice and chilled this Holiday Season!
---
Pessimism will get you nowhere.
---
oh, sure, to each their own. I just have never seen anybody call a WOW/Diablo hybrid gameplay anything close to an evolution of TES combat, and find it honestly laughable. It's like saying KOTOR 2 combat is an evolution of Dark Souls combat, it just doesn't compute for me. Going from  100% realtime combat which is unique and synonymous with the series to a clone of  SWTOR/WoW skillbar with cooldowns that are in the vast majority of MMOs. Magic use is relegated to staves to adhere to the MMO formula. I just don't understand how any of that can be considered an upgrade.
---
I think there's more than enough blame to go around.
---
That's why you learn from these mistakes and don't repeat them. When I found out that the PC NW hacks relied on client-side authentication of hits and teleporting victims to the hacker so that the hacker's client could provide that authentication... I had no words.
---
There are industry standards and plenty of past lessons to learn from. There's no excuse for this.
---
Ive spent almost 60k across all characters and accounts. Only got 1 Plasma Grenade plan.
---
Janitors are supposed to clean up shit. 
---
This. is. shit.
---
I've always sold em for 85.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
People who complain that F1st is Pay to Win are out there dropping $200 on be Gatling plasmas. Most likely scammed off some poor kid too. No one is safe from karma.
---
Thank you, will do that next time I go on.
---
In theory, yes. That said, this is probably just a temporary lull. I'm expecting the hackers to patch their code and be back to thieving in no time.
---
Why not blame both
---
Hello 20% !
---
Ohhh!   That's the random encounter that is crying to his dead comrades to 'wake up' and that the "Bad Baa Baa went away".  I kind of felt really sorry for the mutant.
---
I mean yeah u are right WoW had problems with like this in the past but they were mostly bugs and not hacks. Like the goblin bomb you mentioned no one wrote code for this item to be exploited or anything it was simply a bug in the game. Also Blizzard fixes those bugs normaly in a pretty short amount of time and the players using this exploits always get punished. Bethesda doesn't give a damn Bethesda never bothered fixing their games....
---
What's the weak stomach worry?
---
You do realize that this is an altered and "updated" version of *the Morrowind engine*, yes? Trust me, they need a new engine.
---
then they figure out how to resteal back the weapons they sold just to sell you another
---
Yep, I'm on Xbox, but if enough people have interest in the channel (once I announce it), I'll do a step-by-step guide to win NW.
---
You're very welcome.  I hope you find something that suits you and have fun blazing away in combat with it!
---
Yeah - that's a random encounter with the PTSD mutant (Post Traumatic Sheep Disorder)
---
We should just refer to Bethesda as vault tech from now on. Seems like some shit they would do
---
So you think the countless issues 76 has had is within a normal scale? Idk any game that has had the number of issues 76 has and so consistently. I get the annoyance of non players piling on but lets not lose sight of the glaring issues which more than 1 have been MAJOR issues.
---
&gt;A lot of people here seem to just be here to cause Drama.
---
Not like you, right pal?
---
I think I just struggle with aiming, it’s atrocious in this game. But a guide with more than just the basics will definitely help me
---
I'm just sticking around to see if Wastelanders is any good, and I'm only doing that much because I already bought the game and can't get a refund; might as well see what I can salvage from this.
---
People gild bots, welcome to reddit.

People who don't mind dropping as much cash as it takes to buy all the latest atom store items, Fallout 1st, etc.  There's not a ton to buy that would burn a lot of cash outside PA skins, except maybe repair and scrap kits.  But if enough people are willing to drop $20 or $30 most months, it adds up.
---
Looks like you had a bad day, did you had your inventory wiped too? Don't worry, maybe bethesda will get your shit back in 2 months
---
Blaming "the engine" is basically showing that you don't know what an engine is and don't understand the issue.
---
Starting the countdown to the updated hack... now!
---
That would require Bethesda to be nice.
---
Brand devotion and brand advocates are the holy grail of PR and Marketing. 
---
They are absolutely more effective than paid shills. Companies have spent decades trying to engineer these brainwashed tools, and it’s worked.
---
Thanks for your reply. Is whales a common term for people who spend a lot on online games, or is it specific to FO76? I’ve never heard it before.
---
Yeah, none

Bethesda: creates bad game
---
Youtubers: cover exploits 
---
Fanboys: stop shitposting youtubers, reeeee
---
'Tis the latter, indeed- by highlighting an example of a team in a much worse situation being able to take note of a similar problem and amend it reasonably efficiently, it is intended to show that what has happened to F76 is honestly pretty ridiculous. 
---
I just normally tend to mention extenuating circumstances at the end of an argument so that people on the opposite side can look at the argument without feeling opposed, and make a decision more objectively. Usually I'm reasonably clear but in this case I may have been too obtuse, alas.
---
Spend 20 minutes and just watch this.
---
Bethesda is following the mobile model of creeping "social pressure" to monetize their games, and doing everything they can to minimize costs at the expense of a quality product. Just watch it.

\*When it takes you a long time to repsond, then you define the 500+ people affected as   "A small number"\*
---
lol this didn’t age well.
---
No. Was at work....as I stated. Even if I had...guess what? Just a game bud, wouldn't have come to cry and yell or even worse make some *shitty fucking joke*. I did come to see the state of things out of curiosity. Here we are.
---
You have to pay $9.99 US( or more depending on where you live) per month.
---
Why hire an expert when you can hire an intern for less than a third the cost?
---
&gt; I've sunk over £200 into this fucking mess since release 
---
Are you familiar with the phrase "Throwing good money after bad"?
---
Reminder EA has five times updated a game and made it un playable two of said games is still broken for console users. bilizard has destroyed WoW several times with updates a few almost killing the game and they are slow to fix those problems.  
---
Ubisoft have broken a game so badly with an update in the past they had to use a crack to fix it, and they are not the first to do that.  
---
compared to other company's Bethesda's bugs are minor.
---
Also do you have any screws I can buy
---
It didn’t age at all. It was an opinion formed 6 hours ago. I was wrong. Happy?
---
Lmao, you guys don't know when to give up right? Just accept this is a shitty game and go back to fallout 4. Stop feeding this hungry lying, money grabbing machine once and for all.
---
Ran into this at Wacky Willard’s the other night.  Took a picture of me standing behind headless scorched in my Mothman mask, not the best but makes me laugh
---
Has bethesda ever broken a game So badly that it required a pirated crack to fix? Ubisoft and one other company have done that.   
---
No bethesda is not worse then other company's they are annoying at the most and slow to react but no where near the worst.
---
Yes it always makes me happy when people who come into this sub just to hate on the game are proven wrong.
---
Ask and ye shall receive!
---
So tell me how many global PC Fallout players there are.
---
Going to reply to your comment thread so the other guy doesn't get notifications. Yes, I have screws
---
You clearly haven’t read half my posts lmao. I don’t enjoy the game like you do, but I do support it. It needs work for sure, but I have no faith in Bethesda actually doing any of it. So make sure you’re aware of exactly what I hate before accusing me :-)
---
And what has optimism gotten us thus far?
---
Well, I appreciate your explanation, and amazing word structure. That cleared things up for me quickly and fully agree with you. Happy holidays :)
---
What makes Bethesda distant third in the blame olympics? We all know broken people exist, which is why we lock our doors. Bethesda failed to lock theirs even when they were housing other people's stuff. A burglar is still a burglar, but nobody is going to look at Bethesda and be like "Yup, sufficient security.". I would be angrier at Bethesda for not looking after my stuff. There simply is no way to eradicate bad behavior from the population, which is why we still need to protect our valuables. Criminals still need to be prosecuted, but companies that create these kinds of situations through their incompetence must be put on a blast as well.
---
You know what's a more shitty fucking joke? Playing this game
---
I'm having fun
---
We play just to piss you off.
---
&gt;Excuse my language
---
Your too wholesome for the internet, leave while you still can
---
From a completely technical standpoint, they're not lying. It sold 1.4 million copies just by then end of 2018. Regardless of how many are still playing, 500, even 1,000 is a small number when the total number is over 1 million. I'm not defending it, just clarifying because they're not technically wrong when they say a "small number". Of course that number isn't just PC but split across all devices but that is the number from 1 year ago and I imagine they've made more sales since then. So even if the PC playerbase is 300,000 total, 1,000 is still a "small number".
---
Some corrections:  
---
Square-Enix didn't take the servers down. They rebuilt the entire game from the ground, up. While also keeping the original 1.0 servers going, and continuing to support said 1.0 servers with story content (for free) that related to the relaunching of the game. The final cutscene of 1.0 is the first half of the intro movie to A Realm Reborn (aka 2.0). Then they apologized multiple times, and even gave veteran players unique items including a special tattoo to mark them as veterans of the calamity.  
---
I'll be utterly amazed if anyone from Bethesda even apologizes. Let alone put forth the sheer effort and money to rebuild the game. It's not even a matter of if they would, but more so if they could. This developer is simply not competent enough.
---
Why the f would you still make this comment?
---
I wouldn’t say perfect.. lol
---
Your statement is ignorant on so many levels. You start with a stupid assumption about the quality of the meat. I ate quite a bit of it, it was all great. Have less children? Once you have them that's not really an option... Its not like you can return them. 'Healthy home made food from ingredients'.... is that even a complete sentence? Everything in every grocery store is 'from ingredients' Bacon-wrapped Filet Mignon only has two ingredients, bacon &amp; a great cut of steak add a side of vegetables and a glass of milk or and that IS healthy nutrient dense homemade food. The tri-tip and the chicken breasts were great too.

😁
---
Somewhat common particularly when talking about mobile pay-to-win (and other) games.  
---
It originates in Vegas (or other gambling areas), and it was coined to describe people who would drop in more or less regularly and drop (or win, but usually drop) hundreds of thousands of dollars on a whim.  Kind of like high rollers, but more prone to bet *very* large amounts of money in relatively short periods.
---
Console or pc?
---
a few people ? there's at least 530+ players that got robbed in this video and you call this a FEW ? thank god i got eso and fo76 for free the only thing i ever bought from bethesda is fallout 3 and i feel so relieved that i haven't spent a single cent on the atomic shop or the eso shop
---
china has been reformed and opened for30years。The cold war had also been ended for 30years。Fo76 is just a game 。Even you can find chinese players in battlefiled4.
---
Seriously?
---
Amen to that. FFXIV makes this game look like a Russian meme-filled asset flip.
---
Thanks
---
A positive outlook?
---
THIS Kid Is Dumb ^^ Nice try dude
---
Even if they spent the money, they are also too incompetent to pull it off.
---
Nah, i'm just here to mock at you idiots.
---
I am surprised anyone is still playing FO76 at this point, this should solidify exactly why you shouldn't be playing: Bethesda doesn't care about you. They could have fixed this days ago, but chose not to.
---
https://steamcharts.com/search/?q=fallout
---
Fallout 1st is a subscription service, its not a new practice in online games
---
Are people's atom shop items really being stolen though? Iike not being able to get them back. Everything in this game is a cosmetic in terms of skins for weapons or armor, you may actually lose the weapon or armor piece but your not losing the ability to create said skin.
---
I got that and three tomahawk plans without spending on wrapping paper.
---
Shows how long its been since I played online
---
As a server programmer you should know it is hard to distinguish incompetent devs from competent devs working under incompetent management.
---
Remember that the netcode was handled by BGS Austin, which was previously Battlecry studios (a studio that worked on an eventually-aborted multiplayer game for several years). Battlecry had a team of fairly experienced multiplayer guys working there - if you poke around the Fallout 76 credits (https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fallout-76/credits) you'll see a number of people with credits on multiplayer titles, most notably Star Wars: The Old Republic.
---
Now, I have no way of knowing if "worked on previously not-terrible multiplayer games" is an adequate way of telling if these devs are competent or not. But Bethesda doesn't exactly have a great record for engineering excellence (e.g. a lot of bugs in 76 - small examples would be the never ending audio glitch and the lever action reload issue - were present in Fallout 4 but didn't get fixed between releases), so my personal theory is that this is a case of good devs working under crappy management.
---
It's a very easy story to tell: they were told to take Fallout 4 and slap on some netcode to make a multiplayer prototype. Since it was just a prototype they cut corners, since they were just trying to show it could be done and expected they'd have time and manpower to build up the server side later. Then management probably saw the working prototype and said "great, you're shipping in 18 months, and we're not letting you hire many more people since we want to staff up in areas that will be useful for Starfield".
---
I read the forum the script is posted in. The hack has been around for months, was used sparingly and kept relatively quiet. The guy who decided to make it public, did so to bring it to everyone's attention and cause a wave of response to get it fixed. Unfortunately that wave came in the form of people maliciously using it for gain. It's been around for a while, as I hate to see it used at all I am glad it's getting addressed finally. 
---
Everyone keep in mind, FO4 was built to test for FO76, and the team behind 76 isn't even Bethesda's A-team. They are a smaller group out of Texas, and the time was picked when Bethesda goes on Holiday for maximum effect it looks like.
---
Not a kid, nor am I dumb.  Half of his posts on the sub are complaints about the game.  Not nice to call people names just because you disagree with them.
---
I don’t mind all the problems either. Then again, I’m not someone who lives to play video games - it’s just something fun to do in my spare time.
---
Oh how sad. Your life is so sad and boring you have to reeee to people who like a game which you hate. I pray for you.
---
"A few" " a small number...". I love the way they try to downplay the chaos
---
Yeah no doubt. Hope you have a change of heart some day little dude.
---
It has not been a very popular feature. I have it, its worth the price but its still a crappy idea
---
Exactly. I have a toddler so any video games I play are short timed, and only to have some me time and enjoy a game with friends.
---
Lol. Your life is so sad you have to feed a company who robs you constantly so you can have a virtual life.
---
People can still hack to give you items, so be thankful that you don't have even MORE shit in your misc tab my guy
---
Thanks!
---
Could you DM me a discord invite?
---
Sooo many caps. 100k+?  Has to be at least that.  Only things I'm looking for are some Sturdy and Heavy Raider plans at this point.
---
Not nice just to call people haters because they don’t agree with you lmao
---
They already patched the hack my guy lol. But people can still put stuff in your inventory
---
I'm a huge fallout fan. I obviously didn't think things would be as bad as they where, I assumed the plan was to patch in larger camp budget, more storage and create a more social settlement system overtime eventually tweaking the game to an enjoyable level. Todd said in interviews many times they where "still dialing those".
---
The game was open to change and I thought Bethesda would tweak the bad and as they went along. Doesn't look likely and I'd rather they finish up and allow the community to step in
---
Yeah it is sad, isn't it? Go play your pay to win game.
---
Hey, I'm not even here to disagree with the state of the game.
---
But your joke was shit. Far shittier than people enjoying this game. 
---
To each their own. Some want to play 76. You want to make utterly shit jokes. Its okay, I guess.
---
These idiots should be prosecuted. They're still laughing about it, I'm sure, and they think they'll get away with it scot-free. They deserve to be punished, by the fullest extent of the law.
---
cause they brainlets lmfao  😂😂😂
---
it is sure that a little chinese play fo76，i estimate about 500 chinese players。the reason why so little players，because the mobile phone games and moba games are much more popular in china。
---
Ah, Bethesda. The company that cheaped out on canvas bags, poor quality Fallout swag, and spent an "immense" amount of time and, effort and money to create a "quality" game.
---
At the end of the day, these hackers will not cost Bethesda any money. Worst case scenario, a few people stop playing. They won't lose their whales.
---
Best case scenario, said whales re-purchase their looted items, giving Bethesda more money.
---
Given their history, there is almost zero probability that Bethesda would invest time, effort, or most importantly, MONEY, into trying to track down and prosecute the hackers. You're fighting a battle thats already been lost. You should focus your malice at Bethesda for designing the game in such a way that this could happen in the first place.
---
They all get to hide behind the holidays for now.
---
Yes I'm aware. I don't think a new engine will make anything better but worse.
---
BGS knows this engine and it works well. Fallout 4 actually had way less glitches than FO3, FNV and Skyrim at launch. 76 had so many because they went into unfamiliar territory, if that make a completely new engine, we can expect another 76 launch glitches wise.
---
The engine isn't going to solve the problems they have. What will solve the problems is them going back to their roots. Single Player Open World RPG that allow mods. Lots of choice, interesting story and side quests and a nice amount of unique weapons and armor.
---
Changing the engine won't solve any of that but honestly could take away from it as they'd have to spend more time on getting the new engine to work.
---
I said you come to the sub to hate on the game.  Don’t twist my words.
---
Not a lot of people online, I just tried to avoid other people and didn’t have anything stolen 🤷‍♂️ I think there was only 4 other players on the server I was in 🤷‍♂️
---
Mind sending an invite my way in DMs?
---
Really? All of my content is simply hate? No suggestions for improvements or content solely meant for laughs? Nothing about the market trades either? I’m solely here to hate on the game aren’t I?
---
Im sorry but all that info was wrong. It isnt based off of weight in 76 like previous games. 
---
Only the mods effect ap. All aligned mods, full auto mods, faster reload magazines, and reflex sights will lower ap cost. My handmade with 25% less vats cost costs 0 ap per shot and weighs 20 pounds
---

---
Bethesda patched something during unscheduled downtime today.  I think the assumption is that it was about the exploit, but I don't think they've actually commented either way.
---
Small number in comparison to the number of active players.
---
I wonder if you really think you're doing good by playing this. I mean, you having fun is enough to support Bethesda? Real question. But anyway, go have fun.
---
I think that would only work if the character can't be transferable to online mode. There would just be so many opportunities for someone to alter the game and inventory unchecked, then bringing all of that in online mode.
---
Corrrreeeccttttt.
---
Sure will friend! At least Im having fun rather than whining and thinking anyone gives a shit.
---
First thing you want to do with aim is to go into your settings and crank up both of the sensitivity settings at least 3 notches. The default sensitivities are too sluggish for combat. It takes some getting used to, but force yourself to adjust to it. After a while, you won't even notice the difference.
---
The way I taught myself how to aim was to use only a semi-automatic pistol (one bullet per trigger pull instead of automatic, which fires continuously as long as the trigger is held). This forces you to learn how to get a shot on target. Do not use VATS. Shots to the torso are easiest. Once you can get 85%+ of your shots on target with manual aim, you can switch to automatic weapons and rifles.
---
I have the Wasteland Camo set, which looks a lot like the classic 'chocolate chip' desert camo.  I love that pattern, so I snagged it over the Woodland Camo, which might actually make more sense for the green parts of Appalachia.  
---
The Winter Wonderland Camo is pretty stylish though, and even though we don't have snow, it works for Urban Camo too.  I guess it depends?  I mean, no one is really going to be fooled by the camo ingame, but it is nice to blend in sort-of.  
---
I dunno if I like the look of the Free State PA skins.  They look too...  I dunno.  Something about just doesn't seem right.   Maybe they don't have enough rust and Bondo to look truly Appalachian?
---
Ok, then. Enjoy your stuff being stolen and weeks and weeks of crying to bethesda support. That's really fun!
---
In my opinion, revolutionary paint is the coolest looking.
---
This happened to me earlier this morning. I'm done with this broke ass product. I'm still mad about it so maybe I'm not thinking with the right mind but I feel foolish for the time/money I put into FO76 as it's been racked with problems since launch. When are they gonna do something to make up for all the problems--instead of bs free atomic shop items that always pale im comparison to the paid stuff.
---
I'd be curious to know what kind of jokes you consider funny, probably none, you fallout 76 players have a fucking IQ of 20 to understand anything anyway
---
And don’t forget that the usually talkative Pete Hines took a year off from Twitter after 76 was released
---
U can lock it so they can’t without getting wanted
---
No where near 500+ in that video.
---
Then don't play. Move on. Find something else to occupy your time and attention. I don't subscribe to subreddits of games I don't play. No rational person does.
---
To be honest I only glossed over your post history and noticed a few complaint posts.  A lot of people on this sub only come here to constantly hate on the game.  Apologies if my assumptions were wrong.
---
Oof! Bullet dodged I guess. Was hoping someone would just hit take all and I'd be free of these bombs and other useless junk!
---
Posting a warning message in the launcher and leaving the servers open and shutting them down when they actually have a fix seems more like how most businesses would address something like this. Compensating those who were actually affected by it with something would be a great idea from a customer service perspective and would be more than reasonable. Expecting something to be given free to EVERYONE including those who were unaffected like the OP is suggesting is childish and ridiculous.
---
It’s funny isn’t it? How they point and laugh saying “broke boys” when they will be the same people to say “PC is too much money”
---
With Camo you think you'll be able to blend in but really everyone can hear the sound of your ass cheeks clapping because your power armor is so dummy thicc
---
welcome to our little enclave 
---
————by modus
---
i am really curious why your think i am not from that enclave？because my english level is a mess？
---
Sure
---
But they were told about this before hand and they ignored it. Now it's a problem and they have to fix it now but likely won't cause they don't know how. lol Other wise they would of fixed it before instead of updating the atom shop so much. Bethesda's modding community know their game more than they do. It's obvious given how many games the community has patched rather than Bethesda patching it themselves.
---
And the games industry is doing everything they can to argue that these in-game items DON'T have monetary value
---
Sorry bud, Im on console. I dont have worry about it! Now you could go back to your corner and fap to how much you hate this game. Oh by the way, merry christmas!
---
Idk Bethesda seems to be able to patch these hacks quicker than they fix their own bugs, makes me think the hackers aren't v competent
---
Get your shit together bethesda.
---
May your lights not short on your aluminum tree! Merry Christmas!
---
Not true. Codes and Engine eventually get replaced by new ones. It’s constantly changing, nothing last forever. I got nothing against Creation Engine but it have lots of flaws and Can Not keeps up with the demand. You can try to improve it and optimize but eventually it will hit dead end and then it’s time to move on to the next Engine. Instead they have wasted time and money on a engine that is past it expiration date.
---
It’s fine. Just please don’t jump to conclusions about people. I get this game gets a lot of hate, but we aren’t all negative to try and ruin it. We want to see it succeed and do our best to voice our concerns when able. I don’t mind the game. Its not my favorite but it can be fun. But I can not stand Bethesda anymore with how they handle issues. So I do understand just how negative my comments may come across
---
The writing has been on the wall for a long time now, that people are even playing this absolutely garbage game either shows their ignorance or just having no self-respect. If you did any kind of research of this game you should have known to begin with this was going to be a "wait and see" game at best, and the disasters just kept piling on and on afterward both in the marketing AND the actual online gameplay.   
---
What are you people even still doing here? If anything you should be trying to get your money back because this game barely functions as it is. They have cheated you!
---
I find your posts failure hilarious. 
---
Again, fully ignoring the state of the game or this shameful recent fuck up. I'm not coming to defend BGS. I just want you to honestly try harder. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.
---
You're right he should have put it on the scrap box.
---
um..what's the problem? or i should say this specific one lol i haven't played in a bit now
---
I can’t speak for the OP, but for me, even as a real casual, play for fun kinda person... not being able to continue quests/goals I was working on, etc, without having to jump through hoops, play naked, to keep the gear I worked for safe, because of a major bug on their end? No thanks, I play for fun but that ain’t it in my book.
---
True, but we should also ask ourselves "why is the game vulnerable to this since launch?" I would say it's because of poor Bethesda decisions even before the game was released 😔
---
There's no real argument for damages.
---
Bethesda received payment for said items. The items aren't destroyed, no real money has been lost, and according to the EULA, you as a user do not own the items. So you're in a bit of a catch-22.
---
Either the EULA stands (which some say has had "limited" success in the USA, but that is untrue, a EULA has NEVER stood up to scrutiny in court), and the hackers are in violation of it in such a way that makes them suspect to legal action, or the EULA does not stand, and you "own" the items rather than being licensed for them. If that's the case, each individual that had them stolen will need to take legal action.
---
 There's also the fact that many countries permit modification of a users software once it has been purchased, and as the game is built in such a way that these things are handled on the client side, they won't be in violation of "hacking" in a way that can be prosecuted, as they are not inserting themselves into Bethesda's servers. This is all handled on the client's end.
---
Lastly, you need to look at Bethesda's cost/benefit analysis. They lose NOTHING by simply running a patch and getting on with it. They DO, however, lose time, money, and a potentially industry crippling precedent if they take legal action, it gets to court, and the hackers win. They won't prosecute them. Ever.
---
Instead, direct your anger at Bethesda for coding their product in such a way that allowed this to happen in the first place.
---
Pretty sure there aren't even several thousand 76 players across all platforms together...lol.
---
I googled sports got porn
---
*remove Fallout First entirely as a Christmas bobus
---
Compare response time and see the pattern:
---
Vault Raids deleting inventory: 2 weeks to fix
---
Losing all junk to F1st: 1 week to fix
---
5 star legendaries being hacked in: three days to fix
---
Inventory theft hack: 1 day to fix
---
Either these hackers are shitty or Bethesda is getting better about fixing issues, and I don't think it's the second one, wouldn't you agree?
---
hey ，whether or not，some of my friend still find some hacker are work .it not safe in the game .every one should play in private world
---
Not worth putting more effort like I said, janitors had already deleted this post within 5 minutes.
---
Some no lives hacked the pc version of the game so they could steal people's inventories including armor and weapons. Bethesda was silent for a while but have made a statement and even fixed the hack already so good on them for stepping up this time.
---
If I was a PC player (I do use my computer to play games, but the PS4 is my main source of gaming today) I would choose one of my characters, dump his good items into Another character and use easily replaceable items on the first one, knowing everything can just vanish in the air.
---
What do you expect from apologists?
---
Yeah the reloading bugs are really awful and need to be fixed client side.
---
However, in the situation where you can have 128 clip size on a hunting rifle, or 500 on a laser rifle, etc, server validation is needed to rectify the issue.
---
I am not sure if this is correct but like the one said do not play, Bethesda might decide the best way to give your back your stuff is rollback your account to a previous state when you had your things. So while you may get your stuff back, any progress or things you acquired since you lost your things will be lost. Best bet, do not play and send in a support ticket. Best of luck
---
that's probably the best one for a fixer or handmade, yeah.
---
15k deep? Try 75k deep. I have problems :(
---
LMFAO! Imagine smoking again because of fallout 76 hahhahahahahahahhahahahahahaha
---
I emptied everything of main value off and started using items I never normally do, like a BSSS Pipe Wrench. Surprisingly effective
---
I'm more than willing to entertain the possibility that my information is out of date, but to my experience, it seems to have held true...  when I select and mod weapons for VATS, there's a definite and noticeable pattern for going lighter reducing VATS costs.  If you can show me how the Nuka Crypt code decrypter data works, I'd be very interested in seeing how it compares to what I've experienced.
---
Hahah everyone made me feel cheep I bought 2 more large gift wraps since posting this thread
---
This isn't how it works. At all.
---
In the video you can count ~40 people being stripped and the video itself contains a *claim* to have hit 532 people in total over the course of one night.
---
This is just 1 person who posted a video of a *publicly available hack*.
---
ok glad to know
---
thanks
---
Just take your upvotes dammit
---
It's true!  The hackers even deleted my stash, too.... and I don't even have the game installed!  Or purchased.
---
I mean, that's cool and all, but it still has nothing to do with the question you yourself proposed.
---
support has also claimed things in the past that were verifiably false. I'd take anything they say as a grain of salt. so far they only bothered to restore entire characters, as far as I know.
---
Most of those players are more than likely max capped traders. 15k is a respectable amount. Remember, Whitesprings and its station has a total of 7 papers you can buy at once
---
Don’t fall behind. Gamertag “Digital Press”.
---
I don't celebrate christmas but thanks!
---
 Now Bethesda is paying the ultimate price for their cumbersome live service. All the great players / modders / programmers / people from the community who used to fix and improve upon Bethesda's shitty bugs, glitches, performance Issues, UI problems, and all other annoyances in their past games time and time again over the years now obviously know the engine in and out perfectly, even better than the devs themselves. And not being allowed to mod or fix anything as they did in all the games and years before, they ultimately turn against the devs and the game, maybe for the best of the community in the long run, but really Beth needs to wake up NOW. This COULD really well be the end of F76 if the hacks get rampant. Just imagine someone or a mass of people having invested a lot of time and money into the game and gets stripped naked ingame by one of these hack(er)s. They will NEVER EVER return to the game, having to start from scratch if Beth does not resolve or prevent this FAST.
---
Where'd you find it that cheap? I can only find it for $16
---
FO76 is not an MMO.
---
Stuff like this encounter really makes me hope that there will be a mutant settlement in wastelanders
---
One of the bastards i caught doing shady shit 3 different times. They rather censor me than let people see who tf he is though, or ban the guy.

I'm not sure if you're intentionally missing the point or not, but it's much simpler than all that. A hacker just breached their EULA by modifying and exploiting game files in a way that gave the company a bad reputation. The company can sue them for damages in lost revenue and reputation from whatever they would have expected to receive had this hack not happened. Player counts are down, atom shop purchases will likely be down, there are youtubers and game journalists reporting on this. This is all tangible evidence that could easily be used in a court. The only determining factors would be whether they are willing to go through with it, and whether the hacker is in a country whose jurisdiction would let them take blame for it
---
That’s pretty funny.
---
&lt;insert crying laughter emoji here&gt;
---
Am I able to pick up the antlers?
---
Yeah, like remember when Unreal Engine came out 21 years ago, back in 1998? No one would EVER use that outdated piece of junk today... Wait, hold up. It looks like Unreal is a decade older than the Creation Engine and it's still VERY much in use today.
---
This is exactly what the OP is talking about. You don't understand what a game engine is, so your comment is nonsensical. Windows is an operating system. It's changed quite a bit since Windows 3, but like a game engine, an operating system grows and evolves. The Creation Engine in 76 is a newer version than the Creation Engine in Fallout 4. They aren't using the same, original Creation Engine that they were using 11 years ago.
---
I say let people using these exploits remain in the game, however, they are followed CONSTANTLY by a extremely horny Deathclaw that just wants to give them tickles and if it gets a hold of them furiously humps them till they die.
---
It then takes their gear, and returns at a random time point after they recover to start it again.
---
New Fallout 76 Hack.

Get kicked in the crouch when you try and have fun.

Next Hack Update:
---
When you are on the ground holding your privates, your wallet gets stolen.
---
Well to each their own! Happy holidays!
---
It's similar to a dysfunctional relationship. The game doesn't seem to "love" you back as much as you "love" the game
---
Most of my characters keep White Knight on 24/7. It really works.
---
I agree. My B33/25 Combat rifle weighs 20 lbs and uses 1 ap point per shot in vats.
---
I think if the developers were running the show with little management interference, we wouldn't be here.
---
I'm  with you. I have loved Obsidian and Bethesda to no end with the fallout series. Defended and accepted their unpolished product (all fallouts are unstable, but its a beautiful world full of wonderful narratives and its wacky content is what saves it) until they started the subscription service. I can't defend them now. It makes me sad, but I will always be sceptical with them now :(
---
That very sad but a good point 🧐
---
Can an argument be made? Sure.
---
Would that argument be successful? Doubtful.
---
Again, EULA's don't hold up in court. The cost of a suit would most probably be higher than real revenue, versus "projected" revenue that you are hinging this case upon. Also, most countries, again, have laws that protect the consumers modification of client side software, which this hack utilizes because of Bethesda's poor software design. And lastly, a loss in this kind of suit would not just be devastating for Bethesda, not just for the gaming industry, but the entire software industry. And it's not going to be worth it.
---
So, you can sit here and argue the validity of a lawsuit until your fingertips bleed, but there are far too many factors AGAINST Bethesda taking action. And it's their fault in the first place, as they used an antiquated engine that they knew was not only vulnerable, but open to modification from the start. So they are either willfully ignoring that they KNEW this would happen, or they are woefully incompetent.
---
Either way, stop giving them your money, stop defending them, and stop pretending that they are a smaller bad guy than those that altered software they are most likely legally permitted to alter.
---
True I like to trade some times but have only hit max caps a handful of times. I like the consumerism/ festivity of it it and the cool mounted plans not to me too the icicles lights are worth hunting in my opinion
---
Starting a new character is the safest bet right now as I've heard reports of them being able to access the private servers too!
---
I uninstalled a long while ago, mainly when they banned those bug reporters, because a hunch told me shit would get fucking real quite soon after.
---
Oooooooo boy called that one.
---
Lol that would freak people out
---
Sure! Come to my camp and it's yours. Gamertag is: Oliver Klohzof
---
Apparently there's still a hack that allows people to steal stuff from others stashes but it's more complex
---
Nah the comp will be something like 1 free atom shop item
---
I found the lack of factions(specifically brotherhood) very disturbing when I first played, and it made me want to play fo4
---
Pretty sure Bethesda wasn't the one who logged in explicitly to use a hack they knew would maliciously hurt other players. 
---
Gtfoh with your self righteous pedestal.
---
They can take everything, but some are picky and just take some things!
---
Fair enough. I could see myself making the same mistake if I were less stingy.
---
Hi everyone,
---
We are sorry you are aren't happy with the experience, The game shown is a prototype and was too expensive to fix exploits.
---
We aren't planning on doing anything about it.
---
Get Fucked,
---
God Howard
---
 Bethesda Scam Team
---
Which is exactly why we need the forums here. They are meant to be impartial and defend the players and expose what is really happening but how are they going to do that if the posts are illegitimate.
---
Maybe we'll get 500 Atoms for our trouble
---
Hahaha Ha Hahaha fuuuuunny
---
People still play this. That's more surprising than the hack
---
Light wood laminate
---
Sell this game and buy falloit 4
---
Or
---
Pay 100.00 a year for a private server.  Dead serious
---
**# 16 times**
---
the bugs
---
Correct
---
It was a gift. And damn, I dont get charging for private
---
I imagine after a while, folks will get fed up with this and just not log in anymore, leaving only the hackers, stealing from each other.  
---
That might be amusing to watch if there were a spectator mode.
---
if you left already you aren't a fan anyway. be gone. stay gone. dont need more complainers in the game anyway.
---
I'm still hoping modders might be able to port the map, unique items, and quests into the Fallout 4 engine. I think that's as close to a single player 76 as we'll get, though.
---
Yep. Well said
---
lol ok I know thats a dis and as a fanboi I should attack, but that shit was funny lol.
---
That's..... not really an argument?
---
They haven't broken any laws as far as I can tell. Are the hackers assholes? Hell yeah they are.
---
But they're using client side modifications that exploit a weakness in Bethesda's poor software design. Believe it or not, in most cases, that distinction is going to protect them from any sort of legal recourse. There's also the issue that the game runs P2P, not on "dedicated servers" as they'd lead you to believe. It makes sense from Bethesda's end to do this. It's cheaper. Because of that, these hackers aren't influencing any of Bethesda's assets.
---
You can be as salty as you'd like, but you need to direct your anger at the correct target, and it isn't the hackers.
---
Although I may not play the game anymore, that doesn't lessen the admiration I have for the dedication of those who still do, despite the seemingly never-ending issues.
---
If you actually played with a team, you’d know why that’s not a great idea. The game is meant to be played with others.
---
1st amendment
---
currently they have added no new emotes or icons, the last variant of the ranger armor was the advanced variant, no new helmet. the TENT got it's first new skin (but that only is usable as long as you are a first-er)
---
I am still grinding for my Mr. Fuzzy suit!
---
The way I see it, not everyone likes the same things. And people change and grow out of things all the time. One day someone might love the game, and next day they just aren’t feeling it anymore. And that’s ok! As long as everyone is having fun
---
I mean, it would have been safe to assume that they wouldn't have done anything or would have failed to, loot at the most recent update where they broke legendary items :/
---
ESO wasn't Bethesda and I'm not counting the mobile game.
---
In fact, "The first multiplayer Elder Scrolls game by Bethesda Game Studios" will be the talking point at all the presentations and interviews.
---
76 isnt hard to exceed in everyway. Even the indie games which one can safely assume have a way bigger budget than 76 exceed it in every way. Even Shenmue exceeds it and obviously Outer Worlds.
---
Bar is set extremely low w/ 76.
---
How many tokens do you need?
---
Just when I was finally going to give this game a try tomorrow, oh well.
---
lol so many times after running silos over and over i have walked in and just shot the first robot I see out of reflex.. lol "damnit!"
---
Freedom of speech has limitations. That whole "screaming fire in a theater" thing. 
---
Second, freedom and f speech doesn't come with being absolved from being held accountable for that speech.
---
ZeniMax will just sell them, Arkane and id off to Activision, EA or Epic.
---
There have been a lot of updates that broke legendary items. I mean that they had a full week where the hacker was bragging on discord and talking to youtubers about it, and had seemingly nothing in place to even prepare for it
---
First and foremost, you should probably do a quick YouTube search for what is included in a Fallout 1st subscription. This will give you a visual representation of everything, period.
---
Off hand, you get the ranger armour that's edited to have localized decals on in. You get the Elite ranger armour, two dance emotes (a robot esque one and another "Creepy" one), access to the Scrap Box (lets you store unlimited scrap separate from your stash), a temporary but separate tent/camp, and a few icons.
---
 The move casino and the card cheat scene comes to mind
---
Sunk cost fallacy plagues the whole community
---
No because this games engine is fucking 20+ years old and instead of investing the resources into a proper engine they keep wanting to jerry rig this old piece of shit.
---
“I’m your Huckleberry”
---
No Fanboy here.
---
Just not a defender of the invasiveness and immaturity of hackers and their false delusions of grandeur. 
---
Bethesda has my money.  I have their product.  I don't feel like they owe me anything, nor do I harbour them (and certainly not the honest players of a video game) any harm done by morons with keyboards lashed to their groins, that do nothing productive with their shallow excuses of lives.
---
Wich is cool, but ''hardcore gamers'' tend to be the most vocal part of any community. Casuals are not that invested in the game, they have things to do. 
---
But now think about it this way, you have formed a guild/community, you have farmed items for months, this game is a hobby, like many MMO's lite-MMO's tend to be. A hacker can destroy that in seconds. Bless Online died in 2 weeks because of a dupe exploit, for example.
---
Probably thousands now if one guy did 500
---
I dont want no trouble stranger
---
Git gud broski
---
The count drastically drops w/ each shenanigans since the major drop on release.
---
At this point, 3 outta 5 people dropping aint even drastic.
---
Now of they were whales...
---
You should know the old saying,  Fast, Cheap, Quality - pick any 2
---
SAD!
---
Bethesda admitting in the post by saying “if this happened to you contact us” means they have NO CLUE how many people this affected. 
---
And they also admit in the same post they have no way to give you back what you lost, and are still thinking of what to give those who lost everything.
---
It's not about getting good. They have bloodied explosive laser rifles which split beams that can snipe your out of existence without them even loading into your vision. How's a man apost to fight that
---
Because it's hilarious watching noobs get rekt when they accidentally trigger them.
---
You're no daisy...
---
I’m lvl 160 and I run junkies heavies... What kind of a fight are you looking for?
---
I'll give 76 one thing: Jim used it to make me appreciate something about Pokemon Sword/Shield.
---
Actually the courts at least in the US and much of Asia have ruled that theft of digital goods is also a crime. 
---
Plus the moment they stole atomic shop items it also became more traditional theft as well. 
---
In all seriousness though, how are you sitting here taking the side of the hackers? 
---
I get it, you think you're edgy for shitting on Bethesda... But you're just looking like an idiot here and this is an incredibly weird thing to go off on. 
---
That's like defending people's right to rape because cops are shitty with handling rape kits appropriately.  It makes sense to be mad at the cops but that doesn't mean you defend the rapists to do so.
---
More like FO1ST Master Race now...
---
 apparently there still is a inv steal hack but it's more complex
---
Is there a time limit on the current new riot and tent variant? I remember the first month i i believe it had like a 23 days period. I'll get 1st again but I would like to wait as late as I can.
---
Not looking for fight. But if were talking guns I'm running a quad faster fire rate tesla (strictly used for pvp)
---
Not my job, if you need the affirmation of strangers that is your problem.
---
Dude, we are talking about a game engine that can't even handle vehicles properly. Don't talk shit just because you took a few classes. Creation engine has been a hobbled mess from the start and comparing it to Unreal is so ridiculous I doubt your credibility.
---
hey mate i wouldnt play fallout 76 rn. as there a huge surge of  a hacker stealing entire player inventory on pc on adventure mode. do far i think over 500 accounts have been affected
---
Scrap box is the main thing that makes it worth it for me. You build up a lot of junk running all 3 difficulties of the Vault raids daily.
---
There is, don't shoot them.
---
You know there's a reason this subreddit has a suggestion and question flair right?
---
Well it just so happens that I have a tse laser rifle fot sell. Time to fight fire with fire. 😎
---
You'd need love in your life for that
---
Or in the case of the company I used to work for, you get half way through then there's 'cost take out' objectives and they tell everyone to complete the same plan, on the same schedule, with the same projected margins, but you know, less cost.  Fucks sake.   I enjoy watching that company stumble from wild claim to miserable failure now.
---
Take my upvote.
---
I haven’t seen a ton of people saying they’ve been a victim of it tbh
---
Well at least from what I read, they basically told BGS what needed to be done to fix it.  People do that all the time with bugs, but this was a little more urgent.
---
Keep in mind, there are several groups at play here - some want to bypass things about the game that they don't like, some just want to cause trouble for various reasons.  There are also some that just look for issues to report, for the sake of the game/community.
---
And at least a few of the people you're talking about are more than competent, though most are just smart enough to follow simple instructions and make small modifications to them.
---
\[x\] doubt
---
Personally, I quit the game because I could no longer stand to play through the bugs and glitches that existed back in late June. I just didn't have the fortitude to continue grinding in the face of what I considered to be a still incomplete game (and I was around Level 240 on my second character by then).
---
One million is putting it lightly. RDR2 is on of the biggest, most ambitious, and greatest games ever made and FO76 is a constantly failing science project.
---
I think the max on the map at once is 16
---
I stand by my statement snowflake.
---
You got up from that piano so fast OMEGALUL
---
Missile solo holotape, should have gotten it as part of the questline.
---
Two hours of playing: 19 small, 6 medium and 3 large. At least I got some large. Not that I got the new lights or Santa crash out of it...grr.
---
If youre interested.
---
Instead of not forgetting you guys should be not playing.
---
At what point will enough be enough for you guys? This is like the 10,000th scandal?
---
Don't be surprised that Bethesda keeps treating you like this when you keep paying them.
---
Bethesda asked everyone affected to contact them
---
I can craft it for you buddy fo free if you provide fluxes for jetpack.
---
If you have 3 or more points to spend in reserve, it won't show up. The game unlocks available perks based on the perk points you've spent...so if you're level 53, and you have, say, 5 points you're holding onto, the game thinks you're level 48, and the level 50 perks won't unlock.
---
Did that make sense, or was that too rambling on my end?
---
Such damage the community suffered today.
---
Your missing the Pyrdwen being in the background.
---
Yup no one would use an operating system based on a kernel that was launched in the early '90s either.  That would be LITERALLY insane. xD
---
The severity was why it was fixed so fast.
---
I dont know man. I mean.. do I enjoy robbing people of junk and murdering them. Yes obviously. But I'm just not sure if that's what I want the rest of my gameplay experience to be. Relying strictly on pvp will getting boring real quick when nobody ever wants to fight and claiming workshops is a hassle
---
Missle Silo state Holo Tape.
---
Ok boomer
---
you summed up mostly why I quit pvp, additional reasons for me would be the guys that cheat to hell and back, I quit back in the stacking bobblehead's / oneshot everything days. the stacking was common and I also had a guy run through a wall. this game is too stupid for actual well balanced pvp. great for many many other things . horrible for pvp. one of the worst I have seen in decades of gaming. 
---
so either you're seal clubbing, being seal clubbed , or hacking if you want to pvp. 
---
and then lets get to the legendaries market. after this last hacking fiasco I have come to realize legendaries are the root of all thats evil in this game. its why people hack, they sell them on ebay, they use them to break pvp. and since I adopted brother hood ways and started using ony vanilla weapons I have found the game to be more engaging. so legendaries make the end game boring. whats that got to do with pvp? pvpers are the best customers for legendary dealers. the whole legendary market needs to be eradicated in my opinion. 
---
I dont even take shops any more. since I lost my main legendary I have even changed my primary weapon to a vanilla .50 cal. this means I wont have to own a power plant for fusion cores ever again. IF beth refunds my legendaries I still wont use them. I prefer my BOS role. destroying legendaries feels good.
---
You are fine on console. For PC this isn't anything new.
---
I put in a ticket months ago that never got a response. You expect me to believe you'll magically know how to compensate me if I put in a new ticket now?
---
 
---
I have been such a fan of this game regardless of the glitches bugs and hacks, but your support team is one of the worst! You are doing next to nothing for your fans and customers. You are letting them suffer and neglecting your community. 
---
On top of issues like this where you dont even know how to fix it or how bad it is, and knowingly let it continue, you have also had dedicated players finding and reporting issues with the game and had them banned. You've lost me today, Betheada.
---
&gt; The Gambryo engine originally was designed for MMO's.
---
They never used the net code, so that is not relevant. And the engine has changed so much and been through so many rewrites since then, it is hardly "gamebryo" anymore. Equating it to that is disingenuous.
---
&gt; All they did was take multiplayer code from Quake and brute force it into the creation engine.
---
Not remotely as easy as you make it sound. Engines not designed for multiplayer from the beginning are extremely difficult to cram net code into, especially when they are literally designed around a single player. They literally referred to the player as "atlas" in code because of how important it was to the functioning of the game.
---
You do realize that Rockstar has had the same issues in the past right?
---
I had stopped playing for about three months not long after beta was released. I had started again and was really into it. And then didn’t have the same passion I used to, just recently starting to get back into the game after Halloween event. 
---
Bugs did push me away from the game, but the fallout multiplayer aspect of the game always brought me back.
---
Merry Christmas from southeast Kentucky!
---
This is my new favorite comment. Thank you
---
The hackers likely don't have anything real, like money or friends or freedom, to lose.  They feel that this validates them, and gives them notoriety.  Heroes of their own imprisoned minds.
---
Sad really, that they take so much joy in doing so little of value with so much, but yet still can't bring themselves to acknowledge how pinprick small they really are.
---
&gt;Do a sensible thing and play another game **permanently**.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
If you somehow don't have it, the military wing vendor will sell you a new one too.
---
What happens when you get a legendary and close the game right away?
---
I decided to cancel my fo1 subscription and uninstall fo76. Bethesda just doesn't seem to be capable to create quality game in at least reasonable state.
---
if you threw it away like I did you can buy another one in the enclave bunker in that last room with the PA racks and such. I may have disposed of 3 in my time playing. theyre expensive lol.
---
Oh shit, Thanks for the warning man,  Happy holidays and thank you
---
Interesting, I dust off the ol’ JE LMG and my pocket magnum aka quad gamma just for PvP. Is the quad Tesla really effective PVP? I have read complaints about it here, but haven’t seen one used in that kind of action.
---
Ive been feeling like getting into pvp. Ive already got a qffr tesla but I would be awful at it. Be a mix of pve and pvp. Just dont become a food build.
---
You don't own the goods. Bethesda owns the goods. They have very little to gain by pursuing a lawsuit. They have VERY much to lose.
---
Also, you're misconstruing my disdain for Bethesda as support for the hackers. What makes me curious is why you are defending a company that treats their consumers so poorly, and instead defending them from those that exploit their terrible business practices?
---
You dont even sell the ones you pick up? You just chunk them in the trash.
---
"Only a small number of people effected." Uh what? Theres over 500 people in a single video alone.
---
I'm not comparing the two engines. They are different engines, created by different companies with different purposes in mind. I'm pointing out that engines don't get replaced wholesale. They evolve over time. Bits and pieces are updated, like an operating system. That's how Unreal is still in use today, 21 years after it came out. The Creation Engine is 11 years old and is not the same Creation Engine as it was on Day 1. That doesn't mean that Bethesda needs to completely abandon the Creation Engine.
---
i am unsure, the instant i see it in there i claim it. i do not care what it is
---
This ain't a slight bug lol
---
agreed courier. this attack lost us a good chunk of fanbase :( I will miss you fellow appalachians I do not want to see you go. but I understand :(
---
I don’t play this game anymore, haven’t for months so I’m safe but yea if you steal a lemon it’s most times overlooked because petty theft isn’t worth the time to even write up while felony theft is. But I get what your saying it’s the principle not the items stolen. Bethesda has just turned into a big let down and I refuse to give them any more of a dime that I’ve earned
---
That what I got for my build. Use lever action for pve and qffr tesla for pvp. Dont get me wrong the weapon in powerful but lackluster against people using absurd weapons that make it impossible to get up close
---
Did you play fallout 4? Even a non multiplayer game was full of insane engine bugs that had to be patched. If bethesda moved fallout 76 to Unreal engine we would not be having these issues.
---
* 500+ 
---
* A few
---
There is only one correct answer here please don't be so naive
---
Unless what he’s saying is lies, your edit is meaningless. 
---
If a Chef cooks a dish and people get sick, can news outlets report on it? Or can only the people who were sick report on it? 
---
Fact is that there are bugs. He’s just stating it like it is. He gets flak for every game he talks about, good or bad
---
W/ this logic, EScrolls games should play like Fallout games.
---
If the other person doesnt have a weapons that doesnt kill you in 2 seconds from half a mile away then yes. It's a absolute cold blooded monster that take no skill to use. Just hop around like a crackhead and let that puppy go.
---
That's not really *that* bad of a grind though, I'm sure we've all seen much worse in many other games. 
---
Realistically it's only about 20 decent games with an average of 10+ kills -- or even simply just that many *wins* with a good team, even with a low kill count.  Averaging around 1-1.5K xp per match isn't too hard if you put together consistent teams to play with. (Don't listen to Zax, *DO* make friends.. lol.  Especially ones who seem to often play at the same times you are.)
---
[I'm thining maybe double that many games for bush campers who hide as long as they can?  Idk how much xp that earns per match, so can't really put a solid number on it, but I do know people out there who do it.]
---
Most importantly -- does anyone know when the last day to earn the rewards is?
---
Thank you so much. I was looking everywhere
---
At least he wasnt spawning airships in pvp to snipe from.
---
Inert bombs? You can drop those. All those duplicate keys and Raleigh's passwords o.t.o.h: &lt;sigh&gt;
---
Yeah, when I was looking for them I just googled it. Came up with a multitude of thread, but I didn't bookmark them, so I don't have them on hand. Here's the imgur I just found, though. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/GeOXrBr
---
There's been severe bugs before that took months to patch because they had to figure out exactly what was causing it, even their fixes break more stuff. Just saying, these hacks must have been v minor datawise for them to fix them so quickly. Not saying minor in the impact, only minor to fix
---
its the only logical thing to do take the servers down,
---
Every one should mark their underwear so you can recognize them if they are stolen. ... Hmmm .. how to mark underwear... 😁
---
This is worse for PR if not fixed quickly.
---
I'm not a member, I'm just here for the drama. 
---
But that said, if you're asking me to not play? 
---
Crud at that point I started wrecking blizzard games after the whole Hong Kong thing.
---
Yes, I did okay Fallout 4. I hated the Boston crashes. I'm glad they patched it over time, and I'm glad the game was open for modders to improve performance even further. 
---
If Bethesda moved Fallout 76 to Unreal Engine, we wouldn't have Fallout 76. There is no alternate engine out there today that could provide a Fallout experience. For everything that is crappy about the Creation Engine, it is unrivaled for expansive world creation.
---
I my not be the best to give the absolute best advice but, use an explosive gatling plasma, explosive laser rifle, or an anti armor or furious handmade/fixer. A quad tesla is a good gun but, not a gun to be a main. Use assassin sentinel too!
---
I don't think anyone has ever underestimated them, they put way more hours in hacking then any studio can afford to combat. 
---
Employees do it for a paycheck and put in hours, but them hours pale in comparison to what the hackers do. maybe they do it for money, but most are probably just doing it because they can, or for pride and or ego just to say they did it
---
And that's why you play on console.
---
Unreal could absolutely mimic Bethesda's designs. Unreal is the best game engine around bar none.
---
Lever action is just a simple preference. As for tesla that wasn't a choice. It the only weapon I can get for pvp that doesnt cost 4 characters at max caps to buy
---
or just make a new character and relive the lore you missed caused you were dazed and confused the first time.
---
Ohhh no they stole my pipe rifl... ohh wait heres another one.... and theres one.... and theres one....
---
seriously this isn't a laughing matter at the same time its not really a panic matter - stay calm and just either take a few days to enjoy christmas or play another game
---
Yeah I feel that.
---
Did you make a report?
---
You have one mistake with DRM fixed in an ethically dubious manner. The problem with Fallout 76 isn't just one mistake. It's a climate of mistakes. It's bugs that are endemic to an aging engine that should have been corrected before launch, and persist a year after launch. If you wanted a game to compare it to, the original FFXIV would be good...but Square Enix burned the game to the ground and rebuilt it.
---
Because Bethesda
---
I think that the Scrapbox eating everyone's junk was worse from a PR standpoint, as that was entirely on Bethesda, yet it still took a week longer to fix
---
Yeah it can get VERY expensive but, that was my tips that are hopfully decent.
---
Because you guys keep giving them money.
---
I started "developing" my game 15 years ago. If you could 14.9 years with the codebase rotting in my repository "developing". 9 years mean absolute zilch when the actual development time could be as little as 1 year. There's no doubt fo76 was rushed. Not even sure why you're pointing out the 9 years because it means absolutely nothing.

Not yet. I’m drunk. I’m grouchy and I’m gonna eat this peanut butter. Wanna watch?
---
Stop giving them love and they'll no longer treat you like their bastard child.
---
thank you, someone already sent to me, but this is what I was after.
---
I love watching people eat peanut butter :D
---
This is players stealing from other players. The amount of news stories you could make from angry fans is insane.  The scrap box eating junk was bad but not newsworthy beyond gaming news. Actual theft of worked for items is much worse than a glitch where the game messes up.
---
The only people still playing this game are either Diehard Bethesda fans, apparently fine with the company shitting in their faces over and over again, or people caught in the net of Sunk Cost Fallacy.
---
There’s not really any positives you can say for this game that you could have with any other far better multiplayer game.
---
Xbox gamepass for a $1 sounds good, you can play Outer Worlds which of course is Fallout new vegas on steroids.
---
Delete all traces of the game too.
---
Yeah well this particular hack requires a 3rd party software. And if I recall it’s PC only? I’ll believe theft is possible on console when I see it, until then your words are empty.
---
I notice a bunch of people complaining here are being downvoted...so I'm just here to upvote y'all (the commenters having problems). Merry Christmas
---
If people didn't watch his shit he wouldn't make it.
---
There was a post from the creator of the .dll on the forum it was originally posted on. This [kotaku](https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/12/16/hackers-find-way-to-add-npcs-to-fallout-76) article should be able to send you in the right direction.
---
Any feedback is good feedback. Glad uo took some time to give some
---
Dang!
---
I'm probably going to be downvoted for this, but given that they had access to the code, I think their response time was slow and I'm not sure why they didn't patch it before the hack went live.
---
Wait, when did this happen? As close to an exact time as you can get, please, it's important.
---
With so much time invested in this game I find it hard to believe you don't just buy a 1st sub and use a private server until this all blows over, to give it up completely, nah, still not buying it.
---
Also never forget that you chose to continue playing this pile of dogshit. I gave up on this shit about a month after release
---
Bethesda: "f**k you.  pay me"
---
no hell no someone might find em. I find a nice remote bush or ditch. I used to do this  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  I sold 20 to 50 legendaries a day off my vendors for very cheap prices in order to make a little money but also help players out. I am sure some of the peeps buying me out were reselling on ebay but I didnt care because it was no over all ill effect on the game. but now. some of the people using this hack I am sure were doing it specifically for profit. I dont want to help them in any way. the legendary market needs to burn. I will not buy or sell.  all looted will be destroyed. and in the 6 or so hours I played today I have adjusted my build to not only solo the nuke launch but also kill the queen about 3 times. by the third silo run I ran it in the same amount of time as I did with my legendaries. by the third queen fight I found the difficulty only just high enough to make it more interesting. not daunting or too hard. 100 percent with no mutations and all vanilla gear. the key is nuka cola perk and buying all the nuka cola at the white spring. grape for rad removal etc  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f19595c&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sg2p10e82em1eh2ep0c72cr0ic4ii0ip2s72at1l92ls2lm2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=BOS%20Heavy%20Natural%20](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f19595c&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sg2p10e82em1eh2ep0c72cr0ic4ii0ip2s72at1l92ls2lm2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=BOS%20Heavy%20Natural%20) 
---
you can go in there with each guy and just buy her out with each character and have an assload of good heals that also kill thirst, heal, regen ap, no loading animation, I have them hotkeyed in order of power 1 - 6 ish. use reg nukas for topping off etc. 
---
The BOS Role feels good after this hack, fuck the ebayers dupers hackers and pay to winners. I will not only keep on playing I am whipping this games ass without being carried by a godroll weapon and supporting some douche by chipping into the over all legendary economy. Advanced tech corrupts. BOS were right all along who knew.
---
Peanut butter Mmmmmm! 😋
---
Think what you want. It's a free world. Judging by your post history recently all you get enjoyment from is spreading hate for the game which is some odd way of getting attention for yourself for if you were truly upset you'd just quit playing and quit bitching on this forum and move on to something else in life that makes you happy.
---
Kick there asses and fix it so those low life scums can’t use it again. Fuckin losers
---
It's not the fault of the engine being 20 years old, it's the fact that it feels 20 years old cause it's barely been upgraded over the years. With constant development it could feel really nice, but it wasn't given that attention. The age means nothing.
---
Not everyone on Reddit is from the US.. lol
---
Except that the only people who would really care about that was the people who actually still were playing the game. Which, considering how much the game fucked up for most of its launch and the lifespan of the game, is not as many people as Bethesda might have wanted.
---
Not to mention that for every bug they seem to fix, another thirty spring up because they haven’t realized that this game is basically a trash fire they continue to keep pouring oil into.
---
As a developer I can tell you at least one of them is working on this as we speak and will probably do so through Christmas. When shit hits the fan we don’t get days off.
---
The hackers must be bad, because there's no possible way Bethesda improves at *anything*.
---
Peanut butter *is* good comfort food... can I have some too?
---
Besides protection from hackers, you mean?
---
there is a program called cheat engine and another called a cheat injector there are lots of ways to cheat on pc to be honest its why console is far better because programs like this cannot be used unlike on pc
---
Calling him or anyone who does this a "hacker" is like calling a piece of bread with sugar sprinkled on it a cake.
---
Never have I so fully understood the MichaelJackson popcorn gif before now. Basically any gamer not playing the game is living it right now
---
Many of the, so called, "people" the blame Bethesda and side with the hackers are either hacker wannabes, hacker neverwillbes, or hacker degenerates. 
---
Blame Bethesda for bringing the game to market before it was ready.  Blame Bethesda for Atom Shop Pay-to-Win infringements.  Blame Bethesda for focussing too much on players they want to win to their name brand and not enough of their loyal fan base.  Don't Blame Bethesda for the actions of self-centered, internet hooligans with too much time and money and little idea of civility.
---
no you do not have to worry only the pc players have to worry
---
It'll only be the First subs that weren't affected; the ones that actually lost stuff will be given 20 tons of raw fertilizer.
---
! Remind Me 7 days
---
Fallout 76 really is just a giant Vault Tec experiment after all.
---
By they do you mean the team who did the unofficial patch? As that fixed more than Bethesda ever did.
---
I wanna watch too
---
It's like when the anime villain from the first season comes back to help the heroes
---
But it is just not one bad game, especially for PC players.  NV was unplayable on release and 4 wasn’t much better. It was the modders that fixed most everything in those games.  Let us run the game privately. Let the fans make fixes and mods. Give us back the Fallout we love.
---
 I pre-ordered the PA edition, got to level 100 and just couldn’t take the bugs anymore. I always held out hope that once we got private servers things would get better. But nope it still looks like a dumpster fire.
---
&gt;Open your fucking eyes Bethesda.
---
Why should they? Bethesda doesn't have to do jack shit as long as people keep playing their game. The fact people continue to defend Bethesda after this debacle says it all.
---
They fix one hack and another one pops up lol.
---
The Creation Engine isn't a general purpose engine. It's tailor-made for the way that Bethesda tells an expansive, detailed story. Unreal is a more general purpose engine that can be customized, but it isn't specialized like the Creation Engine. There's no fair way to compare them when they are completely different animals.
---
lol
---
Bethesda: that's some meta PvP
---
I'm so glad I waited on this one, a win for r/atientgamers
---
Most of the people bitching and moaning hold up New Vegas as the greatest Fallout ever but cite bugs as the reason 76 is a bad game. I to this day can't have more than one save file on New Vegas or the game will crash every time I hit a loading screen.
---
Both. The unofficial patch was a necessity.
---
I fully agree with you. My boyfriend and I bonded over games in the beginning of our relationship, and he was obsessed with Fallout but I had never heard of it. After we had been dating awhile, Fallout 4 came out, and I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if both Nate and Nora survived cryostasis and made it out to search for Shaun. From that moment, I had wished so hard I could experience the wasteland with him and other friends at our side. 
---
I live in southeast Kentucky, which borders West Virginia and is in central Appalachia, so we were even more excited for a Fallout game in our region of the U.S.!
---
I am so in love with this game. The concept is magnificent and truly a dream come true. I can easily overlook the bugs because the fact that the game came true was enough for me... but now I am starting to see that Bethesda is not giving it the attention and care it needs. I will continue to play this game no matter what probably, but it is starting to break my heart that Bethesda is failing this game. Everyone is getting angry and scared off. 
---
It's even worse because Appalachia is a unique region of the U.S. that needs a lot of attention right now. We are struggling. But to see it so well represented in a game that allows tons of players see it and experience it is truly amazing. I wish Bethesda would do this game better justice.
---
Hey guys, is it too late to get in on this watching peanutbutter eating?
---
I think it's 1650 per month.
---
I had a similar problem, but mine was if I had more than a couple saves, and die, if I tried to reload my game would freeze in loading screen and I would have to restart it.
---
I agree. The story is ass, but it's great for settlement mode and survival stuff. :3
---
That explains it very well thank I had 7 points in reserve, you’re a lifesaver
---
I was the one who kept crashing in this lovely game. Thank you again, Oliver!
---
That, by far, is the clearest explanation I've ever seen on the matter. Props. 👍
---
Well, Fallout 76 is one of the first games I ever played that deleted itself from the hard drive. Logically, this is the next step in the 'Games as a Service' model.
---
Oh I didn’t know outer worlds was new Las Vegas, thanks!
---
Lmao the fact you need a source for this shit

Monetary value?  Cash shop items have explicitly /zero/ monetary value.  They are worth /nothing/.  That's why loot boxes can exist in a legal gray area.  Why companies can unilaterally revoke or destroy virtual goods without compensation.
---
You are absolutely correct, and for those not fully aware, here's a few tidbits as outlined in the Zenimax Media Terms of Service...
---
"You agree that You have no ownership right or title in or to any such Downloadable Content, including, but not limited to, the virtual goods appearing or originating in the Services (such as a Game) or any other attributes associated with any Account or Services."
---
In addition to that... 
---
" You acknowledge and agree that ZeniMax will have no liability for the use or loss of Downloadable Content (including without limitation Virtual Currency) for any reason, including without limitation due to any activity of a third-party, such as hacking, phishing, or any other unauthorized activity."
---
Legally, players don't even own any of the Atoms they may purchase... 
---
" Virtual Currency is not property in which You have any ownership right, title, or other interest."
---
I'm no legal expert, and I'm sure this is most likely all pretty standard across any online gaming platform, but it's always good to be aware of how few rights you actually have in these situations.

---
I wonder if it could be possible that with all the bugs and hacks, there was too much negativity from the community, therefore giving Bethesda more reason to believe the game is a lost cause? 
---
The community speaking up and reporting bugs and hacks is exactly what needs to happen, but at the same time this community can be very, very toxic.
---
Yea, I would have liked to have the option of getting just the hat instead of the entire Santa outfit.
---
Hold on, they fixed the items being spawned in? I thought that's still a possibility. I didn't see any news about it. Also the dr bug isn't 5 months, it was there pretty much forever. Just not very noticeable because of how primary effects work. And the game was so bugged back then that people were able to blame it on other things. And not to mention all the other bugs, simple and complex, that have been around since launch. But yeah, hopefully faster response time is a trend that continues rather than just being a fluke
---
I'm confused, are you saying people lost their stuff without having launched the game?
---
&gt;So when people piss and moan about the Creation Engine, it's pretty ignorant. 
---
I've long suspected that people blaming the   engine know absolutely nothing about  engines or how they work.        I certainly don't, nor do I pretend to. 
---
And I've also suspected that the problem was not simply an old engine, but an old engine that has not been improved upon (but could be if priorities were in line at the company).
---
Businesses make a quality product, then you pay them. You don't pay them and hope they make a product you'll like.
---
Lolwut?
---
You can bankrupt them and take all their equipment. Get a good enough lawyer involved and you can take their accounts too
---
I spent roughly 70k the first day.   Since then about 2k a day, I’m down to 53 caps currently. Worth every cap!!
---
I just wonder how well (if at all) they can know which people did it outside of the ones behind the exploit. I want to be optimistic, but I'm somewhat skeptical they have the tools or the system in place for finding those who abused this exploit.
---
Not multiplayer in this sense, but I'd love to be able to play this with my group of buds and mod the heck out of this game.
---
This is still on them but could've effected a much larger amount of people left unchecked.
---
Given that there was a large group who thought first subs losing their scrap was "deserved," and this was potentially going to get waaaay more people than that...this was basically PR suicide if it wasn't fixed.
---
Exactly what are your credentials in programming game engines?
---
No problem man, Happy Holidays! May your servers be strong, and your loot be plentiful.
---
lmao
---
"the devs have made their game exploitable to the point that it's unplayable! quick, pay them!"
---
Lol the GTA hackers are creative at least and of course I need a source? This is the internet where people pull total bullshit out of a hat. 
---
However both of those games are peer to peer and don't run on what are supposed to be dedicated servers like FO76 so it's a bit different.
---
I’ve hung around to. Let me tell you what I’ve seen. I’ve seen him kill my friends but not harm me. I saw him go to peoples camps and kill them with roses syringer. I’ve seen him launch nukes instantly using the nuke case from nuclear winter in adventure mode. He can be nice and the encounters I’ve had have only been good. Doesn’t make him any less of a dick
---
a few players? one person alone stole the inventories of 532 people, i dunno how math works in your universe but that equates to more than a "few" players
---
Can't wait for the modded single player experience in like half a year.
---
Thats not true for consumables though. Any you paid money for (which people do) are gone for good.
---
Thank god I quit this game weeks ago. Bethesda support doesn't listen to players, they are yet to even reply to my ticket I've sent weeks ago. It's like they don't even exist.
---
Its Russia. The country's run by a guy who had an opposition leader killed off in view of his office. 
---
If it doesnt hurt the state or even benefits the state, Russia will allow itm
---
I honestly didn’t know they helped make Old Republic, that game was incredible. This project was honestly just rushed, I think if they actually gave the game some time, delayed release, we probably wouldn’t be in this state. When a game comes out looking like it was half-assed, it’s not that actual creators of it, it’s management sucking up to the shareholders. These people take heavy pride in their work and love every second of it. It’s the board that should be shamed, the actual hard working people did incredible work in the crap timeframe they were given, using the outdated code they were to follow. Glad to see they finally gave them more time to revamp the game and work on wastelanders a bit longer. Hopefully the management takes notice and stops this bs they’ve been trying to do (let’s be honest, they won’t, but let a man dream for a bit).
---
I can't tell if this is sarcasm or not. You're playing a Battle Royale, so I can only assume that it is.
---
I got mothman! So stoked!! 3 Santa crash and a single winter icicle, two plasma granades.
---
Totally investment is ~40k caps plus personal farmed holiday scorched.
---
Lol. The dude came in to help my friend code, and we were talking for a bit, and then another friend casually goes “I bet that happens a lot at Bethesda” and I’m like “why did I not know you worked there?!” I make vr games and asked him if they were looking into more vr stuff cause of half life alyx. He called vr a gimmick and had a lot of out of touch reasons why. I didn’t talk to him long about working at beth cause I didn’t want him getting annoyed, but I really look forward to talking about it more with him. I’ve talked to a couple people in the game dev industry that have worked on huge titles. They all seem to lose touch with people who love to play games because of the corporate environment.
---
I didn’t have the chance to ask. Think it might be inappropriate for me to do so.
---
.....? When's the last time you seriously played ESO? Because what you're saying doesn't at all fit the version of ESO I played just a month ago. We ARE talking about The Elder Scrolls online right? Because ESO isn't a tab targeting 30 skill multi bar MMO like SWTOR or WoW whatsoever so I'm really confused. Are we talking about how it was in beta??
---
Rimworld has fucking atrocious optimization. It's also an incredibly simple game.
---
I love it to death, but lets not praise it for things it's not.
---
Cowards
---
you have to pay to win at pvp in 76, either in game or in in ebay. this is exactly why I am destroying legendaries and not buying or selling anymore. go ahead lego buy the mans tse laser rifle and be a winner. get carried by that legacy crap that's been duped 500 times.
---
why drop them, when you can make blast mines?
---
The hack was fixed somewhere around 6 - 8hrs ago.
---
DcLol go fuck yourselves. “Only a small number of players” stop trying to downplay this gigantic fuck up, it wasn’t a “small number of players” it was probably in the 1000s at least considering one dude screwed over 500 people on his own. You guys are a stain on the gaming community
---
Cunts
---
Bethesda will never be giving Fallout 1st free for a month as compensation for anything. People have already paid for a year of 1st and there's nothing they can give those people that's worth as much as a month of 1st. The way the game is shedding players, months added after that year is over won't be worth as much as a free month anytime soon.
---
Your speculation to the number of players is no more evidenced than anyone else. If anything - less. Because BGS is doing everything you’d expect a company with a dwindling player base to do, like upping mtx to squeeze all they can, framing wastelanders as a kind of soft relaunch, shoehorning a battle royals, etc...
---
I mean, the game is trash and everyone knows it - even you. No one cares if you want to live in denial and just look like a weirdo. Weirdo.
---
Is this hack PC exclusive?
---
Considering there are potentially thousands of players on each system (PC, Xbox, PS4) then yes 500 is a few players.  Just like a city with a population of 500 can still be a tiny city because of over all country population or the population of other cities.
---
That's technically not accurate though. Here no one's smashing any windows to hack the game they're merely making use of open doors Bethesda left open, and were warned about. It would be more fitting to say someone stealing from your car because you left the doors unlocked as that's more what's happened here.
---
Rainbow Six Siege is dedicated servers.
---
You don't have much chill do you. Also pretty presumptuous to assume I'm going to buy the gun from him
---
Ok bye, have a nice life.
---
Around 1 CST approx.
---
How many players are on X box and PS4 as well as PC?
---
&gt;a few players
---
There's literally a video on YouTube of a single guy doing it to over 500 different characters, don't try and phrase it like this is an insignificant issue.
---
Never.
---
yeah, but how do you tell which posts are legitimate and which are not? it's only going to lead to a bunch of innocent people getting banned, that's my point.
---
No clue. I'm referencing how Bethesda is openly acknowledging "a few" players were affected when clearly there is video evidence that hundreds were affected.
---
Thank god
---
No, it's not possible to do on consoles. Consoles are locked down by Microsoft and Sony.
---
Actively working of solution would mean closing servers for a day, NOT by letting hackers know that they have limited timetable to steal some more.
---
still possible to place stuff in inventory that gets them banned. so still not safe. and yes, ppl are running around doing that
---
Not my words since I dont play on console. But if you read in this threat theres console players agreeing with each other that they've seen the Prydwen. Do with that information whatever the hell you want.
---
Just realize xbones are basically running win10, people homebrew all the time. Im not very into xbox OS exploit, but its possible to play with hacks on the ps4. Heck, dark souls 3 on consoles has its fair share of them.
---
You must be talking about me! 100 is my max, but up until this holiday event I had caps to burn. If you had any amount of maps at 100 caps a piece, no brainer... Sold! I must be pushing close to 400 maps by now.
---
PC btw, if anyone is selling 😋
---
living there is probably punishment enough
---
Bethesda started the whole trend of cosmetic dlc with their oblivion horse armor. Fifa started the lootbox trend, overwatch popularized it. THINGS DON'T HAPPEN IN A BUBBLE. Problems are spoken out against because (bad) practices practices get copied from other sources, when they are profitable. If not buying something was enough f76 wouldn't have been released in the state it was. Remember no man's aky?
---
While I agree with what you're saying, on the flip side having a teammate that could've been saved give up would be even more frustrating, and likely happen often in pub. teams.
---
Yeah, on TV! In reality you still need proof!
---
I played for like 5 days telling myself it would get better as the game progressed - shot was just unbalanced and janky at lower levels. It would smooth out.
---
It became clear by ~lvl 25 the game was just torally fucked. It was at best an early closed beta state. Asked for a refund, denied.
---
Since I’m saddled with the fucking thing checked in and tried it out after major updates hoping it would get better, it didn’t. Worse, somehow.
---
It’s cool, I’ll seed the shot out of the new EoS and Starfield. Fuck me, I’ll fuck right back.
---
:( sorry for your loss my man. my wife and I got screwed too. this hack will take a big chunk of the fan base. dunno if the wife will stay or not at this point. :( I am staying though. I am rocking vanilla gear and boycotting the legendary market. advictorium mother frs. BOS role all the way. probably scrapped 20 to 50 legendaries today. not buying them not selling them not using them. feels good each weapon I drop into a ditch is like a big old FU to dupers hackers and pay to winners. no more shop taking at all either. pvpers like to take shops, pvpers are number 1 pay to winners, changed wepon type to .50 so I never have to take a shop again either.
---
seems to be the case most of the time when there arent enough developers or engineers to run into logistic issues.
---
Oh fuck yea, I completely forgot about the scrapboxes and repair kits.  Ok I understand now. I take back my statement.
---
AM or PM?
---
Wow.
---
Im always down for non stealth boy, non legacy pvp. That said it's a rarity to find anyone like minded.
---
I see what you mean. I wouldn’t give up if my team mates were near by tho often times my teammates just leave me to die which is just as frustrating.
---
you need chocolate for that peanut butter sir.
---
Why wouldn't you believe him? He manages to squeeze a hundred into an 8 minute video - even assuming it takes him ten times as long to actually get all that footage and squeeze it down that's a hundred dudes in less than 2 hours. You reckon that's all he had time for, or you reckon he just had an epiphany at that point and went, "shit, this is kind of douchey, lemme just upload the vid and then I'm going to cease my hacking ways"?
---
Well said
---
Before the patch, then. And here I thought the hackers had already adapted.
---
That's a technicality. I think most people understand that the engine could become far better than it is *currently* if Bethesda actually invested into it. But when you have the *same bugs* from older titles appearing in games like Skyrim and Fallout 4... it doesn't matter if Bethesda *could* fix things and that it isn't *technically* the engine itself that's the problem. The fact of the matter is that Bethesda haven't fixed their engine, and if they have invested into it and added new functionality or whatever else, they don't seem to have gone back and old issues. Maybe if they made a new engine it might actually be better than what we have currently, since Bethesda don't seem very inclined (or able?) to give much TLC to the one they have at the moment.
---
If I could I would just pvp with my lever action. Certain people make that not possible lol
---
I can't believe people are responding to this as if you were being serious. Enjoy the trolling... They're making it way too easy. I hope they catch on before they get too upset.
---
It was $10 on amazon a few days ago
---
That's why I say I get what you're saying. I play extremely aggressively which has landed me in such a position many times, but I see the writing on the wall if it were to be changed.
---
Man that sucks I think you may have the correct idea w the legendary boycott. Good luck rebuilding hope your wife stays got your sake. I love gaming w the wife, just hard to find games we both enjoy and loading one we do play would be a huge loss.
---
And then start locking their doors and windows.
---
Unreal engine and Creation Engine are like Apple and Orange, both are different. Just like Mac, Windows, and Linux, are different from each other.
---
Nah I’m drunk and pissed off about earlier
---
This has nothing to do with Wastelanders. It was added way back in Wild Appalachia.
---
There are working showers in Vault 51!
---
Always interesting when you recognize some names. Good luck with the channel.
---
Its fun
---
Yes and 500 can still be a few of the over all players or even players on a specific version of the game.  Your entire complaint about word usage is undermined by the basic understanding of scale.
---
Yeah. Didn’t know they patched it even.  I’m sure they’ll find a work around soon though. Crafty bitches are like cockroaches ya can killem
---
I saw that. What's the deal with those? PA became popular in the last version of survival but pulse mines would snap them out of existence. So I kinda make or keep them and plasma.
---
Few nuka for buttholes but that's a different story.
---
Only on PC
---
They would make a ton of money off faction based stuff. They just picked a bad one to do with the Free States. I am a Responders guy myself and have built a badass police station. I would like to have signs and such.
---
If they just released the BOS and Enclave bundles people would be all over it. And possibly have the faction war idea implemented easily
---
I know that. I’m just saying that I wish we could get a mutant settlement when wastelanders comes out..
---
The games fun. Not that deep.
---
Still only happening on PC. PC players greifing other PC players whilst shouting PC master race. That’s why most PC players avoided survival and are avoiding survival and either using private servers or console.
---
You online? I'll come check out your camp
---
Woohoo!
---
Oh, I have no doubt they'll be back. I just thought it would take longer than a few hours.

This is how I feel as well and thanks for putting it into words. Scrap can be collected again no problem and you lose junk when you die already so it already has a sense of unimportance. However losing my favorite guns would be devastating. On my main alone I carry about 50 guns or more due to weight reduction armor and perks. Some "God roll" heavies, no legacies but I can only imagine... Not only that that all the ammo, fuzzy tokens, maps, rare outfits you like to wear, various aid items, etc would be heartbreaking to lose. I would quit the game and never look back. Im sure bsg has thought about this as well. It's unfortunate it's during the seasonal event as some players are playing more than usual.
---
It really is. I can't ever imagine playing a single player Bethesda game again.
---
ESO was cool when it finally got it's shit together, but still feels alone.
---
76 feels like random people are joining my game and I just go see what they are up to.
---
Multiplayer adds so much that even the weird shit is often funny cause you can enjoy it with friends or strangers.
---
"PC master race" has nothing to do with this, blame the devs for poor security and shitty coding. I can name free games on pc by smaller indie companies that never had this problem.
---
Granted, But it’s white “chocolate” almond bark and it’s like five years old
---
Sounds like a personal problem, and by personal I mean you can just mod it. It's honestly a shame that you can't find any interest in F:NV just because of a save bug, but meanwhile this is the game you've chosen to play and defend (I should clarify though that wanting a Fallout experience with friends is a great idea). You want someone to come in and bash on F76 for something other than bugs and glitches? Sure, I can do that, it's an empty world full of whatever type of person is on this sub and a few hackers. 
---
This game is an MMO, and therefore shouldn't even be compared to any other game in the franchise. The goals of the game are for longevity and loot instead of story and depth, which is fine and I'm sure why people love WoW to this day, among other things. What they should have done was make the damn game the same way but put some effort into everything instead of just using it as a cashgrab. I feel like the lot of the people still defending this game are just so used to being whipped that they just accept that shits hitting the fan all the time that they just work around it. That's really admirable, and shows a lot of patience, and since you can't get refunds anymore this is really the only option you guys have anymore. It's a shame, I mean it, this game should be a fun experience. It should have all the side options that F1st came with (private servers, loot increases etc.) buy without the pricetag. If this game made as much money as they said it did, everything they gave for the F1st package (minus the Atoms) should have been free. 
---
Mods are our saving grace in this world of Bethesda programming, and after I beat all the other Fallout (3, NV, and 4) I modded the crap out of them because I could. I still had fun playing and beating them the way they were presented, but giving the option of customization for free by people in the community that have a passion for new experiences and gameplay, it really adds to the experience. Can't do that in 76, but one can play a janky game with a few friends before the game crashes randomly, or you get all your items stolen, or nukes don't stop falling, or the thing your shooting at freezes in mid animation...It really is bad netcode sheesh. I rack my brain, looking back at Fallout 4, and can't remember seeing any of the problems that cropped up with this iteration. 
---
But hey at least you can't get a corrupted save in Fallout 76, you just get scammed by hackers. Which, in my opinion, really is the best experience because it constantly reminds you that you bought this game from some slimy thieves that just wanted your money after they stole (I mean bought) this IP from elsewhere. 
---
Have a merry christmas though, because at the end of the day you should be able to enjoy the things you enjoy, it's just (again) a shame that the thing you enjoy doesn't seem to want you to enjoy it. Glhf
---
The Wasteland Estates HOA are some of the best people I have had the pleasure of knowing in this game! So glad to be a part of this community!!!
---
We don’t live and breathe outrage culture but instead play it for fun.
---
These group of great individuals are raunchy as well as amazing, but they've all got their hearts in the right place. It's groups like these that make me glad we have people like this in Appalachia, no matter what version we play. :)
---
Nobody cares.
---
Meanwhile meaning forever.
---
Seriously?  You were expecting the fix for this to be client side? Downloaded updates are for sending you new assets and shit, this entire hack is abusing things server side and that's what they were patching when they took the servers down earlier today.
---
My complaint is that Bethesda themselves is undermining the scale of the problem by claiming the issue to be less widespread than it actually is. By saying, "a few players" were affected when clearly that is not the case, it seems like a poor attempt at damage control.  It's also mildly infuriating that they would paint this as a minor issue when anyone that plays this game knows that having your inventory looted in an instant is the most game-breaking thing that exists currently!
---
The player interaction overweights bugs ;D
---
Who hurt you pal?
---
Weird how for a so called "shit game !!!!!" 76 is targeted so regularly by hackers  ?.
---
Starting to think the hacking, and  worst complainers on the forums are a rival.
---
Not saying 76 does not have problems that need sorting.
---
Just that there are a few whose hatred for this game is now bordering on the irrational.Coupled with the regular hacking targeting a game that supposedly is of no interest to anyone these days other than we who enjoy it.
---
Why target gamers in such a malicious spiteful way ?
---
Yeah. Gt: Tenxitemsorless
---
Xbox one
---
Stockholm Syndrome. The game held our money ransom promising that good things will come, but they never did. Now people started thinking that whatever half baked morsel is thrown at us is the best we can do and try to squeeze the juice out of this bone dry husk.
---
Also known as "battered wife syndrome": "I can change him", "Deep down he is good" "It's ok he is hitting me, what if he killed me instead" "He is not that bad, others are worse". Sounds familiar?
---
Reading a post now about poor programming and netcode issues.
---
I’m a PC vendor but I think that some truths hold true:
---
- Vendor sales are based on probability.  It is random whether or not that person who wants to buy something from you happens to be on the same server and is actively looking to buy.  Over time, it should balance out, but in the short term it is hit or miss.
---
- Location, location, location.  If you are out of the way, many players won’t travel to your camp.
---
- Pricing tends to be all over the place for vending.  Price too high and you will take a long time to sell it or may never sell it.  Low prices mean faster turnover, but you could have gotten more.  If you travel to different camps, you should see different pricing.
---
- It’s easy to get holiday gifts right now.  Most players feel that they might be able to get unknown plans.  After the holiday season is done, players will want to fill in gaps.  And there will be those who didn’t participate.
---
This. The scrap box and atoms pretty much sold it for me. That's the same reason I got the eso sub a while back. The tent is nice but I could live without it.
---
I don't know why, but as I was reading this I expected you to finish with "...track them down and kill them" and my eyebrows raised before reading what you actually said lol
---
"a few". lmao
---
So has anyone continuing to post in this thread even bothered to take notice that they already took the servers down for a server side patch almost eight fucking hours ago?
---
That would have escalated quickly.
---
That's a pretty build!   I love the bar especially!   So well done!
---
There is a spreadaheet of all available drops from holiday event, and their respective odds. Rare mounted plans, common mounted plans, weapon/armor/mod/prime plan, etc here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ea64ac/complete_guide_to_the_holiday_event_with_drop/
---
If you are overloaded, dump the common mounted plans, and undesirable weapon/mod/primw plans.
---
I thought RDR2 was Shit.
---
Bored me senseless.
---
Tried to stick with it.Put 8 hours in to the game,hated it.
---
We are all different.
---
I now have 500 hours in Fallout 76.
---
So, here's my take on it. (Obviously, this is all just my opinion) 
---
From a marketing standpoint, this is their "cash cow". They KNOW people will spend money on it. 
---
It was VERY weak out of the gate, and very broken. I've played since BETA. And while there are still SO many bugs and glitches that they need to address, the current state of it is LIGHTYEARS away from launch, imho.
---
I like to think of it as the first chapter of the book. The road map we got, is the list of chapters. As a fan of the series since FO3 (NV is my fav, btw), I'm excited to "keep reading". They're storytelling is still some of the best.
---
This is a VERY casual game. Something to do after work to unwind and be someone else for a bit. Sometimes you get bored. Bored people with a little extra spending money might buy some cosmetics, scrap kits, etc. (Guilty.)
---
I can't say I've ever said "I hate this game". I can't. I appreciate it for what it is, and I am still optimistic about the future. It can in NO WAY be as bad as it once was, but I never hated it. Bugs, yes, frustrate the ever living crap out of me... but I don't hate the whole game for it.
---
I think people just need to lighten up about it. Experience from a less hardcore way of play, and just walk around. Interact with other people at your leisure. Enjoy it single-player and stop grinding lol 
---
But again, that's just me 🤷‍♂️
---
&gt; Why target gamers in such a malicious spiteful way ?
---
To show it's possible and to point out that Bethesda has no idea what they are doing. It doesn't matter how many people are playing.
---
LOL, sooo what next Bethesda??? like really this game is a travesty of a live service game. 
---
PUT IT DOWN PLZ AND MOVE TO A NEW GAME, you are bad. The amount of problems this live service had and have is stupid.
---
Its fixed, check forum.
---
Dont trigger the Woke .....
---
Geek, and Nerd, are now deemed offensive hate words by the more educated.
---
Plod will be at your Door next. :-)
---
Happy Christmas to all.
---
It's late, and for whatever reason, I find it funny that you contrasted an engine with food instead of comparing it to...an engine. Like an internal combustion engine. Good engines -can- go for a very long time. They need to be maintained. Their maintenance needs to be well-documented. If you fall behind on maintenance, you might need a new engine. Some engines get replaced before their time and nobody thinks much of it, because a prevalence of bad engines or poor maintenance makes it seem normal.
---
I think I squeezed about all I can out of that analogy.
---
Good post, but they won't. They're just gonna downvote comments like this and bury their heads in the sand. 
---
Quite bewildering and funny to see from afar lol
---
private worlds are more of a tool to farm stuff
---
Stockholm syndrome &amp; battered wife in one post, you must have thought about that crap for a while.
---
Its simpke-
---
Just because you don't enjoy it, doesn't mean we can't. I play everyday as I still enjoy it &amp; I don't get caught up in the hate brigade. Yes the game has issues, but none serious enough that I would no longer want to play
---
I've got my money's worth &amp; then some
---
damage control
---
Thanks for pointing that out.
---
Hmm. Seeing as I couldn't finish fo4 due to pure boredom, I think I just like multiplayer games. Skyrim held me for a bit but the whole way they keep dumbing down the games has taken its toll on me.
---
Morrowind is the game that took me from action to rpg and it's been tough at times to watch both series go for graphics over game play.
---
With 76 came a better story/ I could do whatever the fuck I wanted including going to high lvl areas for good loot. Risk your ass but options are there.
---
It's got a boat load of problems no doubt, but when it does work it's stupid good fun. Reminds me of DayZ. Similar thing. You either deal with the bad for something you enjoy or you don't.
---
This is what makes me the most upset, their poor attempt at damage control by misleading the players into believing it's a small or isolated incident. Lousy dilution of major issues as typical per Bethesda response towards this game.
---
Heh.  Well I used food, because that's the way folks seem to think.  *"Oh that's OLD code.  We should throw it out and get new code...."*  as if it were milk that turned sour.
---
Anytime mate, merry Christmas 💝
---
&gt; My complaint is that Bethesda themselves is undermining the scale of the  problem by claiming the issue to be less widespread than it actually  is. By saying, "a few players" were affected when clearly that is not  the case, 
---
You really don't understand scale do you?
---
In 2018 there were  36,560  motor vehicle deaths. Sounds like a lot until you realize the US population is  327,096,265 in the same year. Meaning 36,560 deaths only makes up 0.011% of the population.
---
So I could with 100% accuracy state that over 36,000 deaths are only a small amount.   
---
Or if you want another comparison in 2018 according to CDC  2,813,503 people died.  This makes motor vehicle fatalities only 1.29% of total deaths in the USA. So I could say with 100% accuracy that only a few people die from motor vehicle accidents.   
---
&gt;   It's also mildly infuriating that they would paint this as a minor  issue when anyone that plays this game knows that having your inventory  looted in an instant is the most game-breaking thing that exists  currently! 
---
It only effects PC which leaves the other 2 systems free of this problem. It also isn't a new issue as GTA Online STILL allows that to happen due to the mod menus and script kiddies.  Rockstar literally removed the need to pay insurance on vehicles on the PC version because mod menus were being used to blow up every player's car in the game and make it seem like 1 player did it. Draining hundreds of thousands of dollars from their character in seconds.
---
Can we call it f1sto?
---
the deepest routes of the core problem lies in that Betesha always relied to the modders to fix their games and gone to point of no return when modders and hackers know more about the engine than Betesda's staff itself. It's literally impossible to fix this game, there will be no end for new hacks.
---
Well that was a legendary comment. One that made reddit history. I can understand why that got gold
---
This is backed up by the fact that one of the first games the engine is based on was an MMORPG that never had hacking problems as bad as Fallout 76 does.  The majority of issues the game has is simply a result of how Bethesda implements their own systems and not on what engine they're using.
---
It's called Fallout 4.
---
Bethesda should have to give a full refund to everyone affected. That would grab their attention quickly. It's too bad that the Consumer Protection Bureau was castrated.
---
You can’t witch-hunt it’s against the rules and you included names
---
IT's nice for people to put some clarity out there about this.
---
But, it's still a problem of the engine, and the limits that said engine put on those designing the netcode.
---
We support this because the game needs to die already.
---
There are a billion problems with the game and Bethesda.
---
It is objectively a bad game, and you sheep refuse to acknowledge it. So we help you quit.
---
As someone who has been robbed on the street:
---
Lol, no.
---
&gt; with 76 came a better story
---
I think I can stop reading since you have clearly decided to lie at this point.
---
 I agree about the barren feel.  I am a solo player, but I like the random interactions with players and the group events are fun.  I have found some friends I just join for those, it has been great.  I would never get that on my private server.
---
dude what you should have done is open your eye and look what terrible game Fallout 76 is and how bad Bugthesda is. They lying, and they keep milking "loyal fans" (blind fans) and they dont want to change a engine that is almost 30 year old. NOT RDY FOR MULTIPLAYER GAMES.
---
As more knowledgeable people have already said, it's not due to the engine
---
Objectively a shit game. Open your damn eyes.
---
I just paid the 700 atoms to get the hat and it turns out it covers all hair no matter how long it is. Wish I would have known that!
---
Yes. I’ve been robbed. Twice.
---
It’s intense and horrific and my god the fuck is wrong with you people?
---
Fallout 76 is not the first game to be hacked on PC,and it certainly wont be the last.Hackers are going to hack,They have been doing this since the age of the internet.
---
PC based games are notoriously vulnerable to hackers.They always have been.
---
This is the reason so many prefer PS4/XBOX
---
Like i said in my post, considering Fallout 76 is a supposedly shit game with a negative press.Seems strange these hackers are buying up accounts and Spoof IPs for nothing more than causing maximum grief to gamers. Almost like they are deliberately tarnishing the product.
---
Then the forums immediately fill with "Bethesda dont know what they are doing","i hate this game","burn Todd alive blah,blah,blah"
---
And that’s your opinion. Have a nice day.
---
Go look for you Dad.. er son. Whatever dude. You enjoy your shit and let me enjoy mine?
---
Ok if it is not the engine fallout 76 has had a hacker problem for months now with out any fixes other than banners that are often very short term
---
No, really. It is objectively horrible.
---
"Hur dur you like Vegas your opinion is wrong"
---
The problem is Bethesda doesn’t look at it like that, they want the quickest, dirtiest, and cheapest option they can get. The Atom shop is constantly flashing new skins but MAJOR issues are taking an incredible amount of time to fix.
---
Bethesda should be forced to offer a full game refund to everyone affected, as well as refund the value of Atom store items. That would grab their attention and guarantee a meaningful response.
---
You part of the fun police or something? Or like a fun cult?
---
The hackers are the people that hate fallout 76 and want the remaining loyal fan base to stop playing. It’s a whole damn conspiracy lemme tell you
---
susceptible, not acceptable, and no, they aren't. It means that the videos can be taken down, but they can't be sued.
---
And your opinion, along with several others, isn’t going to change my mind. I have fun playing the game with my friends. And that’s all that really matters to me. Yes, a lot of things need fixing, but I still enjoy the game.
---
So if Bethesda won’t care why are you trying so hard
---
Reddit has made me painfully aware how fucking dumb and sheltered people have become or always have been outside my little slice of the world.
---
Like, I literally never considered growing up I would ever have someone say something like this to me, straight faced. 
---
It’s almost like it must be performance art.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
It's due to not putting in any checks for hacks besides the bare minimum and pushing out the game anyway because of deadlines. ESO was on a completely fresh engine and the first year was riddled with people hacking with cheat engine. It's because they consider these things minor until it starts hurting their profits
---
From what I've learned the Gamebryo engine was designed to be every modular for the time. Very easy to swap out audio, graphics, etc.  Some issue could be because older system in the creation engine just can't handle the current system demands. Hence why movement speed is still based on FPS. That was an old trick from early days of PS2 era that survived into PS3 era with some engines and more or less faded with PS4 era.
---
You bet!
---
But that's not going to get YouTube views. Or the fallout community who hates the fact that a multiplayer game exists.
---
They just want to jerk them self's off anytime something happens.
---
I left a long time ago I was a day 1 player over 500 hours I would just play another game
---
I wasn’t attempting to be entitled or snotty about it. I’ve put in soooo many hrs into the game and it was waning in interest for me. This is just kind of my last straw/ just the kick I needed moment. I hope it gets fixed and you never have something u grinded for hundreds of times stolen from you. Good luck in those wastes dude.
---
Like I said where is their common sense you can’t get profits if all your players leave due to hacking
---
This, Fallout 76 is the result of Battlecry putting up piss-poor performance and ZeniMax deciding to rebrand them as Bethesda Austin and give them the Fallout IP to slap their shoddy work on to recoup losses when the multiplayer game they were supposed to be making as a studio independent of BGS wasn't panning out.
---
Truth is, the cash was grabbed from the start.
---
Merry Christmas you filthy animals of the wasteland!
---
I've genuinely enjoyed this game since the start, and I still do. The game is honestly a great time sink past the issues that it has but it's a shame that Bethesda, one year after launch, still haven't done basic things that should be done before any MMO launch.
---
Submit a ticket saying the approximate time you noticed your items disappear. You should not need to tell them who did it. That is in no way your responsibility.
---
You can look at  it a diffetent way, a true apocalyptic version where  only a couple of people  survived. 
---
I have fallout 1st &amp; the quietness of an unpopulated world did surprise me at how much it made the game feel different. 
---
Now l mostly use fallout 1st &amp; jump back to adventure to check players vendors, launch nukes or if my caps are getting low., but I play solo 99% of the time.
---
The worst part is it's pretty obvious from all the die hard fans of this game that if done correctly it could have absolutely been a massive success. More so to your point. Look at the map, it's absolutely amazing, the devs on this game took great pride in what they were creating but much like my job where I'm so overloaded I can't finish a single task before moving on to the next, they did what they could with the time they had.. I can almost guarantee that the people working on this game had great passion for it. It's the people at the top that control whats released when..
---
You are demanding forvthe possesion of gods. That shall not be demanded
---
This is actually pretty funny.
---
As opposed to "Go look for your Overseer"? Clearly you have adopted Todd Howard's Sweet Little Lies tactics very well.
---
Also everyone knows which game is the actual shit game.
---
Yeah it's funny... people don't like when a PoS is exposed... it's gotta be censored, but this clown is free to do what he wants lol, and then you, the fans, support this archaic, and backwards bs. SMH.
---
😅😅😅
---
Sure, however I have crammed my font in this jar so may be BYOjar?
---
Not trying to white knight Bethesda here at all, but considering we dont know the exact player numbers of 76, 500-1000 players could be a deop in the bucket compared to the actual player count, hence the term they used. My guess is probably somewhere around 10,000? Idk. Just my guess based on this subreddit's subscriber count and activity compared to other game's subreddits and their player counts.
---
All good on my end now. I got hacked lost my legendaries. got pissed. the wife got hacked and got pissed. After some thinking on the matter I came to the conclusion that legendaries are the root cause of all that's wrong with the game. they encourage people to dupe, hack, cheat, and pay to win. I changed my level 380 to be able to efficently run the silo and do very well in the queen fight while wearing non upgraded power armor and a vanilla .50 cal.  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f19595c&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sg2p10e82em1eh2ep0c72cr0ic4ii0ip2s72at1l92ls2lm2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=BOS%20Heavy%20Natural%20](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f19595c&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sg2p10e82em1eh2ep0c72cr0ic4ii0ip2s72at1l92ls2lm2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=BOS%20Heavy%20Natural%20) 
---
I now destroy legendaries I loot by ditching them in private server or hiding them in remote locations. I am boycotting the entire legendary market.I do not buy sell or use legendaries.  I am kicking the crap out of end game content without being carried by a god roll weapon, it is more rewarding and engaging than ever before. and if I ever do get hacked again the screenshot button is ready and I will have a chance to get a hackers account banned for the low cost of some vanilla gear thats easily replaced. 
---
I would love to see the bulk of the PC comunity join me in my boycott but I doubt it will happen. I cannot change the entire community all I can do is do whats right by me. 
---
Beth may have some flaws with their game but this is a coordinated push to destroy a game I like. this does nothing but make me double down on beth . If they go as far as to hack my account I will buy another one, if I get my toon deleted I will restart. this is the only game on the market worth playing for me and whoever is behind this constant assault on beth can suck it. the hackers are the evil ones here not beth. it was a hard hit to take and it took me off guard at first but I am ready for the next one. the more I rread trash talk about beth the more I go to their corner.
---
Citation not needed. You don't out a source on the inside if you want inside information to keep coming.
---
The Good old days of camping a tower until it decayed and going buck wild, praying the orc hordes didn’t show up.
---
Say what you want about UO, but even out of time and place it was still a more ambitious, ballsy and balance game than 76.
---
ppl like you making this game terrible dude, thank to ppl that are "happy" that besthesda just patch a open wound and didnt fix it, bc lets be real hacking will be back. 
---
Is what make this game the most shitty Fallout ever, and the worst Online service game of the year. 
---
At this point Bugthesda need to shoot this game down and move on. NO ONE WILL MISS IT.
---
Well yeah as I’m the only one in my server I feel pretty safe lol
---
I watched a glowing mole miner take on a scorched officer. The mole miner won.
---
That's why your here trying to convince people who are enjoying it? Fo4 is waiting for you dog. Go play with something you like.
---
... on second thought...
---
It's just a matter of time. The hackers just have to figure out how to circumvent the patch. Now that this hole in security is known, all *any* patch will do is buy a little time.
---
I am sorry dude I know the lengths you need to go for legendiers in this game
---
I mean, sort of. I developed mods and built levels in the original Unreal engine, and I'm currently transitioning to Unreal engine 4 after developing exclusively in Unity for several years, and one thing I can say with certainty is that the original engine compared to today's engine is like a small prop plane compared to a 747 jet airliner. Both fly, but one is significantly more advanced and capable of much more than the other.
---
And Creation Engine is a fucking tricycle.  
---
That is on fire.  
---
And radioactive.
---
They have! Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4!
---
I had a fucking blast playing this objectively HORRIBLE game with my HORRIBLE friends!
---
I am on xbox and it only happens with my lever action. No other gun that I have does this.
---
They could hire a hitman.
---
Not yet, but give it time...
---
No no, he’s explaining exactly how you actually are.
---
Stop enabling shady corporate practices.
---
&gt; lever action reload issue
---
that wasnt a bug the lever action was programmed that way
---
Thanks for the tip
---
&gt;I have First myself and it's ok - though you wonder how long the game will go on for.
---
As long as you keep forking over that cash, they'll never let you go. And that's not a good thing.
---
Probably less on fire than it was 11 years ago, but definitely more radioactive. And missing a wheel on that tricycle. But it has new paint.
---
Not gonna lie, I leave all of my resources open. If someone happens across it and scores then I must have been away from camp too long. In my eyes, it's better someone gets loot as it will always be collecting anyway and eventually max out. I know for me its always nice to have a nice tall glass or 5 of purified water when I visit another players camp. Fast traveling really makes you thirsty!
---
I hope they loose their data and their life
---
Genuinely hope you get robbed
---
And to anyone reading this comment i hope you know this game is terrible.
---
It's PC. Hacks happen in every game. Sucks buts that's the life sometimes. Game is fun. That's why we're all here.
---
I play on Xbox and yeah im having a good time. Much less bugs and no hackers compared to PC. So to me its a great game.
---
But  I do get why PC players are so mad and raged about the hacking and their inventory getting stolen. Its really bad. I hope it get fixed.
---
For decades, you got a product, and then a few years later, it was obsolete and you should buy the new one. There was a perception of total replacement until Microsoft and Adobe and what have you started with their subscription services.
---
about 210
---
It's not an emergency server side patch.  It's a surprise server rebuild.
---
How pathetic do you gotta be to wish someone genuinely hated a game and doesn’t have fun all because you don’t like it? Let people have fun. You stated your opinion, I stated mine, now you’re being ridiculous about the whole thing. 
---
Maybe you need a friend?
---
What do you get when you ban players who report hacking? You get what you fucking deserve.
---
as someone who got completely robbed it still feels a bit hollow.  They slap a bandaid on it and it doesn't sound like i'm getting any of my shit back.  Watch them go but heres 10 atoms.
---
You guys literally dickride this game and down vote anyone who talks about it negatively.
---
Here's a thought, maybe its just fallout76 fanboys downvoting you for implying the game is hackable or "bad in any way".
---
Awesome tesponse to a shitty act by a scum sucking hacker. 
---
You are 100% right, we all get sucked into the legendary hunt for items that 95% of the time aren't even needed.
---
Didn't they hire in ID to do the netcode?
---
This would fall under rule 7. If you see people who post things that are unverified. Or have no proof, report it. We can reach out and determine the truth of it.
---
Exactly. I hope those issues are resolved as well. I’m on Xbox, and it’s mainly just the server crashing sometimes. But it’s been getting much better.
---
We'll see, Jedediah. We'll see. Lord willing and the creek don't rise. Mmmmhmmm
---
For now, sure. But it's just a matter of time before the hackers figure out how to circumvent the patch.
---
I’m a pc player, so... that’s unfortunate.
---
But its not a "controversy", it was an actual event that occurred and reported by several sources; even the hackers felt comfortable showcasing the exploit. And not everyone uses Reddit, or actively seeks this type of info, so his vids are actually providing a service, disseminating crucial info to the general player base. Also what further investigation does he have to do? He already provides more sources than your average college thesis paper.
---
Give them time. I have faith in this game's ability to always get worse.
---
They just have to figure out how to turn giving items into a bad thing
---
Oof. Well I’m not Xbox, I for sure don’t have 210, maybe about 40-50. But if you’re on Xbox as well I will be more than happy to gift you tokens.
---
Oh fuck heavy ammo
---
I've had it happen on my pump once or twice but it happened more on my lever action.
---
That'll be a real "Happy learned how to putt! *Uh-oh*..." moment for sure
---
Agree
---
Are these problems affecting console gamers as well?
---
Its literally not though? It IS a general purpose engine. At least that is what its code base is, Yes they updated the lighting, stripped out 1990's netcode and jazzed up a few areas that needed it but it is still the same Subaru EJ engine underneath it all.  
---
Heres the thing as the decades move on the bread gets better the best ratios of flour water yeast and eggs are researched and practised.  
---
Engines improve, fuel efficiency, torque, size.  
---
We don't just take a engine and swap out the cylinders and call it a "new engine" (gamebryo to creation)  
---
We start from scratch, building on the unchanged fundamentals by /properly/ integrating new research.  
---
What Bethesda have today can't be blamed for the hacks. But it sure as shit is responsible for the now decades of version to version bugs that still exist in 76 from way back in 2002
---
actually this new BOS role I adopted is more fun now that I worked out the initial kinks. the game is actually better without my legendary.  not very hard even just a teeny bit more chllenging and fun. I have ran countless silo runs and queen fights. I am level 380 been playing since beta. pre hack I would zone out and do it in auto pilot even. nothing hurts you at all when you are rocking vamp ultracite laser gat. the fight is just tough enough now to be interesting without it being to tough its like the sweet spot of difficulty that I didn't even know I was looking for. in the long run I am better off now. I have a role I enjoy and adds another level of immersion for me. I am more engaged in combat. and I am still rich as crap. IF beth reimburses or returns my old gat I am gonna get rid of it just like all the others. in 3 queen fights yesterday plus doing fisure runs and testing my builds on legendary scroched I probably disposed of 20 ish legendaries. it feels good not putting them on the market. ech one is a little FU to every duper hacker ebayer and pay to winner in the game. ad victorium .
---
You say that like as if I don't want that to happen  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
No
---
Well then I'm still not interested in playing.
---
How pathetic do you have to be to dickride a game this horrible, to the point where several hundred people got robbed yesterday. 
---
You're the problem. Maybe you should get some non-digital friends?
---
🤔
---
That assaultron laser beam is no joke. It's the only reason I consider energy resistance.
---
In total the daily average is 20,000 to 33,000.
---
It's a few cases,but a major gaping wound in Bethesda's game.
---
It's got many glaring issues,but Tis merely a flesh wound!
---
I have been playing since beta and all my characters just have something horrific go wrong so I never make past 80
---
Yeah server crashing, and low frame rates in certain parts of the map.
---
Terribly fun
---
Soooo ur being robbed of your real life $ (FO1st) or your real life-span (hours put in you wont get back) dam bethesda got some evil super villain scheme going on since if I HAD to play I'd rather pay $ than lose weeks of time played. One of the rare times I'm glad I'm playing on a Xb1
---
LOL if ppl actually buying Fallout 1 bc of this, you actually rewarding Bugthesda with money. Is like the stupid thing to do. 
---
Best thing to do is shoot this game on the head, and with luck Bugthesda lose money on this game and just quit this stupid experiment and star making good game again
---
"Take a picture of the guy who's taking a picture with the camera he just stole from you while you were taking a picture of that guy"
---
me too I like public servers better I mainly use my private server in very small  bursts for very specific goals.
---
Yea some dude messed with me at my camp last week and I shot back. After he Merced me, he leveled my whole camp. I did try to seek revenge so he was still hostile so that's totally on me. I don't know if it removes camp damage if you just ignore after dying. Did suck to fix my fusion Gen and decon shower but whatever. I will not fight at my camp again and I suggest everyone else does the same.
---
Im pretty sure if a random teams you and shoots his buddy while at your camp, his buddy could then level your camp. I'm sure these types of raiders are very few however. Most of the time though when I get a random team invite, it's just somebody that's wants to quest with another player.
---
No it wouldn’t. Anthem’s devs were at least competent and caring enough to make sure you couldn’t just steal gear off the back of other players.
---
Anthem is absolutely an example of a horrible trend in games - FO76 and BGS epitomizes it, on its own merits.
---
None of this should be normalized. It’s one thing to admit you like something bad or broken or shady, however you want to conceptualize that - it’s another to insist it isn’t and normalize those trends.
---
76 does not exist in a vacuum and people pretending it does and there are not larger potential implications of its shoddiness and BGS’s have broader implications.
---
Just like “whales” in general. Yes, you’re free to dump all the money you want into mtx’s, but also yes if people do dumpna lot of money into mtx’s it will feedback on the way mtx’s are structured, or how games are designed to accommodate more mtx’s.
---
This should be obvious to people.
---
Looking at your history it seems every couple months you come back to harass 76 players. Get a life bro. There is a game out there for you.
---
Yes that is terrible that people were robbed and I hope very much that they are able to get their items back at full. But how is me saying it’s just a shit game all around going to get their items back? Reporting problems until it is resolved is a better solution than just saying a game is shit, and hoping MORE people get robbed. That is truly the more pathetic way of going about this issue.
---
Merry Christmas!! Hoping you all have a Happy New Year
---
hope some russian players find this hacker and beat the vodka out of him
---
we will never know unless and until someone internal spills the beans, and I'd love to hear all about it
---
600 Likes? Lol people swallowed that so easily. That\`s just sad
---
I'd flipping love that
---
Hmmm... let’s look at this logic...
---
Does your home have the latest security technology installed?
---
If not, and you get robbed, it’s your fault that your home was burglarized.  By extensions, it’s the fault of Police and the Government that they did not prevent the crime.
---
We are playing an online game on PC.  FO76 has a lucrative offline marketplace (some sellers are making $20k+ per month.  Unfortunately or fortunately) the game attracts many talented people - some of them more than rival staff employed by Beth.
---
We chose to “live in this neighborhood”.  Deal with the risks. :)
---
You can turn that loss into motivation, become a nude vigilante. Bring tidy whitey justice to the wasteland.
---
Yep. When a player uses a map, their teammates will also get loot if they are nearby the dig. And you can pretty much spam the button to use maps on the same dig.
---
Because the sub exists.
---
Your analogy is odd. You're comparing an entire game engine (the whole) to a literal car engine (a part of the whole). Since your initial comparison is flawed, everything else following sounds flawed. Make a different like-for-like comparison if you're looking for a response.
---
That's not that hard, they'll just spawn  the most legendary and OP items and give it to you, then report you for cheating
---
You as well frendo &lt;3
---
Fallout 3. New vegas, 4 are single player versions with more content. The whole point of this game is the multiplayer. Every other fallout game does single player 100x better.
---
You giving Bethesda more money and service empowers a shit institution and company. Nobody should play this game period. 
---
Yea omg why didn't anyone think of reporting all these bugs :) I'm sure 76 would've been great within the first month if people just reported it. 
---
How does one get cucked by a digital game...
---
hey kid sorry some asshole did the internet equivalent of kicking you in the nutsack here's 5 internet dollars
---
Tinfoil hat says all these "hacks" were inside jobs, to provide problems for paid solutions.
---
Sir I’m sorry I pay 80 dollars for something to work I get what your saying but there is difference between some hacks like nuclear winter and this the can just click on you and boom all of your stuff gone with no way back so your logic is pretty flawed your self
---
Sounds like the old rumors the dupers spread that they were being banned unfairly
---
The entry point for pretty much everything you've been seeing lately is gone.  It's not like they just move two squares to the left and do it again.  It's not nearly that simple.
---
This whole situation was a screw up.  These hacks have been around a *long* time, but people were (mostly) quietly toying with it for specific purposes.  But someone put out a little too much information, and the script kiddies figured it out and ran amuck.  And they know they made that mistake.
---
The authors of these things know what the hell they're doing, and they'll figure out other ways to accomplish what they want to do.  But what they *don't* want is the attention.  They screwed up by letting the info out too much, which is why you suddenly saw problems where there weren't any before.  When the kiddies started causing troubles, the original guys (either directly or indirectly) provided BGS the solution to the problem (maybe they already knew the solution, I'm not sure).
---
None of that is particularly secret, not now anyway, you can go research it yourself if you like.
---
Sounds like you need the tinfoil suit, my friend! Only 800 atoms in the atom shop! Now you too can pay for those problems
---
Nah more like removing your nuts with a 12g
---
It more like paying for the security it failing then you get nothing in return of being robbed
---
I've been experiencing this occasionally for a while myself. I use sprint to break out of it.
---
Legendaries stop spawning...?
---
Did you seriously not understand a damn word he just said?
---
You are enabling their predatory behavior and normalizing anti consumer practices, as consumers, which has effects beyond any individual game. 
---
I’m sure all of us are subbed to this community because we *did* play the game and eventually fell off over time as we stopped lying to ourselves about what was going on. 
---
If you want to dig back to beta, you’ll find me defending the game I bought 2 copies of on pre-order.
---
We realized we got scammed and no, don’t just ignore the cancer that this game ended up being.
---
"Hurr durr I'm fucking illiterate"
---
No shit hacking is problem across all games even flash games
---
Barnacles, I only have enough for five eighteenths of the suit.
---
I already got you to acknowledge the fact that classes have access to unique abilities that other classes don't have right? If those abilities all existed in Skyrim or Oblivion, then a Sorcerer would be able to cast the little light spear that a Templar could. But no it's an MMO so things have to be class specific for balance purposes
---
You can add me.. I'm a chick if that matters. Gt Latershater
---
Like I said, whether you believe it or not I don't care. There are people that can indeed act like human beings and portray feelings differently through the way they react. We're all not mindless drones that must CONSUME.
---
If you really want I'll dm you my Gamertag if it is that much of a big deal to you. But I am literally one person you'll never know irl so why care?
---
Fallout 1st would've been a completely harmless thing if it were simply a cosmetic membership with exclusive costumes and the like. Hell, I'd still even pay for private servers if it meant it were a cheaper and a separate option but this is mostly a matter of principle to me.
---
Paying 12 or 13 dollars a month for an extremely flawed game is barely fixed and is seeing no light of day for polish is going off the deep end. Especially when some of the membership perks are rooted in deep lies.
---
Bethesda stated in tweets and interviews that they cannot increase storage capacity because of stability limitations. Now for 13$ a month you get unlimited storage for scrap which normally accounts for 60-90% of your storage most often times. 
---
TL;DR I could care less if whether you believe me. All you need to do is say the word and my achievement list will be yours. Fallout 1st and it's perks are a disgusting decision that is enough to make me quit this game outright despite all the time I spent with it. For better or for worse.
---
I'm on console but after this hack I'm thinking it's more conswole
---
You are still here? I thought you were busy taking an L.
---
Yes a very good boy 😒
---
And like I had said before, your opinion and toxic behavior/view isn’t going to change my mind. 
---
Wishing someone gets bad karma in a game simply for enjoying it? That’s sad.
---
&gt;which may have resulted in a few players losing items that their characters had equipped.
---
A serious understatement of the problem...
---
LOL
---
I understood what he was saying, I just dismissed them as nonsense unworthy of comment.
---
Hacking consequences were even more disastrous in Fortnite.
---
The backlash of players in the Division would make FO76 forum seem like a Kindergarten 
---
) I am sure if we visit any online game forum we will see similar problems
---
Rank 2 of them doesn't work properly I read somewhere, it doesn't trigger at least for the weapons, but 1 and 3 do.
---
Thanks for being that honest, people need to open the eyes sometimes, instead of closing them just because "Well I'll stop playing now, I'll play a few weeks later".
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they were under NDAs to prevent that from happening.
---
you are sooooo mistake my friend, i been playing WoW for 14 years, and if you get hack you can get your stuff back in less that 1 day since they can track your items and items and gold. 
---
This shitty game dont have anything like this that why ppl that lose EVERYTHING they still dont have a answer. 
---
This game is a shitty game make bad a once great company that is a shitty money hungry companie now.
---
Just like Wargaming and the Pay2Rico "free christmas gift" that you actually have to shill out between $200 and $300 in ingame currency in order to have a chance in hell of obtaining. Funny thing about that, is that the whales and the corporate fanatics defending Wargaming (or turning a blind eye to the corporate greed) are actually starting to turn against them for that complete nuclear dumpster fire of an ingame event.
---
Your clearly just Bethesda fan boy who uses other minor examples as evidence when I said yes those happen
---
next time I talk smack about pcmasterrace remind of that time I got hacked lol.
---
No doubt.  I enjoyed the shit out of the pvp in that game and the environment was goofy as shit.  It was so early in the mmo days that it was basically a blank slate and people like me were figuring out all the funny stuff you could do in game.  From ghost resing onto a horse into someone’s home to using purple potions on the vendors to luring in a horde of monsters into town then watching the chaos unfold or just using emotes to trick people into attacking you in town, UO was buck wild.
---
All I had meant was that reporting bugs and cheaters is different than just being all around toxic about the game and the developers. 
---
Toxicity can have a toll on everything after a while. 
---
I’m not saying we have to worship the game, that’s just ridiculous. But (in my own opinion) being extremely toxic towards this game isn’t really going to help things all that much. 
---
Helpful feedback is what they need. Not the literal threats I’ve seen people spewing.
---
I am literally only here because I asked for a refund when I realized the game was totally broke and they had no idea what they were doing, BGS told me to go eat shit.
---
I just wait for the next big fuck up and all the fanboy freaks to excuse it. It is absolutely satisfying and fascinating watching them get blackpilled on the game over time - the delusions and weird ass identifying with a corporation that has nothing but contempt for you just slowly crack under the weight of their disregard.
---
I get disheartened when I have to restart a game because my own meddling broke it. I suffer through that enough on Rimworld when I break it myself. 
---
If someone else can come along and destroy my game and force me to restart because of a security flaw or a crippling bug that I did nothing to cause, I uninstall the game and never look back. It is straight up inexcusable and indefensible. 
---
I bought the power armor edition and regret every penny of that. Every time I think about hopping on because maybe something changed, something like this happens. I do not believe this game will ever be worth the price of admission.
---
oof, i just did that one a couple of weeks ago on my main. it was so sad. for all of bethesda’s faults, they can craft some compelling stories when they put effort into it. the mistress of mysteries quest got me, too :(
---
very probably. at best we might get an anonymous AMA on 4chan or something. but man, you know the devs know how much of a shit mess this game has been. i wonder how they and the management have dealt with the stress and backlash over time.
---
:))) minor examples ?
---
Before resorting to name calling... do your research... Google is a great invention 
---
To be fair... I am at present a FO76 fan boy - it’s my go-to game
---
Amen! I have said this since day freaking 1. And I get flammed and downvoted to hell.   
---
As someone who has run game servers, and had to learn to modify code in order for them to be stable / more enjoyable, I completely agree with what you have stated here.
---
Thank you 😊
---
hacks
---
I asked for community breaking hacking like most cod games after 5-6 years not oh this kinda hurt the community
---
Only thing that's toxic is this game, and you for supporting this train wreck. 
---
The boots already spotless buddy, no need to keep licking...
---
LOTD is honestly pretty garbage if that's the only thing keeping your weapons from deteriorating, never tried lucky break. I run 5\* Gunsmith and 2\* White Knight most of the time and just use repair kits from Queen kills.
---
lolol yeah it's not always so great. "I can mod this game however I want!" "OH NO SO CAN THEY"
---
Me to great game
---
I don't think you can craft buffout at all. I don't even think you could craft it in fo4 either.
---
We do keep in touch, and we have tried other games, but we always end up going back to fallout
---
Mmm I do love self imposed RP...
---
I didn't say I have no interest in NV, just that it is not the bug-free experience the 76 critics like to make out. I can tell you're one of the people that hasn't played 76 in months but still like to bitch and moan about it, because the world is far from empty. . In its current state it's still a good game and far less buggy and glitchy than New Vegas is after almost a decade of bug fixes. If you get hacked on PC that's your own stupid fault for playing a game from a series reknowned for its issues on PC instead of a console.
---
Vault dweller xXx_dickbag69_xXx has invaded your world!
---
I enjoy time sink games too. But such games actually should reliably protect the things you earned by playing them. And judging by Bethesda statement, they don't even have logs to see what was stolen, so they cannot give it back.
---
If the hackers really cared about proving Bethesda fucked up, they wouldn't have to go after the players. There's plenty of stuff they could do without taking people's gear. This is purely a "fuck you" to anyone willing to play the game, at all. Proof? Every single comment chain in the youtube videos, and people replying to articles with stuff like, "Anyone that still plays this shit of a game deserves whatever they get taken from them."  Gimme a break.
---
they put them as variants of the same object and capped them at 1 max. IIRC it was last patch, or the one before that.
---
Ok, I'll bite. Why?
---
Wait, what quest is this? I don’t remember it.
---
Because main quest line is way too short to be a single player game.
---
If there is it is unknown to the people who made the first one, because they have no workaround right now.
---
I will tell you what you won’t get. Any fallout 1st sales. They have yet to offer a single one.
---
How the fuck are they mistaken if you're admitting that people in WoW have gotten hacked and needed someone to get their shit returned?
---
With the exception of everyone who lost their items in the Vault 94 raids who got everything back of course. But you were thinking of..?
---
Thank you for this post (seriously)
---
As a result of our conversation, I Googled the state of hacks on other online games... and that was an eye opener.
---
Accounts hacked, personal data stolen, cheat bots, crashes...   It seems that we at FO76 are fairly well off
---
Bwaaahaaa!
---
Just a matter of time before a new version of the hack hits consoles too. Douchebags want it and are working on it
---
Unsolved best of intentions
---
Who cares about fallout first dude. Ask bethesda to at the very least restore their characters
---
Thanks for wasting your time writing out this post and mine for reading it. Here have a cookie! 🍪
---
It's basically the entire business model for most free-to-play games, where the bulk of revenue comes from a small number of whales spending absurd amounts, effectively subsidizing the free players. 
---
Sometimes you'll also see the term "dolphin" referring to moderate spenders.
---
Dunno if that's possible though my guy
---
If you're in console, I'd buy it now. You'll get enjoyment out of it
---
Pretty sure it's breaking both national and international laws.
---
Sorry bud, but I'm gonna have to take this with a rather large canister of sodium chloride and continue with my nude colonist rp; my faith in you fixing anything long term is on par with that of a rehab center's faith in a meth addict breaking their addiction.
---
"huh huh huh h-hey Bethesda, just use a new game engine!
---
No problems with the game over here. I really enjoy it and I’ve never had an issue that’s stopped me playing it. 
---
It’s a pity so many people are influenced by what a few greedy click bait you tubers say instead of just playing, so many people are missing out on a really good game imo.
---
It got bored with stealing peoples inventory and wanted more attention so posted here.
---
The smaller maps were amended for the moment. So even with 20 people we still get full maps.
---
The previous experience of the 76 developers includes:
---
Knights of the Old Republic
---
Star Wars: Galaxies
---
Ultima Online
---
These are people who know how to design, engineer, code, and manage a successful online game. So I have to ask, how could that collected pool of talent make the Fallout 76 that we ended up with?
---
Simple: all of those games had publishers lined up to produce the product, and a lot of money to develop it along the way.
---
Bethesda self-published, and seemed to be working from a budget garnered from bake sales.
---
That's what he was implying.
---
A crime is still a crime. You're still breaking the law if you steal a car that was left unlocked with the keys in the ignition, regardless of the owner's lack of common sense.
---
Most online multiplayer games have never allowed this level of hacking, those that did at one point have these kinds of issues  usually dealt with them a helluva lot better than Bethesda.
---
My worst experience is someone putting up racist signs on my camp that I didn’t find right away.
---
I just killed three legendary scorched beasts while fighting ghouls at the club house while in standard armor, I won, so I'm OK thanks.
---
I seriously doubt ANY one working on this game was happy to ship it without NPCs.
---
Depends. 10 xp per down, 20 xp per kill. So If I kill 6 or more people I have already earned my placement xp + It was more fun to do It.
---
Yes, it's my fault. I fell down the stairs.
---
It's "authoritative."
---
The notes left in the responder hall at the funeral home made me really sad too.
---
Its been minute.
---
*bethesda joined the game
---
anyway around it?
---
&gt;value your own time
---
Take your own advice and stop trying to shit on people who like a game you don't like.
---
You say that while the downvote says otherwise.
---
You don't even play this game so excuse me if I don't give a shit about your opinion.
---
Congrats
---
Solution:  
---
* Good anti-cheat for beth servers, bug bounty for future exploits  
---
* Community ran servers with the ability to disable the anti-cheat and install mods with their own save files
---
not really a catch 22 since there are definitely options, they just don't want to take them
---
Wah has changed. 
---
It's no longer about paid mods, atom shop items, or Fallout 1st subscriptions. 
---
Its an endless series of proxy servers, fought over by hackers and BGS developers.
---
You dont need to be a CEO to tell Bethesda is doing a terrible job.
---
Exactly my sentiments, I have bought 1st so I'm an evil whale but I'm having loads of fun playing in my own world, I paid my money and I'm enjoying the product I purchased.
---
I was playing in Adventure now and then but it's not issue just living in private, no crashes, great smooth game play at the moment and loads of Christmas presents and cheer, not to forget all the jolly 😁
---
The Division is a RPG. The game is beautiful and the build are diverse. The publisher is Ubisoft. On console the PvP game is fun, but in PC you find a lot of hackers.
---
In fact, a RPG is prone to this because the serves don't check a lot of data. Although that data is serve checked for competitive fairness in a lot of shooters.
---
A lot of MMORPGs have this issue. Even WoW currently have bots and duppers.
---
Keep in mind, a account hacking is banned by Bethesda. Hackers don't care. That are kamikaze accounts. 
---
The problem is someone is investing a lot in this. In Christmas. That person is not with his family, away from work and having the IRL time with his love ones. No. He is buying accounts.
---
Of course, if Bethesda wanna be a developer for PC they must invest in fighting hackers. And for a single player studio is obviously a big task. We only can wait.
---
Nope, cap is at 1. I perosnally would prefer having 2 mothman smoke machines up BUT "dem the rules"
---
small number? there is a youtube video of 1 just 1 guy doing this to over 500 people
---
LOL 🤣
---
So glad I dodged this dumpster fire.
---
&gt;blind
---
&gt;fanboying
---
I've thought about rival companies, but I think it is predominantly bored chan anons who find 'Todd Howard' to be memetically sticky enough to justify their times. The alt accounts to practice the exploits probably were created during the free week, and given the ease with which information about large amounts of the source code are available from years of Creation Engine modding, it's likely just skilled assholes
---
Aw, you're so angry someone likes a game you don't lol Pathetic.
---
Fire Todd Howard and I will take you seriously. Heads need to roll. Big heads with small brains who insist on using a 25 year old game engines and are incompetent con-men.
---
Question is... are those Developers still with the company? Lolz...
---
I'm really sorry that you feel the need to support this, and that you have nothing better to do then to police how someone else spends their time and chooses to enjoy themselves. That sounds like a pretty sad way to spend your time. I hope you're able to find a hobby one day. :(
---
&gt;pay to winners
---
You keep saying this, what did they buy, unless you mean eBay?
---
its PR for private servers?
---
"Don’t cry about the game being a technical mess now"
---
Practice what you preach.
---
It might need some lotion
---
People called in to work on the dumpster fire they created? Oh no...
---
Bethesda were warned about these hacks and chose to ignore it, thinking they knew best. Clearly they don't.
---
Luckily for us. If hackers managed to steal it. All we see are genderless characters from below. Haha
---
You can do both weapons on a rifleman build so you can be bloodied rifle or bloodied commando I did both I got a be lever and bloodied blackpowder rifle for rifleman and a bloodied handmade and bloodied Combat rifle for when I swap to commando

The critical multiplier varies weapon to weapon. I have tested several weapons, but have yet to do a proper write up on it. Generally, the cheaper the AP cost, the lower the base multiplier. A 10mm or pipe has around a 50% base crit multiplier. Handmades, assault, and similar rifles are around 60%. Something like a harpoon gun was slightly over 100%. 
---
It is difficult to get clean numbers through testing. From what I understand, the game does not round numbers, it only displays the last value reached. For example, if you deal 15.9 damage to an enemy, the game will only display 15 damage dealt because it is just short of 16 damage. Ever had zero life after a fight? This is further evidence that the game will not display a whole number until it is at least that. You could have between 0.1 and 0.9 life and the pipboy says you have 0 life.
---
No, they used the netcode from Quake that Id made.
---
Well said. People forget the Devs are just human's doing they best they can in the situation they are in.
---
Do you guys have Cyber Security people? Unencrypted client/server traffic, no 2 factor, etc. Might be time to bring someone in and find/fix your issues.
---
That's what they get for not doing things right the first time.
---
They brought this upon themselves and will get no sympathy from me.
---
I think I'm getting 500-600 for surviving till the last 10 and not killing anyone. But I might be wrong...
---
LOL 🙄
---
Um... are you not aware of how many people made thousands selling 'mod lobbies' and such on the previous gen of consoles? Consoles will *not* always be safe. We can thank SBC like the Raspberry Pi for the current lull in PS4/XB1 progress but hard to say how things will play out with the next gen of those consoles, like Nintendo's Switch is completely compromised because it offers something the current SBCs don't or can't.
---
That's ... a pretty outstanding resume for online gaming.  
---
I would love to know what the fuck happened in there.
---
I doubt it very much. Bethesda has had bugs that run through multiple games. Hell, the fact that it's basically an asset flipped fo4 shows they were all doing the bare minimum. If they haven't wanted to put more effort in before, why would they now?
---
To me it seems they got complacent releasing buggy games and letting the fans fix them, cant do that with fo76 though as its online so the bugs are more prevalent than ever.
---
just google any legendary weapon on google you will see sites where you can buy them for cash. how do you think so many pvpers have legacy tse explosive lasers. trash weapons for trash players.
---
At least I’m safe inside my mind
---
There's a big difference here. The scum responsible for those were sued for copyright infringement. These scum are, at least in the United States, violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, specifically "the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally causes damage without authorization, to a protected computer;", where damage is defined as "(8) the term “damage” means any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information;".
---
Stopped playing in solidarity, or stopped so you don't get hacked too?
---
I like corn. But I'm not going pock the corn left in my shit just to eat more corn.
---
Well, that's because the more severe issue is the bug in the hackers' moral code.
---
I thought the guys that made Ultima online made this game?
---
Here is 500 atoms -Bethesda
---
The PR dude spouted many lies, and noone wrote a script for him. 
---
He is just as complicit as the rest.
---
Well, the engine is not awesome. Not for MP.
---
This \^
---
I really got fed up with all the people running about in (my opinion) silly dumb costumes, goat heads etc, it just didn't feel like a post apocalyptic world, but in Fallout 1st I'm on my own with only robots for company, holotapes to remind me that other people used to live in the world, but I'm now surviving in a barren world and I love it.
---
I like my empty private world, but I can join Adventure to take part in the public events and if I need to visit player vendors for specific items, I like having a choice.
---
Nah... I now live mostly in my private 1st world. Suits me as a solo player much better.
---
Roughly 20% of this sub are accounts and dupe accounts that exist just to crap all over the game. And you're welcome :)
---
Many "dubious YouTube personalities" have videos of it happening.
---
These clowns can't even make a secure web page.
---
I could live with that for the good it would bring.
---
Also all online games get hacked. That's one of the many reasons PC gaming is inferior in my eyes for these kinds of games.
---
Im also looking for people to play with and just chill out. Mind me adding you?
---
I'm not sure it will be.   
---
The thing which concerns me most about this most recent hack is Bethesda had several days of advanced notice plus the code but still didn't patch until after the hack was released in an easy-to-use form. 
---
Hackers will come and go -- that's just people being crappy people. But if a company is given a lot of notice and the tools that are going to be used and still don't act to protect their customers, they don't have a great understanding of running an on-line service and that's worrisome.  
---
OTOH, if you enjoy the game, play it. There's no real point in not playing.
---
Im Trippypanda880
---
Although I'd almost rather people attacking an idea of an engine rather than people, misinformation of that degree always bites you in the ass one way or another.
---
What hopefully all of us can agree on is there's a horrible cocktail here of elements that lead us into each and every pitfall the company as a whole should've seen coming miles away. It really is sad to see the pedigree of Fallout being treated so poorly. I'm sure the devs worked hard and did their best, but there's just so many issues that simply shouldn't have happened in a modern online experience.
---
TIL pointing out all the various faults in a game is a bad thing. Sounds like you just dont like when people criticize what you like, as you result to insulting these people with "cameras their mom bought them".
---
Do you think there would be so many people reporting on the countless flaws if the game was actually decent, and not just a broken cash grab?
---
And I do own the game, I stopped playing when they started selling repair kits. Every youtube video posted issues that were consistent with what was happening at the time, so it's not like their claims are baseless.
---
&gt; I honestly think that 24,801 XP for all the items is too much
---
It is. Especially during the Holidays where most people are away or with family. It’s a unhealthy and bad design direction.
---
The exp requirement to get timed NW items have also gotten worse over time. It was 7k for VTU, then 14k for Halloween, now 27k... Yeah no thanks. No amount of shoving down my throat will make this mode enjoyable for me.
---
Basically they looted players like containers.
---
what this hack served as was a wake up call to the fact that legendaries are the root cause of all thats broken in 76, so I am BOS now and do not use them, hack me again take my things, I will get a screen shot and you lose a smurf account for easily replaced vanilla gear. the game is far better without legendaries anyway thank you for your unintended positive consequences. playing as BOS with vanilla weps  is much more enjoyable and I get a great sense of satisfaction destroying legendaries now. I am super immersed in my new role and consider each weapon I scrap a FU to every hacker, duper, pvper, ebayer, and pay to win player in our community. 
---
what this hack also did was push me so far into beths corner you will never wedge me out of it till beth herself shuts down the servers. 
---
" value your own time &amp; money more and support better titles " there are no better titles. its a bland market full of copies of copies of games. fallout is the only original content I am interested in. not only that. You don't get to tell me what to do . you cant pick my games you cant pick my movies, you cant tell me what to say or how to say it. hack my account I will buy another, delete my character I will restart, steal my crap I will just make more, this is my fucking Appalachia and I do not give a flying fuck what you and others think about it. 
---
I have the system down now, hackers lose, they cannot stop me from progressing, no matter what you try I can be back up to kicking endgame in the nuggets in 2 days from a fresh character.
---
Players - All our stuff has been stolen!
---
Bethesda - You can now buy resource packs from the atom store!
---
do the words "Bethesda" and "Nice" still go together in a sentance without the word "not" ?
---
Why do I keep seeing these types of posts from people that have never once even commented on a fallout sub before?
---
I do, but when the argument is such nonsense, it's a waste of time to present them. It's like arguing with flat earthers. You know they're committed to their position and that no evidence will sway them, so instead you just move on with your day and find something else to do with your time.
---
Except for the fact that generated 3* legendaries are not distinguishable from legit ones, so only the obviously overpowered ones were removed. 
---
Is ignoring the warning videos people posted "acting in a relatively fast fashion"? Seems to me they just ignored it thinking they know better.
---
Dear Bethesda,   [/u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann/), [/u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek/) 
---
The problem is not that you have security holes. The problem now is that we are simply afraid to play. Yesterday, a cheat appeared, allowing anyone to undress our characters. Who gives us a guarantee that a cheat will not appear tomorrow, allowing hackers to change the legendary properties of our weapons? You create patches to cover holes, but how many more undiscovered holes do you have?
---
As long as your safety concerns related to dupes and spawn items, this could be tolerated. But now, for example, I'm afraid to enter the game. It’s easier for me to find another project that has no such problems.
---
"Do they think virtual currency grows on trees?!"
---
I'll up vote you truth teller
---
this is the link to the hack my fellow dwellers  [https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-fps-games/363438-fallout-76-weapon-editor-multihack.html](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-fps-games/363438-fallout-76-weapon-editor-multihack.html) use it wisely
---
&gt;it's a waste of time to present them
---
Not as much of a waste of time as to try and prove that "i just dont wanna provide an argument, but I definitely have one!"
---
dude its Bethesda of course they will fuck it up
---
I still haven't gotten my rewards for the past week.
---
\&gt; Knights of the Old Republic   
---
Games that rely on the competence of writers because honestly, the mechanics sucked and the implementations were clunky at best.   
---
Unless you meant the MMO, a subscription game that went P2W within 1 year of release, with the Star Wars name no less.  
---
\&gt; Star Wars: Galaxies   
---
A game that lasted for a while because there was literally nothing else, which was a huge grind and honestly not a lot of players.  
---
\&gt; Ultima Online 
---
A 2.5d game that actually employed backend programmers.  
---
Having experience doesn't mean you know much or that you're even good. In some cases, it can mean you got carried or work for cheap. I work with programmers that worked on AAA gaming titles (network code) in the past and they have trouble making a functional UI using html and javascript. So if they took front-end guys and gave them back-end stuff, it's why you have so many bugs.   
---
However, I think they know who is good and who isn't quite as skilled and those who are skilled I strongly suspect are working on ES6. Given how bad the bugs that get released are, I would be surprised if the team lead has 5years programming experience. There's no way a competent team lead would put his name on such frequent releases with so little testing.
---
without mayor changes in gamestyle or farming routine the repair intervals have definitely increased on my end.
---
my balisticf stash went down from 150something to around 80.
---
obv perks to save materials is the way to go, nonetheless repairintervals have decreased noticeably. ps4.
---
A free month of a free product that costs them nothing to manufacture seems like a bit much?
---
someone is mad, his game is a pile of shit
---
Are you on PC? Was you afk? You could be victim to the latest of hacks where people can just open your inventory like a container, stealing all your precious goodies.
---
A new hack was released that allows people to steal everything from any players inventory. Bethesda hasn’t bothered to fix it or even at least pull down the servers. Whether or not they’ll own up to their fuck up and compensate players isn’t clear yet.
---
Yes I do play on pc
---
No I am not afk
---
probably hacked, read further into the forums we got hit hard on pc.
---
Hackers are supposedly working on a way to get into peoples private servers.
---
This is my fear right now. If they can remove items from my pack, they can put items there too - and if those items are tied to a script, then God knows what that introduces to my PC.
---
RIP anyone who has a credit card on file with Bethesda.
---
there was a hack that allowed people to steal other people items. it was a 3rd party injector, not like the duping and other exploits. it was supposedly patched today. 
---
since you lost your items, you'll need to submit a ticket with bethesda support. they said they are "looking into" ways to make things right with people who lost their items. we dont know what that will be, most likely a rollback to an earlier backup of your character.
---
Glad I stopped playing that pay to play Bs, besthesda be lying like a mf
---
What do you mean localized details? I heard it says CPD for Charleston police department to make it more lore friendly.
---
I can’t find a recent-enough vid that shows the ranger variants.
---
Thanks for telling me
---
The thing is, I’m not really interested in a long-term subscription. That’s why I’m looking into the cosmetics.
---
;-;
---
&gt; I work with programmers that worked on AAA gaming titles (network code) in the past and they have trouble making a functional UI using html and javascript
---
So you're saying you've worked for employers who hired unskilled programmers? duuuude, press pause here.
---
Decals, it's exactly as you said.
---
What do you mean?
---
It's not hating on a game when its legitimately bad. And I bought the game way back when so its interesting to see how little has been done since I stopped playing, but much more monetization has been added.
---
You mean you didn't pay for the game? I certainly paid for mine, the full $60+ for the BETA experience, the BETA that was meant to help "test their servers and squash some bugs" (their words, not mine).
---
Oh! Thought you said details, not decals. My bad :-)
---
The kid that said his dad blamed everything on him. Mofo dad better be in wastelanders, cause I’m gonna pop him the second I see him.
---
Great logic idiot

Nuke it from orbit.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
I couldn't. you're not doing anyone any favors by taking such extreme measures.
---
not to mention it'd wouldn't do this sub any good. one because you can just come back with an alt and two because it'd only devolve further into a circlejerk of "Bethesda can do no wrong" and people could use this rule so silence dissent.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I just spend half an hour detailing the events that occurred, long story short I had all my inventory stolen. I found videos publicly outing this hack, and now I'm absolutely fucked. I have nothing I can do now, no gear, all my cosmetics I paid for with real money are gone. And when I make a thread about it, it gets promptly removed? Are you fucking serious?
---
They cannot keep you from spawning in Atom Shop stuff.  
---
Hence, they have to have you on a server.
---
&gt; As a server programmer you should know it is hard to distinguish incompetent devs from competent devs working under incompetent management.
---
As a game designer... well said.
---
How about stop deleting threads with information regarding this issue and their ticket not being addressed. How is this legal? I paid for shit, and it was quite literally stolen.
---
You mean the glorified escape rooms right?
---
Close your mouth when eating the devs dicks, its rude to have your mouth open.
---
&gt;wild Appalachia was the team firing on all cylinders.
---
Fallout is dead then.
---
I got hacked, I adopted the role of BOS and made it my mission to boycott all legendary weapons, they are the root of all duping, hacking, and pay to win players. I adjusted my build and found endgame content is more fun with vanilla weapons. its a very good game when you aren't being carried by a god gun.
---
for me I am now perfectly safe. even If I got hacked again I could just replace it and get a screen shot of the recent tab. a chance to get a hacker banned is totally worth a few vanilla items in my book, so I say bring it. please give me a lead for beth to follow up on.
---
honestly if you are here and wringing your hands over controversy and seeking validation from a bunch of forum users you aren't really a fan anyway. either you want to play or you don't. pretty simple equation.
---
Wait what? Why would Bethesda put in anti-cheat when people are willing to pay for it in it's current state?
---
They brought down the servers and fixed it earlier today.
---
It would be kind of cool if they did put him in. Its way too far out there though. 
---
Imagine it with me anyway.... 
---
Little side quest "retribution day" 
---
Using those random letters and npcs to locate said father whos gone off to be by himself... Hints that he might be "sick".
---
Finding him while youre super angry for what he did to the kidn like most of us would be. 
---
Come to find him worse off than the kid. Karma style. Like he realizes everything hes screwed up because hes turning into a scorched and his legs have him stuck in bed while he slowly petrifies or some shit. 
---
You wind up learning from him what the actual people go through during petrification and can either put him out of his misery, or leave him alive to suffer while people in the new town study him. Lol. 
---
Little twisted but i dont think its out of line.
---
No, because everyone getting it because hackers are assholes doesn't seem like a reasonable reason to give thousands of players fallout 1st for a month. Not to mention what do you even gain from it besides a private server? Players are losing their whole inventories with weapons and armor they grinded for and people (who arent even getting affected by it) want fallout 1st as a "we're sorry" gift because there was a *chance* they could've got hit. 
---
Demanding fallout 1st while other players are suffering and losing hours of grinding is just greedy.
---
Bethesda wouldnt sell the rights to fallout unless each piece of lore was sold off as a microtransaction.
---
I think we have saw the end of the Fallout franchise.
---
few people? hilarious  
---
this is what you get for being lazy and using the stupid single player engine.
---
Some being a year and counting.
---
See isn't that possibly a double edge analogy though?
---
Firstly, I'll say obviously a game engine isn't a physical thing, but bare with me here.
---
Poor maintenance could put an engine in a state where say the cylinders need to be rebored. You can only do that so many times before...shes hooped.
---
Been stuck in my head since I read this earlier. Not being rude but I just don't think it's a very apt analogy.
---
Cool, so how is that relevant to the discussion?
---
HEY HEY, I worked under Haden Blackman on Starwars Galaxies at Lucas before they moved to the Presidio. Was not away folks rolled out that direction.
---
Same to you fellow dweller! Merry christmas!
---
&gt;Not to mention what do you even gain from it besides a private server?
---
I mean, giving players a private server to play on while Bethesda try to fix their incompetence is the least they can do. Private servers should have been a basic function but they found a way to monetize that too. If all you gain is a private server, why are you against them giving it out. 
---
They don't have to give people a months worth of atoms or anything, just making the game barely playable again would help those few fans still playing surely?
---
I don't think absolutely anyone on here thinks Bethesda can do no wrong. 
---
I think most of us are just intelligent enough to know that there's a lot of things that Beth actually may not be the one at fault for and that the flood of people who come into the sub who have never even played the game or played it for a week last November but still come.in for no reason but the shit stir. 
---
Being a troll doesn't actually make the bad things people do avoid punishment or accountability. On the other hand though, waves of false accusations does undoubtedly create an environment that silences the actual victims because they are easy to dismiss as being like all the rest.
---
If honesty was championed instead of backing the possibility of very scarce few inadvertently dismissed (of which let's clarify that there's absolutely nothing anyone on this sub can do for them anyway in the first place so they should be talking to support, not us)  then a lot more people would be able to rally behind the real legitimate stories that actually have proof and legs to move forward with. 
---
The problem isn't always just a lack of proof, but lack of clarity and lack of information and lack of effort.  People are inherently lazy and their own narratives unreliable.  Why should we support them when they're asking us to put in more effort than they did for themselves?
---
You get 3 weeks to do it, and each challenge can be completed in a single day.
---
hahaaa grats and ad victorium.
---
Well when you play awful games and support them you get what you deserve.
---
Lots of places report on it, but they get shot down as "haters".
---
I'm waiting for 2 hackers to get into a fight stealing each others gear back and fourth.
---
Great build! Very cosy. I wish I had gotten the fasnacht branch garland as well, but I missed out. Looks really good in your lodge.
---
" a few players losing items "
---
If you really were a server programmer, you would be smart to have already moved on from such a terrible product.
---
&gt;It's pretty sad that someone felt the need to make everyone miserable at Christmas.
---
Yeah, if only Bethesda could release a competent game noone would be miserable, but that will never happen.
---
I'd wager the hack has bought much happiness to those who are using it too. Good to see them entering the spirit of Bethesda and taking as much as they can with minimal effort.
---
You literally have no idea what you're talking about, so stop talking about it.
---
Lmao I hope you find a hobby one day you pathetic idiot, how does it feel being this low down and self-inflictingly starved for entertainment that you would try to enjoy Fallout 76, what is wrong with you?
---
You can bet your ass the hackers are trying to figure out how to join a console server with a hacked pc client...
---
Wastelanders has been the final shot as of months ago, assuming no more mistakes were made. Then came Fallout First, banning community helpers, this situation, and much more. There is no more final shot. Regardless of how Wastelanders turns out, this game is still as broken and buggy as when I played it DAY ONE.
---
Probably the only people left playing the game are on this subreddit, so I guess all the players already know?
---
Just get me his address, I'll handle the rest.
---
I'm not against giving players private servers till the hacking problem is dealt with.
---
I'm against giving everybody fallout 1st for free and all the stuff that comes with it because other players are losing their inventory. Players trying to benefit from others misfortune is appalling. How can people see players losing hours worth of grinding and be like "give me $15 worth of atoms please"
---
Raiding another players inventory seems like a pretty big deal. 
---
To be fair, most of the bugs that have been reported on by game journalists have been pretty dramatic. 
---
I don’t get why anyone wouldn’t write a story or make a video about bugs this big, especially when they’re connected to a beloved franchise and a massive publisher. 
---
I’m glad you enjoy the game but I think it’s a little odd to say journalists shouldn’t be telling people what’s going on.
---
Bethesda doing what Bethesda do; cut costs at any cost. 
---
There’s a reason why Bethesda is known for having buggy games, even if their devs are plenty competent.
---
The game has no potential, as modders cant fix the countless bugs like they have on most previous titles Bethesda bodge out.
---
"People like you". You mean people who can see every clusterfuck that's happened and call them out on it?
---
Theres a reason literally everyone who reports on the game calls it a terrible game, because it's the truth. It's not hating or trolling when it's all true.
---
Expect your personal information to be personally distributed to scammers next week and say "it's what fans like you have been asking for, you're welcome."
---
If the foundation sucks or if they're trying to slap together stuff into the engine it wasn't originally designed for it definitely will turn out shit.
---
You haven't played the game until you're able to go toe to toe with scorch beasts in the nude, using only vanilla knuckles and Born Survivor for healing (none of that weapon wheel, quick stimpak bullshit). Though they usually summon up Scorched so you can also use Cannibalism as well, plus I'm not opposed to having to open up inventory to access snacks. You'd probably want Lead Belly as well to avoid rad build up. 
---
Key to surviving their blasts is Fireproof, with Adamantium Skeleton to prevent cripple. And go for normal punches instead of power attacks.
---
85% Upvoted - am I to understand that those 15% have never been affected by any bugs or what because the negligence is just hilarious!? :D
---
So i guess we have to wait for...

Furious Meat Whip ⭐⭐⭐
---
Bashing damage increased by 40%
---
25% less VATS Action Point cost
---
Happens with my pump. Sprinting fixed it.
---
Worse than FO4 because there are no NPCs
---
Server crashing/rollback dupes haven't been a thing for months.
---
Bethesda changed the way they autosave, so these just literally don't work anymore
---
"... which may have resulted in a few players losing items that their characters had equipped. "
---
\- Bethesda, 24.12.2019
---
And people don’t get that the subscription services allow for the product to be continually maintained and updated, rather than scrapping it and coming up with a whole new program every year or two. 
---
I know *far* too many people who still complain about the Adobe suite even though you get a new release every year, PLUS patches/updates throughout the year. Not to mention the cloud storage and project collab abilities with others.
---
People aren't trying to benefit from others misfortune, I think they just want a way to play the game they paid for, and keep paying for.
---
To be honest, I think anyone that's asking for free fo1st isnt thinking about the atoms, they just want to play without fear of all their progress disappearing.
---
I didn't follow the game for very long. I knew that Raph Koster had a hand in it's design, and for that reason I jumped to the game on launch day. I enjoyed it until the moment my character found and item on a dead enemy that said that my journey to becoming a Jedi meant I had to to level up pole dancing in nightclubs to master level.
---
Uninstalled.

You have to be Gun Fu Panda
---
PvP in this game is for wankers.

Prepare to get downvoted.

Not yet
---
LMAO, yep. I did however love the unique nature of the tree's at the time, my biggest complaint at all times when working with senior dev's was each world felt so empty to me.
---
If 76 is the Titanic, the ship is already at the bottom of the sea disintegrated to dust, the ship residences were devoured by sharks, and the leftover particles reside in a constant nuclear testing zone.
---
The note in the graveyard behind Morgantown airport, from a son to his dead mother. :( Also awful.
---
You should be able to holster your weapon and then the robots stop will forgive you. Obviously if you destroy one that's different. Bit for accidently hitting one this would work.
---
The worst thing about RDRO is all the other players. They are the absolute worst.
---
Also the map is almost entirely devoid of anything to do. It's a glorified lobby where instead of pressing X to launch the next team vs tream PVP event, you have to ride a horse for 10 minutes to arrive at that X button.
---
No, but you players are actively encouraging Bethesda to do less work for more money. ES6 is going to be packed full of microtransactions and features to pay for, and you guys have enabled them to do so. If people rightfully criticize Bethesdas money grabbing tactics, they may be forced to make a game that actually works.
---
I dont care what tripe you play or pay for, but when it starts to make future games follow the same lazy path, then I care.
---
Not that I am aware of. But I don't have them to even try.
---
And that can be done by Bethesda working with the players who were hit, dealing with the hackers, and taking steps to prevent something like this from happening again. I don't understand why players who aren't affected want fallout 1st, not just private servers for the time being, but fallout 1st. That is trying to benefit from others misfortune
---
I have "existed" since beta long before I got fallout first. its a good game I like it with or without the sub. with the sub is more convenient though so I will be staying subbed. 
---
anyway further conversation is pointless you are quitting so good bye dont let the door hit you on the ass. o/
---
They already pulled down the servers and patched it. Your window for fishing for circlejerk upboats has passed
---
They did. It's called Fallout 4
---
I didnt know captain obvious played fallout 76,neat!
---
I would definitely give them some slack on account of this game definitely being rushed out to release.
---
Yeah, it's really bad that this happened, but we don't know what sort of restraints they had in development.
---
Where do you get those traps?
---
It’s very true. A good engine that is full of “if it’s stupid but works it’s not stupid” turns into a fucking nightmare to change because it can have far-reaching, unexpected consequences. Especially if the original devs are no longer maintaining the engine. 
---
It’s like when you get a used car from someone who is a garage mechanic and they did all their own work, but you find out that to solve the overheating issue the nimrod just cut the thermostatic valve off the flange and put the flange back in rather than, you know, find the source of the overheating and fixing *that*. 
---
Sure, by leaving the coolant flow unrestricted you’ve solved the overheating in high-temp weather, but now in cold weather the engine can’t close the system to reach the intended operating temperature and thus will dump excess fuel which in turn will kill the O2 sensors and the catalytic converter, as well as strain the fuel pump and damage the engine if it’s running too cold. Like say it’s 30F outside and you’re going 70mph on the freeway and your car won’t heat past 100F when operating temp is 165-210F. 
---
This may or may not have happened to my 2005 Nissan Altima that I bought used.
---
im not sure since im using a non english version of the game but you could activate subtitles to check it out :)
---
I believe the full quote is “Due to the hardened nature of this unit's exterior, the action `shake belly like bowl full of jelly` is unavailable at this time."
---
The only "compensation" the victims of this want is a rollback so they can have their stuff again. Atoms ain't it.
---
My wife is usually online aswell she got a little note book writes down all the scrap she gives me and I keep it safe 4 her in my box
---
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HEATHENS TAKE IT SLOW
---
WAIT FOR THEM TO ASK YOU WHO YOU KNOW
---
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES
---
YOU DON'T KNOW HALF OF THE ABUSE
---
It will never be 100% confirmed, this game has and will always be a mess.
---
maybe a new hack wave? one could only wait
---
&gt;And that can be done by Bethesda working with the players who were hit, dealing with the hackers, and taking steps to prevent something like this from happening again. 
---
We all know Bethesda aren't capable of this, most that will happen is they'll ask the hackers to write an essay on how they did it.
---
The reason players are asking for fo1st is because you cant get private servers any other way. If they had private servers for free they wouldnt be asking for first.
---
They're asking for a private place to play so they can actually play. That's not benefitting off someone's misfortune. 
---
I'm pretty sure you're the only one seeing these requests and thinking "They would be getting x amount of atoms for free?!" Maybe stop being so obsessed with the microtransactions?
---
Because it was taking the Ultima Online feature of 'early adopter land grab', they felt like they needed a LOT of land. Ended up with so much, that players didn't really bump into each other all that often after they reached high enough levels. Low levels always were in abundance in the starter towns, but eventually, you found yourself in the middle of nowhere running moisture farms and making droid parts in giant chest freezers outside of a cantina in the hopes another player might buy that part.
---
Truth be told, I miss sitting on the ground in that alley outside the cantina, repeatedly cranking out droid parts for players to buy.
---
some players were stealing stuff from others, maybe that was assassin gear?
---
Top quality burn there, well played sir.
---
It's not hard to hack in console games, just harder.
---
~~May the full might of the PLA rain hellfire on your disgusting capitalist squander~~ Merry Christmas as well stranger :)
---
Looks like someone isn't paying attention... This is a new thing that came out just 2 weeks ago. I'm not going to spread how it's being done, but here's a hint: https://youtu.be/eknfelhN31E
---
Link to the video?
---
Lol, you're wrong.. but okay. :)
---
Correct, there's plenty of other great games out there.
---
well I mean its that or your gear is stolen, which one is it?
---
Just say I like it, that's fine, it's your opinion. Yes I get it, you disagree with me, that's okay. No need to be rude. This is the exact kind of attitude on why I'm happy to leave.
---
FYI I too played it since beta and still enjoy it. It's a matter of principle why I am leaving.
---
&gt; If people rightfully criticize Bethesdas money grabbing tactics, they may be forced to make a game that actually works.
---
OK. "Rightfully criticize" Bethesda, then, and let people enjoy what they want without being demonized and blamed for stuff they are not causing nor responsible for.
---
That should be true of anyone who is trying to make a video about a subject, but FO76 has been bashed on for a while now for a lot of good reasons, you expect this to change just because one youtube 'personality' just happens to stop?
---
If you are going to go to the subreddit of a game and bash it's players at least use proper English xD
---
me and my wife's boyfriend are throughly enjoying it and will not have your petty insults thank you very much
---
LOLOL shit I can see that working! blocker, lone wanderer, dodgy serendipity just in case...  that sounds fun.
---
For what it's worth, they also had people from **id Software** incorporate (parts of) the Quake netcode into the game.
---
You can't actually hear it unless you know the subtitles because he tries to do an accent lol
---
Nah I figured it out. Internet issues. Service down in my area.....fantastic....😖
---
Okie dokie. I don't need to prove anything, the information is out there. I really don't care if you or anyone else believes it or not.  The actual point is that anyone who does stuff like this is hurting the game.
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted lol they did patch it. Currently the worst someone can do is add items to you inventory. Merry Christmas hope you wanted 100 fusion cores
---
I had enough points to shift my build around to do three silos and three queens.  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f19595c&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sg2p10e82em1eh2ep0c72cr0ic4ii0ip2s72at1l92ls2lm2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=BOS%20Heavy%20Natural%20](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f19595c&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sg2p10e82em1eh2ep0c72cr0ic4ii0ip2s72at1l92ls2lm2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=BOS%20Heavy%20Natural%20) 
---
no legendaries and since its brotherhood of steel no mutations either.
---
At least we have enough self respect and dignity that we don't have to go all around the internet and talking shit to people with different tastes... But if looking like a sad human being is your desired outcome, then keep being you.
---
&gt;I'd honestly stake my life that your average Skyrim modder knows more about the creation engine than your average Bethesda developer does. It shows. 
---
I agree totally. It seems they just got complacent over the years and just didn't bother. No new training, no groundbreaking ideas, just carried on the same and let the fans fix it each time.
---
It's cute you read something on the internet, but nothing on the internet is 100% accurate. It's all a mixture of things, shit management, shit programmers, shit code base.
---
Imagine spending time on a fallout 76 sub just to whine and complain about it.  #rockbottom
---
You know, I'm open to advices from decent people. That means I can happily ignore you...
---
Nuclear winter XP hadn't changed at all.
---
Yes it's not Bethesda's fault, it's your fault for liking nice things. You should've known better, it's ok though, you'll change so Bethesda will stay with you.
---
\^\^THIS!
---
I heard one hacker is supposedly working on a way to "boop" all six enemy players at once. A "sextuple boop", if you will.
---
if you want to take it seriously with "they all leave the vault the same day" the lore answer is probably that those with lower level just took longer to sleep off their hangover :)
---
ok then.....bye
---
Didn't the hackers release a video saying they would steal items, then actually steal items? I'd be inclined to believe them at this point.
---
They held their promise better than Bethesda ever did. It's clear these hackers know more about the engine than the devs too.
---
That truly sucks man.  I know most online games have paid items tied to the account.
---
you're great at coming up with excuses for their incompetence I'll give you that. they were tipped off of both exploits at least a week before it went live but couldn't be bothered to fix it. that on top of literally everything else that lingers from the beta and has been catalogued extensively, some of which are 5 minutes fixes in the creation kit.
---
your second paragraph is certainly one way to look at it. but my experience in this sub tells a difference story. if anything, people scrutinize every claim as it is. to this day lots of you still don't believe items can just vanish. and just yesterday, hours after the hack was confirmed, people still dismissed it as paranoia.
---
there's no need for this proposed rule as this sub is great at policing itself and silencing anyone that doesn't fall in line. plus Bethesda's support is all but useless and only investigates claims if you make a big enough stink in the sub.
---
I'd be quite interested in knowing whether this is actual knowledge about a method to get into people's private worlds, with a source attached to it, or whether it's just referencing the fact that the private worlds used to be open to everyone in a person's friend list, which was remedied by adding the option to lock the private world to your current team only.
---
Would you happen to have any further information on it, or is it just a "thing you heard"?
---
So wait when your house gets broken into, you're not going to be upset or call the police, you're going to say "well self, this is what we get for living near other people." and just let it go? By that standard, you might as well not have a door since then it'd be your fault it gets broken during a home invasion.
---
Small for the several billion players on their game at a time!
---
That's all the way back from when F4 was released.
---
I remember seeing a Twitter post from one of the ID devs calling it quite a challenge adding multiplayer to the engine.
---
They absolutely had ID retrofit the Creation Engine.
---
Digitally manipulating items is the same as physically attacking and robbing someone?
---
Did they also release a video saying they'll find a way to get into people's private worlds?
---
Holidays - the time when the border between naive greenness and trolling shitposts is blurring
---
No, the rabbit hole is infinite in this case and goes beyond everyones imagination. How can one studio fuck up so many things and people still eating their shit is unbelievable.
---
Oh good, last time I played the map was tiny and it was over so fast.
---
just because you dislike the game doesn't mean you should force your opinion on other people
---
The double standards of the gaming community. If this kind of hack happened to PoE people would instead praise GGG for how "quickly" it got resolved.
---
LOL I would no shit laugh my ass off if they gave me 500 atoms. I am subbed and get those atoms monthly and I recent got about 60 bucks more for myself and my wife, I had to get that red rocket sign, the idea of them sending me 500 atoms cracks me up lol. it would be like me giving my kid a nickle.. "good job cutting the grass kid" I did that a couple times just to watch his face lol.
---
Or games just being a finished product, but we can go with your answer.
---
209K is just people on the subreddit, not in game. And every time something bad happens more people join lol
---
If this hack was simple, why wasn't it here a year ago? The hackers mist have spent a lot of effort to make this. With such an effort they could make the hack for any other game... But 76 makes drama, so it was a juicy target.
---
These "little shits" seem to have a better grasp of the engine than bethesdas own staff though.
---
There has been statements of that nature yes, I believe it was covered on Yongs latest video, I will try to find a source for you now.
---
&gt; I'm a loyal 76 player
---
just SAD!
---
Hyvää Joulua to all the **nice** people in the Bethesda, Fallout and Fallout 76 communities.
---
The rest of you, I've got nothing.
---
I'd prefer simple text chat instead of dozens emotes...
---
Bold statement.
---
Hope they don't take it as a challenge
---
There’s an old saying “locks are for honest people” 
---
Seriously though... I am saying that “hacking happens”.  And, yes, as you point out, you should call the Police. You should complain to the government and safety standards should be improved 
---
I prefer being objective and not making this into another “FO76 is an absolute disaster”.  Hacks happen in all online games.  Now, thanks to the OP, I checked on hacks in other games ...  Reading posts here makes it seem like FO76 is the only game with such problems. What we have here is relatively minor compared to what happens in Fortnite, WoW and other games.  
---
FO76 has its problems... let’s just be objective
---
good job!
---
No bro, we are the victims, they are getting paid :P
---
Sorry guy, but just because your neighbor doesn't lock his door doesn't make it legal for you to walk in and take his stuff.
---
here we go lol
---
That will never happen, as Fallout “Fuck You” First is their single player mode.
---
This is pretty eh-ish. Its not so black and white. This issue is not engine related, but an older engine can be a nightmare. It all depends how well its been maintained and the changes catalogued during the years.
---
But lets be honest, its bugthesda.
---
You too my friend! !
---
Oh shut it. I couldn't handle 30fps and / or 720p even if it was given to me for free.
---
Yes it costs more, it's also a lot more enjoyable if you're not just super casual.
---
And don't get me started on the damn controllers.
---
Merry Christmas !
---
Hahahahaha
---
I love the WendiClaus. 
---
What video software do you use?
---
You’re over thinking it. It’s about teaching Bethesda a lesson for releasing a bad game
---
It's so unfair. He is, in seconds, undoing hours and hours of people's time and effort.
---
Can you recommend me one of those games, I'm trying to find an alternative but its hard
---
There's always these posts when something incredibly hilariously tragic happens with this game.
---
You love a bad game.
---
I am glad that I play on xbox and feel bad about the hacks going around on pc
---
The problem seems to be that Bethesda/Zenimax just got too big for its own good. If all these studios like Montreal, Austin and Maryland itself were pitching in and the game works as it does, then it means there was absolutely no nuanced direction or creative buffer personnel to say, "guys this is garbage, we're just churning something out for the sake of churning something out." Entirely corporate, it just seeks to make money to pay the bills of three or more studios.
---
&gt; for the sake of minimal effort and maximum profit
---
Neither throwing money at something, nor spending more and more time trying to make it better, nor even creating something from scratch, is guaranteed to give better results, though. Of this there are plenty of examples out there, even just in the game development world.
---
&gt; Bethesda chose for things to be this way
---
"Bethesda" isn't a person, though. There are decisions made on quite a few different levels in corporate structures such as the one of ZeniMax and Bethesda. However, fair enough, those decisions on those different levels did lead to the game we have right now.
---
&gt; And they should be held accountable for it
---
Which people specifically? And how should they be held accountable? And by whom?
---
&gt; A special shoutout to those poor players who have had their PAID FOR ATOMIC SHOP ITEMS stolen as well
---
I believe the Atomic Shop items are recipes, and typically pretty cheap to make ones. Are you saying the hack actually took away people's recipes as well?
---
i'd prefer the emotes since i think the pantomimic communication with all its flaws is a fun gameelement.
---
but in general a question:
---
is there no messaging on pc? i write with players all the time on ps4.
---
There's too many people pretending to be authorities while speaking from complete ignorance by using gamer buzzwords like "engine." It allows them to spread dangerous misinformation to uninformed other players who see those buzzwords and assume expertise on the part of the speaker. I think that's the gist of the point that the OP was trying to make, at least. I went around quashing a lot of new accounts popping up earlier today to make posts about how the hack spread to consoles... The toxic fear mongering was out of hand.
---
So why are you guys here and not over there? :P
---
Thank you!!!
---
At the moment I'm using OpenShot 😊
---
I might come off as insane and will let this go now but there was no reason for you to comment in this thread if all you were going to do was give me the finger and give me a condescending attitude with no good reason other than me making an argument not even involved with you. That peeves me more than anything. 
---
Jfc I even listed reasons why FO1st is bs and you're still blind to this crap Bethesda is pulling, it is downright fraudulent. I know I'll get dislike bombed for this but I really wish you people could finally pull the wool over your eyes and realize that Bethesda is selling obstacles to a broken product with obstacles they created and lied about and if everyone said no they'd take a few steps back. Look at Battlefront II.
---
I love this franchise and will continue to love it but with people like you populating FO76, I'm happy to stick with FO4 and the others. (To be fair you're probably really nice ingame, most players are, as was I, and that is the only redeeming quality)
---
Goodbye. Enjoy the bugs, hacks, and blunders and thanks for reinforcing my decision of leaving this misguided community (some of them at least, most are still alright).
---
I play because I enjoy the game. It sucks that it gets so much hate, and that people have decided to do everything in their power to take something fun and turn it to shit.
---
Didn't people in universe have to pay exorbitantly to get into the vaults, too?
---
Age means "nothing", depending how well its maintained. And lets be honest, no fucking hope there, its Bethesda, a company infamous for having the same bugs bleeding into newer titles.
---
I am 100% sure that at this point the Bethesda version of the gamebryo engine is an absolute nightmare to work with.
---
Not saying this is the issue here, its like you said. They needed server-side folk. If they do have competent folk working there, I seriously doubt it would take them more than a year to iron out this very important issue or at least make it nr1 priority internally.
---
Exe file has different file size, and my second client for my mule won't logon with the old file.
---
Safe to say there's client changes.
---
I've seen the cheater forums claim you can still plant stuff on other people, but not steal gear.
---
Guess they could grief people by overencumbering them, time will tell.
---
Because I have a gambling problem and the purveyor and legendary items help subside my urges. Because I like having an in game shop and building a new base everyday second day. Because i'm an explorer at heart and Todd Howard is my fathers fathers friend from another mother.
---
&gt; OpenShot 
---
Thanks! I have a few videos for CAMP builds and stuff, but it's literally just the recording software from NVidia and so the quality is crap and I can't do cuts or anything.
---
Self hatred and confusion, they want to punish themselves by spending time with things they think that hurt them.
---
i am growing more and more envious of Consoles by the day, i love my PC games but damn is online practically cancer :(
---
You're welcome!!!
---
For me... Destiny 2 is a Vault :)
---
Wait, you agree with everything he says, say he's right, but you don't like it because he's making money off of it?
---
Lol.
---
Don’t play but your responses are killing me 😂
---
Forum posts by the creators and users of these hacks say that it could be done from ~200m away. You could've gotten robbed from basically anywhere without even knowing there was another player in the server.
---
Nah bud, they fixed that earlier today. There's nothing major on the horizon right now.
---
These hackers aren't real hackers in the traditional sense. Your character data is stored on Bethesda's servers. These hackers have no access to that at all. They are manipulating only the client-side data, which limits the damage they can do.
---
"Rigth now the trust in the game is gone"
---
Mate what kind pf psychedelics did you take to trust this game for this long?
---
I shouldn't have to make clear that the game itself doesn't have feelings, criticizing it does not translate to insulting the developers of said game. Up until it does; then that is bad behavior.  
---
But I agree no one should threaten people period. It's all virtual assets and in reality it's not worth that effort to get a personal vendetta or seek out to threaten the people behind making it. But at the same time, much value has been placed on this game by the people who have stuck with it since launch, seeing it as something to stick by as it will eventually get better.  But that goes on a whole other level when all that can be taken away instantly using an exploit that wormed it's way through flimsy security measures.  
---
*However*, it is not the toxic of parts of the community you or they should be focusing on. And it is ***parts*** of the community you are focusing on. The most vocal are obviously the most visible; you will not see countless posts praising the game consistently because content players aren't publicly vocal, they're playing the game or paying no mind. They might post like you do to make some sort of balance.  
---
But try not to dismiss critical members as toxic members, they're annoyed and impatient for a specific and justifiable reason: Many major issues have not been fixed since launch, and many seem well within the reach of Bethesda game studios to fix, but they still haven't and continue to not. Seemingly for no other reason than low effort, from making the game prior, to maintaining the game currently, to additions later.   
---
Even if it isn't poor effort, it is and will get increasingly frustrating as time goes on, up until people get fed up and give up on it, or come back to check in the future and probably be irritated with the state of it again. I repeat this, the people who *have* stuck around up until this point are either the most dedicated or the most critical. But even that criticism usually always extends from the same branch: Bethesda *NEEDS* to make the game better (because they realistically can), and people want the game to get better (otherwise they wouldn't complain).   
---
If you complain about something, it's typically a backhanded effort to get across it should be better. If you directly insult and threaten someone over it, that's something else entirely and should not be lumped together. Not saying either is at all good (one is awful), just underlining they stem from different motivations and that criticism *is* good when the product itself is received as bad by many. Even received as good, criticism should be welcome.  
---
Over time the game's mechanics, playerbase, it's and their creators public image *will* continue to get worse unless they put in their full effort and attempt to capitulate rather than let their playerbase feud with each other and take out their irritation indirectly. Weirdly I think that may be the intention, because it deflects feedback by not providing it, which so far has been to their detriment.  
---
This (and other previous incidents) has been nothing but a massive stain on Bethesda's credibility and reception, not because of the toxic players, they are just a result of it; but because they keep (seemingly) choosing not to remedy their mistakes they keep frequently making. From staying silent when major issues arise to pushing public hotfixes that tend to make gameplay or mechanics break, it all continues to compound on itself. After a certain point negativity is the only thing they should expect.  
---
The most I can give credit is their delay of Wastelanders to assure quality, which is also up in the air but something to look forward to.  
---
However *it is well within their ability* to lock down and push their efforts if they care to, instead of dividing their studio to making several games at once, which has already made expectations of their following games at an all-time low. Sadly, 76 has already been put on the boiler compared to Elder Scrolls and Starfield which are actively being made; so 76 will not get the attention it outright *requires* and people will keep believing that until Bethesda shows a different behavior and mindset other than ***monetization.***
---
*But they are here, because they have brought themselves here.* Regardless of player input now, this is a direct result of what they presented and stuck with. This is also a result of what we were presented with, and stuck with.
---
if this hacks taught us anything is that very few things are handled purely by the server.
---
as expected from Bethesda.
---
The friends I've made along the way - I'm lucky to have a a group of seriously great people that I can hang out with, even if it's little computer versions of them and I can reliably load up into Appalachia and get away from life's troubles by killing scorchbeasts with a rolling pin and talking to my buddies. 
---
I also really like the fallout series, the lore, the world, the game mechanics, the story, the mysteries.
---
Now you're putting words into my mouth. If I got hacked, the first thing i would want my inventory back. In fact I had my inventory hacked in GTAO and a reset didnt bring my weapons back so I had to buy them all again. I didnt go to Rockstar and demand everyone get a shark card because of their incompetence of dealing with hackers.
---
So it boggles my mind that players want free stuff, everyone to get free stuff, because other players are having their inventory lost. Like I said, I don't care about players getting private worlds until the problem is over, it's the fact players are taking this opportunity to put Bethesda on the spot for something awful people are doing. 
---
Bethesda owes the players affected by the hackers compensation. They don't owe everyone who's ever owned the game free stuff because of their "incompetence." Hackers are gonna hack the game and find exploits, that's not Bethesda's incompetence. Aimbots, wall hacks, and more make it past anti cheat software daily. 
---
Demanding fallout 1st for other players losing inventories is in fact trying to cash in on others misfortune. Should I, an Xbox player also get free fallout 1st for a month? I didn't deal with a hacker but there could be a chance the hack could be ported over. Why stop there? Let's give Ps4 players it, how about we give players who have never played the game fallout 1st free because of PC players getting hacked.
---
the minority of hackers make the game have a terrible rep
---
No, they aren't. Try this in an mmorpg. Hell, even in free games like PoE and Warframe. Server does validation, client has no authority, perfectly safe.
---
Your account is handled by the server. The characters cannot be deleted. Up until today, they could be robbed. Now they can't be.
---
Nope :) Just because you leave the keys to your car in the ignition doesn't mean the car thief shitty, just means they picked the low hanging fruit. And taking the keys out of the car door doesn't take long... And it won't stop them getting through the window in the future (and that may be harder to fix)... I think I've taken this analogy far enough but hopefully you get the point.
---
The non analogy version, the message system had the power to transfer items out of other player's inventories. This is what they fixed. nb. According to the hackers forum, it still has the power to place things I others inventories (not sure if this causes a problem but wtf?). The bigger issue which they need to address is that the client is authorative over the server for far too much. So for example hit detection is controlled by the client, player hp level again client, player position etc etc, all client. So in theory you could, with the right tools still be an immortal god in the game (see nw hackers) and this is much harder to fix. That's why hacking in nw is still a thing.
---
Tldr; Hackers just went for low hanging fruit and with that in mind it's not surprising that the fix was quick, but also don't be surprised when the next hack comes along.
---
I play because its still a fun game and (let be honest here) its improved a load sense launch
---
and that's about the only thing that can't be done to them. you seem really confident in Bethesda for someone who just typed "up until today," literally a year and some change, "they could be robbed".
---
not everyone will actually take their time to look into the game and will just look at youtubers posting negative things about the game
---
Of course Xbox players shouldnt get a month free, neither should ps4.
---
PC however, they could just change the code so everyone gets private servers with no extra bonuses until this is fixed. It's not that hard a concept to grasp.
---
Again, you are focusing on people wanting something for nothing, whereas I'd wager the majority of pc players want somewhere to just play the christmas event while other platforms are doing the same. 
---
Also, giving out atoms is usually what Bethesda do when they fuck up, why are you against them doing so now for compensation?
---
Underwear skins plz. 
---
oh wait...
---
if you can get past the bugs it still is fun
---
I love these post that speak as though they are the voice of the community. Demanding some contrivrtial action be taken to save the game. I'm willing to bet a large portion of the community would be even be more upset to having the game offline, regardless of of the current situation.
---
1000/10 reply
---
It's the most entertaining game of the decade. Even though I haven't played a single second of it I always get a good laugh when some new Todd's fuckup emerges and all the players after getting raped for the 50th time still go back to playing it. Keep it up!
---
Be pissed off that Bethesda refused refunds and only issued them when a court made them do so. Shows how much they care about the consumer.
---
I don't think it's nearly as buggy or broken as day 1, you can actually play it lol, but i mean... why would you want to?
---
Letting something like this game continue to fester will give other greedy companies get bad ideas. If FO76 continues to seem like it's profitable even in spite of the absolute total backlash, then companies like EA and other scummy publishers will truly lose all standards and games as a whole will be dragged down to these standards.
---
Literally, this game has the potential to actively hurt the gaming industry. If "ruining" the game for apologists like you is all that it would take to make sure that other games won't be dragged down by Bethesda's antics then hacks away. Personally I'm not going to inflate the player count any further and by _god_ will I not pay a dime for it, but my most sincere cheers to whoever is out there working to make sure that this trainwreck of a game will not be tolerated even by the most ~~abused of spouses~~ diehard fans.
---
OMG I love it. Sometimes I scour Appalachia looking for a half decent looking camp to admire and I rarely ever find that look half as nice as yours. Great job.
---
okay then....
---
Because it's actually interesting, unique and fun game with big TECHNICAL problems.
---
Gameplay is pretty good, just need some new content AFTER TECHNICAL PROBLEMS WILL FIXED
---
I mean it is possible on consoles depending on how the game stores stuff. Take Dark Souls 3 as an example, there are console cheats in that game, even online, because your character save data is stored locally. Grab it, change your character HP value to 9999999, inject it back, and you are now immortal on console.
---
This notion that consoles are free of hackers is very 90's mentality. Its only harder to implement.
---
But yea people blaming this on the engine aren't entirely right, its more about how the server allocates authority, it should never allow the client to have priority over itself.
---
I know the capabilities of the hackers and have an understanding of how the game works. I have 0 confidence in Bethesda, but I do have confidence that the hacker's have limitations to their capabilities.
---
the crashes and stuttering is annoying
---
What the point of your post?
---
Fo76 is essentially how I always end up playing Fo4: by ignoring the quests and npcs and just trying to survive and become stronger. the always-online nature of 76 is just an evil I'm forced to deal with in order to play.
---
wastelanders may actually drive me away.
---
yes they are interesting to say the least
---
Happens all the time with my Pump shotgun (PS4)
---
You can definitely see a lot of love went into the game. It's hands down the most well realised Fallout 3D map to date, with the lore and worlds curiosities all being super interesting.  
---
It's just that they weren't kidding when they said "We've never done anything like this before, we're all going to be learning together"
---
Ok this is a bit of a long shot, but I assume it's because the 'fog' is a type of graphics rendering element known as 'particles' and too many particle sources is a bad thing.  It's possible there'd be FPS issues with too many fog machines.   Yeah a long shot but the only reason I can think of!
---
eh. can't say I agree. if something is doable in Fo4, then it's probably doable in Fo76 as well.
---
and there are lots of ways to mess up with players still.
---
I'm blaming the community for _paying_ for this shoddy programming.
---
Pretty sure theres already damage reductions prefixes for other creature types , and assassins was made specifically for pvp given the fact there are no human npcs.
---
Star Wars Galaxies was my MMO Sweetheart. I never did get into another MMO.
---
it has a strong community to say the least im suprised many people still play
---
Can I just upvote you personally intrepid and have it auto-apply to all your posts xD
---
Yea it is! And from time to time it's also good to do something else. If I'd spend more time in a game/ thinking about it, than it's developers spend time at work, I do something wrong xD Currently I play a space game to get some diversity. Not Fallout's fault. Just a temporary change
---
it's possible. it's my understanding that the original script target raid armors only, you had to tweak it to target something else. I suppose different people tweaked it differently.
---
Some of my finest hours of gaming were in Star Wars Galaxies. One of my favorite online experiences ever, and I stopped playing MMOs after it wound down.
---
good on you
---
inb4 500 atoms “compensation”
---
Thanks for working on this.
---
This type of hack is not possible on consoles. Microsoft and Sony actually put teeth behind the lockdown of their consoles.
---
How'd you get into server programming, did you need a lot on you resima to get that job, sorry I'm just asking cos my school's bugging me 24/7 even on holidays to find my dream job.
---
They fix any bug that makes the game easier with a quickness but let shit like this fly....
---
As a Fallout 1st Member, and I will admit to feeling the need to jump into the game almost every day, even if it's a only for 15 min or so, to log-in, check the Atom store, and check my Santatron for Xmas gifts, which seem to be fairly regular, but primarily because I'm trying to ensure I am getting my moneys worth.  
---
I still do not think Fallout 1st is pay to win, it's an optional subscription, but could I continue playing FO76 without 1st? maybe, but as I am still very curious as to the future of Fallout 76 and what may be added over time, it is highly likely I will simply stick with the 1st Membership for the foreseeable future.
---
This was a problem in the first few months after the release. I was surprised how swim began to work in the game. Several sessions of 3-4 hours without disconnects, crashes and friezes. 
---
Maybe problem is still exists on consoles, i dunno cuz playing on PC (not top PC btw)
---
That jumped out at me too. I suspect restoring lost items probably isn't on the table, they'll simply try to come up with a way to buy players off...
---
Yeah, that post didn;t age well lol
---
I’m also a 1st member, since day 1. The post was about how with the hack going about earlier today that it was impossible to play without the paid F1st services.
---
Did you have an example where a player was able to use a client-side exploit to delete another player's character on Fallout 4? I'm not sure how that would be relevant here if not.
---
yeah im on xbox mostly scorchbeasts cause stuttering for me
---
If a scorched finishes off the robot it counts as me killing it
---
I play because I made alot of friends on it and I love just going on random adventures with all the different weapons and outfits I'm always finding new ways to enjoy myself in game
---
OP said deletion or something, implying more than just deletion. as far as I know, saves are handled by the server, so that's not something he has to worry about.
---
everything else, well. that's a different story.
---
same
---
Thanks! :) just trying to stop all of the misinformation and wild speculation. There's still plenty of harm these hackers can cause, but they're not wizards.
---
There'a a discord group where it was posted a very detailed script that allows you to move other characters and even delete them. Must be fake because i still don't see how that's possible but i guess only time will tell
---
jar jar was a palpatine clone. explains so much!
---
&gt;You seem upset, therefore I don't have to address the points that you're making.
---
“Meanwhile”? Just fucking delete the game and move on. This shit is not worth your time. At all. Value yourself. Save the space on your comp. let it fucking DIE!
---
I'd rather just blame Bethesda if we are pointing fingers. They should NEVER of allowed FO76 to launch without the basic securities in place. Now I love Bethesda and only want them to succeed, I really hope they get their act together and 2020 is a marvellous, joyous year for Fallout 76.
---
Dude, there's not even a million players left at this point.
---
Oh now it all makes sense... they were like "let's really fuck up the free version and drive everyone to private servers".... $$$
---
Tinfoil hat but I really wouldn't be surprised if the inventory steal hack is being allowed to happen... They could have disabled the servers immediately.
---
I don't disagree. I think the OP is trying to express that this wasn't caused by "the engine." The laughable lack of. Serious anti-cheat measures need to be put in place.
---
People will buy fallout 1st to keep playing...
---
Jar jar is Still my favorite character in the original trilogy
---
It's not supposed to be showing up yet.
---
You think CEOs of large companies sit with their feet up on December 23rd/24th... clueless.
---
Huh... you do know the ps4 is cracked right? New laws were made. Companies can no longer lawsuit people for fiddling with their devices. You bought it, you own it. The best they can do now is hope to catch you if you try to connect with an exploited OS and deny service (store, online multiplayer). But first they need to be aware of it.
---
You're also free to repair your device yourself or look for 3rd party services. Even those "void warranty if removed" stickers now mean nothing. (You have apple to thank for that one)
---
I have non-legit games on my PS4, also homebrew. Granted I can't go online with it since its an old known exploit, private ones don't suffer from this issue, generally.
---
Don't challenge them to sneak in a nude mod. 😆
---
Thanks !
---
i hate how they've said a ' a few '
---
There's a single video out there of some one stealing gear from nearly 500 people in  9 minute video
---
oh boy oh jeez well I don't care about children's movies anyways
---
I dunno man just having fun
---
Right. People have no idea how hard execs have to work... The thought of them sipping egg nog on december 23rd thinking "ah I'm so glad the lower downs can take the hit over Christmas!" is so ridiculous but seems to be a common view...
---
Update: I just saw the pics of what the rewards look like and I don't give rat's fuck, dude fuck Beth in the throat hole- those cunts give us utter gutter trash for "rewards". That winter coat looks so thin and stuck to the body like a fucking sticky windbreaker. And that beanie couldn't be more flaming. wwwtf
---
merry, or happy, Christmas my man!
---
it is 100% more fun to watch this game crash and burn with a new controversy every single month rather than playing it, and I have clocked in 200+ hours! merry, or happy, Christmas my man!
---
Oh god don't phone me if there's an issue it's December 22nd! I'm in the pool man, even if the entire company burns down, sorry it's family time! /s
---
Evidence
---
It was actually to add a pack of christmas emotes...
---
You and I might not be in the same country 😂 the right to repair is definitely still an ongoing issue in the US, and companies like Apple still vehemently assert their right to lock everything down.
---
Why are you in this forum then?
---
UHHHHHhhhhhh, yea it is the engine. Look on the forums the hackers use and there are instructions on how to hack FO76. The netcode being trash is ALSO an issue. You can tell the game to tell the server anything you want via the tools Bethesda put out to help modders. The engine is broken AF and there was a warning before the game launched about these kinds of problems that Bethesda ignored and then lied about. I'm just curious to see how badly Bathesda will screw the pooch on reimbursements and how the rabid fanboys will defend it.
---
Go eat shit, little wanker
---
Another you tuber suggested that guy was probably lying. Not because it isn’t possible to do but to think that someone really counted each person they robbed all the way to 500 seems like an extremely depressing life.
---
I might be mistaken, but that way you also use more of the camp budget tan if you'll use tire wall.
---
You're referring to the GM one. Funny thing, nobody has produced any proof of it; so.. no.
---
Well, one of those is right, so I guess you’re kinda evil.
---
24
---
I'd wager no one thought that stealing an entire inventory by looking at a player was possible, but here we are.
---
Patched for now, it's clear these people know what they're doing, I wouldnt be surprised if different hacks appear soon.
---
Im sorry, i should have wrote the commentsection didnt age well.
---
There is a lot of fun to be had playing the game.
---
I know people in real life who are really critical with basically everything and their stubbornness is the cause of their displeasure.
---
I'll be honest some of the decisions Bethesda took set them up in a way that they make EA look better, but it's fallout.  Oh and the battle royale is amazing, my roommate and I love playing it.
---
get downvoted for what telling people shit like this exists
---
The question was whether kills mattered. If we're being fair, the answer is that kills aren't the most important factor. Look at my score in the link below from a recent round. Did most of my 1302 XP come from kills? No. There's no need to down vote me. I'm answering the question about whether kills matter. The answer is no. Time survived is rewarded more than kills.

Fallout 76, the dumpster fire that keeps on giving.
---
What's your IGN, I have one I can give you :)
---
I have a blast in this game every day.
---
Apart from the missile silo state holo tape, the information panels in the General's wing of the Whitespring bunker display the state of each missile silo.
---
Not every game suits every gamer
---
Only boring people get bored.
---
I enjoy it, mainly just playing to farm presents atm, but still having fun.
---
because we love it, still and after everything what happened. because it gave us real life friends, game to play and its fun. Its pretty fcked up, but fun.
---
500+ is hardly a small number, regardless of how many actually play it. This is disappointing to have read about. You want to make it right? Then figure out a way to permanently ban the players who did this exploit to send a message. If you don't do this a fix is so pointless it's not funny.
---
Doing what? How? It’s the most boring game I somewhat consistently play. And FO4 is probably my 2nd favorite of all time.
---
Learn normal programming/game Dev first then go specialising in network/multiplayer programming.
---
Happy to help! Merry Christmas 🎅
---
Awesome response.  
---
Anyone found guilty of hacking and/or promoting exploits to ruin the enjoyment of other players need to be perma-banned.
---
I'm pretty new in the game....so....what is going on?
---
Oh, it's a limited analogy. I was looking up Kohler parts and muttering to myself, "Throw away a banana? 'Swrong with you, ya make frekin' bread." XD
---
It's a taboo to make fun of disabled individuals, unless they're fallout 76 fans.
---
Sure, they could permanently ban an account that performed the exploit but what's to stop that scum bag  just opening another account?
---
Oh damn, I didn't even know that was a thing is this across all platforms?
---
Just use your imagination.
---
Can we not blame the cunts who are hacking? Sure they did it because the code wasn’t the best but if a bank get robbed because the manger left the safe open the robbers are still the bad guy
---
I mean. This is absolutely beautiful. It literally looks like it was taken from a diff game. Congrats on this fantastic work
---
Merry Xmas from down under in the future where Santa always visits first
---
This is why they need to do it and go after them legally, this was done by PC players, so if they have account information it would not be difficult to be proactive and show the community they truly do care. I'm pretty sure using this exploit would be a Terms of Service violation. They've been having issues since launch. If they want to send a message to the players that we are not just a $ symbol to them this would be the way to do it.
---
I installed my game on a solid state drive, which has almost completely eliminated stuttering.
---
Cheers
---
I *am* over there.
---
hahahahaahhahahahahaha absolute state of bethesda drones
---
Sensible? How is it not sensible to wish you could fucking play the game you paid for without the risk of losing your shit? The option is there, but behind a paywall. Bethesda is trash. People need to speak out about it.
---
Because despite the issues this game has, it's still a pretty fun game.
---
I payed about 10€ and got 100+ hours of gametime so far, not even finished the main questline.
---
So I totally feel I got my moneys worth.
---
Playing on PS4, it seems we get less issues than PC in general.
---
This has nothing to do with modding. It has to do with using an old engine for single player games. It makes hacking so easy it's a joke.
---
LOL no joke 
---
" I love this franchise and will continue to love it but with people like you populating FO76, I'm happy to stick with FO4 and the others. (To be fair you're probably really nice ingame, most players are, as was I, and that is the only redeeming quality) Goodbye. Enjoy the bugs, hacks, and blunders and thanks for reinforcing my decision of leaving this misguided community (some of them at least, most are still alright). " 
---
the fact that you are countering yourself makes me like you and want you to stay. that indicates  level of self reflection not found so often now days. so I will try to engage without being a dick. 
---
1. the easier the game the less mature the fanbase. I dont mind the bugs hacks and blunders as much. I have been pc gaming since the 90s. this recent hack is nothing NOTHING compared to Ultima Online in the original version. players were allowed through legal in game mechanics to steal from your inventory. if they got caught the guards would whack them. of course the dickish elements of the community blew that shit right up, they would attack in a mob and legally rape you. fully within game rules. if they died they would just loot each other. this went on for months.  every bank visit was like getting attacked by a mob of horny seagulls. so I adapted. this hack attack caused me to adapt again if a player cannot adapt I am ok if they leave. 
---
2. all the originals were subscription based. the original gamers had to sink serious money into a PC the group was more respectfull mature and likable, we treated each other like people. just like in 76 though theres always that 10% douche bag group even way back then. dumb people are mean. dumb people per capita make less money than smart people. so a pay wall is something I actually like and is actually better for the game. if little billy gets pissed because he runs out of storage and doesn't have the patience or intelligence to sort his junk and play with in the game parameters I WANT little billy to quit and leave. the one most disturbing trend I have seen over the past 4 decades of gaming is that the more mainstream and popular it becomes the more stupid and disrespectfull the player base becomes. 
---
3. " I have "existed" since beta long before I got fallout first. its a good game I like it with or without the sub. with the sub is more convenient though so I will be staying subbed. anyway further conversation is pointless you are quitting so good bye dont let the door hit you on the ass. o/" &lt;---that statement is 90 percent a direct rebuttal against the main title heading of your post and only 10 percent of me being a dick. and I was kinda cheerfully fn with you. in truth. its better for me if you stay. this fanbase is small I do not wish for it to be smaller and I apologize for any offense I have caused. ( and since I am sure I will offend you again probably pretty fast I apologize for that in advance. I am blunt, I am a smartass, and my humor doesnt translate worth a shit in written format.) 
---
in summary the pay wall is good it keeps out the dumb poor people. (&lt;--- is why I apologized in advance) 
---
the bugs and technical issue's are ok, no matter the game they will exist, even if the game gets right for a change windows will just update and fuck that up. if its not windows malfunction its ISP, if not ISP its your video card updating, if not that its your spyware being activated in the background. 
---
so look I encourage you to stick it out. at the least you can hang out here from time to time and argue with me. doesn't matter what game you go to there will be the same issues and sorry my friend but Appalachia just doesnt exist anywhere else in the digital world. it is the most unique game on the market right now. fuck if you trully have a need to fight for a reason join me in my boycott of legendary weapons. Adopt the BOS faction and commit to playing in nothing but vanilla gear. you can blame beth but the root cause of all the drama 76 faces lies with legendarie weapons and their affect on things. dupers destabilize servers duping them and selling them on ebay, people buy them on ebay and broke pvp with pay to win gear, legacy weapons lag out the queen fight and man those things have been duped 5 billion times. those people are the ones you should be mad at not beth. beth fucked up and made it easily hackable but they are the people actually breaking it.
---
Yeah I’ll just quit this game forever. Because it shouldn’t take too much imagination to make it fun.
---
HWID bans are almost as ineffective as IP bans. Investing time into such a system is a waste of time and resources. It takes ~ 3 Minutes to avoid any HWID ban.
---
Consoles were never affected
---
Fallout 76 players are masochists that get off on the feeling of despair which Bethesda has provided since Day 1.
---
I'm still hoping for a Vault Boy getting angry emote, whether it be the iconic "F you" pose or that Qbert thing with "$!@#*" covering his mouth. But for more strategic ones, an emote for "I need more *insert ammo caliber*" or "Enemies ahead, let's attack"/"Enemies ahead, let's avoid them" would be very nice.
---
LOL you should you should. I am PCMaster race and consider consoles potatoes. but sir. potatoes are a fine sturdy source of nutrition worthy of respect. and after this hack I admit to really want a potatoe at this point lol :) good on you sir.
---
this doesnt work mby only on consoles
---
whAt iS WroNg WIth yOu pEoPLe?
---
You can move other players (sort of). You can't delete them.
---
actually lvl 30 is where it begins to start with starched genes perk et al.
---
try specialized builds, try out how OP you can get, have fun with friends and collect all stuff and lorenotes.
---
basicly what made fo4 fun as well.
---
Personally, I can only speak for xbox myself.
---
If you look up the credits, a lot of their server engineers are people who worked on pretty big multiplayer or MMO games.
---
I don’t think it’s lack of talent, but I’m guessing lack of management/rushed development of the online aspect. Turning the horrible engine into one that allows MP probably took more time than expected, so they didn’t allow the employees enough time or resources to actually make it a secure and stable service
---
Holy crap this is a great idea. Of all the crap going around this week this is probably their best fix until they can actually do their job
---
They are not genuine hackers. They can mess with some code, but breaking into secured servers is so far beyond their skillset. It's like expecting trash pandas to break into Fort Knox.
---
*turns on his PS4*
---
Nope
---
I have a 200GB/mo data cap. I can't be spending 50GB+ on patches sadly
---
I hope they don’t it would remove one of the few tactical layers of the mode. It’s only a few seconds anyway it’s not that bad.
---
Down an enemy make him call for his comrades then kill those who turn up. Really satisfying when it works. 👍
---
I don’t even know what it looks like
---
Making fun of disabled people is wrong, unless they're FO76 fans.
---
I don't know if it's even possible. Have you tried to reload the game? Yesterday, when people loosing their Pip-Boys they were "restored" upon next logging.
---
Well companies in US are very keen on not giving you any right to whatever they sell you so yea, makes sense.
---
I bet they do, you just cant tell. lol
---
Ad Victoriam Brother
---
Didn't they give back people's stuff before? Geeze people, let's see how it goes from here yes? It's possible.
---
Ty for saying this. There aren't magical hw bans out there that bes can use. Once again we have arm chair quarterbacks who think the movie hackers was based on fact. 
---
Hardware bans for PC are almost impossible, it's not like hw has a social security number people, it's like saying I'm going to ban every am radio in the Tampa area that was on station abc last night.
---
He should put a Mudsdale for proper kicking reference.
---
Don't let the hackers soon guys, c'mon.
---
Then you want Fallout 2.
---
That's simply because underwear is part of the body mesh and not an independent item.
---
It's also a catch 22 because Bethesda has no real chance or intention of ever fixing their games (much like Fallout 4, 3, Skyrim, Olbivion, etc. which are still bug ridden messes that largely rely on modders). They have always relied on the community to make their games great, so if they take mods out they close the one route they've ever had to having a working game. And then you end up with fallout 76, a broken pile of pieces that oozes cluelessness. The reality is "Fallout First" should be Fallout Standard and the game should've always been intended to be played like that so the awful components of all Bethesda games could be solved to focus on the positive elements of the game.
---
I'm working on another right now :)
---
They have. Every single new vehicle for every patch? Tends to be in the millions.
---
Provide proof, otherwise bullshit
---
Sounds like you two should seek some couple’s counseling ;P
---
I stand corrected. Same day fix.
---
No, we can't. They are a bunch of cunts, sure. To make an analogy, I'll blame the city and the police if their actions lead to empowering thieves to steal my shit. If they take my tax they should deliver on their end of the bargain. The ones breaking the law are wrong but the ones allowing things to happen when they have the funds to invest in fixing it are the real cunts.
---
Thanks for the input. Tracking down mysteries isn’t for me, though the Fallout lore may be the most interesting of any game I have ever played. I just don’t care to walk around forever without action looking for it.
---
I actually love combat the most, and miss FO4 for that. I’m always underpowered in 76. Care to help?
---
I am very much looking forward to Wastelanders! I really hope it makes it an entirely new game, but don’t have much hope.
---
Very helpful thanks.
---
I used to play PC gaming for like 10 years until it got to much to upgrade. I do miss having a awesome rig to game on. I don't hate on PC players. Sony was down for a long time a couple years ago. I think I received infamous because of it, oh and Wipeout. So it can happen...
---
Remember the gforce 256 graphics card tho! That's power. I miss the bf1942 days.

As a consumer can we please blame Bethesda for being a shit fucking company and stop giving them out money for this kind of shit? Every week it's something new with this game. STOP FUCKiNG PLAYING IT, YOU CUNTS!!!!!!
---
SOS when
---
perk cards are 99% of the equation. 
---
some other factors are perception, reaction, control inputs. 
---
how are your eyes? I cant help you with glasses
---
when you say slow would you say your reactions are ok in the real world. if I pitched a tennis ball at you would you catch it easily? if so then most likely its an input issue with your control configuration. 
---
I dont know if you are right or left hand dominant or rather you prefer to drive with mouse or keyboard or both but I can tell you some possible ideas. 
---
1. I placed raised super glue dots on my keyboard.  I can find 6 of my most used buttons by feel and instinct with my left hand without ever looking down. if you find yourself using your eyes to find a button frequently perhaps make it easily found by feel. 
---
2. remap keys so that your left hand doesnt have to "travel" my "combat keys" are always up left and close to my natural resting point of my left hand. the less I use an item the further it moves away from that upper left side. 
---
3. last but not least. dont rely on windows and mouse for everything like my wife. learn your hotkeys. remap them if needed. nothing sucks more than trying to use a stim pack and accidently opening your inventory. anti biotics is my number 8. I rarely use it in combat so its far off the beaten path I dont have to worry about accidentally eating it or opening inventory mid fight trying to get them "emergency heals" if you have to open a wheel or inventory tab to heal mid combat you should really consider taking the time to find a home for your items on your wheel and committing the important stuff to muscle memory. 
---
4. how responsive is your mouse? it should be responsive to the point where you have to be careful when you first get on the PC almost too fast at first, after you use it a few minute you should be able to start reflexively making it go where you wish . 
---
5. last but not least can you instinctively go forward back right strafe left strafe with your control configuration. my wife doesnt strafe at all. she moves forward and turns to every thing directly. it drives me nuts she is missing out on a big part of the positioning and targeting pie.
---
Pretty sure there's a transaction log telling how an item came to be.
---
I'm also not sure the guys getting banned back then weren't just dupers trying to get their accounts back.
---
I literally picked up 1300 pounds of duped TSE shotguns and spent the better half of an hour wadling to the acid pits to unload them a place their lvl 1 butts couldn't get to.
---
No bans here.
---
Ad Victorium o7

Microsoft tried even before that.

Search 'Microsoft Palladium'.

You are the most incompetent game development company since Daikatana.
---
Not counting Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing - since only AAA games.
---
I think when I scrapped something with the camp unit on top it was just floating there in the air.
---
Once I had it in the greenhouse, when it was destroyed the unit was gone, but it reappeared after repairing the greenhouse.
---
Did you look up in stored tab? Or tried to relog? If this doesn't work set up a new camp.
---
I'm glad I got out when I did. The hacks are out in the public. Literally anyone can start wiping people. Fallout 1st disgusted me when I saw it, and the Atom Shop has become worse and worse after I left. The entire game is pay-to-skip. It's a restricted grind for the sake of selling you shortcuts. It's a greedy dumpster fire.
---
I've tried a similar trick,but found that if solo the Ultracite will only spawn about 5 mobs. Does your method increase these spawns?
---
Wow  i wish i could farm there, but im only level 20 :(

Did bethesda put a fucking warning anywhere? Or is it our responsability to go to reddit or youtube every time we want to play? And even if they had issued a warning like they fucking should, they would still be the ones to blame. Their shitty and idiotic decisions and business practices are fucking with the enjoyment of their costumers. And ignorant people like you are not helping. stop blaming the victims. If you care about this game stop covering up for this trash of a company that the 2019 bethesda is.
---
500 atoms inbound
---
How about keep away forever and find a better game?
---
Second this. Those costumes look just plain idiotic (disclaimer: in my opinion of course), they break the immersion totally. And also, on public servers, if your playstyle is sneaky and you clear locations slowly then expect somebody in PA with their All Rise or BE Gatling Plasma appear and ruin your fun. Ptivate servers really improved the quality of life in this game for me.
---
doesnt every nic card have a mac address? couldn't that mac address be blocked? just spit balling. Mac address gets Identified by DHCP and given an IP address does that info not get carried forward from that point?
---
If you made proper backups you dont need to compensate at all... Get the player id. go back to your back up files. copy paste the rollback data from that player into the live version. done :x you are going to piss up many many people if you give em just trash like last time and say sry hahahaha
---
How about this: Stop playing the game until Bethesda shows even an iota of care. Seriously, they ignored people complaining about Fallout 1st despite how disgusting of a practice it was. They ignored people when they complained about the repair cost nerfs (since it got nerfed for being "overused"). They ignored people when they got accused of breaking their promise of having the Atom Shop as cosmetic-only. They're not going to start listening now.
---
A few???? fucking lol.
---
I checked everywhere, seapped servers, logged out and back in, my camp unit is gone into the void prolly hanging out with all my scrap that got deleted during the scrap box fiasco, I must be masochist, so many game play hours ruined by bugs, I have to redeploy and rebuild my entire camp.
---
They might not be able to, but every time we think it can't get worse, it does. Next thing might be something like changing your avatar into preston garvey
---
Yeah im not 100% sure but a buddy of mine knows a lot of hackers
---
It's pay to get robbed by bethesda and protect yourself from being robbed by hackers. The only difference is what people are stealing from you.   
---
And hey, i'm all for you paying for it if you enjoy the features. But the fact they are charging this when they claimed to only sell cosmetics is just outrageous. Putting the hability to play alone behind a pay wall is just disgusting.   
---
I lost a lot of my interest in this game and now that I got Red dead redemption 2 downloading i'll probably abandon fallout, a game I was just coming back to after that disaster of a release.
---
Yeah it's a separate hack
---
Bethesda next patch: "we now added skins for underware so that you can get robbed in style"
---
Thought this was what people were talking about? Don't many game companies do this already? I have no idea what OP is talking about nor do I think it's necessary
---
25 years in the IT industry, and you can't even fix you're own damn enter button?
---
...damn shame
---
some people do and you know what they say "the last one to die is hope".
---
Because people in your friend list can still join your servers uninvited. Some people have big friend lists with a lot of people they met while playing. If one of those decides to suddenly download the hacking tools (since it's available publicly) then you can still get everything wiped.
---
Don’t know then the games buggy so it’s probably a bug, if your on pc just use discord and on Xbox use the live chat thingy option
---
He already did, you bought the game didn't you? Seriously, stop lowering your standards. Even if the game was in an acceptable state, it's not worth buying a 100 bucks a year subscription for a game you already paid full freaking price for.
---
The abusive relationship metaphor is still the best one to describe this absolute total lack of logic the Bethesda disciples comes up with. At this point I usually can't tell if they *are* working for Beth or not.
---
I think you just didn't pay enough.
---
Todd is fine.  the Hacker is at fault for this not bethesda. personally I hope they make the pay wall higher to keep more dumb poor people out. 10 feet higher should do it.
---
🤡
---
Small chance I think, but you could check the position where it was, if there appears the CAMP/repair all option. Maybe it's just invisible? otherwise I think redeploying everything would be your only option :/
---
“HoW aBoUt KeEp AwAy FoReVeR aNd FiNd A bEtTeR gAmE¿” maybe because some people actually play games that they enjoy and make em happy? Stop being so crusty lmao
---
Take off the tinfoil hat mate, you're right. They fixed stuff like "repair cost perks over-performing" before they even released the repair kits. This controversy is just more proof that dedicated Fallout 76 fans will not quit the game no matter how terrible the game is.
---
Tell that to the people who bought it thinking its going to be good like past fallout and got a steaming pile of shit instead with a declined refund
---
this is hilarious
---
get fucked lmao
---
You are right in what you are saying but the connection to the Bethesda servers are technically bound to your internet connection. So the MAC will be your routers mac along with the ip address..
---
Except we aren't wrong. The game is nothing more than a boring grindfest that you can bypass if you pay a bit more. It's still buggy and every patch somehow fixes a few bugs yet introduces more. Every feature they bring out is broken on release. Even the premium subscription service (still disgusted by that) came out deleting people's junk.
---
Virtual nic teaming would make that a mute along with a million other factors. You are correct that each nic has a unique Mac but no o one worth their salt today would be using physical gear for this sort of exploit development. Even if they did, nic cost about 5 bucks used on eBay. You could scoop up a few copy cats maybe when it's public, which rest assured an easily excitable version will soon be if for nothing else to muddy the waters of the initial source. Every kid who can run an installer will soon be using this exploit and posting videos showing their "L337" skills to friends if bes doesn't get it patched soon. 
---
I think there will be nothing but waves of painful exploits now that someone with real code skills is in the mix. Hopefully I'm wrong but this doesn't look good imo.
---
People don't realize that Russia is right up there with north Korea in regards to hacking for profit. Sometimes profit is actual cash, sometimes profit is damage to a rival company, sometimes profit is just pissing someone off.
---
You are complaining about community toxicity by being toxic yourself. Ironic.
---
So "people who come into this sub just to hate" are not haters? Get a grip mate.
---
Dude... fanboys... does anyone have to say more?
---
I mean even their statement that they dont give players compensation but only those that "believe they have been negatively affected" already implies they will grill you for details YOU have to take time to collect to get an apology 20 ATOMs or something...
---
There are a shitload of people that stopped playing on PC once this shit got known because they didnt want to lose their stuff, what do they get? Nothing, because they cant provide any proof of that claim...
---
They should just apologize with some ingame content or a month of 1st or whatever, but this reeks of "see we are doing something!" while not even doing the minimum...
---
Go to a new location and put your camp down again... then relocate back to where you were and put the camp down again then your “stored” camp...
---
The whole post implies that its fake and/or super rare or smaller than we KNOW it is. We saw streamed and vod proof of this shit happening on live, we know its not some made up internet karma machine... they still try to imply it is a tiny thing.
---
Damage control my ass, does anyone truly believe their bullshit anymore?
---
Happened to me once when PS4 needed a system update.
---
Redeploying was my only option, I took the time to repeat the situation too, if your camp unit is on or near a rug and you store or scrap it buh bye camp unit. Did it 3 fucking times in a row without issue, so be weary folks you can totally scrap your fucking camp unit. What pisses me off is I live in the Bay Area, ex home to sony, sega, 3do, I've professionally tested games as a young adult, how the fuck are they not catching these petty lil bugs that are game fucking breaking. I tested some pretty big titles and was fucking stoned doing it and we still caught all the fucking bugs.
---
Okay, and what do you base that last statement on?  I haven’t played FO4 in over a year (since the last DLC came out and I completed it).
---
Its ridiculous that you have to file a specific claim if you "BELIEVE" that you have been affected...  the minimum should be a rollback for people to request if they got shit on by the cheaters and everyone else should get an apology 1st month just because...
---
It was done for the least amount of money, just like everything else in Fallout 76.
---
If I was performing at my job, the way Bethesda is performing on fo76, I wouldn't have a job to go to.
---
You weren't though. They knew about it and they let it go live. That alone should be proof of their malice. They likely didn't intend to fix it this fast but the backlash came sooner than they expected because of that one player who wiped over 500 players' inventories and posted it on Youtube.
---
1 person stealing 500 peoples stuff is one single incident, of an easy to use and readily available hack... do you really think it was just 500?
---
Are you that naive?
---
Some people just cant let a meme die as it seems. Poor virgin boy :( soon you will get what you deserve.
---
You are insane. You people are insane. Instead of going after BETHESDA whom allows this to happen by making such a broken game, you want to go after this guy.
---
Do you have any statistics on the playerbase?
---
There are no official active player numbers, so how will you know that 10.000 is 1%?
---
I would be surprised if all systems combined even had 10k players still...
---
There isnt, those are some slapped together data collectives of user account data that people upload.
---
Its at best some estimate that is completely unverifiable and unbelievable.
---
We just dont have any numbers but i would be surprised if 76 had 10k active players over all systems.
---
The reality of PC hardware bans is the hyper visor made it impossible.  You can literally spoof any part of a machine through the virtual system.
---
Sorry dude, but you need to read up on networking.
---
In your statement is just enough truth to make refuting this an allnighter.
---
Mac don't get "identified", they are just a hexadecimal number assigned to the nic, and they are easily changeable.
---
I try not to. The last time that happened, a high level player came. Took everything and disappear. Drop only when player response to you. Now waiting for bethesda to fix the issue. I have inventory full of level 1, 5, 10 guns, melee n armours for newbies
---
First time i have been grateful for being locked down by them xD
---
They are only talking about compensation about the "few" people that "believe" they are affected. They will get 20 ATOMs and Bethesda will feel generous, while everyone else doesnt get anything.
---
How could one of the most beloved companies fall so deep... Bethesda today is unrecognizable from the company that gave us Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and even Fallout 4....
---
See, this is the real sad thing when it comes to this game. Cause it seems like it is the higher up portion of the company that's the problem, and I mean the really high up portion, not just team management but the the money interested corporate shadow of the company. I can see some genuine passion did go into a good portion of the game. The world is well crafted, there is so many fine details that tell so much story, there is so many little things that showed some of the devs were actually having fun crafting the experience. But it's the top of the studio thats pushing a focus on the wrong things; the clearly forced in multiplayer, the spead up release, the focus on microtrans and subscriptions before the functionality. I love great amount of this game, I just wish the devs had the chance to focus on crafting the experience they wanted to deliver first and the multiplayer and other corporate crap second.
---
I'm almost considering staying off until wastelanders because I'm so scared all my progress is going to be deleted by a malicious douche or a child thinking its funny
---
&gt;nah mate give them **5**~~00~~ atoms and an "i'm sorry" email"
---
FTFY.
---
Sounds too much, 50 is probably more likely \^\^
---
You're a paltry creature
---
Burn Bethesda burn... 
---
So glad i never bought this or elder scrolls online.
---
I'm glad I got out when I did (the moment the Atom shop items started giving stat boosts), every time something like this pops up I'm glad I can say I dodged the bullet. This one would have broken me for sure.
---
Why are you looking for more Tesla pvp? It's boring. Roll a new character and craft a normal fixer and see how many kills you can get. I promise you, a lot of people underestimate how powerful a low level character is when played by an experienced pvper.
---
You want a real challenge? Get wanted on a level 30 character and try to kill all the high levels that try to collect your bounty. Nothing is more satisfying than smoking a level 200 character on my lv32 character with a non legendary fixer lmao
---
    modpos z 1000
---
I'd love to see a middle finger emote
---
What are you up to this time of the year man? Hopefully not reviving up a painfully mediocre game!:(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
People in here honestly believe 76 has "hundreds of thousands" playing... are they dense or something? I would be flabbergasted to hear that 76 had even 10k combined over all systems, but HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS.... how can anyone be this ridiculously stupid and oblivious...
---
Oh no, how will PC users ever recover? Who would've imagined that the worst released AAA game of the decade which effectively doesn't have an anti-cheat system, something that even basic korean grindfest MMOs have?
---
Why did they do anything in this game the way they did it? It's money. You can play "single player" if you buy the subscription service and go to a private server. The reason they don't solve issues for free is because you won't pay for it then. That's why they sell time-savers and convenience items in the Atom shop. That's why they sell the subscription service with private servers and scrap boxes.
---
Differences:
---
\- WOW had  model of Pay before + Monthly subscription. People are less likely to cheat "aggressively" with removing things from other peoples.
---
\- For teleport hacks, depend on the cost of teleport, how much they teleport, etc. and they probably do exist
---
\- WOW has "Add Items" hacks, so it isn't unreasonable to say it would be possible to remove items. Just, people weren't interested in doing that in WOW. 
---
\- You're overeacting since this is Bethesda. Blizzard has people literally streaming with aimbots plus reported invulnerability hacks in a game where aim is literally the most important thing, but no one is fucking batting an eye.
---
I wouldn’t say that 532+ people is a small amount, but sure let’s go with that...
---
Yesterday i hopped in pyblic server for a few hours. Only see a few players in there. Was lucky nothing happened to me.
---
I also pay60 dollars for the game and another 110 dollars a year to play a massive multiplayer game offline and by myself. /s
---
Because Bethesda released a $60+ beta without telling people that's what the game was. And in it's first year, barely anything has been fixed.
---
Also I have a question. You say Bethesda should fix the bugs and glitches, but that they shouldn't always be blamed. Well, who should be blamed? Isn't it their fault the bugs and glirches exist in the first place?
---
Please, they didn't make New Vegas. Obsidian did.
---
Ralof: Hey you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the dam right? Walked right into that Raider ambush same as us and that thief over there.
---
Why you have to molest people here? You feel so lonely that even negative contact to people cheers you up? Please stop existing troll
---
Its fun with friends lads, heard it here first
---
i think they did. 4 kills second place  - 400 xp.. i mean.. what the heck..
---
Duuuuudddee molest is something worse than you think, you should try "harass"
---
Is it fun with friends?
---
There is a video of 1 hacker attacking over 500 people and this wasnt the only person using this hack so not sure how you can say only a few people were effected with a straight face...
---
I say: HANG THEM, HANG THE BASTARDS WHO STEAL OUR STUFF.
---
&gt; Because I like the previous games and have a shred of hope they will fix this shit show they call a game.
---
How? After all this time, after every controversy, HOW?! How do you delude yourself into thinking they will fix it? It would take better developers 5 years to make a decent game out of this shitshow. But they're not after making a decent game. They're after your money. It's why the initially "cosmetic-only" Atom Shop started selling gameplay-boosting items, weapons, fridges, and time-savers. It's why they added an overpriced subscription service to a full-price game to paywall the most-requested features. There is no goddamn hope for this game. Not while Bethesda is making it.
---
Not the point. There are SEVERAL options for an offline Fallout. The argument that there should an offline mode for an online only game is ridiculous.
---
&lt;tinfoill&gt; 
---
Maybe they are trying to run the game into the ground so they can say "well guys, sorry we tried, but with only 3 people actively playing, it doesn't make any financial sense to keep 'er running" and shut it all down.
---
&lt;/tinfoil&gt;
---
No problem 👍🏻
---
The game can be quite difficult at that point.
---
I'd say make sure you are using your perks correctly. Focus on one weapon type. Take a few nights and spend them joining events to get some nice XP boost and hopefully some decent gear.
---
Are you following any build?
---
ya thats what did, it would of been really nice if like i didnt have to fucking do thay a rebuild my shit all over again, im starting to come to terms that all of us who play bethesda games have some type of mashocistic personalities to enjoy these games, its been this way since fucking morrowind, "hey bro thats a common bug, everyone knows your supposed to jump 3 times and then unequip and than requip your weapon and than you walk through the door backwards, if not you wont be able to finish the quest", 15 years of this bullshit, I must be masochist.
---
You go for it 👍🏻
---
I felt the same way. I never actually used a private server until yesterday. 
---
It was weird items not being looted in common areas, not finding random stuff in containers, and not hearing someone tromp up in power armor.
---
Imagine still playing fallout 76 lol that should be criminal.
---
The pretentious "it's not that bad" kind. [Just look at this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk) to see how much of a lie it really is.
---
There is no such thing as karma. But there is a thing called account ban.
---
*I’m level 30 or so and have only been playing during the double XP weekends for about 6 months,* doesn't sound like you enjoy the world much. what I am picking up is that you just aren't feeling it. 
---
*hoping something will have changed (30 hours played I’d estimate). But nothing ever changes.* war war never changes also realize at 30 hours you have probably seen 2 % of the entirety of the in game content. i have been playing since hour one of beta and my main is level 382. I STILL see shit I never saw before. you know nothing jon snow. how can you say nothing changes in the game if you haven't even scratched the surface. 
---
*The basic early missions are still bugged as hell and there is nothing actually fun to do.* just leveled an alt the early missions are working fine you are screwing something up. if smashing robots shooting scorched and rummaging through building after building isnt fun for you you definately have the wrong game.
---
*I didn’t buy this game to build a CAMP over and over,* uh oh you may have bought the wrong game [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  that airship is one of my favorite camp builds so far if you cant like or enjoy that just gtfo and go back to madden allstars you are way to mainstream. 
---
 *or go on scavenging missions to collect whatever.*  yup sounds like it. its a survival game literally built around enviromental story telling and scavenging in order to avoid death. the whole dan game is one giant scavenging mission. 
---
*Everything about this game is boring.* I am definately getting the "bought the wrong game" vibe seriously everything? at 30 whole hours you have seen the entirety of all of applachia and deemed that everything is boring. not one laugh not one giggle not one moment of sadness for a sad tale you stumble on in the wild? not one fight that gave a close call not one player interaction that was nice or tense not one incident of shit going horribly sideways and you barely escaping with your life? bullshit. 
---
*Does anyone actually think it can be saved? (this post comes after spending 6 hours in a day desperately attempting to have fun, but having none)*there's nothing wrong with the game its you. you just don't like the game personally I dont like golf. tried it. didnt like it. moved on. now thats a typical human response. what I wouldn't do is go try and get my friends to talk me into golf. that's dumb I already tried it I know I don't like it why would I waste their or my time any further. fuck golf. 
---
*Edit: I really want to like this game, and very much welcome posts that explain how to have fun playing it* 
---
have you tried actually listening to holotapes and reading the notes. start at the vault with a brand new guy and just read  and listen to crap. fuck the double XP weekend bullshit fuck worrying about levels just find the damn story. the shit is interesting. it is there. read it damnit. I highly suspect you have 0 hours and are just here talking shit. what ever I did my due diligence and tried to help. I doubt this is the right game for you though.
---
No, but I do enjoy it. Not to mention that it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, however, I do expect to be able to play it.
---
Finally someone who sees it. I think many problems come from the publishers rather than the developers. I often saw many games being worse than other games by the same developer due to a very tight release schedule and less resources.
---
I see where people are coming from, but people often blame Todd Howard for everything that's going to hell in Fallout 76. The man made many false statements, but he isn't responsible for everything bad that happens.
---
It's a one-click hack and he has been roaming around. Do you think it was just those 8 minutes? Or just him doing it? The hack was out in the open.
---
So they could rollback but only when they really need to.
---
THERE WAIT what about fallout 4 is your favorite.
---
Considering how the game has shrank since release? Not small. Wouldn't surprise me if it was 5% of the players playing at the time. And now considering that was just 1 hacker, and this hack was publicly available, it becomes a bigger number. Seeing how it's seemingly a one-click wipe, I don't think you can really argue the devastation this is causing.
---
However many years speaking English, and you still haven't learned the difference between "your" and "you're"?
---
...damn shame.
---
Why not start investing in the alternatives. I ditched this dumpster fire after the repair cost perk got nerfed early on and never regretted it.
---
Hopefully, thanks for the discord suggestion!
---
fallout 4 was one of my favorite too what did you like about fallout 4 the most.
---
Should is the critical word.
---
Originally yes, they claimed they did not have the tools to restore lost items from glitches for much of the game’s release. However some time after the Vault 94 update where players were losing all their items due to a loading glitch, Bethesda acknowledged that the glitch was real (there was a lot of pushback on this sub saying it wasn’t) and “rollbacked” at least one player’s character to 2-3 weeks before the drop happened. 
---
I imagine they may have to do something similar again for the PC players, but the player who is confirmed to have been rolled back was only given this treatment after several tickets and many forum/reddit posts (where he was often belittled by members of the community who thought he was lying) so Bethesda may not be as willing to rollback everyone, but hopefully they’ve changed since then.
---
Bethesda was informed a week in advance by the hacker who made the hacking tool. Besides, I doubt a hacker brazen enough to post his deeds on youtube would really lie to inflate his numbers.
---
Heeeeey its the old slow guy o/ me I love me some fallout 4 but 76 replaced it. I do miss the settlement building from 4 though aint gonna lie.
---
You are a troll. You do not get paid for that.
---
You are are an amateur troll, got that?
---
You said I'm advocating 76, when I only called you a troll and asked about your bridge.
---
Your the one insulting, insinuating, and pulling shit out of your ass.
---
So, again, coom oot unt die troll.
---
Thanks I will have to check it out.
---
Hotfix patch notes:
---
- Implemented a fix so that your character roster is a lootable container.
---
- Asked Santa to stop all these hackers.
---
While doing the sheepsquatch quest, stop once you get the to the part where you get the assualtron circuit board though. Even if you are level 100 and not prepared for that mission you will get your ass handed to you lol
---
Ever heard of how abusive relationships? Just search that up and you'll understand everything.
---
I would rather be naked than wearing the dirty ass underwear they give us. I wish they did steal my underwear.
---
That's not the playerbase. That's, at most, the total accounts that owned it. You need to realize anyone with a shred of sense in them has jumped ship a long time ago. The recurring playerbase is likely closer to 10,000 if it is even that much.
---
That's because the game was designed to be empty without other players.
---
We could do with a bit more variety in the throwing weapons area I agree.
---
Really ? It took you THIS long ?   
---
I mean...  C'est la vie.. but.. there were obvious warning signs MONTHS ago.   
---
I was lucky enough to get out of this mess rather quickly but following it, even just on this subreddit, should have given you enough reasons not to play this game.   
---
I know this Hack is not your or Bethesdas fault, but as things get worse, I am personally loosing sympathy for people who are still playing this game by choice. 
---
###
---
If I remember correctly they outsourced it to a team that specialises in multiplayer games, can't remember who it was just now I read it a while ago, did you read otherwise?
---
They could do so much more with the crossbow on 76 it's one of the few pure stealth weapons on there.
---
Merry Christmas Mojave, Commonwealth and Appalachia alike.
---
Of course. And i don't like those minus likes. Watch video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NVUrge\_O0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NVUrge_O0)
---
Do such statements make you proud? You're a shame for our species
---
Except that's the dumbest idea because now you're using duped items which can easily result in a ban and/or inventory clear from admins
---
Mostly it start from minute 3
---
For the love of Christ, THE LATEST "STEAL INVENTORY" HACK IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE, IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE NET CODE! It's a .dll injection that forces the game to transfer all the items (in a pre defined list) from the victim to the hacker. For reference visit [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eeuzk4/as_a_server_programmer_can_we_please_stop_blaming/) a friend made, I'm sure you've at least scrolled past it. It's on the front page of r/fo76 after all.
---
The AMR is still a beast to this day and I dont think adding modern firearms to fallout would be to unsightly it's all about what you like playing with.
---
Such as?
---
Or forever. If you're questioning whether it's safe to log in to a game because the patch that fixed a hacking issue might break more in-game features then that's a pretty good sign to bail.
---
You're a fucking joke. All of you who made this game, and all those who support you. You should be ashamed.
---
It could work if handled correctly kinda like the perfect storm 10mm submachine gun which does burning damage.
---
To be honest i've cancel my auto-subscription.
---
I've been following the fo76 disaster since its release and i enjoy whenever it fails. I have mixed feelings between wanting it to die already or keeping the drama train going but its getting too sad to look at.
---
I hate the company and hate the business practices but also a great part of the playerbase is at fault. I am not talking those who just find enjoyment, but the apologists and those who are loyal and defend tooth and nail bethesda and shady business practices no matter how bad they turn or how little the company show they care. They and fucking whales are part of the reason why AAA industry is a shitstain and deserve to be shamed ostracized and hopefully will be rehabilitated. Star citizen is a great example. The fo76 players who defend bethesda or spend more money on this game are not victims anymore, they are complicits in making this world slightly worse and some people enjoy their suffering even if innocents are also affected.
---
You're going to make everyone rebuy what they lost, aren't you?
---
I completely agree there is a severe lack of handguns in 76 and personally if I dont like how a gun looks I'll be damned if i use it with my character.
---
Happens on the double barrel everytime
---
Did you ever stop to consider maybe you should've just stopped continuing this thread and just not replied? Because you went from looking like a high and mighty know it all to...well pretty much a dick
---
You chinese mate?
---
Someone needs to decompile and see if any IPX/SPX calls still exist.
---
Which bugs are you talking about?  The only one I heard was reports of scrap box contents disappearing in a few instances but Bethesda fixed that later the same day.
---
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on PC. Picked up a batch of ultracite ore at the last cave, forced quit, rejoined the same server, but the ultracite ore didn't show up to be activated again at the last cave. Happy farming console users.
---
So basically only play 5 year old games and nothing online.
---
I for one am honestly curious when YongYea, JuiceHead, LegacyKillaHD (each of whom released not one but two Bethesda-bashing videos about the hack), and other YouTubers like them, as well as websites that pretend to be "gaming news" sources that are extremely fast to jump on the hate train, are going to post videos and articles about Bethesda actually releasing a patch, offering an apology, and stating that they're looking into ways of compensating the people affected.
---
I guess those kinds of videos and articles wouldn't generate clicks and views, though.
---
Bloody hell, didn’t know this was possible. What a mirror of society this game is. This are 80s style streetgang tricks.
---
People can steal everything in your inventory, even your Pip Boy (breaking the character). They just need to be inside the rendering distance of your character.
---
Nah, it's winter so im keeping wrapped up warm and enjoying the game on console, sorry PC players lol
---
Gotcha unless your a no life reddit user then your not allowed to post on Fallout 76 reddit.
---
No, there's plenty of games that have actual stable online play, no hackers, and a competent dev team that fixes bugs without introducing more.
---
Yea. I feel like all I get are armor plans.
---
Merry Christmas to all the vault dwellers, lone wanders, and raiders. Wishing everyone the best for the coming year.
---
It would be cool if it could snow in game on christmas day 😁
---
I think you're high enough level to have a couple of ranks in starched genes if that card has appeared for you. Might consider marsupial mutation, it can keep you from getting mobbed. Serums not super expensive at player vendors...
---
The reason Bethesda doesn’t get praised is because because of how often the hacks happen and how easily they seem to be created. Even this latest hack over a year after the game came out Bethesda had warning that this was coming and they were still slow to respond once it happened.
---
See you for midnight mass in the church at Flatwoods.
---
TL DR: Big YouTubers and news outlets ONLY cover the bad.
---
Take off, eh!
---
No.You are not the only one who feels anxious about playing at the moment
---
Thank you to. Have a merry christmas lad!
---
Ehhhh if you dont spend money on it nor encourage anyone to spend money i see no harm have fun!
---
Tho i wish you would love a game where the company loved you back.
---
If you're ever looking for a player faction, the BOS Hellfire Chapter would love to have you. Feel free to pm me for info if you're interested at all.
---
They have to make the hack (if there is going to be a new one) which will take weeks. You’re fine.
---
I don't know man. Turn up your sound.  Hear them running up to you is important.  Keen sense of surroundings as Melee always flanks. always be checking your back.  
---
Do these things and you should see melee approaching well before they can hurt you. Then just froglegs and blow their head off. That's 99% of all my deaths right there.
---
I don't like using the word at all, but it seems to be what people are calling software servers these days.
---
Here’s my take on it. 
---
**Standard**: Gets the TENT as is (*like I wanted it to be in the first place, Bethesda, not behind a paywall*). Scrap Box available for CAMP/Workshops. 1000 lbs Stash. 
---
**FO1st**: TENT has a bed, not a sleeping bag for Well Rested instead of Rested, and also a Station to manually scrap non-auto scrap items (but no repairing) like weapons/armor/beer bottles.
---
2000 lbs Stash. Plus all the other stuff like the Private World, etc.
---
'Be pissed off at bad drivers, not at companies that sell cars with no crumple zone and no seat belts'
---
I'm just having fun
---
Can you guys just admit its Bethesda's fault? But ultimately YOUR fault? Since day one it has been clear thar fo76 was half assed, made to sell micro transactions and Bethesda only added more and more into the scummy things. Everyone still playing and throwing them money deserves every shit they are getting from that game. Let it fucking die.
---
Ironic much?
---
No idea. 
---

---
I once scrapped a fusion generator which had the camp unit on top and yes, you lose the thing. My only ( and painful) fix was to move camp a bit and then, back to where it was.
---
Hello? It's me.
---
The engine, which was originally written for multiplayer games, is not the problem.  It's the lack of server side verification.  The server trusts the client, which is a big no-no.
---
i have found that this random and changes every few minutes. at least at the spot where i was doing it (pumpkin house). Sometimes i got 1 per wave, sometimes 8
---
No.  This conversation has cropped up over ten-thousand times in the ESO forums, and it's about as fruitless here.  This kind of membership perk is there specifically to encourage subscription.  It's NOT something for a one-time purchase.  If you took this away from subs, what would you give them in return that was an *ONGOING* benefit that would even come close to being worth the exchange?  Certainly not 200 extra stash space.  
---
No.  Stop whining about the Stash Box.  Bite the goddamned bullet, spend the amount of a Starbucks coffee &amp; pastry.  Just sub or don't- but stop whining about things you think you're entitled to.
---
I’m surprised they let you build in workshop since they patched last time stopping from building collections there. Anyway also a good method!
---
&gt;apologize 
---
To be fair thats more a none apologize and then down playing how bad the hack was.. and when you need to apologize once a month for another screw up there comes a point when it means nothing.
---
You think you're disproving my point when in fact you are only emphasising it.
---
i hopped online ran to my camp like i was running through "no mans land"  and stored all my stuff off my character and logged
---
You even used the comma wrong...
---
&gt;few
---
Op the giant mask would be great! Too bad I don’t think you can put the hat on. You can wear a hat with the plague doctor mask though so that would prob work!
---
&gt;  and it has net code now.
---
Which is the problem -- the engine mostly works, the net code doesn't.
---
It looks like he's in the group in the video, so he can rejoin his teammates and go right back to the same spot.
---
oh my, I must have hurt your feelings, sorry mate
---
but the fact remains that the OP is a mess, especially coming from someone who claims to have 25 years in the IT industry.
---
and yes sorry, english is my 4'th language, so it aint perfect
---
So this method works outside the Glass Cavern too?
---
Yes on both. Icicle lights though .... Damn icicle lights.  I have about 150 gifts of various size waiting to be opened on me. If one of those doesn't drop those lights I give up lol.
---
Isn't that how most of the worlds media works? You have mostly the negative/neutral stuff and then occasionally some positives?
---
Varies depending on your location.
---
I've been looking for background music for my get together. 
---
It's perfect!
---
as for getting the historic sword, either A.) follow in the wake of a high lvl player or B.) tag the ghouls and run to the closest group of WS security and let them go to town ;-)
---
Gottem boys 😎😎
---
Tried on private server and ultracite never respawns to mine infinitely
---
Dm’d you a different method to try
---
Lemme guess, you heard from a guy who heard from a guy?
---
Probably Todd saw the Skyrim Together mod, asked a few of his guys to slap together a prototype of the same thing for the already in-development Fallout 5, and after seeing the demo decided to ship it.  
---
But because it was just a prototype, they hadn't bothered cleaning up all the client vs server separation of concerns or scripting dependencies, and probably ran into architectural or performance issues trying to convert it into a fully server-side system, so wrapped the transport layer in TLS encryption, added some quick checks to see if the client was compromised by known cheat engines, and called it good for Release 1 hoping to go back and clean it up later. Which they are now slowly doing, release by release and hack by hack.
---
Can we also blame the people still playing this game?
---
Why would you think that? O.o
---
They are enablers, they allow for such poor quality games and services to keep being made because they keep paying for them.   
---
Also, fo4 had a save feature so when it did go to shit I could just reload. Any long time Bethesda game player can tell you that saving all the time is crucial just to get past the bugs. 76 does not have that feature and Bethesda themselves never learned the lesson to save often. Now when they try to restore people's characters they have to go two weeks back.
---
"Stop blaming the players"
---
"Its your fault that bethesda made this because you keep buying and fixing it for them"
---
Wtf is the message here exactly?
---
Bugs
---
You give them the money. Of cause you are the main problem.
---
Well the glitches and crashes were annoying. But what got to me was the end game. Therr is none. Once you are fully geared that's it. You don't have anything to do. Nuke whitesprings or the queen for the 7 blllionth time? No thanks.
---
Notice a certain person whos name starts with V showing up near him a couple times at different places? I reported that person and ANOTHER person whos name also starts with a V for hacking during workshop PVP something along the lines of 8 months ago and watched as bethesda did nothing. interesting to see that person pop up again. What a total coincidence.

First, it's sow.  Unless you planning on pulling a needle instead of pushing a plow, you missed. 
---
Secondly, this is vague. The current outrage is the inventory exploit allowing folks on PC to strip you to your underpants. Is this an attempt to justify/rationalize that?
---
Yep. There's no way on Earth I would pre-order or buy ES6 or Starfield or any other upcoming Bethesda release after the year we've had with F76.
---
5* on a weapon card, 3* nerd rage if u want to play bloody.
---
"Stop blaming these guys"
---
...
---
I blame the ones paying them. They do what they do because someone pays them.
---
Thanks Todd!
---
Or you could uninstall this failure beta
---
Merry Christmas Guys🎄
---
Stop blaming Fall Out 76 players for the issues with Fall Out 76. Blame the people who enabled them to do this in the first place from back when they started using this buggy engine.
---
Bugs and glitches and cheaters and hacks that would seemingly never get fixed or at rest. One of the ones that always got me, was the insta death bug. The Fast Travel bug also became irritating after while. Eventually, I just found other games to play which were more stable and better maintained. I always thought I might come back to the game eventually, but it never seemed to get any better, only worse
---
I put about 50 hours in the first couple of months. Got my character to level 50. Despite the bugs, I actually really enjoyed playing the game. Two of my friends who I don't get to see a ton any more were playing it and it was the first game I was playing with them in a number of years. The first nuke that went off on a server we were on happened when we were at the Top of the World doing that quest line and we had an awesome view of it, it was a really cool and unique moment.
---
When they stopped playing the game I basically stopped as well. One gave up due to the stash limit being too small (I think it was 400 at the time) and the other couldn't handle the consistent network issues. 
---
I soldiered on alone for a while, but they nerfed the spawn/drop rates of legendary ghouls in nuke zones (which I'd really enjoyed farming for some reason) and then I had a week where I logged in 4 times, and twice had immediate network drops and the other two times had scorchbeasts spawn in on top of me. I have tried to log back in a few times. I never even finished the main quest and this is the only Fallout game in the series I haven't beaten, but playing it alone just kind of sucks.
---
Just because we paid for the game doesn't mean we are enabling them. We ordered the game the same as you. We keep playing the game. Nothing says that we pay for anything extra. I do purchase things on occasion, but I also purchase things for other games too.
---
I agree whole heartily agree with the save often sentiment. I always worry with a crash what is and isn't saved for the game.
---
Oh and something else to mention. Pvp. Basically if i used guns the game can currently provide its not viable. Legacy weapons melt players and they are getting increasingly rare. People don't trade caps for them anymore. They only trade other legacies. So if you don't have one you are kind of screwed. Makes pvp very one sided.
---
Considering this effort has been ongoing for the entire year of this games existence... The losers you are thinking of couldn't have that kind of dedication.. there is fuckery at foot here.
---
Ah yes, of course expecting a company to be responsible is just victim blaming.
---
I was playing solo on a private server.
---
Got to elevator grabbed a couple ultracite spots and then as scorched were coming I quit,  when got to home screen hit A to load it up and went back into a private server.
---
On second run through most of the scorched had respawned and the scorch beast was back but I could keep clicking on the ultracite spot I mined before quitting and 5 scorched would spawn each time I clicked it.
---
Added note: you do not need to server hop or a team for this to work. A team mate may contribute to more spawns if they are in there with you interacting.
---
So no need to quit game at all?
---
&gt; Nothing says that we pay for anything extra.
---
&gt;I do purchase things on occasion.
---
Are you aware of the contradiction here?
---
I have found that it’s more difficult. I find myself constantly over encumbered now, so basically I can’t fast travel anymore.
---
Beside the temporary santatron gifts, my camp open to all. The worst that happens is I give free water. All in preference I guess right.
---
I have it, and it’s never spontaneously created items. I like it for storing things like cranberry juice and Brahmin milk, since I’m not always needing those and I’m not running good with salt.
---
That's just a technicality. We all know the engine could be better as a 20 year old one. It just isn't.
---
Haha, tell  me if it works or he thinks I'm a horrible comedian, either way it's worth a try
---
To everyone bitching about how they worded a response: get the hell over it.
---
I wouldn't go that far, i don't think console players should have anything to worry about.
---
I'm not the one upset, you shouldn't be so dismissive of corrections if you truly want to learn.
---
Here's a free one; if you're unsure, go with less apostrophes rather than more, "4th" doesn't require one either.
---
Just sounds like this game really isn't for you. you don't have to like every game that comes out and it's not our job to argue with you as to why we enjoy the game and you don't. maybe you should put it down and give it a try when NPCs come out with wastelanders.
---
It's just the people who insist on launching minimal viable products, take in millions, and don't reinvest in the product.
---
Oh no, not your coat.
---
Here's the answer, from da man himself:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW9nsKQ7vdA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW9nsKQ7vdA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=879)
---
It is a good game now. Depending on how many bugs or issues hit you.  Frankly my experience has been nearly bug and glitch free.
---
Whoa there buddy. Its just inventories. 100 seems enough/s
---
So far i know. I read about it yesterday, but my question was, if someone got any help from support. Because they wrote to me they will write back, but i do not trust them.
---
&gt;Reply
---
I prefer my items back even if they offered me 3k atoms
---
Didn’t expect responses straight away but thank you everyone it’s really helping me decide whether I will ever get it and what the reality of playing 76 will be
---
Thanks again!
---
It would clear up the confusion for those who think "naked" includes wearing underwear.
---
This. Someone has put words to what I have been trying to tell people. 
---
What alarms me most of all is that these issues have been around since launch AND STILL NOT FIXED.
---
So the engine then.....
---
Can we get some TLDW recap..?
---
nada. This guy did insufficient testing and ported out a half baked youtube vid after stealing it from others.
---
You can, if you want reset servers if something seems off. We would do it every half hour as the bodies started lagging us pretty hard. But we never encountered needing to server hop.
---
Once again GTA online and epic tried to go after the major hacker with that route. They lost and hacker won. Also keep in mind American laws have nothing to do with this hacker since he is in Russia
---
Doomsayers be doomsayin’.
---
The players are ignorant of the massive problems and are enabling Bethesda to continue their shenanigans.
---
This will be how they compensate us, everyone gets 1000 atoms and a pair of customizable undies so you can spend your atoms in the shop to buy different stain types.
---
Who cares? They are actively trying to improve the game. Yes it is an uphill battle but stop complaining it’s not helping anything
---
I've made some really good friends on Fallout and I really love how helpful people are in this game. I'll never forget this guy who gave me 50 screws when I asked if I could buy 5 when I was first starting out. A little kindness goes a long way. Sure there's some assholes out there and the game has had more than it's fair share of bugs and stuff but it's still a fun game to me at the end of the day. I can only hope that Wastelanders goes well. I can't wait to meet Mort and any other ghouls out there.
---
My wife works with the local prosecutor, they take confessions at their word in real world too...
---
Oh, I did not know that! That is great to find out!
---
Client to server encryption won't stop cheating lol, you clearly don't know anything about cheating in games
---
And public servers are more of a tool to sell/buy/trade stuff )))
---
It's a shame you think your opinion matters to others.
---
Bethesda poured in resources from literally every studio they have, and still the games a buggy and hackable piece of trash. This video and Todd's own words disprove the common narrative that the devs never got any support and that this was an official project, which also goes against the line Bethesda was using at release of it being "A dev side passion project we are releasing for all".
---
Can't wait for the "Inventory Hack Prevention Tool" to show up on the FO76 Nexus.
---
Ok yes i get your point, not all cheating but it will stop the “stealing” type issues!
---
Basically, you're saying modders are to blame? Because they fixed what Bethesda should be fixing all along and now Bethesda is slacking with 76, because they possinly hoping for modders?
---
But this game hasn't any **legal** modding possibility. Nor any hope for "free labor" that is going to fix any popping up bug.
---
Hackers are guilty in this mess. Nobody asked them to do that. I'm not protecting Bethesda though. I'm sick of Gamebryo crap, and i think they should've create new game engine.
---
I'd enjoy some more emotes as well - I would love some specifically for NW since it's a bit hard to always say what you mean with emotes there. Armor/Weapon Here would be nice. I'd still like an "I'm sorry" emote for adventure for all those times people spook me and I slap them with my shovel.
---
So basically fo76 is under-prepared faulty product from the beginning..
---
Only the rich get tickets to the life boats. Have you not seen Titanic? Get on your door, peasant.
---
I’m in security and we will leave it there...
---
The hackers old forum posts and use of Russian language and cryllic script.
---
Bethesda never said mods would be impossible, they've just said they're not supporting them.
---
*sh8k bellie liek a b0wl fool of jellie*
---
You can't buy armour or weapons, unless you got them from eBay in which case that's your own fault.  Anything stolen that was an atom shop item can just be crafted again.
---
I've no problem doing so. Its how I run multiple instances of rdr2 online.
---
oh my god, the fedora on the right is exactly how I created my neckbeard, pistols assassin.
---
Didn’t realize it was discussed so heavily already. Sorry if I offended you, I’ll delete this post
---
How many times if the nodes are not showing would you suggest LIFT/Fast Travel?
---
Christmas  eve here but Me and the wife wish each and everyone one of you a  Merry  Christmas, have a safe and happy new year!
---
I think the message is that because players fixed the games for Bethesda, Bethesda never learned to fix them themselves. So, in a way, modders also enabled Bethesda to make shite games that don't work. They never had to make them work themselves, someone else picked up the slack. I do think this is a fair point.
---
I haven't saw the hack so I don't really know how it works but it's probably being run client side and the server doesn't even know
---
Congrats on getting it! I still haven't managed to do any of the vault raids yet. I'm fallin behind here.
---
&gt; As a server programmer you should know it is hard to distinguish  incompetent devs from competent devs working under incompetent  management. 
---
I can agree to this partially, but the devs are incompetent. Any dev that comes to work, sits at a desk, and deliberately works to release a broken product is the very definition of incompetent.
---
These may be great people, but their work ethic is truly horrendous. It's truly upsetting to know this is being intentionally done, instead of grouping together and literally walking out of the studios (plural, the kids in Maryland should do the same), and force management to stop this reckless behavior of selling $18 power armor in a broken game.
---
I'm done with anything done by BGS. Because Bethesda still publishes Doom (a great game) and Dishonored, they're going to get my money because these games deserve my $60.
---
But the dumpster fires that are now the Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchise were literally destroyed due to greed.
---
If you're a developer, no matter where you're working, and you're putting your name to garbage titles, do not ever send your resume to me. I will never hire you because you've proven you care nothing about customers.
---
I hope that last sentence struck you across the face while your incompetent boss is forcing mandatory overtime on you again.
---
Wake up. Band together and walk the fuck out.
---
The modern warfare sub they dont even talk to us or tell us anything .... you guys are lucky the devs say anything at all 😒
---
Wow someones drank the kool aid.
---
Yes they will respond. Maybe not right away given the amount of people that could be effected and the fact it is christmas eve.
---
Why don’t you just go the same route as Gearbox and just file legal proceedings? Surly that would maybe reduce future hacks?
---
You probably confused the hell out of the OP but yes that’s what i said without the tech :)
---
But to the point, it’s not really a solution.
---
Change your dying old engine. Change your new greedy way of making your games.
---
I am, so Im using the Fallout 1st server and only inviting the wife.  I have friends but I dont know anyone is real life so.  Waiting for a week to see how this goes.
---
Eh, what??? I am quite honestly flabbergasted... so you want to tell me that modders are the ones reponsible for the mess that is the current QC at Bethesda? 
---
Well sorry, the next time modders should just leave alone all the bugs of the main game which Bethesda didn't manage to fix **AFTER** x patches... and not only that - after all quest mods are also "just" more stories for the players to enjoy - why didn't Bethesda just put in more of those? Convenience mods? Wrong! Armor or weapon mods? If there would be more weapons/gear in TES/Fallout we wouldn't need those anymore either... 
---
You are shifting the blame to people who want to help and are twisting their biggest accomplishments into something horrible. I am honestly appalled by that behaviour.
---
Didn't even use a racial slur. You call yourself a gamer?
---
Not even for hackers, literally google Hwid changer
---
So 1/10 player base is a ''few'' for you ?
---
I am really with you on this. Like..how could your treat your kid like that??
---
Seems like you're the one triggered over others feelings. Lol
---
There's also a man who had a home in one of the towers and they steal his dog and he has to go find him :( But I think the responder who locked herself in that room in the airport is still one of the saddest holotapes in the game.
---
You too all best !
---
Never heard that one. 
---
2fa woldent fix the current inventory hack unfortunately
---
Everytime I play Fallout 76 with my friends and have hours of fun, an Obsidian fan rages on Reddit about it!
---
Thanks, I will check this out! I just found the character builder site someone made, which is awesome. 
---
Fusion cores drained fairly quickly in Fallout 4. I haven’t gotten high enough yet to use PA in this game, so I am not sure how quickly they drain in this game. The few cores that I have found out in the wild are all at 25% power or less.
---
I think it has it's own place but it's not somewhere I want to play often. I used my friend's server so we could farm scorched in the glass cavern but once we were done we switched back to adventure. it's more fun with other people around and I like visiting camps.
---
HWID bans do nothing at all, they are easily bypassed.
---
Sure, options are great.
---
Yes it is rendered client side. Client to server encryption means that the server will simply not accept the steal behaviour as the “client” that has the item being stolen has the private key.
---
So when “you” try to tell the server to move the item from my inventory to your, the server asks for “auth” and “you” can respond with the correct private key, the server then rejects the request!
---
No shit it got official development time. Are you next going to prove that fire is hot and ice is cold? The difference is experience in creating a game like this. Bethseda doesn't have a lot and build 76 the same way they would other games.  Which is fine for single player games but not so much for multiplayer games.  
---
Rockstar has the same level of fuck ups with GTA Online given how wide spread mod menus were and still are on PC to the point they have disabled certain features from the game to prevent abuse from mod menu and script kiddies.
---
It does, to the right people. Mostly my family and friends. If you're not one of them then that's not my problem. After all if you're still playing this game you're probably delusional already, or you're just after suffering.
---
https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk
---
I'm sure all three apply but that's a reality. This is why you need to build a solid game that isn't so prone to these kinds of people, because they are everywhere.
---
And try to look at Bethesda and why they made such a shipwreck of a game. Did they do this because...
---
1. They can
---
2. Because they don't care about their customers as much as their share holders
---
3. They are obvious \*\*\*holes
---
Eerily similar list and of course I'm speaking of management, not the developers themselves.
---
The systems that crash every hour due to their low end hardware? Can the consoles even run 21:9 resolution?
---
While I agree, their security is crap and not having 2fa today is amateur. A lot of people have had their accounts hacked and items stolen. However, the recent stealing hack wasn't a security flaw. It called a function in the game to open a person as a container and take all items (technically one by one). Good security won't fix that. Good server side checks would. 
---
Not disagreeing, just clarifying.
---
Nothing really just got tired of playing after 600 hrs. Def coming back for wastelanders.
---
Yes it would. Read my other comment to q6poq9p. By 2fa i am talking about client to server encryption with a client side key generation.
---
No, I'm not saying modders are the issue with this game. I'm saying that Bethesda's behavior is because modders have enabled them in the past. 
---
Its like having that sibling that keeps writing bad checks, but your parent's keep covering for them. Eventually your parents don't have enough money to keep bailing them out and then that is when it really hits the fan. The siblings reputation is ruined and your parents are broke.
---
While ultimately it is the siblings (Bethesda) fault, the parents (modders) are enablers. Stop blaming the people (current players) who are trying to cash the bad checks.
---
Some did for sure
---
Yes I do believe that the 250 dmg resistance while reloading does still break the primary legendary effect
---
Sucking the developers dick even though they keep mistreating both the game and their customers/fans really doesnt do anything except make it worse. Criticising (and rightfully so) a game and its devs for things that are so not right in any way at least tells them not to fuck with the ones buying their stuff.
---
I imagine you’ll get many more negative comments with your current title so I just wanted to add in that there are a solid (though admittedly dwindling) group of people who have played since beta. I really enjoy the game because I like building and gearing up characters and then having a world to use them in, so if that sounds like something you might like then it could be worth trying, at least during the next free-play days. Also I’ll note I’ve played solo for the whole time so if you’re playing with a friend it could be much more fun. The other side of that coin, though, is that since this game is very polarizing friends you’re playing with may drop out more easily than in other games people tend to grind out together. All in all~I would say definitely try it next time it’s free. If you do end up buying it, buy it on sale. Some people love, some  people hate it

Play it daily for hours on end with no issues. Neckbeard PC players big mad. Stay hacked, fedora.
---
Cool story bro.  Do you run around restaurants yelling at people for eating food you don't like too?
---
Go away troll, nobody likes you.
---
Are you sure they can't?
---
Then we are under no obligation to believe anything you say
---
There are shortcuts you can open after each section, doors and terminals but it’s a maze anyway each solo has a different layout haha
---
God knows what’s going with the damage again mr Gustys are always a pain anyway
---
And every time a news article is made about fo76 next major fuck up half this zubreddit rages at them for reporting the truth as, "hatemongers just talking badly about the game." Lmfao
---
If they are paying for 1st, could you also "let them know" from me?
---
Yes you can. I bought 1 month and my sub has ended and I can still craft the outfit and wear it on any of my characters.
---
Did this for about an hour And a half got almost 100 gifts from this used a private server with two teammates one that only clicked on the ultracite while the other and I cleared the mobs. It lags after hundreds of bodies
---
Offline single player mode is called Fallout 4
---
Yes, as a stealth/sneak player I'd love the option to hit/hold x (PS4) or something like that to have the option to rip the head off or something cool.
---
Someone hasn’t played the game in yet he’s posting here
---
That's hilarious.  Never saw that guy.
---
“Rage, rage against the dying of the light”
---
it's a small number of characters, if only because of how the current player base is a fraction of what it was on launch day ~a year ago.
---
So of course it's a small number of characters - relatively speaking - because there's only a few thousand compared to a few million characters they have databased that will never log in again.
---
I’ve clarified my post above.
---
The account hacking would be fixed by 2fa on the Bethesda web accounts.
---
The hack is technically a security flaw because there is no security....
---
I dont do frog legs I find it takes away from the game, its not challenging and i already know the other stuff.  Kinda hard to run when Im fighting a stupid npc and they come up on me.  Other shit i cant explain still bullshit to be one hit killed.
---
Uh, I got to level 54 dude.
---
I get it but that's kinda like whacky wasteland perk side coming out. I feel the same way when someone's wearing a goofy costume I'm like wtf and it does break the immersion it would be cool if they had a whacky wasteland server for ppl who enjoy that side of fallout.
---
No life Douchebags are out in force today lol
---
 I cant imagine my life being so pathetic that I hang around a reddit of a game I hate just to talk down to others. 
---
 Your parents should be proud.
---
Wow he played for a couple weeks, when was that?
---
No I don't, and I'm not a troll. But evidently unlike you I care about the quality of games, and I would like for people to actually enjoy games that don't just nickle and dime you for every penny they can get out of you. Fallout 76 is getting close to Runescape levels of monetization.
---
Odds are you will not get your stuff back. When players got their inventories wiped from raids, it took weeks or months to restore their character and it was an old backup 20 levels earlier. When people lost their junk from scrap boxes, they could not restore the junk so made the "scrap this box" care package. I bet no one will hear anything until after New year's, and the response will be some kind of care package with an assortment of God rolls. They do not have a system in place to restore lost items, especially at this scale.
---
There is so inherent contradiction since Op is referencing a general category with the first sentence (the general population that still plays 76 cannot be assumed to be paying still) but themselves in the second. Nothing illogical, but maybe frustrating to you for some reason
---
Blaming the engine is benefit of the doubt bro, the alternative is they are incompetent idiots who get alpha phase bugs over a year into a release and all deserve to lose their degrees and jobs for this disaster, take your pick no one even cares anymore.
---
Fuck me you're sad.
---
"which **may** have resulted in a **few** players losing items that their characters had equipped."
---
I just love the wording here. It just works!
---
So you don’t wanna answer my question?
---
What? The nexus has hundreds of mods for fo76.  Did you forget the whole interview Bethesda gave about watching the most popular mods on the nexus to know what to add?
---
Basically they had a very active modding community until they banned map76 creator for reporting a major security flaw that allowed others to steal accounts
---
I think it’s fair to say everyone has different expectations when it comes to video game. Even if a game is buggy, full of issues or manages to be a rock solid created game, all that matters is that it gives the player enjoyment. That should be the point of it all.
---
If it didn’t, game makers would have to rethink and do better next time right. 
---
It is a shame we all can’t get our own mind created version of the perfect game. But if every person was on the same page we would be living in a perfect world utopia.
---
Not placing blame or defending, it’s just how it is. Either enjoy it or find another game you feel give a much better experience 👍🏼
---
I don't see why underwear skins aren't in the atomshoo
---
I see the confusion, let me be more precise for you.
---
I blame the ones that kept paying AFTER the producers presented their worst product of all the time; that still has potential, but currently has value much inferior of what we already paid for.
---
*psssst your balls are showin*
---
#BUMBLE BEE TUNA
---
It's relatively simple to spoof a Mac address and it's a layer 2 protocol it doesn't get routed over the greater internet
---
&gt; Sucking the developers dick even though they keep mistreating both the  game and their customers/fans really doesnt do anything except make it  worse. 
---
TIL that releasing an update as soon as this issue was found to be major rather then just some ass hole talking online means they mistreat the game and their customers.
---
I played it for over 5 months casually and stopped playing only 2 months ago, so there. Stop your hilariously bad attempt at making it seem like I never played this pile of wank
---
Agreed, what's good far out weighs the bad for me. While I don't play quite as much right now, I still go in and play the holiday events.
---
After all this shit, nobody should give Bethesda any money at all. They sold their own reputation for a quick buck.
---
FWIW, people gsve gold and silver to the "pride and accomplishment" comment to maintain its public visibility. Otherwise it would have received massive downvotes then been hidden from sight.
---
That guy was duping like hell, Bethesda even commented on it publicly in here.
---
Don’t know why The downvotes? I’m just asking a question to the people who don’t play it anymore to get a grasp if I’d be one of those people reddit is weird
---
Anyway it does seem a very divisive game weirdly enough I will definitely try it on a free weekend with and without a friend I’m more the side of building things up towards a goal so I’m still unsure but thank you that helps a lot actually
---
I'm 99% sure I got Sturdy Metal something as part of this, yes.
---
Hanging around a reddit page talking down to others for playing a game you think they shouldn't. ..... Troll.
---
We have fun together and thats all i care about. Unlike your opinion.
---
After 50 u can move points or pic a card so it’s not a u
---
Huge issue
---
really great low key community , I heartily endorse it .
---
Hacked? Rofl you think I've played this shit show of a game in the last few weeks? That is adorable, I've been too busy playing much better games like the outer wilds, Diablo 3, Poe, etc.
---
This game is just to hilariously inept to not watch closely as it crashes and burns. Enjoy your shit tier game on shit tier hardware. Lol
---
Hoser
---
That's dope!
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I gave up with the stuttering on consoles is extremely immersion breaking and ruins the experience as a whole, like just imagine you’re sneaking in to PvP territory you contest the workshop and you’re about to VATS someone then the game freezes for like 5 seconds to come back to your character dead is beyond annoying is infuriating.
---
The way you describe the game as a buggy mess makes it sound like you haven’t played in over a year. Game runs fine now. PC is another store but that’s due to garbage people wanting to destroy the game.
---
But thats where youre wrong. Anybody who played any other Bethesda game knew this was going to be a dumpster fire.
---
FO76 buyers got what they paid for tbh
---
If you consider Yongyeah to be a major media outlet with 1 million subs then yeah, He's where I got the heads up about it so I decided to see what the sub had to say about it, this is the first time I've seen this sub so unanimously against bethesda. There are usually a few fanboy's but thus time it seems like they really fucked up letting this one slip by
---
It is a game about killing, raiding and cannibalising. Just start shooting or run. If you need safer spaces, well... you can join the Witcher 3 fever... 
---
I don't harass low level players, but it is difficult to trigger PvP in the game. The game is already safe enough. Only risk is some hackers stealing everything you own.
---
I will be surprised if they continue supporting it after Wastelanders.
---
I like the couple in the look out tower you find them dead in bed together theirs a few interesting notes about them in their. It was also where I encountered my first rad storm it was gorgeous from up there.
---
I don't get worked up when I get get killed as you have suggested here at all. I am however disgusted with the community managers for cheering this particular thing on when they so rarely give positive praise to any other efforts. 
---
Your insult tirade and praising of bodega just shows me where you are at with the community. There are better ways to bring attention to a hack than to unleash it on your fellow gamers.
---
And now they have an intern and a cat.
---
In that aspect they may be the good guys, but remember the fucking disaster that were the canvas bag, the customer support replies about it, the nuka cola dark rum or the fact that they still let this idiot ruin their image by lying and killing the companys reputation. And you should not forgive them just because they fixed one issue, the game shouldnt have launched like that anyway
---
Lets not beat around the bush here - it's extremely simple to bypass HWID bans (there's countless spoofers for a start) but this is Bethesda we're talking about. They somehow managed to screw up simple things in 76 and their Anti-Cheat is a simple string compare (literally). Do you ***really*** trust them to implement a working HWID banning system in the first place?
---
Knowing Bethesda it would ban countless innocent players first before they push a half hearted fix out.
---
The poor dude stuffed and locked into the fridge in flatwoods. Rough Holo.
---
Uh... it's still a buggy mess, man. Come on.
---
They have banned this creator for using these hacks and Cheat Engine. It was confirmed. So, no, mods are not allowed, as well as any other hacks.
---
Lmao I know you don't play, the hilarious part is you basement-dwellers hanging around the sub to whine like anyone cares. "ThE oUtEr WiLdS", really displaying your superiority there, Mr. PC master race. Enjoy your shit-tier life in your shit-tier basement.
---
Can we really trust everything Bethesda says nowadays? I mean there's still a chance it could be true but I can't take it at face value
---
At some point, yes.  I think it's 4 hours.  Could be 6.
---
One of the reason I play this game is definitely to piss babies like you off lmaoooo loser
---
He says nothing is saying that people are paying more than the initial cost of the game. He then says that he pays more than the initial cost of the game. How is that not a contradiction?
---
76: The never ending hunger
---
I think people down vote in hopes of getting people to stop commenting stuff but it can be frustrating since it’s the least constructive way to communicate I can imagine, especially since people downvote accidentally often enough. And yeah I feel ya. It’s definitely fair to approach the game cautiously
---
Who's blaming current players? Are they guilty by playing the game? Or buying from AS? Bethesda has failed with developement, hackers are guilty with their actions. That's it, no one else to blame.
---
I played from beta up to fo1 release you fool. Keep trying poor kid who can't afford a gaming PC.
---
&gt; There are a lot of issues with the game, but they really aren't any worse than the ones that existed in Fall Out 4
---
Yes, yes they are. In Fallout 4 I didn't suddenly lose all legendary gear I got from Super Mutants. In Fallout 4 I didn't suddenly get my inventory wiped by a hacker. In Fallout 4 your item stats wouldn't suddenly change because I reloaded a gun. In Fallout 4, we actually had NPCs. And quests. And an overarching story. And no meaningless grind. And no always-online BS. And no premium subscription service for a full-price game after a promise that all content would be available for people who bought the game. And Fallout 4 was on Steam instead of a janky unfinished Bethesda launcher. 
---
I could go on for hours here, but I think you get the point. Dismissing valid criticism because Fallout 4 did it (which is factually false) is horrendous, and you should stop. And you're trying to shift the blame onto the modding community now? For shame. The issue lies with the statistics that they can still see. The players that still play. The idiots who still buy convenience items from the Atom Store. The fools who were dumb enough to buy the F1st. 
---
Looks like all that's left is the mouthbreathers who are too dumb to correctly write the name of the franchise even though it's just one freaking word.
---
This has potential to be the best idea in 76 history!!!!!
---
What you don't understand is that by supporting this type of game you set a new standard that affects all of gaming, while there may be a small demographic of people who enjoy fo76 in its current state, if companies get wind that it is more profitable to push out lazy content as opposed to something finished, then riddle it with nearly every type of micro transaction available, then this type of game could slowly start to become the industry standard.
---
Imagine every game in the industry being as big of a shitshow as bethesda has become, and relying on its most core fanbase to keep them afloat while everyone else is just kind of cast to the side.
---
Yes, and I was just informed thatwas patched. 
---
My point remains that not all dupers are angels. Some of these methods ***are*** detrimental to the game.
---
Bethesda gave you a free santatron which produces endless gifts to share during Christmas and you need to make sure nobody takes one from you.
---
Man, talk about being Scrooge.
---
Stockholm Syndrome......
---
Mods aren't allowed? Better tell the games lead that as he said they were. Lmfao
---
Well your reply is a bit confusing so I’m not sure exactly where you misunderstand me. And I’m explaining this syntactically. The first statement is global, the second statement is personal. If the first statement was personal (I do not pay more than the initial cost) and the second was global (players tend to buy stuff from the atom shop) then it is a contradiction.
---
"Only a small number of players have been negatively affected" Holy shit, understatement of the year, did we not all see the vid of the one guy who literally server hopped and stole gear from hundreds of players? I feel horrible for the devs because they have to suffer through this during the holidays but the higher ups need to fugging take the game down for a whole week and redo the damn netcode from scratch or shut down the game all together so people stop pissing away their money while hackers steal there cash shop items.
---
No, you ARE a beta. Keep crying, poor old man who can't get a girl or multiple systems to game on.
---
250dr does not break the quad effect. Nice piece you got there
---
Just looking at the comments on that video show just how toxic people can be sure shame on Bethesda for the game but robbing the players of +100 hours of gameplay to get the gear and just lose it just in seconds is just wrong because haha lol funny BeThEsDa BaD.
---
I'm laughing now but that shit wouldn't surprise me l.. The people who have stuck a round through all this shit should get T Shirts
---
Don't blame the programmers, they likely did their best with the resources they had.  Blame the management who made the decision to put the wrong people on the job, and not give them the time and or resources needed to do the job well.  
---
The iron triangle is always impacted by management.
---
After the last "fix", I dare to say the first rule of the 250 DRWR club is you do not talk about the 250 DRWR club.
---
Oh. That still doesn't quite make sense though? fallout 76 players are still part of this problem, they're still paying for this scam
---
'The Engine' is a nebulous concept for laymen and a favourite scapegoat for people who has no idea what they're talking about. Popularly combined with the 'poor optimization' argument.
---
&gt; Blame the people who enabled them to do this in the first place
---
... So the players. I mean you enabled them to break their promise with cosmetic-only Atom Shop items. They looked at the statistics and justified the non-cosmetics "because people bought it" when they officially broke the promise, in the same blogpost where these greedy fucks announced Fallout 1st, which featured most of the promised features and fan-requests behind a paywall despite their other promise where they said "No dlc, all content will be available when you buy the game". You think you're smart pointing the finger away from yourself, but you're really just a hypocrite who doesn't grasp the full picture here.
---
So ur cool if I come get your present from under your tree? SWEET!
---
Because we got scammed. We got promised a game and got a buggy sandbox.
---
But why continue playing it?
---
Nothing, otherwise we wouldn't be here. Unless we're trolling.
---
This. They justified their broken promise of "cosmetic-only" Atom Shop purchases by saying that statistically, the non-cosmetics were doing well. The players still think they're seen as players, when they're really just a statistic that the Bethesda analytics department is jacking off to right now.
---
Its funny, cause dupers can dupe items, hacker can spawn and give items to people, but frickin' devs can't do anything? I do not trust this. They are lazy and Do not care about their customers.
---
Absolutely this.
---
I keep seeing this kind if opinion.
---
“Youtuber X is lying/wrong/jumping on the hate train”
---
Ok. Show us. Link us a time stamped video where they say something factually inaccurate. Not just a subjective opinion you disagree with.
---
This game is a train wreck. It just is. And every single youtube video i have so far seen on the subject simply calls it out for what it is.
---
It doesnt mean that people cant enjoy it, but enjoy it with a sense of realism. And dont diss those who call out the bullshit.
---
I feel my age is a factor in my comment. The fact is Bethesda made a product, you choose to partake in said product. You put yourself in this vulnerable position. You, like the rest of us happen to have done. But your comment isnt lost on me. Bethesda should've made a better product for its consumers.
---
Every game has hackers don't fool yourself. Even old games like world of warcraft still has exploitable bugs that can be hacked - I mean hell I was actually a paid tester for 4 years and 90% of my job was finding ways to hack the mmo I was working for and the team I was able to find new ones every week or 2 and there was only 12 of us.
---
Even large and older games like eve and warframe still have bugs and hackers and even games with unlimited budget like Fortnite has bugs and hackers - the simple truth is there is no such thing as a buggless hackerless online game.
---
Also Stable is relative term - lots of games are perfectly stable for many people - I've had 1 crash from fallout 76 in a month thus stable for me my friend however has a crash every few days. Where as when I play Warframe with him I crashed 39 times in a day. With millions of PC's (and consoles) all with different updates and programs loading different levels of internet access its nearly impossible to figure out every possible one into stable versions.
---
You hold the modders responsible... For adding to a game for free... Because the developer didn't do it... No. Just no. You should hold the developer accountable for that. Their lack of morals and laziness is not an excuse for their unfinished crap. Modders fixed it because Bethesda was too lazy to do so from the start. They were never going to fix their shit and we both know this.
---
Rofl I'll be sure to let my wife know that I can't find a gf, she will be quite relieved.
---
As for not being able to afford consoles? Rofl, just one of my monitors is worth more than all the current consoles out. Let me know when you can afford 3x 34" predator ultrawide curved gaming monitors. Each one is 1200$. Yet I can't afford 200$ systems. Rofl okay.
---
Red dead 2 is gta with horses stop putting it on a pedestal.  Rockstar has two of the most downvoted games in history, GTA5 and RDR2 for pc.  Using them as an example is disturbing and ill informed.
---
It’s really not though. I can play for hours on end without any issues, maybe a little lag but that’s the case for all online games. Once in awhile there may be a random graphical bug, but that also happens with all games. 76 is pretty consistent with other games out right now.
---
Oh so theyre redeemed now are they? The games still a crashing, laggy mess. Oh and dont say its playable. Jumping around a camp and doing 1 of 2 events that appear every 5 hours isnt "playable".
---
It was a stillborn to be honest
---
Don't think they will do that. GTAO doesn't give no shit about security but it's raking in billions. That's what Bethesda want to see happen. Minimum investment, maximum profit. 
---
And after all, it's PC only problem.
---
Why the denial?
---
Because I paid for it. Its like buying a POS car. I'll keep driving it until I can afford something better, or in this case find something better. The Outer Worlds was way to fast and I ran out of stuff to do too quickly.
---
I bet, every month, the bosses seat together and ask themselves "do we give up... or not yet?" 
---
 imo, the Fallout World had (and it has) enormous potential to become an "eternal" game, like WoW, or HS... but too many mistakes, bad decisions and poor management brought bad press and bad karma. Maybe a fresh start in a couple of years could be a  better option.
---
Ah great, thanks!
---
&gt; but remember the fucking disaster that were the canvas bag, the customer support replies about it, the nuka cola dark rum 
---
It is pretty telling that you have to go to literally over a year at this point to bring up issues.
---
JFC, nobody uses "rofl" anymore you fucking dinosaur. You sound like your "wife" is your dead mother strapped to a chair. Imagine thinking $3600 is big money, you poor Cheeto-stained peasant.
---
Damn im on XB
---
Are you really still complaining about canvas bags? Didn’t you already get your replacement? Lol
---
Anti armor. Medics of you r on a team alot
---
Merry christmas brother!
---
Dude, YOU ARE ALLOWED 5 CHARACTERS!!!  It is built into the game!!  Before FO1st I had friends mule over caps and gear....give them the stuff, log off, go on new character, log back in and get stuff.  If you are not doing it then you are in the VAST minority...literally everyone has at least 2 characters.  With FO1st I put my stuff in a suitcase at Berkley and log off, log on to another character and go get the stuff out of the suitcase...This is a known dynamic to the game that literally everyone uses...It is not an exploit, it is built into the game.
---
Pretty much whatever we want.  Lol
---
Even mediocrity takes effort. That's more than Bethesda is willing to do.
---
AUD$22.95 for it here, no chance I'm paying more than double the cost of netflix (AUD$9.99) for a crummy private world.
---
FO76 while having the loyalest playerbase ive ever seen  has a small and dwindling player count, at least on console where it’s “most played” ranking seems to drop every month :/
---
Support after Wastelanders is a big question on my mind. They haven’t released another roadmap after their first one a few months after release and they still aren’t through that one yet
---
Don't play your mind checkers with me, man! Is he not included in the "we" of the first statement therefor making a personal statement?
---
Says the kid that thinks buying consoles takes any kind of money at all. Rofl you are such a broke ass child whining about how mommy won't buy you a gaming PC and you're stuck with shit tier consoles.
---
&gt; The games still a crashing, laggy mess.  
---
Not for me. 
---
&gt;  Jumping around a camp and doing 1 of 2 events that appear every 5 hours isnt "playable". 
---
How about fast traveling around the map doing events, helping players and just good old fashion dicking around?
---
Modders shouldn't have to fix a game. They should be free to create extra content. That is why it is a mod not a fix.
---
Exactly. 
---
None of these issues are new. It's just that now, theres no free fix.
---
Thats our choice.
---
It’s not denial... it’s the reality. I have 600 hours in the game from launch... I have seen the improvements and stability brought to the game. I used to get disconnected constantly last year... I don’t anymore. That’s just a fact.
---
Anti-Armor. My Anti-Armor Gatling Plasma does more damage than anything else i have.
---
Wont be surprise if the terrorist have figured out how to attack private worlds
---
It is an issue. I have both placed in my camp and it glitches a lot. I also used to place two of each in any workshop my friends were building in and they always got annoyed because it dropped their frame rate.
---
Before the Great Hack. I was liking Vampire's explosive automatic weapons and vampires melee swing speed with a van/cav set.
---
Yes. Every NIC has a unique hex MAC address. Bethesda will not be able to see this MAC address, but they will be able to see their publicly routed IP address. Depending on how far these folks covered their tracks, this can be traced all the way back to an individual's ISP account. 
---
Honestly they should start handing out permabans via IP address, this obviously wont catch everyone, but should catch a good chunk of the less savvy script kiddies that aren't bothering to spoof their MACs or IPs. It is a quick and dirty first step until they can get proper anti cheat implemented. 
---
Any networking questions feel free to ask. I work in the field.
---
Your Netflix is pretty cheap...
---
Well you're wasting your time here then, as I am not pissed off. If anything I have a bit of pity for you being manipulated as you are by Bethesda.
---
Aside from bugs, exploits, disconnects, and crashes?
---
The big thing that turned me off was the loot system - I'm just kind of tired of the whole "affix on a base item" system that's been used by so many games, and got popularized back with Diablo 1.
---
It's just a shallow way to say a game has "millions of items!" - cuz only a handful of those millions are actually going to be worth picking up.
---
In Diablo 1, no one really cared about a Squire's Short Sword of Embers, because it wasn't a Kings Sword of Haste.  Just the same in FO76, no one cares about some garbage poison resist+50% durability boosting Wooden Armor, because it isn't Unyielding/Sentinel's Combat Armor.
---
Perhaps more over, is that the older systems like Diablo-style were dropping items with affixes like candy, but FO76 treats them as relatively uncommon/rare drops, or something you spend your daily-limited scrip on rolling dice on.
---
There’s not enough stuff in the atomic shop to keep whales interested.
---
How dense are you? Try adressing all of my points instead of the one thats easy to reply to. I honestly couldnt care less if it was the only problem, but its not that easy.
---
Again, 3600 bucks is nothing, you fucking pleb. Keep crying because everyone else wasn't as stupid as you and decided to play a game based on an easily-modifiable engine on the one system where it could be hacked. Stay salty, and stupid, you geriatric bitch.
---
You too !
---
Anti Armor and Vampires are pretty good for high health builds.
---
The next generation of consoles probably poses the biggest problem, because unless they port 76 over to them, the game has no future there.  And even if they did, the game can't hold up graphically to what the new expectations are without alienating the users who own it now.
---
We don't really have a precedent when it comes to Bethesda though.  I think many would agree they've stuck with 76 longer than most thought they would, and that's worth something.  On the other hand, when it came to Doom 2016, once a year or so passed, they never spoke of it again, and that game was a huge success.
---
Bye
---
Your reality, yes. The reality you chose to believe. The rest of us live in the reality where PS4 users have been complaining for more than a week that they are suffering constant crashes. Where we see posts here every single day about people getting tired of disconnects and bugs and exploits. 
---
If that's not your experience, I'm happy for you. But in that case, you are one hell of an exception.
---
Yeah, and yet people would happily pay it and praise Bethesda for it.
---
To be fair, for people who care little about value for money, the pay2win elements like the junk stash &amp; tent are well worth the cost.
---
Your points are complaining about some bad licensing deals lol.
---
Isn't getting their hwid a violation of their privacy? I don't think that could work since there are probably hwid randomizers.
---
Make a blueprint, that way you only have to stack them once.
---
To me, no, to Bethesda, must be
---
just inventories.. that was my whole bloodied explo collection of weapons. and vang sent armor set. so, it was way more harder to get than those friggin atoms.
---
The issues with fallout 4 carried over into this. The actual game engine problems are still the same. 
---
* You had to save often in Fallout 4 because it was buggy and you would lose stuff. The only difference is you can't force the save.
---
* The lack of NPCs and quests was a stylistic choice. It's hated by a lot of players and I get that. I too would have at least put in a few NPCs, but I also understand walking out into a wasteland with no one in it.
---
* There is always a meaningless grind in games that have any kind of resource gathering.
---
As to shifting the blame to the modding community you are missing the point. The fault falls squarely at the feet of Bethesda, but the modders that fixed the past games enabled this behavior. We got to where we are now because of enablers and not because of the people who continue to play.
---
I'm actually surprised the game has the player base it still has given the game's history. Wastelanders DLC for many is the make or break point for the long term life of the game.
---
You are in the zone where you feel overpowered for the forest, but underpowered everywhere else.  We’ve all been there.
---
To an extent, WS scales enemy levels.
---
Serverhop WS until the critters are lower level.  For now, probably best to avoid the god clubhouse.
---
And 
---
spend a few more levels in toxic valley.
---
I wasnt able to do WS non nuked until about L27 or so, and yea, it can be difficult.   I had a L20 vampire machete to help :).
---
The reality I chose to believe? Are you telling me I am actually getting disconnected constantly and in denial? Lol
---
Nuka-Cola underwear bundle - 1200 atoms
---
Take and defend workshops. Lots of XP and scrap and they're very easy.
---
I just started a new character about 2 days ago I bought a bloodied lvl 15 handmade and it shreds. Basically i go around whites spring sneaking around shooting the ghoul and sentrybots around the loopf from the courtyard to the golf course im level 48 after 1 day of doing this method. Hope this helps.
---
Those are probably the only things keeping people subbed tbh
---
Clickbait anti-Bethesda articles are not factual reporting... They list YouTube videos as their sources. There’s so much anti-Fallout 76 news because it gets clicks from angry nerds who love Obsidian. If Outer Worlds was so great, why aren’t you all playing it?
---
You'd be surprised how many apologists are in this sub
---
i wish i could give you an award for this.. oh, wait, what
---
Well i should have talked about the in game problems too if i want to do my anger justice. But i am a little out of touch becaue i havent played in a while
---
Sounds like you *clearly* understood my point. /s
---
At lower levels, doing events and claiming workshops pays well in experience.  With the new system you can fast travel to the big events for free, then just focus on tagging enemies with a shotgun or .38 pistol.  
---
Of course, power leveling with a higher level player is the fastest and a lot of fun.  Are you on PC?
---
Because the game itself is nice. Only reason I could accept all the disconnect, bugs, etc. But this hack and the way Bethesda is handling it so far is crossing the line. If they don't rollback the player id's affected, it is time to avoid Bethesda games at all.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/~/can-i-use-mods-or-other-third-party-programs-with-fallout-76%3F
---
Okay, "not supported". And some of them will lead you to ban. Insert some percentage of "not allowed" into "not supported".
---
Both players go to main menu....private server player invite friend to team from main menu (social)...server owner log on to private server allowing team only...other team member(s) log in to "play with team"...
---
Never heard of a "server programmer" before and not sure what netcode has to do with server side validation. It's the client itself being hacked, you can read the scripts released and see as much. The security on the client is extremely lackluster which is what they keep exploiting and something hackers have noted repeatedly. Server side validation is certainly good but also has its own limitations and isn't the catch all you're making it out to be. They validate JWT tokens which are technically "trusted" coming from the client since they're not considered modified. They obviously don't validate the impossible (10 legendary effects) but if your client is constantly compromised (a request authority in its own right) you're only fighting half the battle. Anyway, it doesn't sound like you are a "server programmer" but rather just giving unquantified armchair analysis about "low quality programmers" and "netcode", the latter of which isn't even related.
---
I quoted you....
---
Right.
---
Yeah my anti armor seems to be the way to go.  Any particular perks ur using? I have my whole character set up for bloodied and unyielding, might be time to re-spec and try something different
---
As far as the Intelligence goes, "One of the biggest changes to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system in Fallout 76 is that buffing your Intelligence doesn’t increase your XP gain." So no worries on the Intelligence. The event that gives EXP bonus is "The Path to Enlightenment" and provides an EXP boost for an hour. I've leveled a surprising number of times (especially at low levels) building in C.A.M.P and crafting items to scrap to learn plans.  As far as what events, I prefer events where waves of creatures spawn (my favorites are Line in the Sand, One Violent Night, and Uranium Fever though these can be difficult to solo at low levels, even more so if you're not playing on a Private server where other people can get kills too).
---
A little? You are quoting licensing issues from over a year ago.
---
The 6 regions have increasing difficulty. From least to greatest they go Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap, Savage Divide, Mire, then Cranberry Bog. If you're in and area that is too difficult, downshift to an easier region and grind a few levels (do events and explore and the XP will happen on its own). Makes sure you're always well-rested and have the best equipment and perks available for your build. Make use of the legendary vendor at Berkeley Springs Station in the Mire. And make sure your equipment has the best available mods.
---
Switch to melee weapons when you are in WS.
---
Yup.  Check out the dead mutants around... all have mysterious quills stuck in them....
---
" We would like to apologize to those of you who were impacted by this exploit. We want to make this right, and we are currently looking into ways we may be able to compensate you. "
---
They don't get that everyone who wants to play the game is impacted by the cheat, not only the people who got their items stolen.
---
You are doing a great job Bethesda! /s
---
Pretty poorly. What system do you play on exactly?
---
You're not wrong about the hypocrisy but OP is equally right. Too often players are blamed or are implored to play the game a particular way rather than focus that attention on the people who had caused/allowed for that situation to occur &amp; have the means to fix it.
---
Instigating Lever Action for Stealth Sniper build
---
just go private, take all workshops, build santatrons and ta-daa.
---
Your welcome.

Some one payed $100,000 dollars for that cheeto....   
---
My point is that things are worth however much some moron is willing to pay for them.
---
Yea.  But I also put on excavator and loot everything along the way, so I‘M getting some of them back :)
---
Fallout 4 has nothing on 76. Even if they did the kind of attitude that makes it somehow ok is poisen.
---
Anti armor and Executioner’s here
---
Yeah I know they had a junior UI guy from one team, an HR person from team 2, team 3 lent out two (the two they could spare because they were that good) net developers. 
---
There you can now say you had FOUR studios working on it. And perhaps with a little imagination still figure out how they came out with the feces fueled dumpster fire they did.
---
I got the feeling that after this fiasco, people won't see the name 'Fallout' with such respect.
---
Was it? Good to know.
---
Telling that i gave up on playing because i didnt enjoy it yes. I see that i sound very toxic in my comments so let me fix it: if you still play the game and enjoy it thats good and im happy for you. Many here clearly like the game and i dont want to take that away from you (not that i can anyway) but you have to understand that this whole situation shouldnt have happened in the first place.
---
That just doesnt though does it
---
Bethesda accidentally added in the ability to pick pocket in FO76 LOL.
---
I don't use a mic, so if I don't respond verbally,  that's why.
---
Great, so another band-aid until the next exploit is going to be found? 
---
You’d better rework the entire engine rather than just temporarily fix ONE issue out of thousands.
---
yeah i know right i've check wiki and thing like that and nobody speak about that , but it happen for me (atleast 2 time) so it's very strange.
---
"hell I was actually a paid tester for 4 years"
---
Wait, you mean you weren't getting banned for doing the testing for free?
---
Because this is the state of Bethesda's online security
---
Maybe spreading rumors is not helpful.
---
They should have already done it! Before the game launched...
---
How about 500 Atoms? Will that suffice?
---
I think I still have one at my vendor you can have if it's still there, I'm on the road for a few days though
---
So you play on a platform with inconsistent experiences because of the variety of different rigs out there? Hackers ruining the game is a pretty unique issue to PC. Xbox runs smoothly. Sorry
---
That it took four studio's to create this is a testament to their ineptitude.
---
Is you reddit name same as your player name? I'll look for your shop.
---
You're so wrong,buffing intelligence makes a huge difference.
---
Try it.
---
Did you use the level 15 handmade the whole time? I wrestle with always feeling like I should upgrade my guns and armor.
---
Don’t have first but def a good method
---
its not worth it on purpose because if the fridge was better than the perk players would definitely call it pau to win
---
Happy Holidays to everybody!!!! Hope to a wonderful new year as well for all.
---
I too am sorry that Bethesda allowed for this to happen. But oh well, what can we do!
---
Lmaoooo “manipulated” its even funnier when people like you think that’s what it is, you truly live in a fantasy world where you can’t comprehend people enjoying something you don’t
---
Yes, I'm on PC. 😁
---
Nearly as impossible to accomplish as the previous challenges months ago!
---
Take a look at the videos people have taken when they were hacked, the hackers always come in naked glory :D
---
Probably why I would never sub, I have a second old Xbox that I can use to make profiles and transfer stuff to, I don’t care for the tent, and the private servers don’t interest me when I can just join someone else’s whenever I need one eg to play the raid lag free (aka make the raid playable)
---
PC is a hack fest right now with people having their entire inventories stolen. 
---
If that doesnt kill the game, then the console generation definitely will.
---
For my full health commando i use instigating handmade and combat rifles for the basic mobs. For sheepsquatch and queens i use furious versions. Pick your poison on ffr/explosive. Vamp is cool, nothing wrong with it except do you really need constant healing? Instigating handles 99 percent of the game with 1 or 2 rounds.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
was it tho...?
---
My ps4 name is FiL-UK1, I won't be online till the 26th though
---
Yep still am im just about to hit max lvl then im gonna get my hands on a be version max lvl. The lvl 15 is brilliant the damage output is very good. But i have maxed out the commando perks and the vats one. Its a fantastic leveling weapon just the 5.56 ammo is the only problem as you will use a lot of it.
---
Because im a 1st since they released it and i never got any unknown person on my se've, like not once. Its just an urban legend, again, nothing else.
---
Full health, non auto , stealth rifleman/gunslinger.
---
My main two guns are Instigating Explosive.45 pipe rifle. (4k damage first shot)
---
Anti Armor Explosive Handmade (tears stuff up)
---
 My armor is mixed 3* Leather.  There's just about one of everything in there.
---
My .308 pipe rifle hits over 5k but super slow to fire.
---
Since this is based on the Fallout 4 engine, I imagine that these same exploits would be possible in Fallout 4 if it were a multiplayer game as well. 
---
If you take away the multiplayer exploit portion of it, the other bugs that exist are exactly the same kind of things I saw in Fallout 4. Stuck mobs, bad graphics loads, strange visual artifacts, etc. That is what I expect from a fallout game.
---
Merry friggin Christmas you filthy animals😬
---
Anti armor for general use instigating lever for stealth kills and either executioners or vampire high fire rate weapons depending on circumstances
---
They said they would support the game for years to come but we all know their relation with the truth so probably not.   
---
Since the latest problems I actually stopped believing Wastelanders will be make or break. It will be more like 'break or extend the lifespan for a few months'.   
---
I also see no improvement in how they do things. Testing is still a strange word to them. Also the knowledge about their own code doesn't seem to improve. They shouldn't known in advance that the halloween event would be too laggy to be enjoyable. I also read here that they were warned many times in advance that hacking could pose a problem but they did NOTHING.  
---
I was hoping they would treat FO76 as an opportunity to learn but I do not even see that happening. The same mistakes are made over and over again.    
---
So IMHO, the future of this game is grim. This time next year, the game will probably be dead.
---
Just wall it in entirely and remove wall to harvest. LOT OF WORK TO PROTECT MOSTLY CRAP.
---
Not 100% sure it's still there though I had it in my vendor
---
It's not just scorched, it's also ghouls and mole rats from what I've seen.
---
If I can't find it by then,  I'll look for you.  Thank you.
---
Doubt even Bethesda would lie about something that serious.
---
That being said, I'd love a lot more transparency on their part.
---
Todd could be to Bethesda what Jeff Kaplan is to Blizzard.
---
Instead we have a guy who's been the villain since release.
---
I doubt you do, if you did you knew that IP Adress bans solve absolutely nothing. Getting a new IP Adress is the easiest thing in the world, heck a ton of ISPs work with dynamic IP's that change every day. Can't tell you how often i went around the "This IP Adress may only download 500 MB a day" limit from filehosters by simply restarting my router and getting a new IP assigned. Sure not all ISP's do that, but even then you can set a VPN up in 5 clicks nowadays. Permabanning IPs in this day and age has exactly 0,0% chance of solving any problem at all.
---
Your fallout is pretty cheap..
---
Are there specific workshops that I should take? Like any that are close together?
---
Also, is there a timer on when you will need to defend? I took a workshop and felt like I had to defend it after maybe 10 minutes, then the next time it didn't happen for over 30 minutes.
---
I wanted to make take 2 or 3 close together and move in a circle to each one.
---
Final question: The munitions factory that makes ammo. Does the hopper only hold 200 ammo at a time? I left it for a really long time thinking it would have a thousand or so 5.56, but it seemed stuck at 200.
---
Or you just download a changer and have that emulate a different ID. That's the thing about PC's, you can change pretty much whatever you want.
---
there are pieces of that everywhere to secure compatibility with a lot of things if you analyze a little every windows version and sometimes those things hold back improvements
---
Took them half a year to get it right. Also the helmet got a callback as well. The way they went about responding was a joke. The mere fact they thought 5$ worth of atoms was a good way to say sorry? The fact that this shouldnt have happened in the first place? Funny, i know
---
Is there an easy way to get a handmade plan?
---
TSE and AAE. 
---
Also recently started using a Vampire laster gatling. That thing is amazing and appropriately called 'Immortalizer'. Dying with that weapon is impossible!
---
Micro / Macro / whatever the hell transactions are everywhere. The mobile gaming community has caused this trend. I don't care if you blame people for spending money on them for those type of things existing in the first place. 
---
What I am tired of is blaming players who currently play for the bugs that exist in the game. These kind of bugs exist in the engine because Bethesda wasn't forced to fix them in previous games. The Skyrim series also has these type of game breaking bugs too.
---
I believed it's spelled, l||lterate.
---
Oh man, you're in for a bumpy ride!
---
lmao kind of on you for supporting this garbage ass game, i honestly dont even feel bad
---
Happy Holidays!
---
Dude, thank you for posting this.  I was starting to get frustrated and wouldn’t have been able to say it as nicely.
---
This subreddit is filled with people who are self proclaimed ‘experts’ in programming/netcode/game design/hardware design/computer building, etc...  But yet, as you point out, lack basic understanding of their own computers.
---
Vault dweller xXx_**c**a*69_xXx has invaded your world!
---
Why you want your stuff back? Those raiders gave you a reason to play now while you have farm all the resources you lost especially those legendaries.
---
Honestly i do not know. I managed to get my bloodied lvl 15 for 250 caps 2 nights ago but im unsure to the availability of the plan. Your best bet is to try get one here. Im not sure on their price.

---
Unarmed with an instigating meat hook, death claw or power fist with maxed out strength and perk cards for one handed.  Combo of bolstering, unyielding and one life saving armor piece
---
Hey, if that's your thing, go for it. Some people really enjoy being kicked in the balls, doesn't bother me any even though I don't get it. If is your kink to play games because it pisses other people off, go for it. Have fun.
---
Players actually hack the santatron lock for presents? Omg.. we’re doomed.
---
I got the heavy.
---
even if it's not the main object of this thread , bethesda say the shop was for cosmetic only , and it's not the case with few item (including the fridge) , so better or worst than the perk , it's not cool and is a pay2win in a way.
---
You’re finally awake. You were trying to play the game. Right? Walked right into that obnoxious hacker, same as us, and that noob over there...
---
Welcome to Bethesda!
---
This hacker is committing theft/fraud. And the hacker is technically subject to the law of any locale where there was a victim.
---
$5 in the atomic shop incoming for all of you who got your shit stolen.
---
Yeah it should be private servers and mods but you know. Money
---
They managed to keep ESO alive through the whole F2P phase in gaming, and it’s been going for five years and still very strong.  F76 is cheaper to keep around, and as long as its earning enough to keep servers up or have people willing to rent space F1st I think it will stay supported.
---
There’s a bunch of other reasons I play the game, I just find it hilarious to watch people like you make a dozen metaphors about how playing/supporting 76 is akin to self harm or masochism. It’s peak pseudo reddit intellectualism and the most entertaining thing to read, it’s like if you bottled the pure essence of neckbeards and edgy 14 year olds, and then you get someone like you LOL
---
Does flux last longer as well?
---
1650 atoms costs more than fallout 1st monthly
---
I'm not defending Bethesda here, I'm merely appalled by the actions of a degenerate that violate both the law and morality.
---
That was patched yesterday
---
Same here.
---
Hit the uninstall button
---
Blame the management that doesn't allocate a large enough budget for quality devs. You get what you pay for.
---
People who give money to Bethesda are horrible tbh
---
it's unique, great community that other games don't have, and it doesn't feel like a generic MMO where you have to be end game to have fun, you can be, do whatever you want  
---
It's also fallout man, I loved 3, NV and 4, so I gotta love this game too :P
---
Well this is super nice to see. I'll be on later tonight. I'll be looking for ya
---
It's official, I'm dealing with a moron. Nice try though that was almost funny. If you try that outside thing i was telling you about outside today make sure your mom dresses you warm and don't let her forget your helmet.
---
They won't do it again, there will be no fresh start in a couple of years.
---
In canada saying things is criminal lol
---
People still play this game? I guess this is where the masochists gamers hang out.
---
To Bethesda “a small number” prolly means at least 40% of the players.
---
Personally I’m not playing until I know 100% that it’s been dealt with
---
You don’t understand, it’s OK though.
---
I do the sneaky thing and generally use an aae handmade and executioners fixer. I also have other legendary handmades, one furious and one instigating. They all do just fine against most enemies, and I'm not mine-maxed really. Other than the obvious perks (tank killer, bloody mess, covert operative, etc.) I swear by having three points in adrenaline. Some say just one will do, but I'm a contrarian.
---
I enjoy the world and lore.
---
Atoms are free if you play the game.
---
Yikes why
---
&gt; Telling that i gave up on playing because i didnt enjoy it yes. 
---
That is fine. Enjoyment of anything is subjective. However you specifically mentioned launch issues. Canvas Bag they got ripped over with plenty of law suits lining up so they gave out the canvas bag anyways. Doubling the cost because they shipped the nylon bag and then canvas bag at their own cost.  The Nuka Rum was licensed out to a 3rd party that developed the bottle and the rum.  Bethesda doesn't own the brewery nor the bottling company. 
---
And let this idiot run their image statement is so vague I can only take a guess that you are talking about Todd Howard. Faces of companies are suppose to up sell the product they are selling. If Todd pisses you off then you should go into a rage induced coma every time you see any advertising. Because sure as shit places like Mc Donalds plays ads and acts like their food isn't low quality shit food. According to the ads Mc Donalds would have you think they are serving high quality burgers.
---
I just cannot seem to get the ultracite to bug out.
---
I really hope they treat it like ESO and constantly add updates. They may be far apart but at least the time spent wont be a waste in the end
---
Hey can it be crafted as well? Kind of surprising if you can craft and drop multiples 
---
 It then again ‘surprising’ is relative here
---
Assuming you can put the flux in there yes. But since it doesn’t accept stacks you’d only be able to store a maximum of 15 flux
---
Yeah don’t think I’m resubbing, gonna hoard junk into my scrap box before since I heard you keep it and can only pull stuff out afterward
---
Haha! I think it’s hilarious that people that hate Fallout 76 join Fallout groups just to spread their hate! 
---
This isn’t even constructive criticism... it’s just crying and bitching. 
---
Go find a game you like and purge the toxicity unless you can’t and that’s why your mad... lol
---
Example?  Proof?
---
Yall ain't got nothin worth saying. Your sister is waitin in the wood shed Bobby Ricky
---
You're 100% wrong. The only time the ban with duped items is when they are in large quantities. There's no way of knowing if an owner of a duped item knew they were receiving one or not.
---
Vendor in Harper's ferry for sure. Think one of the whitespring vendors may have it as well but don't know which one.  Be prepared to spend around 2000 for it though.
---
My eyes. My fucking eyes!!!!
---
wouldn't the playerbase be up due to more freetime over christmas? thats usually what happens with other games I play.
---
Yes, the vendor in Harpers Ferry sells it.  Possibly the free states vendor in Whitespring as well.  Around 1700 caps or so.
---
I rename the good ones so I don’t accidentally sell them
---
Just kill them when they go wanted
---
Sure. I call my handmades Tock Tock, because they sounds like this when i firing them :D The explo heavy's name is "Plasma BooBoo"
---
My LMG is "The Bitch" and the legacy laser rifle is "Death from Above"  
---
And now you can stop laughing.
---
As an employee for a triplE-A company which I won't name (kappa) can we stop blaming the programmers that just do what they're told and instead blame the investors and company owners?
---
Seriously, the programmers have absolutely nothing to do with dupes and hacks. The piss poor performance is what you can blame the CEO for since he allowed it to continue in post-production even though QA were complaining about it for months.
---
But when you make a multiplayer game especially one as large as this from a huge publisher, you hire crappy programmers and try pay them even worse to write the authoritive side of the game because your purpose is to make more money not to make a good product, and you'd rather fire employees than continue their contracts after the 6 months are over because then you'd have to pay them more. 
---
CBA to edit the rest of your thing. But yeah. It's not the fault of the programmers, they're just doing what they're told or as much as they can for the salary they're paid.
---
The next time you go "man... this bug could be fixed so easily" perhaps you're right and it would be but the devs weren't allowed to.
---
Yeah, I was one of the unfortunate ones. I was told I needed to submit a ticket this morning (GMT) but tbh I guess I’ll have to see what happens with it
---
Right... people don’t have to keep exploiting the issues but many do and many more profit from it. I’d say call those players out.
---
Yeah I name all of mine, my shovel's name is Gravedigger.. not very original I know. But I named my bloody radium rifle Fever and my handmade's name is Marilyn which is what I've named my rifles since Fallout4. I wish it would show us what players have their weapons named too - I always think it's interesting. Then as far as trading you can just see the actual name if you inspect the weapon.
---
I hear ya there! I also mark them faves if they're in my inventory.
---
oof
---
Naturally, all my shotguns have a variation on the name “boom stick”
---
why are you reposting the same thread several times a day?
---
Technicly bethesda said that they patched it.but knowing their track record it is better to avoid public servers. Better safe then sorry.
---
I can't see you point, there is a GIANT WALL OF TEXT blocking my view
---
Love it!
---
The community is amazing.  The game is fun.
---
Is that what is going on here? I mean, I love bashing on 76 but these repeat posts are just lazy.
---
Not a frequent player but I help the new players out by giving them kinda like a starter kit of scrap my base it's set up right after you leave vault 101 kind by the overseers camp it's really fun lol
---
Oh I am a bloody/unyielding build myself. I just know those two are what others go for. I made a solid attempt at a high health build once but I didn't like it. I'd rather have the health of a leaf and be able to hit like a truck.
---
In Russia the game hacks you
---
Well, of course! I've got an exterminator explosive I just can't come up with a good name for it.
---
whoops, yes should have added an advisory before I tagged that post. It is actually worth the headache to decipher :)
---
Kicked in the crouch? At least I can get ccx around the +250 dam resist reload bug while being kicked!
---
Thanks! It would have been great if Bethesda had rerun Fasnacht before Christmas, since a lot of the decor is suitable. I only have the one garland and a small flag, but the single piece garland and lanterns would have been fantastic.
---
I’ve never read something so wrong in my life.
---
Weve seen the 'fix', leaving it how it was is sadly the best option.
---
But then you are deleted, so how would you know you were not fine?
---
Named my Junkies FFR 25 Handmade “Crackhead”
---
lmao is this game from 2004? what's with the graphics?
---
They patched it yesterday.
---
So it doesn't show up when it's in a vendor as said name? Lame. I've been wanting to rename the legendaries I get that I do not want and just sell them. 
---
Make Legendaries Great Again.
---
I have a junkies explosive pipe pistol I named after my ex
---
Honestly Bethesda, just find out who is doing this and start taking every last Hacker to court.  Drain them dry. Get them JAIL TIME for this bullcrap.
---
I love FO76, and I viciously push to get those hackers RUINED for the bullcrap they've done to the game.
---
I used to name my two shot handmade "Double Trouble" although I retired the name when it went from 2 shot to 1.25 shot.
---
The only viable name, either that or dopehead (more or less the same thing though)
---
For someone who ‘works in the field’, you don’t seem to understand the concept of ‘DHCP / PPPoE dynamically assigned IP addresses’ and why IP bans would be pointless.
---
So now we’re calling ‘rebooting your router to get a new IP address’ spoofing?
---
‘Spoofing’ IP addresses doesn’t work like how you think it does.  
---
You can’t ‘spoof’ a full TCP connection without MiTM the path between your victim.  TCP requires three way handshake to do anything beyond just send the initial packet.  It is a stateful protocol.
---
UDP is a stateless protocol with no handshake.  You can send UDP packets and the receiver will happily accept them without any kind of verification or concept of a ‘connection’.  ICMP is the same way.  The packets will not return to you since IP routing on the internet will send the resulting responses to the real host.  This is how DoS attacks are so effective - you spoof the src address on UDP and ICMP packets and the victim takes the brunt.
---
There is one * to this though - being able to announce out other people’s IP blocks with BGP.  But, this is beyond things people here would understand or be able to realistically accomplish.  Requires an internet connection to a provider that supports BGP to customers, LoAs, an AS number, contracts, and wouldn’t be hard for your victims to come after you given that your fake announcement would have your unique RIR ASN tied to it.

It takes away the greatest strength fallout 76 has, our fellow fans.

Sear amount? I like mine medium rare...

It is my opinion that after the release of wastelanders the game will receive no updates other than those to the microtransaction Atom Shop. Bethesda has employed the concept of  "minimal viable product" at every stage of this games life and once wastelanders is out they are off the hook for any promises of future content.

Trump said windmills cause cancer during a campaign rally/ ego circle jerk.  His press secretary refused to answer any questions about if windmills do, indeed, cause cancer.  And if so, where the President, who's studied them more than anyone, got his data.  Because this is the darkest timeline.

The only way anything is going to get fixed is if we let the game die and stop buying their products. Hurt them where it matters most -- revenue. Don't buy a Fallout 1st sub, don't buy ESO, don't buy Skyrim, don't buy Wolfenstein, don't  buy anything Bethesda. We as a community, as gamers as a whole, need to stand up for ourselves and say enough is enough. We're through paying top-dollar for what is little more than lies. 
---
There's nothing do be done about this game, at its core,  it's a bugged mess and Bethesda knows this. Stop playing and let it die. The time sunk fallacy is a loss we'll have to take, some harder than others, myself included. Hell, I've submitted multiple support tickets about the canvas bag I still haven't recieved. The only way this game is getting "fixed" is by Bethesda Game Studios putting the love and care into this game that it should have gotten from the beginning, with a new engine, new assets, a real story -- giving us a new game. But that can only start when folks  start saying no to BGS' theivery with actions, and not irate, curse-laden posts on Reddit.

Because I enjoy this game. I've made a few really good friends playing and we have a great time together and always help each other out. We've recently been jumping into nuclear winter which is really fun as a team and of course we've been farming the Christmas event and we like to build camps together as well. 
---
As for your second question - not too many games interest me anymore. I don't care for the Skyrim world/setting as much as I enjoy fantasy - it's just not for me. So I'll just play this until the next Fallout installment, however long that may be.
---
It will definitely go into the next decade.

Ah, my friend! welcome to your first sip of Nukashine...it gives you wings!

Do you mean companions? That's not possible. Yet. (we don't know if or when it might be)
---
You were given Nukashine.   
---
As for robots, do you mean like a companion? Those (to my knowledge) aren't a thing in FO76
---
The exploit utilized in the tool released yesterday was patched server side... however, I've been told by those more tech/code literate than I that it is definitely still possible to place items in peoples inventories, and so other "manual" workarounds may still be possible.

Yes the ammo caps at 200 - you need to take that out for it to produce more so you should check it regularly.

---
&gt; We would like to apologize to those of you who were impacted by this exploit. We want to make this right, and we are currently looking into ways we may be able to compensate you.
---
This should worry everyone, literally. The wording here can mean they may not restore lost items and inventory except atom shop purchases. Even worse, it suggests they **can't**, meaning there is no way of tracking what's lost, but atom shop stuff might be a manual *"they bought this and that but it's missing so let's restore just those things"*.
---
No if you put it in a vendor or if a player accesses your inventory it shows its default name (except for sometimes for me it flashes the names for a brief moment before switching to default)

“News” video posted today, doesn’t mention fix from yesterday. If one wants to create “News” content, they need to make sure they have up to date, accurate information. This guy is a hack.

That hack was patched yesterday.  Per reports the only portions of that hack that remain viable are the ability for hackers to put items in your inventory , not take.
---
But, a hack that allows users to buy out your vending machines for 1 cap each is a thing...
---
It's fixed when people get their shit back

100% agree

You and me and many friends I still have today, whom I met playing SWG. That experience was incredible.

Kinda used to it. You will usually spot some mobs that regens hp all the time even if you spam nukes and ammo.

P. S.

Come up with a original fucking question next time...

This works really well. I also built collectors for the resources I want, and powered up the ammo factory and fusion core machine. Ended with 100+ gifts, around 20 fusion cores, and a couple thousand rounds of amo. Not to mention the lead, acid, and aluminum. I sell the excess plans as well. There is really no loss to farming this way.

They patched it yesterday -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eepvot/an\_update\_on\_the\_current\_pc\_exploit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eepvot/an_update_on_the_current_pc_exploit/)

I would say that the chances of some catastrophic happening are roughly the same as they were a month ago. Take that as you will.
---
I dont think so.  Stay on private or NW.
---
So play now? That’s how it works. You play now and stop later.
---
Well, now Bethesda can ban us if hackers put modded legendaries or stuff that we shouldnt have. Alright..
---
What information is your opinion based on?
---
That’s the point

OLD news on fallout 76 hacking.

Yes, as long as you were within render distance.
---
And the option to remove your tent from the world... it always has to be placed somewhere even when you don’t intend to use it, let us store it away
---
No wonder there are hackers all over the place in this game, because toxic assholes like you.

TSE railway rifle for free ammo and either a TSE or executioner's ffr handmade when things get too crazy for the railway.

The canvas bag should have shipped the way they advertised it. Same with the nuka rum. They knowingly advertised something they didnt plan to ship. They ordered those two things so they knew what they were getting, im sure. And about Todd: He promised a game knowing it wouldnt live up to expectations. He tried to devalue criticism about the shitty launch by saying that this happens to everybody. In a way, yes - but not on that level. It all just has a manipulative tone to it and i dont like that.
---

Heavy guns are a really good build if you don’t want to go bloodied. So meany cool weapons and most of them are actually fairly balanced and good unlike rifles were you have the handmade fixer and lever for the only good ones

&gt; Fallout 76 is not the first game to be hacked on PC,and it certainly wont be the last.Hackers are going to hack,They have been doing this since the age of the internet.

Please, please. Sincerely, as somebody who's been gaming since long before online games were a thing, point out to me any online game by a AAA studio that's had cheating issues this severe, this consistently.

I have a hard time getting mad that all my stuff was stolen... I feel like I am asking for it just because I am playing such a waste of a game. Bad security, bad engine, bad story (albeit somewhat kind of enjoyable), bad developer (now, used to be fantastic), bad everything...
---
When was the last time Bethesda put the gamer first? When was the last time Bethesda cared more about gameplay than income? Why should we care about the integrity of their servers when they rape us monetarily and without a sliver of remorse? 
---
I say PC users should all download this hack and go nuts. Show Bethesda how bad their game is.
---
(I should add, the theft of atomic shop items is in NO WAY ok in the slightest. That's pure theft.)
---
The netcode \*is\* the engine. Also, they took the netcode from quake and ported it in. The problem \*is\* the engine though because it was never designed for multiplayer so they added a ton of crap on top of it like everything being client side but the server validates it every so often. Overall, its exactly what I expected from bethesda (terrible engine, terrrible code, passable game)
---
Probably until another TES/FO style game comes out. Gameplay loop in these games is very fun and addictive. Personally cant even tell how many times i restarted skyrim, fo3,nv,4 after saying i was shelving for good.
---
Borderlands really didnt seem to take that many or all of players from looking at my friend list, and that was a spectacular game.
---
TOW was a great game as well and the supposed 76 killer but was very much overhyped. Most came back within the 20-30 hours it took to complete, myself included.
---
Anthem was another suppossed 76 killer and well....
---
I will say i am looking forward to wasteland 3 after seeing its trailer so who knows.
---
Nothing other than my own observations of the development and handling of the game thus far. There was a one month span during the games life that using power armor had a good chance of crashing the game. They still cant fix the DR while reloading bug, and when they tried they broke everything else. A general lack of new content since the games release other than the wildly unpopular (and dysfunctional) vault raids and some merit badges. The complete lack of end game content other than dress up time. That the game has been universally panned and mocked across all forms of media.   
---
I just imagine that Bethesda can't wait until the day they can wash their hands of this and that day is when they release the last bit of new content that they have mentioned, Wastelanders.
---
Merry Christmas, Wastelanders
---
Notice the radio silence since Bethesda's patch.
---
Looks like you're having a bad day huh? Did you get your whole fucking inventory wiped? I bet you did.
---
I will never understand the people who don't play but feel the need to comment.
---
If you are getting your info from the likes of youtube it will never be safe to come back.
---
get fallout first
---
The game is ass just stop playing it
---
Wait so the hotfix prevents someone from taking things from the inventory but not putting things in the inventory?
---
This game is legit a joke.
---
being able to steal people's items
---
Fair enough
---
I like random loots. That's why i actually play this game for. But i hate Bethesda that they making this game even more fifficult and legenraies do not spawn that often any more. The vent with schorched is very good, but now i am running naked bcs i was hacked like hundreds of other people and Bethesda is still doin' nothin'
---
Any Perks that reduce ammo, chem, food weight are a good call. Also always make sure to sell or drop any ammo you don't need or use, like mini nukes, missiles, plasma cores.
---
Nope. PS4. Try again, try-hard
---
Personally if I have too much of one material I split it in half and drop half or give it to a random to open up stash space
---
&gt;video evidence of roughly 500 players getting their shit stolen
---
&gt;"a few players were affected"
---
ok
---
happy cake day stranger
---
why?
---
The constant stream of remarkable missteps. The game is like Side Show Bob stepping on rakes for all eternity. Just when you think they have made the biggest mistake possible, they come up with a new and creative way of just bungling the whole thing. It is a comedy of errors, a perpetual train wreck that I cannot tear my eyes away from. That is why I LOVE Fallout 76.

Takes time to fix and devs working on holidays must be a pain
---
I agree, and everything i use now feels like it does no damage. But ive been running that build forever and want to try something different
---
Except there isn’t. Nobody knows how many have been directly affected by these arsehole hackers but the video shows about 50 people being attacked, not 500 as stated. This is how misinformation is spread. 
---
Bethesda obviously has to get a hold of the situation but I direct more anger at the pathetic hackers themselves, not the company and the players being victimised. Many on here prefer insulting players for playing the game and bashing Bethesda
---
Meanwhile......Bethesda doesn't care bc they're making a bundle from the Atom Shop.😬
---
That really bothers me, Zexis. I am fairly certain the devs actually writing code for 76 know how broken the game is. I doubt that there isn't at least one person on the team who cares about the quality of their work. This has to be enormously stressful being pressured to release something you know, as a developer, simply isn't ready for release.
---
I meant gameplay wise
---
Fake
---
I have actually seen a duplicate MAC address on 2 cards on the same network once. So it does happen. It’s extremely rare
---
Yeah i have a quad explosive harpoon gun that wrecks everything. And the free ammo is nice too!!
---
It never took more than 3. If it takes more than three consider a server hop. It was never required for us though.
---
WHO TOUCHED SASHA
---
" For those who downvote information for the masses..., why?  No negative  views or bashing here.  Just information to help, hopefully "  
---
Actually, people here downvote anything that doesn't shit on Bethesda too
---
Ohhhhh, hmm. I think power armor is pretty cool i guess.
---
Figure out which scrap you need and toss/sell what you don't. Make an alt for spare weapons/armor that you don't use everyday to keep it out of your main stash. Always keep an eye on your misc tab for improved repair kits and use them - don't forget that gun powder goes to that tab as well. Use it, stash it or sell it so you're not dragging it around. Use Good Doggy perk or carnivore so you're only eating 1 type of food. Sell the drugs/aid you don't use to vendors.
---
I've always wanted to find an MG-42 and name it The Third Reich or Blitzkrieg
---
Tbh engine for gameplay itself feels also quite clunky and janky compared to the ones around this moment except this architectural problem but that doesn't even seem a problem at the moment..
---
That sounds amazing
---
Maybe he lived or grew up in Russia, who knows? That hacking website will have his details. But even if they're false, get him banned from their forum, and take legal action against that forum / give them some unwanted publicity too.
---
Fallout 76 is a garbage game and will not last. Bethesda doesn't care about supporting this game. Move on.
---
I have no idea why you’re getting downvoted.  Makes no sense to me.
---
Ah wish I could help you out. All my friends are bloodied as well so I don't know anyone to ask for a build :(
---
I’m used to high sensitivity, already had it up, raised it all the way, definitely seems better, but it still feels wrong. Only real combat I’ve had so far was someone with frog legs though so who knows.
---
&gt; What is your favorite thing about f76?
---
It never stops to surprise me!
---
I do have to say, if they're able to patch it today, that's a pretty impressive timeframe.
---
The inventory hack has been resolved
---
To be fair, that game had major buzz.
---
Agreed. Perma-banned but also taken to Court. MAKE the hackers learn from their bullcrap actions.
---
If you go into the atom shop and look at the items that were limited time only that are expiring today it should tell you how much time is left til they reset - that's when reset is.
---
My theory is, it took so long to make this kind of hack because it was meant to push Bethesda taking action. The people that knew from the start how to do this were not concerned by the lack of security before that.
---
They are still the same. They change Tuesdays at 7pm EST.
---
Can't say ive experienced this before, and I have 4 characters that are 800/800 in stash and over 1k in holding items, so not sure honestly
---
I like the game. I don't know why, but I do. I think I like it because I know the potential of it. It could be fantastic! My deal is purely against Bethesda's treatment of it's player base. 
---
They gave us a broken mess and then abused a monetary system that exploits the gamer. They deserve whatever happens to them.
---
I agree with lack of content for endgame. 
---
For perspective, they have only added 1, thats right 1boss world event this year. Thats only 2 world boss events (sqb,imposter), when we have so much cool lore to use in game(mothman,grafton monster,etc).
---
I enjoy vault raids but most of my friend list dont even try it anymore due frustration from the stupid timer mechanics failing raids, ie, buttons failing to respond, pipes not repairing when it fist came out.
---
I love being able to have a pet at my camp. Just wished they had protections so they couldn't be killed, it's too time consuming to tame them to only have them at my camp for a few minutes.
---
Then why are you even in the reddit for FO76?
---
I feel like most people around here are more interested in Sims: Fallout Edition than in an actual Fallout game lol
---
Yay!!! Found a vendor that had it! Thank you Jadedear! &lt;3
---
Great, thanks so much!
---
Awwww.... Someone is salty as fuck...........
---
Cute....
---
Hopefully you get a friend for Christmas, nobody.
---
Good thing everything in my vending machine is priced between 0 and 1 cap already. I only markup legendaries when I have any I don't automatically scrip. I have had to empty my vendor of those to make space for my primary gear though. I'm running around with disposable items now. I also created a video that looks at every high end item in my stash. Least that way I can remember the details should they go missing.
---
Merry Christmas and may the Santa robot bring you tons of scortched holiday gifts.
---
Get the dense mod on your chest piece and/or Max out the fireproof perk. Then you are basically immune to all explosions and the scortchbeast screams
---
The Action Hero. 
---
I really doubt they'll re-skin that item. Look at their response to the uproar over the riot coat change, and that is a paid item.
---
Actually yes, they do. Peoples accounts get hacked and stolen all the time. It's why I left WoW for almost 6 months a few years ago (ceased played entirely a year-ish ago)
---
We must run in different circles
---
I rename my main three weapons and make sure that they start with a . so they are at the top of my list alphabetically. Same for my armor pieces &amp; power armor. 
---
0. for Power Armor
---
1. for Chest Piece
---
2. for Arms
---
3. for Legs
---
4. for Underarmor like Military Fatigues (Cha +2) and Forest Op (Str +3)
---
5. for Gas/Protective Masks
---
6. for commonly used outfits for Atom Challenges.
---
Agreed.
---
I always missiles and grenades.  Last night I broke down and sold my plasma cores for cheap.  I think I’m going to keep some cheap meta ammo for my vending machine, my main weapon ammo and drop all the random ammo I don’t need.  It seems only a few types of ammo sell consistently.  A few occasionally sell out to a random customer, the rest just sits there.
---
Hehe thanks
---
The weeds were on point with my imagination last night. Lol. Thanks.
---
Saw a guy who made a post with a screenshot from fallout 4 pickpocket inventory, title was "Now we know what they feel" x)
---
LOL tossing shit for ps4...
---
Dude plays BL3 on PS4.
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
FOH...
---
Server side validation paved the way for functions to be completely ran server side rather than client side. This is why blizzard/wow doesn't have problems with hackers or duping anymore. Bethesda either cheaped out or got a team with lack of modern multiplayer development experience.
---
Agree with this completely. The number of things left out of the patch notes with every update honestly makes me wonder if files and code from the other studios during development were missing details leading to endless bugs with no clue what or why something changed. The continual reintroduction of bugs makes me think the different builds are not isolated correctly. Bugs are being patched on old code, then patched into new code, overwriting the previous fixes.
---
I can dig it. That way you're not rummaging through everything in your inventory.
---
Has it crossed your mind that people that *do* play are also capable of criticizing the game and Bethesda when they deserve it?
---
Today and tomorrow were targeted days. I have no idea if yesterday's patch has anything to do with those threats, or was just for the previous hack. I'm still on the sidelines.
---
I keep a scrap limit.  Every few days, i bulk any scrap over that limit and sell it.
---
On PS4, friend and I after heavily farming an area to like 3k weight worth of guns and items, found our games to stutter very badly, and was resolved upon scrapping and selling all of it... 
---
So I'd have to say yes, an overloaded inventory seems to stress things a bit... But it could just be anecdotal....
---
Every one of those games had terrible netcode, as such none of them are really a great example of competent development.
---
Two of the three were so poorly mismanaged that it led to the sunsetting of the games themselves and the third is just going through the motions while they milk the playerbase on microtransactions.

They probably wouldn't lose much. The solution you're proposing is different than the one the OP suggested. They suggested shutting done all PC servers entirely until it was fixed. Warned about  it doesn't do much until someone actually does it and they can see specifically how it's done in their logs. How are you supposed to do that on servers that are not up. If they knew what the issue actually was it wouldn't have been an exploit to begin with. Yeah, it sucks but they're in open war with these hacker assholes and in war there are always going to be civilian casualties. The enemy was crafty with this one dropped a big bomb on the civilian population while support troops we're away on leave with their families to maximize the damage and limit the response. 
---
When it comes to giving free private servers to the PC community it would have been a nice gesture but they can't win when it comes to the player base (at least not the ones here on Reddit) if they had done that all the bipolar rage- babies would have just been triggered all over again. You would have the inconsiderate PC 1st subscribers crying "why do these other PC players get private servers for free just because Bethesda 'can't do their job!'" and they would be demanding something for free. Then you would have all the console cry babies complaining about PC players getting preferential treatment with free private servers 'waaah! They have! I want too! Waahh!' I'm not saying everyone would behave this way but from what I've seen on Reddit in the few short months I've been here the ones who are this type are extremely vocal and good at making themselves look like the majority. 
---
This whole situation sucks and it was going to be a lose-lose for the PC player base and for Bethesda from the moment it was mentioned. 
---
I want to go on record tjat I am a PC player so I actually have some skin in this fight (not an Xbox 'boi' like the OP. ugh 'boi' one of the few words that rivals 'bae' in it's lame factor) Im also a 1st subscriber (which is probably what saved me from this debacle because luckily I've been in my private server since the Christmas event started)  That being said I personally would have been okay with the solution you suggested and as far as recompense goes I'm okay with whatever Bethesda does. They could give those affected a free year of 1st and restore everything they lost and i wouldn't be upset. When it comes down to it you and I both are just being armchair quarterbacks in this situation with no real knowledge of what's going on other than what we see here on Reddit.  Have a Merry Xmas (if that's your thing) and thank you for being civil during this conversation considering I have an unpopular position on the topic.
---
World of Warcraft is a massive example. It has had accounts hacked and stolen/looted, also has had some major past issues with hackers too. (that game is 15 years old now, and people can still pull that off)

😂😂😂😂 you drank the drink of drunks
---
I also wouldn't blame you if I got to tl:dr on that post, it was long AF. PEACE

It is a nasty bit of schadenfreude, but it \*is\* oddly satisfying to watch old employers fail because they persist in the very habits you complained about whilst employed by them.

The helmet that only affected 50 people? That one? Lol. The one that was not part of the power armor edition?
---
You really need to move on if you are complaining about licensing issues a year ago. Did any of these affect you personally?
---
You're a fucking fallout 76 player dude, you're in no position to judge any other game you clown lmao
---
You are a thief of joy.
---
If you are over lvl 45 you can go kill super mutants at the west tek company
---
Usually threats like this are unfounded. The fact they fixed as quickly as they did is a good thing, they probably were investigating beforehand seeing as it was patched within 12 hours of release. Pretty quick turnaround considering. The bad actors are to blame here. It’s odd you don’t blame the hackers at all who are ruining the game.
---
Thing is wouldn’t duping keep prices down? If the AAE +agility Handmade hadn’t been masses duped on xbox it’d be a much rarer weapon so worth more caps. 
---
People blame high prices on dupers but if it weren’t for them weapons and armour would be worth a lot more.
---
Uh... no. That'd just invite a whole slew of hackers even more so.
---
It is NOT the only way "to get the public back on their side". That's the way YOU seem to want it done. What seems the be the most ACTUAL resounding way people want is for Bethesda to basically "pause" the game and take however much time they need to seal it up as much as possible to avoid this in the future.
---
It saves so much time.
---
Still waiting on my refund you tightwad bastards
---
I'd say yes. When I started a couple new characters, I noticed that quickly crafting items (like food) had considerably little lag. Now that I've accumulated a healthy collection, it's back to blogging down a bit.
---
The Voice of Todd has spoken!
---
I would add that the first and ultimate boss of the current game, the scorch beast queen, will still bug out and fly off the map one year later in the games life is very telling of the amount of effort being put into the games longevity.
---
Mine stutters all the time and I've just recently learned it is the graphics settings. Basically they are too high on ultra for almost any PC.  There is a post in reddit about optimizing the settings. Mine are much better after but I still need to dial down some to completely fix the issue.
---
Once it’s safe to play on PC I’ll let you know and you can buy what you want x
---
You do realize that there are online games over 10 years old that STILL have problems with hackers/glitches/bugs, right?
---
&gt;The canvas bag should have shipped the way they advertised it.
---
And they ended up paying double the cost for failing to do so.
---
&gt;Same with the nuka rum. 
---
No one has provided any source nor have I found any source that shows they lied or mislead anyone about Nuka Rum.
---
&gt;In a way, yes - but not on that level. It all just has a manipulative tone to it and i dont like that.
---
So you are not familiar with how shitty a launch WoW had?  Destiny, Rust, Ark. Shit even Fortnite sat in "beta" mode for years on steam while they were fully monetizing the game to excuse all the issues and patches to fix the game.
---
And beyond that it is the face/PR department's job to eat a shit sandwich and make it sound like it isn't that bad.  No company ever does anything different.
---
If you're crouched when you reload it does not affect the primary effect.
---
Is it really that hard to build a level 3 lock to deter the casual gift thief? I mean they'll go wanted if they do and I don't think anyone wants that kind of BS in their life especially when gifts/holiday scorched are so relatively common in the wasteland right now.
---
Bulk, Bulk, Bulk....Need plastic?  Golf course has tons, golf balls, shopping baskets, toys...Westec has tons, scrap all those laser rifles with the Scarpper card and get 100 plus plastic in one run
---
Did your mother smoke crack while she was pregnant with you?
---
What's the risk in logging in lately? I've been vaguely following the news that some hackers can now remotely steal shit from inventories from 200m away or something. I def have some legacy items I don't want to lose, so until this is secure I'm not even logging in.
---
If the game is "ass"... why keep posting about it and move onto something that isn't "ass"? 🤔
---
I don't mind that stuff so much as long as it is not ALL there is. One of the very first of the few Atomic Shop offerings was a pretty pink princess castle bed. Meanwhile, players are STILL asking for certain faction cosmetics to be introduced to the game. Imo it reeks of asset flips.
---
Wait.... The "winter clothes" that u have to grind 14000xp is a f+king beanie?
---
Keep the faith my dude. All will be well. Things will always be dicey, that's the lot we've accepted as residents of Vault 76. :) I'll be around if you need someone to pal around with.
---
This was the case in the early days of duping, you could get TSE weapons for 5k caps back then! That was before the nerf when they were op!
---
God damn...
---
Yea its way more than 3
---
I didn't try but since the perk for reduce the time didnt seem to affect flux , i bet fridge won't too.
---
WHOOOOOOOSHHHHHHH
---
You need to find a better argument than "licensing issues from over a year ago" they still ordered the bags so they knew what the product would look like, therefore advertising anything else than what you have is lying. 
---
The helmet thing was a mistake on my part, i admit. But wtf? The one that affected only 50 people? Still 50 too many if you ask me, but thats another topic
---
I love seeing peoples creativity. Whether it's the CAMPS or the roleplaying, I love it.
---
See "Bethesda (Kinda) Apologizes" elsewhere on this Reddit...
---
I was obviously joking. Did yours?
---
Wait, what? Did I miss stat boosters in the Atom Shop?
---
The fact that people are taking what I say seriously is crazy to me. It’s like people on this site don’t understand satire. I am aware of the small player base and obviously no game had billions of players lol. Holy shit haha
---
Keep the faith Vault Dweller. :) If you need help getting things back hit me up if you log back in.
---
Damn, your little 10 IQ brain must of ran out of things to say
---
The nickname of the MG 42 is Hitler's Buzzsaw.
---
I hope i dont get banned for this lol
---
If the hackers don't fear getting banned, I'm not sure why they'd go on a campaign of trying to ban others for illegal gear.
---
That's nice. Until they return the stuff stolen from the over 500 users who got screwed by this. The issue is NOT resolved. 
---
And given the open mess that the engine is and how they half assed turning it into an online multiplayer engine, something this bad will happen again unless Bethesda actually spends some money to implement real security.
---

---
My answer? Knives. All knives. Any level of health, any knife. There are also enough cards for a quick swap to heavy weapons as necessary
---
Never worked for Bethesda and never EVER will. There parent company Zenimax are dicks.
---
Merry Christmas fellow vault dweller. Have a great 2020!
---
&gt;this game was a money grab
---
Uh... you literally don't need to spend IRL money on anything once you buy the actual game so... what?
---
Apparently you don't even play the game, so I'm not surprised you seem to not actually know how the game works, but do us all a favor and next time, at least look up how a game works before you spout regurgitated nonsense.
---
How do you transport that amount of weight somewhere to scrap? That seems insane.
---
Don't think they will be able to comment until they have more info. It was only patched yesterday. That's no where near enough time to be able to confirm anything for sure. They need time to sort out support tickets and monitor the situation to see if more adjustment is needed
---
Only my 2 main weapons on my 2 characters.... BE Handmade is The Bitch....TSE Primed 50 cal, Queen Killer...Merry Xmas!!
---
Absolutely. That has zero bearing on my comment however.
---
I've said many times that I blame both: the incompetent Bethesda, and the people who took advantage of that incompetence.
---
Look, I get it. You are one of the biggest Bethesda ~~shills~~ defenders on this sub, and for some weird reason you feel like it's your duty to make excuses for them and praise them even when they have been jumping from controversy to controversy since launch. That's just your pusillanimous nature, and I accept that - even if I disagree with it.
---
It's a server side patch afaik so the client wouldn't need to be updated. It's been live since yesterday for pc players.
---
i've made 2 posts about it. Hope you are enjoying your ass game though with a company that doesn't give a fuck about you.
---
Keep the faith fellow Vault Dweller. :)
---
Did I say it was resolved or did I say it was patched?
---
Reading comprehension is a thing.
---
What a nice idea! Merry Christmas to you too!
---
If you dont like the game, then dont play it/join the reddit? LOL
---
there are online games over 10 years old that have had issues like this (and still do), yet they still go on. grow up Kaiser.
---
Thank you
---
Best be careful there mister. We might come up and "annex" you boys fallout style.
---
Then why are you on the reddit? Also, not really. WoW has hacker issues still (and bugs, glitches, etc). A few other games I know of (online) ALSO have the SAME issues. People just tend to be a lil more afraid to hack WoW because Blizzard will take you to COURT over it (something Bethesda needs to start doing).
---
I'm not sure what your issue could be. Following my methods we had 8 man groups farming it on our stream for hours.
---
Sounds like this is a thing. It doesn't happen when I have half of the workshops. I get this is a thing on public servers, but why is this a thing on private servers? I can't use my Fallout 1st membership to the full extent this way. I will submit a ticket.
---
How many exploits stayed fixed the first time they were patched?
---
Also worth mentioning: Regarding the engine, parent company Zenimax actually spent a considerable amount of effort and veteran resources to rewrite parts of the creation engine to work properly for 76’s online architecture. They mention this in the vidoc produced about 76. Fallout 4 rendered the world completely different since it was single player, so it was probably a large undertaking and a point where BGS lacked sufficient experience for their dev timeline on the game. 
---
But zenimax definitely has some veteran and extremely experienced people when it comes to online architecture for MMO’s, and they helped a lot with 76 it seems like. The studio was built as a triple A mmorpg production studio. If it’s a management problem, I would suspect it to be on BGS side, and not Zenimax’s.
---
I put two and two together man you're good 🤣
---
Yeah. It's not your system. Can you play fallout 4 or doom or similar on it without issue?
---
Cause I'm going to say the most likely cause is the broken game
---
How is there not a test server by now? How? Todd himself even said in an interview that they wished they had done that first. It is hard to comprehend why they are doing the things they are doing.
---
A Merry Knishmas to you too!
---
And the hackers win.  This is exactly why this hack was created.  To destroy the remaining playerbase because we are seen as the enemy to those who want to inflict pain on Bethesda.  That's why people are cheering... they hate Fo76 and want it to die but players that enjoy it for what it is are keeping that from happening so they are messing with us now.
---
I'm sure in your mind it doesn't.
---
I was just about to ask about it. When i was modding my ultracite PA i saw ‘Responder skin’ as an option but it says ‘unlock in atom shop’, yet no such item in atom shop to be found. I thought I missed it.
---
You would be surprised, before I went to private server only because of the hack I had 4 players in one day lock pick my collector. Of course all 5 died due to my bloodied handmade shortly after that....
---
How do you know what value a service is to another person?
---
Merry Christmas. See you in the Wasteland.
---
Bright side my new camp is better than my old camp and I farmed gifts while doing it. Still sucks had to rebuild everything and was up all night doing it.
---
I think it's broken again, although, I did notice my quad lever action is working fine like you mentioned
---
So let me understand, It should be:
---
Clinent: Fires gun at man
---
Server: Fires gun at man and checks that it can be done using game's own logic
---
Instead of:
---
Server: Well I'll just take your word for it I guess
---
And this was completely preventable if Bethesda made the server side checked to make sure what was happening followed the game's own logic; ie guns can only be made this way (crafting, looted ect) and if they originate some other way they are invalid.
---
Am I understanding correctly?
---
Marry Christmas
---
There's reports of two players doing this; one picks the locks and grinches the gifts, the other then kills them when they go wanted. Split the profits.
---
A "private" server is just a regular server with a flag that limits joining to you and people on your friends list. If their code is insecure enough that people are able to steal entire inventories, I wouldn't be surprised if they can bypass that check.
---
My post was specifically about the people who don't play this game but continually comment on it. That is it. If you want to expand the scope that is entirely on you.
---
If i were to not use junkies or bloodied. Id probably go with furious for auto weapons. If your good at aiming and hitting consecutive shots, its about the next best thing. Everyone on here praises Anti-Armor, but its honestly not all that great. With the way bethesdas armor penetration algorithm works, you only gain a maximum damage increase of 28.5%. No matter how armored or unarmored your target is. 28.5% is barely better then 2shot which is at 25% if both bullets hit. Furious stacks up 40% and is by far a better choice, especially if you use vats with the concentrated fire perk card. Only downside of furious is only being able to engage 1 target at a time, so fighting mobs can be tricky if your not an accurate shot or usuing vats.
---
Merry Christmas to all Vault dwellers. May Santatron bring you gifts instead of coal.
---
*they took our isometreeeeee*
---
Merry Christmas 🎄
---
I've read your post history. We both know what you meant, brother.
---
Must we?
---
Then why are you still stalking news about the game like a creepy Ex? 
---
Aight, anyway... There are quite a few online games that suffer issues from bugs, glitches, hackers, etc (even more than FO76). Look at World of Warcraft for example, and that game is 15 YEARS OLD and I've seen WAY worse crap over there, than I've ever seen in FO76 yet, to the point where servers would go down for over a WEEK every so often.
---
Do you seriously think this sort of stuff doesn't happen? There will ALWAYS be hackers. The trick is to find out who they are and take them to court. Get them Prison Time to show them that this isn't a "haha, funny" joke.
---
This is NOT a failed game. This is NOT a failed concept. If you don't like it and want to regurgitate what other NON PLAYERS are spewing out about on YT, then don't play it/stalk news about it. That simple.
---
I agree with Comiconomist, you're potentially doing a huge disservice to the programmers by blaming them. Imagine reading something like this the day before Christmas, where an ignorant playerbase heaps all the fault for recent issues on your shoulders, and it might not even be your bad. Maybe it was managerial or maybe it was the big wigs at the very top cutting corners... who knows?
---
We could just stop using the blame game because we really don't know what the actual problems are. Ruling out something like the engine is fine when you have the technical experience, but saying "it's these guys!" isn't exactly helpful.
---
3 cheers for more years!!! Merry Christmas and Happy new year!
---
Stay positive fellow Vault Dweller! :)
---
Hmm... a surprising amount to unwrap in your deceptively-simple two-sentence reply. You feel the need to defend the "two posts about it", yet continue to call it an "ass game", showing you DO have feelings about it still. You try to separate yourself from the game (by referring to it as "YOUR (emphasis added for clarity) ass game"), but just can't give it up. And finally, your true anger is (rightly) directed at Bethesda, and not me...
---
Merry Christmas! and here's to a new decade!
---
Ahhh. Hey,  that's how language develops.
---
Considering where we started from a year ago, I think that Bethesda has done a good job in adding functionality and content.  And I'm also good with them trying to monetize other stuff even if it goes against their initial promises (e.g. sure I'm willing to pay for substantial DLC's, okay with them charging for Atom Shop stuff etc.).
---
The 2 big cons are obviously the hacking/duping and bug-fix/balancing responsiveness.  I'm willing to live with &amp; understand the former because there are always going to be asshats (admittedly, really smart asshats) and I assume Bethesda can make me whole.  The latter is more of a conundrum.   Bugs don't annoy me because its a fact of life.  The responsiveness to fixing bugs/balancing and the QA is lacking.
---
But yes.  Overall, I am optimistic with FO76 and think there are plenty of opportunities for new and interesting content.  They should hire additional # developers and # QA testers and find creative ways to monetize.
---
And this is why I have took a break from the game ever since the halloween event. I had a feeling something like this was going to happen.
---
You don't blame the hackers for hacking? LOL okay then?
---
I personally hope that EVERY LAST HACKER gets Prison Time. After all, it's illegal.
---
I had a big smarmy response typed, but it basically boils down to:
---
Refunds? Maybe you should read terms, conditions and user agreements. Being to ignorant to read such things should not be an excuse to back out of things you agreed to because you don't like the terms. 
---
And duping is a reality in online games. It was inevitable. Thinking.BGS could have prevented it entirely from the start is an absolute joke. 
---
The non cosmetic items? They're borderline useless. 
---
The real problem with this hacking issue?
---
PC trash. This entire inventory hack is due to dick PC players. When someone buys a gun and shoots someone you don't go arrest Smith and Wesson. When someone drives drunk and hits a pedestrian with their car you don't go arrest Toyota. 
---
Also. Kind of hilarious that users of a platform with third party mods available somehow seem surprised that cheating and hacking is a thing.
---
I can't wait until BGS kills all third party mods in game as a way to help prevent cheating and hacking only to have the PC 76 community go on the rampage.
---
I had something close to that and just got more mounted deer heads!  But I made 4 large ones, and got 2 icicle light plans. I can't get the plasma grenade or crash Santa though.
---
Merry Christmas you filthy animal.
---
*Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang*
---
And a happy new year
---
I’m addicted to the feeling I get when I find a great piece of legendary gear either as a drop or for cheap at a player vendor. For me, it’s all about the grind for better gear. 
---
Also, even though the story is a little thin in 76 imho, I’m a huge fangirl of the series as a whole. To the point where the only gifts my husband gets me anymore is Fallout swag.
---
Every single online software ever created has the possibility of being hacked, Windows to Wow has been hacked also. Major financial institutions have been hacked.
---
Hell Equifax was hacked.
---
And people expect a game maker to be rock solid and totally immune to hack?
---
Sounds like they are not living in the reality of an online world.
---
Agreed, Jonr95
---
I'm not sure why you feel the need to defend a game that isn't good. It's okay to enjoy things that are bad but you do it with such fervor that it sounds like buyers remorse
---
Wastelanders is the make or break for this game moving forward, I doubt they will stick with it further if the game continues to be mediocre.
---
Right, it’s entirely PC players faults, and not the fact that Bethesda didn’t code their servers to not blindly accept EVERYTHING the client sends it. Do a little digging. The server will accept ANYTHING
---
Merry Christmas, Resident!
---
Is there somewhere that lists all the (hidden) category bonuses?
---
Sure it is. 
---
Renting a private server without the additional perks, for just about any other game runs the same price. It's pretty standard optional stuff here.
---
Welcome to online gaming
---
Bethesda saw this suggestion and gave you a private server subscription.
---
They've figured out ways to cheaply circumvent hwid bans already. It's still worth doing but just as one of many things that need to be done to stop them.
---
Merry Christmas mate. Can't wait for wastelanders
---
One possible glint of hope when it comes reaches end of life is they release the ability to host it on your own hardware. At least for PC this would open a lot of possibilities.
---
No idea if they'd do that. But the faintest possibility is there.
---
This sub is two factions. The shills who downvote anything bad about Bethesda and the critics who downvote anything good about Bethesda. It's like US politics but in a video game subreddit.
---
Literally half the ghouls we can talk to are pre war. The majority of ghouls in Fallout 1 are. Also Mr. House isn't even a ghoul and he survived the war.
---
The best part of this video is the footage with the original lighting.
---
I come here to monitor the game status. WoW does not have anywhere near as many bugs let alone glitches and game breaks as Fallout 76 does. What are these other games you speak of? Also, these aren't "hacks" into Fallout 76; Client side edits are perfectly legal, that's not even hacking. No encryption or server security was bypassed or cracked. It's up to the server to secure things tied to money. In fact it's negligence if they don't. Legally it's all on Bethesda.
---
Perhaps we will get a seasonal recipe: santa souflee
---
If you paid real money for ingame items such as weapons and gear to make the game easier for you (which i do believe you can get in trouble for btw), then I have very little sympathy and hope Bethesda does NOT give those items back.
---
If you meant Atom Shop stuff, then you can simple re-craft it, so that's an easy fix for that.
---
Bethesda..... They made a whole post about it man
---
Seems like someone should figure out a way to set the language to Russian without it actually doing so.
---
MAC addresses are easily changed or spoofed.
---
Sad, sad naive people. 
---
I sure hope you buy zero games from any major studio... 
---
Secret time? They're all owned by greedy corporations who are out to take your money and are all complicit in the shoddy state of the gaming industry.
---
Maybe if they opened it up to modders like every other thriving Fallout game...
---
As a person who's been a bit cynical since I was a kid, it can be hard to direct level-headed criticism toward a company and still be productive, positive, and helpful. The frustration builds up and it feels unfair when there are so many problems, and we have so little control over them. And it becomes especially hard to maintain etiquette-- both toward the company and other players-- when we're living with personal hardships, as many of us are.  
---
So to all the people I've sassed and argued with about this game, I hope your hardships are a little bit lighter this week, and that you have a great time playing whatever makes you happy.
---
I love the franchise.  Playing since the original took my whole hdd back in,  96 was it? 
---
Didn't enjoy FO3 or NV much,  but our whole family played FO4.  Wife,  me,  daughter. 
---
Id 76 stays online,  we'll play. If not,  I'd play a single player standalone.
---
I have a lot of hours in fallout 4, most of which are perfecting boobie mods.  I generally enjoy fallout 76 more than fallout 4, most of my time spent perfecting my camp, and longing for boobie mods.
---
I've played since Beta (that ol' excuse), and today's game is a far different thing from those early days. Is the game great? Hardly, but the very bugs themselves give us (my playing buddies and myself) something to commiserate each other with (You'll often hear cries of "Dammit Todd!" in our Discord). 
---
TLDR? Game is still fun for us. If we were solo players? Maybe not so much. And I'll defend that fun.
---
&gt; It has had accounts hacked and stolen/looted
---
I asked specifically about cheats, not people breaking into users' accounts. That's completely different.
---
In regards to the cheats in WoW, the worst I can find mention of is the cheat that lasted barely any time at all, allowing somebody to kill NPC, players, anything with just a click, and presumably a key press.
---
That's bad, but it's *leagues* less bad than the two big recent ones with Fallout 76. The inventory *modification*, and spawning of arbitrary assets, you know?
---
I usually like to be a jack of all trades, but the inventory in this game forced me to figure out which perks/equipment I favored and to have a specific character build govern the inventory needed.  It made it easier to know what to scrap/sell, and I didn't have to sink as many points into weight reduction perks.
---
Great post! I love this community! Merry Christmas! Cheers
---
Actually, you don't need to spend money on the game after buying the game itself... so...
---
Merry Christmas, just got an early Christmas present, 400 purified water and a daisy cutter (fat man from a retiring player along with some ledgandarys, I will honour the player by using them in my battle to iradicate giant bats. Merry Christmas to all vault dwellers.
---
This should give you comfort:, The silent majority love this game, spend hours playing it with friends and family or maybe alone.  The noisy folks who are angry have a right to be angry so long as they don’t ruin it for everyone else.
---
Again, take comfort.  The silent majority agree with you.
---
Have a Holly Jolly Christmas!
---
INT has many good cards, Nerd Rage, Demo Expert, Gunsmith (less repair), Stabilized (Power armor), etc. High INT also earns you more XP I believe.
---
So stock up on syringer and musket ball ammo. It’s gonna be the hot seller of the season.

Booo, what did I miss?
---
Well, thats an entirely different discussion, but im with you.
---
My kids are my life. I had a relative watch them one day, and i honestly didnt know what to do with myself. Im so used to having them here to take care of. Lol.
---
Merry Christmas, sadly I'm on Xbox yet I shall do the same in regular power armour
---
Ooh. Smart.
---
There's also the normal non crazy people in between that really wish the other two types would fall in a ditch full of crocodiles.
---
Too much Nukashine in your egg nog.
---
No worries. Happens all the time to me. Worst is when I hop on to launch and they haven’t been cracked yet for the week.
---
Client side programmers given the task of turning this project around on that time frame with this feature set aren't "low quality" programmers, they're victims of incompetent management. 
---
Any competent group of programmers, if they had been given the choice, would most likely say this project should not be undertaken, and if it were to be, it would require more time, more resources, and certainly more testing.
---
Exactly like US politics lol
---
Yeah I'm kinda surprised that the m1911 isn't already a thing honestly. Its just as iconic as a tommy gun
---
lol okay whatever yoy say to justify your terrible purchase. Well I did what the other smart people did and got our refunds and have been happily watch this shitfest of a game crash and burn for the last year and a half.
---
Good luck at least there are some people like you that find garbage games fun because you are the only people that give Bethesda justification on rolling out subpar AAA titles!
---
From me and mine to you and yours. Merry Christmas and Happy Hunting.
---
Heads up though, unplugged vending machines still work. You have to blueprint and store them to  stop people from buying anything.
---
Vintage Nukashine !!!!!!
---
There is also a MAJOR issue of people duplicating items and currency. Both in the past AND currently. It's seriously been happening for over 6 years.
---
Yeah.  I remember changing RAM and windows threw a fit.  I wanna say that was back on XP?  It was a long time ago. But I fixed it in a couple minutes online.
---
Just because we disagree does not mean I hate you. 
---
Happy holidays.
---
I've done that too. Just standing there at the launch terminal like......guess I'm done here. Lol
---
The thing is, and I hope you can understand my view as an outsider when you read this, your 'information' is unconfirmed and thus it is, fundamentally and unfortunately, a rumour. And rumours aren't allowed.
---
So even though you may be 100% well-intentioned, when you tell me that there's a hack in the works that lets people buy from my vendor for 1 cap per item, what you're doing is spreading an unsubstantiated rumour. People may run around unplugging their vendors like you are, potentially losing out on thousands of caps in sales. That is damage done if the hack isn't real or at least is never completed.
---
So basically, if you're actually trying to help, I applaud you. But if you can't bring some evidence of the thing you're talking about, how can anyone trust you? It would be very easy for trolls to go around 'warning' people of problems when those problems don't actually exist, and then players lose out scrambling to try to avoid the non-existent hack.
---
So to clarify, I don't think ill of you... I just have no reason to trust your claims. If it cost me nothing to listen and be prepared, then I would thank you anyway; but when your warning comes with an advised practice that somehow devalues the gameplay for me, I'm going to be suspicious. I think that's just rational.
---
People have been reporting lost items for months. Still no word from Bethesda though.
---
It might be hackers/exploiters who downvote, for your post to be seen by less people.
---
While something would be nice, I know nothing will happen, as all they care about is $$$. This was made quite obvious when they released Fallout 1st on the anniversary. \*rolls eyes\*. 
---
When I want to have fun building and decorating I go back to FO4, which I personally love. I had a lot of people play FO76 early on, but very few remain. I do not play very much except to check the weekly quests and pop on once a day to see the daily ones, and do any that are not overly difficult. 
---
I wish the FO 1st was customizable, then I would consider buying into it. I personally do not care about the outifts or power armour, tent (as I have my home in a great spot that allows for inexpensive traveling across the world), or scrapbox (still do not understand how people run out of space). I would love the option to increase C.A.M.P area, have a member only store that is always stocked with every recipe, and the option to have a pet (even if only available while on private servers).
---
Someone will hack a 3 star god gun of DOOM then bring it online to murder everyone.
---
"The greatest gift anyone could give you as a gamer this Christmas is a thank you"
---
Nope I could use some cash chief. That would be the greatest gift.
---
Vault 94
---
I loved it. Merry christmas ♥
---
PC .. definitely have had an item or two disappear from my stash. Few bad ass armor pieces.. no weapons though. Not even sure what they would have been so can't report it.
---
I didn’t know about the extra exp either, thanks!
---
Merry Christmas to all the hackers too, who made this festivities even more fun!
---
To all my fellow watelanders, have a Merry Christmas, a Happy Hanukkah, a Joyous Kwanzaa, or a great whatever holiday you celebrate.
---
The community.
---
Had a major frame rate problem.
---
Updated graphic drivers ...  problem gone.
---
Basically, try reinstalling drivers
---
Imagine how big the Unofficial Patch for 76 would be at this point
---
I can provide a link to the forums they use.  This contributes to more access to their evil.  This is not a place to disseminate such information.   I do understand your point.  Completely valid.  Feel free to search for it.  It’s no service or benefit to me wether you believe the comments I make or not.  If the post burns in a negative review hole, fine.  I simply try.
---
Like, really fixed? Or some palliative BS only to close our mouths?
---
Well the air is hot humid where I live good sir
---
Well, i should not log in then, im wearing last year's elf costume. :D
---
Lets just get this out of the way: WoW? Let this game age 15 years and then we can come back. Destiny did mess up but have since redeemed themselves. The rest? Never played em. Also its about this game not any other. Why are people so lenient? They released an unfinished game with the intention of fixing it as time goes (i know, by far not the only game) but it was barely playable at best when it released. They doubled down on the promise that in game purchases were cosmetic only and proceeded to piss on said promise by launching fallout first (which ironically also didnt work as promised)
---
Lastly: PR is not the same as the face of a company. Pr works to make the company seem as customer friendly and good as possible. Todd howard is a game director who just reveales the game. The game has potential and i hope it gets the chance to become something amazing. But until that happens lets not just say the redeemed themselves
---
There are tons of warnings up on facebook, in twitter comments, on reddit, and everywhere else you see things regarding this game. Everyone had tons of warning. 
---
And You have no right to place the blame on Bethesda either, because it's not their fault that some douchebags searched for a hack just to ruin people's gameplay and holidays. So stop placing blame on the people that don't deserve it, because news flash: you can't change the mistake you are
---
Well we’re not really proving them wrong because Bethesda really isn’t supporting the game properly but still, I love this post. It reminds me to try to stay positive. I certainly have a bad day in 76 sometimes and decide to bitch about it when I should just move on. Merry Christmas wastelander!
---
Is it bad if I got them fired from there too?
---
Lol, it's a guy that made a hack to trade raid armor with his friends. He released it and said he's not responsible for what other players do with it. It's literally all their cheat forum is talking about.
---
Lost sentinel and cavalier bolstering armor pieces. Crazy.
---
That's a lil' bit much, yeah?
---
I called my railway "Pin 'em Up", and my handmade "Knock 'em Down"
---
Mister Ed was a show about a horse eating peanut butter!!
---
Merry Christmas to you as well! See you in the wasteland.
---
They've already rotated through those V94 frames at least once prior to this, so I'm sure they'll bring them back again at some point.
---
There's a ton of random encounters that most players will have never found. The unique vendors that you could recruit to your settlements, for example.
---
Glad you enjoyed!
---
This is kind of impressive. Lol. The rad ants part is holding me and everyone else in my squad back. Bout to just start running it on novice back to back to het them all. Its ridiculous
---
It's not. Not even close. 
---
If it was the game would have had staying power. It didn't. The sub died. The hype died. It's off most people's radar.
---
Entire game took less than 30 hours, including all but 6 side quests. Combat is repetitive and shallow. 
---
The loot pool even more so, less than 15 total weapons in the game, all are unoriginal and features a modding system that has a whopping like 12 actual mods with static stat boosts....
---
The and pool is bloated with dozens of items that all share less than 10 status effects...
---
The game launched buggy. Including a bug that when you finished the game, you didn't get some of your companions prologue entries...because they were dead? Even though they weren't .... Even in game difficulties where companion death is impossible....
---
Or the bug that stops you from completing the game at all...
---
The writing is meh at best, and uses one liners in dialogue far too often to try to be funny. The actual dialogue? They hold your hand through checks to ensure you always get the result you want with no risk of failure.
---
The actual story is mediocre and predictable. They give away everything in the first five minutes and you play through already knowing who's good, who's bad, who you can trust, who you can't and every NPC is exactly what they seem. There's no questioning of motives. No unexpected actions by NPCs.
---
Exploration is non existent and unsatisfying. The places you explore outside the main areas are repetitive and just not interesting. 5 rundown buildings. Some boxes. Some bad guys. Rinse. Repeat.
---
Character builds and build depth are borderline useless. 
---
The game was disappointing. It wasn't bad. It's just pretty good. It relies too heavily on Easter eggs and references. It also almost entirely rips off Firefly and yet somehow makes firefly less interesting. 
---
Ohhhh and don't forget the recycled quests. One of the first big quests you embark on, with a big moral choice! Is almost directly lifted from two quests you've already seen in Fallout games....
---
Merry Christmas, nice positive post!
---
You do not need everything in your aid tab. Keep the basics and dump/sell the rest and live off the land. There’s plenty of food and drink out there you don’t need to hoard water or fancy lads.
---
Have a Merry Merry Christmas fellow vault dweller!!! And of course, a blessed and splendid 2020!!
---
I suppose so, I would like more transparency like we were led to believe we were gonna get as well.
---
Okay that’s fair.
---
Blast mines are sort of weird, they need inert bombs to craft, their detonation is sort of like a plume of flame. ive barely had much time to play around with them, but they look cool
---
I actually heard that too.  A youtuber was sayin that it was supposed to happen on Christmas eve.  There was also supposed to be a new category which would cost I think 75 script and you get a random 3 star.
---
I remember when we were converting from 10 to 10/100 NICs and I bought 50 3com cards.  9 of them had the same MAC.  Ugly situation that I will never forget.
---
I don't blame you for trying either, and just to clarify, I didn't downvote your post. I just wanted to explain why some folks might do so, and why it's hard to trust help these days. :P
---
Merry Christmas fellow Dweller. Country roads take you home.
---
Idk about Xbox, but i dont think so. At least not on PC.
---
I found that most of the game (other than maybe the 3-4 "end game" events that are much harder than the rest) can be played fine with a simple non-legendary automatic rifle (handmade or even combat). Although I seem to have really bad luck with that weapon class, almost never get anything useful from the purveyor, while I do have a few somewhat decent heavy guns for my other character where the legendary effects are at least better than nothing.
---
The atoms
---
Weellllll, we may have to wait and see.
---
The last rumour ended up being true, so I appreciated he heads up.
---
Dead bodies im private servers? Do tell!
---
Merry Christmas wasteland! May mama Murmrgh be kind to you!
---
This made me shed a tear.
---
The gaming space will never get better as long as consumers/players keep supporting half assed titles.
---
“Let’s release a broken product, they’ll play until we fix it.”
---
And what are you guys doing? 
---
This is not an opinion post, it’s a fact.
---
This thread was mainly to get the few who aren’t addicted to this product and actually value their time to wake up. The rest of you are a lost cause.
---
You’re about a day too late. Players on pc were helping people reduce weight and clean their inventories left and right
---
Merry Christmas hope you have a fantastic day in Appalachia
---
Absolutely this. Make an example out of a few, make them pay for the rest of their lives. Establish a precedence and future wannabes will think twice before stealing.
---
I'll weird.  I play alone 100% of the time. But I prefer it on open wasteland. Maybe I just like ignoring everyone?
---
Merry Christmas!! Happy 2020 vault dwellers
---
My railway is the "Chattanooga Choo Choo"
---
Only just started playing after being put off by reviews when first came out but so far enjoying it. Merry Christmas one and all! See you out there
---
No one cares about your sentiments, keep playing this rubbish game. Hope you get hacked lol
---
Why blueprint?
---
I dig the theme you're going with though!
---
I'm not a parental human being. I had to raise my two sisters since my mom had a stroke and my stepdad ended up in jail for abusing us so I'm over the parenting thing but I just don't understand people who can hurt their kids.
---
Must murder elf, god has commenced it!
---
No nothing is shared but your items and your purchases from the atom shop.
---
Merry Christmas and to all a good nuclear night!
---
You nailed it with the politics reference.
---
Are you on adventure mode?
---
It was horrible how they kept teasing him. They are cold hearted scumbags
---
Merry Christmas, and remember we are all here to have fun.   
---
Except the trolls they are here to kill the game, ignore them.
---
I am looking forward to doing exactly this! Leveled up a new toon during the double XP weekend and didn't touch any of the main quests. Now at level 65 and built up, I'm going to start picking up from the overseers camp and go from there :-)
---
Happy Holidays. Merry Xmas. Cheers!
---
I’m with ya, Vault Brothers &amp; Sisters. Happy Christmas
---
Merry christmas wastelander!
---
Especially being it's just a kid. They honestly got off on it.
---
So is this problem actually fixed now?
---
What a cunt.
---
At least you played the game before beibg critical of this game and are not trying to bash fans for &lt;insert nonsensical reason here&gt;.
---
Honestly i would not be surprised if up to1/4 of ppl on this sub never played and just bash bc their fav yter bashes game (while not playing or researching claims btw), they hate bethesda bc they are not obsidian, or just hate everything and apparently have advanced degrees in economics, psych, and comp tech so are qualified to tell us how to spend our own money.
---
Thank you Merry Christmas to you as well!
---
Have a wonderful holiday!
---
You also share atom challenges. So if you complete on one mule, it will be done on the other as well
---
That's awesome go spread the Christmas cheer!
---
Nothing is shared, except for Atomic Shop purchases and Atoms. Except for scrap/repair kits from the Atomic Shop, those are given to the current selected character at time of purchase.
---
Amazing Home Alone reference. ;p
---
What a fucking awful Atom shop update.
---
what are the rewards for the challenges?
---
Has it gotten any better? I haven't touched it since May.
---
That's the good stuff right there. Hang in there byellets!
---
So disappointing. There are too damn many things vaulted. Half of this weeks returning items are icons and banners. In the absence of new game content at least give me access to atom store items I can play around with. I think I'm just going to take a break from this game...
---
A "few" players affected? How about the Youtube video where a player literally does the hack to dozens of players? And that's just one user. So glad I uninstalled this dumpster fire months ago. Probably won't be coming back for the wastelanders update either. Shame on you Bethesda.
---
Oh my god.   
---
they're on PC right? I'd love to make up a bunch of holiday gifts for the kid and drop them to him for Christmas. :(
---
I reported a simple bug with just the information, no bias or anything.  Got downvoted.  There are some people who just like to poke misery at others.
---
Then I suppose that explains why you spend most of your time in the basement. Matt case, dress cool if you try that thing called 'outside' but still, don't forget your helmet.
---
Per the above post. We find the love and positivity in it regardless of the latest issues and drama's. It's all about who you choose to share it with my friend. Merry Christmas!
---
There's another video? I only saw the one of some asshole robbing 500+ people.
---
I have a 3 star troubleshooters minigun I named "codsworths revenge". For me he always died to a warlord with a minigun so I thought it was appropriate.
---
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you.
---
It saves the contents and pricing. At least, last time I did it it did. Not sure if it's changed since then.
---
Game could definitely be better and critics should always push to make it so, but it’s still fun overall when it works well. Here’s to hoping it’ll just improve in the new year when the NPCs join everyone in the wasteland.
---
1. I don't really understand the science behind it either, also you have to rejoin the same server for it to work.
---
2. It doesnt matter which peice if ultracite you pick up as long as it's one you took before quitting the game.
---
No one asked for your opinion here.
---
Poor Mass Effect T\_T
---
Damn all I ever want it more
---
Mr pebbles stuff
---
Dude you really are stretching if you can’t move on from those things lol. If they really honestly make you mad, I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Merry Christmas all around Appalachia!
---
Enjoy your time with your family, friends and with the game!
---
There's another video focused on one kid. The hackers swarmed him, stripped him of all his gear and trolled him on mic while he cried.
---
Have you sent that link to Bethesda?
---
Very much so, my friend.
---
Ho ho ho - oh everyone appears to have died. This is terrible
---
I may have tried Fallout 4 a long while ago, but I know for sure games like Hunt: Showdown and Rainbow Six run pretty good, so that may just be the case; thanks for the input!
---
Either add a set 20 more hit damage or something like less vats cost against players. Something useful
---
I just provide low-effort shitposts to try and make people laugh.
---
You forgot how the internet works mate? No one asked for yours either yet here you are lmao
---
I should probably rename it seeing how it shreds thru silos
---
Same as all my weapons. I lack creativity.
---
0-10mm Pistol  \*
---
0-.308 Sniper Rifle
---
0-Combat Shotgun \*\*
---
I just like my go-to items at the top. Wish they'd up the limit on renaming.
---
Disappointed they didn’t add in the stuffed Rudolph Radstag from last year. Really wanted to do a makeshift sleigh with them
---
Garbage
---
Don’t forget, some of the stuff is just others venting who were disappointed. I’m still playing, still having fun, but I get where some of the negativity comes from. Just don’t engage in it outside of when it’s appropriate.
---
Are the holiday string lights only able to be put on ceilings, or can they go on walls or other surfaces? I bought the set from 2 weeks ago and it's okay, but if these can't be used anywhere but ceilings and under floors, then that's a hard pass for me, dawg.
---
But, I think I will buy the blue suit. I have a character that wears suits, and I've got the Halloween one, might as well have a Christmas one too.
---
Bethesda is aware of the site and player as it’s practically on the main page google search now.  
---
I do hate these guys.  
---
Vermacide, Peace60, BodegaTheKid, Grushnak, Skippy
---
These are some of the IGNs involved and related in the recent hacking thing
---
There is proof the hack exists, just not that items can be taken. They can still deposit anything freely into your inventories. If the entire thing hasn’t been removed, then it’s only a matter of time for a workaround. Until they start making the server confirm what the client is doing, the server will blindly accept everything you do as correct
---
PC is having a rough time right now with a new hack.  On XB it’s doing ok.  If you’ve been out so long, maybe wait for the wastelanders announcement and hop in right before it launches.
---
inb4 downvoted to the bottom-most pit of hell but many people in this thread seems so ravenously adamant on damn near ruining these hacker's lives just because they made mods for a buggy ass game with garbage support. Sorry fellas but this not it at all.
---
I've lowered all my settings to the lowest resolution and sliders before, and it didn't help much at all last time. I may try again, but it seems to be something else haha.
---
I didnt know people started calling bethesda trolls lmfao
---
Yea quit, pay for a game that won't rip you off, give you shit service, and allow hackers to rain havock. Why would you pay for the state of this trash?
---
The sad thing is the players that are mostly affected are the die-hards. Most of the casuals moved on a long time ago. Shame that the game they enjoy so much is literally being ruined by the bad apples. I know how hard it was to grind for that decent to good piece of gear. Having that wiped away in an instant would infuriate me.
---
Yes i crafted it dropped it then made one for my self then we both put it on. My friend doesn’t have it yet
---
I just completely reinstalled my OS and removed all programs and files yesterday \[with updated drives\], and the problems still persist. It's prolly something else maybe.
---
" small number of characters "
---
Yeah, a couple hundred or so people. Small, right?
---
Merry Christmas dwellers
---
They even removed an endgame activity they already had going for it when they took down survival mode after totally butchering it.
---
Well, while you may have a different experience with how this method worked for you I tested for a few hours before recording the video. The tutorial is accurate and your explanation didnt add any extra information as to how you make this method work. Everyone else seems to have found it useful and it is working for them. As for your accusation of "stealing it from others", if you look in the description of the video and even in the body of this post I have stated I am not the founder from the very beginning.
---
full of starving crocodiles, yes
---
Dang, I might need that fire breathers excavator paint...I want that responders bunker gear clothing more though and I never really use my PA
---
Yeahhh, I tried naming a .50 Calibur Sniper Rifle "The Last Thing You'll Never See" in mad respect for Boone. Sadly I could not, but don't worry about the creativity. It takes me a solid 20 minutes to think of a name!
---
Perhaps it's related to my laptop and the inventory slogging it down, because I've seen others with a large inventory with no problems at all!
---
If you want easy win stuff like heals and repairs then you can P2W some of the game.
---
Yeah, that's usually the reaction I expect when I tell people the truth.
---
Oh and one warning, there's a fair bit of jingle-jangling in these tracks, so if you're out farming Santa Scorched you might have to curb your expectations. :P
---
Thanks for that testimony, seems this might be more common an issue that I thought!
---
With the method I show in the video you don't have to keep fast traveling away like he has suggested.
---
I criticize when it’s worth criticizing. You started posting her yesterday entirely about the hacking. It all seems suspect honestly.
---
The problem is that it's an online game hosted on Bethesda's servers, which pretty severely limits modding potential. If they'd implemented player-hosted private servers, server mods would still be feasible, but as is, I'm not sure how that would work.
---
What about the skeptics that don't trust social media posts by anonomous users?
---
I meant what I said, nothing more. Also why the cyberstalking bud?
---
Can still drag mobs in to destroy the walls
---
I agree, and I'm not trying to be dismissive of the OP's good intentions. It's good to be cautious, I'm just personally not going to believe anything at face value or disconnect any vendors until something more substantial comes up.
---
Stay positive and spread the love chum. That's the good stuff!
---
Merry Christmas, and as it says in the cave trap at my C.A.M.P. "Welcome to hell."
---
Does anyone know if the giant letters are lights or  classed as wall deco?
---
Hate to admit it but having the scrap box from fallout first is a definite qol thing no more junk management
---
I agree with you. Unfortunately you can't just ask people to stop doing something.
---
Like with Amazon, everyone knows they treat their employees like shit, everyone knows their shameful business practises. Everyone knows they don't need to pay taxes. 
---
Everyone knows tobacco is bad for you. Yet people still buy into that as well.
---
We're all stupid humans. But if Bethesda wants us to just eat our cake and shut up. Maybe if we as a community said no and started harvesting heads, that sheer force might conjure up some action by Bethesda to, oh I don't know, be a better company rather than slapping bandaids on a 1950s apocalyptic shit-code and release another 50gig patch to maybe fix their broken bullshit they sold to us for full retail price. Maybe we can all finally get the game we paid for rather than hope their presumed hotfix can solve something. 
---
But. We'll be complacent with a bandaid. We'll start seeing posts of people titled; "Bethesda acted pretty fast, considering."
---
"I really enjoy this game."
---
"Thanks Bethesda, this event is awesome."
---
We're stuck in a loop.
---
As far as I know, data sent to and received from the server is already in encrypted format. But that does not prevent this type of hack, because it injects client code that creates a malicious "item transfer" message that is then encrypted and sent to the server by the original client code. Obviously, the fix is that the server should properly check the messages received for valid arguments: for example, reject item transfers from/to another character's inventory or stash.
---
Both sides eh? Only one of those types giving all the money to the rich and tax cuts to mega corps..but yeah yeah..both sides. Sure.
---
Merry Christmas!!!
---
Good all year? How about a few days during the year?
---
Merry Christmas everyone
---
Yeah I’m not to worried about losing my stock. Only takes a few hours to replenish, I only really sell ammo, meds, food and drink
---
Possibly but a lot of these hacks are all because of the same weakness and this isn’t the first...
---
Thanks.
---
"Silo Pillager" or something.. lmao
---
Could say why not or please do this 1000 times to the devs on this game. So much is broke or makes no sense, it's not worth your breath anymore
---
Bethesda: "Hey here's Fallout 1st"
---
Stop making excuses for this shit please.
---
I love the game. 
---
I love the humour of the various bots. 
---
I love the landscapes. 
---
I love the sad vignettes around Appalachia. 
---
I love collecting gear for weeks then throwing it out. 
---
My favourite thing in the game is setting up an ASAM and defending it against Scorchbeasts. The fire,  the noise,  the fun of it. 
---
It has massive problems,  but I love it anyway.  
---
"I'm scootgar, I'm an addict. "
---
I have not played in a while, are they kicking people from servers so fo1st people can use those servers?
---
SBQ, SB, and mirelurk queen claw. Everything else is released.
---
Heck, at this point they might just sell nude mods.
---
Yeah, it makes me so upset people are like that. Here’s the vid for those that haven’t seen it (https://youtu.be/gJrFCIdvvZw) and the kid’s IGN is listed.
---
Thanks for the idea man. I’m going to add the kid and give him my farmed gifts 🎁
---
Appreciate it!
---
if you manage to get in contact and they are still up for playing the game message me I've loads of kit low to high levels he/she can have to get back into it with.
---
Lets just agree on this: the game was shit but is now getting better. But we shouldnt just act like its all good now either, otherwise this will happen again
---
Something they SHOULD do but isolation isn't the answer. Would be nice if the kid had help getting his gear back. I didn't even stick around to see what gear they stripped nor am I rewatching it.
---
Merry X-Mas to you as well. I'll seeyou out there.
---
You sure don't sound like a 'server programmer' because  well.. you're not aware why not being able to implement checks because the client doesn't support it is a severe problem.
---
What a curious analogy.
---
Merry Christmas my fellow vault dweller! It has been a year, but it was worth it meeting all the interesting and awesome people out there. I remember one time I was exploring near A slocum Joe's and there is this odd fellow trying to actually figure out the land, he sounded like a british explorer, he said "Quite right, good day!" I'll never forget moments like that, only in that wonderful post-apocalyptic world of West  Virginia. 
---
I love this game and it's awesome in game community.
---
Basically when people noticed that dead bodies were spawning in private servers Bethesda said something along the lines of, "The players must've gotten the wrong impression of how looting containers works" rather than, this place has already been cleared. Now people think that the servers weren't private and that somebody cleared the place before them or that the servers were all interconnected but "invisible people" were in it, but my theory is the random death tick that happens. I've seen a lot of scorched just randomly die in one area.
---
 I've made so many friends in 76. It will always hold a special place in my heart just for that.
---
Considering that the video is less than 5 minutes and only shows 1 clip of me actually doing the method for 25 seconds and I only 2 horses of scorched I'm not sure where you are pulling yoir false accusations from. Legendary spawns are clearly random, sometimes none spawn and sometimes uo to 3 can spawn. Over the course of an hour you can get up to 100 if you kill them fast enough.
---

---
Guess they drank too much egg nog at the Vault Tec holiday party
---
Happy Holidays family!
---
Yes I must be fucking something up.
---
Tried private and adventure.
---
Can never get the nodes bugged to where I can keep clicking them.
---
Always solo which I didn't think should matter
---
Omg that is the best idea🤣🤣🤣😩
---
Merry Christmas to everyone. Not just some people.
---
They took my helmet said it was more dangerous with it on
---
Even better...logging in to just your head floating.
---
Here’s the video https://youtu.be/gJrFCIdvvZw, I’ll pm you his IGN
---
If you’re on Xbox, I’ve got quite a few spares in my vendor if you’re looking for something. I’m on Xbox btw
---
I'm not going to watch it. After I get the kids name I'm deleting this post. Not looking for karma.
---
A fantastic festivus
---
Because the job 'server programmer' doesn't exist. If they were a 'server programmer' they would have said they were a software developer...
---
What issues are actually causing you trouble right now?
---
That Snally, so damn elusive. Sloth is the coolest looking.. maybe the big frog. 
---
The Queen claw and both SB heads aren't out yet.
---
thanks.
---
Awesome post.
---
 🎄
---
So does it mean if i keep some holiday gifts and open them when the rest of the mounts were released, i will get the plans?
---
I remember hacks being everywhere since cs 1.6 days when I started gaming. I think it's not that there are more of them, it's that the games being hacked became more popular and mainstream.
---
These are in the shop today for 500
---
It was said to have been fixed in the (yet to be released) Wastelanders version of the game. We will see once it is out. There was also a recent patch that attempted to backport the fix, but that ended up breaking many other things, so it was reverted quickly to the old code where the effect is still broken.
---
Nuka-Nog.
---
This with 33% vats chance. It makes a world of difference
---
Merry Christmas to you! I still love this game!
---
Merry Christmas!     I still enjoy playing with my brother.  We still have fun.   Although I would like if they would fix the game crashing on the PS4 at random times.    I really hope the wastelanders update is great.      Hopefully they will let us trade in duplicate perk cards too.
---

Just another fun day in Appalachia!!  Great job

How did you make the presents?

I can give it to you, add Uncle_hamed then join my server in 20 mins.

Not that it matters now but the footage in the video is actually from the same person. The one was passed around privately on Friday, but then asked to be shared to raise awareness. I asked the person who created it to demonstrate it for me so I could show the perspective of a regular user getting hit and test out the extent of it. 
---
Footage is from the same person at two different times, not ErectBan.
---
Or fertilizer.
---
Sadly not the first time it has happened in this game.
---
There are some serious scumbags in this game, there are even some scumbags that pretend to be taking care of the scumbags in this game.
---
Reddit always shines a light on how great this community is but always seems to turn a blind eye to the people who legitimately bully and harrass people well beyond the scope of acceptable game play.
---
Very very slowly lol... There's a little bug with ultracite and spawning, where if done right, you can use the same ultracite vein to spawn  infinite hordes right next to you lol
---
This is exercising rationality in the extreme, which of course is irrational in itself. There are a series of bank robberies and the police should ?
---
A) Stakeout health food stores  as they may be robbed even though several banks have been robbed and they receive a info that another one is too be robbed.
---
B)Stake out the banks.
---
What does it look like?
---
I don't play this game, but merry Christmas.
---
I hope y'all get the game you deserve.
---
I think if they add mods in a pro-player way the game's longevity will be guaranteed. FO4 still has a healthy playerbase in large part because of mods, and that game is 4 years old + was also somewhat maligned at launch (not critically, but lots of 'true fans' bitched about the changes to dialogue and progression). 
---
However, if they strangle mods by putting all sorts of barriers around them or trying to over-monetize them, who knows. Overzealous monetization is a disease and it can be terminal when the base game isn't polished enough.
---
At this point I give the game at least 2 years, but if that timeline involves a lot more problems and bad press and anti-consumer moves to get money, then it could end sooner.
---
Merry Christmas!!! 🎄

I use bobby pins as a second source of caps. Not only do they have no weight, they have a use AND you can buy and sell them at robot venders. Why are people using the 55.6 ammo? Makes no sense. Bobby pins are thee real alternative here!
---
Merry Christmas! It’s been a while since I’ve been in but I’m loading up now! Thank you
---
More than likely no. The gifts have a set loot table they pull there rewards from. They would have to give the gifts a new loot table to make new items drop as rewards which they probably won't do for the current gifts for this event.
---
I agree
---
Chill bro. I played till last week and that spawn anything hack was the last straw. 1.5k hours played and always ready to return. I do believe I deserve a say
---
I've been playing since beta and I've put every single note and holotape I've ever gotten into my stash.  I also have a collection of 200+ armor pieces on there.  I've noticed my game seems to lag quite a lot more on my main, especially in crafting and inventory menus, compared to my other characters that have far less items in their stash. 
---
I definitely think the number of items in your inventory/stash has an impact on how laggy it is.

Let’s not forget that BGS devs have straight up admitted that they don’t won’t or can’t learn any new engine because of how hopelessly hooked they are on their 20 yr old engine. If I remember right Todd Howard pushed some bullshit like “using the same engine allows us to create things quickly and efficiently” what a bunch of horse crap. I think what he meant to say was, “we can copy and paste half of the resources with half the skill”
---
Be wary of hackers, and merry Christmas!
---
Merry Christmas fellow vault dweller! :)
---
Hah, I just posted a Christmas Fallout playlist too! Good to see folks will have plenty to listen to. ;)
---
Excuse me, can you provide examples of these mods you work so hard on?
---
Well, we're not exactly allowed to call them out thanks to Rule #9.
---
Aw. Kinda disappointing.  Xmas and nothing to spend my atoms on.   Is it me,  or did the winter wonderland skins price drop?
---
That is very kind of you but alas I have removed the game for my computer. I ha e a giant backlog of games I’ve been meaning to get to and my interest in the game have. Been waning for months now this was just a last straw/ the kick I needed, to move on. You should totally give the coat to someone for free though, make someone’s Xmas exciting!
---
Yeah. At xmas too.
---
That's every game unfortunately. The ones doing the trolling are simply taking out on others as an outlet do to their miserable upbringing. Hopefully one day those doing the trolling will one day reflect on how they treated others. Especially a kid
---
Snally was one of the first I got! It’s pretty awesome. Still waiting in gorill head
---
Well that is a little different from the normal posts that start with "I don't play but..."
---
I totally get it, that spawn anything hack was insane.
---
Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays!
---
Sounds like the remaining pc population
---
lol i u wonder why i dont come to this piece of shit reddit no more, as soon as you dont agree with this stupid game fanboys down vote you like crazy.
---
Man you guys are killing Bethesda, turning it into the next AE.
---
Merry Christmas and a happy new year fellow wasteland wanders! May tons of large holiday gifts be under your tree and stockings full of stable flux
---
I purchased the TE (oh, so many regrets) and have been playing since the BETAs - the fact that I decided to join the subreddit where a minority of the playerbase gathers shouldn't disqualify me from speaking about the game. I thought this was the nicest, most welcoming community of them all! How disappointing.
---
You keep going with your narrative and your exaggerated analogies, bud. I made my point.
---
Appreciate people like you keeping us informed. Thx :)
---
No but we can address the issue even without naming and shaming, it leaves this false impression that everything is hunky dory in Appalachia when there are legitimately terrible things happening to people.
---
I bought the excavator paint this summer. It's pretty sharp looking
---
...there are fucking corpses everywhere.
---
I will 😀
---
And now some of them are dressed up as Santa. Your point?
---
I like how we come together as a team to fight the SBQ. 
---
The fights where its inside the nuke zone and there's a furball fight going on with all the other baddies are the most fun.  At times it becomes everyone for themselves but it comes together with folks stimming others that are downed, letting others take their shots at a 3-star, and at the end when we are all blasting the SBQ.
---
True. I loved that franchise so much.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Merry Christmas to those who have stuck with this game since day 1!
---
**Junk:** Scrap it all down, except items you may want to display/sell or use in crafting/quests. 
---
Don’t keep more than 100 max of any junk type (except perhaps rare/expensive such as Ballistic Fiber/Black Titanium/Ultracite) until you know what you’ll use on a regular basis.  
---
Tag only the junk types that you know you need regularly or are scarce. (Example: I’d tag Adhesive since that’s used in all repairs, but not Steel because it’s so abundant).
---
If you’re above 100 for any common junk, bulk it and sell it to a vendor bot or list it for cheap on your vending machine. 
---
Even without the FO1st Scrap Box, this will keep your scrap weight down very low in your stash. 
---
**Aid items:** You don’t need as much as you think. For chems, unless you’re using one type regularly, sell them. Keep maybe 5 at most, just in case. For the ones you use regularly, 20 is more than enough. You probably don’t need as much Rad-X as you think, especially since it suppressed mutations. Convert some to Diluted Rad-X and sell the rest. I don’t keep more than 20 DRX at a time and less than 10 RX, just in case I need to craft more DRX. 
---
RadAway is more situational; keep enough to manage your Rads in the field. 
---
**Stimpaks:** Decide if your build needs Standard or Diluted. Anything over 100 (unless you’re going on a major run) is probably not needed. Be aware that you can’t revive an ally with Diluted; it has to be a Standard.
---
**Food:** cook all your food but sell what you don’t need. You can always get more. For basic survival, Corn Soup is amazing. Plant plenty of corn at your Camp. Build near a water source. Stock up on wood. You’ll be able to craft as much Corn Soup as you would ever need, and it’s 10% Food &amp; 15% Water. Stay topped off to get the Well Fed/Well Hydrated bonuses, and hot key it to your favorites wheel. You can also make more when you need. For all other food, just keep the ones that give you buffs that are useful to your build. For the pre-war food, the only one I keep is irradiated Sugar Bombs, to make Sweet Rolls when I’m going on a vendor run. All the rest like InstaMash &amp; Mac &amp; Cheese get vendored. But learn the Cranberry Relish recipe and plant some gourds in your camp. Keep a stock available of this for the best food-based XP bonus in the game. 
---
**Alcohol:** Beer, Bourbon &amp; Whiskey. No more than 10 each. The other alcohol are very situational, so unless there’s an effect you really like, just sell them. 
---
**Ammo:* Pick your top three weapons. What ammo do they use?  Stock up on those. For all the rest, keep no more than 1000 rounds (just in case you find a better weapon that uses that type) and list the rest in your vending machine for 1 cap each. Yes, even missiles and MiniNukes. It’s incredibly rare that anyone wants to buy those and I’ve never sold them for more than 5c each and that was to someone that had a very specific build. Be willing to drop them if they don’t sell soon. Or find a fun weapon that uses them and tear up a low level area for kicks.  *Exception: Cores. Those can sell for significantly more. Even if you’re a heavy user of the cores, you likely don’t need more than 20 of either type. You can usually sell them in your vendor for 1/2 of their remaining charge value, but full ones sell better.*
---
**Misc:** Smelt down your ore or sell it if you don’t need the extra junk. There aren’t any perks/effects that change their weight so you can keep those in your stash if you really want.  In fact, any Misc item with weight that you don’t need to keep on you at all times, stash it. I keep my Nuke Code Cards on me and I think that’s it really.
---
**Weapons &amp; Armor:** If it’s not one of your mains/backups or one you’re *willing* to make a main in the future... scrap them or sell them. For legendaries, if they have poor effects (like... Nocturnal...), scrip them. If they have good effects that are in demand, sell them in your vendor.  If you’re not sure of their fair **market** value, check out the *other* FO76 sub for guidance.  But in general, about 100 caps per scrip value is a good place to start, and you can adjust downward if it doesn’t sell or you get a decent offer.
---
I recommend no more than 3-4 ‘main weapons’ and no more than 2-3 armor sets. And that may still be pushing it. 
---
**Clothing:*. Is it used for an Atom Challenge?  Is it a unique &amp; non-repeatable quest reward?  Is it a rare drop?  Is it a piece that you really want to keep because it looks cool for your ‘over clothing’ character outfit?  
---
Then keep it. Otherwise, vendor it. I personally keep one of every clothing item but sell all the duplicates. A man only needs so many pairs of Welding Goggles. 
---
**Power Armor:**. At maximum, 3 chassises. Unless you’re trying to be a PA dealer, you really only need a level appropriate set for mining/carry weight (Excavator) and combat (personal preference, but I like the T-51). Maybe a version for Rad Zones (X-01 is what I like for that). 
---
Rename those chassises so you know which is which. For the rest, you can repair/scrap the pieces for the Atom Challenges, or donate them to lower level players. I just dropped 7 PA chassises in front of Vault 76 the other day with a fresh Fusion Core in each. That’s 70 lbs freed up. 
---
That’s all I can think of. This approach has helped me keep my stash weight low and makes the management a lot easier.
---
Merry Christmas and happy New year!
---
lol. Nice deflection.
---
Yeah, I have also seen it in other communities, I try to make the point that our community is no different than others because of it.
---
76 does seem to keep the same trolls longer than other communities though, I don't know if that is due to the nature of the pay model or something else but many of the worst offenders are names that have been around a long time.
---
You win this topic. Merry Christmas to you and everyone else here.
---
Two Gulpers vs alpha death claw they beat it. Just a little tidbit the gulpers are actually hellbender Salamanders.
---
Thanks :)
---
&gt; . . . instead blame the low quality programmers who scrapped this netcode together.
---
Wow, asshole much?
---
As a 'server programmer' you should know that its not the programmers making these decisions.  They do what they can with what they have.
---
This *is* an engine problem (and I say that as a defender of the Creation engine - its very good for making certain types of games) and its is an management problem.
---
The code-monkeys are slinging code as best they can - its management that decided to tack on this netcode, in this condition, without testing and without paying attention to what really needs to be in place to secure a multiplayer network.
---
Those neon letters are badass. That's a yep for me, as they suit my current build perfectly!
---
This just makes the gross incompetence extra pathetic.
---
Huh.  The granddaughter has a holo too, right?
---
Well you can get the suit finally
---
This game is weirdly addictive and I don’t know why I’m still playing but merry Christmas
---
All of my stuff was stolen yesterday because I didnt honestly think Bethesda would let a hack go live. Glad you're having fun, but I just cant bring myself to log back on.
---
Weird stuff. I just opened all of mine. One icicle lights finally and my second plasma granade since the event started plus the gorilla head finally. Strangely I have multiple spare santa crashes and several of the deer heads already.  My stash is packed with plans at this point.
---
Because you can make lots of 5.56 not bobby pins and it is much more useful in quantity.
---
My mistake but regardless they still could not make a anti cheat that does it’s job
---
Good news, you can move points after level 50
---
  people need  to   file a class action lawsuit against these morons when you have  5000 hours on a game  plus $1200   tied up in a new pc 
---
its felony vandalism
---
So is your address, I don't feel the need to go seek that when reading your posts.
---
It just strikes me as strange when someone reads a post and suddenly feels the need to read everything they have ever posted.
---
You do you though, I am not ashamed of my prior posts.
---
Because
---

---

---
After all the negative post this was really needed, thank you.
---
Merry Christmas Bros!
---
Your using cbs as a news site for gaming
---
Hang in there chum. The people in this thread chain are the types of people you could come to to get help recovering some things. Stay positive!
---
I haven't made my adress public, and if you were to do so, it would be considered doxxing. So no, it really isn't the same.
---
Oh I realize you are not ashamed. Should you, though? Now that is a different question.
---
Fallout has always been a blend of zany and sad.  If that's not what you're after, maybe you should try something else?  Try Atom RPG, it's 30% off on Steam.
---
God damn free-staters
---
Very lackluster shop update with it being Christmas Eve. And no free item again because of the Santatron.
---
Oh well, Merry Christmas everyone!

I'm busy with Battlefront II at the moment! Pew pew.

Yeah, I've had the opposite, too:  Everything (including glasses) except the head.

---
I like your thinking but nobody can aquire 100k Bobby pins it's just unethical
---
I don't recall so?  He talks to her in the quest holotape, but she passed away before the bombs dropped, the implication being cancer or leukemia.
---
I honestly don't know what you mean by this post. 'Rationality in the extreme' is a contradiction, and your example does not parallel my post in any way I can define.
---
My point was very simple and commonly accepted: Warnings without evidence, especially when they involve somehow debilitating yourself as a precaution (unplugging vendors), are not particularly useful and will likely result in downvotes.
---
Happy New Year friend, my hopes that it's a good one for you!
---
Sorry, noob on PC.  You can message people in game or do you mean here?  
---
I've been on xbox but just started on PC and only level 15 atm.
---
Either way, great community outreach and Merry Christmas!
---
Merry Christmas to the ones that stayed after the beta
---
Merry Xmas! (Even though I don’t celebrate)

A port to the next generation consoles should be relatively easy, it would basically be like running on a higher end PC, same game, but higher graphical settings, frame rate, and resolution. I guess Fallout 4 will also be re-released in a similar way. Whether the game would hold up, it is hard to tell, Skyrim SE still seems to be quite popular on XB1, despite being essentially last gen with minor graphical updates.
---
Doom 2016 is a traditional single player focused title, not live service. For these, it is normal to support them for about a year with patches and DLCs, then stop the updates.
---
When you use an engine meant for a single player game... and kludge in some network code, this happens.  All the problems from the beginning, happen.  This was the laziest re-use of assets and code to make a quick dollar I've ever seen, and it failed.  It FAILED.
---
And what site did it link to
---
Im playing a 15 year old game and having 10x more fun than I ever did in FO76... The age of a game means nothing in terms of enjoyment.
---
Happy holidays folks, and as the meme goes:
---
Merry crisis, :p
---
Merry Christmas to all those who gave this game a shot and loved it all the way through in spite of everything!
---
That's okay. If you don't want to play, then don't play. Tell your friends not to play if you want. Tell strangers not to play, if that makes you happy and feel satisfied. If there are players who are enjoying it and paid for it, then let them enjoy it. The player base is dwindling anyway. I'll keep playing because I have a good time.
---
Is the news incorrect?
---
Wait what?
---
actually it's an hidden door behind a fake nuka machine like we can already see in game for the nukabomb quest.
---
I've been stocking up on Bobby pins too. They are much rarer and harder to acquire. As a second currency it would be great as it is weightless and usable by any character.
---

I’m just saying I never asked for battle royal on game not built for it asked for a rpg like the division which was a good point

The only way is by using what Microsoft is using for windows 10. They are targeting a specific unique bios key that exists on every board. It's a hard coded serial number for the motherboard. Change the board, you get the same need to reactivate windows 10.
---
The clusters of 3 presents are from Nuclear Winter mode-- if you play one or two games you will likely unlock them, they don't require much. You can also get the green wreath that way.
---
The single presents on the display shelves are from the holiday event. You can get them by hunting the Santa Scorched or using a Santatron collector bot. There are three types (small, normal, and large) and they're each a different colour.

Merry Christmas! Have been addicted to the game for weeks having a blast.
---
Yes, handmade presents have better odds than tbe ones dropped from scorched
---
Yes but you are linking to the battle royal and the rpg mode really isn’t a rpg
---

Nope cash. Don't care about a fake ingame currency

Can I get sauce. Because I mean there are people out there who think "oh yeah a kid. Let's bully the fuck outta him" I mean if they're just absolute brats who cry for everything and make death threats because of a minor inconvenience then maybe they deserve it. Otherwise it's just uncalled for.
---
This would be considered an exploit, would it not?
---
I just shorten weapon names enough to add "!-" to the beginning so they're always on the top of my list.  I shorten and add "!!-" to armor and "!-" to Power Armor that way PA is ahead on the list of other armor.
---
) let’s try another way...
---
Which Online RPGs were not effected by hacking ?
---
Maybe before fo1st, to me ammo has *less* value since it can be crafted. With the addition of the scrap box players can farm endless amounts of scrap and make thousands of ammo. However, by main character is already carrying so much ammo, can't imagine carrying 25k 5.56 or whatever in addition to the reserves he already has.
---
Merry xmas friends!
---
I collect Bobby pins because I find lots and there are few places to use them.
---
Link yours! I'd love to listen.
---
Ok. Are you saying it's possible that the kid who was being bullied may have deserved it?
---
Sorry about your brother... 😉

I guess I'll be awaiting my 500 atoms.  :/

Nothing too exciting for me but thank you from all of us at work. I'm holding onto my atoms for new years.

Idk man someone had a mothman mount at their camp and it was so freaking cool and large. That's the only one I would ever want.

Wait....didn’t they charge $21 for the beard and outfit?

Happy holidays you lovely people
---
so true. it only takes one person out of a million to break the silence. there are some haters out there but I love this game and don’t let them dampen my spirits
---
I found a body that had a bucket list (a list of places to visit) and a holotape.  She says she won't get to everything on the list, and asks you to finish it for her.  Not positive it's the same story, but it seems possible.
---
Thank you for the information, the sooner these hackers are shut down for good the better.
---
Not a single one but 95 percent not to this scale
---
Deflection of what? Keep your head in the game, my dude, you are spinning right now.
---
A new AAA Fallout is unlikely in the next decade or so, this type of game takes years of work to develop by hundreds of people nowadays, and BGS still has to make Starfield first, then TES VI. Wastelanders is likely meant to be the closest thing to a fresh start, or at least the first major step towards making the game more successful. If 76 is given up on, there will just be no Fallout for a very long time, other than next gen re-releases of FO4, mobile spin-offs, and the like. Obviously not good to have to wait so much, but it would not be unusual, considering the gap between Skyrim and TES VI.

I think there's likely a fair bit of overlap, as I built part of this list from compilations included in your own playlist. xD

Toxic Valley.  There are two daily quests there that can spawn whole herds of them (Big Game Hunter at Black Bear Lodge, and Thrill of the Grill at Hemlock Holes).

No its not.

Congrats.  You're now an NPC.

How pretentious.  
---
"and the reason that every day you log in you're proving all of the angry people wrong."  
---
 You realize some people have legitimate problems with this game, right? They're angry because this game is a turd no matter how you look at it. People have been scammed, lied to over and over, banned for the dumbest reasons, and insulted by the meager responses bethesda has actually given to these legitimate complaints. And yet, you dismiss them as "angry people". Others call them "Trolls".  
---
It's fine if you want to enjoy playing a bad game because you have friends to play it with. More power to you. I can certainly understand THAT. But I don't understand the sentiment behind this post. You gloss over the fact that you're playing unacceptable, unpolished trash as though having a community surrounding it validates a purpose for this game to exist in the state that it's in. Like people who want this game to actually give something of \*value\* to them and others instead of lumps of coal, are being called out because it doesn't abide by the defensive, and almost cult-like status quo on this sub. "Either love this game or hate it".
---
You basically are using the “I know you are but what am I” defense.
---
So if security is used correctly then the following should mean it is impossible to steal.
---
The term "Challenged" means the server sends you, your public key and you respond with your private key.
---
1) You request a trade with me. Client to server request and you are challenged.
---
2) The server sends a request to me to offer a trade and challenges me to accept.
---
We are now in a trade.
---
3) You request my handmade. The request is sent to the server and are "challenged".
---
4) I choose to set a value and send the command to the server and am challenged.
---
5) You choose to accept the value and are challenged.
---
That covers trade. The same logic can be applied to the stash box but without step 4.
---
Because you don't have my private key, you can't take anything from me.
---
i mean, this is all on bethesda with how shoddily the game is made, and how slow them taking action has been
---
Is that a good or bad thing?
---
That paint really is nice, it's on my Excavator.
---
Especially with such minimal reward for a bounty
---
I have noticed a weird thing with that fridge where even though you can’t add Mentats to it, it will display the Mentats from my stash as if they are in the fridge when I open it (particularly Berry Mentats for me). Does the same thing with Ionized Meat. It’s not actually creating the items for me, just displaying what’s in my stash. It kinda made me freak out the first time too thinking it was spontaneously generating new chems, but I’m pretty sure that’s what’s going on for me, so that may be what’s happening to you also.
---
Good I suppose.  You gave great detail of what you wanted, so no one should be confused on what to do.
---
I'm sure that, in your mind, I am. 
---
Again, what am I deflecting? You haven't made a single point to argue over, so I don't know what you want me to say, really.
---
Got it myself yesterday to try and take all the workshops. I did it. But it's hard to manage. I figured I would not have to defend them and my Santatrons would just give me loads of presents. I got some before I lost the workshops. However, I did reduce my weight drastically. Nice.
---
Na thats a pretty decent reward considering you have options on what to get.
---
That logic doesn't make sense. The hackers who are going to exploit this didn't learn about it from some YouTube video. But at least if regular players are warned, they can stay away from the game until it's patched.
---
Some christmas stuff has already left the store, for some reason, so perhaps it has already left(I dont know what was in a week ago hadnt played that week)
---
Depends on what you are looking for, here is a list that will help you:

---
Dear God... The chosen one is upon us...
---
Verdic, this sums up how I’ve been feeling. You expressed it very well. Merry Christmas to all!
---
Merry Christmas!  
---
Still loving the game as well!
---
That's not the holiday string lights, unless I'm missing it in the picture?
---
Idk I didn't see the video but definitely not if your ranting here.
---
If you didn't see the video then you obviously don't know what you're talking about. And if you DON'T know what you're talking about then maybe you should keep your assumptions to yourself.
---
bodega and grushnak are the same guy, aka vonwiclehofer, aka 90smemelord
---
Why would you post this? Like let people have a good thing.
---
Bet if it was the Atom Shop having issues it would of been fixed in a heartbeat.
---
It may not be practical to manually restore items for those that were hacked, especially if there were 1000+ players affected. But if they keep an inventory snapshot for the last time a user loaded into a server, it would probably be possible to automate a restoration process.
---
You can also try a 'no food' build. With the cannibal perk and the one that reduces rads from food (I forget the name), I've run my character for months with only water and grilled radstag (for emergencies and the carry weight bonus). Saves a signifiacnt amount of weight.
---
Merry Christmas vault dwellers .....
---
960 for the elf? Woof, this is going to be a close one.
---
I use an instigating explosive lever as my main rifle and TSE laser as a backup   and a primed anti armor gatling plasma for SBQ events. My main armor is Vanguard with rad resist.
---
The Vault-Tec experiment continues...
---
I’ve been having this issue for months. I’ve had armor and guns disappear. I’m on PS4.
---
Not a big.
---
Why are you on a sub for such a "turd" of a game? Why not let it go, and find something you enjoy to spend your time on?
---
Walls is still the correct answer
---
Yeah sorry about that. A little strained on caps so I added a 250 increase to increase the reward to 7,750 instead of 5,500.
---
I mean, I love this game and I love the work Bethesda has done, I just wish bethesda would do more and in a more timely manner.  
---
I dont really hate any more, at least I try not to hate on things, lifes too short to hate things all the time, so even if something isnt good, i will still try to find the good points in it.  
---
FO76 is buggy, unstable, riddled with security issues and lacks a real end game, these are true.  
---
However, it is also has a really well crafted map, looks really good, has really well voiced and written lines, lets me meet new people and play with friends and is changing (albeit very slowly) to fix the issues that are present.
---
Merry Chrysler to all (except those ass wipes who kill you just for fun, y’all can fall off a cliff into cactus).
---
wait you made the wrong choice of deleting a broken and terrible game??
---
If u r jumping on the same place u will be visible not like with the chameleon armor
---
[Guess I'll only be selling items worth less than a cap.](https://imgur.com/gallery/Nbc6rXo)
---
Come get your fertilizer, .38, .50 ball, and syringer ammo hackers!
---
Right, because only big issues should be reported. Not like there’s an Unofficial Bug Roundup or anything similar
---
The fix was already underway when you posted this... no idea why they should give a free month of fo1st if you arent going to keep paying for it,what would be the point?  As a whole, not that many people were affected by it.
---
i now you need so many hours to get them all
---
Everythng gets downvoted here, either bots or really upset people who make it their mission to downvote everything
---
yes. i have been doing this for days at Fissure Sites
---
Don't you get Daisy cutter from a mission anyways?
---
I have a 1* instigating hunting rifle
---
Sorry for the response. Saw you edited your comment after I posted mine. But it doesn’t feel like it’s working as intended, as the entire point of Weightless (aside from reduced weight) is that it states it doesn’t interfere with the Chameleon mutation, however it is while not equipping a weapon
---
Don't forget the challenge of playing without getting hacked.
---
Oh interesting, there's a female variant it seems?  Neat!
---
You are wonderful, Merry Christmas my friend.
---
Thanks. I haven't had a chance to use them. Always died before I could. Now it'll be a priority.
---
I've gotten 3 Snallygasters. Still need a Radscorpion, Mothman and Mirelurk King.
---
I get super bobby pin pulls when I spam the box in the first set of lockers before you enter Lucky Hole Mine. I get at least 50-80 depending on server delay.
---
Merry Christmas! And to all a good night. :)
---
Becouse i hope they will make some good faction wars where i can actualy use my gear
---
I mean, my half paragraph post wasted less time than self promoting your own youtube video here.
---
Don't worry OP, you'll get downvoted for suggesting Bethesda's lack of security lead to this. Not even a basic anti cheat for an always online game as a service experience.
---
All online games have hackers but this isn't just the last week, we've been begging for Bethesda to step up security measures for a year. Giving me more reasons to believe a skeleton crew is managing this game anymore.
---
Make some friends who are trustworthy enough to help you transfer to a mule character. I keep all my meds and heavy guns on a separate character even with FO1st.
---
Console. Achievement unlocked.
---
R/woosh
---
I get people still liking the game, they put forth effort to make it and have fixed it a good bit, but for people to remain ignorant of all that's been happening from the game crashes to this new inventory steal glitch, it's not worth playing if you don't wanna have to start over because of Bethesda's lack of testing, they definitely deserve the abandonment and hate they're getting
---
Atoms
---
I like the game, The community is a big part of that.
---
I have just purchased a plan for somebody after telling him I’d keep my eyes open, We haven’t “played” Together, Just randomly added after an event many months ago. 
---
We just message each other now and again with questions/advice. Never spoke. I’m sure he would do the same for me.
---
Its one of the few games where the good eggs outnumber the bad IMO.
---
I don't see it. I'm guessing the op blocked me and now the post is "removed".
---
hay ... just wondering ... whining about the lack of anti cheat cool?
---
I run a Bloodied Melee character, and my “go-to” weapon is a 3* Bloodied Meathook.
---
Her name is Mary...
---
“Bloody Mary”. 😉
---
The game has been out for over a year. If you think it's shit, then that's a valid opinion, but it's ridiculous to write something off, and then spend time following a forum just to crap on it.
---
More specifically, the toxic dry lake just south of the Water Park and just north of the Farms. I tend to find whole low level herds clustered together there. Toss a grendade and BOOM mission accomplished. (Literally.)
---
i have an instigating one with +50 crit damage 
---
not gonna be online until tomorrow (about 16 hours) though  so if youre not getting a better offer in the meantime just shoot me a message 👍🏼

It's easier to put him behind walls and just replace the solid wall with door frame when needed.

Merry Christmas! May your caps be many and your rads be few

Keep the change ya filthy animal...
---
If anybody wants a truly great listening experience in the Wasteland, my gift to you is a radio mod turned Spotify playlist I found in Fallout 4, that was WIPED from the menu.
---
‘Radio ‘Nam’ - it’s a bunch of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi Hendrix, and all of the other 60’s-70’s songs that defined the protest/Vietnam War era. It was a gas in Fallout 4, to switch between that and the pair of ‘80’s Mix’ mods for different music, so I combined Radio Nam’ with the 80’s Mix, and added some of my favorite metal songs, that playlist is in my Apple Music idk if i can share it but uh for real, the entirety of the Fallout franchise like desperately needs to rebrand/ret-con the songs that exist in the universe, because uh, if you can have John Denver, you can have Jimi Hendrix. I don’t care if they write it all off with the divergence, but I want it to be more than just head canon, music is the soul of a cinematic experience, movies, tv shows and video games go under that category, now what I think is, is we get a music cut off around the mid 90’s, and perhaps some day soon we’ll get a real nice playlist out of bethesda, because immersion is being able to just put the music on through the pip-boy, and the whole oldies thing was cute, but the irony really does wear off, especially with the LACK of a Radio DJ(fuck Travis from FO4- a real dj lol)
---
But anyways, if you can recreate it, if i can get back to my point about Radio Nam, they even edited in clips from a wonderfully bleak Robin Williams movie where RW is literally a DJ in vietnam and holy hell that mid had everything, cutting the right clips into the right songs? Freaking amazing. I’m gonna try at some point to recreate it becayse it must be experienced.
---
TLDR; Spotify playlist RADIO NAM for great guerilla gameplay. Nothing like jumping off of the ranger lookout tower in the bog while ‘all along the watch tower’ plays.
---
The 80’s mix is also great. To recreate the 80’s mix you can find the song list through googling, plus you know throw in your own songs. My takeaway though, is I didn’t really like listening to these mainstream songs until i got to play through FO4 with them, and since 76 launched I can’t play without them!
---
Not mad, just taken back by your comment. I don't have "the sauce" because I refuse to give that video any further attention. However someone did link the video in the comments in case you need validation for your dumb opinion. If you're looking to avoid giving that video view that I can give you a short play by play being I turned it off only a few minutes in. 
---
The hackers surrounded a kid maybe no older than 11. They began stripping him of his gear. When he noticed he politely asked "why are you doing this" and "can I please have my stuff back because I worked hard to get it". They laughed and continued taking the rest of his gear while he sobbed. The bullies continued trolling on mic saying "we're giving you a valuable life lesson" while laughing further. There's your "sauce".
---
Either way I don't see how any of this justifies hackers swiping gear from players or why you would have your panties in a bunch over someone creating a post looking to help someone.
---
And people here downvote anything that does shit on bethesda
---
Merry Christmas! I raise a Nukashine to you. See you in Appalachia :)
---
Don’t know why am I being downvoted, just gave my opinion on this, been
---
Merry Christmas and “happy hunting”
---
Merry Christmas, may your 2020 shine like my skin does after I took a swim on the Shenandoah.
---
Alright, sorry
---
It's all about the community for me.. I love to see people helping each other. The amount of times I've seen a player drop items for lower level players, it's refreshing. I've been playing for ages and I never get any grief.
---
Sorry I’m not familiar with the term FMSWA. What does that mean?
---
&gt; 14000 across all platforms.
---
Really?  How do you know that?
---
Every one complained about bundles and now I'm they have been absent.
---
I don't like bundles cause I just play with free atoms. Rather have one or two things for my camp then a whole pack I won't get at all.
---
Merry Christmas and have a Happy Irradiated, but Super Mutant free, New Years..🍺🎄🎉
---
Indeed but the majority of people have no morals anymore.
---
Why did this need to be it's own post? There are several other posts already about the exploit, just comment in one of those.
---
Oh...but then you won't get that sweet sweet karma.
---
O-oh my..
---
Faster movement speed while aiming.
---
Alright I’ll keep that in mind
---
WHY WERENT YOU AT ELF PRACTICE!?
---
Lmao oof
---
34,013 Players Online    
---
30,023 Players Online  
---
22,930 Players Online  
---
One second between each number.
---
It's bullshit.
---
Yeah, but I’ve been waiting all year, it’s really a bummer that people complained ruining one of the only things I wanted in the atomic shop for almost a year.
---
Incompetence is easier to forgive than someone knowingly lying to you to get your money...
---
No Christmas tree, either.
---
I wish I had art of supermuties snuggled in bed eating Sugarbombs. \^\^
---
No he’s not I’ve gotten over 14 of these and started throwing them out, because they weighed too much in my stash.
---
Honestly this years Christmas atomic shop was TRASHHHHHH
---
Who doesn’t want Vader as a teammate?
---
Yeah ok he didn't deserve it and the assholes warrant a disturbance of the peace charge.
---
Damn man, I've tried countless times and never got one.
---
Yeah,  but PS4. Asking for my PC bros.
---
Sorry but I was told I was buying a game, not a year+ beta.
---
"There should never be a single item dupe if done right and things like draining your whole inventory would never even be considered a thing."
---
You're a "server" programmer for sure, LOL
---
...that plasma looks nice.
---
That’s the spirit, thumbs up!
---
I think the ones that tell you need a "smoke" loudly, and constantly, are worse. Cool, bro, you're hitting up, I don't need to hear your bong gurgle every 5 minutes, or you telegraphi you're doing so.
---
That's awesome.  I gather parts in my wasteland roaming as well and slowly piece extras together. T-51b is tops. I use that paint as well. I collect 51s and 60s, mod them and usually sell them cheap. I just collect the t-60 because they are so cheap to repair. About once a month however I find a person that is almost lvl 15 and gift them a fully modded raider 15. I'm not personally a fan of raider but it makes their day. Plus its low lvl. Glad to see others doing things like that too
---
&gt; Meanwhile, in one video it shows 570 some odd players losing all the items they're wearing/carrying.
---
No, the video shows one hacker *claiming* to have hacked 500 odd people.
---
The net code clearly works fine. The issue is security.
---
I've been modding all the T-51 I find with this and selling it cheap in vending. 
---
You're the best!
---
Wrong sub. Please use the other one and be respectful of this sub’s rules. 
---
Siege had a similarly rocky release, and I'm sure there were plenty of people shitting on their game too. It wasn't what was expected, and it wasn't very good in the eyes of the players. Look at it now, one of the top games in Esports and a loving playerbase grateful for their efforts to fix the game and (more importantly) add regular content releases that doesn't break the game every update. It's not wrong of a person to point out genuine flaws in the game, how else would they be addressed and (eventually) fixed? Certainly not by burying your head and pretending it's a masterpiece.
---
I haven't looked through this person's post history, but it's not as if they're rubbing their hands just waiting for the next positive fo76 post to pounce on. Just because someone is negative about a topic and offers a different view doesn't necessarily mean they don't want to see it succeed. It's important to be able to think critically when there is merit, and this game has plenty of merit for criticism.
---
Merry Christmas! I’m not mad about the state of the game but it seems so lonely and empty when I log in. If I knew anybody who still played I’d love to run about West Virginia again. I’ll be back with the wastelanders though.
---
Yes, Karma that’s why I post anything🙄 I have like 3k on account w a year and a half on it I must be a karma whore...
---
It actually was an accident. I meant to write that up on market76.
---
What other sub what is the op saying
---
Player vending is MASSIVE. 
---
If they had added preloaded perk layouts, that might challenge it.
---
https://youtu.be/un8FAjXWOBY
---
Just FYI your santatron (or collectron for that matter) dont need to be able to walk around to collect stuff, they dont actually pick stuff up the station just spawns junk over time, the robot is purely a comsetic to it
---
I believe you keep all rewards
---
He's providing a warning. You're here trying to dissuade people from following that warning.
---
You look like someone trying to keep a target pool available.
---
I get tired of anyone who has their mic on but isn't talking/giving direction or anything. Really tired of hearing people's kids, their mom yelling at them or they're sitting right against their TV so you hear everything twice. Last night I got on the mic just to tell this guy to turn his off because it was just loud background noise. Like, just mute yourself if you're not talking. It's not hard.
---
It is. Horrible. 
---
I have 2300 atoms saved up,  and want none if the items.
---
What’s „Legendary module“ for 50?
---
Technically it would be Anakin bc 20 years too early.
---
Just ask. :) It's not hard to get people to play.
---
Snitches get stitches.
---
An update:  I have been on my main.  Vendors up and running.  Despite reports and forums, I continue to operate a successful vendor.  No issues.  No hacks.  
---
I never intend to spread paranoia or a mood unwelcome in the holiday setting.  I don’t want this game to fail.  I love playing it.  
---
Merry Christmas all!
---
This game doesn't need trolls to kill it, it's already dead
---
i hope you too are just minding your own business and have someone randomly come up and steal all your stuff... js being a fan doesn't mean blindly accepting everything cus "its a fallout thing" they AREN'T EVEN THE CREATORS OF FALL OUT! they are just the current owners of the Ip.   
---
oh yea and todd also promised in the reveal " you will never see a server" 'member that? you 'member  
---
fan of fallout or not. community driver or not. eating trash from the ground will only make you sick. blind consumerism is how we got here. todd does care one bit about any of us as long as he gets his cut.  
---
however the community. you guys are great. but its time to stop fan boying and rally for a better world. a safer fallout experience. a fair experience. one where a anti cheat exists.
---
A few kb, considering how stable the game tends to be after 'update week'
---
There was a big green tree then it got taken off and replaces with the set of shiny ones
---
that's one of the ingredients to craft v94 armour
---
All I want is the one from the 1st Tent... Or the row house at Whitesprings...
---
Why is that too much to fucking ask!?
---
To be fair on the roadmap side of things, they didnt release the first one on wild appalachia until what, February time?  
---
They did say before release they fully intend to keep supporting this game for years though so theres that
---
With fo1 they may make a comeback. That's the whole point Right? 1600 atoms and some perks. Got to give ya something to buy with them.
---
Nothing is ever completely server side, there is always client specific data.
---
Where can I find glowing ones?
---
Veiled threat.  Reported.
---
Merry Christmas fellow vault dwellers and wasteland wanderers. I’ve only had time lately to play for an hour a week and it keeps getting harder to come back and find time to play. 🎄
---
Merry Christmas bought 3 copies of the game for people to join us vault dwellers and await next years updates keep hope!
---
Nice!
---
Man you can't blame people buying fallout 3, new vegas and fallout 4 for the problems in 76... It's completely different problems. The single player games could easily be fixed by an unofficial patch but that is clearly not the case in an multiplayer game? So if you bought into the 76 game and still support it with micro transaction you are keeping a dead game on life support. This was not at all the case with the other games which could be improved infinitely with mods.
---
Nocturnal silenced handmade is the Silent Night
---
I got the plasma grenade plan from a small holiday gift wich was presented me by my santatron in my c.a.m.p. 
---
It’s very ramdom i guess
---
Ya’ll are just sad. 😂
---
Holy fuck.
---
Fucking finally
---
Burned 1000 scrips, the only decent thing I got was an Unyielding Forest Scout Chest Armor with 25 Poison Resistance and 20% Weapon Weight Reduction, the second best was a Bloodied Pickaxe with 40% Faster Swing Speed and +1 Agility, so yes, it's the same bad luck I have every time I run the dices with Mamma 😂
---
A full set of Weapon Weight Reduction armor does an even better job. No nuke zone runs though, since PA negates legendary armor fx and you become massively overencumbered.
---
Devourers sorry^
---
Exactly. This was about one of the only things I looked forward to for Fallout 76, yet it was never delivered.
---
Is there a discount coming at murmrgh’s?
---
I can agree with you on that. Take it with a grain of salt.
---
Regardless of their reasoning, it's a total jackss move. I can only hope that whatever manager of the team responsible for coding or security or whatever this fall under gets an ass-chewing so they can resolve this properly. And when I say resolve it, I mean update patch and it never comes up again, ever.
---
I just have no idea how Bethesda is going to compensate these people for the number of hours lost farming for legendaries. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Happy Holidays..
---
is it wrong the giant letters just seem worth it .
---
Eh, I got downvoted for making a post looking for the IGN of the kid that got bullied from the hackers yesterday. Volunteered to help get the kids gear back and some selfish moron hit the down arrow. It's typical here.
---
There's also a species of salamanders only found in wv it's the cheat mountain Salamander.
---
Wow this game, the dev and the community all need to shut down
---
mystery pick is here, normally there is no such option.
---
Merry Christmas, childrens of Atom. May your legendaries have as many stars as their mobs.
---
Oh i see, thanks!
---
Where to find glowing ones?
---
perfect armour piece from 1k scrip... it's already good luck ;)
---
I don't believe you. There's no way your helmet was more dangerous than leaving that soft spot on your head exposed.
---
Yea I forgot about those. The bong water thing it annoying also
---
Actually all skull like a shovel
---
They did it deliberately because they don't like you.
---
Bethesda honestly have 0 idea how to market any aspect of this game..
---
Amen.
---
Hahahaha 🤣🤣
---
Are they really worth selling in vendors?
---
I agree. the young kids are even worse than the vapors. Yesterday I had to hear a kid get yelled at by his mum then I sat through 3mins of crying until he was killed. lol
---
there is currently 28,655 players online. **500 players were effected by the exploit From a** ***single hacker*****.** just one person  and you call that a small number? the one guy you know about cuz he posted about it. how about the ones that don't brag just shadow it? whats the real count on total effected players? the fact that the number is greater then 1 is an issue. bethsda had a 3 day warning that this hack was coming. and did nothing
---
It came on the third roll and I felt I should stop just there because it would be just downhill after that, like usually is when I decide to spend a good amount of scrips at once, especially on event sales like this, lol
---
You've been able to sprint through them since 2018 without losing rads... Still posts like this smh
---
Please tell me you're dressed up as Santa as well.
---
That has nothing to do with my comment. Also nothing to do with the argument in general. 
---
That said we all have games new and old we enjoy my friend loves Red Dead Redemption 2 and Borderlands I can't stand them - but I don't spend my time bashing them for things I don't like about them either. 
---
I mean I enjoyed Fallout 2 more then 3 4 76 or new vegas since since it was the last true fallout game.
---
Just tried it man. Not sure how fast you’re running but does not work for me.
---
Probably death tick, servers kill off mobs in areas or they'll end up over populated.
---
There's a slim chance of one spawning in any group of max level ghouls, but a nuke zone is the only guaranteed place to find them.
---
As I acknowledged 16 hours ago.
---
Just as bullshit as the claim of there only being a thousand PC players still playing.
---
Darn, I’m on Xbox anyways.
---
I was out and about hoping someone would get my Holotapes. No such luck :(
---
The Mods here don’t seem to like us specifically naming the other sub in question. But a general search of ‘Fallout’ should get them in the right spot.
---
and 90smemelord is a lord of memes about the 90s
---
Is it safe to play yet? Did they patch the main big?
---
oh sorry, thought you asked about the letters :(
---
I accept it for what it is because it's all I needed it to be. It's a video game. People might rage at this remark, but it's exactly that. \*Just\* a video game. I cringe when I think about how angry and inflamed I would get over things like this. But as the years go on i've learned that the things that really matter are the positive impacts you make on other human beings. Aren't most of us in it to live well? Well, that's just my opinion anyways.
---
Both of the extremes are fucking morons
---
Best method to get them is to buy paper to make large handmade gifts. It’s expensive but you’ll at least get other rare plans too that people will be prepared to swap for the one you want.
---
Oh thanks
---
I am on now, and for a couple hours going.  Dropping my second nuke with friends.  I am having fun.  Not a peep of an issue.
---
Wasn't Peace60 the old guy who gets killed 40 times and yelled "sunovabitch" all the time in the one video?  He's a victim then.  I felt so bad for him but couldn't help but laugh at his yelling that every time.
---
Answer : worse
---
Yep, total fanbois and girls. Working for Bethesda was like being touched by God.
---
Not that I’ve personally seen, but as an example when my Int is 6 I get 21 steel with scrapper and and when it’s 5 I get 20.
---
I have to stand still for at least 1-2 seconds before my shower takes my rads out.   Ive walked through it plenty of times without it cleaning my rads. 
---
And i do run a bloody build
---
I never felt like I was being robbed by Bethesda, I bought the game at launch (On disc), and recently bought it again digital, so I don't need the disc in to play, add to that the monthly sub for Fallout 1st, I am happy to continue playing Fallout 76 for the foreseeable future, but then again I will enjoy a game for my own reasons, and never personally jumped on the whine, moan and complain train that was fuelled by social media, I do not need the acceptance of others to enjoy a product that is disliked by some for trivial and petty reasons.
---
That sounds like a slow server issue. I’ve walked through it before and it’s done nothing. Other times it doesn’t matter how long you’re in it.
---
The survivalist outfit! I got it after last week and I absolutely love it. Given I'm a huge sweater fan and it has gloves and boots. It's a glorified mess and I love it.
---
How do you feel about 5,250 caps?
---
**2,000 caps** for two shot
---
**1,750 caps** for crippling
---
**500 caps** for FMSWA
---
+**1,000 cap** bonus for combination
---
This is awesome! Love the paintjob.
---
Heard one ripping on us the other day. His mom came in and asked him to do something and he was like "sure I only got one team mate left so it won't be long." and I was slightly offended but he died before me so lol
---
This does not have any of Quake's netcode in it
---
I’d say give them Legendary Power Armor in the model of their choosing. Maybe just one star, like a whole set of Unyielding or Weightless(chameleon PA 🤣)
---
I’m on console and Unaffected by this but I would honestly need something like that to come back if they aren’t able to restore anything. That, or give them their perfect 3 star weapon, using the tools those hackers were using to build their own legendaries, could be like a 1-time workbench mid or something but i bet that would just end up being exploited, even legendary PA could ultimately end up getting duped huh? This ain’t just scrap boxes eating junk it’s like 60-100 times worse.
---
Yea I can do that.
---
I will operate an open store until I have evidence of this pending issue present itself.  I won’t let the potential for fear monger interrupt my fun.  I will continue to be upfront of news that occurs.  
---
Once again, wishing a Merry Christmas to all.
---
This does not have Quake's netcode in it...
---
It looks terrible, I don’t know why anyone would willingly buy this.
---
Found the Bethesda employee game, is shit and we deserve better from a AAA development studio. You should be ashamed spreading lies, I hope your new years is filled with serve crashes and hackers stealing your gear and ruining your experience.
---
In the end its bethesdas fault no one else.
---
Just blackhole all Traffic from Russian CIDR's. No non-malicious bits come from Russia anyway.
---
I'm surprised at the absence of things like that, as well as the general first round of stuff from this year.
---
Also the increasingly inaccurate pictures they use on the Atomic Shop updates themselves.  I mean, [look at this one](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4AEzdUwIWYvgqzIFmAZLqK/ab4f907182d8432a74668cb15121ed76/76_ATX_Week59Items_1920x1067.jpg).  The individual boxed presents were never a thing.  The holiday tree centerpiece isn't even available.  You can't run those lights diagonally, to my knowledge.  Was there even a holiday-themed sleeping bag?  I don't remember one.
---
I don't know.  It reeks of a marketing guru taking something that should have been really straightforward ("Hey, here are some Christmas goodies to decorate your CAMP, buy what you want til Christmas") and trying to wring every last dollar from it with every artificial scarcity tactic in the book, even when it doesn't make any bloody sense, seeing as Christmas has a natural deadline.
---
Oh well.  At least the best stuff wasn't even Atomic Shop, imo.  The Icicle Lights are awesome and so is the Snowflake Metal Armor.
---
Merry Christmas, happiest of other holidays, and a beautiful life to all of you.
---
Enjoy this time to be with your loved ones both IRL and online.  Blast some scorched for me.
---
Well played!
---
That’s actually really good, two keeper in 1000 scrips, wow. I’d be lucky if I get one keeper out of 5000 🤮
---
Even dragon age to an extent was led down a similar path. Pressure from higher up to deliver that same Origins magic way faster and we got polarizing 2 and the similarly polarizing (but imo slightly better) Inquisition. Then Mass Effect peaked at 2 then just went down and down. Honestly 1 and 2 were such tight well told stories, down to the individual beats they follow, that anything following it would need to try way harder or just abandon Shepard and start a new story. They kind of tried both and failed both times imo. 3 was a rehash of 2 with a lazy reskin of the “stakes” and “story.” Andromeda was just a god damn mess from the start. Unlikeable characters, no depth or point to anything, very empty and unfulfilling. 
---
I really hope I get to see Bioware return to form soon. I honestly can’t think of any games I love as much as dragon age 1, mass effect 2, and new vegas and some others but that’s irrelevant.
---
Either way! You can just click on my Reddit profile and start a chat if you're on line, or just search for my in-game name which is kepharel and send a friend request and I'll add you 👍
---
Pretty sure the 3rd picture answers that exact question, weeeeeeeeee!
---
A few days a year counts!
---
Merry Christmas you brilliant bastard. Wonderful post.
---
Thanks for the heads up, it's partially in response to what the hackers are trying to do to destroy another wise Trouble game, but fun community that I'm doing this. I'm not going to let a few bad apples scare me
---
All I wanted was santa outfit, and I got it so I am happy!
---
Lol great adaptation, my only flaw was that you holstered your gun then killed the scorched
---
Nice, definitely want to get the excavator paint ..
---
IO will take it!
---
Not a problem if you just turn down all voice chats. I’m sure people try and talk to me sometimes but I never know.
---
You are so right.. but also you can say the best stuff wasn’t even atomic shop.. which is true.. but just imagine how much better them few camp rewards (and how many more there easily could’ve been) if the atomic shop wasn’t such a clear mess and sham to rinse us of every last penny..
---
Too add to your point.. noticeably is the absence of the bundles this year.. now instead of you want every Christmas item in the atomic shop your forking over well over £50..
---
r/sadcringe
---
Cool, def think I am going to grab it .. been rocking the bloody raider paint for so long .. this will be a nice change ..
---
Sure, add me and come meet me, i'll give ya it :)
---
I am a mega Fallout fan... This game ain't a true Fallout... This ain't it chief
---
That's crazy.
---
Yeah looks cool and that dam snowflake suit everyone's been wanting is there also
---
Merry Christmas fellow Vault dwellers!
---
What's your IGN? Bethesda's doing that thing where it shows the friend request name for 2 seconds then dissapears.. need to add you on my side :/
---
I thought he was named after that actor in the Star Wars movies with the horrible accent at first, but he's Boydega or something.  I refused to watch Pacific Rim Uprising after hearing him speak in the trailers (which was probably a good idea anyhow since apparently it's terrible).
---
My bloodied explosive 50 cals name is aunt flow
---
I've never heard of [Gamstat.com](https://Gamstat.com) before, I always used the [PlayerCounter.com](https://PlayerCounter.com) since they supposedly track "Active Playing Players".  Which one is more trustworthy?
---
Friend request sent, thanks!
---
Well the common sense move from day 1 has been to play a different game
---
Tried adding you twice, might be that Social bug...  my IGN is Coxinga, try adding me?
---
And I agree wholeheartedly. There will always be the ones who buy the Fallout 1st subs, the other games, and will remain complacent. 
---
It's just a damn sight irritating, because they'll be the first to complain if something goes wrong, and like you said, the cycle begins anew.
---
Yea I kinda need to hear my teammates &amp; they hear me. If its just that one person with a Mic then I just turn it off.
---
Got it, had to relog.. hate social menu sometimes lol
---
Dumb
---
I’ll have to edit that , coffee wasn’t the greatest this morning 🤣
---
I like to say I'm "juicing" and the put the microphone up the glass as I  poor orange juice into it. Then I make sure to audibly drink it with big gulps followed by a large "Aaaaahhhh" and a lip smack. It is important for me to let others know I am "cool" and drink juice.
---
Is this a real challenge? :0
---
It would, yes, but the scale of issue is so small, unless you are Judge Dredd no one really minds.
---
I think I marked up some flux to a higher percentage and it sold, no shock, next time I'll try higher.  I was only dumping about 6 or 7 units that were surplus to that "20 per color" I had set for myself, so no big loss.
---
If you go east of dent and son construction to the farmhouse there are always albino radstags there
---
And Grushnak is a Gru that likes Shnacks
---
I'm on PS4 too, but I'm currently away from home for the holiday. My PSN is Blue_Dabadi, if you send me a friend request and let me know you're from Reddit, I can get you one free of charge. I'll be back this Saturday if you can wait that long.
---
Or switch weapons back and forth quickly which is sometimes easier. Either way it's a pain.
---
Thank you ever so much!   The extra gifts were really icing on the cake!   Happy Holidays to you!
---
Thanks for all the tips.  
---
I don’t really use any aid outside of rad in nuke zones.  My vampire weapons fill me up.  I’m sitting on hundreds of stims.  I don’t really understand the other aids or when to use them, so I’ve been stock piling those as well.
---
I actually came back when I heard about Fallout 1st a few weeks ago.  The idea of a “private” server sounded great (though I found the community to be really nice now so I’m usually in public).  Then factoring in the scrap box, tent and discounted atoms it felt like a no brainer. 
---
As someone who loves scavenging and adventuring it feels weird not grabbing pretty much everything.  
---
My biggest issue is that I love trading and the player vendors.  I want to sell everything but it takes up stash space so quickly.
---
Naturally :)
---
You're welcome, had that 10mm sitting there for god knows how long lol, wonder if pistol builds are even a thing lmao  
---
And Happy Holidays to you too :)
---
not yet, and none of the free states armor skins have been released yet
---
So- in one shot it looks like the Giant Letters light up- but in the others it doesn't.
---
Does anyone know if they light up?
---
Also: goddamn Mr. Fuzzy in gold.
---
Don't think so.  Around here a Bodega is a corner store or convenience store.  Doubt it has much meaning to him
---
The “compensation” is going to be 500 atoms
---
Perfect!
---
😂❤️
---
I bet she's a real.... BLAST
---
I’m new to fallout 76 and despite the hate I really love it and everyone is super friendly :)
---
personally i like to use my coffee grinder when im playing
---
Good choice. The white and black tuxedos are boss, as well as the confetti pose for photomode. It gives a continuous stream of confetti and plays a little kazoo-y noise with clapping. 
---
I need a ton of people to get it this pose so we can throw a big ol' party in the NW waiting room.
---
there’s a blue one that you already have that’s way better. As well as that nuka-cola rocket one.
---
God jul to you all!
---
Hey props to you man. I don't use frog legs either. 
---
But you gotta remember context matters.  Melee user are essentially assassins.  What do assassins do in games?  Nuke the every loving hell out of you from stealth. Their weakness is being a glass canon as well as the limitations of stealth and the range of their attacks.  
---
Realistically a sniper can just as easily obtain the instant kill if they simply are good enough to score that precious headshot. With the safety of being extreme range too. 
---
The only times one hit kills are bullshit is in regards to the rest of the games TTK or time to kill. In nuclear winter the average TTK is just one second sustained fire with a meta build.  And that's with body shots.  It's half that with headshots.  So between a one shot kill which is a TTK of 0 vs a skilled meta user whos TKK is .5 the difference in TTK is basically negligible. But one is incredibly restricted in range and incredibly risky. The other is safe and more versatile among all ranges. 
---
This isn't like Halo that has a lengthy TTK where oneshots are seriously powerful.  Here whether its melee, combat shotgun, or handmade, blink and you will miss it.  So why even bother using the  ones with less reliability and more restrictions? 
---
And that my friend is precisely why you have the commando frogleg meta.
---
Merry Crisis to the Fallout community
---
Krampus shall not get us today!
---
What responder bunker gear clothing?
---
I mean there is the angry emote but I'd love a middle finger emote lol
---
Oh yes - I am hoping they're going to officially release the gold sequined dress for new years. Definitely going to grab it if I can and try for that pose too. I see it from time to time and always wish I had it.
---
I love the level of detail, it’s very immersive to me, just when I think I’ve turned over every stone in the forest, I go looking for scorched at the amusement park and just keep finding little things I didn’t know about!
---
Yes.  I love my tent but I don't want my tent blocking someone's camp.
---
And vice versa
---
The word 'Gold' was a major selling point for me
---
That's the 7k XP item. 14k XP is a jacket.
---
All Christmas tree are radioactive haahaahaa. But serious can't believe they couldn't give us at least the tree already in game.
---
its just an awfull game ... for you. for myself and a lot of people all over the servers its great. good luck in finding a new game.
---
I can run and launch one with you if you want
---
Merry Christmas my brothers from other mothers. (And sisters from..... other Mr’s). That’s the best I got friends!
---
Absolutely. The people who got their inventories hacked were saying the same thing when I was trying to warn them about that hack, too.
---
[Goldmember would definitely buy this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-COG4YTn6M).
---
A lot of people are saying "I think" and "I believe" which is as good as saying "I don't know." I can say for a fact it is still broken as my bloodied rifle with 250 damage reduction makes it not bloodied after reloading
---
Merry Christmas y’all!
---
Oh... Okay. Any pictures on here of it?
---
Merry christmas or whatever else ppl celebrate see you in the wasteland!
---
I collected myself a nice Bloodied 50% Limb 1Agi Handmade a few minutes ago. I did a little happy dance and now I’m enjoying the damage bonus. This event is rather beneficial for me personally.
---
I think everyone deserves private worlds I paid 60$ for this game and dont plan on giving them another 100$ to have my own server I'd even run it off of my own hardware
---
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year to you to. That is one snazzy controller 😊
---
I would totally wear this IRL.
---
The presents from Nuclear Winter are great, and so easy to get. Two matches is all that it took. I got the 3rd reward, the "Charlie Brown" tree, and it's neat too. Nuclear Winter/Event decor /&gt; Atomic Shop decor.
---
If it has its axle or a metal backside, that would  be even cooler.
---
Sure, but I won’t. Be on for an hour
---
It was irritating me as well. I can't let it effect me as its just a game from a game company who'd rather scotch tape their game together.
---
I fought myself from making snide comments on the Hot page of this subreddit. Seeing someone praise Bethesda for the event challenges, and seeing it upvoted.
---
Its a no win situation. You and I could stop playing it. But millions of others will continue. 
---
I'll stop for a while. It feels perverse to play it now. Knowing that something else, something probably worse is over the horizon.
---
Like people being able to buy shit from your shops for a single cap. That should be fun.
---
Always the top floor of the house just behind the fire station at White springs... Where the Halloween even was.
---
Game is dead
---
I'm not trying to dissuade anyone. As I have noted twice already, I was directly responding to the OP's question regarding downvotes, by explaining why someone might downvote the thread. It has no evidence so it does constitute a rumour by this reddit's very rules. 
---
I've seen more than one person making claims about new hacks (like the 'delete all your characters hack is coming' rumour currently going around as well), so with no offense meant to the OP, I think it's worth pointing out that lack of evidence hurts the claim. If you just believe every warning then it becomes easy for trolls to mess with this community by inserting false narratives.
---
However, each person can make their own decision concerning how to respond to the post. I didn't downvote or upvote the OP, I don't think they're a troll, but I'm not going to change my vending habits or take the warning as a fact, either.
---
This should get bumped.. so tired of moving..
---
Keep an eye out for Kellogg Claus who may pay your camp a visit and drop off Sugar Bombs. I started doing it last year and had some fun. Shame we don't have eggnog, but leaving out a plate of Fancy Lad Snack Cakes and either a Nuka Cola or Purified Water is fine by me. Probably will be trying to also drop off some gifts plundered from our friendly neighborhood scorched.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Kinda want the big letters and backpack but I already have too many holiday items I'm gonna have to take down after winter :o 
---
If I used a mole gauntlet I'd be excited
---
As someone who has watched eagerly from the sidelines as a big fallout fan but refused to purchase fo76 because of the plethora of warnings and issues from before the game launched, this post brings me a kind of sad joy.
---
I glue my microphone to my vape so everyone I play with knows Im vaping, I mean it doesnt count if other people dont knowm
---
Hum , yeah maybe it what happened to me too , totally forgot to check the fridge after put mentat back in my stash.  
---
Will try for see, thx for sharing.
---
You mean the one that's a big tire, right? It was part of the raider bundles from a while back. There were two versions, one had "Die Vault Scum" engraved on the hubcap and the other one didn't. I'm sure it'll come back at some point but when that happens is anyone's guess.
---
My B/FFR/-25VATS The Fixer is aptly named "The Buster"
---
[It was datamined](https://i.imgur.com/XdSTFIh.png) a while back [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/f4h7gjo) along with [Responder PA](https://i.imgur.com/4b94jpx.png)
---
I'd also like to point out regarding your 'target pool' remark... if someone makes this hack they're not going to need to come to reddit nuancing posts and debating people. There will be plenty of unaware players in the game, as reddit users are a minority of the playerbase.
---
Really? Well FUCK! I’ll try to get on fallout atomic store at least every week.
---
I imagine it is coming with Wastelanders. In the teaser photos there are a lot of raiders wearing armor made of tires.
---
I bought the game for $12 and it's been worth every penny. I'd be fucking heated if I had paid $60 for this, though.
---
I paid for NMS in full and remember that frustration. I'm gonna try it out again with all the updates one of these days but I'm still salty lol.
---
Ok cool.
---
Merry Christmas, fellow Wastelanders and Vault Dwellers.
---
Update:
---
They also have baby balls.
---
True fallout fans don't support broken games
---
Lots of people are spending tens or even hundreds of thousands of caps on crafting large handmade gifts, which have the best chance at rare plans.
---
I’ve got loads but I’m crafting hundreds of gifts a day. Hardly had anything good from the ones I’ve got off scorched.
---
I've had the most luck buying the large wrapping paper and making gifts and opening them. Most of the rare plans I've gotten came from gifts I made myself. If you use the chemist perk card while crafting them it doubles the gift. I've spent over 100k caps on wrapping paper since the event started.
---
Lol you’re ridiculous.
---
Are you really trying to claim that there isn’t a strong cause for not playing this game and playing other games instead?
---
You’re lost. The micro-transactions, the blatant lies (16x the detail, only cosmetics), the lack of content comparative to similarly priced MMOs, the consistent trend of hacking and exploiting, the lore breaking elements of the game, the delays, i might as well stop here because i know you will tune out
---
You bought a faulty product and you’re trying to justify it because you don’t want to accept that you made a mistake. You are trying to convince yourself that others are unreasonable.
---
I love/hate this sub because Well I find out important things I’m a little level I don’t know all the details and I don’t want to story spoiled but could you tell me how you craft gifts do you mean with a collector on?
---
This sounds breakable. Like removing a blueprinted item and it somehow recreating it
---
Lol, excellent tho 👍
---
How can you craft hundreds a day? That's hundreds of thousands of caps
---
“Hacker, no hacking! Hacker, no hacking! Hacker, no hack— oh no! We didn’t say it fast enough!”
---
Never thought of that, if you're right you've just saved me a shit ton of work, thank you
---
I just don't know how people have 100k caps and then some.
---
Griefers, hackers, Reddit vitriol, Youtube wailers, I love the game because it's fun. Simple as that.
---
Making a better safer game would reduce future cheats let's be honest
---
No you buy the wrapping paper from a vendor robot, use the chemist perk and open them. Much better chances of rare plans.
---
Sometimes there’s an encounter where you can find about 30 radstags and 3 Yao Guai
---
I had max caps on 4 accounts and I’ve been selling everything I own. Sold a lot of backpack mods for 25k each.
---
It's a cumulative total over several days from selling to vendors and making sales from my vending machines. Once I get around 20k caps I go buy some wrapping paper.
---
Ok, but well, having an archaic engine from 2002 as a base doesnt help much either.
---
Oh, I just looked at the backpack and it looks like they decided not to Putin the wheel part of the tire so it’s just rubber. Unless it’s just hard to see but that’s kinda lame.
---
Multiple characters, each can hold 30k at max capd
---
I am late to the fallout game, I never knew nuka-cola one existed. Sounds cool!
---
To be fair it's the only way this otherwise empty game gets interest to the mainstream
---
You can also use any items you unlock in Nuclear Winter with any of your characters.
---
Im talking about radstags my dude.
---
OK I saw that vendor bought and I was like what the hell is wrapping paper low-quality high-quality I didn’t buy it now I forget where I saw it...?
---
If you're a 1st sub. Take as many workshops as you can on a private server, place a holiday collectron, and complete the initial defend event to get the fast travel target. Then let the workshop get overtaken as you go around taking other workshops. You'll still have the travel target and the collectron wont quit working.
---
Thankyou
---
Yes, and? That doesnt change what Betheada is doing. They have acknowledged a problem without doing anything about it multiple times. They keep leaving their players in the dark. They have banned people doing their best to HELP this game.
---
I'm not upset that a game has glitches. I'm just disappointed in how they are handling them and their lack of communication. Sick of the lies and then let downs
---
Your responses sound really insecure.
---
I can understand though, putting that much of your life into something and having someone attack it must feel like a personal attack to you.
---
It’s okay.
---
I'm talking about radstags.
---
It depends of the country. In many countries the parents can't be sued because of their children, a fact...
---
If you have five alts and you max out daily sales to bots, you can get 7k per day, two weeks can land you 100k just from selling to bots. Then if you have highly sought after items such as legendary weapons and armors, you can make a bunch of caps very quickly.
---
Can't wait to see the next exploit announced in 48 hours.
---
Every faction vendor is selling, in the railway stations etc.
---
Besides kill XP after we die, we really need to get time played XP after we die when our team is still alive. Really sucks missing out on that first place XP when you were literally in the final fight. 
---
Every other BR does this because it makes Sense. And before you come in with saying people will abuse it by being afk, just add an afk timer along with it.
---
I play almost exclusively on private servers now because of all the hacking and asshat action.  I don't want to have to guess if the guy inviting to team is going to gank me and take my junk with his buddies.  I don't need someone taking my god weapons I had to grind WestTek for a year to have drop naturally.  I'm pretty much playing FO4 in Appalachia with friends.  I actually like playing with the general public,  but BGS has made that too risky. Shame because there are 98% nice people with some total douches ruining it for everyone.
---
Just go to whitespring hotel. All faction vendor bots are there. You can hit up all 5 at once, sever hop and repeat. Just depends on how many caps you want to spend. Good luck.
---
yeah, I was gonna say, blaming the devs is kinda stupid.
---
Blame Todd Howard
---
All of the vendor bots (I think) have it. Whitespring station bot has x2 for sale. If you can boost your charisma then the lowest you can buy the high quality is 1400c. That’s where I’ve found the majority of my rare plans. Good luck!
---
Bullshit.  You obviously don't even know what a troll is.  A troll deliberately says or does something to make another person pissed off.  Now if you think me telling the truth or me having a different opinion makes me a troll, then that sums up how stupid you and your argument against me is.  There is a clear difference but you are too silly to realise.
---
It's just easier to call me a troll isn't it mate, rather than actually acknowledge Fallout 76's flaws. You and your mates just sit there and take whatever junk these developers and publishers sell you.
---
You've thrown around just as many insults and insinuations mate, so I don't know who you're hoping to impress by hanging those allegations on me.
---
And using assets from a bake sale they had four years ago
---
Exactly! 
---
I don't see weft,  at Xmas, EVERYTHING isn't in there and on sale.
---
It's in the misc. section. The high quality wrap makes the large gifts. Don't forget to equip the chemist perk at the tinkerer bench for 2x gifts per wrap.
---
What did you lose Lord? I've got tons of weapons and armor I don't really use and sell for caps that I don't really need...
---
Next to white springs golf course
---
Kudos to you sir!
---
Well, damn. I've only got time for 2 characters and I feel I play quite a bit lol
---
Dont lump obsidian in with bethesda. Obsidian bumps usually come from passion and over ambition. Bethesda cant have said the same for several years
---
But why do you think Bethesda would waste the money on a lawsuit? They wouldn't gain anything, it would probably be bad press (considering the game had been cracked open since day one) and it would cost them money. And unless they patched the game from Hell and back it would still be exploited the next month
---
How much time investment is this? I'm not going to do it,  I'm just curious.
---
What are you selling?
---
well we can all agree he's all stupid.
---
I usually have music playing in my mic haha
---
ive just recently completed all the taxidermy heads that are findable in the gifts, including the frog and mothman.. just missing the SBQ, Mirelurk queen, and Scorch Beast
---
I spend 270k Caps on wrapping paper. Cause it felt like a good use for them. I sell gifts cheap in my Vendors and give away duplicate Plans to collectors. Nothing else to really spend Caps on these days. It was a decent Cap sink.
---
Curious to know if you are part of that very vocal 1/4 i mentioned...
---
But ok, call me names. Btw i have never thought buying this game was a mistake, despite all the controversy and bugs which speaks volumes about the fun gameplay.
---
But you apparently decided im trying to justify my purchase. Cool to assume, you do you and enjoy your life.
---
Also, is this a burner account you are using? Your post history isnt really showing any Fo76 postings ever then now. 1/4 perhaps?
---
Love it 🎄🎁
---
FO76 subreddit is pretty bipolar- on one hand you have hardcore fallout fans who defend the game to the grave, on other you have hardcore haters who would see the game go up in flames even if it killed them, and on the third mutated hand you have critics and 'normal' players getting smacked by both extremes when they do something that doesn't fall entirely on one camp.
---
You can purchase wrapping paper from any robot vendor and craft handmade holiday gifts at a tinker's workbench.  If you put the Chemist perk on you can make double the gifts.
---
Merry Christmas fellow wastelander
---
A 5* would do nicely for a Christmas gift haha
---
Makes the grind worth it, yeah?
---
I got the snallygaster, and all of the common animals, but haven't found literally anything else. I haven't even had a large gift drop in the wild!
---
My Fixer is named Maximizing Alphaness and my lever gun is You Did This Richard.  I have a power fist named Cunty on a different character.  It’s not as rude as it seems if you’re familiar with the show I’m clearly a big fan of.
---
I am a Fallout 1st member for this month. Try again, buddy.
---
I wanna get on but I'm at work!!! Wait till I'm off lol jk
---
Great game imo. If you’re stupid enough to to listen to a pile of you tubers who rely on income by creating sensationalist click bait videos well then I wouldn’t recommend this title for you. You obviously want something novel like a fidget spinner or a rubix cube. 
---
My advice: go against the curve. Switch off you tube and make your own opinions brother. There’s a whole wide world out there and the likes of juice head are only interested in the tiny portion of that world that translates into a click from you into cash in his wallet.
---
Certainly does
---
Charleston Capital Building has one and the demolished apartment building in Charleston in the SE corner also has one.  FO4 had one.  It clearly is an item in the game, and for some reason they won't give it as a CAMP item .... just crappy Santa Crashes and Charlie Brown trees.  Nothing positive.  Always death and destruction, and stuff that appeals to children and the immature.
---
Ho ho ho Merry Christmas and a ...loading...happy new year!
---
I've got a stash full of drwr weapons waiting for the fix that doesn't break everything else in the world.  BGS needs some serious talent working on this game to make it non-alpha at this stage.  They regressed from Beta to Alpha with this last patch and hack events.
---
Noticed how “gaming news “ sites will break news over a stupid bag but not how thousand of players that invested their time and money in this pile of shite ( me included ) got hacked.
---
No kotaku , no pc gamer stealing the whole note from a red it post ;) I bet you anything they handed money to suppress the news
---
I'll get back on for you when you get out
---
True
---
I don’t play the other characters, they’re all level 2. Just somewhere to store my caps.
---
I'd like a way to actually respec your character. The moving one point at a time thing is tedious
---
Which sucks.  I don't like NW, no matter how much Bethesda wants to focus on it and sell it above all else.
---
This.   If we're could only put ASAMs in our bases. 
---
Missile turrets aren't enough.
---
So your telling me there is absolutely nothing wrong with the game at all
---
Also the first half is completely unwarranted as if you read my post i already said i put about 100 hours or so into it, but couldnt get back into it on pc as it was full of so many bugs it was unreal
---
My question was wether or not anything has improved and become stable
---
So YouTubers aside (as many give fair debatable points to their arguments, angry joe for one), would you say the game has improved enough for me to buy it a second time
---
Also how is the community fkr the game as pc was dead for me for a while
---
I don't like this idea. The limitations in place now prevent people from stacking too many cards. For example, people could run around with Bloody Mess, Tenderizer, Suppressor, Adrenaline, etc. Crossing the 15 point special limitations isn't a good idea. If they kept that in place for balance, I'd be OK with that.
---
Upvote for visibility.
---
I love the fallout world and it’s bothersome that the company goes and rips people’s wallets off just for the sake of profit , the major thing the game had going on was sell sell sell atoms ...
---
Merry Christmas, wastelanders! May your water purifiers always be full and your legendaries always max stars.
---
&gt;ook up the definition of "few"
---
few
---
 adjective
---
Definition of few (Entry 2 of 3)
---
1: consisting of or amounting to only a small numberone of our few pleasures
---
2: at least some but indeterminately small in number—used with acaught a few fish
---
few and far between
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/few
---
So everything I said was correct.
---
Beautiful post. The community makes this game what it is. When you strip back everything, all that remains is the love for Fallout. Merry Christmas Wastelander! ♥️
---
You say something like this,  you gotta say your source or link.
---
No. There’s currently a hack (at least on pc) allowing people to take your entire inventory. It is unaddressed while Bethesda is on vacation. That alone should show the game has not improved.
---
I'm an idiot.
---
 I figured the challenge was for glowing radstag from the way op worded it.
---
Oh yea, I'd probably include that as part of character progression. 
---
I personally like the one point thing because it's a motivation for me to keep leveling, BUT, I know it's also super tedious for other players. It could be cool if there was a repeatable legacy quest you can complete at level 50+ that gives you a full respec, but has a timer. That way I can just ignore it and folks like yourself and can save the headache. xD
---
Thanks for the honesty, due to uni i havent kept up with the past month or so of news for the game
---
Do you know if there are any other glaring issues, especially for pc and xbox?
---
I don't like it either. I've only played twice: once the day they released the new map and had limited time VTU stuff and once a few days ago to get the first 3 Christmas things. I don't care for weapon or armor paint, since I use the Fixer and that can't be painted and I always cover my armor.
---
Engines are a whole product in and of themselves. Mindblowing right?
---
In the atom shop.  Santatron.
---
I wonder if the person who was supposed to stock the Atom Shop was one of the people who got called in to fix the hacking debacle.
---
Yeah, i think that'd be great. Something optional if you want to do it that way or just keep going through the game normally if you prefer it how it is now or just don't want to change anything
---
Merry Christmas and I hope you have a nice holiday for the people who don’t celebrate Christmas. God bless
---
I do wodner if they use git or any sane source control
---
Haha nevermind thought the challenge was for glowing radstag by the way op worded it.
---
I have been hearing more bong hits than anything haha
---
Think so, either way I'm happy
---
Yea if there's music I turn my Mic off. especially hip-hop. That team member will be getting zero help from me. lol
---
I mean there’s the usual. They’ve addressed most like reloading breaking all armor. I think they actually have managed to address the inventory stealing exploit. However I don’t know about the one where hackers spawn in fallout four assets and broken fifteen effect legendaries I think it’s still active. I’m not terribly up to date as most my news does come from YouTube and they don’t always report fixes right away.
---
X-01 power armour.  Furious explosive gatling and all the heavy perks like stabilized,  one gun army,  etc.
---
Lotta stoners love some Nuclear Winter. lol
---
A close friend that plays with hackers regularly, he forwarded me a text but I sent part of it to the mods. It could not happen but I want people to play with caution.
---
You just made my day
---
LOL, I ironically named my LMG “fascist might”.
---
This is me.   Im going to spend xmas collecting and modding gatlings (plasma, laser, etc.) , lmg, etc.  I find heavy a fun build.
---
I haven’t heard anything still waiting for a response to the ticket I placed to them
---
I just don’t understand smoking inside, doesn’t that just ruin all your belongings?  Not to mention your poor console!
---
Jesus that sounds rough, and i guess that means that fallout 76 really was just a poorly ported fallout 4 copy
---
Its a shame the game hasnt improved much then, as i saw it on sale on my Xbox and thought it might be worth it, thanks for the honest info, just helped me avoid wasting money, time to check for a better game (i have already played outerworlds so that ones off the table)
---
Same, but the leaked Communist stuff since I got the suit pack and flapper dress last year before they left.
---
You too!
---
Have a eggnog nukashine on me.
---
You mean sitting there with your phone accepting requests to change inventory?
---
Nuka Egg nog shine!
---
Yeah but don’t say that in this sub or you’ll be sentenced to downvote hell. And yeah it really hasn’t and it’s kinda sad. I’ve also put in about 100hours on pc but it just never improved so I finally was done. I’d recommend disco Elysium I hear nothing but good things about it.
---
&gt;Lets just get this out of the way: WoW? Let this game age 15 years and then we can come back.
---
Dosen't matter. WoW had a colossal fuck up at launch. And a colossal fuck up is a colossal fuck up is a colossal fuck up.   Unless you are being a disingenuous cherry picking shit head it all applies equally. 
---
&gt;Never played em.
---
Then you are speaking from the realm of ignorance.  Fucked up launches are not new. Just look at New Vegas. That game was and still is without mods a cluster fuck beyond even standard issues Bethesda games have.
---
&gt;They doubled down on the promise that in game purchases were cosmetic only 
---
Yea the game director and head of PR/HR doubled down on it. Unfortunately they are not the God Emperor of Bethesda and can be over ruled.
---
&gt;promise by launching fallout first (
---
First and atomic shop are two different arguments. 
---
&gt;Lastly: PR is not the same as the face of a company. 
---
Yes it is. If you do not think so then you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Yeah, looks really slick.
---
76 is set in America, if you’re playing you’re celebrating.   Ta hell with the red menace, commies, and atheists.
---
I have int and strength at max for power armour and heavy weapon perks.
---
It’s already Christmas for me. SUCC
---
Colonel Kelley Monument
---
I've seen like a dozen there both with and without yao guai
---
You know, everyone who says 'I rEpOrTeD iT wHy DiDnT yOu FiX iT?' Think about how much is reported to them, it's most likely an automated response system or someone who can't desiminate truth about coding from fiction. And the VOLUME people send in.
---
Yea it's definitely a stinky habit.
---
And where do I deny it's flaws? Again, where do I advocate for it?
---
The only insult and insinuation I made was that you are an unpaid troll, yet you continue to claim I've made certain statements that I haven't.
---
Nothing I have said is untrue.
---
You came here to get flamed obviously, and you can't take the fact I'm just calling you what you are. 
---
You're a novice.
---
Colonel Gutsy's pretty much destroy everything in this game, including SB's.  It's fun to sometimes watch a patrol of them wander into the SBQ/fissue area.
---
Haha, i still find it funny people care about downvotes, seems stupid as ive never seen the actual effects of it or karma
---
Never heard of disco elysium, currently about to try sinking city and we happy few so hopefully ill clear those up and ill give Elysium a try
---
You tried remnant from the ashes at all?
---
If your on Xbox you should stop by my north pole and get a gift gamertag Bob3rino
---
No, it's a legendary weapon.
---
You would either have to have one drop from a legendary mob, trade for one, or find one in a player's vending machine.
---
The bloodied effect is legendary effect so you have to get it by chance
---
I got mobbed by the flat woods monster accompanied by a graft on monster and many feral ghouls all glowing purple because of the flat woods monster. The battle took almost five minutes......this is why I play.
---
Bloodied is a Legendary effects and it only drops on weapons that come from the purveyor or legendary enemies. Then u have the rng of the effects and weapon so it's hard to get what u want.
---
Fuck yea
---
Jingle balls you might say
---
Do you have a link by chance to the communist stuff? I've heard they got leaked but never found a link.
---
You should have KNOWN about this when news of it first broke. You should have shut down the servers to look into it when news first broke. But instead you waited for the hack to go live and affect hundreds of people. If I was still one of your customers, I would leave you behind now. This is inexcusable and wrong.
---
^this!!! I hate going back every day for a whole week only to see the same 2 wallpapers and skin on sale. Please change it to a daily cycle or something! 🙏
---
Those armor piercing rounds will ruin your day
---
That's exactly what a hacker would say!
---
Oh man I gotta start vaping now.
---
Im on PC and have rarely had any problems.  A couple disconnects sure, but nothing game breaking.  This game is amazing!
---
Please be my friend.
---
Don't have much scrip, but going to do some grinding and then make a few purchases. Hoping for a decent 50 cal so I can start using heavy weapons.
---
This has been the case way before the hack became available. I've always found it difficult trying to give away free stuff to lower level players. More often than not I just dump it on the floor and leave.
---
What’s my reward? Oh wait! Recipe for cranberry relish, LOL!!!
---
Absolutely amazing, would love a tutorial!
---
Instead of writing all these pretentious comments, trying to demonstrate your intellectual superiority, you could have just taken a few seconds to Google this very widely distributed and easily obtainable script.
---
I'm looking forward to your future posts, whining about your vendors getting wiped and blaming some 13 year old script kiddies for ruining your gameplay rather than the corporation that refuses to address its enormous security flaws.
---
Merry Christmas you filthy animals of the wasteland :D
---
Www.nukacrypt.com
---
Awesome thanks man
---
15 would still be the limit, but you could equip up to 15 for each stat, meaning you don't need to re-assign special to be able to switch builds in PvP
---
I think the whole point was too let Bethesda know they were going to do it to prove they could
---
Didnt you find it kind of lackluster at all, the lack of npcs (something ive heard they plan on fixing but got delayed) bothered me a fair amount, the overall promise of high end graphics and content that just wasnt in the game both at launch and post launch felt like a slap in the face to me personally
---
What content would you say stood out to you as something that was worth playing it, as i got all the way to around level 80 or so with two characters and i couldn't find anything without the game kicking me out (i have top end internet btw), enemies becoming immortal, quests becoming impossible to hand in as the progress kept resetting and very hard to play solo without someone 10x your level forcing the areas enemies to scale to them
---
Sorry if thats kind of a rant, but anything that stood out to you as a good thing would be nice to hear, as discussion is healthy and isn't the usual loyalist Bethesda are god tier content creators and the best studio or this is an amazing AAA title type of nonsense
---
Oh no I want that little liberator icon so bad!! Thank you for sharing. I can't wait to see this stuff in game too. Also do you know if that roman outfit is atom shop or is it NW? I know I've seen it in game just don't remember seeing how to get it. You know what else would be neat - if they turned a liberator into a "loot bag" like a folded up liberator?
---
But if they didn't tell anyone, how would they get all of that attention that they crave?
---
I mean, sure, they've always known how small their own weiner was but now *everyone* knows
---
Ah thank you! I hope to nab it later then!
---
Got that, cant attach raider power armor mods to raider power armor.
---
Wahhhh boo hoo....
---
I get what you mean, im the type of person who gives a game 3 chances, first one is on launch for the first 2-3 months
---
Second is after about 3-4 more months of leaving the game be
---
The third is usually a year or two after launch to see the current state of the game
---
When the game worked it was resonably fun to play, but most of the time it just wasnt playable and i have a powerful rig, so faults with Bethesda for that one
---
And whilst i agree the game got a lot of shit online, especially from people jumping on the bandwagon, at least i have given it a fair amount of my time before giving a critique.
---
Bethesda really didnt help themselves with the way they treated the community, outright lied several times, ban hammered players for literally no good reason and every time something went wrong, they pinned it on another branch studio
---
Oh and not to mention i remember finding a video after about a month with someone spending a lot of hours showcasing like a 1000 bugs and issues with the game
---
The whole reason j made this post was to see how the game has progressed as this would be my 2nd chance as its been about 4-5 months since i picked it up last
---
(Sorry that was long)
---
Your response sounds really snarky and mean spirited. 
---
In the second line it seems you try to make it all about a personal failing on my part. 
---
In the third line you tell me its okay. like you are some sort of comforting tough guy all badass and what not. 
---
Don't get too full of yourself cupcake &lt;--- see right there I just implied a thing too . wow look at us being all internet trolly. done talking to you now I got crap to do and I wont let you drag me down into the weeds, welcome to the block list.
---
Check around and you’ll find them. I have a 2* bloodied LMG for sale, along with some other bloodied weapons. Nothing spectacular LIKE BE but they’ll do the job.
---
he's a design director/producer, he doesn't have a single credit as a programmer in literally any game he's worked on
---
I got the claw so that’s wrong not seen SB tho
---
meltdown solo, engineering, about 30 min of work for ~20 ants.  just sit in there until respawns stop
---
and yes it is a major grind, afaik im the only xbox user with it, and there are only a handful of pc users afaik.
---
I've wondered this too if it actually releases new stuff ever
---
There’s also one in Morgantown and Fallout 4 had one right off the bat.
---
May your next cap stash be plentiful, your legendaries be legendary, your food un spoiled and your ammo full.
---
Great post.
---
The ones who just show them for the sake of having it fixed ye. But the guy who stole more than 500 inventories and then show it in YouTube probably didn't want to help Bethesda.
---
I don't play the game but good job to you guys for playing the game you enjoy even if it's not the best
---
no, those will work. but if it is an arm mod (normally) you cannot install it on a leg. the ones that do not specify what model they are for are for the Excavator, its an odd naming issue with that power armor's mods
---
I have both and I kinda like them as they don't have to snap together
---
they do, purple
---
And considering I'm on -4 points, aforementioned abused fanbase are already kissing ass 🤦‍♂️
---
 No the game is cake for many of us. Its a far better game than Fallout 4 and plays better on my machine.
---
 If you need your hand held the game is not for you. As you complained about instances it may not be the kind of game you like.
---
That's awesome
---
We raid with someone else who has the emote. So you aren’t alone on Xbox.
---
While we're on the subject, didn't they say Fallout 1st would offer discounts on atom shop items? I don't think I've seen any so far...
---
Place the vending machine on a door mat so it allows the blueprint with only 2 items
---
Hey I know another Xbox user who has it cause I do the raids with him lol. It’s just so ridiculous.
---
At least you logged in.  I've had total hard freeze regularly after this last patch. This is ON TOP of the drink water and freeze or just random crash to desktop.  BGS is regressing at this point.
---
yassss! im not alone in the pain!
---
See it’s already begun. But I don’t really think there is one lol. And I’ve heard both of those are pretty decent but they’re sitting on my wishlist. Same with remnant. I’ve also heard good things about it though.
---
This is my armour of choice.  I've got a full set already and have all the plans now (except helmet).  I gifted a full set before, but it took forever in-game to find someone who actually wanted it and would appreciate it.  Maybe if more people used voice chat it would be easier to gift things.
---
i happily give them out actually, I just dont like the idea of others taking them rather then me giving them : o
---
 The game is smooth fast and great on my 32" 4k display. Your "powerful rig" may not be. As well I build my machines to play games, and this is my ninth. ;)
---
I can't blame them for not believing you. It's the internet, you're made some pretty bold claims without presenting any evidence to support those claims. It sucks, I'd like to believe you, but people make outlandish false claims all day long, and we really have no idea who each other are.
---
You got the mirelurk claw, not the morelurk **queen** claw. Check your build options.
---
Useful idiot, or he has some kind of master plan beyond human comprehension.  Probably the former.
---
Which is why one of my armour pieces is always a Troubleshooters.  Got to take a 15% edge off that pop canon!
---
Hey,I seen yer post the other day about this,&amp; while I’m tempted too pop over &amp; get “free” shit,part of the grind is one of the many reasons I play...
---
However,that being said,I admire yer spirit &amp; really appreciate the ability to participate In a community wit individuals such as yerself.
---
So just thanks fer bein you,&amp; have a great Holiday!!
---
Stay Blessed
---
They are on record blatantly lying about the shop before. Maybe the 1st subscriptions did not meet their expectations and as such they had to re-evaluate their pricing structure.
---
You can find me on PS4 and PC. If you ever need a party member hit me up.
---
Like my C.A.M.P. Is in the forest.. level 1 everything.. you would think a Yao Gui or Snallygaster could survive.. especially when I’m not even playing 😂
---
I got it for 10$ ,and it's fun .
---
Im not saying i dont like the game, i just dont like how unpolished it is and how unfinished it was prior to launch, i still got a good 100 odd hours out of it and just wanted to know if anything big had been added to warrant retuning
---
Like how stable is pc and xbox, how much "new" content is available now, also whats the whole fallout first thing, i saw it on the store but didnt read into it
---
I do see what you mean with 3rd line, but no, im not some troll as trolls rarely waste the time and money to actually play a game, rather then mash on a keyboard to stir up drama
---
And i tried eve online, i played maybe a week and got bored, as for forcing yourself to enjoy a game, i am about  50/50 on that one
---
In some cases you definitely cant force a game to be enjoyable, but in some cases, like the bioshock franchise, i adored 1 and somewhat infinite, but hated 2 for the most part, forcing myself to enjoy it just to justify purchasing it
---
Guess it's up to the individuals tolerance levels really
---
No it’s the queen claw it’s stupid big, noticed it yesterday 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Merry Christmas valt dwellers, hope all is well in your valt/camp/settlement/courier job
---
Gary.
---
Spoofing your HWID takes literally 10 seconds.
---
They said that, yes, but then later changed their website so it no longer includes the Atom Shop discount part.
---
Bethesda pulled a sneaky on 1st subscribers, but they know that these users are the ones who will never speak out.
---
People downvote most things here it’s a crappy community
---
Canvas bags! ^Not ^actually ^canvas
---
Damn, that Chinese Backpack is nice.
---
I'm up voting you because I feel sorry for you. Bummer man. Hope Bethesda can restore your stuff.
---
Pc
---
Merry christmas from the Belgian wasteland 🎅 !!
---
With how fucking toxic this community is im not surprised you guys get your entire inventories wiped by hackers tbh. well deserved
---
Yeah this is the circlejerkiest thing I’ve ever seen. Calling people heros and painting them in a cool edgy light when all they are doing is playing a video game
---
They do light up and consume light budget.
---
Boooo lol thanks
---
No, all of this is automated/ hidden within the trade process...
---
I love this game mainly because of the building mechanics, which are way better than FO4 or Skyrim.  I love the idea that this game is set in the country and you can build wherever you want.  I dont play online games but since FO76 is online multiplayer i gave it a chance.  Its the only game ive played since it came out, and i used to buy a new game every month.  Im married with kids and i have a time consuming job so i cant play nonstop like a lot of people.  Despite the occasional disconnect i havent had any real problems with the game.  Glitches and bugs dont bother me as i mainly use them to my own advantage.  The only thing that bothers me about this game is people that have multiple accounts and mules and bitch about Bethesda being greedy for implementing FO1st as a premium subscription.  Having mules to hoard a shit ton of weapons, armor and aid is more of a advantage/P2W than a ranger outfit and scrapbox.  The hackers and dupers ruin the game more than the bethesda devs lack of experience.  I cant stand the turds on youtube trashing the game either..  all saying the game was broken from the start... how so?  Worked just fine for me.  Bethesda listens to players concerns and grievances, and fixes things when they can.  Current game players want everything now and for free though.  Remember starting with 400lb weight limit?  Now its doubled.  Now they are doing wastelanders with npcs because thats what people wanted. Still all people do is complain about this, complain about that.  This is a survival game, its suppose to be hard and inconvenient.  I dont know...i just wish that instead of people complaining every day on reddit theyd just go play the linear Outerworlds or some other bullshit game.
---
Ive seen and heard a lot about remnant, seems like the community for it is bi polar as half the time they absolutely adore it, then about a week later, i go to check for updates etc and the comments are just full of complaints, people saying the game is empty, the re roll system sucks etc. etc.
---
Its one of the reasons im asking all of you guys about the progress of fallout 76, as if its improved enough to make it stable and has more content, i would happily replay and buy it on my xbox, however there are a lot of other games, like remnant for instance that i could try as well
---
As google is always just news articles who are paid to review it half the time, figured reddit might be a useful resource
---
Merry Nukesmas (and Christmas) to those who still believe in the game and Bethesda
---
Im at lead deposit n of huntersville so i kind of expect it. Name my pets fluffy, currently fluffy#13 a yao gui has been latest casualty.
---
Oof, the forest and they dying. Would thing that is safest place for them.
---
I live in the toxic valley and I lrgitimately hate RadStags, The Anglers, Deathclaw, Mirelurks. Thats fine, Ive come to live with them. But the 40 goddamn radstag that spawn over the hills and tramp through my camp. Fuck em, I spent 1000 caps on a plan to make artillery just so I could frag those fuckers from the luxury of my house. Fuck Radstags. Fuck them hard!
---
I mean, I still play the game and love it. But yeah, this post is awful
---
Awesome post dude
---
Set up a keypad switch to toggle the power to the vendors.  It may also be a pain, but take any item worth more than a few thousand caps out.  You can also do what a lot of people are doing and drop caps on the high value wrapping paper, and if needed, sell duplicate plans.  Lastly, try buying items that you can easily resell for the same amount of caps, 5.56 ammo, cheap plans, etc.
---
Merry Christmas man, I'll be out in the waste later giving out some gifts maybe
---
ROFL. I get downvoted for saying I like a gun. That's good guys. that's fucking hilarious.
---
This is getting ridiculous, it should not have been a thing from the very beginning.
---
The "real" in game community is waiting patently for FO5. You guys are like people who still play with Yugioh cards.
---
Looking for one of my team. They want it to combine with his mutations, to be able to one shot and sneak
---
It is a new sale every day though. On the New Sale tab at the start of the week an item is on sale, every 24 hours it switches to the next one on that tab.
---
I don’t really keep up with it. Why I haven’t heard a ton. And yeah I would buy just about everything over fallout 76 again. Even on here what response you get depends on the community you’re asking.
---
There's an entire thread on returning,  linked at the top of the sub. Read that.
---
 Merry Nuclear Christmas to you all
---
Why are some plain color walls free and others are 300 aroms?
---
If I had a mic I would totally get it i think, but I feel like it would be less fun. Also bc my parents don’t like it if  I’m talking to people online, would probably get in trouble if they found my Reddit account lmao.
---
I've heard that those 3 are still unobtainable.
---
&gt; We have been actively working toward a solution for this and have a fix that we are currently evaluating for release today. 
---
So was this release already done, did they take servers offline yesterday? I thought they would post an update here.. 
---
Maybe that is where I went wrong.. always thinking what makes sense.. need to start doing the opposite..
---
Love this post.
---
Their smallness really is the surprising part.  The photos make them look large, and they have "Giant" in the name, but one look at them in preview mode shows you that they are actually quite dinky.  They might even be smaller than the blue neon ones.
---
Merry Christmas! And a happy Fasnacht!!
---
 So over the top. Have you tried the Plasma Puker? Its a Plasma Flamer, a pistol in my case, that with a Gamma Cap, mo burn, is just so much fun. I've killed 3 Scorchbeasts with it. Well finished them its range is tiny, about 50'. ;)
---
here here mery christmas to you too, may your wasteland travels be merry hackers and haters be damned.
---
I never encountered a game-breaking bug myself, and I played at launch. That said, I'd wait until Wastelanders comes out to see what you think. There will likely be a free trial again at that time too, so you'd get first hand experience before playing. If not, there will be people playing it on YT.
---
On the other hand, if you can get a really good deal, under $20, then I'd say it's worth it; heck, I paid full price and still think it's been worth it.
---
I have tamed four pets and love the idea, but they don’t live long definitely not worth the grind, points or perks needed. I haven’t been able to keep them alive for more than a couple of hours. Turrets will take shots at them and kill them.
---
I don't have a clue why you're not getting any larges. They're rare, but I get a few from my santa-tron every day, and I get at least a few larges as drops from various runs.
---
How do they get the mutation? As soon as the game starts they jump that high
---
Not gonna lie this made me cry a bit. Merry Christmas friend :)
---
I was actually planning on getting it for pc cause it’s on sale rn lol. Can you explain why the pc version sucks?
---
You can pick what they'll have in them?
---
Yeah, it's frustrating.  I lost Mega Sloths on both of my characters around the same time for some unknown reason.  I never saw their corpses, but they just weren't there one day.
---
The pet system in 76 never ceases to feel like an unsupported thing.  You can have pets, but they don't put any effort into making sure the system is halfway reliable.
---
I used to work as a game dev part time, so i know the system well, it honestly depends on the type of game and how much time the company has to spare
---
Take gears of war 3 there was a lot of bugs for reloading, enemies spawn vectors crashing due to object placement collisions etc. Etc.
---
That took them about a week total to fix as they had to work using a previously unpatched version of the game
---
Now lets look at fallout 76
---
Its a live server based game that has to be taken down for maintenance if any kind, whether that be hotfix or full on update
---
As Bethesda are split into several sub studios, they always have staff to work on issues
---
In fallouts instance, Bethesda by law will always have to have a backup of the last working live version on a test server for any changes they want to make
---
But, lets say the latest hacker issue, Bethesda could have had a solution day one, but that doesnt mean we get it immediately
---
This is because of zenimax, any content Bethesda want to release has to be cleared with them first, the same rule applied to warframe on the Nintendo switch, where the games owner digital extremes had to wait for Nintendo to check and clear the content first, before allowing it to go live
---
So at most, wven if Bethesda have a fix, jts not up to solely them as to when, we, the players will receive it
---
(Sorry that was long as hell)
---
I played nonstop for the first two months after launch and then dropped it because I was tired of the bugs, glitches, disconnects, etc etc.
---
I picked it back up when the Double XP thing started a few weeks ago and I've been having an absolute blast. I've been playing a few hours a day and have only disconnected once. 
---
If you already own the game, hop on and give it a try. It's improved immensely in my opinion.
---
I don’t have turrets at my camp... but I agree it’s a great idea that they need to put some work into.. cause if it can live when I’m offline we have issues 😂
---
I just bought 2 more large papers, made 5 gifts. Got a mounted mole rate, tick, baseball bat plan, and another random weapon. Really just want these mounted heads!! I guess I'll wait till the event is over and just pay someone to make them all for me lol
---
I quit the game this morning. I got so tired of all the negativity... So im going to try something different.... Like outer worlds. 
---
Don't hate on me Its just what im doing right now.
---
Real biting commentary there, bub.
---
Sure ill check it out, by top of the sub do you mean like a pinned post type of thing
---
Ignore nesiro he is full of crap. there are bugs and issues from time to time but overall its stable. I have been playing since beta and put a ton of pride and energy into my roles.
---
chapter 1   [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb) 
---
after the last hack and loss of my primary legendary i adjusted my role. 
---
chapter 2  [https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2](https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2)
---
What I see is a lot of bitching and moaning
---
At least I'll know why I suddenly see several stacks of coal in my miscellaneous tab
---
This is the way.
---
At the moment it seems there’s a bug out where when playing on adventure mode(the only mode next to nuclear winter and paid private server) hackers can walk up to you or see you and take everything in your inventory. While as a low level this may not be too crazy since you may not have much. At higher levels players are pretty much loosing pieces they’ve worked months on getting. I’m sure the bug will be fixed soon but we really don’t know at the moment.
---
My friend had a megasloth that got killed by cave crickets.. so understandable.. I was like why is your sloth making a ton of noise... walk outside his camp and saw it die.. I was like oh it’s dead now 😂 
---
But yeah they need to put some work into it for sure
---
&gt; have now killed the people who sell Signs &amp; Letters plans. 
---
I doubt that.  The new pink letters are relatively pricey.
---
I left right after the TSE nerf for the same reasons,I felt bored. But I came back recently and there are lots to do, but only if you are a completionist. The scout badges will take forever, and there are a few new side quests like the Nukashine one, prosnap camera, and the Sheep sasquatch. You could also build a group to try the raid and get the unique raid armor. Other than that I am occupied on leveling up a lot to get all the Perk cards, a perfectly rolled set of weapons and armor, and learn all of the crafting,cooking, and build recipes. There is actually a lot to do if those things interest you. If you are only interested in story quests though, you will be bored again.
---
Make hard choices.   Concentrate only on what helps your current build.
---
You see sounds? How's that work?
---
Are you on ps4? I could give you some caps to craft them for me when the event is over
---
He just asked if it got better, he never said anything negative
---
It is unknown at this point but Bethesda has said that they are trying to figure out the proper compensation.
---
I do too. Also my Vitamix.
---
I guess they left some stuff out for people to have that *limited edition* feel
---
 As I said for some of us the game is cake. I had my Jenny Jones in a dress way out East at level 22. She is my most seriously angry char. Out there whole towns of level 60+ Muties learned to fear her.
---
 Just tag her and your town was going down. A 40 level difference ain't gonna save your ass. ;)
---
Car or game?
---
That's always an option, plus the plans will be going for sale in camps eventually, I know i'm going to be listing a lot of the rarer ones as I need caps for the next few months.
---
Go to Hemlock Holes. One spawns east of the workshop.
---
Not all heros wear capes. I will definitely hit you up on that.
---
u should look at this guys reddit profile all he does is start crap on pages then removes it haha
---
I used to have a camp next to a spawn point of flatwood monster and mothman
---
Are you XB sharing, only the primary account will get items .. but yeah restart as well
---
do you have a role? my original role was  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb) then I got hacked and wrote chapter 2 and changed my role.  [https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2](https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2)  
---
With all the options available in the game if you cant find a way to have fun with it I don't think I can help you.
---
I totally respect and get where your coming from
---
Honestly i want to love this game, ive been a beta player as well so i know the feeling of wanting a game to do well, also as for that role, just feels like we need the old Commonwealth talon company to hunt down dupers
---
As for originality, not trying to start an argument but in this day and age almost everything is rehashed in some form, its just up to the company behind the game how upfront they want to be about it
---
As fir the parts other games dont do, i can agree with you to the extent that the game offers a lot more freedom then you would expect, but a lot of the content can occasionally draw it away for me, like an infinitely spawning wendigo, but that's a bet hate for another time
---
I will likely start playing the game again, and most likely delete my old saves to start fresh, but like you said, i have no idea how long ill stick around for, if there is a set date for wastelanders, ill stick around until a couple months after that to see how it goes
---
Pretty clever about the tilde
---
Not a bad suggestion. I will be grinding on my days off this week but I am so burnt out from work it seems like a chore to farm scorched.
---
I actually normally ignore the story in Bethesda games and spend the time exploring, clearing random caves/places I find and doing the odd side quest I stumble upon. I've always loved the big open worlds with tons to do, so it sounds like this will interest me. Have there been a lot of re-balances for weapons that you've noticed? I think I only have my TSE and that legendary hammer you get from Mayor for a Day in my stash. All my armor is power armor because I'm a pack rat and need that extra carry weight.
---
I’m just giving stuff away. It won’t actually be in a Christmas present box......
---
I haven’t looked there yet. Thank you!
---
All I want is to do decent end game damage with my bare fist, is it too much to ask?
---
I’ve been crafting and handing out level 5 Heavy Studded Pocketed Leather sets (but with Dense for the Chest instead) and Modded up Hunting Rifles and ammo. 
---
I’ve been enjoying that.
---
Pretty much the same...
---
No one destroyed your computer or forced you to spend 5000 hours on it (or one game) so no, it’s not felony vandalism. I don’t even think you could win a class action against Bethesda for their negligence in the architecture and programming of the game either. You see TOS, you “read” TOS, you accept TOS to play, you’ve signed away any rights you have towards digital items and content. No one broke into your house and smashed or stole your $1200 dollar gaming rig.
---
Well the problem with that bundle was that was 2k would not have been enough for it and they lied about it being discounted maybe it was a bug or something idk but yah leaving the reindeer out was kinda odd
---
Do you mean the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Chernobyl series at all?
---
Also, it may have been the fact that i usually build for melee only (ahh memories of a mole miner gauntlet), but i could usually handle a difference of about 20-25 levels before just noping my way out of the aggro range
---
Realistically, silo runs are best done solo anyway, stealth is the big factor in getting through quickly.
---
good luck man. I want this fanbase to grow but at the end of the day if you just cant find that thing you just cant find it. tell grahm I said Hi for me and good luck in your travels.
---
Merry christmas, enjoy your holiday!
---
I’m not sure many countries provide legal protections for other country’s citizens when they’re in the other country
---
True this
---
\* angry  submachine gun noises \*
---
I would wait for Wastelanders to drop. The content drops so far haven’t changed the gameplay loop at all. The endgame is still just grinding for legendaries at the same 3 locations (Whitesprings, West-Tek, and Fissure Site Prime).
---
Nuclear Winter is really fun, but unless you really get into it, it’s not something you’d want to play everyday.
---
Merry Christmas you Filthy Casuals!
---
Is that video still up?
---
Credit where its due they do try to work on updates and fixes as and when they are able
---
But considering a lot of the issues were stuff either the community patched out in 4, or Bethesda were already aware of
---
I think it just rubs me the wrong way those same issues persisted, made me feel like nobody bothered to full stress test the game, which for most companies takes about a full month by a team of 10-15 people for a big company
---
So what ur saying is i can cosplay as the michelan man
---
People placing items in your inventory is a BIG issue. There’s items that can either get you banned or corrupt your whole character.
---
There’s always a couple behind the Whitesprings clubhouse area
---
 Nobody who plays the game puts the periods in. It would just be too painful to talk about it.
---
 A tip. Although it may not be obvious the Combat Knife is the best melee weapon in the game. My top level guy goes out wit 3 of em'. He can crouch in the corner at the club, and melt the entire Golf Club and walk away. ;)
---
As for grahm, he killed a deathclaw for me and spawned inside of that mine shaft you have to do fkr the responders (weird firefighter guys) questline
---
Guessing i got the name wrong, its been a while
---
This.  9/10 times i can't place my camp, it's a survival tent. A whole camp should override a tiny tent.
---
Only you can answer that. It's worth a play imo though it is lack luster in a lot of ways.
---
I feel ya, I get that a lot when I try preaching the word of Atom to random strangers. Also a lot of doors slammed on my face. Too many doors slammed on my face.
---
I have a feeling Zenimax forced Bethesda to push the game out before it was intended to be.  Just my opinion though
---
I do the same with the F.E.A.R. games, kind of OCD at this point for me
---
Also ill give jt a try, i always loved stealth builds or anything melee, so any recommendations would be amazing
---
I've been dressing in Santa outfit with the green fasnacht mask. Taking gifts from santatrons and if you lock your water collectors, you get coal on your bed
---
I gave away my level 30 Nuka T-51 a little while ago to someone else who was leveling a character. They've used it on 2 characters and  they plan on giving it away to someone after that.
---
Your display name though lol 😂
---
you need a role, you have to create your own content in a sandbox.  chapter 1 [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  chapter 2 [https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2](https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2) 
---
there is and has been so much to do from the very beginning I am level 380 and still have more to do than I can accomplish. 
---
in my completely biased opinion you should definately start playing again and join me in my boycottt of legendary weapons. the game is far more engaging without being carried by god roll weapons. 
---
and on that note its time to go hunt down and destroy some SB and legendaries. 
---
Ad Victorium
---
Whilst likely, zenimax has been putting a lot of pressure on Bethesda to fix the game post launch, as they probably lost a fair few sponsors at the start
---
I can imagine that if cd projekt reds cyberpunk has even the slightest issue, it will be a thousand times worse then what Bethesda are getting with fallout 76
---
disagree with cap limit on caps, 
---
first of all, why would you put a cap on caps, it sounds ridiculous, just say it out loud
---
second, we need to be able to have unlimited caps, it is the money of fallout, how would mr vegas build new vegas if there were a cap on caps, it is on the devs to build a proper economy alongside with it and this includes anti-hack systems 
---
however, i now realise this would be too difficult for the devs to implement, so yeah 30K caps and free stuff is good too, im casual player anyway
---
I cant wait for cyberpunk!  Im also stoked for the Command and Conquer remaster!
---
On the web page it's a tab. Written against the black background of the header image. 
---
On the app, search for "returning to fallout 76."
---
Some positivity for a change, I like it! I grew up in the wasteland playing every game in the series. And I still love playing fo76 too. Merry Christmas vault dwellers!
---
Have an upvote.
---
Sweet thanks a bunch for this, ill check that out whilst my games install
---
I think I've recovered from such but haven't tested it extensively but think sharing so others can test it would be best.
---
1.  Join a server that your friend is on.
---
2. Build, etc.
---
3. Intentionally crash such as Alt+F4 on Windows.
---
4. Get back in and join that same server and see if your build is there and still yours.
---
Remember, I only did this unintentionally (real crash) and I was surprised as I joined my friend and my workshop was still mine.
---
MY FRIEND WASNT ON THAT DAY!! I usually do that. Also my friend demands screws, lead and sometimes flux when he joins me
---
I did not know that was a thing, i will definitely check it out as command and conquer has been a staple of my childhood for a long time
---
On that note, if only i could find the person responsible for the time splitters series and ask them for a remake, then my life would likely be perfect game wise
---
Start here:
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
There are one or two that look like they're near a river, but smaller bodies of water don't always show on the map, so do a little legwork.
---
Also note that this is a very very common request, and any sites that match that description will very frequently be taken when you log in, so expect to do a lot of world reloading before you can get in game.
---
There's a small lake below Lucky Mine, which has a lot of lead.  I really liked the view from my camp as well.
---
Merry Christmas fellow SeventySixers!
---
Yeah that entrance *screamed* trap base, didn't surprise me at all.
---
Merry Christmas. You got me cryin in the club
---
I'm not F1st, but would love to participate!  I'm Central time zone.  I'll send you a friend invite!
---
Yeah, they are working on it.  I heard they had staffers from the original Westwood studios helping out as well.  Many a nights was i all hopped up on instant coffee playing the original C&amp;C.  The second one, Tiberian Sun is my all time fav, so hopefully they dont screw it up.
---
Yeah, sadly I was semi afk uploading the vid and came back to the game to watch a level 11 enter it, its times like these i really wish I had a mic.. smh
---
Dont jingle them, they haven't been touched in a while. They're liable to go off like a Supermutant suicider and make a mess
---
Funny I make sure everyone hears me rip a bong I guess I gotta get a vape now
---
It’s a game I play but would never recommend anyone I play with actually getting. But I still find enjoyment in it
---
 You need all the stuff to make that work. Twisted Muscles, Bloody Mess and of course all the Gladiator and Incisor. My knives are all 40% Speed, he doesn't use anything else, and go out around 150, more for the Nocturnal. That escalates rapidly wit Adrenaline and a knife around 225 doing 4 stabs a sec is a fearsome thing. Scorchbeasts die real quick. ;)
---
I have posted about this a lot and I don’t think they are going to fix it any time soon with everything else going on. It’s so awesome having a death claw and a mega sloth at my camp but they all died super fast. Would be nice for all the effort needs to find them to keep them around permanently and have an option to heal them like the fixing camp items.
---
I just came here to make the same comment. Very naughty!
---
Truth.  I'm a high school Comp Sci teacher with a degree in Comp Sci.
---
I tell my students the difference between a college educated programmer and DIY is the former learns the science and why of programming, whereas the latter just learns to code.
---
So for example when I was working once on a project with a script that kept dying when I changed it from one project to mine.  The programmer insisted the fault lay with my adaptation.
---
Turned out the guy wrote a database with ZERO indexes and then put an if check to see if a user existed in a db and didn't even use lazy evaluation when he was checking for user existence.  
---
It worked in his project because the |n| in his project was under 1k where n is the user database.  My project was n &gt; 600k.
---
My friend will go in. Clear area. Click first three ultracites. Then exit cavern. Forcequit game. Reenter private. First three are back. Unlimited
---
I’ve only been a fallout fan for a short while (about half a year or less), and I absolutely love the games, especially fallout 76. When I first got it, I was worried that it was going to ruin my view on the franchise because of what I had heard about it. But, ironically, I find myself wanting to play this more than the other games. I just love exploring Appalachia, building up my own camp, and everyone I meet is amazing and extremely friendly. I remember higher levels giving me and my friends stimpaks, although I often didn’t want to take them. And because of that, I try to give every low level something when I meet them. So a merry christmas to everyone, and let’s hope that the wastelanders update will be a good one.
---
Merry Chrysler
---
Used my private last night. I have way too much scrip now
---
Would you say having every mutation is a bad thing as my last character all but one of them, marsupial i believe
---
There are new daily challenges everyday.  I’m pretty sure they always reward Atoms.
---
Upvote bc i never thought about it and am curious.
---
I think you are wrong, however I fear that you are right
---
Unfortunately the only one I know is up north in the Eastern part of the toxic valley
---
Also the one in the toxic valley can be close enough to a junk producer too
---
As long as they stick to the basics, it should be fine, at least we get a new release, unlike those expecting half life 3
---
Gross
---
It’s not released yet, but people can spawn it in with hacks.
---
Yea im craving fod that sweet 10% off every other 24 hours :D
---
If you initiate the Daily: Thrill of the Grill it’ll give you compass points for radstag herds. (Optional)
---
Outer World's was garbage, 76 is garbage. Now what?
---
Bethesda could shit down your guys throat and you would happily gulp that shit down.
---
Merry Christmas. Now get outta my sight.
---
\*laughs in 50's\*
---
This hack has already been patched.
---
The hack the person below you mention has already been patched. Items can no longer be taken from your inventory.
---
My bad. I'm on PC.
---
I'm not a fan of the gold Fuzzy ride. People already bought the regular Fuzzy ride, and you should give them this skin for free. If that's already the case, I take it back, but it seems shady to sell reskins of cosmetics.
---
Same exact underwhelming experience. I will probably go back to blue neon.
---
There's a spot down in the cranberry bog - I can't exactly pinpoint it but I always run into a mothman or the flatwoods monster down there.
---
This is a nice gesture but you should say what platform you're on, unless I'm completely stupid (and slightly tipsy) and missed where you mentioned it. xD
---
Being that everyone is now in their underwear, Fallout 76 introduces "Privates Servers"....
---
There's no doubt, as sure as a horrible social media comment gets someone put on a watchlist then so would trap camps. Behavior like that is suspicious.
---
I've heard some pets can take radiation damage as well. I've had people kill my pets with splash damage as well. I've given up on taming until they get protections against dying or the ability to respawn. I shouldn't have to hop for 4 hours to tame something that's going to die either on it's way to my camp or as soon as it gets there.
---
I double that, had a cap there at level 140 and saw him for the first time. 😊
---
No if you take any items out it just breaks the blueprint.
---
You do know this is Bethesda and  nothing will be done about it punishment wise .. just my 2 cents lol give up on these fools already, they destroyed fallout and such a damn shame for it was my upmost favourite game series ever, fallout 4 was a watered down version and now 76 is well it's this heap, personally I've been done with them since 76 launch, I'd suggest others do the same if yous want change.
---
So he never gets stuck on pathing or anything where he walks back and forth in generally the same spot? That's usually the sign that they can get stuck and teleport. There may also be the bug of mass death effecting pets now when you first log in and the game doesn't recognize it as a pet for a few moments allowing the purge to claim it.
---
I got a free scavatron thing from the atom shop and put it by my camp .so far trip trip it has managed to pick up about 15 gifts for me.
---
That’s what I ended up deciding to do after playing around with the character builder. Of course, I have selected all of the wrong cards along the way, but c’est la vie.
---
What self image should I work on? I frankly don't care how I look to others, I can act however I please to someone because we have freedom of speech, I don't believe I'm easily offended, just stating that you shouldn't have wasted your time replying to this thread, if that makes me easily offended because I replied to something about a subject that I don't quite care about, as I don't even play Fallout 76, then man, I feel sorry for those that try to have legitimate arguments about topics like this
---
https://youtu.be/t039p6xqutU
---
Those are not in the game yet.
---
Garbage people doing garbage things in a game with garbage coding.  Story of Fo76. They need to get serious and play big boy game developer and ditch amateur hour coding we've had since the beginning.  Austin needs to be shut down and the reigns handed to competent coding staff with NEW management who knows WTF they are doing.
---
Haven't seen him since BETA.
---
Merry Christmas to all vault dwellers!
---
So they should bush camp afk, or not bush camp afk?
---
Yes they have.  We call them "unofficial patches". The entire last year is filled to the brim with blatant examples of incompetence, ranging from marketing, to development, to customer support. To say they are merely "annoying" is, at best, disingenuous. It's a flat out lie.  
---
The sheer amount of times modders have had to fix Bethesda's games, all the while Bethesda ignoring said fixes only to repeat the exact same bugs in latter releases is astounding. Their forums don't even work properly.  
---
They've been warned by modders for years, and chose to do nothing.  
---
They lie to you, repeatedly. They make the same mistakes, over and over. Why? Because of people like you. YOU harm this game more than any of the trolls you never stop mentioning (even in a Christmas greeting). You're the biggest problem.
---
Ah,gotcha . Gotta lighten the stash box right. I've been picking up some things here and there like plans with the purpose to give them away as well
---
Merry Christmas fellow dweller
---
Maybe just unlucky? I get a to of small and regular gifts
---
Bush Wookies Unit!
---
Read this as autism armor. Took me a minute..
---
They also spawn across from the power plant workshop in the forest, and by the dmv.
---
I dont disagree, but i just scrolled hot for a page and a few pages on fresh and didnt see a single topic complaining about it unless i missed one.
---
Fwiw the video actually shows about 30 thefts, not 500, but it certainly could have affected thousands in the aggregate.
---
+1 Extra Chromosome 😂
---
Karma hoe
---
There is a real difference between hate and criticism though.
---
As a non player i can get behind everything you say in this post EXCEPT the part about enjoying fo76 making you a real fallout fan.  Definitely could have omitted that part.  Regardless good on you for enjoying a game even if you aren't supposed to.
---
I wasn't camping in the bust I swear, I was trying to take a dump and a bloat fly stung my ass.
---
14k isn’t too bad, the issue is you need to nearly double that since the challenges don’t stack.  That issue is compounded by the fact many people travel around the holidays, spend time with family, etc.  I frequently get in the top 10, but still find this a heck of a grind since I can’t play for hours at a time, and like many, still have to work regular hours.  I’ll get it done, but it probably won’t be til around the new year.
---
Merry Xmas to you &amp; everyone, i'm alone this year so i'll be playing with the community!
---
I'm a heavy build, and I know a guy with a plasma flamer, but he's also the one who lent me a Vampire's Explosive gatling plasma and with the beam splitter it melts scorched hoards, beasts, and queens alike. I actually use my Junkie's .50 cal in most groups and events so I don't kill stuff quickly (I've been on the recieveing end of players who aren't so considerate, it sucks).
---
60% of the time it works everytime but has a 20s cooldown
---
Once had a dude lighting a joint in the middle of the match, really distracting.
---
Yeah I mean, the whole point is to show those who are still playing Fo76 that bethesda doesnt give a shit and made a broken game. If they made a decent game and weren't trying to make so much fucking money on things like private servers it wouldn't even be possible.
---
People complain about it being too much, but it’s not as frequent as other stuff.
---
Just found out about this and booted up on a whim... rolled 3 times, got a Van/Sent/INT Wood LL And a Troubleshooter’s PA +1STR Meat Hook... scrip well spent!
---
Greed. . .
---
The worst example is fast traveling to a Scorchbeast Queen battle already in progress.  You'll spawn in, but you likely won't see other players, or the Queen herself, for a good minute.  You'll hear them, however, which is a rather surreal experience.
---
Had a similar experience. lol

Is Nuclear Winter the Battle Royal mode? I've seen some videos on it, they seem to say that while its pretty buggy it can be pretty fun if you aren't taking it seriously. Can you still use addons like at launch? I remember there being a perk card swap addon and chat addon that a lot of people used. It seemed at the time Bethesda didn't care about you using them.
---
No. A bunch of bugs popped up again. Still no NPC. 100  dollar subscription.
---
Many people like myself browse r/all and continually pop into subs we aren't subscribed to.  My subs are specifically for quick access to subs with valuable information.  When I am just wasting time on reddit it is through r/all. Loads of people use reddit this way.
---
There's only so much typing you can do to create context. I was bound to miss something. The implication is that my 15% downvoters claim anyone who can play this game isn't a fan because we aren't demanding more. And my point is that we're taking what is a Fallout game boiled to it's very base essence and we love it *anyways*. You would have to be a "fan" to be able to do that. There's such a thing as realizing that it's just a video game. This isn't World War III. We should be grateful to have digital entertainment. We live in a time where remakes are everywhere, nostalgia is running high, and we get a persistent version of a basic Fallout that we can share with others. Why can't we love that? *shakes his head* In any case, all i'm gonna do is create more holes for people to throw crap at me through. The point is to stay positive!! STAY POSITIVE!  HO HO HO HO HO!
---
Are you also in game?
---
Merry christmas! Or happy holidays!
---
*reloading a 5.56 bloodied*
---
Nah, I'm bored now.
---
Fair enough.
---
The fact that you can get all of them in a day besides the last two (those two take about two days) and you have until the 6th is it? Before you miss out. It’s fair considering you had about two weeks less to do the Halloween one, and most people still got that one.
---
Yea,why?
---
I love these types of players, or the ones with more than plenty caps that visit my vendors and just buys stuff with the intention of just giving caps.
---
I thought they were broken, what do they do?
---
Gave a level 7 a Full Pimped Out Raider PA, a Lvl 1 AA hunting rifle (3*), ammo for it, stimpaks, a 1* wood armor for something, radaway and radX. Food and water.
---
Yes
---
They are a crafting **part** for vault raid gear
---
There is no hate there is only yule.
---
There’s an Xmas tree underwater near the bridge in Point Pleasant
---
Merry Christmas scavs
---
Okay thanks
---
I hope the hackers remember not to pick the soap up in the shower.
---
Merry Christmas Fellow Vault Dwellers!
---
This is one hack that deserved the headlines on Yong Yea, Juice Head and Upper Echelon posts.  This was so negligent on BGS's part.  BSG KNOWS this game is hated (irrationally) by other Fallout gamers and that they are conducting acts of terrorism to hopefully destroy the game and drive away the user base. All it's going to do is drive everyone to 1st subscriptions to avoid their stupidity which is not what they hoped to promote.  BGS probably sees this as a plus selling more 1st subs.
---
Yeah no... they timed their attacks during Christmas company breaks with the intention to do damage. The hacks were created by one person but released to a site filled with hackers knowing that they would be abused with snarky comments saying not to abuse it. This is not good will, this is not trying to improve the game; this is intentional timed targeting with intent to cause harm and damage to the game. If they wanted to point out flaws they could personally contact Bethesda and give them all the files in private without releasing said hack to a entire community that is suffering from 76 derangement syndrome. This hack has done nothing but hurt innocent people and benefit those wanting to cause chaos and harm to a game they dislike.
---
Any source on your estimation on the active playerbase?  
---
If there are no statistics available, I'm afraid your guess is just that.
---
I truly take offense to you saying that the "true" Fallout fans like 76.
---
Lights take a lot of resources. They have to cast shadows, cause reflections, etc, etc. That's why they are limited.
---
Maybe for weekly berry picking challenge
---
Sex Panther 😂
---
Vault Boy got ran over by a radstag walking home from our CAMP out Christmas eve
---
I think so.
---
As so many of us truly take offense to say that "true" fans do not. In the end, if you don't subscribe to what I subscribe to then the point should be to scroll on and live your best life. Merry Christmas to you all the same, Pizza Delivery person. 🎄
---
You mean the stuff like patriotic suit and head, and paint jobs? They'll be in the corresponding build menus.
---
Suit will be under your armor tab, tricentenial paint job will be under the weapons paint jobs
---
The 1 cap vending machine thing hack is still there. A friend of mine lost a very rare plan that way for 1 cap.
---
I don’t understand what it is you posted? Is that just PC?
---
I really hope wastelanders is good, because I got through with basically all the good story quests ages ago.
---
Yeah. I have a lovely spot at white spring now,  it's often taken when I log in.
---
Looks to be Denver Bronco inspired.
---
Should have napalmed the fuck out of it
---
Ouch. I hate that portion of the map. Thx!
---
Well hot damn.
---
All hail our lord and savior...
---
Sey
---
He left the server a few mins after the level 11 went in and died  
---
Luckily ive ran into another one in whitesprings right now, so gonna nuke it instead :D
---
Wtf
---
I sayed i enjoy it, does not mean i can't see it is a broken mess, because denying it is being a liar, and momma rised no lier, this as any other bethesda game is a mess, it is broken, it is filled with bugs... And i enjoyed it
---
It goes up and down, some sales are better than others.
---
Merry Christmas! I've been playing Fallout since the first game and I'm not about to stop now. Sure, some decisions from Bethesda have made me raise an eyebrow and perhaps utter a few expletives, but I'm still playing because it's Fallout.
---
Merry Christmas!!
---
It's a thing of its own; very satisfying from artistic and gameplay aspects (even more if you're into Fallout), with abysmal support and technical side... Also not really that easy to get into - lotta layered and hidden mechanics; definitely not a casual game.
---
You got pwnd, just like the rest of them.  Better luck next time.
---
Instructions unclear, shat in the coat and cleaned my arse with the bushes.
---
What are they use for walls? they look very cool
---
How big is the game...because the patch would need to contain new versions of literally every file...
---
The tight rope place is cool. You can set up a build so the only way in to your camp is crossing the tight rope. 
---
If you have a jet pack, rocketing to the top of the mountains by the top of the world and camping there is cool.
---
If you unplug them they can still be bought from, they just don’t show up on the map
---
Merry Christmas. Wish everyone the best.
---
You get downvoted but it's exactly that. To me it seems like the idea to run so much client code unchecked is ridiculous from the start. When they sat down to come up with an architecture, surely they would come up with something better than that. Even with the worst management, a 10 year old tech stack and a few months of time. If this is a management failure, they screwed up like I've never seen before.
---
You sir, deserve an upvote. Here you go
---
Don't you get perks and attributes as you level up to keep?  I don't know.
---
Correlation is not causation. The hacker made that hack and then released it, not YongYea. Not to mention, Bethesda made that kind of hack possible to begin with.
---
I’ve noticed after setting up the CAMP you can move the CAMP object around within the build circle &amp; tamed pets have a tendency to gravitate to it; took it out of my cramped house and put it outside &amp; my pets go where it goes.
---
I feel as though if it was a lower number of people that bought 1st, they’d increase the sale number. That way more people would be inclined to get it. So I assumed a great percentage of their active player base bought 1st.
---
well I mean it's a part of the role play I guess, lol
---
It is a virtual escape, from a world filled with political correctness. In fallout 76 I can do the finger firing emote on you all day (pvp emote) and not get a grievance report filed on me for being so offensive by doing so.
---
Because of new content. seeing as everything is tradeable in this game any new content with new gear is subject to beeing instantly available to the richest of the rich. Most multiplayer games who deal with trading has a mechanic were either the current currency becomes obsolete or there is a limit to what is available for the player to buy. There should be a limit on caps, but is 30k high enough? Debatable, i think it should be higher.
---
Merry Christmas to everyone! Hope you all have a wonderful evening and Christmas morning!
---
did you get your stuff back
---
No we don’t deserve a asshole hacker just cause we enjoy something that’s asinine your just like the people I described
---
CHRISTMAS?! BAH! HUMBUG!
---
Yes, and I'm not arguing against that. 
---
I'm stating that if you pay _real world money_ for an object, part of what you're paying for should be the ability to use it.
---
One of the most frustrating parts of the game. Soo much loading times. Just leaving an interior to exterior can take 1 minute.
---
Free flaming bag of poop decoration.
---
Or bone shards.
---
legendary power armor, survival mode but the only difference is that there's no pvp limits, none of that weird damage nerf stuff compared to adventure, and make caps a little more difficult to obtain and  more cap sinks to make the cap's value go up, bethesda plz
---
I mean, if I grind for say an hour, I might have 2-3 larges, 5ish medium and a dozen small. It's decidedly weighted to the medium/small end.
---
Just best practice so people know if what they have can even get to you.
---
My thanks. 
---
When I made the comment my first reply was sitting at like -3. It's hilarious.
---
Unless you are running a bloodied build. In which case, may your rads be stable.
---
A little vape hit here and there isn’t that bad...
---
But damn, is your habit really that bad where you have to hit it DURING THE MATCH? You can’t wait 15 mins???
---
Hey, to each their own. It’s a free country, do what you want!
---
I've been giving away my legendary pick ups from the scorched to lower lever players. I don't need the scrip,  i figure they can either use the weapons or get the scrip for it.
---
Berkley springs train station, just down the road before you get to the power substation where there's always a random spawn. I always find radstags in between that random spawn point and the tent by the train tracks.
---
I love you! I'm facepalming so hard right now.... my fingers are out my neck....
---
GIVE ME A FUCKING REFUND
---
Yeah - atheists are the smart ones ones - merry xmas from an atheist. Christmas is actually the winter solstice borrowed by the early god botherers.
---
thank you for the update brother! Happy holidays back at you!
---
Dude. It's not "easy" most people flat out don't have the _time_ to devote multiple real world days to grinding for a cosmetic item.
---
January 6th
---
Yup.   
---
Trap bases are a thing, and the people who build them are shitty fucking assholes. This is not news.
---
Cigs, yeah. Weed, not so much. It doesn't really leave a residue on stuff like cigs do, not sure why. I assume it does eventually, but not even close to as easily as cigs.
---
I just built my base there few days ago, great spot except that some mobs sometimes show up. One time my turret got wonky and started shooting other turrets and then they all got in a firefight with each other for some reason..
---
👍😁
---
I guess if you enjoy the loop it doesn't matter much beyond the initial purchase.  I got the game for free so most thing don't bother me.  Even if I got robbed it wouldn't matter much, but I see how it could frustrate people. I hate on Pokemon Sword and Shield but I don't really hate on FO76 except for the direction of a lot of there business decisions, I certainly do add my thoughts to how they should have implemented the game modes.
---
There's a nice spot near 'Crashed Plane' in there mire. It's up on a cliff, and has some bloodleaf and a black titanium node.
---
To be fair hacking/Cheating is not exclusive to Fallout 76,it is endemic in all PC based online games.
---
There are no exceptions.
---
Coders get smarter,hackers get smarter.
---
The logic of the hackers is Bizarre.We hack the game and steal peoples stuff to show in game vulnerabilities.
---
By this logic, if a Burglar breaks in to your House and steals all your personal belongings.He should be thanked for highlighting your security vulnerabilities.
---
Same thing happened to me and I haven’t found a fix I would suggest to put in a ticket
---
Scorchbeast, Scorchbeast Queen, and Mirelurk Queen Claw plans still aren't available ingame yet.
---
I’d like to see a camp on the ending of the monorail line southeast of savage devide leading to cranberry bog. You can walk this line up there pretty far but it’s bloody slippery and comes with a dead end.
---
Yes. many of them are not much use, although Marsupial is very useful indeed.. For melee you need the 25% Twisted Muscles has. As well Healing Factor allows me to sell Stimpacks. Adrenal Reaction is also very good as you Health and everything stacks. Speed Demon matter less for a melee char, but I like the speed in Stealth. The Chameleon mutation is useless, a bit of Chameleon Legendary however is great. ;)
---
Cheers to you.     I'd like to get that particular tree - how much xp do I need ?
---
And I want to say merry xmas to Bethesda. Thanks for never retaliating to the goddamn awful posts that people make.
---
Got through scrapping almost 50 .. Everything but automatic receiver RNG hates me :)
---
Which Mirelurk plans do you need? Claw and King? I have Sloth and Claw is you want to trade for you longshoreman and jack-o-lantern suits. Won’t be on for a couple of hours though.
---
I haven't seen the list so I appreciate your response. I need the mirelurk king, hunter, and gnallygaster then. I just got the ghoul heads earlier. I didn't even know they were possible.
---
...why on earth don't you just farm lucky hole mine in excavator armor for lead?
---
 You seem to get the good ones last. It took, I don't like to think about how many, forever, to get the Suppressor.
---
I will dm you and many thanks
---
Is it difficult to get that xmas tree in NW?
---
Not worth the hassle of having to server hop to spawn your camp in my opinion.
---
Get the excavator armour, go to lucky hole mine (there is a reason this advice is repeated ad-nauseous), deplete all the ore veins.
---
Get some acid (cave crickets provide a lot, so do snallygasters I think) OR alternatively take hemlock holes workshop and just collect the acid from the extractors.  There is also a vault raid that spawns endless crickets if you don’t progress past a certain area BUT I find it annoying to do solo due to having to use rad-away, or power armour, or a hazmat suit (I am a bloody stealth commando).
---
Smelt the lead ore at your chemist work bench (with super duper equipped if you have it) and watch your lead pile up.
---
As for making ammo you also need steel and gunpowder.
---
Gunpowder needs cloth and acid to be made...you get plenty of cloth from pre-war money and the easiest way to get that in bulk is doing the collision course event at the airport a few times.
---
As for steel there are a lot of ways to get it but the easiest is to have the scrapper perk and just go kill a bunch of mole miners (uranium fever event is good for that, or Welch), super mutants (see the capitol building, Westek, or that town that always has mutants in the middle of the map and scrap their weapons.
---
You could also take the Grafton steel mill for a double whammy...lots of super mutants AND it produces 80 steel per game hour.
---
For builds, i used to run the radiation and health heals when in sunlight, is that needed at all or is it preference
---
Also with the leveling, i use the nukes and dragons website to plan them out, but should i save all my points till the end or use them as i get them as ive always seemed to screw it up
---
Merry Christmas! I’ve spent most of my Christmas Eve in the game. I rebuilt my C.A.M.P. and went hunting. Happy day indeed.
---
Damn I Remember Berkeley springs workshop first defence .. scortchbeast , mothman joins the party follows by flatwoods monster .. I got trashed .. thanks for the memory!
---
Sure. Dismiss valid criticism so OP can have his  jolly christmas. Different opinions and critique be damned. Right?
---
 I'm on PC, but the only ones I respond to is the rather rare: 
---
 "Help I'm stuck in a cabin and the Scorchbeast won't go away."
---
Yep.. but the wait is worth it
---
Hope I get to see it. :)
---
Well they could roll back characters, but there's no real way to track item exchanges at a it seems, even if it is all items
---
I fully understand that. I help low levels on ps4 as I see them, especially if they are out of the forest. I don't have much more time to farm is the only reason I an posting.
---
Merry Chryslus!!!!
---
At least I'm not the only one that seem's to be having bad luck with RNG,  all I got were nocturnal stuff and good rolls on the wrong weapon, ***furious/33 vats/25 less vats fatman.
---
Nope, even if you just spawn in AFK it should only take about 5 games. 3 games if you’re trying. 2 if you make top 3
---
Doesnt show at all. I shouldnt need the parts if I have the mod. I'm not talking about cant build mods, I have a pre built mod that I only want to attach. Sometimes you pick these things up, like spikes walking cane mod, attach it to a walk cane etc
---
It is a requirement to reach full happiness in life
---
If they’re high enough to PVP, they’re high enough to party 😉
---
"The game is dying" oh god please spare the dramatic. If you wanna see a game dying go to r/Dayz
---
You will never won over the majority of this sub because you can't serve two opposites. You know your intentions, so don't worry. Thanks for the update
---
This whole idea of the this "true" Fallout fan idea you're pushing is really more divisive than anything.
---
Who is that and why is he wearing a vault suit?
---
Jk , jealous i dont have one.
---
 The thing about Perks, is that done right, there are no QoL Perks. ;) You need every single slot for Damage and Defence. You can of course, and I do, slot the sunlight Rad Cure for a while but when you are done put back the proper set. 
---
 I forget all the time to put back my fighting set, but an unexpected death will get that fixed quick. ;).
---
253
---
Whenever I see him ( not recently ) I try to avoid him as he doesn't carry much loot and he looks really cool and I don't want to fight him.  He is persistent in his attacks if he locks on to you. The sci fi music is good too.
---
I think it was a reaction to ManyATrueNerd's video on the atomic shop complaining about it. I've noticed it in the intervening fortnight
---
Not yet 😢 Was on for a few hours last night and today and I still have zilch. Only good thing is the community has come through and hooked me up with some nice weapons and armor, along with ammo and chems so I can still play. Probably won't see any of my stuff till they do a rollback... If that happens.
---
It feels like i'll/we'll never get a clean or variants of the Garb of Mystery at this point. I know the Christmas themed sales/releases are a bad time to even hope for it, but every time we get these posts, and when someone posts all the upcoming leaked content, there is always some small hope for a Order of Mysteries bundle or Mistress of Mystery outfit that gets smaller each time.  I'm still hoping for something with Wastelanders, maybe.
---
I came across this base, along with other trap bases in the past. I don't actually mind getting caught out by them as they are often quite creative. It:s ok trolling in my book :)
---
Where are the new NW rewards listed?
---
That's only case on PC.  Xbox people are welcoming.
---
My bloody FFR combat rifle is named “leaky shark”
---
Randolph the one man sheriff Sheriff had a very shiny gun. When any of the valters ,valters saw it they would turn away and run. Then one Christmas eve santa came and asked Randolph with your gun so bright wont you mascre my slay tonight.Then all the other vaulters gifted him a small gift.
---
ROTFLMFAO. I'm sure you are right. ;)
---
I just started a new toon, my 4th.  Before I’d made it to level 14 I’d already had 1 plasma mine and 3 plasma grenades drop. My 3 other characters haven’t had a single plasma grenade or mine plan drop between them. 
---
RNGesus.
---
It exists but not in such a vague context
---
I suppose I should take this moment to thank my XBox for busting the last update so hard (it got stuck part way through downloading and absolutely refused to progress for literally days on end) that I tried to cancel and restart the update and ended up with the entire game getting deleted from my console.
---
On the other hand, I'm on so rarely any more that the only thing I've been missing out on is free atom shop stuff and the Christmas event because my XBox is still having a mind of its own.
---
Events with legendaries where I always forget to bring a secondary weapon to tag them so just start face punching everything.
---
I want to make a trap room at my base and put "TRAPS - DO NOT ENTER" in neon letters. I know people would still enter it.
---
You too man. Nice talking to you too.
---
 Exactly. Then of course you need Hemlock Holes for Acid ......
---
This is why I lurk. I'm too middle of the road for this sub anymore.
---
MC ... Cheers to all.. I lift this nuka cola to your good health and prosperity 🙂
---
That's ore, right? Laziness?
---
 You forgot the obligatory Chemist Perk from Intelligence. ;)
---
laughed at this too hard
---
Lovely response,  thanks.
---
Hmm. Strangeness.
---
Dude in like 10 minutes you have 300-400 ore. Any other method is slower and harder.
---
Yup. But the impatients will cry worse than us patients.
---
The worst thing about trap bases is that they're usually lame. If you're going to lure people into your death camp at least give'em a show and a little pizazz. Make their death interesting.
---
The drop rate of acid from there means it's just not worth it unless you're doing other things on a private server all day.
---
Its the initiation into the game
---
Search “Fo76 overseer rank” on google. It’ll take you to the fandom, and the list is near the bottom of the page for Xmas rewards
---
Also gunpowder. Don't forget gunpowder. Got a twelve year old ony Xbox friends list who was trying to sell gunpowder for a couple hundred caps each out in the swamp area, and I had to wait until I knew I wouldn't burst out laughing before I finally could tell him he needs to take it out of his vendor or at least lower it to a cap, if he insists on selling it.
---
Same
---
first online game?
---
Yeah - so online games are evolving ever changing things. They are forever being updated, patched, hotfixed, and expanded. It's the nature of the sub-genre.
---
Trust No One in the Wasteland!
---
No big deal.
---
You can change it later and right now it won’t matter in the slightest.
---
I am a bloodied stealth commando and have 6 in intelligence, 3 for nerd rage and 3 for gunsmith (so my guns breaks slower).  I also need around that amount to equip needed perks for crafting and repairing.
---
Damn that’s pretty terrible
---
Keep the change!
---
I love my 1* instigating lever action. More stars would be ok but it’s so bad ass silenced with a sniper/stealth build. At night I can get 2400 per head shot.
---
 I must admit my Heavy Gunner does use his Fallout 1st account for precisely that reason. Fire up Hemlock and Grafton Steel, mine the Lucky Hole and I can keep his guns fed. Otherwise I hesitate to use em' much
---
Hey frogo. lol did you see what I said? Hope not. Heard that was an edited photo of sinseer anyway lol
---
Seriously. It seems to depend on what exact moment you post stuff for it to either be downvoted to hell or upvoted to heaven by people who either set their copy of FO76 on fire every morning or suck Todd Howard's dick every morning. There is no weather forecast for this sub. Just dress for everything, at this point.
---
They pick the lock not hack omg lol.
---
Thats actually what sinseer looks like, he has hair tho
---
Thanks for that, ill give it a while in the morning, currently installing ffxv atm so will wait until then
---
Hair makes a huge fucking difference lolol
---
Please illuminate me, when I mod Fallout 4 or NV or 3 to create a stable and largely bug free play environment, I always wonder and am even exasperated that these steps weren't taken by the game devs themselves. Am I wrong in thinking that each iteration of the creation engine which is introduced with each new title release continues to exhibit the same fundamental flaws and tendencies that only ever get fixed by the community, and in the case of FO76, they still didn't bother applying basic, extremely well documented fixes, all while attempting to take it online? Im just a noob modder, so when I read threads like this, I find it very helpful.
---
Legendary drop.  Don’t see many of them.
---
I think I bought mine from someone’s vendor.
---
Now I have a bloodied FFR combat rifle so the hunting rifle just sits in my stash...I can’t bring myself to part with it yet and it outperforms a lever action rifle.
---
Either it changed or my vendors are busted. I blueprinted mine with lettering on each to show what was where, placed them down from the blueprints again later and stock was gone and so was the lettering. Think I also needed to change the skins as well because they were all the default paint job.
---
I would love a set for myself, I've been playing since beta but my 1st character is only around 90. If not for me though then I have two friends who just joined last week that would also be great candidates!
---
Thanks for doing something for the holidays, you rock!
---
This game was a nightmare during the BETA, so I never picked up my pre-order
---
When the game was free for a weekend here recently on PlayStation, I tried it out
---
I immediately went out and bought a used copy, and a month of Fallout 1st
---
I love this game for what it is and would love for it to continue to receive support and love from its community
---
Merry Christmas, love you all!
---
Yeah I made sure he was walking a clear path last night before I logged out... even have video 😂
---
Much better. Now I can untie the knots in my undies.
---
Merry Christmas! Still playing with a friend after my brother quit, and loving it!!!
---
U have one or u need one
---
Hmm. Thanks for the tip.
---
Merry Christmas Friends... See you out there :)
---
That's exactly what I am thinking. People acting like countries can just extend their own laws into another country. Bethesda can say "If we find out who you are, and you come to the west, we will prosecute you" all that they want, but it doesn't mean its going to come to anything. This situation rarely happens for terrorists seeking asylum and murderers, so I can safely say that hacking a video game doesn't get priority in international law.
