Yeah, I was a lvl 5 despite my hours of gameplay because I was busy making the best CAMP I could make for me and my friends. Then some level 200 something in an X-01 armor appeared and checked my camp, after a tense silence used an emote of approval, told me to come and gave me a lvl. 5 fully upgraded 2-shot legendary hunting rifle (did +90 dmg before a patch that nerfed the legendary perk). Being such a low level I didn't know what to do, but told him on the mic to wait, because I remembered I had a fusion core. I gave it to him, he made a heart emoji and left.  What made it more wholesome and hilarious was that I had the radio with ["Dear hearts and gentle people"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0JfAHA2ew) on all the time.

---
I play on PC and I don't remember who that was, but from that moment I knew this game would be awesome. My CAMP used to be by the river at Flatwoods, near the church, but with the Wild Appalachia patch I had to make a new one upstream (too close to a mission area).
---
---
---
Surely dont hope I have to kill the 16,000 robots again.
---
I'm sure this is in here somewhere,  but we have a radio station building.  All Bethesda needs to do is have a quest that opens it up, and allows us to "find" new holo tapes.  It can unlock a new radio station with a robot dj (since no human npcs). They could add new music in as we find it,  monthly quest etc...
---
If they stick to public domain stuff licensing should be cheaper.  Shoot why not higher somebody to compose fallout sounding music?  Then no licensing problem, like most of us would know if a song was created for the game or existed in our history,  lol.
---
I thought they fixed it in the previous patch so power armors‚Äô mods (reactive plates and tesla coil) won‚Äôt count as fight back. People complained about this in the past. I don‚Äôt do pvp so can‚Äôt verify this. I used to use motion-assist servo to add strength, now I‚Äôm using stealthboy. Although stealth is broken it‚Äôs still fun to be able to disappear.

You fools there is more to the wall that he is observing then you think, the wall contains the milk of human kindness.

Dont know how those daily or weekly workshop challenges work and it looks like you have found the way to complete them anyways without problems. Workshops are pvp zone where strongest wins by design. If you have zero interest in pvp then dont click agree when you try to claim the workshop and potentially initiate pvp in the first place. I mean there is an obvious statement when you are claiming one, accept it and you throw yourself in constant chance for pvp.
---
Personally I have also been rekt inside and outside the workshops so nowdays whenever Im playing with workshops Im using my pvp gear just to be safe:

i can still harvest my roof garden after patch, just cant add anything new.

Drop stuff in the toolbox in her camp. It will remain on the server.
---
Thx. My first queen kill. I didn't get anything from her though. Maybe I didn't do enough damage. I used mostly endangerol. 
---
This, I have some 230+ hours and I just came back and I still have nothing to do.
---
I‚Äôm just sitting around my camp helping a level 20 out while I grind ammo for the occasional queen that I don‚Äôt even need to fight anymore. I have several sets of pa. My build is perfect on two characters. I have all the regular armor, weapons etc that I need. Even my mutations are perfect.
---
I ran rolled another toon back in January because I was bored and still nothing to do
---
The PvP mechanic is stupid in this game. The whole card system is a neat idea but for PvP is flawed. If you are actively running around pvp‚Äôin, you have setup your build to do so. 
---
They find someone in else in the world actively doing something other than PvP. So their perk setup is for what they are doing. The PVPer deals damage or annoys till a reaction. Then the battle begins and low and behold the other player gets one shot. Bethesda apparently believed that in the heat of that moment while some ass clown is slap damaging me till I‚Äôm angry enough to start the fight. I will enter the perk menu and swap around all my cards and equipment my PvP gear and weapons. Stupid. Honestly, it‚Äôs like IRL a UFC fighter going against a farmer. 
---
Glad they went with the survival mode to fix this solution. PvP builds, going up against PvP builds.

New songs means paying royalties. Which means definite purchases which, unless they have s large power like Apple behind them, they WONT be 99 cents a song.

Only the host can access their fermenter. It's linked to your stash box, and can hold 10 drinks.

Nice.  Is that tile you have under the chemistry bench available in in the atom shop currently? If not, I'd love to see that in the shop again sometime. Same goes for other limited time items.
---
Heard it‚Äôs very popular at the moment

Want to know where "just a few" cap stashes are or contribute to my list? Check out this thread I have been updating since the patch that removed/changed a bunch of stashes. I checked them all myself manually:

Cheers ill have a look at it.

No, you cannot build a fusion core generator at your camp. Only at a power plant workshop like Poseidon or monogah energy. 
---
I would also like a list if at all possible 
---
But being wantedbmakes all camp hostile, doesn't it?
---
Sure bro. Join my game I‚Äôm in a new server now 
---
Dang I haven‚Äôt played yet and I‚Äôm a tad hyped
---
that reminds me of something actually, and it‚Äôs that I believe bethesda picked the beach boys partly because they used the song in a trailer for the game and they wouldn‚Äôt want to waste the ability to use a song like that so they just put it into the game too
---
Is there a way to find out what the no build zones are?  Lost my original camp spent allot of time building another one in a different place only to log in and find it not placeable. 
---
This was my thought. I'd be willing to do it as well but for sure enemies are going to be 50+ and way more of them.
---
Yeah I guess it's just an stylistic choice and me not liking it is probably a very personal thing. Maybe because of how im used to the look of the fallout 4 lighting. 
---
I try and farm fusion cores late at night when the kiddie griefers are tucked in bed. Works pretty good so far. Take names, block them then jump servers they can't track you for the rest of the night.

That's the tile from the meditation temple place and it was only available for a limited time as well. üò≠

What part of Harper's Ferry? I just drove by there yesterday.

A few people have said they haven‚Äôt got any loot from her! Just keep trying I guess! Dropping another 3 nukes on her now! I‚Äôve switched worlds, join my game if you want to tag along 
---
Some people launch nukes, we launch people. 
---
Unyielding wood is actually dope. Stealth is the best defense when you can't take a hit and unyielding wood with the shrouded mod is extremely effective and easy to farm armor for a bloodied build.
---
I like to think of fo76 as like journey, but with occasional asshats. Random people who intersect with you, mostly helpful but some real turds.
---
I'm not an MMO person either but I'm having fun. The sense of community is refreshing from playing other online games. I hear alot about griefers but I've only run into one and he was lvl 10 while there was a group of three of us with two at lvl 18 and one at lvl 108 so it was a non-issue, just gave up and left us alone after 7 deaths.

Hmm... I wonder if another file is interfering. Have him navigate to that folder and relay what the contents are. Or take a picture.

I'm lvl 60 and find myself with more supplies than I can use these days. I spend some time hunting down low level players and giving stuff away on every log in.

While I understand, and agree with this,  the thought that culture and music froze because technology went in a different direction doesn't mean song from post 1950 couldn't exist. In this world John Denver could have written and performed this song in 1961 because of the differences in the games history.  Just because we have discovered some different music in Appalachia doesn't conflict with the music played in different regions or times.  There isn't a music distribution company in Fallout that is making sure every radio station in the world has access to the same music selection. 
---
Cool I was there all 3 times but for some reason I couldn‚Äôt find the queens body the first time she went down

Its from the 2018 e3 conference. Just Google "Todd Howard it dosent just work". Sorry I'm not smart enough to link. YouTube video from a phone. It is not of an acknowledgement than apology though.
---
I have a explosive plasma gatling I've been using since the patch. It is a bit over 100 dmg per shot and does pretty good damage. I think it's trash for PvP though.

i stayed for all three and it was awesome! Thanks for that!
---
If I find a paper bag at a train station, I figure it is up for grabs. I leave ammo and other unwanted/unneeded stuff in paper bags at train stations all the time because I figure someone will come along and pick it up. 
---
If I find a bag in the middle of no where or in the middle of what has clearly been a fight, I'll leave it in case the owner died and is on their way back to claim their junk.
---
Just a game son, calm down.
---
Strictly for the merchant stuff: max strength and at least three in agility and in intelligence, but it also depends (e.g. if you're not carrying around fusion cores and energy ammo, you don't need the three in intelligence, etc...).
---
Mine are mostly agility/perception/luck but that has more to do with my merchant's non-selling activities (going and farming gear, etc...).
---
Nice doing business with ya - that gun will treat you well!
---
I would approve, if the game was actually fucking playable 
---
They don't spoil in your inventory - they just ferment slower than in the fermenter. When their bar goes to zero, they're done fermenting.

Same here it was quick

A Super Duper Mega Center Raid actually sounds pretty dope. 
---
Maybe get a buddy to let you shoot him and stim him every time he goes down. Then let him do the same for you. I'm sure it can be arranged.

Find someone willing to help you with it. Another guy and I took turns killing and reviving each other. Or, rather, we each jumped off cliffs to die and then revived each other.

Yes, and there's a heap of updates coming this year! Look up Fallout 76 roadmap

If you are on PC and you still have those armor legs, I can get rid of them for you, as I'm running an stealth build
---
Sadly limited. I hope they bring back limited stuff. Even if it only stuff i already got. Since I hate how quick stuff disappears.
---
The Red Rocket sign was buildable in camps for a short bit. (Even who didn't own the atom item) so I built it for multiple friends. Just to spread the love.
---
Damn I'm jealous. I wish ps4 had a crew like you guys. I been seeing you post updates and that was quick! 
---
Wait so you can paint it even if we haven ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù the paint scheme?
---
Damn someone needs a drink. Can I interest you in a vintage nukashine?
---
Oh thanks dam wish I didn't sell my extra nukashine since they were low thought they were expiring.
---
There‚Äôs a pylon over the road from the Whitespring service entrance(?) on the cliffs that I can‚Äôt use as a base anymore :( 
---
It‚Äôs fucking lame and stupid.  Really Bethesda? Hey let‚Äôs brew some alcohol!! Yet I am drinking and eating non stop because of yet another bug but hey that‚Äôs cool you rolled out another feature.  FIX THIS SHIT and gimmicks can come later. 
---
No clue why you got downvotes, this guy enjoyed it. Even if you don‚Äôt agree I find happiness that others are happy doing what they like. So you‚Äôre right it is something.

As soon as you introduce electric arrives, people will start using them for experience grinding. Even just with wood, I am about to farm a ton of boiled water for the experience.

We are dropping another 3 on her in a different server, join my game dudes

This is going to be hard to explain since I‚Äôm not in front of my map but here goes nothing. North of vault 76 at Dolly Sods farm I believe it‚Äôs called? Anyway if your at that spot and you cross over the little pond there that‚Äôs north west of it (more west then north) you‚Äôll find a dirt path that you can‚Äôt build on anymore. It‚Äôs probably like 10 - 20 feet away from the farm.

I assume you are on pc?

i moved it across town and it still took it

Hm..... Your build sounds very similar to mine as far a minimums go. I might be able to convert my main into a merchant as well one day. Good work and thanks for the advice.

Is this your only character?

I had my camp on the bridge in front of Tygart Water. Removed

I can't wait to see 'em. Morgantown is my third-favourite nuke location, and I'm sure I'll do so in the near future myself. 
---
I did two Scorchbeast Queen fights today as a result of hopping on-board other peoples' nukes (both successfull, the latter of which was the first time killing her with my secondary character!), and I was absolutely gobsmacked by how lovely all the luminous flash-ferns everywhere were. As someone whose ultracite ammo of choice (50 cal) needs violet flux, being able to pick it out of the landscape at a distance was such a treat. 
---
bye bye, please let the door hit you on the way out.
---
I love this. Here's hoping, right? 
---
I know what you mean. I can't wait to get home and start grinding again. I never thought I'd be excited to come home from vacation, this has been the longest week of my life. 
---
I've done all BoS quests, including this once but now with technical data and the holo tape I can,t get it to start again any tips?
---
I just wish more of the drops were guns or things that are more useful than armor, because that's most of the drops I see. I'd even be okay with melee weapons, but so many of them can't be used with PA. 
---
Even if it's guns I don't necessarily use, if they have effects that catch my interest I'll actually see if they're useful instead of just dumping them on a vendor. 
---
Can the overclocking happen automatically for some reason? Because I dont remember overclocking anything. I'll check later if that's the case

My daughter just killed her first sbq at level 21. Lol

I really want one of those hot tubs that are at the workshop by New Gad. They'd be great for growing tarberries.
---
Ahh. World full. You are just too popular. 
---
This is an alt for me. I built it thinking it would just be for vending, but in the end it's a bit of a hybrid - has some decent fighting skills, quality-of-life perks, etc... in part because to use the legendary armor I had to get it to level 50+ !
---
World full. In the Queue. Lvl 160
---
Yeah, I imagine that the fact that items get duplicated during a crash will never change. It‚Äôs the ways to force a crash that Bethesda has been patching out, I assume.
---
Lol. Keep trying bro.
---
Nice one bro 
---
Yes it can, I had a function OC Genie I think? Anyways sometimes when the PC crashes the bios default that function to on and puts it a strange clock speed. You need to look up your processor and find the base clock speed then compare it in bios.
---
It could have been a visual error. There was a known issue previously that would make it appear to have double of each piece of armor on a power armor frame. This or you could have made a copy while crafting using the super duper perk unknowingly. I've shared this perk with lower level friends countless times and it scares the shit out of them. 
---
‚ÄúSeverely punished by bounty hunters‚Äù

At least you earned the target on your back whilst the camps you‚Äôre ‚Äúraiding‚Äù are built by bystanders.

Yeeeeeeees maaaaster.

I love subtitles.
---
*intense fighting*
---
Yes. Yes. And more yes!
---
The music they have is fitting, but I end up hearing the same few songs over and over again when I play for a little while. FO4 was great because mods for the radio, but we need some more ‚ÄúWest Virginian‚Äù music in this game. 
---
This happened to me once before. The extra pieces vanished when it recalled to my inventory.
---
Wonder why you can't set up close to Deathclaw Island.
---
I accidentally threw a Molotov inside this fellas house while he was giving me free loot haha felt so bad, he just laughed and fixed his shit 
---
The new BoS paints were already in the game, Bethesda just fixed the leveled list so that its conditions worked properly (previously, it checked to see if you had learned dummy versions of the paints rather than the real ones...)
---
Yes, along with everyone on r/gaming who complained about the bag
---
Agreed if you try to take an owner workshop expect consequences!
---
This sounds very much like what the people with mods get after the patch before they update the custom ini. Have you tried creating the custom ini? Worth a shot. Check nexus mods for the updated file. (you don't need to install any mods)

Yeah, this is not a great game. Popular opinion

Your camp is a lot more impressive

Nice

Sorry that you are still butthurt.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. Bethesda has stated this was the intention all along but will look at changing in the future
---
I run an Instugating, Faster swing speed Grog Axe and a TSE Gatling Gun.
---
Armor wise I run Space Suit or excavator if I need to fast travel while heavy lol.
---
I think the word you‚Äôre looking for is ‚Äúright‚Äù
---
How exactly can I check the bios? Sorry about my ignorance, I just never figured that out.
---
I think adding into this, it gets really hard to fix bugs after deployment. I'm a CS student (so I really don't have much room to talk) and I've had times where I literally started over on an assignment I'd already sunk 10+ hours on because I realized there was a way to make it without bugs. 
---
Beyond that, it's probably just that schools teach students how to code and debug, not how to design software. I'll get off my box now...
---
Can i have your stuff before you un install? 
---
Right...
---
Were you able to get in? I just joined the queue as well
---
Indeed!
---
Did you not read any of the journals or holotapes? She flat out says the order isn't doing anything other than killing countless people. That they aren't helping anyone and points specificly when her mother wouldn't take in a local boy because he was a boy. That boy ended up being Brody. She accused her mother of trying to play super hero instead of helping people.

Almost same set up 1080, 16 GB ram, i7 4 GHz. I get stuck at crafting stations (endless animation), freezing and sudden crashes every so often, usually due to server flakiness. When the server isn't lagging everything is fine. This only after the patch.
---
I love how you say "original game" to make it seem like this game was completely evolved with its content since release.
---
Just dropped attack!!
---
You could claim a workshop or place a camp to be able to fast travel between the two for "free"
---
This reminds me of how glad I am to be able to build radios in our Camp again. Missed that ever since the beta, always liked having a bit of music on (but not blasting in my ears via the Pip-boy) while I'm working on stuff at home.
---
I think i can put stealth boys in for those too if anybody needs those. Not X-01 because the plans aren't available.
---
Yeah!!! I'd love to listen to ring of fire while roaming inside a blast zone lol. 
---
I‚Äôm level 33 playing on Xbox over the past couple weeks. My experience has been mostly pleasant with other people. I‚Äôve had high level players drop me stuff and help out against mobs without a word. I‚Äôve gotten random invites from people of all levels looking to party up.
---
But a couple days ago I encountered the biggest pole smoker I‚Äôve seen in a game. I‚Äôm trying to do the Recruitment Blues quest, which is easy enough, right? And suddenly I start hearing gunfire. This level 116 guy comes in and starts killing every NPC Mr Gutsy in the area, shoots at me as I‚Äôm trying to complete the obstacle course and ‚Äúfind the traitor‚Äù portion of the quest, nearly killing me even though I never fired back at him until I finally manage to slam a couple doors in his face and fast travel away. I block him so he can‚Äôt see where I am and wait about a half hour to go back. 
---
When I go back the fuckface is sitting in front of the targets I need to shoot for the shooting range portion of the quest, knowing I can‚Äôt shoot him or I flag myself for PVP and full damage. He literally prevented me from progressing in the main story just by standing there.
---
You may think, ‚ÄúWhy not just leave the server and continue?‚Äù. And my answer for that is the quest has a high propensity to glitch when you quit out or get dropped from the game in the middle of it, not spawning in the quest items you may need or stopping the Master Sergeant from talking to you since it‚Äôs one of those quests you need to do in one go. 
---
So yeah, aside from that I‚Äôd say most people are nice. Fuck that guy with a sideways rake covered in acid, though. 
---
There are other things you can do?
---
Its a glitch. Last update said you will no longer loot AI weapons. Basically the enemies of the game have weapons equipped that we can't see, but they use on us.
---
+karma

It no longer spawns on Elaine. Here's how you obtain it.

This is what I‚Äôm doing tonight. Thanks!
---
Maybe Bethesda prepared these thing but did not yet "launch" them. Maybe they where not yet ment for us to find. Maybe people should try exploring the game themselfs instead of reading about all the stuff and then complaining about lack of things to do in the game.
---
Depends on your PC, usually you mash f8 or f12 while CPU is starting up. Need to see what button it is for your Mobo. Don't forget to check specs on your processor or you won't know what the clock speed is supposed to be.

Just go directly to the Glassed Cavern, you dont have to use the transmitters
---
The dead guy? Lol

Thanks for letting me know.
---
I just wish it would stop crashing or freezing when someone is about to drop a nuke and I can't get back to the server. I want to play the game but it keeps sh\*tting itself. I want to give it a chance but it is not helping. A lot of people don't like it because it is bug ridden.
---
Alright, I'll try it out later, thank you! Let's hope it works, this is getting on my nerves

Lmao this didn't age well

It's a unique from the event. I have 2 or 3 of em. There's a few weapons like that such as the meteorite sword

My husband has the mic on in the PS4 controller, and I'm too lazy to turn it off. I'm pretty sure the only thing is "Oh shit! Sorry!" A lot. I also never realized how much I talk to myself when I game until FO76.
---
Ah thanks,wasn‚Äôt to sure if I just got a one of a kind 
---
They haven't done it "yet". I'm not saying they will but that's one hell of a way to add immersion.

F.......

But why bulk steel? Honestly seems like a waste of plastic to me... I usually just drop steel since it is so common.

ok

World full

Just when I had almost completely lost faith in this game and haven't played it for a month and a half, they finally fix the bug that Caused me to have to make ammo about 25% more. Awesome! Now I might come back.
---
Mate market it and sell, there is players buying for loads
---
Tried the updated mods 
---
Yeah great idea, so dupers can hoard thousands of straight jackets and sell them on Ebay 
---
It's as important as the next long wall of drivel written praising the game on a long adventure they had doing this and that, it's great he's happy and wants to share it but that's all this sub honestly has been for months and it's just kind of disappointing to pretty much see these types of posts still being praised as if they're supposed to be good content for this sub. 
---
Juice boxes are more this kids style
---
Understood
---
Came back and share your journey!
---
Best questline in the game as of now.
---
Awesome!!!!
---
Unless you sorta spawn close by in the forest!
---
I gave a level 45 ish player a level 50 TSE 50 cal machine gun that I was hauling but never use.  It's decent, but I was just going to sell it anyway.  He looked in the bag, then gave me the thumbs up and started jumping.  Like actually jumping for joy, it made my whole week.

I can see the whole thing

‚ÄúAttention Vault 76! This is the Overseer.  The Super Duper Mega Mart after 25 years has opened. 8 floors of food, retail, hardware, and everything you could want. However the automated staff seem to have bugs in their system. They seem to have stocked the shelves with what ever they can find. The open hours are mere moments to them and they seem to confiscate all weapons and armour. If you want something your gonna have to work together to loot and fight your way through it. ‚Äú
---
Think of it as a Walmart. Every department known to man. You have to fight the construction crew, insects in the garden dept, so on and so forth. Each floor a unique named boss.  All while grabbing stuff off the shelves and mobs. Ranging from ghouls, scorched, bots.

No i like sawed off pistol grip pump with 32 rounds lol

When looking at the other titles and how this game apparently predates those. This was definitely a decision, among others, that was made without consideration for the boundaries within the franchise.

Fallout 4 at least made their songs which is nice.

With all that said, I'd still buy this version of

I wouldn't fool yourself too much. There are plenty of people that I have ran into that are completely content with shooting explosives at my camp for no reason other than that they are just complete assholes.

It's an awesome game, however this week is not it's shining moment. While the new update addressed many issues and is the beginning of the Wild Appalachia expansion, the new patch also brought new bugs with it. Thats not to say it's bad or going in the wrong direction, quite the opposite really, I'm just saying that some of the new issues that surfaced should have been caught and fixed before going public. That being said, it's great. I play daily and enjoy it, I can't wait  to get home from work to turn the game on. I play with coworkers and randoms and reddit users alike. Most players are friendly and helpful, however there *are* still shitty people out there that want to ruin someone's day. Just stash your junk often and don't let it get to you.
---
Good luck! 
---
&gt;Was he reminiscing about the good old days of bathing in the FEV tanks? 
---
FEV tanks don't exist yet and east coast mutants won't come from them, mutants in this game are a continuity error.
---
I assume the heavier the armor is, the more it makes you less stealthy. 
---
They certainly didn't prepare and not launch any of the other "puzzles" they've put in so far. If they weren't meant to be found, why would they be in the game? That makes no sense.
---
Nobody is complaining about the game being boring or not having anything to do. I personally have explored the entire map and am thoroughly enjoying the game still, with or without new content. 
---
Armor *weight* affects stealth. 
---
Survival mode and the prestige system coming soon will Alleviate it a little 
---
I played WoW a lot (not so much with BFA) and *constantly* seeing what was coming in the next patch/expansion months before it dropped took away all sense of wonder. Knowing Varian Wrynn dies months before the climactic finish took away an experience that would have completely broken me (well, even more than it did).
---
A bit off topic but does whitesprings farming even work this patch? As a routine member I know the drill but nothing seems to force a respawn anymore. Like exiting and entering the same server literally does nothing.
---
On my way! üèÉ

Good run guys üëç

It‚Äôs has literally nothing for singleplayer rpg fans, my man. Sorry to burst you fanboy asskissing fanfic here but try not to speak for other people next time.
---
It‚Äôs so dissimilar to singleplayer rpgs.
---
Upvoted. This makes me think that we need an official Flair for "Player Quests".
---
Like that guy that made himself a raid boss, or the murder house, and now this! Bethesda needs to let players host quests for each other.
---
Ha! I'm also trying to pick between those two colors.  I'm leaning toward blue. Your pic is definitely helping choose.
---
I wasn‚Äôt really implying anything has changed dramatically. I haven‚Äôt been following the DLC news closely and wasn‚Äôt sure how much new quest content was released with Wild Appalachia. 
---
I do believe people have mentioned this already, but I still wholeheartedly agree.
---
Well, about a week before that i was still on the river near sunshine meadows. I relocated to the river just south of the dam. But my power generator got destroyed by inhabitants. I tried making changes to my base so i could protect it better, but my poor building skills created some bugs and i had to tear it all down.
---
I decided to relocated further north. But not where i currently am. At first i was a bit more to the east. I tried to build there again and again. My mind was set in trying to use thoses metal staircases that don't stack properly unless using trick that create problems later on.
---
On the screen in my previous comment, we see my last iteration after i gave up using thoses staircases. It's not perfect. My first idea was to plant crops on the roof using the doormat trick. But, i had trouble doing it right and gave up.
---
If anyone has an answer can they reply to me, too?? Lol
---
When I Q'd for lead I started noticing it's in almost every child's toy too.  Funny!

Damage mitigation perks and armor
---
r/market76 r/fo76bazaar
---
So it's pretty much a widespread issue.  I think mine started happening around 3-4 weeks ago, does that sound about right for you? I managed to play for a long time without this happening.
---
Im having the same issue.
---
Log in today, first time since patch, and my camp is packed up. 
---
Fair enough I‚Äôm near a little bit, I‚Äôll just scooch over. Build it all back up again then relog to see how the demolished shrubs sit and the whole base got packed up again.
---
Nice build. The architecture in particular looks complicated, but well laid out.
---
Gotta lay off the nukashine my friend. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
A ... RadioShack?
---
They need to change it back to where you have to manually break it down.
---
Probably to do with the domes 
---
Hopefully this gets an answer because I'm rather curious about that also. I can't seem to find one anywhere. 
---
If he was standing still, then most likely sentinal assassin gear. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
All the ones I am finding in suits are 25% now.
---
Destroying peoples bases at the golf course and recording it and farming events hoping for a a gun with good legendaries 
---
He probably had armor with legendary effects like assassin's (-8% damage from players) and sentinel (-15% damage while standing still). One piece with both effects negates 23% of damage. Now imagine having multiple pieces of that armor. You can get to be damn near invincible. VATS crits can kill them though. 
---
Wish I had
---
Add a pressure plate and wire. That‚Äôs how I got mine to work
---
Had to server hop a few times but finally I got to the door AND IT WAS OPEN however the plan was still there... I'm confused
---
I‚Äôm kinda unfamiliar with using reddit, but it shows there are 4 post here but only see yours. 
---
I always buy mine at Bubbles' counter inside White Springs Resort.
---
Where did you find this?
---
Hot tub for the win... I wish 
---
I have a full set of unyielding wood armor. Installed the shrouded mod and I carry the set around when I feel like sneaking as opposed to sprinting. The pieces weigh nothing and boost sneaking speed to about regular walking speed. With over-repair, mutations, and perks, Dr/ER is around 350/350.
---
Also use the 'chemist' perk card (INT) for double the amount of chems that you craft.
---
I have mine setup so that the inside switch actually cuts power to the door... and the outside switch... which closes it. Out also makes it so that it cannot be opened from outside. 
---
That works as long as you always remember to turn it back on before you leave. 
---
How much for the bloodied hunting? Im online in 10hrs (12 o clock CET)
---
I had that too. I placed my camp in the same place about 4 times in a row. Any server hops would store it again. I placed it slightly further away and it's now stayed. Must still be slightly too close.
---
Dont remember If this worked or not. have you tried putting a switch on the inside maybe through a window. I'm thinking have the generator's power go to the inside switch and that switch can have a wire attached to the door switch. You may have to work with it to make it look decent. Just dont have a wire going from generator straight to the door switch outside 
---
From the outside, the door should open and close if the inside switch is on. From the inside the door should close once you cut the power using the inside switch.
---
A full set of Assassins gear will mitigate 40% of damage coming from players. Add Sentinel to the mix and it's unreal.
---
Were you still in passive?
---
Hahaha
---
Thanks! I wanted to try to make something more than just a square, but keep it in the realm of reality. I felt pretty lucky when things lined up for the upper garage area and for everything to connect. 
---
This happen long after I made these parts. I was actually putting in parts for another power armor in another frame when this happened
---
You are using the ‚Äúquick boy‚Äù view. Press the view button (the button across from the start button) to change it back to ‚Äúpip boy‚Äù view.
---
Every single time I try to do this, they run away. It's so frustrating. I'm just trying to give you free stuff!!!
---
Yeah got it in Massachusetts too
---
A friend, and I spent a few days in game looking for clues, and randomly trying codes until one of my crew either found it here, or on the forums. Not sure where she found it, or how her informant found it in game though. Figured I'd share it since some people haven't seen it yet, even if some ingrate tools want to complain about people being helpful lol.
---
Oh yeah, when you said two hearted that fish popped in my head. I don't really like it, remember trying that beer and it's way overpriced imo. Living in California, all we have is the general shermans ipa, not that great either but I still get it. I don't know if my opinion matters much though because I like dos equis lager!
---
Agree, same thing happened to me last night! Cost me a lot of junk including a good haul of screws
---
Im sure they weren't just a visual glitch as I did manage to scrap the extra pieces
---
Please no I already had my fill of Mothman encounters during Mothman week 
---
If you gave up on a game after 5 hours...probably not
---
Where does the game say this? Is it part of the 'Help' menu?
---
It's from taking his eggs! 
---
At this point I assume anyone that frequents here enjoys the game, it's not really a surprise given it's the subreddit. These kinds of threads have to go away at some point so an actual culture can develop.
---
I'm glad people like the game, but personally I'm over reading essays about them liking the game.
---
The problem with that is that if someone flips your outside switch while you‚Äôre inside then you‚Äôre stuck without going out a different exit or going into build mode. 
---
So does he.
---
I like to think I'm neutral.  
---
Met this level 42 guy down by the Watoga train station, he was using voice chat but I couldn't hear him. Kind of just ignored him before heading into the nuke zone someone had dropped on the nearby fissure site (Not the SBQ site), with the intention of visiting the Lucky Hole again.  
---
Turns out, he was following me, talking all the while without me hearing anything he said. We murdered our way through the area, killed a few Scorchbeasts (bloody things never want to come into Shotgun range), then went into the Mine. He followed me all the way through, looting and shooting and making good use of my willingness to run in and destroy anything that looked at him funny.  
---
I dropped a bag or two of looted items with no real value to me, he didn't seem to mind taking them anyway. Then we get back out of the cave, I'm on the brink of overencumbrance and warp back to my Camp. (Strange place on a cliffside, I am not an architect.) Never saw him again.  
---
Here's to you, chatty person whose name I do not remember. I hope you found someone to chat with.
---
I see that as well, I'm not sure but I would assume that's just how many people have clicked on it and looked at it more than actual replies 
---
Not a trustworthy company. We are all finding skeletons in preservation shelters.
---
The lights attach to the sides of the roof, so it's very difficult to place them in any way but along the top of the inside of a wall. Outside placement is possible by rotating the light to sink a little through the wall, but hanging them midair is not.
---
There is a way to farm them but theyre still really rare bcs basically noone knows. I have 115 of them though so if i were you i would probably try to sell it since its likely people will work out how soon
---
Hey, it protected them from The War! Why do you think they are still around? Not our fault none of you take food....
---
That's funny. Got it yesterday but had to race a guy to the door. He couldn't sprint so when opened it, got it and stabbed him a few times in pacifist before logging out.
---
In this case, yeah it seems trivial for steel but it has happened for several other things and it's the principal of the matter. 
---
It doesn't. It's a little known mechanic carried over from FO4. If you have questions about gear a lot can be found by searching through FO4 Google results. A lot of numberphiliacs and min/maxers did extensive research on FO4. FO76 uses a lot of the same mechanics, no all but a lot. 
---
Look, this game is like beer. Remember your first taste? Remember how awful it was? But now it's something you drink when it's time to relax, and it tastes really f-ing good. 
---
In this game there's an off-putting taste at first, but after some time you come to love it and spend all day at work longing for the moment you can come home and continue surviving. 5 hours isn't enough time to fully habituate to what this game really is... And the reward for sticking it out is phenomenal.
---
The radiation burns from exploring a blast zone after a nuke gets launched? Lol
---
but her solution wasnt actually helping people, her solution was becoming a raider herself. Thats why I rooted for the raiders to kill both of these fucks.
---
/r/fo76bazaar might be what you're looking for
---
Just south of the Wendigo Cave there is a lead ore deposit and a little bit.
---
Pre patch the hut had fire-cracker plants. They have gone and my camp was packed up. It let me build on the same spot but then it packed up again on relog.
---
True. They can max out at 99% damage reduction but that actually doesn't reduce their damage taken by 99%. A normal attack is probably only doing 5-15 damage per hit. A crit though will get through better and a nice sneak attack crit would still kill them.
---
Hmm. I would just remove the parts from the frame and then put them back on and continue your day.
---
Whacking and hacking and smacking...
---
You'll need to read what the terminal says and explore all your options on it. I've taken a lot of friends to start this quest because it's so cool, but they all struggle with the terminal because they don't read any of the entries. Depending on what part of it you're at you'll need to do various things like log in on other user names.
---
Thanks
---
I really loved that one a lot. It was too expensive to fast travel anywhere, though. Now I'm on the cliff overlooking the Bog. I like it there, too. But that Seneca Rocks spot is special for sure. 
---
Seems to be the case.
---
They need to fix it. I can‚Äôt be bothered to engage with the camp system if my camp can just dissappear
---
I mean i think if you just build away from major locations youll be fine
---
Just south of Wendigo cave bears little hut and a lead deposit.
---
Sorry for your loss, but you should have stashed it... I know the feels tho bro. 
---
It also kinda sounds like he's "whacking it" in the chorus.. just saying. I still laugh when it comes on though. It's something my friends and I reference quite often just for laughs.
---
Probably wouldn't matter.. people would figure out how to abuse it in some matter. "oops, stabbed you in the face.. sorry. I really didn't mean it.".. "whoops, I did it again, that's weird. really, really sorry."  \*stab, stab, stab, stab\*.." April Fools!.. I'm stabbing you on purpose and now you are dead.. ha ha!!". 
---
Thank you for doing the lord‚Äôs worküëçüòÇ
---
It is my ringtone lol
---
It's not exactly how it works but yes it can make a player practically immune (similar to slap damage) to non-crits / sneak attacks.
---
My husband got this message, rebuilt his camp in the middle of nowhere (waaaaaaaaaaaay down in the south of the map), logged in today and got the message again. He's literally around nothing.
---
It's pretty frustrating and it seems like it must be some kind of bug.
---
I‚Äôm far enough away from the nearest location for it not to be an issue..

And if that distance is an ssue I‚Äôm gonna have to get tape measure and start measuring minimum safe distances

That's true. Really sad isn't it?

If that was the case it wouldnt have opened the OP up to pvp damage after the attack.

Neither is DLC, atomic points, or fallout 76 though.. they aren't paying for a new game engine so... I feel like they could afford 5 or 10 more songs.. especially if they sell it to us.

---
You‚Äôre allowed to disagree, but only who you are as a person allows you to be a douchenozzle about it. The devs deserve to hear when they‚Äôve taken a step in the right direction, and people deserve to enjoy things. If you think I‚Äôm an asskissing fanboy you obviously missed all the negative points and my break from the game I pointed out. If your goal was to convince me to take down my article and change my recommendation to others, you failed to make any sort of intelligent observation whatsoever. If your goal was to be an asshole to a stranger on the internet having a difference of opinion than yours, congratulations, you succeeded.

Hamsters need feeding.

What's TNT?

I just have 1 switch on the inside. When I am away the door stays open so others can use the crafting stations. If I need a door between me and something I can go inside and flip the switch.
---
Yeah they haven't fixed saved favorites either, one of the basic ui issues that's more annoying than anything. I have no idea who is beta testing the game but he's got to be in the filthy casual sub xD Had a couple more annoying bugs that have to do with guns but I'm sure they know about those.
---
It does sounds like nukashine.
---
It should have a quest marker telling you what to do

Awesome! Btw still want those tokens?

The auto-save is default to 10 minutes.  Change the setting in the Fallout76Custom.ini file.

Nobody said its important nor is there a rule saying only important things can be posted. Guy had a fun times and wanted to share that. There is nothing wrong with that. 
---
I'm on PC and crashing if I'm in my inventory while taking a mission from Biv. I just crashed while trying to complete a mission to brew Rad ant something. This is a consistent bug and can easily be replicated by my friends. Step one: talk to Biv after brewing what he wants. Step 2: open inventory. Step 3: congrats, you crashed. 
---
No probs mate anytime u need something bit me up i might have it
---
Awesome work love it 
---
Apparently not.
---
The funny thing about this game is that when people get bored in most games they start griefing. In FO76 when players get bored they help new players.
---
That is good advice...when i was level 11 a level 108 player killed me and waited for me to come for my stash. Killed me two more times and thats when i just gave up and let him have my stash.
---
Why is this so hard for the devs? I mean that honestly. This seems like one of the most obvious and basic features possible. Does anyone with database knowledge know why they‚Äôre slacking on this?
---
The fasnatch event? Idk if they‚Äôve already implemented it
---
Yes it still happens with power armor. I had it happen today on me. No crash just plain old put a set in my stash and later I had 2 copies. Something was up though because I could not put both copies out on the ground at the same time. However, I was able to scrap 1 and the other was just fine.

From someone that has no skin in the game and no interest in PvP - the only legendary damage reduction/damage bonus that should process for PvP is Assassin's.  Yup - even your legendary weapons - no Instigating, no Bloodied, no Two Shot, just Assassin's!
---
Side door is the way to go. The pressure plate would work too but it looks like hell.

If the guns didn't fucking suck for no real reason then I'd play. The gun damage is so out of whack in this title.

Lay that pistol down. I've been playing it solely as a single player RPG and enjoying it as much as any other Fallout game (and more in some ways).

Even in workshop contests, since when did a deathclaw gauntlet get that op? Fkr in a top hat 1-shot me tonight just after I finished building. They were waiting for me to finish. Assholes.

Or just do it to unsuspecting low levels until they flee the server and you have to find the next one ü§£

Totally agree. I have a hard enough time getting 5 levels a week, 3 in a day? Come on I got stuff to do IRL, too. 
---
Sounds like you used a few tricks that the CAMP building blueprint rules don't like. That's why the blueprints were messed up. Curved wall trick?
---
I don't like about ever even look at them.

Well it sure as hell didn‚Äôt work
---
I've  got a pretty hearty stack of healing salves simply because my camp has access to WAY too many bloodleaf and soot flower spawns. I drop them at the Overseers camp and Flatwoods frequently.

There is, it's just harder than The Forest. You need Sap which is harder to find.

Why do you think that?

I hear you, but I never "gave up" on it. (If I had, I wouldn't have bothered with the post. ;-)  )

I was getting crashes constantly, and just figured I would put it on the shelf for a bit while they worked shit out, ya know?

On point my man, there‚Äôs nothing more to say lol

I‚Äôm not even going to try for this until the hype dies down.

First, get each switch powered. Second, there's a long conduit pipe with the wire connector in the middle and the pipe curves at both endes...  place this piece so the wire connector sticks out of the garage door, but the curved ends inside.
---
At this point it should start clicking for you.
---
Omg how please? This looks like amazing fun.

I'm not having maintenance

Love this post! lol

Thx for the feedback pheakel

&gt; After you beat the game

Still don't understand that.

That would be so great.

No. You'll find getting the key annoying.

Did the quest but can't use friends fermenter

Did it get attacked my someone?

Whoa there Satan, calm down.

Hmm, it isn‚Äôt *terrible,* but could be higher!

Thx for the feedback Littleshadow.
---
Ya know, for all the talk I've read on the forum over the past few months about assholes, I never really ran into anyone who gave me any grief. Of course, I really don't have near enough time into the game to really make a judgement call on it either way. lol
---
I did meet some really nice people who offered to help me out though, which was really cool!
---
Of course!
---
Just be patient. I server hopped 20+ times yesterday, just trying to get the key. This morning i got ot first try. 
---
The hullabaloo will die down, and you'll get it easily.

I'm sure Bethesda will be happy to oblige...for 50,000 atoms.

There's a mod that'll fix it if you happen to play on PC.

Idk man, those spotlights probably killed some eyes üòÅ

I've been using the enclaive brought from trader for monts now, but thought about trying others. Like with unyielding the enclaive one is pointless. And maybe I don't need that extra 10 carry capasity as much as something else like vats related.

My western revolver does this time consuming elaborate loading animation every time I log in. Not the greatest if you find yourself engaged in a skirmish on initial spawn. After the initial loading flourish the reloading for the western is quick and no nonsense.

It sucks. Drink, eat spoiled food until you get sick, then wait to get better. Don't take disease cure or antibiotics like I did, or you'll have to eat more spoiled food and get sick again. That, or server hop until the quest changes to "Test your Strength" or one of the others.

I think they'd be really gamey, with that nuclear waste afters taste. You know, kinda burney.

So how do you tell what mechanics have and haven't carried over? How'd you find out that armor weight was a factor? Just trial and error?

What you described is what i really like about the mainline story, as lackluster as it may be. In previous fallouts, your quest is almost always "determine the future of the wasteland by siding with these people or being a lone wolf" and while it's sort of the same in 76, in previous fallouts you were dropped smack in the middle of the action, where the player can actually make a difference and change future events. Here, your situation is simply a matter of right place, wrong time. You and your fellow vault dwellers could have been the heroes that step in to save West Virginia from the scorched plague, fighting alongside Brotherhood soldiers, responders, or even raiders. Here, you do get to do that, but now it's with your other dwellers. You weren't given the choice of stepping in at the right moment, you were dropped into this world when it was already too late, and all you can do now is finish what they started.

Yes trial and error. Plus I do a lot of research myself when not playing. I'm not quite as good at compiling and presenting information as others are, but it's out there. Some things may take more digging than others.

Is it just tse 2* I'd say conservatively worth 5 to 8k if ¬≥* with a good 3rd perk then 10k plus easy
---
ü§∑ Griefer is an Achievement too haha
---
Entirely correct.  I didn't put the thought into it to do better.  I've seen double powered setups before... but that has issues closing. 
---
At some point I just said "good enough".
---
You can arrange a switch that can be reached through a window for entry control.   Kinda gimmicky but it works from inside or out. 
---
Without some kind of logic gate there's no way to have full control from both sides. 
---
What building plans are those? It looks like wood paneling?
---
Hank Williams the third has a lot of songs about the Whites I feel like they need included
---
I have ten of each type except gourds I keep only five. I do only have five crappy turrets but I don't need them. My house looks nice though.
---
It's open because someone else already unlocked it.
---
"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn‚Äôt stop to think if they should. "
---
I know that, the problem is the door appears as locked I‚Äôm looking for a way to fix that 
---
Greenbrier Valley Brewing is the best brewery in WV.  Their Devil Anse IPA is my favorite "new" beer I've tried over the past 2-3 years.  And the mothman is not far behind.  So refreshing on tap and still delicious in cans.
---
It‚Äôll sell really quickly and probably for a decent price, I‚Äôd go for it myself but out of my price range atm. Might want to mention what platform and also check on bazaar. 
---
 That's how mine is setup. But your screwed of you fast travel with the inside switch off and out of reach, and have to travel or build if someone comes by and flops the outside switch while you're inside. 
---
I just deal with it... to much bother you try and putt together a complete solution. 
---
Thanks you reminded me to add what pistols are normally used for, ‚Äúa light weight side arm to kill low levels‚Äù 
---
Just like in real life,barrel length has nothing to do with the length of the magazine.Ive seen pump shotguns with the mag longer than the barrel and vise versa.
---
Same here. I think I live near you. Got a lakeside mountain camp between white springs and watoga and the view is spectacular. The enemies aren't particularly numerous so I have a rather peaceful home base.
---
I read that they plan on telling players make radio stations eventually.
---
No it‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs glitched because I can‚Äôt open the door to the dome
---
Because that's how it works in real life.  The tube underneath the barrel is the magazine. Make then barrel (and that tube) shorter/longer and it will have an effect on ammo capacity. 
---
I think on the vendor thats all the way north on the map I forget the name, but its in between the ammo factor and the amusement park 
---
Which event is this?
---
mmoga.com is 15,38$
---
Oh, sorry. That sucks!
---
dude, seriously, why is there no super duper mart!  I mean there is one but it's not a dungeon full of loot...
---
I'm stuck on getting the damn series. All the ghouls there are 30 levels over mine
---
Wall decorations same tab as the lit nuka cola and space kitten posters I think. Not 100% but that where I‚Äôd look first.
---
Yeah, Mothman is good, but Devil Anse is awesome. 
---
I think it's the breach and clear quest in the ash heap region
---
Weird, all I had to do was eat spoiled food and it completed 
---
Yeah me too. Thanks brah, i appreciate the support.  Better than Bethesda's. I keep crashing with an error 1.1.0 and Bethesda says that there is no error 1.1.0 even after I sent them
---
594ieri383 is 333 screenshots. I kicked out of the game 5 times with this error on the day of the Nukashine  questline went live. I don't get it. I got pics and they still say that error doesn't exist. I am just about ready to stop playing altogether. 
---
do tell me about this one near the VTU, thought the only one was in Watoga...
---
In nothing but my birthday suit, strapped with my trusty hatchet, I embarked. I spawned just north of the Charleston train station, and went north for some ice cream. Had to deal with some angry customers there. Crossing the bridge going east I dealt with some serious road rage from the other travelers. I discovered some dirty commie robots at my local water treatment facility, easy work there. As I passed the Top of the World, I ran into some high level scorched, I had to nope right the hell out of there. And at the ski resort, just north west of my camp, the level 10-15 super mutants must have power leveled REAL fast as I saw a level 10 become a level 68. The second noping of my adventure. Finally made it back to camp with enough food and water bar to not have needed to drink my stuff. 
---
Totally gonna get my friends to do this with me and see what trouble we can get into. 
---
It's a glitch. I've happened upon the door multiple times and it was closed, but it would open when I pressed without a key. No plans. Someone opened it and either closed it when they left or the game just closed it eventually but it had already been accessed. Only way to tell is to enter and look for the plan
---
i built a camp a earlier today then had it disappear due to the new update, even tho the update was days ago
---
Touch√©. You got me there, good grief. 
---
I only ate one spoiled food as well and it completed. 
---
CHR is 9
---
Question: why are you here?
---
You did by saying its nothing and not important. 
---
Individual servers are taken down all the time for maintenance. Usually when they've been up and running a long time. 
---
Ignore my post below, I clearly misunderstood the question. Lmao
---
I‚Äôll get my coat.
---
I.. actually found it on my own and found the quantum post when I googled what it's for. So yeah no, people find everything there is to find.
---
Quick question, is X0-1 the best PA you can get? 
---
And where‚Äôd you find the plans? 
---
Don't feel bad. Everytime I go there, all the furniture objects are invisible 
---
I remember my first death came from similar circumstances - another player was down and I went over to Stimpack him, and wound up smashing him in the face with a hammer instead.  It was a learning experience.  He killed me, but didn't take my stuff, which showed me exactly what I stood to lose whenever I died.  And also why Pacifist Mode is a good idea. üòã
---
But yeah, "LOL" and "Sorry" are probably the two big emotes we need.
---
I never bought the whole "music never evolved" thing. There's gotta be some Hendrix or a copy of Sgt Pepper somewhere in the wasteland.
---
This community can't figure out basic mechanics.
---
That would be pretty funny.
---
Thanks! I was worried that my account might had one of those rare glitches that only one out of a million players get
---
&gt;What really blew my mind was discovering that we end up being the original mysterious strangers
---
Not really. The mysterious stranger already exists in 76. 
---
Your fine I got it
---
That would definitely be a useful addition. Good thinking Batman.
---
I don't agree! Harvesting some plants is half the fun
---
Good job! I still remember when I built my excavator suit pre-nerf! So many springs haha
---
You can draw your conclusions where you see fit but I didn't say there was anything wrong with it. 
---
You get X-01 plans at the Whitespring Bunker when you unlock the armory.
---
thanks for the pep talk, Todd.
---
Ah thanks man, is that part of a quest line? 
---
You mean Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson, Dolly Parton, and Lester Flatt. If you want a Cash it's going to have to be June Carter.
---
The best story arc in the game.
---
Yeah it'll be when you learn about using nukes and stuff. :)
---
No worries, Cheers! 
---
1. X0-1 is the second best for damage resistance right behind the Ultracite powerarmor 
---
2. You can get the plans by going through the enclave quest line once you get into the white springs bunker you will unlock an area within the bunker after getting all the comedations and on a terminal you can find the plans 
---
( sorry for my bad spelling and explaination )
---
Are you dumb? Like generally dumb. 
---
Sigh, I still try to give my recipes to players I come across when they are low level. I flag/emote them, run up to them and start dropping my recipes and when I leave the screen they server hop :( 
---
damn.  you got me good
---
No that‚Äôs brilliant thankyou! How do you get the Ultracite?
---
I‚Äôm currently level 55 and gone more of the side quest route as opposed to the main ones. 
---
True but that would be a lucky respawn lol I would just drink another and try again 
---
Bucks Den I'm pretty sure (the Nightstalker place).
---
I ended up going with blue. But everytime I see my two friends that I did the purple lamp for I always end up questioning my decision... lol.  Blue is at least the most useful as out of the two colors. 
---
probably because it sounds like a madman talking.
---
I had to do Freak easys junk guide after this here is the link -   https://youtu.be/7E-4rfeajBM
---
At least increase rewards if you are going to make us do 10 times more work now.
---
Not trying to getcha, just saying the whole canvas bag uproar was petty.
---
I picked my spot at level 5 or so based on having a northern fast travel point and because the lights at night are so pretty. I haven‚Äôt moved it yet and I‚Äôm 50+ now. I couldn‚Äôt get stairs to work either and for some reason fast travel always puts me at the bottom of the cliffs no matter how I move around my camp thingy. It‚Äôs small and cozy and feels like home. 
---
We desperately need plantable plots or planters. I‚Äôve got dirt on the slopes below me but it‚Äôs not flat and half my crops won‚Äôt even plant properly. At least nothing bothers my stuff there. 
---
Ahh the simple art of misdirection let this be a lesson to you keep your eye on the prize.
---
Main quest
---
You can get instantly killed though. With a full set of life saving armor, you rarely ever die permanently, with 5 50% rolls to get up after death.
---
Excellent. That is why I do what I do - love matching people up with that weapon that fills a void in the loadout!
---
so was Nuka Dark,  both were quality, as advertised, products
---
So you could in theory 'beat the game' by finishing only the main quest and leave the rest for later.
---
Thanks for reading, Kevin 
---
Finish the brotherhood quest line you should get it after you finish the quest ‚Äúbelly of the beast‚Äù I haven‚Äôt done it yet because I don‚Äôt have time but there‚Äôs a lot of scorched and a scorchbeast in that quest but the scorchbeast fight should be easy because he‚Äôs in a cave so he can‚Äôt fly as much so beat him with a super sledge or something 
---
When I was like lvl 20, I had several PA chassis and not enough space in my stash. I'd find a lower level player, chase them down and try to emote and point until they picked up the chassis. Pretty sure I scared the crap out of people. Hahaha
---
Thanks! 
---
[Counter point to gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AmyKEKCA18). Secondly, people that are overly dependent on sentinel gear are easily killed if you know how to do it. In fact, the best counter to it requires no legendaries and just proper speccing. A friend of mine's build is essentially a sentinel/cavalier destroyer and his main weapon is a 1 star weapon. No legendary armor required.
---
But yes, I'd agree the loot system is quite broken as of last patch.
---
Can't anymore! I just noticed it today. :(
---
Well when you beat other RPG games like Pokemon you still have lots to do after you defeat the elite 4 (the hardest guys to beat)
---
After a loonnnnggggg, maddening night with no success and someone stealing my key, before I could round the corner to the secret door, I finally got it. I woke up at 7am and ran the whole thing, starting at Nuka and got it first time. Hang in. 
---
Absolutely. 50 cal is my favorite too and flash fern make her happy üòÇ
---
I found it a couple of days ago when I realised you could climb up that thing, which I was previously unaware of. 
---
good armor tends to be harder to find than good weapons. The problem is you usually need specific armor because most people will spec their build to the weapon. The armor has to fit the build rather while most fit their build to the weapon. At least that was my attitude 
---
If ur on xbox I sell beer at my bar :)
---
Full auto critical pistol was disgusting in terms of DPS. I was doing 2300 DPS until they nerfed critical hits. I still can do 1900 DPS after the nerf though. A pistols‚Äô main strength is low AP cost. Stack sneak attacks, head shots, and critical hits and that wimpy 50 damage pistol starts hitting for 200-300 damage per bullet. Unfortunately, like I said, they nerfed critical hits for full auto weapons, so the gap between bloodied and melee grows ever more.
---
The main thing we need is stagger chance. Before the critical hit nerf, we could burn down sentinel users easily. Now that only one bullet is a critical hit, we have no way to kill these people without a gamma gun.
---
Yesterday I had problems with this user "TacocatRacer". He and his friends insulted me continuously and it is not the first time that happens to me.
---
Oh, it's modded textures for the brick set, courtesy of [ACME - Assorted Camp Modifications Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/253) by Rigell on the FO76 Nexus.
---
Thanks everyone we found some
---
sent ya a friends
---
I was just thinking the same thing earlier today when I had got on earlier than I normally do, and had nothing to do.
---
Everyone down voting this doesn't seem to understand that any stagger or crit will defeat sentinel. You can't have sentinel and chameleon at the same time, so you literally have to just sit there and be a bullet sponge hoping no one throws on enforcer, one gun army, or drops a crit
---
I hope not.  Nothing like waking up in a strange place, especially a roof or high plateau.  Lol
---
Delicious, delicious corn and rice water.
---
Report the hell outta them. Bethesda has straight up ignored a full hour of their stream sniping and server hopping to chase me down shenanigans.
---
Especially after the latest patch it became more laggy when I spawn, the pump shotgun reload is just painful since it has to load eight times, sometimes it just paused there I thought it‚Äôs gonna crash. 
---
Unfortunately not. If you even try to drop the armor, it will destroy it.
---
So your Rank 5 card just vanished?
---
Didn't you mention you have a 4460? The processor's multiplier is locked, so there's no way it can be overclocked. I highly doubt your motherboard would be able to overclock a locked processor, unless it for some reason pushes the BLCK frequency up. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Perhaps giving more specs would help us all out, whats your motherboard model? PSU? Is there a bluescreen or a straight up freeze? You can check Windows event viewer for any system errors. 
---
I dont care about the reloading as much as I was the movement speed boost to working properly. That's the mail reason I took the mutation
---
yes I hope not either it should have the negative of the blackout as powerful as it is
---
Amazon has "used" keys for $26. Generally damaged box, key not actually used. I got mine from there for $23, so if you're patient price may go back down.
---
Yup. If they decide to cut westek off too, my hope for a descent 3* will be lost. I don't pvp or plan to pvp but I try to be stronger or be able to do more things with my build.
---
Low good item drop rates are never a good thing unless farm period is under few 1-2 minutes. Right now fo76 is like an eastern mobile gacha game but it takes a good week to get at least one good item.
---
I seriously feel bad for everyone trying to get the NCQ paint job, I got the paint job the 2nd day it was out. I got the key second try and the paint job after a few server hops. Now it seems as if it is almost impossible for anyone to get it.
---
Guys good new I got it 
---
It's all fun and games until the level 5 wakes up with a monster hangover in a deathclaw nest!
---
How is that possible, I‚Äôm in x01 and the purple lamp makes everything looks like flash fern lol üòÇ
---
I have never had anything but bad luck with the string lights. I had to scrap my entire camp because a set snapped wrong and couldn't be re-selected. now I have a set stuck in my floor. good luck!  
---
Fuck. I forgot about that farm. Got 140+ corn from there once.
---
That‚Äôs a good point for the OP, and I forgot that I‚Äôm my other response. When we were on a team we completed the medic achievement by reviving back and forth, then we left the team and killed each other back and forth to get the grief achievement. Got both achievements in 10 minutes or less.
---
Well rested bonus disappears after relog
---
Yes, i report and block him and his friends. What's him twich username? Sorry my bad English, i speak spanish ussually.
---
I got got the plan from an opened door... Never got any cards of keys. 
---
...Did you read anything other than the title?
---
Easy way to solve this have us spawn inside the whitesprings instead of outside. 
---
lol quite possible bots. Anyone with a functioning brain should understand the implication of this. Bethesda is making the robbery of virtual currency a reality. 
---
It's happened to me about 20-30 times already.. about half of those times, I lost all junk I was carrying. There could be a spawn outside of nuke zone fix, or a way to pre-load the world during the loading screen ahead of time (like almost every other online game), so there isn't a weird frozen lag for 30 seconds.
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
If you die it cancels it
---
It functions like a cooking station, not designed for scrapping.   
---
I don't see the keywords that block SuperDuper, could be bad luck?
---
I don't know, he has 20 of them.
---
I can 100% get behind this. But, would that only apply to whitesprings? Because nukes can be detonated anywhere's on the map correct? ( I have never launched one myself)
---
Naw, i gave up after 15 mins
---
hey, i need to complete the event to get the decon arch.  would you mind messaging me when you get a team together again.  im only lv 69 but i can take out the adds pretty easily
---
Some new songs in general would be really nice. I'd love some more Crosby. 
---
For those of you that just want to listen to your regular music, you can like, just listen to regular music. It's easy. 
---
Well everyone else complains when the sub is full of toxic negativity so you can‚Äôt please everyone I suppose :)
---
Lmao. The people at Bethesda either don't play their game or just don't give a shit. How can I come back after a 3 month content drought and get 20 minutes into the quest, and already have to server hop because nobody thought about the quest design? Now I'm loading in and out trying to get corn to spawn to play a game that runs like garbage.
---
Are you quite certain this is the issue?  Because I have built twice now and am quite determined to get it to work.  Both times I moved my C.A.M.P bench..
---
Maybe I try log out and in again without building anything this time... 
---
Yup. Just got it again for my bf. Seems like no one on PS4 is going after it... 
---
yes
---
That's normal. Ultracite is too rare for us to get extra. 
---
Been there a couple times neighbour. Had to make a habit of logging out in PA just in case because it got too painful watching myself irradiate to death spawning into WS yet again. Only time I don't bother is at Camp because it's in the middle of nowhere, but even then I do it outta habit half the time
---
all my sneak perks seems broken....only does the x2 damage, but crouched or not ennemy see me
---
sigh...
---
I've never had trouble finding them until I needed them for Biv's quest.
---
I've tried going there during Heart of the Swamp, after Heart of the Swamp, at night, at day... Plenty of strangler pods there; none of them are blooming. 
---
Guess it's one more thing to server hop for. Yay.
---
People don't wanna learn counters they'd rather just cry. I have a friend that litterally just pain trains into a fire axe swing to kill sentinal and cavalier people. I just have a 1 star bloodied lvl 40 hunting rifle and I just am critical heavy so if they aren't stealth boying around I can easily just critical them through their sentinal
---
Thank you much!
---
üëÄ
---
I mean... technically it works. (:
---
GTA:O has done player made games rather well, I would like to see what /u/LoneVaultWanderer would come up with if they could make a player quest!
---
Maybe make the name attached to a certain piece ie: helmet so excavator pa (full set), raider pa (4 pcs of t-45 but the helmet is raider). Or maybe by most amts of same armor (same armor as above would be t-45 pa).
---
I think it‚Äôs intended.  There are a number of things super duper doesn‚Äôt work on.  
---
Deathclaws need some Nukashine before fun can be had, don't want to remember that night!
---
Poo poo pee pee. Dookie rookie 
---
I wear assassins sentinal with one leg of chameleon sentinal.
---
One day I will drop my 50 all on a server and make all ppl wanted...
---
I‚Äôve only seen one post about the Quantum paint and it was definitely tagged Spoiler. Everything I‚Äôve seen posted about data mining has either had the term in the title which should be clue enough, or it‚Äôs marked Spoiler. Even if it wasn‚Äôt, you‚Äôd have to read the title then continue to open the post. Read a brief description of what the post is about, which was basically ‚Äúhey here‚Äôs a paint click this link to find out how to get it‚Äù, THEN CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE LINK AND WATCH THE VIDEO. This, to any logical human being, is completely idiotic. To have somehow reached the full peak of this scenario against your own will is unbelievable and any person to have done so must be burdened with a genuine stunt in their mental capacity. Proceeding to complain about it on the internet like it‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs fault is on a whole different level.
---
Other people‚Äôs knowledge of the puzzle has no bearing over you doing it yourself or with a group/organized post. Either way, the clues that were left for you to follow were slim to none, and honestly, you‚Äôd have almost the same odds at figuring it out by yourself than with the whole world jerking the same circle. But besides that, you could‚Äôve literally just not read and watched everything the post and comments provided, you would‚Äôve been fine. Curiosity killed the cuck.
---
I just can't see any other time that I would spawn inside a nuke zone other then whitesprings. Or if I lived down by the bog. 
---
There just be a message like the "cant place your camp" message.

So when you benefit from one you don't benefit from another. Both are never active at the same time

That's... way more practical and actually probably doable.

Watoga north side follow the water like ten spots .

Na im good I got like 400

You sure ? I was protecting my friends base today crouching invisible on the roof and got hit with a explosive dragon and lost almost no health
---
Hey man, i know its been ages but i know how to get them finally
---
I didn't change any settings, game works great.
---
Incorrect. The forced evolutionary virus (FEV) was actually sent to vault 87 (this was a separate strain from the west coast) which if you played fallout 3 you would know this. Vault 87 was located in DC and the test subjects escaped in 2078 / 2080 ish? Fallout 76 takes place in 2102. So there was plenty of time for super mutants to spread to West Virgina. 
---
The Nukashine Challenge, I like it.
---
Ugh, I have a rifle build and all I get are melee and armor legendaries. I haven't found anything useful in like 40 levels. Level 70 and still running around with a vanilla handmade. Lucky I got hardened off my second scrap after getting the plans. I did luck out with the marsupial thingy though, that is super fun.
---
Strong with the Dark Side this one is....
---
üòÅüëç
---
I'm in PC
---
no mods, completely new install, thing gets more broken every update :(
---
I also have a set with one piece of chameleon sentinel on one of my builds. This has always been the case. If you don't believe me, have a friend test it.
---
I've tried going there during Heart of the Swamp, after Heart of the Swamp, at night, at day... Plenty of strangler pods there; none of them are blooming.
---
I was waiting for someone to post this!  My friend has a base near Seneca rocks and we built the spike trap to launch from.  She made it clear to the far northwest corner of the map, over Aaronholt.  So much fun!
---
Same,  I have a .44 for that...
---
Yeah you gotta have a strategy, melee and heavy gunners for mass DPS, shotgunners to cripple her and make her stay on the ground longer, ranged weapons to shoot her wings while she‚Äôs hovering so she lands more often. Once you get a good team together it‚Äôs almost too easy. 
---
Fought her twice today and finished her with 17 minutes left each time, no min maxing just everyone pulling their weight and sticking to the plan. What system do you play on? 
---
Yes. Your idea is horrible. You want to be able to claim a workshop because the owner isn‚Äôt there and expect to have nerfed damage and no consequences.  
---
I got a random daily from Camden today.  There are days where I get one at Camden, and days where I don't.  It has been this way for me for months.  I started the Nukashine quest this morning, and about 8 hours later, I got the daily.
---
Absolutely! I'm fast traveling to Big Al's right now! I'm gonna drink nukashine and play the piano until I black out. 
---
I'm hoping this will be an interesting Saturday night.
---
 Okay so bare with me here. First off, I recommend reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), the OP is an absolute hero, who has worked with this engine modding and ect. since skyrim, and fallout 4 as well.
---
For a TDLR, delete your current preset files from config (under my games fallout 76 generally) with the game turned off. Then boot up the game, Select Full-screen, and the Medium graphics preset. Then from there you can change some settings like textures, however make sure **shadow distance is set to low**, and **DO NOT TOUCH ANY FADE SLIDERS**.
---
Once you've done that, if your getting solid frame-rates and want a graphical improvement, go ahead and check out [this reshade](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234) by the same guy. I found that I actually got less stuttering in general with this, however my righ might slightly outclass yours, in which case just stick with the setting changes. If you're in game and your GPU still has around 30-40% usage left, that's when I'd recommend using this reshade.
---
Basically, the presets for High and Ultra aren't meant for 60fps gaming, they're there for cinematography and ect. The OP of that post I linked explains how the medium preset for fallout 76 actually sets values higher than ultra fallout 4, to put it in perspective. So when you're using the medium preset, then for instance upping texture quality to ultra, you're getting the same visual experience as running it on the ultra preset, except ultra runs in general 15-30 fps slower ESPECIALLY in places like harper's ferry.  
---
If you're reading all that and are still confused as to what to do or why, the OP of the Post I linked made this YouTube video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHT35fWCuQc&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHT35fWCuQc&amp;feature=youtu.be) That pretty much goes over everything.
---
Hope this helps man, I've dropped the same knowledge bomb like 5 times in 3 days, thinkin' this stuff needs to be in a sticky thread.
---
reposted from earlier this week
---
Personal, rifleman trying to deal with the adds. Normally rely on people to join due to not having a solid group to play with.
---
So is it that the sent doesn't work while crouching ? Ya I'll have to just test it :p
---
üëç
---
Or we like to play the game instead of building √§n idiotic turret house 
---
Sound logic. I was just thinking the same thing. Not to the extent of post but. Very good ideas. 
---
I guess I do have dodgy and serendipidy maybe that's why I didn't take any dmg
---
I started playing today. Accidentally looted some level 60's airdrop. Managed to flee back to the overseers camp dropped off all my crap and stood in the water waiting to die (not realising that rads continue after you die). They put me out of my misery. Then waited at the overseers camp and gave me some stimpacks, a radaway and some other junk. Was great i'm really liking the community. 
---
North of Johnsons Acre and near a BOS base?  I loved camping there.  Great place. 
---
You nailed it perfectly.  
---
Yeah I really wish they'd fix this weapon, and maybe add mods. It's one of my favorites, so it sucks that it can use all your cells if you're not careful...
---
I have a quad one that I would really like to see charge up to 20x damage

I appreciate your post a lot! Thank you! This wont get me banned? Im just worried because i saw some posts about people getting banned using reshades. What do you think about RAW Mouse input? 
---
I was thinking of doing this too. Can you imagine if we got a couple of people to do it all at once? Filling the skies with vertibots and that red smoke? It‚Äôd probably crash the servers. 
---
...No, I want to prevent griefers from abusing the system to initiate PVP and then relentlessly hunt somebody across the world until they've drained all their caps. I never claim owned workshops.
---
Seriously, read the post...
---
Yeah that's all it is. 
---
I was following the tips posted on reddit, none of them worked. I server hopped 20 times and eventually I found them blooming at Dyer chemical. It was during the day, which is contrary to everything I read. 
---
Complete and utterly random, that's what sucks about it.
---
No problem 
---
Good to hear I'm not just out to lunch haha. I love the game and just want it to be balanced while still giving players willing to grind and work for their gear a reward. 
---
Seeing as the game does this when loading. Can‚Äôt there be a warning when loading. Same as how it does warning you about your camp. 
---
Yeah most people are really helpful. There are a few assholes out there. Word of advice, if anyone wants you to follow them into their base make sure there aren‚Äôt any pressure tiles on the floor. It‚Äôs a trap you won‚Äôt be able to escape. 
---
But there's really only so much building to fit a weapon you can do. Because some of the legendary weapon effects make them far better than just some of the percentage more damage ones. Like I have a Gatling that is 50 percent more limb and 30 percent more against ghouls. It's great for nukes at whitespring and most other things, but it uses a lot of ammo against bigger enemies. I think it does 135 base damage. 
---
We could make it a filthy casual thing! Like we can offer quests to people. I love doing things like that, I do it with clan mates in other games too.
---
Just start a post with [Player Quest] and see who does it! 
---
White springs is always nuked because the amount of creatures that spawn in and put up a fence around crops 
---
I use armor piercing hardened handmade sniper modded and a zealots high speed power fist.
---
Picked it up again after a month or so hiatus after playing...maybe 300 hours?  Feels like they did some tweaking again.  Couldn't drop super mutants with an entire magazine of 10mm from my 2-shot submachine gun.  +Crit Western Revolver wasn't doing much better.  Was doing the "Always Diligent" event and it felt like a chore instead of fun because the enemies were so damn spongey.
---
I've enjoyed my time with the game but it's still not quite baked yet.  Needed another year I think.
---
Or.. and I know this is going to to sound like a radical and controversial solution, switch from team to area for a sec, and use your mic to apologise. Just sayin'
---
You can't lock your crops. But you can leave some dirt on the inside of your house and lock the front door. Whitesprings is always nuked because it has a high amount of ghouls. When they are nuked they become glowing and are high level and some are legendary. It's the best place to farm for legendary weapons.
---
So are L50, others are L45 as max level. Same for certain types of armor. 
---
Hunting you can find 50, pump shotty 45, combat shotgun I think 50.
---
I personally use the reshade and haven't had any issues with being banned. It's entirely cosmetic and doesn't influence game-play so It should be fine. I personally wouldn't believe everything about bans I read on this sub, there were a lot of people banned for duping who wanted to either claim innocence or blame it on something else.  
---
As for Raw mouse input, I just use the default mouse settings, so I wouldn't be any help there. I don't even know off the top of my head what kind of Acceleration Fo76 Uses. In general, most things like that are generally carbon copies of fallout 4, so when in doubt let that be your guide. 
---
I agree. I‚Äôm all for a challenge and better gear providing better benefits, but I can only suspend disbelief so much. 
---
If I shoot someone in the face with a rifle from 10 feet away there‚Äôs no way it has an almost zero effect. 
---
Weapons max out at either lvl 45 or 50. The gear enemies drop is scaled to their level, not yours, so you gotta start killing lvl 50+ critters
---
Certain areas drop certain lvl weapons. Mire and Cranberry Bog drop up to
---
Lvl 50. Some weapons max lvl is 45, others are 50. 
---
Just an update that keypad is powered now as of patch 7 no idea how to get the code tho
---
I figured out what happend, somewhat - it changed the name of the card and the description.  But it's still Gunsmith level 5.
---
I dunno if it's because of mods?  But I deleted my custom.ini, so, I'm not sure if I'll try something else to fix it or not at this point.
---
Yeah, different spot.  Looked at the map and the spot I had was north west of Firebase Hancock and north east of Johnsons Acre. 
---
I think that whole area is full of hidden cliffs and secluded lakes. 
---
uh well I figured it was daily but acutally I just did the quest earlier today and out of curiosity, tried again a few hours later (now) and he just gave me another quest O\_O
---
Well, yea not the very first. But is the perk mysterious stranger one of the very originals who somehow survived the plague or is he someone else from vault 76 who also went through the quest?
---
Well it's a runescape joke. Sorry for insinuating anything nefarious, however, that was not my intent.
---
Read above. Def leave some foundations empty in your house and plant your crops inside. Look all doors and make sure you don‚Äôt use doors or windows that have broken glass or a work bench too close to either. That‚Äôs how people enter through locked doors. 
---
I'm in, what's your GT? 
---
Would love to get my mitts on one for my fallout memorabilia shelf 
---
The Cosmic Toe
---
I enjoy the game too, but you don't see me writing cringy delusional essays about the world not being ready for the game. It seems like you let people criticizing the game get to your head.
---
Party boy seems to only effect the stat increase, nothing else.
---
Thanks for the foundation tip! good to know about the area then because i got nuked while i arrived might steer clear until im a higher level and dont die to radiation instantly. 
---
Yea, go east. Most weapons max at 45 or 50.
---
 But keep in mind there are a few that max out at 40, like the ripper. 
---
or you could just make a spotify playlist yourself
---
Platform?
---
they have a Android app called falloutradio fyi
---
I can confirm the Beer-crit version is busted too. I drank a six pack and scored a dozen crits over the space of 30 minutes and the quest does not update beyond, 'score a critical'
---
Have radaways on favorite and spam a couple, run for the enclave or whitesprings, you'll make it. I've had it happen a few times on pc.
---
Was able to finish it by doing many crits in Morgantown 
---
 Somewhere in the end of all this hate  
---
There's a light ahead that shines into this grave  
---
That's in the end of all this pain
---
In the night ahead, there's a light upon this house on a hill  
---
Living, living still, their intention is to kill and they will, they will  
---
Somewhere in the end we're all insane  
---
To think that light ahead will save us from this grave  
---
Living, living still, their intention is to kill and they will, they will
---
Just getting back in same as you.
---
Used to be six workshops with crash‚Äôs the server. Glad to see we can get more now. Do you know how many the server can handle?
---
I had no idea about the windows thing could not figure out how people kept entering my shack, thanks :)
---
For me, sometimes it shows 2 of every part in my excavator armor but when you try and transfer them back to your inventory, they switch back to being only one of each. So I think it's just an error in how it shows the items but isn't actually 2 items.  
---
Thank you
---
Thanks for playing tonight

Absolutely. Funnily enough, The damage resistance system in Fallout 4 and 76 actually does a pretty decent job of realistic damage mitigation.
---
You can get Swarm of Suitors to work? Those damn mirelurks just refuse to spawn for me
---
4k 
---
How do you get the new BoS paints? I havent heard anything about them beyond the fact that they‚Äôre in the game
---
None auto pistols need a buff and I feel that a new perk that fans the remaining bullets into areas you target is a solid change offering burst and bullet/resource management.
---
Imagine slowly damaging a guy until they are roughly 50% health left, then fanning the remaining bullets 6 times to the enemies head costing 70 ap total in vats at a 50% chance rate with a executioner none auto pistol.
---
I‚Äôm not too familiar with full auto pistols, but im glad guerillas are doing good, kind of want my cowboy to be feared not questioned or felt as though he‚Äôs being carried. I wanna bring more to the group other then charisma perks and shared perks.
---
I don't know why but fast traveling breaks the event, I have to spawn at a nearby area and walk their for them to spawn properly
---
No worries m8, hope you enjoy West Virginia!
---
Why, both my 18" home defender and my 28" both take 5 in the tube.
---
That's what they said in the road map! 
---
I was amazed to see that even Firecracker Berries glow like they're powered by the sun itself.
---
What are you looking for?
---
If that is intended they should update the perk to say it triples the S.P.E.C.I.A.L buff of alcohol rather than the 'effect'
---
My motherboard is a H81M-E33 by Msi, my PSU is a Shocker 500W from pcyes!, and my game straight up freezes. Once, it froze my entire computer, and literally no programs were working anymore, so I had to restart it.
---
Sounds like you think anyone gives a shit about what you think while simultaneously telling someone else that no one gives a shit what they think :)
---
You only need a few common materials to repair it. No big deal. 
---
I think they should make them cooperative. If you join a defense event, then you get a share from the extractors and free (or cheaper) travel until the next event. The more dangerous workshops will be less popular, so you're less likely to be sharing at those and the rewards will be naturally higher. The only problematic part is build budget trolling.
---
An alternative would be to simply rebalance the cost/reward of different workshops to reduce contention. Currently you have places like Poseidon, Gorge Junkyard and Charleston Landfill that provide relatively valuable resources and are cheap to defend, while others are almost never taken.
---
No idea if it's intentional at all, just noticed that from my own testing. I'd be inclined to agree with you though.
---
Grab a gamma gun. They can either stand still and die to radiation damage or move and deactivate their armor.
---
Staggers also turn the effect off. All weapon types except pistols get stagger chance. You used to be able to full automatic critical hit through it, but they nerfed that in the most recent patch.
---
You're doing it wrong man
---
I can help if you still need. GT The Phanimal
---
Buddy, I'm trying to prevent all of us from getting griefed, here. Is your idea of fun having someone partially claiming your workshop and then hunting you across the entire map until your cap pool is completely empty?
---
This is what it sounds like when doves cry...
---
Understandable. Sad thing is. Most. People now don‚Äôt care to grind. Easiest way to achieve the next goal or something like that. 
---
Maybe just nerf some effects. Like does unyielding need +3 per piece?  Go to +1 and see the difference and adjust as needed. 
---
Boost anti armour. Add set bonuses. 
---
People are selling backpacks on the marketplace subreddit already. I wonder what‚Äôs going on.
---
Omg... that was only an issue IF your camp didn‚Äôt place and you took them out via your pip boy. Pretty sure that got fixed that the other day. But even if they didn‚Äôt you can still directly take them out of the fermenter. 
---
That totally makes sense, thanks for the advice! I'll definitely use that gamma gun suggestion to deal with it in the meantime. I still think it needs a change, since spamming rad away would be a really easy counter since it seems like there's so much of it everywhere once you hit endgame, a but happy to hear there is some recourse to it. 
---
It only spawned 1 for me
---
Awesome! But how do I know if you‚Äôre trustworthy?
---
I used to do something like this in fallout 3. Venture out to a predestined location with a rolling pin and a BB gun. Then go back. Gonna steal this idea,
---
Thanks!
---
What you describe is basically just a fully automatic pistol with the concentrated fire perk.
---
Non auto pistols might be better than full auto now that they nerfed critical hits. 
---
&gt; Maybe just nerf some effects. Like does unyielding need +3 per piece? Go to +1 and see the difference and adjust as needed. Boost anti armour. Add set bonuses. 
---
Agreed, there are a ton of small changes that could add up to a much more balanced meta. Bethesda seems like they're doing it slowly, but its also going to be much more important once Survival mode drops and there are leader-boards. 
---
lol, looks like I hit a sore spot.
---
Same boat.  Done 100s of BOS events and treasure maps, no luck.
---
https://imgur.com/wXBHiD9.jpg thanks for playing tonight
---
You've clearly never listened to the holotapes at WestTek or read the terminal entries there. 
---
It just worked for me, not sure how low my condition had gotten, but I had put off a good 50 shots. It activated, checked my condition and it was full. 
---
Just invited you, still available?
---
Don‚Äôt quit the game while in Whitesprings. 
---
Lol!!!
---
I've been trying to get the plans for the past half hour server hoping and every time I got it up, they're gone.  Wtf...
---
I mean I‚Äôve agreed with valid complaints here and posted angry threads during periods where the game was particularly buggy or stagnant and acknowledge all that. Not sure what gave you that impression. I‚Äôm just giving a devs feedback that they‚Äôre moving the right direction and being thankful and being positive. You should try it sometime.
---
Bloodied builds won't be spamming radaway or else their build breaks. Also, radaway lowers your thirst meter so they end up hurting themselves in an endurance fight. My advice would be to throw a barrage at them, switch to your damage gun, and watch for them to dodge. Shoot them as they dodge the gamma gun.
---
Then don‚Äôt read it...?
---
Thank you for the write up. You are absolutely right. You cannot achieve these god builds without making use of duped and exploited items. Even if a player didn't dupe, they are still buying duped items. These assassin's sentinel builds are absolutely insane. 
---
I really hope they fixed all duping, and more importantly I hope survival mode requires a new character. Then I would hop on survival gladly.
---
My Gt is SilentPandoYo you can add me if you want. I'll let you hold my AA Grognak axe while we do the transfer. And I don't require the caps I'm glad on just helping. I'm not sure when I'll be on tho.
---
Right now BGS is trying their best to not tick off more people. Take away all the ‚Äúhard‚Äù earned legendary items people. Or nerf their precious god slaying meta gear and there will be a riot. 
---
But yes percent and flat reductions are needed. 
---
Men have been killed for less.
---
Sure do appreciate it! I‚Äôll let you know if I still need help come an hour or so!
---
We have some delicious locally made beers in WV. Mothman is a good one. 
---
All very true! And I think Anthem will get there eventually too. As a matter of fact, 76 is not ‚Äúthere‚Äù yet, but this was certainly a step in the right direction.
---
This post is just pathetic
---
Life in WV is just basically Fallout IRL. Abandoned vintage trailers and all :P

---
First try walked up to an open door and they were laying right there for the taking.
---
That's great advice man, thanks! I'll definitely put it to good use! I've got a 3\* 50% limb damage, 30% super-mutant damage, 90% reduced weight gamma gun that sounds like it might finally have a use haha.
---
Yeah, it's meeting varying amounts of success. Heavy gun builds still fuck me up. I'm actually looking for a life saving sentinel right leg at the moment as my last piece of armor. Right now it's one auto-stim sentinel, one vangaurd sentinel, two assassin sentinel, and the right leg that needs to be replaced which is just vangaurds with agility and extra durability. I tried to get armor pieces that innately have rad resist too so I don't need to hit the panic button when someone whips out a gamma gun. Then a vampires shotgun to keep me topped off. 
---
All said it works pretty well? I mean I can hardly kill anything I took so many tanky perks but that's fine for PvP as most players are pretty squishy and if they have assassin's sentinel then like vic said up above you just have to stagger. Still trying to find the right balance between damage and survivability. 
---
Some people don't have mics, and I don't know if the Xbox or PS4 version have a proximity voice chat
---
If your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. You're a whinger
---
Honestly, I think there would be some upset people, but I doubt people would outright quit the game over it. The people who are stacking all these things together are a generally small portion of the player-base, so while they might get upset, I think its better for everyone if their crazy powerful build gets brought slightly more in line with everything else.
---
I do that to people all night long! üòÇ$$$
---
Welcome to PvP! 
---
Okay, how long should my essay be?
---
Works fine on mine... Ps4, applied it between the Feb patch and the most recent one
---
Treasure maps are fun or try pvp.
---
This just isn't a fun way to handle these things. No one would've known the dome was activated until it was datamined, because there's no hint. There's no light that goes on near the dome when it's able to be opened, no way to tell. Maybe it *should* be like that.
---
But on top of that, there's no hints. No rhyme or reason to the placement of everything. If there were clues hinting to each location it would be 1. more fun and intuitive, and 2. not necessary to dig into the game files for information about it.
---
I stumbled across a cliff edge with three of those traps with three skeletons on them. Each trap had it's own TNT push fuse attached to it. It was fun watching the traps launch the bodies into the air. They made it a good distance so I'm going assume this dude made it pretty far with his jet pack.
---
On another note, this would be an excellent way to get on top of things that Marsupial can't. That is if where you're jumping to allows you to setup camp close enough.
---
I've noticed stability but lagging. Probably just me.
---
I doubt every single player will remember this. Just a feeling.
---
I did it solo,  no glitch....
---
Is getting the daily  quest random? I went to talk to Biv and he didnt give me anything &gt;&lt;
---
:( I saw they nerfed the sell price of flux. Back to glowing meat, blood, and weapons, ig.
---
They are already balanced. If took same amount time looking it up as you did writing a post that makes you look silly, you would know that. There are SEVERAL ways to mitigate that armor.
---
What console?
---
They just have to change it so that additive stacking effects like Sentinel and Cavalier become multiplicative ones instead, Assassin could be nerfed too I guess but since it's a primary effect it should be stronger than tertiary ones. One of the reasons for the nerf to the explosive effect from legendary weapons was because it outclassed every other legendary effect for guns, even primary ones that are supposed(?) to be the strongest. 
---
I think that Bethesda is just waiting until they release Survival Mode and PvP becomes more popular(I hope) to add these kind of ''PvP balance'' additions. 
---
I started playing this game dead against PvP, I didn't touch it at all until I completed all the main and side quests.
---
Now I mainly PvP other players, as a rule only levels 80 or over. It really is fun and 90% of other players appreciate the action. 
---
After every PvP event I send a message and we swap tips and discuss our builds. 
---
The new daily and weekly quest tracking also adds a new dimension to the game.
---
Building a good PvP build is quite difficult and gives something to strive for ( I've never bought anything off other players ) and looking for plans/ farming for that perfect weapon /armour can flesh out your game time.
---
There's also the rare apperrel you can look for and hidden daily quests, such as the one for brotherhood where you have to take a sample of DNA from a scorchbeast for example, there's a few like that.
---
Have you got the Nuka cola and quantum paints/ collected every pa even LV 45 raider.
---
Or maybe try to get the plans for every piece of raider armour ( good luck with that, I don't think anyone has achieved this yet without buying them ).
---
There's plenty to do if you've got the patience.
---
Your tse is duped. Drop it in a swamp so no one can find the bag and leave it
---
It was cool üòé I was with you guys six queens it was fun 
---
Well if you read it, I described a new perk card idea providing none automatic pistols a quick burst, costing 70% of your ap, and giving them a deadly edge over enemies with low health. 
---
I personally think there are much better weapons then pistols and the main reason people use them now is as a lightweight secondary weapon to kill low level enemies.
---
like you said they nerfed crit which effected the full autos, but I‚Äôm not talking about full auto 10mms, im talking about .44 and western revolvers, giving them another use other then a side arm to save bullets when low level monsters spawn near you.
---
Honestly this could give none auto pistols a niche role with the burst. I mention later on in my post side notes about changes that I‚Äôd like to see but am not expecting, the main concept I‚Äôm hopeful Bethesda will read and possibly implement. 
---
I mean. I bought it off a level 2 mule, so you just might be onto something. Not tossing it though that man was charging ridiculous prices
---
Yeah. I tested it a few time I think it was about 5 times, but I logged off and relogged in a few times to repeat the message from appearing and to make it not appear a few times. I have my camp in same location as it was originally and haven't gotten the message again the only thing is C.A.M.P bench isn't in my building and is just randomly outside because I know it will most likely get the message if I bring it back inside. I haven't tested if they fixed the glitch since the hot patch on Friday, but I don't want risk it since I already spent so much time. 
---
Easy. Just move your camp to wherever you wake up. Instantly home! And. not against any of the rules... lol but it does sound like an interesting challenge.
---
Okay thank you
---
Have you gotten the invisible enemies yet?   No hitbox, no mesh, no noise, yet they still can attack you...
---
Rrrrright.... I will add to the rule. 
---
That‚Äôs an awesome explanation.  My first build is what I call a paladin, high defense heavy weapons build for steady mid level damage and stimpak group heals with rad sponge. I was leaning towards a rifle or auto rifle build but 1) can‚Äôt reduce their weight and 2) auto rifles for me burn ammo and I don‚Äôt like mindlessly farming for hours on end. I was at around 3 hours of farmed ammo gone in 30 mins. The ONLY reason I was thinking non-auto pistols is it frees up strength points for more weight reduction, lightweight themselves, and can reduce them even further. However, this game is agonizing when using weak weapons so I‚Äôll probably stay away from pistols since I was neither wanting a stealth nor a Crit build. Probably will do a non-auto rifle build with tons of weight reductions instead.
---
Ps4 ...the only console üëç my friend
---
For me they‚Äôve been very stable on PS4 since the last two major patches.  
---
Just happened to me.  Excellent team has the queen almost dead with 15 to spare.... Server collapses
---
Ah, sorry then. I got one of those 3* tse gauss. I‚Äôm moving away from the character so I was gonna give it to you. Best of luck finding one though.
---
I just got the Nuke Cola Quantum paint, but I‚Äôve never been interested in PvP as it gets pretty intense. And I‚Äôm more interested in exploring! I just feel like I‚Äôve run out of places to go. 
---
Pacing worked ok in BETA, but now that there's always a high level player at Whitesprings, that's a huge block to storyline progression.
---
Plenty of non-mission exploration to do though. Check out the parts of the Forest that you haven't visited first (the northeast is untouched by quests). Then poke around Toxic Valley and then the Ash Heap. 
---
If you're struggling solo against level-appropriate enemies, I'd strongly recommend abusing stealth. I'm not sure if stealth is intended as a solo balancing mechanism, but it certainly works.
---
Still seems like whitesprings is the best place to level.
---
Just follow other people there toss a grenade or use a tesla rifle.
---
Thanks bud. Appreciate the thought
---
I wonder if it has something to do with the amount of players in one area... there were 15 players all fighting the queen while I was doing the event.
---
Hey man, Pretty sure there are a couple people who have agreed with me, so I don't think my post makes me look silly.   
---
The ways to "Mitigate" the fact you can get over 75% damage reduction are no-where near enough. The point of my whole post is that these armors should be brought in line with the other legendary effects, to help the player base as a whole. Even with things like Staggering and radiation damage, its still way more powerful that any other legendary armor effect in terms of defense, and that seems imbalanced. 
---
Xbox
---
i‚Äôm guessing walk around and kill mobs? or is there some kind of spot to go to 
---
Upper left corner of the map, by the new vault, that whole hillside seems to be off limits now. My girlfriend had her camp there and it got removed but it let her put it back and then got removed again.
---
Haha nice. That new rule number seven.
---
There were seven of us... Even less than usual.  The servers are just abhorrent garbage.
---
This was my first online multiplayer game, I played it like any other Fallout without thinking about the multiplayer aspect. After trying several other MP games (Anthem, Final Fantasy Comrades, Apex, For Honor etc.) I began to truly appreciate the fact that I can play this like any other Fallout. No forced co-op, truly open world, no rubber banding. It‚Äôs truly a unique experience. 
---
Quick question, when running and switching to a gun etc it zooms in real far. How do you disable that?
---
If you say the earth us flat I am pretty sure you can find a few people who agree with you on that too.
---
Had a level 222 \*lure\* me and a friend into a deathclaw trap, which turned out to be hilarious. 
---
Ok thanks for trying all that out, I think I will lay down the basic build again tomorrow but leave the camp bench where i place it first.  
---
On Xbox there's a 50/50 chance of a nuke launch shutting down an entire server... And it's also common for them to collapse during scorched earth events.
---
Yes there is stagger and rads or you could just mitigate it 100% with crit.
---
the golf course clubhouse next to the tennis courts, not the main building.
---
When they spawn its pretty good. I forget what level i am i'm over 100, and i can still level there.
---
Besides that place, i'd try anywhere with a lot of super mutants, they seem to give a lot of exp imo.
---
Concentrated fire head shot crits melts sentinel builds.
---
Not so easy after latest patch but easy enough.
---
Also gamma gun with deep dish and automatic.
---
Stagger perks with shotgun or heavy weapons also works so I hear.
---
It's honestly the most annoying thing, worse than the teleporting ones. Luckily, the totally invisible ones are pretty rare for me.
---
Fair. 
---
I‚Äôd love to see a hard nerf and with that see more creative builds and play styles. And not the default cookie cutter ones. 
---
dude thanks.  imma try this tonight
---
I'll give it to ya
---
Correct.  As stated above, stagger, rads counter sentinels and cavaliers.   As do VATS criticals.  Those asking to ‚Äúnerf‚Äù due to perceived unfairness are just ignorant or lazy.  
---
With a hillbilly three dog as dj
---
i'll give you 700 for it
---
I do have an awful lot of treasure maps, I‚Äôll have to look into them again. I tried them before I knew the map and obviously they were way too hard, but I‚Äôm sure I can manage them now! Thanks for the tip!
---
I've listened from lvl 1 to 18. Never once heard country roads. I actually get the same songs over country roads
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a bug where the game thinks you‚Äôre cheating if too much damage is done at once I believe 
---
Oh boy ü§£ I‚Äôll have to try that one for sure! 
---
I just scrapped it. Probably shoulda kept it for when they inevitably fix the bug... Damn, I'm having regrets
---
Licensing fees would be pretty damn high.
---
Thx I guess
---
Ok
---
I had the same issue a couple of nights ago. It did eventually go away. 
---
I had to server jump 20 times before I gave up and slept in the bed that is bunker 7. Once I woke up, the plans were on the table..not sure if that helps or not, but it seemed to reset the spawn 
---
It looks like one of these PvP armor sets is gonna be required if you want to perform well in survival mode at all 
---
Stop asking for ‚Äúnerfs‚Äù to anything.    I am glad you raised the distinction between PVE and PVP.   Why impair my PVE build just because you want to PVP?   
---
Create alts that specializes a weapon type or two.  Ie sniper, melee, heavy weapons, automatic weapon toons.  You will do a lot of trading to properly equip all those toons.  I have 2 toons, working on my 3rd.  There doesn‚Äôt seem to have an advantage having very high levels anyway 
---
I've disconnected twice today in about 4 hours not had much of a problem normally but today is bad
---
Oh I got a prime blueprint from a scorch beast today as well forgot to look at it
---
Hasn't worked since the patch for me either. PC. 12 tokens away 
---
from the mask :(
---
It's my favorite questline,  early on I had my CAMP near the manor and would offer help to anyone attempting the quest.
---
Mostly so I could go through it again.
---
I drank one and then opened a weapons workbench. When I passed out I woke up in the same spot at my camp
---
Here's [one](https://open.spotify.com/album/0sPURcvc9VDouO1Q0mmVyc?si=agAIF3SVSPGikIwH3QUTcA) to add to that list
---
I am sorry for that, my XBox brethren.  
---
Here's my issue, the things you're talking about are generally specific counters. The other defense increasing effects like Vanguards or Bolstering don't require any special consideration other than higher defense always makes armor piercing better. It's a strange mini-meta that I just don't think is healthy. My entire point was to balance these items to bring them in line with other legendarys specifically to avoid things like "Use this specific gun or build". 
---
You're allowed to disagree, but the Ad hominem arguments aren't necessary, and generally if your argument contains a logical fallacy at its core it's not a very good one.
---
They need to add dual wield pistols.  Or at least two boxing gloves 
---
Well, the staircase is working and is even stackable. The problem is when we also want the other more normal stairs. I river i wanted my house to make a sort of bridge and at the same time having the staircase in the water. Another problem with them, trying to put walls around them.
---
To stack staircase. Build a fondation. Concrete or wood, both are good. In the stair category, the last object is a metal pole. Use this. It attach itself to the side of the fondation. Put another pole on top of it. Remove (store) the first pole. Now attach the staircase to the pole. Then put the stored pole on top of the other and store the bottom pole. Now you can attach a second set of stairs.
---
We can repeat this as long as we don't reach the limit of our building bubble. That was my other problem in the river. Where and how to deploy the camp decice so it allow me to build higher? In the end i settled for something i could build easier.
---
Hey thanks a lot!  So tired of the limited songs on the in-game radio, but I didn't know to start to find an "old-timey" selection of songs.  What would be REALLY cool is if we could drop songs into FO76 and make our own station/playlist, I would use this playlist in a second!  Awesome!
---
o/~ you got to aaaaacceeeentuate the positive...
---
o/~ eeeeliiiiminate the negative...
---
Damn it, who‚Äôs been cutting onions?!
---
You'll find another, I scrap one every 2 weeks or so. 
---
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks dude we just partied up
---
I woke up at the same cliff with the rope (I think it‚Äôs a slackline) too!
---
Hilarious.  That sure beats my idea of putting my stack into the Overseers Camp chest.  
---
I've been through the quest several times and through the ski lodge pretty thoroughly and never found Brodys corpse.
---
yup, coming to you
---
Wow, seriously? I tried to play it as a single player RPG and I did every quest in the game within two months. I mean, there are literally like 30 quests in the entire world including main, side and miscellaneous quests. It‚Äôs patchetic.
---
I'm not even saying I'm right, I just don't think its fair to rag on me for making a post to discuss balance changes.  If I said "People agree with me therefor I'm correct" sure, but I'm not, I'm just saying I don't think my post deserves an ad hominem fallacy directed at me right off the hop, especially when I'm not being inflammatory in the first place.
---
I wish you could wear your armor under the Garb of Mysteries.
---
That's really the only thing that made me store mine away,  as good as it is my full legendary armor set is better.
---
I know it kills me that's people would rather try to break some of the few things that are balanced ingame, rather than do a simple internet search. Yes the armor is so crazy OP that any crit mitigates it 100%. Or be wild and crazy and combine it with stagger and it might as well be wet tissue for protection.
---
This ain't it
---
If you know where to farm lots of rare junk, you should be good. I usually go to the whitesprings and kill ghouls - each one gives at least one piece of junk containing good components. Or the blackwater mine, which is right near the whitesprings - there's lots of different junk items there. When I loot everything and kill all the ghouls, I just do a server hop to make everything respawn again. 
---
Also, a good place to farm screws it the Top of the World, because there heaps of portable fuel tanks lying around the place at the camps (like south cutthroat camp)
---
You get them the same way you get the Initiate paint: turn in tons of Technical Data and pray you get lucky.
---
Olivia happened.  Go look at his lab and go through Olivias terminal.  THe lab is riddled with bullet holes and burns,  nasty smears of what could be dried blood.
---
Safe to assume Shannon laid his body to rest before she set out.
---
/r/market76 is pretty good.
---
Cargo hunting is extremely hard the first time but its really easy on the third
---
&gt; Stop asking for ‚Äúnerfs‚Äù to anything. 
---
I don't think I actually did, or at least didn't mean too. Nurfing usually implies making said thing like a Nurf toy, basically harmless and useless. I really just am trying to suggest ways to balance these specific items because of their implications in PvP. 
---
Super market sweep!
---
I was going with that. But didn‚Äôt want to feel old. 
---
IIRC the die off of Appalachian survivors occurred not long before Vault 76 opened,  that's why there are so many "fresh" corpses around.
---
Did you report it?
---
Here‚Äôs what I have set up since they fixed the keypad power switch:
---
Put one of those tall conduit pipes on outside wall. Connect the outside end to the keypad switch, then keypad switch to garage door.
---
On the inside, connect the conduit to the another switch, then switch to door. Main power should also connect to the inside conduit connector.
---
Now when you hit the keypad it‚Äôll open then automatically shut after a few seconds. Inside switch opens from inside, and you can close it either from outside keypad, or if you‚Äôre like me the switch is right inside the door and can be hit to close it.
---
Yea that's partially my point, I don't want to see there be one or two viable sets for Survival mode, It would be more fun if there is some variety to builds, and bringing these items in line with the other sets feels like that could help.
---
Huh I‚Äôll have to try this. I‚Äôm so tired of spawning at the bottom of the cliff and running around and up. Idk why it always puts me at the bottom it drives me nuts. 
---
That's dumb =[
---
The 6 flat damage at level one does not make up for mobs innate resistances to energy as well as energy weapons lack of penetrative attributes to work around resistances, nor does it address energy weapons lack of relevant legendary status. 
---
I agree, except with entering buildings. I‚Äôve had a few crashes since Thursday, and they‚Äôve only been from entering at the load in. 
---
What platform are you on?  If you're on PS4 I'll happily be your muscle for the whitesprings bit.
---
Before the fight I put on a full set of zealots, grab my endangerol syringer and fuck that bitch up. If the nukes dropped right and I can fight outside the blast zone then I'm gtg, if not I don't bother.
---
I've killed her with just 2 players in the past but I'm not sure if you still can, everybody has to pull their weight, if there's any free loaders it makes it very difficult.
---
That much I know but didnt the 2 women from the quest line kill each other a good couple years prior? Or is my timeline off 
---
Ok. I respect your opinion. 
---
i either have to delete the vod,  or play without the radio.  it sucks
---
Lag is too bad (at least for most people).  I've died twice today, and spamming radaway and stims doesn't prevent death.
---
Whatever weapon it is everyone is using it and taking all my workshops no problem. Pvp may he broken but its cutting into my pve experience when i can even have a workshop 
---
I'm gonna drop you plans at your camp, take what you don't have, leave the rest
---
That‚Äôs gonna be a yikes from me 
---
Yeah I sorted it but my new house is right below a bit flight path and my turrets nail them
---
Ah, not as rare as I thought then. Phew.
---
Still, once it's fixed, it should be a useful little weapon, eh?
---
Are you using strange in numbers?
---
I really love fallout but when some try hard cheaters are one shotting me and keeping me from just solo play fun this is a problem 
---
People want to explore West Virginia. Deal with it, troll. 
---
What is to fix?
---
Where do you find the hazmat suit?
---
Only 600 levels away from their true nature.   
---
No
---
I gave you a hard time for asking nerfs for game mechanics you have not even attempted to understand. If you had made a post asking for help or wanted to understand why you can't beat a player in that armor I would have been happy to help you. That's not the route you took, instead you made an elaborate post about why the game needs to be changed because you could not one shot a player. That's why I said you look silly.
---
really ? people actually need to buy ammo?  I'm constantly dropping the stuff
---
If you complete the miner miracles quest with a suit of excavator pa that you didn't craft, and didn't get the plans from the terminal, you cannot get the plans after the quest
---
Yep 5.56 and .45 often sell for .5 caps each. Shot gun instantly sells for .5 each and more often .75 caps.
---
I turn off the in-game radio and just stream A-bomb Radio on tune.in on my PC or use the apllp on my phone. Tons more music, so no more boredom. It would be nice yo add stations...  I did that in FO4. Maybe someday. 
---
Tha is again!
---
I've done 4 or 5 SQ on Xbox since the last patch and havent had any issues. In fact I think I only had to wait once to actually collect items because of the skinnies. Could be you had a super on that was begging the server down. Hope it gets better for ya.
---
That's because he gets stuck in the wall now! (At least on Pc) I do a lot of business with just his arm....
---
Vanguards or bolstering add other buffs to builds that can't be countered. Sentinel/cav have a stronger situational defense but can be countered. That's how balance works.....
---
It‚Äôs the domes at the black ordnance works - west of vault 76. There are hidden quests to get the nuka cola T51 paint and the X01 quantum paints.
---
You got upvoted but I got downvoted what the hell lol
---
there is a report feature built into the game now.  report it.  no need to make a post about this kind of thing.
---
I don't know, but I do know that  
---
  
---
#THE WORLD WON'T BE READY FOR IT
---
Has to be at least 20 hours from the last Daily you completed from him.
---
You also sometimes need to keep talking to him to get him to give it to you. Just keep mashing your use button.
---
I server hopped three times to get the key. Got to TNT 7 and it was already open with the plans just sitting there.
---
I‚Äôm interested
---
I use the Garrahan mining building as it‚Äôs pretty fun to clear and it get a lot of variety in enemies (mutants scorched liberators etc...) so it doesn‚Äôt get too boring as well as there‚Äôs a good chance for a legendary drop from the leader downstairs and I‚Äôve been using it for a while and gotten a few good legendaries (I‚Äôm level 164)
---
Ah see I can‚Äôt really do that playing online w friends on console without making a huge inconvenience. It blows tbh 
---
Still the best build with unyielding/sentinel and crit/bloodied build. (using heavy weapons)
---
Strange in numbers is confirmed broken, no idea what you have going on.
---
what? doesn't deserve to be nerfed. remember, running around with 20% health is a big downside of such a build and there are like so many ways to counter bloodied. people just need to step their game up. srsly.
---
Its not fun. Pvp doesnt exist in a traditional sense. anyone willing to fight has that same one shot kill gun and they abuse the power it gives them and fuck my pve gameplay by murdering me 
---
Well, the doors that can‚Äôt be opened say [restricted] or [inaccessible], something of the sort. The ones that can be opened say something like [Requires TNT Dome Key 7]. Other than that though, you‚Äôve got a very valid point and I definitely don‚Äôt expect someone to go check every TNTD with every update we receive. I love unmarked quests, solving riddles, and finding locations without map markers, but there definitely are no other indications to follow here.
---
For some reasons, the game still turned me off everytime I play it, keep experiencing bad de-sync on my end only if I join my friends' or brother's game session. Been trying to fix it for a few months...
---
AA is too powerful? what are you talking about mate? It's actually only really op combined with a crit build otherwise it is just...good. 
---
Improving accuracy works, anti armor not.
---
They are now lol 
---
Did they nerf bloodied weapons without telling us?
---
you forgot "I didn't know the gun was loaded, and I'm so sorry my friend"
---
I still believe some idiot at Bethesda either moved the release up to catch Christmas '18 sales, or ignored internal feedback that FO76 needed a bit more work before release.  But the uselessly short BETA points to the former.
---
This shit would have been GOTY 2019 if they had delayed a bit, and become known as a new refreshing take on the genre.  Now it's legacy is failure to launch, no matter how good it gets.
---
Again with the direct attacks man. You're putting words in my mouth as well. I made a post saying my opinion that these items should be re-balanced. I'm not infallible, neither are you. My problem however, lies in the fact you keep just attacking me for no reason other than I've made you upset by having a different opinion.   
---
Your generally hostile, and angry for no good reason. I made a post talking about what my thoughts where and that I feel these things should be re-balanced. No, I didn't mention the "counters" to these items, but I didn't outright know, and I still don't see it as relevant. Even with these specific counters, I still feel its not balanced, and generally not a great mechanic.   
---
I'm entitled to my opinion, you're entitled to yours. You saying my opinion being opposed to yours somehow warrants you being a dick is beyond me.  Even if I made a post that made claims I couldn't back up, personal attacks over a video game just makes you look petty IMO.
---
Is this Morgantown High? There is a scorched in the cafeteria that does that pretty regularly when I go through on plastic runs.
---
PC or Console? 
---
How did you get the ultracite gatlin plan?
---
I found this post and am on xbox, you seem like a lifeline. I'll buy modded guns from you if available at this time or anytime soon
---
Never said it was too powerful I dont think. Just that ballistic weapons outshine everything else by a mile because of this.
---
There's a spot in Harper's Ferry. The huge cliff above it used to be able to be camped at, but now you get the update message.

I'll bid 701 Bob.

---
Top ten most tragic and depressing tales of Waste Virginia, at least.  Maybe top 5.
---
Honestly I think I speak for most PvP players, but I might not, when I say it‚Äôs annoying to hear you call for nerfs when you didn‚Äôt even bother to research counters to this armor set. Stagger and radiation damage( if you spam radaway in a fight that‚Äôs seconds of damage that will make you lose every time). 
---
You gotta have some strategy when it comes to PvP and it seems like yours is empty the clip and hope for the best. Consider throwing cryo nades  to drain AP and negate perks like dodgy. Use power attacks to stagger the player, have a crit banked up so you can literally ignore 100% of the armor.  
---
I‚Äôd be happy to walk you through how to defeat a full Ass/Sent build if you play on XB1. 
---
Worked for me multiple times today on Xbox.  I was low health on my combat  rifle and it bumped it up nicely 
---
You asked for feed back. Sorry it was not what you wanted to hear.
---
You can find more copies of the dress on bodies in the world. Not sure if you can build the outfit again using them. 
---
You don‚Äôt understand and agree with how the order was supposed to work, that‚Äôs why you cheered for the raiders.
---
The order was clandestine, strictly cloak and dagger. They were never designed to be public, like the responders or BoS.  They were supposed to work in the shadows only, using the blades, the gas, the mask the voice.  They were so good at being quiet they mowed down the raiders. It wasn‚Äôt till Olivia turned that they all started dying off.
---
Your anger at Shannon is why you‚Äôre siding with Olivia.
---
You and a hundred others are. So its purely luck based and you know people arent stopping at one set of plans. 
---
I can't make it on top of things I could before, so maybe.. it could also be that my speed demon is slower, and my momentum isn't all there anymore
---
Just started my second character and I believe I will now wait until level 50 to complete missions I know that give a decent item reward.. like the mayor of Watoga mission
---
Cool I just equipped it and I'll finally get some use out of it.
---
Seems like it.  Kinda ruins it for others
---
Have you tried a vats sneak attack?
---
The doomed Responder cadets descending into essentially Hell was pretty good too.
---
You must not be on Xbox because it has been horrible since the patch and hot fix. It‚Äôs almost back to post launch crap. 
---
Yeah, the Garb should have an outfit version. 
---
&gt; Vanguards or bolstering add other buffs to builds that can't be countered. 
---
Armor piercing counters it pretty well, and because of how damage resist works you're never going to hit anywhere near sentinel levels of damage reduction with just plain resistance rather than mitigation, meaning that even without armor piercing weapons will do a reasonable percentage of their damage. The whole point is while they don't especially have *specific* counters, doesn't mean they can't be countered by high dps, headshots, or vats crits, all things every build is capable of doing.  
---
&gt; the funny part is all these posts target assassins sent/cav. If you looked around there are more people looking for unyielding for a reason combined with bloody it's a huge dmg increase plus combine it with dodgy and no one can land a hit on you. 
---
Just because I made a post about this doesn't mean those builds don't also need tweaking. In a multiplayer pvp environment, its not healthy to have one or two builds be predominant. Look at any other RPG with PvP. Whenever a specific class or build gets too meta or powerful, the devs bring it in line because its not healthy or fun to have everyone either get fucked or do the exact same thing as everyone else. Its a tough thing to balance, but Its always more beneficial to a multiplayer game to have a variety of viable end game strategies. 
---
I would love for them to fix the camp system. I have no idea why they made it even more limiting than FO4s. 
---
The only issue I see with Dogmeat, is you're going to end up with 348908345908345098345903485 dogs that are identical. 
---
Giv screen shots
---
I dont want to pvp because all they use is that one shot kill gun. But even with pacifist mode i still have no choice, people murder me anyways. And the bounty they have doesnt mean anything because they one shot kill anyone they want 
---
As someone from outside the sub looking in, what exactly is there in this game for single player rpg or even multiplayer looter shooter fans that aren't done better in other games? 
---
TLDR: red pill me on this game
---
Not as elegant as on in game, obviously. But better than nothing. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hgL2TUetOLtVIpsEH8HSKXbZtavKZqs-xgWBXQLLdg4/edit#gid=1058317721](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hgL2TUetOLtVIpsEH8HSKXbZtavKZqs-xgWBXQLLdg4/edit#gid=1058317721)

Apparently you've never lost a carwash (the de-rad arch)
---
Feedback as in constructive criticism, not "I'm going to call you silly and Ignorant because you don't agree with me". 
---
Try using party boy perk card also to increase the effects of alcohol. Also try concentrated fire perk as well. Or maybe you need the sneak perk card
---
True.
---
The daughter dealt a death blow, but her mother was still bleeding out. Boyfriend shot the daughter in the head. Mom cradled her daughter‚Äôs body as she finally died. 
---
PS4, meant to put that in the title. Sorry about that one.
---
yup
---
Got a camper to punch me triggering the combat mode and then blasting him with a shotgun
---
The problem is they are using these builds to kill pve players who never wanted to fight others in the first place (like me) im minding my own business but will still get murdered 
---
Energy Damage is still way too low i guess. Well hopefully they fix it, idc actually i don't like to play them anyway, but would be great for you
---
Mod my 3 star Gauss?
---
Ah dang, just saw Ps4
---
I reckon renaming guns would be very helpful as well..... Although there is the problem of trading/dropping the items after they have been renamed....
---
Are you killing hem in 1 hit?
---
What I don't get is why would people pay for that plan it's easily obtained unlike other plans
---
Woohoo Michigan
---
I was asking myself the same question as I walked around Whitespring killing non legendary ghouls. Also, I can 100 percent state that the legendary dropping legendary fix didn‚Äôt work. Also, a drill is NOT a legendary item. It‚Äôs ridiculous that they somehow think reducing legendary drops helps the game. 
---
It‚Äôs not like you can steal people‚Äôs atoms. What would be a good way to punish death in this game besides caps? Dropping aid items? Those are so plentiful it wouldn‚Äôt matter. Maybe dropping your gun or armor, but people worked just as hard for those as their caps. 
---
So please inform me on how you would‚Äôve designed this game minus the conspiracy theories.
---
I'm ok with that many digital dogs as long as I don't have to get an actual one.  
---
There's barely enough space for the 3 (and incoming) of us.
---
So I'll be happy with 348908345908345098345903485 identical Dogmeats, yeah.
---
What are you talking about? Duping was most prevalent when everyone was farming whitesprings. You could come up with like 50 legendaries an hour but that didn't stop people from duping
---
Yea I'm getting bored of just using lever actions and handmade. Would love to be able to buff up my 2 shot ultracite to be usable end game but the lack of penetration kinda cucks it
---
Yeah, and I sometimes do listen to my own music while I play, but there's something about 100% diegetic sound that's nice and immersive... It's a bit silly, though, you're right.
---
Chems don‚Äôt stack 
---
Let's all do this!
---
i have, ill try punching 
---
Wait so they lowered the rate legendary enemies spawn in whitesprings?
---
Just showing its stats would be enough for most purposes. I know my Excavator is \~450 def. i know my ultracite is aroound 600. Thats literally all it would take.  
---
I dont even use PA, except excavator for ores, and its a pain in my ass. I can only imagine what its like for people that actually use them.
---
Honestly, if I'm in the mood to level, I spam events. Sell/gift what I don't want, and fast travel to the next event. Event without Travel Agent, you'll almost always be making more than you're spending in travel. There's usually some event going on, and if there isn't, world hop, rinse, and repeat.
---
Might not be the most efficient method, but it sure is a nice change of pace from the constant grind at the golf course.
---
Happy hunting!
---
He just wants to be a hand model 
---
In my opinion when a musician or all the musicians that wrote the song perish their music shouldn't cost any copyright money 
---
I bet my balls it takes only one crit from me to take you down too lel
---
I have speed demon too so you may be right about the correlation between the two
---
Yeah I forgot you can preview things in the build menu my bad, still sometimes it‚Äôs nice to see multiple foundations worth. I‚Äôd be willing to throw in 100 caps for the tour and I won‚Äôt even kite a ScorchBeast I promise üòè
---
He's a legendary within his community by default now I guess.
---
That where the weird clicking noise coming from? Thought my game was glitching 
---
It was prevalent then because the game was a glitch filled mess.
---
Forgot to mention that it takes me 24 hours from the last time I did the last daily. Same time I can do the Biv daily‚Äôs for me.
---
Thaaat's pretty much it
---
I know this might mess with you a bit but try to remove all perk cards maybe it has to do with a perk card because when I did this one I used a lvl 5 character with only action girl and the 2 plant perk card on
---
I've honestly never run into another person in the game. I tend to wander far from anyone else, not on purpose, I just do
---
West Tek Research Center and the Uranium Fever event are my top 2. Expect to server hop though.
---
In doing that though, when text comes up in game as voice and I can't hear it because I have Danny Worsnop screaming out my speakers
---
Some people like West Tek. There are still legendary ghouls at whitesprings when it's not nuked. Otherwise seems like you are forced to do events now.
---
if you want some salty pvp add xXDemolisher, be careful of a full bloodied/crit/heavy build 
---
Wagons robots after you get the quest done that makes them not attack you would be the easiest.
---
you  hurt my head kid
---
You can look in the bag without taking anything. If you see  paper bag out in the wild have a look and if there is *anything* in there besides junk items, then someone intentionally dropped them. Ammo, food, chems, weapons, armour, ores, bobby pins; see any of those and the bag was dropped intentionally. 
---
Just changed to bloodied/heavy/crit build i guess the best you can have. i one shot everyperson with a crit to the head from my gatling lol. give it a try
---
I love this and I‚Äôm trying it first thing tomorrow
---
West etc. Watoga. Are current places for me. 
---
Yes. And we can conclude fixing glitches will help reduce duping rather than having legendaries drop better
---
Based on non scientific anecdotal observation, yes. Much fewer legendary ghouls. 
---
I've got a rifleman full specced out for crit and any rifle and I'd live to throw a laser in eventually. Just started my heavy character because the bugs they got are actually solid.
---
You can‚Äôt worry about every downvote man it‚Äôs the internet, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions but if people feel like it‚Äôs easy to find then you might get downvotes. It‚Äôs happened to me plenty of times and made me more prone to research before I post.  Hope you have a good day tho!
---
Sorry it happened. Next time just do the Server Hop and Block. 
---
As i understand it, Theyve fixed the radworm bug that was boosting mutation effects. I pretty much always have rad worms, so id gotten used to how high/far i could jump during the bug.
---
I mean that is nearly true, but I think the timeframe is something like 50 years payment to whatever entity owns the rights and then it goes to the public. (Prevents murdering artists for profit ;)
---
&gt;  it costs 25k for a decent piece of Assassin Sentinel
---
You mis-spelled "trade for similar item only".
---
Except that's not the reason I said that. If you read it in the context it was wrote that's pretty clear. Best of luck with your rebalance ideas. I am sure the developers will find it really insightful. 
---
Think it's more of a server issue
---
Haha, true enough. I'm actually totally ok with a zillion puppers running around in game, it just might look funny. 
---
And then it didnt even drop us in the same game when it reconnected. Our internet is not the problem. This is the kind of thing that makes hundreds of hour players leave. 
---
Duping won‚Äôt go away. They will just fine a new method. I give them a week. This is three patches that have tried, but it continues.  The point he is making is that casual players aren‚Äôt going to grind a game for a stalker tire iron. Dupers filled that gap. 
---
Thanks mate

"This time one time, Smarty says: "You are only as well as you feel." Only, I feel with my hands. And my hands only feel with my fingers. Or maybe my face? I feel legs. Legs well. Arms well. Head well. all parts feel well with hands. Only inside... Inside where can't feel, insides... empty like... like well in ground... Only can't be well if well is not touched? Empty well of touching feel... Lonely...."
---
dunno
---
Which watoga quest does that
---
Sheepaquatch is a new cryptid coming to Appalachia soon.
---
They must of already added in the horde event as a nameplate already
---
Thanks for the reply I‚Äôll check it out
---
I didn't notice a sound, but there might be one. 
---
I been server hopping for uranium it‚Äôs decent
---
Wait, the clicking? Isn't that the card things on the wall changing?
---
I met a really nice player who lured me into his camp, trapped me in a locked room, and murdered me with flamers, Tesla arcs and rad emitters. FML
---
Oof I‚Äôll look around x)
---
I tried that too. Didn't work either. 
---
Both are respectively good in their own rights with correct perks.
---
But I'd say furious handmade and if you run stealth with suppressor ohhhh not is it good üòä
---
Yes. Above the stash in the train station is one of those signs with the cards flipping.
---
It may not go away but it was reduced significantly after patches. Fixing glitches work. Banning dupers work too. Increasing legendary drops is rather a questionable approach
---
#WHAT
---
What system?  Xbox has been awful since the patch. 
---
Ps4
---
I've had defend against sheepsquatch at a workshop to show up to mole rats.  Soon though.
---
Ok. Thank you. Speaking of armor, is marine armor the best non power armor?
---
One moment 
---
It think they stealth nerfed adrenal reaction personally. 
---
Alrighty, do you happen to know the auto laser rifle or super sledge?
---
The mayor's quest.
---
I‚Äôve always felt like I jump higher when at lower weights vs capacity but I‚Äôve never actually tested it. Too many variables. 
---
DarnüòÇ. Ok, thanks
---
I see people owning 3-4+ workshops all the time
---
Where is the cabin...
---
Yeah but I haven't been able to get the daily since the patch though.
---
Not that I know of.. I usually claim sunshine meadows and munitions with no issues
---
I don't disagree with any particular point, but your vitriol is off-putting.
---
Ugh an edgy 12 yo
---
"Is that you, Billy?" 
---
Interesting. Just completed mine just now.
---
I would have said the same thing an hour ago, then while finally launching our first nuke, the server crashed right as the nuke left the tube, now we are on a new server. After all that work, but now with broken power armor and weapons, nearly no ammo or meds. 
---
Sure, that'd be great
---
That does sound pretty fun! I wonder if the mods would allow that here or if they'd want to create another subreddit for that?
---
I always thought that it would be cool to make your own station at your camp then you can find songs in appalachia to play. 
---
Are you still doing sbq
---
What works?  Throttled legendary drops aren‚Äôt going to inspire people to keep playing. No reward for a grind, in my opinion, will not entice people to either start playing or keep playing. 
---
Read my shit you dumb asses who own r/fo76. I did put a damned title and I am not clickbaiting stupid idiots
---
TITLE:  **Why do we even leave our PA when we die...** 
---
My GF said, since "someone" said "it just works", and it really doesnt....somebodynowes her a puppy... cause this is that bs
---
You‚Äôll be surprised at how many things you haven‚Äôt seen. After I got to the point you‚Äôre at I just turned on my area chat, went up to other players and offered to tag along on whatever quests they were doing. A lot of people don‚Äôt talk, which can be frustrating, but plenty of others do and they usually appreciate the offer. 
---
It‚Äôs fun to go back through the low level places with a purpose like that. You loot tons of junk, find secrets you missed and stumble on locations you didn‚Äôt see all the time. I‚Äôm level 119 with over 350 hours played and just tonight I found a new location I hadn‚Äôt seen before. 
---
Whoa
---
I just tried out a tinker bench on whitesprings resort and it seems they added new sound effects as well!
---
Failed 5 min ago :(
---
Well, that's the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen!
---
Found one in cran bog very bottom of map
---
The Ash Heap, far south. There is some near Hornwright Site 3.
---
Not enough bloodied melee characters :(.
---
Are you doing anymore?
---
i'm assuming they mean the train car east of the watoga train station, it has a destroyed mr handy in front of it.  
---
has an armor spawn typically marine armor parts or BOS knight / soldier underarmor.   
---
then if you keep going east to NAR repair, there is an armor spawn in the room with the workbench
---
I think these are "Armor" spawns and not "armor mod" spawns, but maybe it could/did spawn there, I only ever see armor.
---
Around Welch. Specifically, just north of the rail station
---
It wouldn't be the most unrealistic thing in the game, not a lot of creatures can take multiple shotgun blasts to the face either.
---
Sorry mate i need to restock, out of ammo. I'll most likely do one tomorrow.
---
My experience (pre-patch) is time of day doesn't matter, they're just easier to see at night.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to tag along with lower level people and ask if they want some help, but haven‚Äôt gotten many positive responses. I think unfortunately I just miss playing with my friends and they‚Äôre all dead set against playing anymore. Maybe I‚Äôll just start re-exploring now that I know I could‚Äôve missed some stuff! 
---
https://youtu.be/nlaoR5m4L80
---
This is a must. 
---
And fifth and sixth and seventh and eighth, etc. Portable Power is now mandatory for me.
---
Where is welch
---
Wouldn't it me nice... though :P
---
Add me ign promitheusaudio. Bloodied melee. And newbie be heavy
---
Lower middle of the ash heap.
---
"Coward" is rhe first word that comes to mind, also some stupid ass recently said "good luck getting people to pvp if this is how you treat them"... hippocrite. 
---
That's a version with a skin on them. They're a couple different stair types coming out eventually.
---
Doing Blackwater  brew questline? Welch in ash heap is where to go
---
Ah. So most of the time the game freezes outright? But the computer does not automatically restart? Crashing in general can be a result of a multitude of things, I like to pinpoint the exact source of the problem instead of going as far as reinstalling windows. 
---
Seeing your motherboard is very entry level, it should not dance around with any settings that may result in system instability. In most cases, if there is any thermal throttling of lets say, the CPU, GPU, VRM and MOSFET systems, you should see a noticeable drop in framerates due to throttling, or outright sudden system shutdowns. The game usually won't freeze or crash. 
---
The recent Windows update did cause issues in gaming, but microsoft already released a patch to fix this couple days ago. Now, if you have not done a reinstall of your GPU drivers already, i'd suggest you use DDU and try a driver reinstall. Sometimes something as simple as this can fix issues. Furthermore, are you experiencing similar crashes in other intensive games / programs? If you do, we can rule out the game itself and a bit of possible software incompatibilities. I'd suggest running Heaven Benchmark, Firestrike, or FurMark to see if any crashes occur. Afterwards, you may be able to open up Event Viewer and check for any application errors that would help you determine the reason behind crashing.
---
I highly doubt your CPU could be the culprit, and 8Gb of RAM is enough for this game, coming from experience, but I'd suggest you use Passmark's MemTest86 to check for any faulty RAM. You can also search up and use Intel's Processor Diagnostic Tool to see if your CPU has any problems.
---
How do you fast travel there? I can‚Äôt get the welcome mats to actually work.
---
Yeah, nothing they've done has fixed legendary drops in any way. Unless "fix" means "fewer, and shittier". 
---
That's nice. Being irritated at shitty practices that make the game worse is unpopular, I know, but so what. 
---
Since you mention drinking loads of booze, is there a perk card that makes you immune to alcohol addiction?
---
How do you know if that's gonna work? Some people just quit when they feel they beat the game. How you gonna address that?
---
Meh. 
---
People were duping because people would buy duped shit because even then, actual good drops were  fucking rare as hell. 
---
If you don't spawn in your camp you have to jump up there. The mats aren't fast travel points. Depending on where you put your CAMP machine you'll end up somewhere near that. Normally. Sometimes. If you're lucky. :p
---
I have shadowed leather leg plans if you still need
---
I agree but licensing the music would be really expensive, so I'd say it would be pretty unlikely for this to happen unfortunately.
---
I've seen pictures around of one wearing a shopping cart, too. Pretty funny.
---
Virgin XO1 versus Chad Excavator
---
I don't see drops getting any better it's only getting worse. Yet I see significant decrease in duping. Why is this happening?
---
also worth noting that mule spawning tech no longer seems to work. (EG logging on from a second account/relogging to a friends server) 
---
As far as I can tell, each spawn area has a timer (still working out how long they are. still in my work week, so my time to play is limited. Will be capturing more data when im off for the week)  
---
Wouldn't really care if they gave us the Raid Vaults first. But I'm getting bored in a hurry without being able to farm properly. This whole spending hundreds of caps / using my mule camps to FT is getting old in a hurry.   
---
Used to be able to farm a legendary every 34 seconds. Which seems fast until you consider there more than 346,000 possible legendary drops. and prob 75% of those are wood, leather, exterminators, scorched, berserker, Et all essentially useless effects. 
---
So for 8h invested in farming (not to mention the \~4300 shotgun shells used. \~160 crafts on shotgun shells dont come cheap) , ive got about a 0.25% chance to to find the 1 legendary item im looking for. (on \~850 drops) And some people wonder why someone will pay $ for items on ebay.   
---
If they keep nerfing drops/spawns, we wont have much choice but to buy from dupers for $.  
---
Im just waiting for the "use atoms to reset this spawn cooldown" 'feature' to drop at this point.
---
I tried this and ended up right next to my camp.... apparently an abandoned camp near my home is one of the points.... 
---
Sorry I‚Äôm confused is this a yes? 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôll do it. Flip them off and test again
---
I will swop you i have a shock
---
It's people that are either stupid, or selfish, or both.
---
They're "min/maxers" that have found out how to exploit the games flaws and become insanely OP with Melee weapons, and they want to stay that way.
---
I'm with you - and I'd give you gold if I had some.
---
To make rifles feel even reasonablely powerful I've had to max out a half dozen different perks and spend so many hours to finally get Legendary Two Shot Explosive (and most recently a Furious Explosive) rifles.
---
Plus, I have to use them from Stealth.
---
They're putting a lot of effort into removing the mechanisms to dupe items. 
---
My point is that removing the temptation to BUY duped fucking items would make risking the ban for duping items much less rewarding. 
---
I'm in ign name VegeraX
---
Block, block, server hop.
---
i once saw someone on ps4 named "JimCrowLaw", so it seems like their inappropriate name filters are a bit lacking when it comes to less obviously-horrible gamertags like these. best bet is to just report and hope theyre taken care of quickly :(
---
I played a second character with melee after coming to the conclusion guns arent worth the effort. My friend started one too using of course, guns. Needless to say, he had so much trouble compared to me it was almost like a completely different game.
---
I just got mine like half hour ago. I'm so happy. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/THX1aQT.png](https://i.imgur.com/THX1aQT.png)
---
If only they had a juggling emote, maybe with grenades 
---
Yes. Sorry was fighting for life. 
---
No no, you misunderstand. Stims and shit are just so heavy. It's an excuse to dump them instead of literally dropping them.
---
But for real, the 76 community is pretty friendly in general.
---
Why bother with that when getting rid of duping mechanism is working wonders atm? Isn't it more efficient to just do something about the game mechanism than to tinker with player behaviors? 
---
This isn't a MMO though
---
Yes
---
Always thought it was the game saving your progress in case your game crashes or lost connection
---
I find that occasionally, GeForce experience will pick up and "Optimize" FO76. This seems to turn on DSR, the game will crash frequently for me if DSR is on. 
---
100% Agree. To the person who I picked the lock on your workshop space while being dumb and not realizing it was yours, sorry. To the guy I accidentally blew up some cars on your workshop space and destroyed you/your turrets - again sorry. Seriously it‚Äôs just stupid crap that happens, esp when you are first figuring out how everything works. 
---
Settle down and retire. Your mission is over vault dweller.
---
Agreed. 
---
I found three legendary robots during my Watoga sales run last night. The instant death explosions in this patch are a pain because they apparently one-shot me through padded armor. Also makes it tough to find the carcass afterwards.
---
Same. 
---
God speed you magnificent bastard.
---
You know what does not care about damage reduction? The Gamma Gun.
---
I have the daily, drink wine, test my luck. Which turns into a crit vat.
---
I have gone through 3 bottles of wine with multiple crit vat kills and it always reverts back to drink fresh wine. 
---
Definitely a bug.
---
You do get that this is actually "Why do the devs keep destroying everything about the game that makes it worth returning to" post, not actual advice on how to reduce griefing post, right?
---
I'm frustrated that since launch, they've, step by step, made loot, and grinding for loot in this game, less and less rewarding. 
---
I just did a round of uranium fever and I got mad again, because I know I'll never get an item there worth collecting...and yet at this point it's the _only_ reliable way to get legendary items in the fucking game. 
---
rebuild your camp for caps (instead of resources) by moving it a foot or two and rebuilding from stored.
---
That's fascinating. I've spent more than an hour in watoga in the last two days with zero. Any point in the past, I would have gotten 10+ in that time. 
---
Probably adding a skin you can buy for CAPS, like with sledge hammers. 
---
Awesome much appreciated! Joining now. U fighting griefers or monsters? I can assist with both 
---
Team rocket? Is that you?
---
It took me quite a while, but I finally got it. I'm so happy with it. I've not been happy with the stock color, or plain steel,  so it's rad to have a paint scheme I really like. 
---
punching does  not work
---
To be direct I would say that it‚Äôs more open-ended than most games that offer similar mechanics and progression but steer you into a certain play style or cycle of activities to farm efficiently plus a lot of variety in item drops that created a healthy reddit trading market once Bethesda removed the exploiters/exploited items
---
Yeah we got on top of the AMS building. Haven't been able to that since they fixed the birdbones strange in numbers skywalking. 
---
This must be a PS4 problem because it worked perfect for me earlier
---
Why would devs want to make grinding easier when there's like 7 billion duped items already floating around the market?
---
That's a big negative ghost rider. I gotta think on this. But if Bethesda released a T.E.N.T system then I could use that instead.
---
grab hemlock holes for acid. Lucky hole mine in Excavator for lead. Hornwright test site #3 for steel (iron ore)  
---
I only have to hit them about 1x per week or so. Acid is the lynchpin.   
---
Turns farming ammo into a few minutes of work. (takes me like 15 min to run LH and HTS2. then just hop back to HH every 20 min or so for acid pickups. doesnt really interfere with the rest of what im doing)
---
It's possible that they cut down on the legendary respawns, so to get legendaries spawning for you, you need to keep moving. I never spend long in one place personally, so that wouldn't affect me.
---
Ok where do you find that???
---
I had something like this happen like a week or two ago. It was at nuked white springs. There was a dead BGO in the parking lot, doing that idle jitter ghouls do while standing up. I could walk up and loot it and everything.
---
Letting players name items means they have to store a lot of custom data. It‚Äôs a small feature that takes a lot of backend work. They know it‚Äôs highly requested, and they‚Äôve already confirmed that it‚Äôs coming, but it is a lot harder to implement than one would initially think.
---
Cranberry and snaptails especially
---
No on the way to you, look through my plans if there is anything you want
---
Got back to the paladins office and read about the ultracite armor. Plans will be uploaded to your pipboy to make yourself
---
Prettyyyy,  prettyy, pretty good.
---
Plenty of times
---
X01 has the same +100 carrying capacity of (base) Excavator armor if you install Calibrated Shocks mod on both legs.
---
Its under Endurance
---
Because MOST Of us want to "play the fucking game" and earn items that aren't trash? 
---
Well played creepy clown dude.
---
I generally do one-two passes a day. Due to the currently weekly challenges, I did more. In all that time, I got no legendary drops. 
---
That's...indicative of yet another nerf. I've never done anything close to that much time in an area over a couple days and not have some legendary spawns. 
---
Works for me just not on a Grognak axe.
---
Yes it does....at max perk it repairs to 200%
---
Thank you for your answer I appreciate it
---
No probs....anytime
---
You can have your space, mutant
---
Even though he killed your kin
---
Go on sit and stay at your lonely table
---
I'll see you around again
---
He shot your face, you didn't move
---
Sunsets fade and nukes do, too,
---
So you can have your space, mutant...
---
The reason I made this question is because of the build I‚Äôm making https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d984d45&amp;d=pd0pk0pl0s40sm0sn0l71lu2a71s71sb1sa1sv1p01ee2ic3ck0e82i43i12ih1ss1se1c70e00pp1pr1&amp;w=i30ia0i50p70p10pa0p80p90ij1ik0ie1at1lj2l60l90ii0if2iq2lm2c61c52cr0&amp;n=The%20SuperFit
---
I guess we know what happened to Oscar the grouch after the nuclear holocaust.
---
Idk why you‚Äôre downvoted, there is only one new quest chain since release
---
The people in this game are really generally helpful. I think it‚Äôs because the fallout community in general are tightly woven and closely related in how much we love the game. The game had a rough launch so those who still play are even more dedicated to fallout and their fellow players. Everyone I‚Äôve meet is super cool and friendly. I actually quite enjoy the players and they‚Äôre sense of player based community.
---
Similar to mine except I only equip weapon artisan when I go to repair bench and I use portable power instead...brings down the weight of your armor......other than that...nice build
---
Can I get marsupial and speed demon
---
Worked on PS4 earlier today... 
---
Most items aren't trash. You can destroy any mobs minus SBQ with 1 star AA/TS/BL weapons if your character's got the right perks. Heck, you don't even need right perks. My rifleman toon's put like 3 points into perception and does about 90 damage per shot with junkie's combat rifle and I eat scorchbeasts for lunch. I understand your pain but that's only because you are after those BE/AAE B/SS items and consider others trash
---
Also have makeshift warrior equipped so melee weps break fown slower.
---
Thanks for the compliment do you play on PS4?
---
Would be funny if the respawn points where inside others camps beds.
---
Some lucky new player is gonna love me when I give them an auto pipe pistol and 3k rounds of .38 later this weekend. 
---
Then later on in their journey realize that .38 ammo is a plague and by handing it off you are just relieving yourself of that disease.
---
Is it where you are standing on the map or where your square indicator thing is?
---
Here's my first attempt: [https://youtu.be/mguQvRiR8Bc](https://youtu.be/mguQvRiR8Bc)
---
Unfortunately, I ended up right by my C.A.M.P. I'll try to do it again sometime soon and I'll upload any follow-up videos also.
---
Iv already seen him at new gad, Watoga, and crevas dam as well. 
---
I thought maybe it was the environment loading up or something graphic-wise
---
Are you talking about the stash box?
---
I agree and it‚Äôs unfortunate that tight deadlines and crunch times and shareholders = games/fans that suffer is the new norm.
---
Speaking of bags... Have people received their proper ones?
---
Yeah it's intended; there's a flag in the datafile that specifically blocks SuperDuper from working and it's applied to the brewery items.  
---
I found a dud there, where you had to choose which wire to cut.
---
It's still got stability problems, but as I thought they clearly are talking to the ESO team. They're doing the things they need to do to keep the game improving while patching (some of) the bugs.   
---
They're going faster, too. Wild Appalachia feels a lot like Tamriel Unlimited as far as development timeline goes. 
---
I have a bottle of tequila from a daily that I haven‚Äôt drank yet. That would be a good one to put this effect on.
---
Pumpkin house quest 
---
You get them from a daily as well as the seeds that let you craft them. The pumpkin house in the NE part of the map is where you get the quest and its a simple quest. So theyre rare in the wild but east to make and get.
---
Dont know why your getting downvoted. Some flora cant survive outside their intendes biomes. Woth that beung said it would be nice to still plant them but only in the biomes they can survive in.
---
And with the withespring floor, bring a whitespring wall and roof set too!  
---
But they are getting better prices in the store, just look at the deathclaw statue vs the power armor statue price. &lt;3
---
The tube is also extended with the barrel length mods isn't it? It would be cool if the function reflected that. Or even a separate mod.
---
I need more Fallout friends anyway you should inbox me your screen name
---
I met a Super Mutant who was [quite happy to have me in his church.](https://i.imgur.com/SoZiETj.gifv)
---
I've got what I need except for the helmet plans I need more Fallout friends anyway inbox me your screen name
---
You can own as many as you can defend.  Some are more difficult to keep than others. 
---
I got mine by having a friend jump off a cliff to his death repeatedly with me waiting at the bottom to revive him. 
---
Wow Fallout 76 PvP looks like shit.
---
When you say legs, do you mean you need them both?
---
Yeah
---
What system are you? I can craft just the right leg but at least it‚Äôs one step closer lol
---
There‚Äôs videos on YouTube on how to get it. Step by step.. 
---
PS4
---
Just updated and jumped in tonight after not playing for a bit. Can‚Äôt aim either. I‚Äôve verified files and tried changing the controls from mouse2 just in case - no difference. Not sure what is going on.
---
It‚Äôs not like a traditional FPS. It‚Äôs different 
---
How do you get the seeds? From the same quest?
---
Okay as long as you have the materials I‚Äôll make it for u! Add me l3ULLY_xKINGx (first character is lowercase L)
---
I will take the rare occurrence from that over automatically losing my workshop I invested caps and resources in.  The ONLY reason to take a workshop is farming resources.  Automatically losing it because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to return  and defend it would be the worst thing. 
---
If someone comes hunting you server hop. 
---
Thanks I really appreciate it, but what materials does it require before we go any further, I‚Äôm lacking on steel so if it needs that we won‚Äôt be able to do it at the moment 
---
Yes. The reward is seeds and 10 grenades. And some other stuff. Its a fetch quest but everything you need is right around the house. 
---
If you can just throw me six springs I got the rest. Just been running very low on springs lol. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I got this quest tonight. I left the game and came back after having dinner and noticed I got a different quest instead. I was glad because I didn‚Äôt know how to do it either after I did all I could.. 
---
Oh ok nice, I can throw you six springs and then some since you‚Äôre covering everything else for me 
---
Omg thank you so much. Just add me and join my world! I‚Äôll be at my camp :)
---
Apparently this is very common in advertising. Licencing the whole song usually pays royalties to the artist, the label, the management, the producers, the engineers, etc. The bigger the names involved the bigger the cut and the higher the fee. On the other hand a recorded-for-purpose cover usually involves a songwriting royalty, and everybody else is just paid for the job.
---
I‚Äôm level 102 and I didn‚Äôt know this. I need to finally visit the pumpkin house. 
---
The pumpkin house quest sends you to get 10 pumpkins. There is a catch.....the pumpkins are near a fissure, which will almost sure sprout a scorchbeast, so be ready.
---
My PSN is Windows95Senpai, it‚Äôs no problem tho thanks again 
---
Do you want to guess how many hundred hours I had in this game before I got my first 1* bloodied weapon? Instigating? Before level 90, the ONLY decent drop I'd gotten was a 1* furious combat rifle. 
---
I'm not just after those epic *** items. I've been farming watoga, a zone that primarily drops 1* gear, because it (used to) reliably drop USEFUL 1* gear. It's where I got most of my unyielding gear (most of which is 1*). 
---
Now, it drops no gear. Or at least, next to no gear. 
---
If you go behind the house theres enough pumpkins there and just off to right side. No need to cross the street or go anywhere near the fissure.
---
Still don't get why my grape mentants didn't high light him...
---
You mean the ones you get after completing the first quest with Biv?
---
I know. I had 2 windmills on top of my house pre-patch. One of them got destroyed and i could not even repair it. Now I have 1 windmill on the roof.  I'm sad. The pair were awesome, but now it's just not meant to be I guess. ;o)
---
None. Check the stations, there's a poster on the wall...
---
Well sh***t , now I know. Thanks üëç
---
Thank you. I have been here before and have been looking for this place
---
Add new content. That's how you address that. 
---
And reducing legendary spawns even further RIGHT at the start of a push of new content was a mind-numbingly stupid decision. "hey, here's new stuff to play with...but you'll get shittier rewards in general while you experience it". 
---
Spoilers. 
---
Find the poster. Complete the quest. Its 90% of the dlc's fun.
---
No idea, if I had to make it bet it would be the draw the line BoS event. I do that one all the time.
---
I would try this, if I had friends.
---
I didn't get plans after finishing it.
---
Well you do not actually get the plans, they should already be unlocked on the bottom of the crafting tab at your camp
---
ill give this a try tomorrow!
---
I had this one yesterday, with rum and crits. If it's registering you drank the booze, but not getting the crit counted, completely disconnect and log back in. Should still have the same daily, but it should register a crit for the quest now. Took me 2 or 3 tries of this, but it eventually counted.
---
I have done Watoga for hours the last couple of days and haven't seen a single legendary. Normally I'd at least be seeing 1s and 2s, now and then a 3\*. Nothing all weekend. Pretty irate that the legendary mobs are spawning MUCH less, and still just as likely to have utter garbage for drops. Why even bother? 
---
Hey my new quest where I click e on a robot everyday is transforming the game! Bethesda good! 
---
Coming up with 1\*bloodied weapon after spending hundreds of hours farming? You are one of the unluckiest guy I've ever seen if you are telling the truth. Still, I don't think devs should change drop rates Just because a player got super unlucky
---
I gave two level 8's plasma grenades today. I went into my inventory and when I looked back at them they were just two piles of green goo. Am I doing it wrong?

Defending workshops from Scorchbeasts have always gotten me 3-4 plans as a reward, if that helps
---
I think they broke it. I couldn't get a respawn today either. I tried there after giving up on Watoga. 
---
Looting was faster but I crashes 8 or 9 times. Specifically when fast traveling to a friend's camp. Other people seemed to have that same problem with her camp.

Ps4?
---
Are we sure this won't be a function of that upcoming legendary trader? Or are they just going to trade X legendaries for a random new one or something?
---
Well they are adding legendary vendors aren't they? Farming's gonna be hell lot easier for sure

I imagine the Voice is the default firearm and each mysterious stranger modifies their own over time and especially by the time they hand it down. It does make it weird that we can't mod it. 
---
Between the revolver, the heavy use of the word 'mystery', and the phantom device,I came to the conclusion that we're mysterious strangers. Of course there's miles of wiggleroom for them to retcon it,
---
Thanks all. Didn't even realise this was an option
---
Look into Throwing Knives and Hatchets. I use those on my "Catch These Hands" melee build and it adds a really fun element to ranged combat with the skillshots while still keeping your main weapon equiped to murder that foolish ghouls who try to bum rush you. I think there is a perk that increases the range by 30%.
---
Nothing feels better than landing a long shot sneak attack with a throwing knife.
---
I am not sure. But, if it is a function, that will be a great upgrade.
---
Hahaha, that's awesome. Bet it took forever. 
---
I would pay real money for a decent bookcase full of books. 
---
There's still so much duped gear. The only thing they got rid of were items that shouldn't be able to stack into one. People need to realize that. Most TSE are still duped. 
---
Are you guys starting a circus?  You should definitely start a circus.

Ah ha, mystery solved. I'll have to pay attention next time I'm crafting.

Heheh, dang yeah took like 1 hour .  The funny thing is I was just about upgrading the camp and I ended up with that .

It‚Äôs believed to be a one for one trading. Still no word on proper 4-5* items. Or going up the scale.

In the nuke zones it really makes the fluorescent colors pop out. For me at least

AFAIK you don't.

Just relogged and it worked, Thanks

I'll be honest it's probably one of my favorite quest lines in any Fallout.

Ok thank you for the info!

Some kind of "CAMP Bulldozer" floor should be doable. Some plain ol' dirt that can be put in an area to make things friggin' flat (And to keep assorted plantlife from sticking through your floorboards!) Just call it "Farm plots" and put it in the Floor options, but make 'em about twice as tall as other floors to let you level things off easier.

Travel to the overseers camp and run north following the road and you should be able to get about 10 fire caps every time using the double flora perk. Then run to flatwoods and run the river for 10 snap tails and 10 blood leaf and you are set. 
---
Quality entrainment and experiences &gt; Mindless or meaningless hours.

Not saying your game time isn't meaningful but it isn't just *time to money*
---
I like where your head is at. 
---
It was working before the update so I'm hoping Bethesda is aware of this and hotfixes it
---
Honestly I would've still reported him/her/them to whatever platform/service your using to play on, I personally don't take too kindly to that kind of word play. There's too many people getting past content filters and it irritates me whenever I see a name like that where it's using profanity in a blatant, unsatyric manor. It's quite obvious they don't give a damn about the TOS and they deserve what they'll get for being reported. But that's just my opinion. 
---
Sounds fun but the stash isn't big enough for all my stuff.
---
I'm on xbox and havent had problems, it's been running better since patch from my personal experience. Just throwing it out it might not be an xbox problem. Hopefully it improves for you soon 
---
agreed. the glorification has me not playing.
---
For the outside switch, just wirecit up like you would normally. For the inside, place the switch on the right side of the door. Make sure that switch is powered. Grab the wire from the inside switch and go to the outside of the garage door and connect the wire, which will just clip through the garage wall.

Launched my first nuke tonight, the second the queen spawned the server crashed, we had fun clearing the silo but man that sucked we didn't get to kill her :\

Yeah it's a little late now I've logged off but it was on PC

same. I have no desire to even log in, I can't stand the glorification of drinking

Despite there being the New Vegas sign in atomic command, and Bethesda recently releasing Sunset Sarsaparilla T-shirts
---
I understand that it‚Äôs frustrating and needs to be fixed, but...3000 of any mat is way too much. Hell, even 500 is too much. You‚Äôll have a lot more room in your stash if you didn‚Äôt have so much.

It happend to to my alt char lvld up to 8 an the point was spent on int aswell
---
Yeah I see why then, it's harder to do on PC because you're using the client and I'm not sure if the in-game report systems allow for offensive username reports. I haven't had to use the function yet but I play PS4 and whenever I see a non-ironic/satiric name I report them because as much as we all get a good laugh out of these names sometimes they can actually be pretty offensive. I ran into one person who got away with using the N-word as his gamertag. And regardless of the fact that I'm white I was rather displeased with his choice. 
---
Where did you log back in at? If it was at your camp, then that would‚Äôve been after you got the armour, and it should still be in your inventory. Otherwise you would‚Äôve logged back in at wherever you were before you got the armour, at that previous server save. 
---
Weapons that gain experience as you use them. Eg: they level up and have upgrades to stats. Boom. solved. 
---
Wanna go full damage? cool, comes at the cost of the other stats. 
---
Its something I've never seen in a game and have always wanted. The mods are kinda cool. But i really like the idea of "learning" the particulars of that weapon/armor. Im more accurate with my crappy old 22 ive been shooting since i was a kid than i am with my buddies far higher quality M14.   
---
In his hands its a damn laser @ 400+ yards. i can barely hit within a foot of my previous bullets landing at 150yd. on my 22 i can practically shoot through the hole i left. prob blown 25k rounds through it over the years.

Looking at the in-game craters from atomic  bombs dropped, it seems fallout was still at Hiroshima/ Nagasaki level atomics, plus surface level impact weapons don't kick up as much dirt as a air bursted weapon would.

*"Im the trash man! Im eating garbage!"*
---
Perks, i have maxed out ammo weight perk and with about 16,000 5.56 it only weighs 15
---
It does get better after you figure out what build you're going for then what perks you need. Had issues for the longest time until I unlocked bear arms for my heavy guns, and found some armor pieces that mitigate the weight issue even more. 
---
This took bloody ages.
---
Just a few tips.
---
Collect both cards and head straight to the dome. If it‚Äôs unlocked don‚Äôt waste your cards following the steps, hop servers.
---
If the dome is locked follow steps to get the keys and hot foot it over.
---
Once you have the keys you keep them. Although server hopping for multiple plans may be a dick move I‚Äôve also found sets there when the dome is already open so they seem to regenerate. It‚Äôs an easy way to pick up duplicates for team mates.
---
I‚Äôll be on (PS4) from around 2pm gmt.
---
Am happy to paint your PA and save you the hours I just wasted, I‚Äôll do it at the dome and will happily hop a few servers if you need plans! Message me stephenbone18.
---
Yeah but that means I‚Äôve gotta:
---
-.
---
1. Gimp my character to carry stuff 
---
2. Can only use one or two types of guns
---
- Deep pocketed armor/ power armor.
---
- Melee builds use no ammo and are the most powerful right now.
---
- If not doing melee, ballistic builds work pretty well too, with the right perks.
---
It's a balancing act and a very doable one.
---
I‚Äôm wearing a power suit, so the armor isn‚Äôt an option.
---
My build was a sniper build 
---
Pretty certain I can do all that for ya. IGN Keithkthomas86
---
I‚Äôm wearing power armor.
---
I took the leap. Found a workaround for both sides of the brick wall so the mirror doesn't clip.
---
What is your price?
---
It could be your PC, i havent experienced any stutter apart from my first load into a world.
---
Hmm, can't really speak for sniper build, but I know batteries included helps me a lot just so I can store a ton of fusion/plasma cores for in my PA. Will say that my weight limit is about 320 outside of power armor, so you may want to go in that direction. Once you get decent armor buffs, the PA can actually have less carry weight.
---
welcome to reddit kid
---
I just bought it. Not sure if this was a patch but it just works on the interior side of the brick wall. On the exterior with jutting bricks, place it on. The run up to it, look at it by the side and grab it by the side to edit, and look away from the wall. This will drag it out of the jutting bricks, and the entirety of the "actual" mirror part out of the wall.
---
I‚Äôve got 33 unspent levels, I‚Äôm currently level 100something.
---
So I could probably change my build somewhat but it‚Äôs gonna be super annoying as I‚Äôm still pretty overweight 
---
Brotherhood paints we're updated and you can get the knight series of paints like Knight SGT and Knight CAPT, new X01 paint but of the top of my head only available new recipes besides them are the brewing ones sadly. 
---
I'm level 110, spent the last 5 or so levels respeccing to get mine just right. Still have one more level on bear arms to go. It's doable, but annoying. Best of luck!
---
If you only have 200 carry weight in power armor, you are doing something wrong.
---
Had the same happen to me after claiming the munitions factory. First defense directly after claiming. Third wave. Server disconnected. I used up ammo, resources and caps and managed to get like 30 bullets out of it. My first rage quit moment. 
---
Nicely done. 
---
It‚Äôs just shit game design, I remember when the weight limit was even lower.
---
Even if I delete most of my shit I‚Äôm not gonna be able to pick up new stuff.
---
What perks are you using/do you suggest to fix this clusterfuck?
---
So what do you suggest I do to fix it ?
---
More strength and calibrated shocks. Also, you don't need to be in power armor full time.
---
No country roads
---
Scorched earth is also next to impossible without the entire server fighting or using exploits, it's next to impossible if only 7-10 people are participating and it doesn't seem to balance based on amount of players. I did the event earlier with that amount of people and barely knicked it's health a fifth of the way down using almost half my .556 from an anti-armor handmade, which is a very viable weapon usually, but did absolutely nothing to the queen, and not even melee can make a noticeable difference in damage. They've "nerfed" scorchbeasts a couple times but I've noticed zero difference in difficulty since launch, they're still spammy, annoying, and never land. I.E. this morning I fought FOUR scorch beasts at once and only 1 landed the entire fight, the other three only landed after death. I'm tired of Bethesda saying they fixed something when they actually did nothing, or they f*ck it up in the very next patch. It makes me not want to play the game because I already receive insane backlash for my RP choices, but the fact that I can't even participate in endgame pve without wanting to shoot myself (I'm lvl 100 BTW) is insane and I can't believe I spent 60$ to consistently regret my life choices. 
---
No take me home
---
Intended. You used to be able to super duper mainframe cores but they turned that off too
---
He also spawns to the east of the Charleston station shop. Never even knew there was an event spawn there! I knew about the vendor bot spawn thing, but not this!
---
If you go across the lake where the bot spawns and look south on the road, this is the spot I'm talking about. Has it always been there?
---
Hey, play what you want, pal. If you wanna move on to another game, then I wish you the best :)
---
üé∂TAKE ME HOMEüé∂
---
Yeah, it something I had to come to terms with real quick, being a mad-hoarder on the previous titles.
---
I must say the perk cards that reduce weight of chems, ammo, food and drink, armor, etc are a life saver.  I'm level 98 and still have about 15 cards slated for weight reduction because I like running around with tons of stimpacks and food/drink and ammo l 
---
For Cary capacity, if you add pocketing to your armor, you can increase your carry weight and if you stick the excavator armor that you craft at level 25 (let I do) then it gives you an extra 100 carry weight.  Then you can get calibrated shocks eventually for your excavator armor and it'll give you another 100 carry weight 
---
 
---
In this case though, with the key cards and dome keys being one to a server kinda killed itself being a community thing. There were too many variables that need to align in order to actually work out, and once someone did figure it out, the exact same thing that did happen, would happen. key and plan hoarding.
---
Bag owner here: no sooner than the end of summer, they've taken time to manufacture these and send out. 
---
How about at Freak Show. There‚Äôs no stash per se but several green golf ball buckets that have loose caps in them and on the table/ground around them. 
---
Prob an idiot at Zenimax, not BGS. But yeah.
---
I want to like the game but after having a camp not work after that I‚Äôve had to completely rebuild and now 3 turrets missing randomly from my new base i‚Äôm beginning to come to the conclusion this game can‚Äôt be fixed. It‚Äôs no fun to waste your time and have to maneuver through a buggy game only to have game breaking ones still happen 5 months after launch. Playing with a friend today was such a chore. It‚Äôs pretty annoying to have it relog every time a bug happens. Any new person who comes back to the game and then has to deal with these game bugs nonstop is going to say screw it and quit again. 
---
How long will it take to fix the new bugs and performance issues that have happened with this new patch? How long until a new patch to fix the new bugs? Like I‚Äôm almost over it. I really am.  I don‚Äôt know how many hours I have in the game but I have a level 120 and 70 so it‚Äôs a lot. I am so over the immersion breaking crap that I have to deal with all the time with fallout 76. I paid $59.99 to preorder this game and I am constantly having to deal with new and unique bugs every time a new patch comes out. I appreciate the new content but you have to fix this game or people are going to give up. I‚Äôm right at the point. 
---
I thought about buying the division 2 which has got great reviews so far because I just want an experience that isn‚Äôt frustrating. It‚Äôs frustrating when you spend money on a game and the game doesn‚Äôt work. I like Bethesda games and I want to like fallout 76 but when stupid things happen that can‚Äôt be explained on a regular it makes me feel like giving up on it. Maybe this game won‚Äôt ever be what I thought it could be. 
---
It's a fun weapon but has it's problems. Careful not to shoot it if it says all your ammo is loaded into it, it can use *all* of your cells in one shot. Would scrap them till you learn the helmet plans anyhow, and maybe you'll find a legendary one by the time they fix the glitches. Oh, and if you ever need the assaultron board for crafting, scrap an assaultron blade.
---
every single time i put something into a frame. Usually just one dupe though. Not like yours did (EG i have 2 of everything on my PA, until i relog)
---
If I leave this game will die.
---
I thought it was the other way around since actual impact kicks all the debris into the air, thus making fallout. I was always under the impression that an air burst missiles had a wider area of effect due to overpressure, which is what Fatman and Littleboy did, and that impact missiles had a smaller AOE, but loner lasting effects. 
---
Will think on it and hit you back later, about to crash out. Just keep in mind I run a heavy gun build. Platform?
---
Look at it that way. I am the guy that stuck around and I have found in life I am pretty normal person so if i am having these thoughts there‚Äôs no way that a lot of others aren‚Äôt thinking the same thing. I want to know what the plan is? Are we going to get a new patch on Tuesday to address all these new bugs or should I just quit. 
---
What if his name is Gaylord Kunt and he's 69 years old?
---
In reality airburst weapons kick up more matter in a wider area due to reflected energy waves. Ground impact goes straight up. Airburst spreads out. Up to 1/3 of energy is absorbed into the earth, where as air bursted bounces. I learned this when I went to c school for the trident missile system

Ernie Maresca, the writer of the Dion song "The Wanderer" is sueing Bethesda for using the song in the game without permission. Most of the songs are eminent domain so they don't have to pay royalties on them. Apparently the Dion song wasn't one of them. Shit like this is why we have limited music in the game. Bethesda doesn't want to get up off of that jack so we can have a better selection. "The Wanderer" was released in 1961 and "Wouldn't it be Nice" was released in 1964 so the timeframe of the songs would be consistent. Most of the music in the game is from the 50's, but some is even from the 40's. Back then, copyrights and royalties weren't a big thing, but as the 60's rolled around, these things became really important. Usually the writer got a set payment for a song and that was it. The copyrights and royalties were added to protect the writer. The singer/band were going to get paid for performing, but the writer got jack shit past the one time payment and that wasn't really fair. Nowutimeen???? ;o)
---
Plus fallout universe is still Hiroshima level atomic weapons. 
---
place it as close to fissure site prime as you can, that is your reward.
---
Can‚Äôt build new turrets to replace the ones that disappeared and I‚Äôm to scared to try moving my camp again to see if it fixes it due to the last one bugging out and not letting me place it again. Camp bugs are the worst and disappearing turrets are a pretty bad one especially now that it says I am at max turrets and can‚Äôt build more. 
---
Just remove the wood armour all together. 
---
I don't know why the hell they thought it was a good idea to add in the first place. 
---
Or a gift emote. Why is there a puke emote but no sorry or gift. 
---
I‚Äôm just a cyber geek for the Air Force. Lol. If you went to school for how missiles work, there‚Äôs no point in debating that. I‚Äôm m smart enough to know when outsmarted. 
---
Thanks for the knowledge bomb...pun intended. 
---
It‚Äôs a question of balance over form,no other barrels in the game increase ammo capacity,barrels affect range,recoil and hip fire accuracy.
---
John Denver released "Take me Home, Country Roads" in 1973 or 1974. Way newer than all of the other music in the game. That song does NOT fit in the timeframe in my personal opinion. ;o)

Hey you may also want to check this out. It is a site where you can move points and perks around to see what the results would be. Can take some time to mess with but may help save time in the long run.

I did get my key. Dome door was open when I got there with plans on the table waiting :)

Thanks, so far players coming across it go for teaming, so I guess it works.
---
No worries. What most people know about nuclear weapons is just from movies and games. The reality is both boring and horrific. Pray if it happens you are in the initial blast radius and of not its ground impact.
---
I wish I could say the same thing and I guess it‚Äôs true it‚Äôs better than it was at launch but it‚Äôs still riddled with game breaking bugs and when it launched it did so in a state that it should have never been released in. 
---
This game isn‚Äôt about hoarding. We gotta let go. I keep mentioning Dead Money from NV but there‚Äôs a lesson in knowing what to keep and not too. 
---
When it comes to weapons. Realistically you only need a primary, a back up, back ups of those. A specialist weapon ie. Something to put down scorched beasts. 
---
Armour comes down to build. Chems and food are found every where. Really only craft and carry what you need for the time your playing. And ammo I do my best to carry an amount equal to a set number of mags my guns can use. 
---
Junk really is preference. 
---
You should just quit. 
---
You saved him from bounty hunters. That's what he wanted, trust me.
---
Oh absolutely. I got to work with some missileers up at Malmstrom for a few weeks. They told me some crazy shit about their weapon system.
---
I‚Äôd much rather go quick like that. Living through the aftermath of nukes would not be fun. Post-apocalypse settings are way over romanticized. 
---
 748250 thank me later
---
Should we be thanking Bethesda for getting the game to a state it should have originally been released in? The game is still quite buggy, although more tolerably so. This is about the state we should see games in at release, not 4 months after release.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the problem is and I‚Äôm also not sure how much you played it since the patch but I just had an all day session with the game and have had one bug after another. The last one I had where turrets randomly disappeared off my camp and won‚Äôt let me rebuild them after having them totally rebuild my camp in the first place is almost enough to make me give up on it. Maybe I should just buy another game and come back in a few months to see if they fixed the new bugs. 
---
Support your local delinquent! LMFAO Too rich! 
---
Radiation poisoning is not what fallout says it is. It's just cancers and fatal, stillborn  birth defects

I'd like to see this kind of challenge as a fixed random one in the game.

Every now and then after a Nukashine blackout you find yourself in the state the OP already wrote down. All your equipped stuff is in a container somewhere far away from your wake up point and you have to get there by the rules posted above (or quite similar). That would be rad! üòÅ
---
I might if they don‚Äôt address these new bugs fairly quickly. It‚Äôs pretty frustrating to have to deal with the bugs over and over again.
---
Just learn how to play the game?!. Or maybe stick to single player games so you're only Cheating yourself üëç
---
If you've finished the Mayor for a day quest, Watoga has 4 power armor spawns. Some are 45 some 50. Took me about 2 or 3 days of casually checking them all to get a full set I needed.

Gosh, I sure hope so.

It's mostly bulking though and that's so you don't create a positive feedback loop out of junk. If you could super duper bulk plastic, you'd never run out of plastic.

Sorry to burst your bubble but I don't raid camps unless it's a personal vendetta. So unless you give me a good enough reason, I won't fuck with your home.

5 cap bounties are like playing a junk slot machine. Sometimes you spend 20 caps fast traveling to someone that just stored junk, sometimes you kill them and find over 200 lbs of bulk junk. It's already an event for some of us.

So just cheat instead... Good plan üëå

Okay but you see here the thing is we have to deal with the same bs, no raider factions are in kahoots with eachother so any raider who's grieving camps is doing it to everyone, not just non raiders, and 90% of grievers I see aren't even raiders, they're just factionless cucks looking to ruin your junk collection.
---
Like I said, cancer and stillborn fatal defects 
---
I‚Äôm trying to make a point here that that bugs need to be addressed ASAP. I get it the creation engine is hard to make work as an online games but the camp bugs are the worst. It‚Äôs frustrating to have your creations bug out. I just want to know when it‚Äôll be fixed. The division 2 looks like it could be fun but I like the dynamic open world RPG element of fallout but I just wish it worked.

Isn‚Äôt hurting anyone

I got it for sale if you don‚Äôt want to go get it your self.

They never hotfixed adrenal reaction. They're probably going to make us wait until the next content drop's patch before they fix it.

True stoty

Watoga.  There's usually a couple legendary robots around the city; one usually by the store.  Then in the Civic center 2nd floor there's always a scorched legendary up there (just got a 2* Gatling plasma tonight up there) and then in the medical center 2nd floor 1/2 the the time there's a scorched legendary on the back side of the baracade.  For the robots in the city, if you kill most of them, then about 5 col gutsys will spawn and come after you and half the time there's a 3* gutsy among them.
---
Where can I get those?
---
I like being in power armor full time 
---
Go to Watoga, there's five there.

You can add me if you like. I'm level 82 at the moment and am more than happy to help lower level players. I can also make stimpacks and rad-aways. Hit me up anytime.  GT is BillyZ1962. And yes, that's the year I was born.  I'm too old for bullshit and will help anyway I can.

Bloodied is legendary effect on weapons so it is random drop

Noice, thanks!

Take over one of the power stations?

I mean, eventually, we don't know how that works, and having drastically lower legendary spawns in general means you're going to have to put in that much more work for whatever you do get out of that.

There are far, far fewer legendary enemies out in the wasteland today than before the patch. 
---
Ok thanks.
---
Once I hit higher levels I‚Äôve been somewhat disillusioned with my sniper build cause it‚Äôs weak.
---
I originally thought there would be pvp of some kind and that I could use it for that, I never really see anyone red with a bounty, so kinda pointless.
---
I‚Äôm fine to change it to other builds.
---
&gt;If you wait like 10 minutes at the stand the recipes are available to purchase again.
---
Why would you want to do that?
---
Likewise, brother.
---
Okay, good for you mate. I hope they learn from their mistakes and fix them. But this is the first attempt with this game. The Division 2 had the first game to build upon, and if you played it at launch you would know it was bug ridden and had many complaints. But they fixed it, and it became a better game for it. Division 2 they already had all the fixes in there and knew what to anticipate.
---
^^^*i think we found the culprit*^^^ \s
---
Have a little read back through the sub and you'll see all of the damage that was done to the player economy through duping... If you really knew how to play the game, grabbing more than enough stimpaks would take 5 mins üëåüëå cheating has no place in an online multiplayer.

Well in that case let me just become the cuck that everyone makes me out to be, I never raided a camp before but if you are all going to accuse me of being a third rate douche I might as well go ahead and fit the bill then shouldn't I? That's obviously what you want. I'm tired of you Assholes calling me out for things I haven't done, you all just assume since I enjoy RPing a raider I'm suddenly the scum of the earth and have a two shot explosive weapon and go around blowing up people's bases for fun. That's not the fucking case. I want to have a good wholesome experience playing as a raider attacking workshops, but nobody wants to join me in doing so because all of you assholes on the internet with nothing better to do than bitch and whine about your lost steel scrap and you instantly blame the 1 faction known for attacking people, instead of realizing that raiders as a whole are not a problem, if you go on the sub for fallout raiders you'll see there that a number of us are trying to become organized as a community between all the raider factions and we're all tired of being stigmatized because you Asshole have less than a single brain cell and jump immediately to "he attacked me, he has to be a raider!" No, they're just fucking assholes, so grow a fucking pair of balls and build your base back up.

You can add me to your group if you like. BillyZ1962 is my GT and I  am on or can be on about any time of the day or night. When you are retired, you can do shit like that. LOL Just add me and hit me up. 
---
Find a map of where they are online, go to a place where one or two are in close proximity and find them and then hop servers and look again. Works for me 
---
Home defense perk is needed to build turrets ljke that after the have disappeared.
---
How did you get power to the trap? No matter what i try i cant get a power line to connect
---
"Its as fun as you make it" 
---
Probly the most accurate thing ever said about this game. 
---
Becoming a literal god in any of the other bethesda rpg titles has an immediate appeal that loses itself within a few seconds. People are too quick to throw out the entire notion that the game is meant to be played and provide fun experiences and substituted with a completely game-wrecking need to be stupidly overpowered. 
---
I've had more fun in 76 than ANY other fallout title simply because of the fact that I can finally share my time with my friends that until this game, I've only been able to share experiences with verbally. 
---
Yes this game needs work... nobody in their right mind can deny that. We all know it and these salty children with nothing better to do than mindlessly drone on about how bad it is only bring more disappointment to themselves rather than bring everyone down with them as per their intention. But ITS GETTING BETTER EVERY WEEK and i look forward to having tons more adventures with my friends and strangers alike. 
---
honest to god i think his ai was bugged because if he were to get up, he'd go through the wall so the game just doesnt let him get up.
---
Were you parked at the whitesprings club house?

It's off and on for me. I notice it a lot after hopping in power armor.

Still up there, grabbed it yesterday

Do you still wanna sell some?

What's the problem with that? If you don't got bloodied weapons, just build your character around what you got. I run junkie build on my alt cause I that's the best I got. Big deal

Thank you for the offer, but I'm on xbox! I wish you wastelanders well!

Thank you for the offer! I'll definitely add you and invite you when you're on.

Haven't crashed since they fixed the dupers. On PC.
---
Playing from the EU, but not sure if that matters? Do we have regional servers? 
---
I'm not a very high level myself, but i just recently got my best friend into the game after I've been playing it from day one by telling him how great the community has been in there. Glad he saw it himself when just 2nd time in world,2 seperate higher level players stopped at random and gave him stuff. Awesome. 
---
Vendor sell them?
---
Not alot of ppl are doing it in the NZ/AUS server so it was easy for me to get the paint no one was even close to the tnt area
---
This post speaks the truth.

I need them gone now just don‚Äôt want to drop them lol

The TNT dome has been around since BETA.  For some reason it's just now becoming popular.

I thought it only had one, I‚Äôll definitely check there to finish my 50 set

the 5 there where nerfed recently to only contain 25% charge. im guessing they changed fusion cores from all "abandoned" power armors
---
Glad to hear that manüëç‚ò¢Ô∏èI've bin playing since fallout 2 lol
---
My bad, I forgot that, only pc :C
---
I myself disagree with this behavior as it is not like raiders in the lore. They did destroy every home and kill every person, as if they did they themselves wouldn't have anything to raid. As well as the fact that you receive nothing from camp attacks. I cannot allow myself to be associated with the likes of you. I, a legitimate raider am sickened by you and your actions as you are ruining the experience for everyone else by causing the awful stigma that plagues us. So thank you Asshole for giving us a bad name. 
---
Also, unbroken toilets and bathtubs, pretty please? I feel like I can hack robots, create history altering antibodies, and launch nukes, I should be smart enough to straighten a toilet seat and prop that tub up with a brick.
---
So FYI there are people offering services to build your camp. If you put time in you will figure out all the work arounds and quirks. For the more casual player this can be difficult.
---
Someone on the marketplace just posted their service for a few hundred caps to help build camps. The other thing is find a good gaming group. The folks in my clan are always sharing knowledge and plans with each other. The plans are a huge deal.
---
I am so bothered by this I considered putting my still in there because it does, in fact, have a sink. 
---
I've usually had a route to run, posted here by another user:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab81e3/fusion_core_farming_tips/
---
Yesterday though, I just took over all 3 power stations and built a fusion generator to power the fusion core generator (bad choice of names guys)
---
That way you don't have to do the quests for starting up the power stations.
---
I left them unlocked, and still got around 15 cores by dropping by every 10min. 
---
Do sorchbeasts even eat ppl
---
Bonk!

Quick tip, when your done with the Brotherhood of Steel questline (when you can get to the top floor at Fort Defiance) you can get a max upgraded hunting rifle recipe from the terminal just before you enter the doors inside the fort, it can be crafted as a lvl 1-5-10-20-30-40-50 version, and you dont need to mod it, so its realy cheap to make.
---
its called "Brotherhood recon rifle", and I have been crafting these for low lvls since a lvl 1 can use it :)
---
Your friends base may have been attacked because everyone wanted the area. It may have been attacked because there was a gathering of people and that usually means a team and people are more likely to fight when they thing they have a chance. People are going to bitch about anything they can. So kill them, take their loot, see them driven from the field of battle and listen to the lamination if their women.
---
Definitely I use 'em, what's your psn name

Just tell yourself there was a rerun on GSN.

We have a friend that just moved here from Australia and were showing him around old lower town. Stopped at Almost Heaven Pub for lunch and found it.

Sometimes the Uranium Fever event marker bugs out to that location aswell. I‚Äôve only seen it since the last patch.  Maybe there‚Äôs gonna be an event there in the future and it‚Äôs bugging the game out rn.
---
1-2 at the exterior place where Uranium Fever takes place. Near green dumpsters. Usually get 2 sometimes 1, rarely none.
---
Whitesprings, near the bunker, guard post, trash bin ~75%.
---
Inside West-Tek, too hard for me to describe I guess. It's on second floor, on a shelf, downstairs has mutfruits and other plants. ~33% chance for me.
---
Red Rocket station in the Mire. Behind the counter ~50%.

I'm my friends and I are having trouble fast traveling on each other. It just will not let us.
---
I absolutely agree. You love Harley Quinn and I have a negative view of Harley Quinn stuff. This is why reddit brings us together. Wether we agree or disagree we just post our views here. :)
---
It's also not my fault that illigetimate bastards are running around ruining the raider name, needlessly destroying people's hard work, and for what? A measly 30 caps and some scrap items? It's kinda bs and I don't see why people do it. It's honestly why workshops exist, to give us raiders something to target. 
---
yes you are being silly cause he isnt here till may 
---
It's unclear on what it defines as witch hunting
---
Today I noticed that I got really unlucky with three star enemies.  I got four while in a whitesprings nuke, and got a drill, syringer, a one star wood chest piece and a slightly interesting [gatling gun](https://imgur.com/DBmfJkM).  I also got another two syringers in the past two days.  One from a single star ghoul in whitesprings (non-nukezone) and another from a 2star gutsy in watoga.
---
The one star wood chest and gatling are pretty normal for multi-star legendaries, but the syringer/drill drop rate seems abnormally high.  Maybe I'm just having a run of bad luck.
---
Seems like it's in Vegas, either your machine's on fire or it's not.  I've been running around whitesprings and watoga the past 3 days and have gotten quite a few legendaries, maybe 30+ over 3 days.  
---
Yesterday, for me, both whitesprings and watoga we're on FIRE üî•, tonight I did get a few but not as much.  I do know the 3rd floor of the Watoga Civic center I always find a 3 star legendary scortched; got a 2* Gatling laser up there tonight. Got a 3* flamer and 3* metal chest piece last night.  Nothing fantastic but got me a little excited.  But yeah, my best legendaries were all from people who put adds on the fallout market. 
---
Seems like our time might be better spent just selling guns and clothing to vendors for caps and then buying from people on the market.  Hopefully the legendary prospector and or player vending will help make it easier to aquire the weapons we want.
---
It‚Äôs a good fix for some camps but if the OP‚Äôs camp is anything like mine then they‚Äôve spent a while building it and there‚Äôs no way the blueprint will work again. This is why I build off the beaten path now so I don‚Äôt have to worry about people getting a bounty for bait at my expense. 
---
You can catapult people with some of the wooden spring traps. 
---
I have been too. Especially armor with ultra light
---
I honestly wasn't surprised by the attack but the fact they had to use broken weapons was the reason I was mad, they had the advantage but still chose to be absolute cucks about it. Every one of them had an explosive combat shotgun at the very least and those kind of weapons just ruin pvp for everyone. 
---
I think mutations are random unless you take a serum and to keep it forever you need the level 2 starched genes perk 
---
Go or stay,no one really gives a damn.But one things for sure,this post won‚Äôt make any difference....it‚Äôs not like they are gonna say,‚Äùoh no! Random joe blow is almost ready to quit! We better get on this ASAP!‚Äù
---
It's true though. -$60
---
I don't think you can accuse others of salt flying out of their mouths when you literally accuse someone of not "being better" when they make 100% accurate point.
---
I'm on PC and since this patch the stability has gone backwards, I'm getting fairly regular crash to desktops which I haven't seen since several patches ago.
---
Yeah just scorchbeasts. Vats build is op atm
---
All fallout games are awesome!
---
I just hope that for the next sp Fallout they dont dumb down skill and conversations
---
Starched genes 2* prevents your from losing it.
---
Serums are the only way to get a specific mutation. (If you're on pc I sell them. Discounts for bulk. 300c starting price)
---
You can get irradiated to hell and mutate 1x per server.
---
 Eg stand in water. Get mutation. Equip starched genes2, rad shower, server hop. Repeat.
---
Can be dangerous though. Some mutations kill specific builds. If you're ranged, twisted muscles or talons basically kills the char.
---
The class freak perk reduces most debuffs to extremely manageable levels. (Eg -4 strength from marsupial becomes -1 with 3* CF)
---
Then you do not need to carry around normal armor, since you are not wearing it underneath anyway.
---
That's just radiation kicking in. some immersion at last
---
Easiest way is to take the Serum. When you do there is a perk card in luck called Starch genes. What it does is allow you to use radaway without losing it and you keep it forever. I can give you one for free when I‚Äôm on mate. Hope I helped. Oo also there if a perk card class freak which when u have it maxed and on suppresses all the negative effects of mutation. Cheers mate.
---
So whats the point of the fermenter? Craft beer only to turn it to normal beer with no effects? 
---
Aww shit it's May not March? lol my brain must of read that wrong
---
That's the point. you can craft booze.
---
Some people use it normally same as whiskey 
---
the fermenter allows your crafted booze to ferment into usable booze. it also works with some of the new booze recipes you get from Biv. E Ridge
---
You'd think the radiation would be nice enough to complete the haircut and just make me bald all around.
---
1500 pounds over your character's carry weight
---
Stash box is 800

I am Looking for the recipe for lead champagne, any help would be greatly appreciated.
---
Raiders destroy camps and steal junk, are you sure you understand what a raider is...? What you're complaining about is people whining about there being pvp and pvp inbalance. (now the only ridiculous gun is the tesla rifle)
---
This post is why many people criticize fo76.
---
Ok, well thats lame, i have no reason to craft beer as my camp has like 5 beer spawns üòÖüòÖ
---
Never seen one and I think it's intended. that would be way too OP in certain situations. You don't see quad fat man for same reason 
---
I don't see your hatred for explosive. Just a little secret between us raiders. Even if someone has rank 5 demo expert, that only adds 10% damage. So get weapons with vats crit damage. Use stealth boys and Fuck their shit up. 
---
I‚Äôm only saving 3 stars and above. It‚Äôs so far away and no one knows yet how the trader works.
---
This post nails my feelings on the game as well. Fallout 76 is my dream game to be honest. Games like Anthem/Destiny/The Division bore me to the point of not even playing them because they are so obviously constructed with a set loop in mind, buy game, go through story, try and get better gear and thats it. Those games are so clinically precise with how they want you play them that you can predict exactly how your 50hours of time with it will unravel.
---
Fallout 76 is far more open with its loop, you can tackle it any way you like just how a proper Bethesda game should function. When I started in the Beta I had no idea that 6 months later I would be living in a swamp making moonshine for a robot who's brain has been floating in beer for 200 years.
---
If I picked up the division 2 today, I can already see how if I were still playing in 6 months I would just be a slave to the same old loop of shoot guys to get gear with higher numbers. No thanks, not anymore.
---
it also works with the new recipes you get from Biv. ones that are either rare. or impossible to find in the world as drops. like the High Voltage Hefe
---
Mutations are random. You'll need rank 2 Starched Genes (luck) on basically all the time so that radaway doesn't remove it. With that card you can take all the radaway you want. you should only take Rad-X diluted since regular Rad X will make you jump like normal, or even less in my experience. 
---
As mentioned already you can buy the mutation you want from the bunker vendor or from a player here. Most of us sell our serums at 100 caps. You take it once like any regular drug and it stays until you decide to remove it (by taking off your perk card and consuming a radaway). 
---
Well it lets us defy gravity with those mutations so why not lul
---
So is a Double The Dragon not a thing too?
---
They are indeed random.
---
Though RNGsus knows what you don't want, and will give you that one often.
---
(I farmed for marsupial, then took serums for the rest. Had to ditch talons and twisted muscles prob 100 times before I got it)
---
store the floors you used to put your turrets on, they should appear in your stored tab, that's how i fixed that bug in my camp 
---
I apologise.
---
Never seen one. I doubt it exists
---
Thanks for the tip. I have a hatred for the explosive weapons because of the splash damage being ridiculous even In power armor. I found myself getting 2 shot in full X-01 from time to Time when i encounter these types of people. 
---
You can't vendor ammo
---
Those weapons can only shoot one round so Quad would be odd
---
It works
---
Yeah..me too. I have a pile of 3 stars saved
---
Furious -&gt; more damage if hitting same spot.
---
Explosive-&gt; area of effect (aoe).
---
No. They do not cancel out.
---
Boost your explosive damage perk card for more *bang* (explosive damage from gun WILL hurt you if you are in aoe)
---
I picked up the scarecrow plans from one of the responder vendors (Charleston Station I think), and since using them my crops rarely get attacked by molerats. Planted about 10 each of mutfruit, corn, tatos, carrots and placed 2 scarecrows per side. Haven't lost crops since. At least that's my experience so far. Anyone else?
---
Do you forget and leave lone wanderer on? 
---
Reminds me of that time I saw a bunch of rats following an eyebot playing patriotic music by my base 
---
I wish the camp stash were higher. No one can deny they only real reason that is there is for server stability reasons.
---
But I agree with lowering the character weight limit. Did you play fallout 4‚Äôs survival mode? The carry weight in that game was bellow 100. 
---
It causes you to think about your build and make interesting decisions. 
---
I know what a raider is, but there's literally no use In attacking a player camp, and those doing so are just making other players harass people who rp as raiders, as I stated In my post yesterday I received heavy backlash after suggesting to our other players that they do not have to sit there and let they're camp get destroyed and themselves get killed, but since I dress like a raider and call myself one I'm apparently immediately "everything that's wrong with fallout 76" as everyone made it very clear in they're comments. Workshops are the only things worth attacking because most camps won't even have an extractor or farm nearby to make attacking the base worth the bounty you receive. 
---
Nice. So I can hit a scorchbeast from far enough? And it won‚Äôt get canceled even with the demolition perk? With both furious + explosive for example?
---
I thought they changed the rate there made to hourly??
---
Johnny Cash - "When the man comes around"  
---
Would be a perfect fit for fallout, also if theyre releasing the 4 horseman of the apocalypse power arnor paints it fits even better
---
I remember GTA5 online used to have this glitch with all its masks which meant that when you wore one it deleted your hair to prevent clipping but when you took it off you were permanently bald!
---
No. The two will not cancel out
---
That's really disappointing. Crafting beer feels like cooking, so I was surprised things didn't double.
---
I mean 1 \* 4 is still 4 so that just my thought process
---
Its a good idea. 
---
I think the 10xlv amount is about right. It makes it so that there is at least a 50 cap minimum to each event which I think is about on par for regular events. 
---
I actually think a team being involved should add to the bounty award. The caps lost could even be shared among the team.
---
Beyond that I would suggest specific legendary gear types as an incentive reward for completing such events. The Wanted side for instance could get raider specific stuff while the other gets gear leaning towards BOS or maybe something new.
---
If you really want to push your idea you should tag the Bethesda Community managers. 
---
Sounds like someones a little butthurt that I pack my raiderHater everywhere.  Turns out they're just as allergic to highspeed flaming lead poisoning as everything else in the wasteland.
---
My AR or sniper (neither are explosive) will hurt more, from a lot further away. Most bounties never even see me coming.
---
Max explosive expert adds ~15% to total dmg (60% of 25%) eg: not worth it after the nerf.
---
Thx!
---
Fyi furious builds per hit. Explosive stays the same per hit
---
That is your own fault to be unwilling to acknowledge the weight management that they want you to be thinking about. This is soon to be called ‚Äúadventure mode‚Äù but it‚Äôs always had survival mechanics by default. Did you play fallout 4‚Äôs survival? Less than 100 carry weight. It makes for more interesting gameplay if you only let it. Don‚Äôt be stuck in your old hoarding ways.
---
Nice.
---
We need both!!
---
I can understand cores and some high-end stuff. But consumables that only last 5 minutes? Seems like a poor design choice not allowing them to double.
---
Clearly, they were BORN in 1969. Youre obv not an "internet 90s" kid.
---
got recipe yesterday from the Biv daily. 
---
favorite your Hazmat suit. Then its one button press (i mean youre gonna spam the hell out of it, but hey 1 button)
---
You can counter assass sentinel in SO MANY WAYS. If you're going to have a problem with something direct your attention to tesla rifles, especially automatic
---
I'd like to know too.  Asking for a friend...
---
Few minutes ago was dealing with a lol 49 i think trying to fight me (lvl 13). I ignored him since he was only doing slap damage. He gave up eventually and looked on the map to see where he went and apparently he went to antagonize another low lvl player.
---
I have just returned to the game with a new build and would love to visit your camp.   Please pm me with your deets if this is cool with you.  Cheers. 
---
That'll do, kaishakunin. That'll do.
---
Definitely Harper's Ferry. Unfortunately, I spaced out and forgot to check elsewhere. My bad. Pretty sure about Watoga though.

I just bought the heavy combat armor plans myself and had the BOS combat armor legs drop from a treasure map. I haven't got everything unlocked yet, but I've started. Happy to give you a hand.

Are you guys going to be approachable preachy followers, or "HEY LOOK IT‚ÄôS ALIVE! LETS BLAST IT WITH OUR GAMMA GUNS!" followers?
---
I'll be your friend for a dollar.

Not only that but passing out plenty of dirty water to just bask in the taste of Atom our mighty savior.

I think I mentioned this.
---
"lel"
---
Fuck that.
---
Hard mode. Don't use your map
---
Yes me do it
---
You best pack up now then. It‚Äôs not going to be a game for you, and that‚Äôs cool.
---
Very cool.
---
Being able to hold fuck all isn‚Äôt a challenge, it‚Äôs a buzzkill limitation as it doesn‚Äôt inspire creativity or lateral thinking, it just limits what you can do and use.
---
Server stability, don‚Äôt make me laugh.
---
Doubling the amount of pixel storage in everyone‚Äôs box wouldn‚Äôt hurt the servers, especially considering the decline in population since release.
---
Mmm, Fallout 76 is along the lines of "Oh shit, we've been taking WAY too long on this game. We gotta get some returns on this quick! Sell the game! I don't care what state it's in!"
---
See also: Crackdown 3, Sea of Thieves, Anthem, Destiny, and No Man's Sky.

Seems they increased them accidentally imo ü§´ stock up when you can 
---
I've noticed that anyone who responded to this question with a negative answer got severely down-voted. What's going on here? 
---
Is this a concerted effort by Bethesda or the fan-boys to create a false impression of this game?  Yes, this game IS in an 'early access' state.  It's empty and boring.  If you try to repress this information you are deliberately trying to mislead this consumer. 
---
Your new crop of moderators seem to be working out REALLY well. Is this reddit for fan-boys only now?
---
The game is still poor.  Stop trying to silence legitimate criticisms.  I would like to bet that a fan-boy is running multiple accounts to down-vote honest criticism.  An IP check is in order. 
---
Are you on PlayStation 
---
While technically being true, ‚Äúyou can play fallout 76 just like a single player fallout‚Äù just means you‚Äôre playing an inferior game. The multiplayer is what makes it better than a FO4 West Virginia mod.
---
If you are going to down-vote legitimate criticism, at least have the balls to reply first, coward.
---
Check the markets I think I've seen one before. At least a double. 
---
Woah yeah just noticed that's a little odd
---
Exactly right. Whoever down-voted this comment did not do so for honest reasons. 
---
I‚Äôve never been more glad I got on Reddit at 3am 
---
Yes: Liodred667

---
I have a two-shot The Dragon I think. 
---
Yes, that's my take as well.  This was down-voted by a fan-boy, or by Bethesda, no doubt. 
---
Looks tasty ! How was it ?
---
easiest way is to buy them from me.  i sell for 250 caps each.  PC.
---
Place a door mat under it, saw it in a tutorial that usually seems to work 
---
I already played a lot before, it wasn‚Äôt an issue cause there was the pocketed item glitch.
---
This now is just fucken cancer.
---
Yes. I agree. There was no legitimate reason to down-vote this post, except for fan-boydom or to silence legitimate criticism.  I suspect skull-duggery.
---
This is basically my camp already located next to Whitesprings. Figured there was no point in locking anything away so anybody can help themselves to whatever they want at it 
---
You didn‚Äôt remember when all the duper‚Äôs had the servers bloated? Stuff was way worse then and it‚Äôs funny that people already forget that. 
---
And How is being able to hold everything a challenge??? With limited weight I need to make interesting choices like actually thinking about the junk and whether I need it. Or maybe I‚Äôm going to mod my shotgun to actually be lighter instead of just dmg like always. 
---
All i see is you being cranky that you can‚Äôt have everything like you are used to.
---
Once you get used to stash management that‚Äôs not so bad either. Most people don‚Äôt nearly need as much junk as they have. Unless it‚Äôs steel or screws or something, bulk your stacks down to 100 and sell everything else. When will you need 500 leather? 
---
If you're PS4 I will sell you a serum for 200 caps.
---
bar stools are available.

Fallout 4 hasn't been out for 4 years...
---
But where are them tables to match
---
I agree.  I can't seem to build a radio that plays West Virginia Radio, either, as I had in Fallout 4. There were some really good songs on that one.  The radio I can build on 76 seems to mainly have the free access music which was on Diamond City Radio in Fallout 4.  To be honest, I thought the music would be better on FO76. I feel a bit misled.
---
Being a huge ESO fan I was hoping fo76 was just a reskinned ESO.
---
I think it is a money issue.  The money they use is 'Free Access' Royalty Free music.  It's not very good. Most of these songs I was already sick of on Fallout 4. 
---
So instead of learning to adjust and compromise you depended on a glitch and now you are mad at the game because the glitch doesn‚Äôt work???
---
Just leave now man.
---
I built a surprise decontamination arch. Surprise! You now have no rads!
---
Still, we're in West Virginia now. The music should be different and more local.
---
Does that make scorchbeasts golbats And SBQ crobats then?
---
Just wanted to add that stuff in general is much easier to come by in this game compared to 4.  So not only do many players have more stuff than they really need but the stuff is also easier to acquire than they realize.
---
Radio station mods are good but I want to build a radio for my CAMP with a decent West Virginia/Appalachia song list. 
---
If you wait to finish them till level 50
---
You get a capped full set of ultracite power armor
---
(it's rubbish and you won't use it, but eh)
---
I forgot to mention that! I like the that the injury noise plays when players walk through. Had one guy show up and just go back and forth for a couple minutes through the arch.
---
I'll sell you one for 2k. Just give me a heads up if interested 
---
I've seen quite a few in the Whitespring area, definitely popular! I reconsidered setting up there due to it being a main spot to nuke.
---
The game removed all my camps. Decided they were no build zones. 
---
Costs way to much to repair pretty often but nice seeing players of all levels using it 
---
Why not a country radio station with a quest linked to it and it's run by a robobrain dj
---
Honestly I pvp... Never. But why aren't people using rocket launchers and what not? Do they just not pack enough punch?
---
I came here today hoping for an answer to this question also :(
---
If it‚Äôs 3 star and doesn‚Äôt weigh too much it‚Äôs been thrown in the stash in advance, doesn‚Äôt hurt to be prepared lol
---
I read in a different post that the issue might be with moving your camp device after placing it, which is something I always did. So instead of picking it up and tucking it behind my house or whereever, I placed it, haven't touched it, and my camp has not been destroyed for two logins now.
---
Actually, plant holders are already in the game. Devs just need to add them as constructible objects, so the players can build them at workshops. It's literraly matter of 5-7 minutes if you have Creation Kit.
---
That was the first thing i heard when I turned on Appalachia radio
---
Oh that‚Äôs pretty cool I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks!
---
hope it helps:

I‚Äôm on Xbox also and I get freezes in the normal environment every now and then for a few minutes at a time. In nuke zones it‚Äôs another story... it‚Äôs a complete mess. Constant lag, unresponsive server, audio not synced with what‚Äôs happening (heard a mini gun nonstop and nobody nearby) everything and everyone frozen but I was still running around the queen. Last but not least the game crashes to the home screen.
---
Generally it‚Äôs smoother it seems, nuke zones on the other hand.. completely unplayable.
---
Why not both ? you can enjoy multiple games at any time of day .
---
too much weight for too little payoff. 
---
And proper explosive weapons (not legendary weapons with the explosive mod) arent affected by the EE perk. EE perk only touches weapons with the Explosive mod.
---
Were you able to find it in the frat house? I've been looking for it
---
Honestly, I can't remember where I got it from. I stopped playing a few months ago and just came back, I've had it since then. Probably got it as an event reward.
---
I still manage to horde, I have max strength, Excavator power armour with calibrated shocks, batteries not included perk for fusion core weight mitigation, travelling pharmacy 3 for chem weight mitigation, thru hiker 3 for food weight mitigation, I then use bonus carry weight foods such as cramburgers and radstag steaks if I‚Äôm on a big scavenging run along with alcohol to boost strength and therefore carry weight
---
On males, you can see a gap between the cap and the sides of the head, but only from the front.
---
I've even tried stretching my guys head, but it doesn't work, since the issue is with the Cap.
---
Ahh I gotcha, yeah probably an event reward. Thanks!
---
YES. I would love some Patsy while I wander the wasteland.
---
You literally posted bragging about playing like a griefer and an asshole soooo...I don't have sympathy for you
---
Yeah I've noticed other hats don't have this issue. Not sure if it's just baseball caps in general, though, because I've never worn one besides the VTU cap.
---
These two things are always how the game was though.  Limited inventory is one of the game's mechanics.
---
A real raider wouldn't cry like a little bitch
---
Genderfy, haha! ;)
---
You say you sold him that shotgun beforehand, it's entirely likely that he pulled it out to shoot it to see how it feels and does when shooting, and might have assumed he was in pacifist, since he put the gun away very quickly and was surprised. He took his armor off and didn't fight back? He wanted you to kill him, you did exactly what he wanted. No need to worry

I cleared some of my mutations yesterday to remove plague walker as it was damaging my Brahmin and lost speed demon, I thought I‚Äôd wait before taking a serum to get it back and I‚Äôm glad I did because my movement speed doesn‚Äôt seem that much slower and reloads are only a tiny bit slower than before and I don‚Äôt have to constantly eat and drink now so I think the benefits now don‚Äôt outweigh the negatives
---
A true champion of the vault!
---
I'm disappointed that they didn't add a few new perks along with brewing. I feel like it's an awful lot of effort (I have no farm) to create some of these drinks for a three minute buff. 
---
Horrible, mate.
---
Important announcement: the game will live on without you. Bethesda doesn't care if you specifically stop playing. You're not that special. So just go.
---
Needs more Hatchet.
---
I really missed fallout's old Jazz radios...
---
What platform are you on? I'd give you mind (PC).
---
Thanks I am not n Xbox one. 
---
Sorry bud. I could have modded that yes. PS4. 
---
You sound unhappy. Are things not going well in your life right now?
---
There's already some there, dude...
---
Yes, unfortunately I've experienced a lot more server not responding / dc's after the latest patch. 
---
Scorched Earth event also pretty much broken for me (no loot from the queen or event). Happened too many times, total waste of resources.

Hi there. Send me your PSN name and I will add you. I'm looking for legendary 2 shot explosive weapons and a 3 star fast melee knife if you can help.

Yup ...

I'm pretty sure I killed a guy who was defending my base from mole rats; a stray bullet from his weapon hit one of my possessions. I wasn't aware of this until I'd killed him and inspected the damage... Oops.
---
Yes it can! I found two extras yesterday, one for my teammate and I sold the other
---
my graphics settings were changed to all in max with the last update, check if that's been the case for you too
---
Oh ok
---
Sorry about that! In my own defense, OP didn't specify a quantity, and Biv hadn't given me that quest. Still, sorry . . .
---
They increase your stealth skill, they stack as well, all my bits are chameleon and I can literally touch an enemy and they won't see me.
---
üò≥
---
I've had a scarecrow for months but it's never been attacked. Enemies patrol the road it's placed on from time to time and I've never seen them react. 
---
I have seen my Super Mutant neighbours attacking my flock of flamingos though. Doesn't happen often, but it's great when they prioritise a plastic decoration (of which there are dozens) over me. 
---
Jason bright and his followers launching into the vast unknown 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure the only ones that can't be learned are the x01 mods all the others there is a plan for.
---
Got mine in like 5 minutes without the keys, was the first day tho 
---
Hmm. I did take my excavator of a frame I dropped while giving a friend some power armor, and then put it on another frame.
---
Only my legs "duped" as well, which was the weirdest part to me.
---
&gt; But today again ***I have to*** 
---
I only just picked up the game to try it, but I'm almost positive they won't ban you from playing if you don't do the daily challenges. Relax, games are meant to be fun, easy solution: don't do the daily challenge if they sound unfun to you that day.
---
Not for me whenever I return to my camp mobs are attacking everything but the scarecrow. Could just be a coincidence that enemies AI decided to hit the scarecrows.
---
Ahh okay, does this mean you also need a high agility for sneak? 
---
Located next to Whitespring Station, my CAMP is a lovely diner! I have cafe tables and kitchen chairs on the inside with a bar made of dressers. Brick walls, diner doors and a jukebox help the aesthetic while a standing piano and tuba give players a chance to get well tuned. Upstairs are four bunkbeds for the well rested bonus, some seating for comfort and RP purposes, a grand piano (my private room is very nice and cozy, located off the side).
---
Out on the road is a large tent with all the workbenches in or around it, along with a stash box. On the hill, behind the billboard, are tatos, corn, mutfruit and razorgrain along with two water purifiers (adhesive farm, basically) and a brewing work bench for making booze.
---
People actually use it, which is great, and one guy saw me behind the bar and bought a beer and some lemonade off me! It's more fun for me to build open CAMPs than to make impenetrable fortresses, though I've nothing against people who enjoy the latter
---
It does help yeah, I have made agility as well
---
So badass.
---
Okay thanks! Just getting my head around how perks work etc 
---
There's a place called "Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp" on the west side of the map that has several piles of chopped up logs (the kind for firewood). Equip Woodchucker, which is under the luck perk line, and you'll net something around 250 to 400 wood in 30 or so seconds. Pretty ridiculous.
---
Down south and on the west side of the map, just outside the cranberry bog area is the "Lucky Hole Mine". Has an absolute TON of lead ore, and about half that in raw crystal. If you have the acid to smelt all the lead, it's 1500 lead. Maybe even 1700.
---
Just about an inch north of that mine is the Monorail Elevator. On top of that elevator there's like 7 bags of concrete. Take the elevator on the west most side. At the bottom of this elevator there's also a skeleton sitting on a chair and near a basket that can spawn several firecaps, and is located on a foundation piece on the east most side of the elevator on the bottom of the cliff.
---
The "Abandoned Bog Town" workshop does have deposits for concrete, but one of the multi story buildings in the center of the town and I believe is adjacent to the workbench area, there's a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor with around 12 bags of concrete.
---
A great place for glass or just beer bottles for molotovs is at the "Pleasant Valley Cabins". There's a room that's I think you can only access via some steps outside, and the building is located on the outer edge of buildings. Has like 45 beer bottles.
---
The parks in this game are also pretty decent for beer bottles.
---
Don't underestimate ore deposits. They'r actually the quickest way to get a specific material, but you do have to server hop. Find a location with several nodes and repeat over and over (also helps to have the Excavator power armor on for additional ore yield). Also always equip "Super Duper", which is also under luck, for the chance at additional material.
---
The Morgantown Highschool also has tons of plastic.
---
There's a school in Grafton with a gymnasium, and in there is a closet and 2 carts that can spawn dozens of kickballs, and there's also other sports equipment. Great for rubber.
---
Parks are also great for rubber, and they all have several basketballs.
---
If someone could provide me with an effective acid farm, I'd appreciate it.

Normal floors to attach to foundation floors for when the ground slopes away. 1/2 height stairs. Full width stairs. 
---
Also balloons &amp; placed junk like teddy bears and gnomes.

I thought I read if you give it 3 1 stars it will spit out a random 3 star.

Will go see if I can find that again

Hm... I never wear mine. And I don't want to just drop it. Too much sentimental value, y'know? I would part with it. For a price, obviously. But I'd sell for a bit under the recommended asking price, so it'd be a bargain at least. I won't be on for a while, though. At least twelve hours. If you can wait, I think we can do business?
---
I'll give my gamertag when I get on, you'll probably have gotten help by then. Consider me a last resort, I guess
---
I'm also hoping we get Uranium since hearing it on the latest trailer. It's also introduced me to a whole new genre of cold war classics, and they NEED to be on the radio!!
---
As long as ur crouch they can not vats you. 
---
Theres TSE The Dragon. Use to have one. Traded it for some armor.
---
Thank you very much! Definitely gonna check out these areas.
---
Just curious-- do the quests persist through relogs, or do you have to talk to Biv again to get it back?
---
Thank you! Appreciate this a lot.
---
‚ÄúFor every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs the most specific official statement I can find. That makes it sound like more stars is better. It‚Äôs still not too specific but based off of that I‚Äôm just going for most stars.
---
I try to but they just run away and I‚Äôm only level 40

South of the Tattoo Parlor, on your map you see a letter "T" as road (the backyard of the most south houses of morgantown).
---
I'm on PS4 and I have noticed a massive improvement post-patch. Still not perfect though - regular framerate drops in larger areas and stuttering when the game is loading the next area. Aside from that, I'm having much more fun with the game now. Events are working properly, server sync seems much more snappy, and the new content is pretty interesting too. A good update in my books. 
---
I just hope they can keep this up with each new one. 
---
Your mindset is not getting any better with that attitude.
---
Fermentable Lead Champagne.   Craftable in the Brewing Station.
---
Requires:  3 Boiled Water, 2 Lead, 1 Nuclear Material, 3 Tarberry, 5 Wood.
---
Recipe is given by Biv E. Rage (robot in the tattoo parlor) on random chance day so that you can make one for him.  May or May not be able to get the recipe somewhere else, but I haven't seen or heard of anywhere.
---
When I say a community thing. I dont mean a single server working together, I mean the entire subreddit. Sure thered be competion, but thered be no solving this without helping one another on the forums.
---
I would also need someone to carry me through the SBQ fight. I am on PC and I am willing to share stuff if you need anything I have at all. 
---
And this is why people are farming it, to sell to players like you. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle. 
---
For you maybe its not fun, but theres plenty of folks who do enjoy these things and they were robbed of it.  It would have been eventually solved by the people who enjoy this sort of thing and then everyone would know how to get their paint. But now a major piece of content is no more.
---
No, the helmet is not in Fallout 76. Everyone saying they have "found it" are clearly lying, however it might be in the game in a later update 
---
Fallout 4 hasn't been out for 4 years yet, but nice try. 
---
Try to do the mission anyways
---
Nice!  I do the same with the Brotherhood Sniper Rifle.   Every new server I craft a lvl 1 version,  pretty sweet stats for a starter, and leave it on the responder corpse near the vault with at least 100 ammo.  Aside from one time where a lvl 1 ran from me upon seeing me I'd like to think it's a nice surprise. 
---
Yup!  At Camden park one was in the shopping cart, I killed it, went flying in the air, and came down in said shopping cart upside down with its legs cocked at weird angles.  I remember spitting coffee.

Sure, i will be on this morning for a while, then this afternoon. GT W0GB0T

Power armor means flat damage resistance. Legendary armor effects means contextual damage resistance. Contextual, if played right, should and does outperform noncontextual. At no point in time there was a problem with explosive weapons - prenerf you didn't need god-tier gear to survive few shots. Now you don't need god gear to survive few dozens shots which is ridiculous. Smack some dense mod and get a fireproof perk and it will now negate most of explosive damage. I was sporting full assasin cavalier set pre-nerf. Now I don't need it to survive. I have two assasin cavalier pieces, one assasin sentinel, one regenerating cavalier and one chameleon sentinel - it now gives me enough protection to ignore most of the damage both while sprinting and while standing still. If anything, I do believe TS should be put back into its place just as demo expert should be.
---
Railing.
---
Like 1/4 wall sized, white bars. Able to see over/through but stops player falling off the edge of a platform.
---
You're missing the whole damn point. No single person was supposed to solve this thing! No small group was supposed to solve this thing. This was a crowdsourcing puzzle for an entire community to suss out!
---
 Avoiding spoilers accompishes nothing because its impossoble to solve on your own. Working with others is built into the puzzles difficulty. Its the puzzle equivilent of a 100000 man raid boss.
---
Ok so I'd pay you BUT just to crouch menacingly roughly 100 ft away at all times while I played with my group.  Just to freak them out would be worth it.  Bonus if youre in a bush.
---
Very sassy, I approve
---
I am on now GT evil chugglet
---
yeah it is, I was collecting plastic there
---
Perhaps it's really bugged. In the video I saw the player was standing close by, but not on the ground, and the mob went straight for the scarecrow, attacked it, and even started circling it a bit.
---
I tested it a second time with another ghoul, and this time I just jumped on top of a small building about 15 meters away from the scarecrow. About 1 second after being on top of the building, the ghoul immediately ran for the scarecrow and destroyed it in 3 hits.
---
I tested it a second time, but with a vault girl statue. Jumped onto the building again and it went straight for the statue, and ran like hell after destroying it.
---
So what I've gathered from this is that there's a potential strategy to protecting you crops. Do not place fences/walls around your crops, and crops might be considered a non-priority object to destroy. So if you make a field of crops, place a few random objects near or in them, they'll go straight to them after jumping onto an area they can't get to (like a roof). And also maybe scarecrows only work on animals, but that doesn't seem likely now. So this might just be an ai abuse trick.
---
Heck yeah, I'm totally into this. From the sounds of it you're already running it like a wasteland entrepreneur! I had a regular who had a [whole shop setup](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498856718705360907/527532330479255602/Grinders_Shop.png), but he hasn't returned since update 5 I believe. Would be heck for him too, since he has well-over the 1500 limit in vendor items.
---
But... can you launch a 90kg projectile 300m?

Apparently... It just boggles my mind how many people dont understand how this is supposed to work... Oh well..hopefully beth does a better job hiding the data next time.

We have proximity on console.
---
Oh! Didn't know that.

This is the internet. Have you been here before? If it exists, we find it.  One of these lovely people who've already answered you, or someone else woulda been "look what I found. " at some point.
---
Just bought the game and noticed I‚Äôm pretty much stuck at 72 frames. I‚Äôve tried lowering the graphics settings (they were on ultra) to medium and ended up with a capped 30 frames. Is vsync on by default in this game? Is there a way to turn it off? 
---
Tbh I wish there was a sorry emote too, quite a few times now I've accidentally shot a player caught up in the cross fire and wanted to say sorry.
---
Luckily just doing the heart or hi emote has worked to pacify an annoyed player but sometimes that hasn't worked and they've killed me for it lol
---
I won't be on for a few weeks but thank you 
---
He's waiting for his brother Grahm, he went out looking for meat.... never to be seen again.

You're right, I checked IGN's review and all they said was "2/10 not an Activision game" and linked to this post.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
I would rather we had a chance to actually enjoy the puzzle. 
---
Datamined or solved organically the same thing would be happening. Instructions would be available and people would still hoarde the things.
---
  The difference is that a major piece of content wouldnt have been skipped over because of people hungry for internet points. :p

High Resistance doesnt do as much as most seem to think. In assassins gear i can have \~50 resist, and we're taking the same damage. With basic 1\* gear (100 resist from armor, another 124 from perks &amp; mutations) Im taking about 60% of the damage you are. 
---
You'd need to get your resist to \~1650 to compete with 5 assassin pieces+lone wanderer. (and thats with the PA user running LW. (without it you'd need over 3850 resist to stay on par.  
---
It's not a very profitable business, but I get my caps through fair trade with the fine vendor bots. And occasionally you get somebody willing to trade big caps.

Once player vending machines come out, my Nuka-Cola machine's getting kicked to the curb so I can sell my excess plans, chems and booze.

I hope your regular finds some way to keep his business going. Trade is the way we're gonna rebuild America!

Then this puzzle wasnt for you. Theres no shame in letting others who do like this sort of thing do the work and waiting for a walkthrough.  
---
But those who just wanted the reward just rode roughshod over those who wanted to actually do the event just because *they didnt want to wait* . It was a shitty thing to do. 
---
I'm considering moving, but I don't know where
---
There are several at Poseidon Energy Plant.
---
-In the protest camp across the street there is a caps stash under neath a small table in one of the tents. If facing the power plant, all the way to the right there are 2 tents with mattresses and couches. The stash is in the tent closer to the river. There is an alarm clock on the table, and a hot plate on the table right outside the tent.
---
-Also in the protest camp, there is a tree near the bridge across the river. There are barrels surrounding the tree. Caps stash is on a barrel. This stash may be on the ground nearby due to explosions or being knocked off
---
-Go to the PP parking lot across the street and head towards the plant yard workstation but do not go all the way yet. Standing on the helipad and facing the power plant you should see some metal crates stacked on the wall in front of you at about 10-11 o‚Äôclock position. It is actually the corner of the wall where it turns and moves farther from the player. On the metal crate is a stash.
---
-go to the workshop and instead of turning right to the bench turn left to the cooling towers. Head towards the tower directly in front of you and then head up the ramps to your left before you enter the tower and head to the roof of the plant. (As you climb there is a little office, on top of the file cabinet is a magazine spawn). Before you go to the highest level of the ramps there is a small section of roof to the left of the ramps you can walk on to. There are large pipes coming from the highest level and coming on to this section. Behind the farthest pipe is a stash.
---
-head to the next level and there is a rectangular turbine or air conditioner unit thing right in front of you (11 o‚Äôclock) right on top (waist height) is a stash
---
-now go into the cooling tower (left if jumping from roof) and head up the ramp to the left at the top of the first ramp there is a desk in front of you with a stash on top.
---
-on top of the safe in the control room at the top of this cooling tower room
---
The last two are inaccesible if the power plant has been restored due to the steam in the tower which harms the player. I have not had all of these spawn at once since they changed how stashes work, but I used to reliably get 5-6 every server hop before the change.
---
I'm on ps4 and I've yet to have any major issues after the update. I also didn't crash or disconnect at all that much pre patch. I crashed once over around a 24 combined hour period last week (pre patch). 
---
No issues beyond the typical frame drops here and there which have always been present since launch.
---
Oh logging in now!
---
PC?
---
Drivers up to date?
---
You run the game in Borderless Window mode? -&gt; Set it to Fullscreen.
---
HDD or SSD?
---
Tattoo speak easy... Is this a new location since the update? If not can't believe I haven't ruin into it.
---
Also where do we start for the "normal" challenge?
---
Very true,  or at least the tattered dress + eye of ra over your armor 
---
You can put a windmill on a roof without any glitch now though. I accidentally stumbled into that yesterday.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs rubbish it had the highest ballistic damage resistance in the game,x01 has the highest radiation and energy resistance in the game 
---
Thank you for the information üëçüèª
---
If you're constantly crashing, I'd recommend seeing if you're using the Targeting mod for your power armor helmet (if you use power armor). I haven't used it for a good 2 months now and yet to here of any news regarding that bug being fixed. That bug also caused my friends to crash (and probably players nearby too).
---
Yes there's an unmarked greenhouse in the Southeastern part of the Ash Heap and they have mutfruit growing in planter boxes set on a table, so it should really be possible.
---
Founder's Dirty Bastard is a Scotch ale, not an IPA, but it is very good.  
---
Bell's Two Hearted and Founder's All Day IPA are great basic IPAs from MI.
---
I'll have to try that again then.  I couldn't get it to place day before yesterday with the firepit. I'll have to try it again without the pit. Thanks for the info!

The problem is that I went to blackwater mine to read the terminal to see if it would update the quest or make it pop up, but nothing happened. It just seems as if the quest just disappeared on me. 
---
Me too, had to go coz my camp couldn‚Äôt get placed on that server, so hopping now 
---
Couple more:
---
* Stealth is broken again. Switched to a Melee weapon earlier and ever since I did that, the Stealth indicator is behaving erratic again. Caution / Danger with no enemies around. Stuck in constant Danger mode. Fast travelling still possible. Tested on several servers. Does not happen on all, which is odd and probably means that it's related to the state of your health as I noticed this behaviour a lot more while below 10% health. 
---
* Speed Demon is broken again. Most likely related to the Adrenal Reaction fix. 
---
* Cleared areas don't respawn. This happens everywhere, not only Whitespring. West-Tek, Generals Steakhouse, Harpers Ferry, the Estates in the Ash Heap. The whole map is affected.
---
* Also, while I'm at the topic of mentioning West-Tek, the machine gun turrets in the shopping carts would spawn in at least 4 different locations before patch 7. Now it's always the same placement, the one to the right of the main entrance. All others are no longer used. Tested with a couple of servers.
---
* Hornwright Estate. From certain angles you can look into the void. Most noticable when you look down from the room next to the one with the workbenches. Plus, the elevator doesn't lead to the actual elecator when you use it, instead you spawn in the room with the bot pods. This occurs since at least patch 4.
---
In regards to the vendors, you know that there are seven different factions. The cap pool of 200 is per each faction. This means you can trade up to 1400 caps in a 24 hour period. See the map here https://m.imgur.com/a/bpM5w1N for the vendor locations colored by faction. There is also a wandering super mutant vendor named Grahm who I believe his cap pool is separate though he is not as easy to find.
---
too much woke shock value and cheesy jump scares, needs more game. Puns &amp; Guns have always been the core of fallout.
---
They have a Creation Kit for 76? I may have to try and new PC to play on if they do. LOL I made so many mods for Morrowind through Oblivion, it was almost ridiculous. Then my PC blew up and I started playing Skyrim and Fallout 3 on console. 
---
Truth is, we are the npcs. Everyone is dead except us and mutants/robots/scorched.
---
When factions will come with guilds etc it'll hopefully become more interesting on this point. 
---
Thank ya!
---
There are factions in the game with whole series of quests for each of them. As for Karma, off the top of my head the closest we get to old fashioned karma in game is completing the Mayor for a Day quest in Watoga. After that all of the robots ignore you and recognise you as a citizen instead of attacking on sight. 
---
End of the day both of these things pretty much require human NPCs to make work, however I kind of hope 76 never introduces them to the game. 7y is unique by presenting us with a mostly, truly, lonely post-apocalypse and that's something we've never experienced before in any of the games.
---
Would love to get my ult his shots an immunizations! Will be on shorty Lawton Arnold 
---
Delete mods
---
I agree, nice to join Reddit and find fellow "lovers"  of the game instead of haters, Bethesda accomplished what they promised all be it with glitches but what games doesn't have glitches.
---
Will try and stay here for the next couple hours, or until someone is willing to take over.
---
I would still try to play it even if no questmarkers show up. Go to the next location
---
Nice one dude! Will be launching again in 4-5 hours time 
---
Ok ur post motivated me to give FO76 another try
---
You're welcome brah. Once you get with me, i have 2 people who I play with all the time that are much higher level than I am, and they have given me more stuff that they have outgrown than you can imagine. In fact, i have some armor pieces that may help you. I could sell them, but that wouldn't be right, ya know. Pay it forward and all that rot, ya know. ;o)
---
Lay off the Nukashine man
---
Nope. I'd count that as "high level privilege" too since i've mainly ran across multiple traders, including those in locations from the same fraction appearently.
---
But in all seriousness, does it make sense to you that they all share theyr budget? They're supposed to sell you stuff too and not only buy from you, are they not?
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox dude. Sorry I forgot to put the platform! 
---
Good to know! I wish there was something marking them saying ‚Äúknown plan‚Äù or something so we could get rid of the mod boxes 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. I will be putting a post up on 4-5 hours time.. keep your eye out as servers get full pretty quick!
---
I'd love to see more building pieces, especially interior walls and more roofing options, but a travel mat is really necessary. The last base I built would murder me every time I went home because the spawn point was under a rock.
---
As has been said in many duplicate posts, don't use unofficial mods
---
Been there done that from both sides. That's like the universal language for "just shoot me". LOL;o)
---
Grab hemlock holes when you login. 60 acid per H, stupidly easy defenses (worst one yet was lvl15 radscorps. ahhh oh noes. not 2 rounds each!) im sitting on well over 1k acid now. Often a grafton monster as well (more acid)  
---
Head SE of morgantown proper. Look for the green house with a broken roof. Most call it "Cat house" (youll see why when you get there) \~80 plastic. But the plastic king is 100% watoga HS. Ive pulled over 150 from a single run through.   
---
For iron ore (steel scrap) hit Hornwright test site #3 (right next to vault 63) theres a cluster next to the spawn point (on the rocks just above where you spawn in) and a second cluster up the hill from there (head up hill and listen for the super mutants that are pretty much always there)
---
That‚Äôs true, I never thought about it like that but your definitely right. It is more true to how things could have went but, I can recall playing new Vegas and finding all of those secret factions hidden in the wasteland 
---
Of course.  :/
---
Also an interesting thing in Chernobal is what dead leaves have a slower decay rate than normal. So in the games it is plausible that an exaggerated effect of that is happening to all the bodies, especially since the folks who died on the days of the bombs are all skeletons and all who died after mostly have bodies left. 
---
 base attacks - fuck is a level 20 supposed to do against a level 58 scorchbeast randomly attacking the base?? 
---
Either not build there or invest in the home defense perks,you do know that perks can be switched out right?
---
 why does moving your camp cost caps? - who even gets them? 
---
Caps sink  
---
 those prices - allmost 50 caps for a water but you're buying my 100 caps stimpack for 3 caps?... is this supposed to be a endgame privilege by design? 
---
supposedly,it make it harder to hit cap limit which is 25,000 and thee vendors form my understanding are on a 22 hour or 24 timer from the first time you interact with them. 
---
The one in Morgantown?
---
Get the plan - craft it - scrap it - repeat. 
---
It‚Äôs a weird system to learn mods but there you have it. 
---
I'm not sure how much you play, but if that's the best gun you can find then you need to stay flexible until you get a gun that drops that's worth building your weapon around. You need 1 gun to start a build. You need 5 armor pieces to finish a build. It would make sense that you get armor more often since that requires the most input.
---
Thank you will do
---
So the only way to change your user name is to delete your account. Repurchase fallout 76 for $80 bucks, which it's not worth in the first place, and make a new account.
---
All because Bethesda decided to use user id's to display to the world, instead of actual character names. It should have been stated when making an account that this is the name you will be broadcasting to the world. People would probably choose a name more carefully, since only at Bethesda, you can never change it. 
---
So totally frustrated...feeling ripped off because of the technical state of game anyway. Having to wait months for them to fix it, now I can't play because Bethesda won't change my user name. At a loss anymore with Bethesda. 
---
I get probably two or three invites for every gaming session and I deny them all. I haven't finished the main quest yet and I want to play it out to the finish. After that I might just team up with somebody. But until then I'm gonna be the Lone Wanderer exploring Waste Virginia.
---
It happened to oxhorn. He just deleted his mods and it worked great 
---
but be aware that after you finish the quest you get "Powerarmor frame" as a quest reward.
---
Don't accidentally scrap it! That's your ultracite armor!
---
(seen many people confuse it for an empty chassis; Thx Bethesda)
---
If you are on PC I can paint it for you. Same with anyone else having issues. 
---
Nope. I actually just dumped a crap load of them last night at Charleston Station. Gonna be rebuilt my C.A.M.P. today then dumping my non-rare junk there too. I wanna clean out my stash to start hoarding again lol.
---
It can be pretty heavy on screws. So get ready to say goodbye to them. The best mods can take quite a few rolls to get. 
---
You can also try to find a friendly vault dweller that already has the mods and can mod it for you. But there is no good system for that yet. 
---
Yea i deleted the custom file and it started working, i even kept my map mod.
---
Islamophobic shill respect my culture or go play Ubisoft whom let me remind you not only bans English players, but  comes from a country that outright bars English entertainment media from competing such as the Netflix scandal.
---
There's one on top of the high school, one in the center near AMS (Probably the one you know about).
---
One on a roof across a bridge from the civic center. For that one, go from AMS to civic center, on the side there is some metal stairs, go up and go over the bridge to the left, PA will be next to crashed vertibird on roof.
---
And the last one is on the roof of the medical services building. I think a PA plan/mod spawns there too.
---
An additional bonus set can be found a little bit south at survey camp alpha(?), You visit there for the BOS quesline. It has a PA set, PA workbench to slap the pieces on, as well as a plan spawns on the toolbox next to it occasionally. There's also a magazine spawn on the table next to the tent directly behind you.
---
There's such a glaring vulnerability with sentinel and cavalier I don't think there needs to be much consideration for balancing. If you can effectively negate all the damage mitigation using a feature that's available for you at level 2, then it's not unbalanced. 
---
Too funny
---
You said you went to download then right to register the premade armor.
---
Hah...I'm not sure if you would say that if you saw the bumbling chaos that I brought to that nuke site.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Your welcome 
---
I'm a PA/ heavy guns build so I don't care about normal armor. I have a decent Gatling laser (10% more dmg aiming and the anti armor effect), and normal Gatling plasma aren't bad either (focused muzzle and rifled barrel). It's just annoying when the drop rate feels like 3 armor/2 melee weapons/1 projectile weapons.
---
I've found it easier to find fusion cores by finding the power armor dotted around the wastes.
---
Tbh I should start and ignore them, I've got 38 at the moment lol
---
Yep, hacking was definitely key--I had held off getting my third Hacking perk, and when I had tried before, turrets were a huge issue.  I definitely had fun, especially because I ran out of ammo with my armor piercing handmade, then my shotgun broke, and I was taking out Gutsys with an armor-piercing board I whipped up for fun.   Just a big idiot with a stick launching nukes.
---
Not going to disagree that is a pain to run around to the vendors. If you have have already found a vendor for each of the factions you can fast travel to them to sell each day. Obviously, myself and others would prefer to be able to sell to each vendor the cap limit each day though I wonder if they are afraid that people will be able to earn thousands per day and then caps are not has hard to come by anymore.
---
I have many other gripes about how they fix something's and break others. Not a lot of quality control and their patches. I could easily make my own post with it. Instead I posted on the Bethesda fallout 76 forum to I've it as feedback with the hopes they will make some of these changes.
---
Yeah it occurred to me what I should have done after the fact. But like I said I hadn't played in a while so I was still trying to get my bearings. 
---
Ultracite is rubbish? It is debateably the best power armor in the game.
---
You don't need to wait til level 50 to get the BoS Ultracite armor set rewards. You just won't be able to _use_ it until level 50 lol (it's level-locked)
---
Sometimes you'll even see it be added to the list while you're looking at it. Bunch of useless stuff then *pop* a legendary appears at the top.
---
You get an upvote because that looks like my  dog Angus! He looks vicious but he is such a lovey. He's my buddy. ;o)
---
If you don't count the soda vendor in whitesprings selling it, then it might be. 
---
I've definitely noticed that overall it's more stable, though I have crashed a couple times. First time I've crashed in almost a month though.
---
Leveling as a low level player is best done in the West. Wavy williards, camden park, welch, ohio river adventures, point pleasant, tyler county fairgrounds and all daily events in the west offer excellent amounts of lower level enemies to level up. Don't mess with the current system. Change your XP farming locations.
---
It doesn't take too long to get past level 50. If you go with your suggestion it'll hurt you when your a high level.
---
If a Scorch beast attacks your camp just server hop. Exit to the main menu and load another world it's just easier than fighting them.
---
Can you store/scape, when I scraped my house it said something about do you want to scrap structure and keep all the components.  I did that and I was able to rebuild it piece by piece.  
---
Two shot explosive upvote.
---
There was one time, i was hopping up a mountain to see this other players base, not to grief, just to see if i could get to it. The guy came up behind me at the highest point of the mountain, a real beast. Over 100-200 (im level 26 and was lower at the time) and he invited me to a team. I responded by silently jumping off the mountain to my death as i maintained eye contact with him
---
Some guy last night kept dropping teddy bears for me to pick up. I felt so awkward cuz I had nothing to give back
---
UPDATE: Can launch nukes again. Just fixed itself.

You can pick up a white one from an event. It has an amazingly low drop chance though. Still think that's the best chance

no my anger is that i disagree with the design of an order that is "strictly cloak and dagger" as that is fucking worthless and not what was needed in such a world.

Check you have updated your *Fallout76Custom.ini* file, you do NOT have to stop using mods, the advice below is wrong.
---
I let them auto decline most of the time, but I wish we could add text to them.  So you would know what they wanted to do?  There is still the chance the new team mate just wants to fast travel to your camp and destroy it. 
---
Thank you. What event?? 
---
I had the same problem, fixed it easily by logging off and back onto a new server 
---
I just don't see the point in speccing hard into a certain build until you really find a gun that sets your build. Right now you're probably a little heavy into STR and INT. If you find the right shotgun or melee weapon that totally dwarfs everything you found up to that point, no biggie. You'd have to pivot from a STR dependent tree into another weapon that's STR dependent. Maybe re-spec some points out of INT and into AGL or LCK and you're fine. Maybe a few wasted points, but no issue. Find a good rifle and now you probably have to re-spec out of STR into PER and out of INT and into LCK. I'd just stay flexible until something drops.
---
Before I had any drops that were worth keeping I had a rifle build. Then I found a good shotgun and spent 30 levels re-speccing everything.
---
That would have saved me do much hassle, I had to create a second foundation further down the slope with a stairs going up and attaching the floor to that. Took a bit of effort to make it work. 
---
This. So much this
---
I believe so, remember having an issue similar to that and after one of the patches it was normal again
---
Looks like you are going to test it for us!
---
Because it's fun? Haha and because if I'm gonna have to burn a metric ton of ammo before I find a good gun, I might as well go for the resource effective ones. 
---
Yes actually gt same as name
---
Now take a deep breath.
---
Haha cool story bro.
---
I never die in PvP and this is why I think it's boring.
---
You on the other hand, obviously need a one sided mechanic PvP to get some kills.
---
Best of luck to you
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed chasing down and completing the game challenges for atom points! They often lead me to exploring new areas as well. I‚Äôve always been a completion-ist with games so maybe it‚Äôs just me but I also like saving up Atom points to  spend on CAMP items to build myself a cosy home.
---
I kinda like this idea
---
I feel this
---
Yup, it worked... I'm not moving my CAMP bench üòÖ
---
I need me some caps so I‚Äôd be happy to help- Lady Rot Roh is my GT on Xbox 
---
I agree. I can't seem to build a radio that plays West Virginia Radio, either, as I had in Fallout 4. There were some really good songs on that one. The radio I can build on 76 seems to mainly have the free access music which was on Diamond City Radio in Fallout 4. To be honest, I thought the music would be better on FO76. I feel a bit misled.
---
Some Johnny Cash &amp; Patsy Cline would be a good addition. Some 1960s country rock &amp; folk would be nice and not too out of the genre.
---
The other dome has the alien blaster e-cell conversion mod plans, and a small handful of AB ammunition.
---
For all I have done so far. Yes
---
Honestly I've yet to run into anyone who wanted to kill or fight me, or ruin my camp. Every player is super nice.
---
Yea, I've been doing Hemlock Holes. Been trying to find a better way. I'd really like to not have to deal with workshops completely.
---
For steel, I've been doing Abandoned Mine Shaft #5. There's a dump truck construction vehicle a few meters in front of you near a cliff, you go down the cliff and there's a set of stairs, about halfway down that cliff and to the right of those stairs are 4 iron deposits all very close to eachother.
---
Just checkout your suggested steel spawn. You indeed immediately spawn next to those deposits, but for someone reason I'm only able to loot one of the 3 nodes, and those 2 still clearly have iron on them. I didn't initially see the other 6 nodes directly above those 3 ones. Also saw 2 other nodes once you go on top of that little cliff, go forward about 10 ft, and then take a left and go for another 10ft. So excluding the 2 bugged ones, it's a total of 9 iron ore deposits. Really nice find. Thank you.
---
Yeah I'm no PA user and had almost 200 springs, now I'm down to zero and still got no longer barrel :D prepare for salty tears when you look at your former screw stash or if you scrap a rifle and get nothing for it.. 
---
They're already using that money to try to make up for the price plunge for the game. 
---
It is unique in the fact you can find it within the wastes when normally you can't but not because you can buy all the different varieties at a vendor in whitesprings 
---
What the actual fuck. PvP is only when you can die. If you never died in PvP then you are either lying or not doing actual PvP or simply griefing. I am so much in favour of slap damage that I practically ceased playing and am planning to return once survival servers are out, because I consider current one-sided situation ridiculous. If I do PvP, it means I found an obvious trap and went right into it. I also add people I fight with to friends so I could find them in the future and go into their traps again.
---
You are living in the realm of bullshit and your opinions lack any relevance nor connection with reality. Git gud.

Upvote because personalisation is key to RPGs.

Agreed, now just fix the crashes and YEET

Any Responder event in the Forest has a chance, but there's two that have a higher chance. Feed the People and Project Green Bean I think it's called
---
I'm awaiting Bethesda to release stats to prove you wrong. I bet I put you to shame
---
Where are the promised private servers? Had this quest to call in air drop just to have someone way higher than me steal it. Of course I can not retaliate against them since they much stronger. In another case I was minding my own exploring and suddenly I got wanted status for 10 caps? What the heck? I do not attack other players, ever. There was not another player base near-by so I could not have accidentally stolen from someone.  So of course some high level comes and kill me.
---
So far I have been enjoying the game just trying to do the quest line, except for when I encounter other players who is just there to ruin it.
---
Cool thank you great help üëç
---
Yep.  This is exactly why they put the report function in the game.
---
What system? 
---
Have hated reload in video games since Wolf3D. the least realistic part of ever video game ever.   
---
\*loads 8 shells\*  
---
\*jumps mid chambering of first round\*  
---
ENTIRE RELOAD SEQUENCE CANCELLED.  
---
Like, TF, did my rounds fall out?
---
Takes 1/2 sec to reload AR.  
---
Have any of these developers ever reloaded an AR magazine? Its a goddamn process. and thats with a small mag. I get that having to reload every time you empty it would be a drag. but maybe somewhere in between instantly reloading drum magazines, and shotguns take an hour?
---
Can anyone explain how i can reload my 95 round handmade in 1/2 a second. But it takes 10x as long to pull out and fire my sidearm in like almost every game ever.
---
Riiiight! Thanks for the heads up! 
---
Why the hell haven't you played 3!!!!? Best one
---
My ign is imprezobus just as it is here. Won't be dodging the challenge. Whats yours?
---
Where'd you get them glasses man? Never seen em before, would look jokes on my raider dude
---
Guns are OK now, but last I checked (before current patch) melee hit detection is still bad, the stealth meter still gets jammed, enemies still spawn 10 feet in front of you, you still take random damage from walking and you can still get killed because your character hit stuck on a pebble and the stimpak button took 3 hits. Oh, and the intro still says you overslept. 
---
Maybe they've fixed everything, I haven't had time to find out. 
---
You got a big mouth, let me shut it up IGN alpahc
---
I jumped back in after about two months and I'm not gonna deny that the user experience has increase drastically.
---
Unfortunately, with not much new to do, I found myself getting bored again after a few hours. I can only grind legendaries and get absolute junk for so long.
---
Love the game, but looking for some more meat to hold my attention.
---
Berry Mentats highlight living things
---
I think they're called "Hip Glasses". They're in the Atomic Shop, I got them with the poodle skirt. They might be sold separately, though.
---
Ahh okay gotcha
---
ewwww
---
This happened to me twice, and now I always put my power armor on just before I exit the game...
---
Can you equip it?
---
Are you Xbox? I can add mods you want for free.
---
I run out screws a lot doing this took some time to get my lever action suppressed. Now working on Gauss rifle that cost a shit load. My lever action is maxed out but the gauss hit harder. Lever is lv 50 but gauss only lv 35. I can make lv 45 but the one I got has NV scope which I haven‚Äôt unlocked. 
---
I takes a lot of screws I need to make screw runs for about an hour to get over 100 and goes like butter.  
---
Hey, ya missed one. 
---
You can collect toxic goo from the vats at Westek and around the building. I‚Äôve drunk it but I‚Äôve got lead belly so no harm. I think it‚Äôs a lot of rads no poison effect 
---
Add me Stevieboy118 and I'll hook you up with a decent shooter later.
---
Stealth doesn't jam anymore. But now it takes forever for the detection to display ha.
---
Oddly enough I never see those twats Yong or juice again saying how nice the whole experience is .....
---
I have quad harpoon gun which does exactly that and I consider it to be The Gun. The one that surpasses all others. And I'm not even specced into heavy guns, my build became weapon-agnostic after I got that gun.
---
Poser.
---
there's even more up the hill. Head for the mountain kinda left of where you spawn (think its nw?)
---
I need to make a video, like nobody knows about the second cluster.
---
Quest is permanent, event is temporary,  these are two different things.
---
I put a fusion generator down at Poseidon when that area looks empty. Made about 12 last night and all being 100 is really nice in the stash
---
PC and all drivers are up to date.
---
 I think it is on fullscreen but I will double check.
---
HDD.
---
Just updated to Wild Appalachia I will see if this update brings any performance boosts!
---
Sounds like fun.
---
Though I will suggest something optional to make it potentially more challenging: Remove all combat + stealth perks.
---
such an inspired touch sticking then in the loading screens! 
---
I would say the anti armor assault rifle. Stack with a armor piercing clip + AA perks
---
They change the lore all the time. 
---
probably because you don't write well.

Lewis, the Creator of Nukashine was a Taste Tester at Nuka Cola as per a note found in the Facility.

I've been having issues with crashing while building my camp. Other than that it's been pretty smooth. 
---
Thank you man!
---
As if you're capable of writing anything worth reading.
---
you can sleep peaceful tonight. He has done what i would do if i got accidentally wanted
---
That's something at least. My first character was a stealth build. I gave up on stealth when I spent ages clearing a town of super mutants only for the whole town to respawn right in front of me before I'd even started looting. 
---
This is one of the best things to do in game - if you grow out of your gear it's so cool you can give it to people who'll benefit from it more than you. You not only made that guys day but also probably opened up a chance for a whole new playstyle for him
---
The "TNT Nuka Dome" that the OP is referring to is the NEW Nuka Cola Quantum PA Paint for the X-01 that was just introduced in this latest patch.... not the original T-51b paint.
---
When crouched look at the top. If it says caution or hidden. Then enemies if they hear or see something sometime they random shoot around. If it says danger then they spotted you  no matter if you are invisible. If you don‚Äôt want to shot more away until go back to caution. I have all the sneak perks and have Chameleon armor on it works. I have seen mutants walk right by me.
---
gosh what a colossal setback. you poor dear. 
---
They fixed the cell eating.
---
oh my goodness that framerate just cured my rad worm
---
I started with 76, then bought 4. Both pretty neat
---
I just came back from a long break to try the new stuff, and generally it feels pretty much exactly the same to me, except less crashing, and maybe more loading lag.  
---
It\`s playable as a survival game.   
---
And oh yes, being a server side stash, every single bit of bytes matter (and costs).
---
The late game god mode you get from past games wont be coming here.
---
This looks the professional golfers equivalent of power armor. 
---
I used to see this happen in the earlier months of the game, and it seemed to occur when I spawned into a server that had recently expired a nuke zone. That zone would be populated with eyebots and most of the flora and fauna was in its nuked variety though there was no other evidence of radiation. Interesting that this can still happen!
---
My stuff is working, but I noticed damage numbers changing. I was using strange in numbers, bloodied, and adrenal. 
---
Was this not specifically stated to be coming in one of the Wild Appalachia updates?
---
Happened to me, don‚Äôt rebuild because it will just happen again.... trust me
---
Yeahhh this crossed my mind. Maybe it has nothing to do with the new update and is just a bug.
---
SERIOUSLY. As someone who built their CAMP on a hill, every time I try to plot down crops, the corn doesn't touch the ground. It's frustrating, especially as we now have the opportunity to make better things out of crops. 
---
Another person wasting someone's time with the report function. 
---
I feel for the guy that has to read all of them. 
---
"Some guy kept killing me. He should be banned!"
---
Are you using energy weapons and have the grounded mutation?
---
Happened to me 2 days ago. Placed my power armour but it always lags at the golf course. I took 99% rads but didn't die. After 2 minutes my armour appeared so I jumped in. Still on 1% HP. Took a radaway and it killed me. Very strange.
---
Toxic valley workshop has a lot of acid ore. 3 in fact. A lot of people don‚Äôt take that workshop so I run over there to get a lot of acid. Most of toxic valley is acid ores

Oh believe me. First time I ever played New Vegas years and years ago, when I discovered the Enclave Remnants I loved it. Or finally getting into Nellis Air Base. 
---
I believe they've expanded the no-build zone around map markers- theres not necessarily anything new there (yet)
---
SSD is what this game needs to be on. Streaming the textures from a normal HD will make it chug.
---
Also, I'm confused. How exactly did you play this game without WA installed? It's always online and won't even start without the update...
---
mohawks yet?
---
That is a nice mashup.

[There's always at least 5 around VT Agricultural Research Centre, just down by the stream](https://imgur.com/a/pMtgd8a)

P.S. There's a dead chem lady nearby that same stream, pay 'er a visit.
---
maybe your computer just can't handle it? I can run it on ultra settings with little more than a disconnect every now and then, and it's been like that since the beta.
---
Sorry, I hadn't played in a while and wanted to get back into it after hearing about WA and thought I'd post here to see if I can get help if the issues persist. 
---
That's frustrating. I have had no issue with other games it's pretty annoying. Any advice to maybe make the issue a little less dramatic?
---
To provent players from circumventing the collection of caps ( by running very few caps),  a random (but worn) peice of armor or the weapon they are carrying gets awarded to the player who collects the bounty.
---
That's what I was thinking was a possibility too. However, I tried to place my camp closer to the wendigo cave, and after a certain point, it tells me that I can't because it is a marked location. It's a little strange to me that they would expand the radius of current poi's but the game still let's me place my camp on my original spot just to move it when I log back in. I'm also a decent distance away from the cave or other poi's. I doubt they would make the radius that big.
---
PS4.  
---
I did report it yes.  
---
I reported it.  I also felt the need to make a post about it.
---
I don't know if scaling changed but I came back after only playing for the first 3 weeks. I spawned at whitesprings where I left off but I was unable to leave due to enemy's twice my level (30 vs 60) outside the gate. Did the difficulty spike? 
---
Its a little harder to get up there without it but it is possible.

Not sure if taste-test has a chance too.
---
They only came with the skirt and are no longer available.
---
Yes... but the problem is that the ‚Äúworld‚Äù is awesome, but there isn‚Äôt much ‚Äúgame‚Äù in it. IF THE GAME HAD AS MUCH CONTENT AS THE WORLD, THIS WOULD BE A GOTY CONTENDER. 
---
But...
---
You say that you can ‚Äúbegin anew‚Äù here, but can you? Really? What changes can you bring about in the world? None, because the world doesn‚Äôt change. 
---
This is a cool world to explore, but none of it matters. The people you spent half of your life with are now randos who never build their homes next to you. You can‚Äôt settle down with (or even near) anyone. You can‚Äôt fix a bridge, or start a faction, or anything. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on xbox my gamertag is SpicySpicySaak
---
I agree... but.. I miss the dialogue this is a much lonelier game. 
---
I unofficially teamed up with a bounty hunter once. I saw a bounty at the penitentiary, fast traveled to the Grafton Dam and started sneaking over. through the woods I see a guy in power armor sneaking up from the Morgantown airport. 
---
The bounty is hiding out in the yard of the penitentiary, using the super mutants as guard dogs. A good trick, he must be stealthy. Without any communication with power armor guy, I sprint around the side of the jail, circle around to the hole in the perimeter wall. Then I start sneaking. Badly. The super mutants see me and start shooting. I'm creeping around the yard, checking the map, being horrible at stealth.
---
As I'm sprinting from one shadow to another I get shot at from behind. Whip around to see the the bounty, who was right behind me and shooting, go down.  Shot from behind, by power armor guy. We never shared a word, an emote or anything. Never even teamed up. But that was the best bounty hunt I ever had.

Will be on in about 5 hours

&gt;fallout 4
---
&gt;been playing for 4 years
---
What the fuck? I swear to God I bought the damn game on release like 3 months ago. 
---
They took it out?? That's unfortunate, it's a cool outfit.
---
Likewise came back recently, and the only real issues I had had are quests bugging out. Started a new character and had to drop server a number of times to fix the step I was on for early responders quests. No hard crashes or disconnecting has been nice. 
---
Also have done it on my own when i had no marsupial ^.^
---
In worst case get the jetpack pa also working well :)
---
They really should have pet and robot companions for solo players. Just make it so you can‚Äôt use them if you‚Äôre in a party 
---
I saw a post about a person who tamed a cat. 
---
I have another character that i stored all ledgendarys on. Right now I have so many that I reached the weight limit. Most are all 1 star though unfortunately. 
---
Yeah it was one of sale items that were getting removed from the atomic shop just before patch.

You can tame animals for your camp ü§î

If you assign it on the quick select, you can hover over it and check it's durability w/o going into the menu

If you get alot of spoiled meat or veggies you can make fertilizer. 
---
I bought the plan from a vendor in Camden Park. Was almost 5k caps. 
---
I had that same problem yesterday when my brother and I joined up yesterday. I tried fast traveling to my camp first and THEN it would let me fast travel to him. Was really weird. Not the first time I‚Äôd seen that bug, too. 
---
There's a billboard sorta near the nuclear power plant in the mountains (close to a farm) that spawns kitties. They chill on my porch all the time. 
---
I have this problem with scorchbeasts. I'm not sure if it's a hitbox issue or the server thinking they're in a different place as I've noticed little lag spikes making them jump around a lot.
---
Or full of caps
---
Isin't ultracite T-51 armor? 
---
If so, you could buy the plans from watoga shopping center?
---
He protec, he also attac, but most importantly he stay at your shack
---
I‚Äôm def noticing a lot more lag on PS4 running straight into Ethernet. But I figure it‚Äôll be ironed out in following patches... I hope, lol. 
---
They drop from the sbq, if you're on xbox I can make them for you for the materials. 
---
I used to have a new starter friendly camp located next to the bridge by the overseers camp, all the work benches ready for players to use and I would often drop some bags with weapons and ammo for players to use, had signs on the wall saying "take one".
---
Unfortunately too many people would take them all and leave nothing for the next players so I stopped that idea.
---
I have only been attacked once when I accidentally shot a lads turret. I was level ten he was 128
---
I enjoyed completing the quest but didn't like learning the antagonist's plan.
---
[Olivia thinks the raiders are garbage and that the order could accomplish a lot but her mother is holding them back. So she decides to get the order destroyed to join the trash group. Why not just work out a plan to get her mother out of the house, kill her and lead the order in a new direction. The whole quest is just built up to be sad but it just falls completely flat because the motives are just goofy and poorly done.](/spoiler)

It's worth checking TNT Dome 7 on your server before because it might be unlocked already. I think it happens if somebody else has gone through the process already.
---
Yup, and I don't think it's a glitch. Seems to happen after people have farmed the sh!t out of the Club house following a nuke zone, maybe a way for the server to tell us, 'enough is enough?' ;-)
---
Interestingly, when I encountered protectrons there, they were on treads, not on legs ‚Äì I've never seen that variant in the game, only in Fallout 4. On other occasions, the Golf Club was populated with eyebots, or liberators btw, both of which are good for dropping low level legendaries (like, level 1).
---
What is in TNT Dome 2? And how do you get the key? Is there a link to an article or video you can share?
---

I got disconnect issue while building, also some object shadow will stay even tho i removed it

For the first time in my life I wished I was colorblind, well played sir, take my upvote.

I got bored about FO76 a few months back when the duping glitches were rampant and my game constantly crashed. But, I kept up with this sub!   
---
I just picked up FO4, and when I finish the main story, I think I'll pick up 76 again :) Sounds like Bethesda is headed down the right path. 
---
umm we need your pet tax

The clown suit you can find in the Halloween store up at the northeast of the map, Freddy Fear's House of Scares. The mask can be found in the bank at the New Appalachian Central Trainyard (just north of Whitesprings)
---
Unfortunately, I have to agree.  The game for me is much more unstable after Patch 7 than it was after that downtime following Patch 6.  I've had a hard crash (i.e. blocked Task Manager from even appearing), the sound cutting out completely, and even a semi-reliable disconnect while I was constructing Power Armor and cooking (the minute I constructed it, twice, disconnect).  Even when it works, load times are easily 20-30% longer across the board.
---
How??????
---
Can't I install calibrated shocks on my excavator and get +200 carry weight?

Makes you hurt yourself in your confusion 
---
Not to concerned about the fertilizer, I wanted the brahmin that comes with it.
---
Fight back or block.  No sense in wasting someone's time because you can't handle someone on the internet shooting digital rounds into you. 
---
I had a duper slowly walk like a mile into my camp when I was lvl 5 and gave me 1000 lead gunpowder and steel, gave me a thumbs up and wandered away. Used that ammo for a log long time.
---
Amazing, only need mask!! Thanks so much!!
---
I‚Äôve been doing that too. I also drop plans and recipes I already know outside 76 when I see new players. It really does keep things interesting. That‚Äôs the fun of these games, being forced to think out of the box. I‚Äôm looking forward to player vending and setting up shop‚Äî-ps4- festista

Which was great if you wanted a completely bald hairstyle (since the barber shop only goes down to buzz cut), but not so great if you liked your current hairstyle or had one of the limited time hairstyles you can't get outside events (Mullet and Flapper Bob. Eventually they were made permanent)

Don't forget interior brick walls!

You can't buy Ultracite PA mods from Chad, the Camden Park vendor. Those are Excavator Mods. The Ultracite PA mod plans only drop from the SBQ. And you can't buy mods either.
---
i got it a few hours after the latest patch, you're probably just unlucky
---
Pretty much the same but no stash in case anyone is trying to murder me, so that I may win the war of attrition. Two story house, first floor is free reign and the second + roof is my private spot. ;)

Bethesd should delete the game

I usually accept invites because half the time people just want a free fast travel across the map. I purposely camp out in the middle of nowhere, I like the views. They spawn on me, thumbs up and quit the team.
---
You can only get Ultracite PA mods from the SBQ, on her body after she is killed. I know the plans for all PA parts and mods and can do Ultracite PA Calibrated Shocks for 1000 caps each or 500 caps + 5 violet Flux each. IGN: jchamlin
---
The damn correctional facility with the mutants. I started it as the event quest was also starting where you have to fix the turrets, but luckily another dude was there for it at that time. By the time I went in and cleared two of the cell blocks, I was half out of stimpacks, nearly empty on ammo, and carrying way too much good scrap so I left.
---
Fallout 76 was the perfect game to have a dog companion like Dogmeat considering their artistic decision of not including human NPCs would still allow us to have Dogmeat. I really hope Dogmeat was in the game and it feels like such a missed opportunity to leave out one of the most iconic things in Fallout.
---
so if we ignore the min/max and other useless perks... i would still take 200lvls?
---
Where is this vendor?  The train station?

Its so much fun, Ive made it part of my character. (giving out free stuff)

Probs why MrMeeSeeks has become my online moniker. I derive a stupid amount of joy from helping people then disappearing forever, without a trace.

My favorite is when i can sneak up on a low level in the overseers camp. I'll pop out of a bush with a sudden "do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, lamp? Here, have some literature" then proceed to drop dozens of pounds of plans and recipes on em.

Only had a couple people not run off the server screaming, but the ones that do stick around are usually pretty stoked.

I get a few invites here and there every time I play. Unfortunately, I like to engage players when I come across them in the game. I roleplay a bit, but problem is that most of the time the players I run into don't have mics. Emotes are fine, but it would be more immersive to be able to engage in conversation. 
---
My buddy got one right across the river from deathclaw island.
---
From the patch notes: 
---
**C.A.M.P. Placement Adjustments:** Occasionally, when we bring new content to the game, it may need to be placed somewhere that was previously usable as a C.A.M.P. location. We can't have C.A.M.P.s and quests occupying the same space and while we do our best to limit these cases, sometimes it‚Äôs unavoidable.
---
* Starting with Patch 7, and in future updates, we plan to add a few new ‚Äúno-build zones‚Äù to the game world that will prevent players from constructing C.A.M.P.s in those areas.
---
* However, it‚Äôs possible some players may have already built in these locations before they became no-build zones. When this happens, affected players will be notified upon joining a world that their C.A.M.P.s can no longer be placed, and they will be given a free C.A.M.P. placement as a result. We don‚Äôt expect this will impact most players, but we hope this free move will help you find a new home for your home.
---
You don't use PA? How tanky  are you with that build? I wanted to do something similar but was unsure how fragile it would be.

---
I like 3 and all, but is it really wise to tell someone to go back and play 3 if they started with NV?
---
I know the feeling. Craziest time was clearing a lone building of supers. I take ten steps out, and turn around to see a deathclaw and a bear going at it with two robobrains spectating. If I had been any slower I'd be mystery meat.
---
Just wait, Bethesda will replace him with a radstag. RIP Jimmy.

I use T-51b with no mods, seems fine.
---
mobs i have to deal with always go for my crops and nothing else, they ignore the turrets, fences, walls and whatnot. They only focus on my ~~cabbages~~ crops
---
Animal Friend or Wasteland Whisperer. It let's you pacify and sometimes tame certain animals. 
---
Performance is still pretty sucky. Guess it is a no go. It must be either my HDD as you've said or my internet.
---
Im just trying the get the Starched genes perk card but I keep getting Concentrated fire.
---
Right, I saw that. The point of my post is that I can still build in this supposed new "no build zone." Lack of change in the area also makes me question why my camp was moved, especially seeing as it is in kind of an obscure location surrounded by at least 3 other poi that I can see on my hud. Was just trying to raise some discussion as to what that space could be reserved for, and touching on the possibility that it might be bugged and telling people they are in a bad place incorrectly, or maybe because they are built above one of the underground locations. Especially since they made the comment "we don't expect this will affect most players," yet I'm seeing quite a few reports of people having to relocate. Just food for thought if anything.
---
I‚Äôd be okay with that tbh; I think a glowing radatag would be sweet to have walking around. But yeah I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised 
---
i was multitasking, barely paid attention to my surroundings when i got it!
---
got it using this guide though, hopefully that's helpful enough https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xhde2/tnt_dome_keys_spoiler/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
1. There are 7 vendors, so you can gain 1400 a day(they reset 20 hours). Once you've played for a bit you can ft to the vendors and make your caps quickly. It'd make a lot more sense if they made it so one vendor would only buy one type of item, like a raw food buying vendor, a cooked food buying vendor, chem buying vendor, weapons vendor, etc. 
---
2. It's been mentioned before and most agree, it'll help be mitigated when they release player vendoring in 3 weeks. 
---
3. It's a convenience fee, like fast travel.
---
4. Hard Bargain 3 is pretty useful. It'll bring your stimpack selling price up to 8-11 depending on Charisma. Just grab water from someones camp. Most people won't care if you take it from them. Or just drink boiled water. 
---
5. If you PVP, you're going to want to have a full crit bar so you can crit players with melee sentinel. Melee one shots everything if you spec for it, if you don't then you only one shot everything except SB and MQ(with a decent weapon).
---
6. Idk about that, my camp is by a river so I either collect to boil, or I use purified to drink. 
---
7. People have complained about the rads from collecting water with lead belly/aquaboy. 
---
8. Each area has max levels so if you don't want to see high level mobs, you can stay in those areas safely. So if you're in the forest you won't see a level 10 mob, in the toxic valley you won't see a level 26 mob, etc. Take your time exploring the map and you'll be higher than the max level creatures in the area. 
---
9. See point 8.
---
10. See point 8.
---
11. Set your base in the forest, ash heap, or Toxic Valley if you don't want to see a scorchbeast attacking your camp. 
---
I did the jump just fine without the mutation and in power armor so I don‚Äôt have to worry about dying like that. Also no jet pack. 
---
Awesome!
---
Actually last night I went over there checking to see if I could get my bf the plan and the doors were open but they didn‚Äôt even take the plan. So you never know. 
---
Dome 2 has the Alien Ammo. Dome 3 has T-51 Nuka Cola plans. Dome 7 has X-01 Quantum power Armor plans. 
---
I would agree that "you get what you put into it" is a very appropriate adage for Fallout 76, and perhaps one reason why the game fell flat on its face at launch.  The modern gamer doesn't expect that anymore - the need to inject their own creativity into the game.  They expect to be spoon-fed an elaborate story that positions them as the lone savior of a troubled world and asked to make choices whose consequences are predetermined.  They want canon that tells them everything in excruciating detail, so nothing is ambiguous.  They basically want everything on a silver platter with minimal effort.
---
But don't tell them that, because they'll complain that you're holding their hand.
---
Only level 27 but I already have a ton of gear so I tend to leave 38 ammo at the overseers camp along with some purified water or medical supplies, to help out new comers.  That said had plenty run from me thinking I‚Äôm trying to grief them also so it doesn‚Äôt always help out. 
---
God no. That would have been so wrong on so many levels from a gameplay design point.
---
I hate how you have to spin the revolver every time you take it out. It's also funny if you it isn't fully loaded and you take it out and spin it but somehow it always fires lol
---
Now there's a good boy. I need to put him somewhere warm...like my grill. Slather on some bourbon sauce and get in muh belly. Mutt chops, ribs doggy style, the possibilities are endless. üòã
---
I did that..Started with NV then played 4. Checked out 3 and i loved it. Explored every inch of the map and did multiple playthroughs
---
I have the keys,i can help anyone opening the door add me on PC: darknessdragon6
---
It is in one of the bank safes, the safe-door is only slightly ajar, so look carefully in each one. 
---
Definitely. For the most part it's unnoticable, however you do notice regional servers primarily when you complete an event.
---
If you're on your specific region this takes up to 1 second max on non Scorched Earth. On Scorched Earth it might be longer but will still be relatively quick. Join another server region however and you might notice anywhere from 5-30 second delays on events, and Scorched Earth can delay several minutes. 
---
the sad truth is, mobs agro whatever "loads" for them first. it just happened to be the scarecrow but could be anything else.
---
I'm only level 20 and he was level 100. Like I said I hadn't played in a while. It didn't occur to me until after the fact that I should have just blocked him to begin with.       
---
Also attacking me and throwing grenades at me when I try to leave. And then destroying my camp because I'm trying to ignore him. That's a dick thing to do. 
---
Unfortunately for me, I am a very slow stealthy type.
---
Since then my characters have been foregoing stealth in favour of lunatic circle strafing, charging and fleeing while chanting the magic words "I'm hitting the bloody stimpak button, you stupid game!"
---
I'm having more fun.
---
Found tha fan boi, lulz
---
Selling ammo wouldn't be easy to implement given the low caps the venders have. Right now the lowest amount you can see stuff for is 1 cap so you could just sell ammo which is easy to get and get max caps really easy. Unless they let us bulk ammo to sell for lower values then 1 cap per round I dont see them letting us sell them any time soon. I would enjoy if they let us scrap ammo for lead gun powder and steel tho so we could turn unused ammo into ammo we do use 
---
You can mix unyielding and chameleon pieces with good results, keep your health at 20% buy any bloodied weapon (one star is ok) and Appalachia is yours.
---
I love this too! I'm a photographer in real life so enjoy taking 'nice' landscapes of the places I've visited and seeing my travels in load screens is so much better than the same old screens over and over.
---
It would be nice if you could set an option and it gives alittle icon next to your name.

Like do not disturb or uninterested in party. Also add in one for interested in party.

Hi. I have noticed since the latest patch I am unable to craft and place items in my camp. I keep getting the error message no item selected. Any suggestions on how to get around this? I am on PS4 gamer tag S77V12. 
---
No skin off my back, but I doubt it.
---
You‚Äôre no raider. Don‚Äôt call yourself one. GTFO precious. 
---
You are a legend!
---
I'm on Xbox and from the UK so should be able to make it, I'll add you on xbox if that's OK. 
---
Then yes whether you agree or not, you and Olivia felt the same. FWIW, you shouldn‚Äôt side with enclave as well. Lolz
---
not true. stealth still gets jammed out of nowhere. and stealth doesn't work at all in "multi-faction" fights since patch 6.
---
I feel like this is why people who actually do something ban worthy will not get in any trouble because of all the stupid reports people send in. 
---
I just dropped a bloodied auto grenade launcher. What was weird about it is that it has no prefix. Dunno why I dropped it. Sleep deprivation. 
---
There is no way that the Brahmin pen takes up more budget than three turrets - so you have other issues with your CAMP.
---
What outfit are you wearing on your chracter?
---
also
---
&gt;activate Windows
---
Would be good for OLED tvs too.
---
The pa animation bug will never go away, been there since fo4. Kind of got used to it.
---
Not tried one for pvp but my commando can put down a scorchbeast in about 2 seconds with a radium. Fairly sure scorchbeasts have more hp/dr than players.
---
I kept dogmeat from fo4 in his doghouse. I wouldn‚Äôt take him w/me on quests. He looked so real and trusting. Broke my heart when he‚Äôd get hurt. Lolz
---
Sure bro Gt: Kingsmokeyyy
---
I agree it needs a fix and I use a full set of sent/assassin gear. Rad damage, staggering,  and anti armor weapons work on the armor tho. 
---
It needs a prefix tbh. I just check every one I pick up to see if it's worthwhile or not. 
---
Speed demon has been borked since the adrenal reaction borking. It procs when it feels like it, but since it isn't as spoken about as adrenal it'll take longer to get fixed.
---
Any one else not having paired card 2 showing up in the right place
---
Will do!
---
You have a Fallout76Custom.ini set.  You nerd to fix it.  Either remove it or check the post here for what the default setting should be:

If you play on pc and have mods I heard you have to uninstall them because of the new patch and update them or something sorry I cant help more I'm a console player
---
doesn't answer my question lol
---
You can always test it out yourself for confirmation. I know I removed three of my turrets and a water purifier and I was still getting the "Exceeded Budget" notice if I attempted to create the fertilizer producer.
---
The thing is all of us highlevs are bored as hell since there is nothing to do in the game. Nothing better to fill game time than helping lowbies :)
---
Found him opposite the overseer's camp.
---
I agree.  It would be stupid for the game that has such a veriaty in gear to bottle neck people into using something they otherwise wouldn't because of one armor effect.  Unless they add different ways to counter the armor I think a few tweaks would be good. Just nothing to drastic 
---
yup ever since the last update I have not gotten one daily. I actually like doing some of them too. 
---
same here, its been broken since the patch
---
Dog steak time 
---
I wish there were more plot lines like this in the game.  With just a few holotapes, notes and terminal entries at various locations, you have some compelling storytelling.
---
Buttery smooth. Didn‚Äôt know I had FPS problems until now. 
---
It was very good. I am not a hoppy/IPA person, but I find that Black IPAs are more palatable. In reality I would have not ordered it save for the Fallout connection, but in the end I was happy I did.
---
"Sentinel and Cavalier simply shouldn't be allowed to stack."

These armor are easily countered.  Figure it out. PvP a while and invest in a counter.

I was playing from release, when we used to farm white springs, having to adhere to normal weight limits woudl mean stopping after like 10 minutes of getting loot, yay, great design.

If you‚Äôve unlocked brewing you‚Äôve been there. If not, have a look around VTU in Morgantown. 
---
This happen in the prison to a buddy of mine a few times. Even the hospital bed wrapped around him at one point. Could not control myself haha.
---
Beauty of this game is open world, don't ruin it for yourself by setting artificial barriers. Go wherever you feel is comfortable for you.
---
For example when i made my fourth character I gave it fully modded lvl 15 raider pa couple mutation serums and handmade. Now after hitting lvl 15 he can go anywhere on the map.
---
I am actually pretty unhappy today, so I appreciate you asking, thank you for that.
---
I had a lot of fun playing FO76 before and today spent ages messing around with it and still am overweight, so pretty frustrated, plus my entire friends list has zero people online.
---
Like everyone quit, literally everyone.
---
Fallout 4 crashes every 20 minutes or so for no reason, tried all the fixes, given up on that one, so not being able to play FO76 without having to delete most of the hard earned weps is super frustrating.
---
I have one dude 
---
:&lt;
---
‚ÄúPlay some Skin-nard!‚Äù
---
same for free en pc
---
Is that fair though? What if you bought a duped item for a ton of caps not knowing it was duped? What if you got it geniunely. 
---
For instance I have a three star two shot explosive gatling plasma. It has identical traits to a commonly duped one, I got it from my friend who said they got it from a loot drop. It could be duped, I can't confirm but chances are its not. Is it really fair to take away items from innocent people? 
---
Amazing three stars are super rare to get, and way more common than they should be because of dupers. But in my 200 of so hours of playing I've gotten 2 geniunely good three star rolls. Those items might overlap with a commonly duped item. 
---
There isn't really a good way to deal with duped legendaries, without punishing honest players as collateral damage. 
---
This is happening. New camp evacuation protocol. 
---
Where can i get calibrated shocks?
---
Best way to deal with bloody weapon users? Gamma gun. Enjoy those rads. 
---
Ahh, okay. Thanks.
---
Not a reportable offense! Not harassment!
---
Its part of the game you are playing. Its by design...
---
Ya lmao I keep a deepdish weightless gamma on me all the time just in case
---
I'm on Xbox and can paint it for you.
---
how much for the cryolator?
---
Mind if I add your GT for future events? Won‚Äôt be able to make it tonight, but it‚Äôd be great to be in touch with a few more active UK players. 
---
My first out-of-the-vault group of reigns have all quit, and my other half and I haven‚Äôt had much luck taking on the SBQ without 10+ level 30s showing up and making it impossible. 
---
Haven‚Äôt seen her die for weeks. 
---
It‚Äôs a sign your getting banned soonüòÄ
---
I was surprised to see that when you add the fertilizer resource to your camp, it comes with a brahmin. 
---
Yes it would. The dog could literally do zero damage but just having someone to travel with would be great.
---
Sure dude! Jump in with us one day and you‚Äôll no doubt see her die multiple times haha! 
---
r/UnexpectedTrebuchets
---
I must find this!! That‚Äôs the forest area right?
---
Did a friend build you something in your CAMP that you don't have the plan for? 
---
I'm also a heavy gunner, I've found great success in the uranium fever event. The legendaries there are normally level 40. I don't know if they have a higher chance for heavy weapons or not, but of my 4 good heavy weapon legendaries, I found 3 of them there. 
---
The nuclear waste comes in handy when repairing gatling plasmas as well. 
---
There are just a bunch of tanky enemies out there, and bullet penetration is low with their armor. I'd suggest trying to get lots of lead, steel, and gunpowder so you can craft the .44 rounds you need. I'm working on a rifleman build and am having a similar situation. 
---
For damage I would recommend going full Pirate build. Grab as many black powder pistols as you can and rotate between them. That way you cut out reloading times during combat as you switch from one to another fairly quickly.
---
You can buy the plans to build them from Whitesprings. It's a shame revolvers don't feel like they have as much of a kick they do in Fallout 4. 
---
It was in the title...
---
Fair enough 
---
Farm flux and craft them. The charge is effected by int and produces overcharged cores. Not sure of the maths but 12 int makes 120% charge. Plus super duper might give you extra.
---
Hank god damn Thompson. Add Shenandoah Waltz
---
unfortunately not yet
---
Maybe aggressively farming loot isn‚Äôt the best way to enjoy this game. Maybe you want a more look centric shooter.
---
Upgraded to a new HandMade Rifle and now getting procs.  Not sure what the variable is that could cause this.
---
I love weightless weapons. I really hope to get a weightless gamma gun one day. I have a weightless supressors gatling gun. It weighs like 3-5 pounds. Can't remember off the top of my head. I have a TSE gatling plasma I wish it was weightless the thing fully modded out weighs like 33 pounds. 
---
What a good boye
---
Level 30. It doesn't feel like a gift right now.
---
Finally had a chance to play this morning...
---
Holy shit!
---
I feel bad for all the enemies in this game. They don't stand a chance. 
---
I did not know this!! Thanks for the info!!!
---
I‚Äôm not an expert on that but I think Marine offer the highest resistances of all the non-PA options. 
---
Your system specs would help although I don't really see why it should go from slightly sluggish to downright shit. Weird.
---
I remember a couple of weeks ago I went to collect some other player's stash without realising it'd make me wanted. It happened at that mining supply store with the underground tunnel and it felt really tense hiding down there while hearing everyone moving around above me. Eventually I was shot as I was trying to make my escape.
---
Damn that sucks its like my favourite weapon 
---
Really interested to hear why.
---
Haven't tried it of late, but I had planted crop using the foundation glitch, had quite the garden at one point but needed the space for other things. 
---
I want companions like in ark where you take it and then you have to feed and water it but you can only have 1
---
Wait, you had trouble getting a second chassis? I've seriously dropped/scrapped so many of those. Currently sitting on two (one with the raider armor I can equip, the other with t60 that I can't). 
---
Excellent thanks, yeah I've got Reshade and Realistic gun sounds installed, so I'll get my folder sorted when I get back later. 
---
I‚Äôve noticed enemies of all sorts exhibit that strange behaviour of running away just out of sight and then coming back to me. Is there some sort of ‚Äúfear‚Äù mechanic I don‚Äôt know about? 
---
I'm fairly confidant in the future of the game, ESO was like that at release, but nowaday it's considered one of the best MMO's out there... so there is hope left !
---
I found out you can take creatures so at least he can live with you
---
Tattered dress does go over armor,  garb doesn‚Äôt.
---
Sometimes locked containers are empty.  It‚Äôs not a bug.
---
Edit: actually might have been 22 int for 120%.
---
You can also put T60 or X01 calibrated legs on your ultracite. 
---
Where'd you find this puppers??
---
Sigh.
---
Same I dropped 5 legendary items yesterday :(
---
I do that all the time, it's fun. 
---
The only thing that really tickles me the wrong way is when low levels take all your junk after you died because they think it's a gift or something. Had that happen twice now and while junk is not important to me it's still not nice. At least be so kind and wait for a 2-3 minutes, it usually doesn't take longer then that for anyone to respawn and return to their last place of death.
---
Are you trying to say my dog isn't allowed to meet my friends dog D:&lt;
---
YES 
---
I‚Äôve noticed the empty lootables but I assumed they were only tied to a 20 hr span like vendors caps.
---
Have somebody gotten a Camden daily since patch ? Or hot fix ?
---
You have a Fallout76Custom.ini set.  You need to fix it.  Either remove it or check the post here for what the default setting should be:
---
200 caps ?
---
This is outrageous, it's unfair!
---
I had to walk to the closest place I knew that had a chassis due to no caps for fast traveling, which was Mama Dolce's, and when I got there, they were already taken. I was heavily overencumbered due to holding some things to cell in my storage so I couldn't store anything on me. Had to server hop to grab it and walk all the way back to my base in Whitesprings. 
---
Yup , you get the occasional , can I have this or that for free , ruuunnn lol
---
Wow.
---
It's a wasteland after nuclear war, not only creatures are affected by radiation but people as well. Inside vault 76 everyone was safe but now everyone is exposed and most likely some people's brains can be affected really badly by radiation exposure.
---
It‚Äôs only ammo for the alien blaster and a plan to change the mags ( alien blaster plan ) 
---
I went pistol build for the first 50 or so levels. I am currently transitioning to a rifle build. That said, a pistol build will not feel adequate unless you use a pipe revolver bolt action build to double dip into rifle perks. You NEED armor penetration and that's how you will get it after the Somerset 44 is no longer damage relevant.
---
Later you can make the build work once you start getting legendary Western revolvers.
---
I tried this yesterday and it does seem to affect it the same as regular food items you have crafted
---
I noticed that getting a vintage nukashine blackout comes with new screens too
---
That's still a minor inconvenience for me. Seems like it would be super easy to put the condition in the HUD since it used to be in there for FO3 and FONV. Not only for melee weapons but guns as well.  
---
I'll check to see if this works for me thank you
---
THIS
---
I got the plans yesterday so yes they exist lol 
---
&gt; **Have you made something like this for new people or other players? What have you added to yours?** 
---
Basically something like what you've listed with at least one inescapable death trap
---
It‚Äôs the leash mechanic, most MMOs use it. Enemies have a max amount of range they can run from their spawn, sometimes the game derps out and makes them go to the end of their leash and come back 
---
I‚Äôve scraped 30 levers and still no harden receiver, rng sucks.  It‚Äôll pop soon, I can feel it lol. 
---
A lot screws and springs  down the drain.  
---
Why not both, like NV? 
---
Give him 100 lbs of extra carry weight too
---
I just go to flaatwoods to milk those 5 ones in there and then procede to transform them in to rib eye steak ( 20 extra carry weight ) is like having mini edible calibrated shocks 
---
Yes!!! 
---
I haven't gotten any dailies since the patch.
---
Hot dogs
---
There seems to be a serious issue with enemies running away at the moment, I chased a legendary deathclaw half way across the bloody map yesterday when it decided to leg it from a he nuke zone. It was funny for the first 5 minutes, then it became increasingly annoying.
---
I would love 1/2 stairs!! We could make 2,5 story homes :) very mid century design wise!
---
I did this tanagra with marsupial the first time , then I was back with a character with no marsupial and boy the gravity and camera are tough lol 
---
I agree, it would be nice, but at least there is a way that takes less than a second and you don't need to go into the pause menu. It'll also show the amount of ammo you have on you for a gun w/o equipping it. I like it personally.
---
Most lvl 15‚Äôs can‚Äôt do as you suggested, so your example is the exception, rather than the norm.
---
I was level 32 or something and Super Mutants Attacking to Finch Farm I noticed machine gun I built shoots burning rounds! And it was powerful.
---
I'm sry read that wrong. Got my Ultracite Cal Shocks plan from the SBQ. 
---
That is where I set up my camp. People keep coming through and murdering them. 
---
* radiation emote *
---
I started those quests around level 40, and didn‚Äôt have too many troubles - some fun challenges and a couple of corpse runs, but nothing that scared me away from continuing.
---
You could probably start a little sooner.
---
Thanks but in on PS4.  Still just wanna get the plans though.
---
Bloodied builds are easy to deal with, yeah they can one shot you, but also are super vulnerable.  Any high level weapon modded out can usually kill them if you can attack them first.
---
The real problem is how the pvp system works mechanically with slap damage and deciding when pvp starts, it makes it where ambushing people outside workshops is difficult because for the most part you can't hurt them until they attack you back, which makes bloodied builds so strong because you both start out relatively equal to each other in who gets first shot. So naturally a bloodied build will win. The survival mode will fix this massive glaring issue since combat will be on all the time, bloodied builds will be much weaker since you'll be running around at deaths door. Sentinel only works when standing still so its super broken in the current system where you have to wait but catch a bloodied sentinel while they are moving around the world and most vanilla non-legendaries could kill them. 
---
Legendaries give you a massive edge but honestly player damage is so high and max hp is low, armor piercing is abundant on many weapon types. Rifle can get a good chunk from a perk and more from magazines, melee have up to 75%, heavy guns can get 45%, even with a fully defensive perk tree and solid armor you'll melt most people. 
---
The situational effects only seem broken now because the weird pvp rules that allow the situational effects to apply almost always, in a free pvp situation a lot of the benefits are lost. Someone running full sentinel? Catch them when they are moving and not paying attention, with solid damage you might kill them, if not get out of their sight lines if they stand still like a rock. 
---
Killing is survival mode will probably be more about tactics than just which legendaries you have. Nothing happens in a vacuum so small changes can have big effects.
---
There's a button on your keyboard called "Enter". Use it! :)
---
If you go to the giant tea pot, and the Tea Time event starts. It will spawn ants
---
More like an avatar or mascot something static in to your Character and don‚Äôt give it the ability to carry or do anything other then being a cosmetic.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be so fleshed due to the server issue
---
directly west of beckwith farm on the cluster of mountains.
---
what a bunch of jerks. üò§
---
I just want the utters at my home base haha 
---
I‚Äôd even settle for milking him
---
Too little I was thinking of saving it for the legendary vendor 
---
The antique shop near watoga
---
Probably most of the "fans" not have much gaming history so their standards are much lower, a mediocre experience is a blast for them. They dont notice much issue except the really obvious ones.
---
I dont mind, if someone happy with the game, its common goal to have fun with Fallout 76, but anybody with atleast  normal standards should wait.
---
Tattered dress does but not eye of ra for some reason 
---
Some of those inconveniences listed are mere implemented by design so you won‚Äôt go an try to be logged in for 24 hrs straight , 76 was meant to be played on short bursts ( in theory compared to 4) by doing this you encourage your player base to be engaged daily and coming back daily and someday the whole they buy some atom points ü§ë
---
Sorry to be realistic but they clearly don‚Äôt care about much other then the end of the day investors return.
---
I find ants at the workshop near Charleston Hospital.
---
where is the door?
---
Dolly's wildlife cabins will also spawn ants sometimes in the cabins. Its top"ish" right of the map near Abbie bunker. Watch out for the yogi bears though. A few of them spawn to. good luck!  
---
I have done the Camden Daily the last 3 days.
---
Sentinel will be massively worse in survival since you start moving and its gone. If pvp is always active, you'll easily get ambushed right now pvp is so restrictive and set up easily that you can ensure your situational buffs pretty much apply all the time, but in a free for all wasteland you can't really rely on sentinel if you know you want to play the game, bloodied builds will be super bad, since you'll be a walking target 90% of the time. Being invisible will be your only choice really. 
---
No I have party boy to get +6str
---
 I didn't think the tri-barrel minigun mod existed in 76. Is it impossible to learn by crafting and requires a plan?
---
No, bloodied meat hook
---
Ouch. Was there not one at blackwater mines though? I've found one there reliably, usually with a couple pieces of raider armor (it's close to a vendor so I like to grab the pieces, sell them, but leave the chassis).
---
Can you imagine 24 Dogmeats on a server?  We could all get together an play with our doggos!  To heck with playing the game!  lol
---
They said they fixed it but I don't see any change
---
I have a tse dragon üêâ it‚Äôs 90 red weight , fires extra projectile , exploding ammo.
---
5 shots and it breaks ( not five but less then 10 for sure ) even with weapon artisan and gunsmith not sure if broken or by design since it‚Äôs like 300 per shot or so
---
As for quads I‚Äôve personally got a criolator , two short barrels shotguns , combat rifle , and that‚Äôs about it 
---
Same with me a few patches ago bruh
---
Yeah I have about 4 bookshelves lined up with barstools in front of that... looks pretty decent
---
I‚Äôm stocking on 3 stars and maybe the occasional 2 star I have probably close to 100
---
No it's a misc item.
---
Because pressing 20 buttons on a controller is definitely easier than pressing one key on the keyboard? I hope you're joking.
---
Riiiiight üòè
---
Have you ever had grilled cat meat? It's delicious.
---
Nice try Todd.
---
The power station that's just outside watoga, always spawns a deathclaw that fights ants
---
Nope. That was the first place I checked before treading up to Mama Dolce's. Guess I got really unlucky on the server I was on. :'D Didn't even think to server hop while at the mine at the time either until I did get the idea at Mama Dolce's. Still kicking myself over that, could've saved myself a trip.
---
Try any medical facilities or vault tec University
---
Aaaaa smart thing to do , reduce weight of items via mods marvelous!
---
It's rag doll physics. They explode and land in some random location, 50 yards away. Has been a problem in pervious FO games. If you kill something, then lob more grenades, or a car explodes, there's no telling where they'll end up. 
---
Did the same thing for my bf! And hey I remember you! Glad he made up for it!
---
That's a good thing.
---
Honestly the weird pvp system is the main blame. It allows situationaleffects to be active almost all the time in applicable since the system protects you when they arent. If you ran a bloodied sentinel build and pvp was free you would be weak anytime you decide to move.
---
Player damage is really high in general and you only become super durable when you exploit most of these situational effects. Survival mode will probably have a large focus on tactics and ambushes versus just straight who has the best legendaries. Yeah legendaries will help but when you take all these effects and apply them to a free pvp world a lot of the benefits melt away.
---
Can we name them??
---
Cool to know it‚Äôs not broken thanks :)
---
Oh, i was mistaken. its near top of the world 
---
Man, that's the worst. I hate traveling overweight. It takes so long. 
---
Those are the wrong one, the one with frills can only be fabricated once.
---
There were vats in Fallout 3?  An East Coast time traveling master clone does explain a lot of Bethesda's numerous continuity errors.
---
Yeah I mean I have a junkies in practical battle it shreds but having a prefix that gives you only 1 agility and added critical ( nailing a critical on a Gatling ? ) would be worth saving for legendary trader
---
The easiest one to find that is guaranteed is a boat at the Gorge Junkyard in the forest. There's a boat there on the eastern border with a box. It always has two of them if someone hasn't looted them alreadt.
---
Mine completed. They just have to survive the hit I think. I killed a ghoul in white springs, took half its health and completed it. 
---
There isn‚Äôt a laugh or lol emote either, one of the most basic human emotions... 
---
I've lost roughly 15 to 20% damage since the update. I even removed and reapplied AR with no change. For me to get the same damage pre patch I have to use a small guns bobblehead. Not quite sure what they fixed.
---
But wasn‚Äôt there some recent lawsuits by families of artists from even the 50‚Äôs that they won because of all the sampling and lack of credit that current artists were using those songs or lyrics or musical notes sections?  
---
Because the Puke emote is for saying you're dying of rads
---
Nice try Todd Howard
---
I still get mods from scrapping guns. Ik I haven't gotten a hunting rifle mod in a while because I already have all of them. Maybe you're just scrapping ones you have all the mods for?
---
Hmm my cousin just said that happened to him last night before we started playing. 
---
Strange, not heard of that before on here, must be a first?
---
You're smarter than that.
---
Oh burn!
---
posted in wrong reddit in accident but i can do 600.
---
I'm still rocking my freedom Bird paint on my X-01 closest thing to a medic paint job I can find.
---
You want pyramids ?
---
Conspiracy theories lol just sit back and watch everything unfolds. 
---
As for the game play, why should a new/junior player be punished at all? If you‚Äôre good you should be rewarded by the game system not the guy you just beat who probably has emptied his account before joining the fight (which shouldn‚Äôt be necessary at all). There‚Äôs no guarantee of any reward to do pvp unless you only target the new and uninformed. 
---
It would be a real joke for the dedicated pvp server when everyone cleared their caps and junks before joining. A complete waste of time for every participant. 
---
If I could redesign the PVP component of the game (I‚Äôve actually worked at a game company before lol) I won‚Äôt need dedicated pvp servers. Pacifists will be marked as a green dot and PVPers would be marked as a red dot on the map and also crosshair. Within certain range the map won‚Äôt show the location of PVPer so they need to look for each other to fight (similar to the hardcore mode in other shooter games). Pacifists can‚Äôt harm others nor be harmed. With those settings Pvpers will ignore pacifists and look for other pvpers to fight because they will simply waste their time and ammo for nothing if they harass Pacifists. All perks, level boosts, armors, and legendary effects are only for PVE. For PVP a 308 round is a 308 round, it will have the same damage no matter you‚Äôre level 1 or 150 wearing fancy armors. It‚Äôs a survival game so let the fittest survive, not those who dress themselves up with duped items. Reward should come from the system not the dead, who may or may not have the caps that worth your fight. 
---
There are many excellent shooter games out there such as COD and Battlefield where a new player can own a high ranking veteran if you‚Äôre good at shooting and tactics. Not in fo76. At current state for a junior player unless you go out and buy a set of magic armor and op guns off ebay, you‚Äôre just a pile of walking caps to dimwit griefers, majority of which have no skills whatsoever. 
---
Pathetic
---
Enemies can spawn at higher level if there are high-level players around. Probably someone else was messing around in there, causing the 60s to spawn.
---
Dude you're complaining about a game on The games respective subreddit, why the hell are you looking on its sub if you hate it? You're looking for attention like the sad little person you are and want people to acknowledge you. 
---
Nice. Now I can do my cosplay of Dale Gribble. Bounty Hunter ah sha sha sha!
---
will wait about 5 more min
---
That's possible, but it doesn't explain the syringer issue, unless you somehow cannot get those mods from scrapping. I can still only use a base syringer/ammo.
---
You don't really make different kinds of stringer ammo like in 4. In FO76 the ammo is actually a mod you put on the syringer. For example, you won't learn or make radscorpion poison ammo, you'll make a radscorpion poison mod for your syringer that turns all syringer ammo to that type. Likewise, for some reason syringer plans are kind of rare. I made about 25 of them last night and scrapped them all. All I learned was reflex sight, glow sight, glow reflex sight, maybe a 2x scope, some kind of grip and the radscorpion stinger poison mod. Keep scrapping them. They're just hard to get mods for. 
---
In my experience twin shot is not that great on a Gauss as it tends to miss. The exploding on the other hand is incredible, and if you were to find a furious exploding or an AA that would be a god roll.
---
Ok, thanks, I will just have to keep scrapping then. Afterwards, I just modify one to attach the mods then, correct?
---
It on same tab a mothman poster
---
The Beach Boys for screwed over totally by either their label or manager. They actually received almost zero for the hits we know them for. Bad contracting. The sued and lost. But then I haven‚Äôt looked lately. They may have appealed and or come to some agreement but they jealously guard the use of Any of their work because they worked so hard to find out they were broke not because of sales because of agreed to pay rates. Idk if they ever got rights to the masters. But they feel rightly so they have lost so much money hey could have lived so much better that if you want to use that era of their work you will PAY. It doesn‚Äôt cover all their work, these mismanagement times, I think they had to dissolve and reform or some such. But nothing after reached the popularity of the songs this generation would recognize from the reformed times. Sucks there were selfish bloodsucking lawyers then....oh wait their still around...they probably advises Bethesda on the atom shop....
---
Yeah. It sucks, but I managed. 
---
Only ts? Those are tse prices lmao
---
I actually had it happen the other way around. I died while doing an event and the high lvl dudes took my junk. I was sad. Maybe they thought I owed them for carrying me through the event. 
---
i can't help i love having everything of each type 
---
Found the Chinese restaurant. 
---
Yeah, he knew he messed up and wanted to make sure he made up for it properly. And since he knows my weakness is good food, I can safely say he is back on my good side. 
---
How did your BF like it? I hope he appreciated it! Getting the Nuka Quantum Paint for the X-01 Armor isn't easy.
---
I understood that reference. 
---
Its one key per server
---
I had this happen yesterday, and I waited and ran around for 5 to 10 minutes or so, and it finally turned into a metal pile where I could finally get my legendary. 
---
and then they get ban  and like i sey they have no purpose then just being cosmetic OR they create a wardrobe like TESO problem solve no more outfit in the inventory taking place for nothing 
---
Dude you‚Äôre awesome! Thank you for that. It worked! 
---
This is still a fucking issue. Happened in the middle of my SBQ fight. Fuck this game dude
---
Wow. That is so dumb 
---
I just found these last night. I NEED that little black kitty to be my pet!
---
A brahmin pen is actually a lot, after the update its almost 3 turrets, it still takes up around 10% or so
---
Wouldn't Vim! Armor be the opposite?

Yes.

What paint is the blue and white on your right leg? I like that one. Is it the toy paint?

You mean found the communist.

Right but when the thing blows up right away and my screen is all fire, I can't see where they flew. Wasn't a huge problem before where there was a slight delay so I could move back to observe dem physics
---
I've had issues of late with VATS hits on my sniper not registering, for example it'll display TORSO 95 but inflict no damage whatsoever?? When fending off a horde of Super Mutants it can be the difference between life or death. I have a better chance at times of scoping in and taking them out that way. 
---
Glad I could help, I love my camp location. Hope others found this out before relocating. 
---
Strange in numbers is broken. The only thing it helps so far is jumping even higher. I'd rather have damage than jumping now although. Unless they figured out what they did and fix it because I'm upset with "jumping damage numbers". 
---
I've ran the numbers tried different theories. Just gonna leave it as a stealth nerf in my mind.

It‚Äôs all physics not random. The robots were too dumb in the past, this actually adds a nice little challenge. I kinda like it üòÇ

Maybe we should put you on the grill instead. I guarantee at least some of us have the cannibal perk - but we wouldn‚Äôt need it because you‚Äôre actually a monster.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm Xbox one as well. Tried it lastnight. Disconnected within 10 minutes. No issues with my internet provider.
---
Could you give me more info on Speed Demon?
---
I‚Äôve looked through all of my posters and cannot find it 
---
Possibly. I think they nerfed bloodied without telling
---
Here's my CAMP located next to the overseer CAMP. Not shown is the nukashine poster on the back side of my Welcome Home sign.

It's too bad it only shows up while I'm logged in and only for people on the server so very few people will ever see it. I think it would be pretty neat to have a way for player CAMPs to show up randomly even when that player isn't logged in.  Also a guest book so people can leave messages.
---
Hahaha, thought the same thing - you put it in there and wait, just keep checking back on it
---
the BOS labcoat may spawn at the antique shop in  the cranberry bogs
---
Definatly. But also my non bloodied lever is missing DMG too. Who knows. Lol
---
Show us the doggo
---
I changed my pip-boy to white in FO4 and it also changed my flashlight to white. It was such a good feature that I miss. The classic green is cool and all but doesn't illuminate the way I would imagine a real flashlight would. 
---
Just wait.
---
They seem to arrive very close to where you actually place the camp machine. So if you put it inside they will spawn below it. 
---
You drank too much Nukashine and lost them during a blackout. Happens to the best of us. 
---
No other games have been crashing like this. Well, ff15 used to, but now it doesnt seem to crash that much. I'll try to do the driver reinstall later, or just install new drivers. I dont think I have done that in a while. I'll see.
---
I have also had a very good run of RNG experience the last few days, with several good 2\*-3\* Legendary Items.
---
I'm trading for it too
---
You‚Äôre on the fallout 76 subreddit complaining about fallout 76
---
You can dislike it I get it but constant complaining about it won‚Äôt change the fact that other people do like it
---
Yeah dude, you gotta slow down man people who care about you are worried...
---
(Try server hopping maybe? Not sure)
---
Hmm, I'll have to check into that
---
Seems about right
---
I put my current CAMP next to Morgantown Station to make dropping off junk/plans/etc. easy, as well as giving quick access to crafting, beds, instruments, and purified water to low-level players that might need it. Now with razorgrain and corn for your brewing needs! haha
---
It's just to act as a timer to tell you when it becomes vintage. Also if you have unfermented in a fermenter it has a timer to show how long until it's ready
---
Night vision scopes and the karma barrel can't be learned from scrapping. All other mods can be learned by scrapping. They just have a low or very low learn chance. 
---
Strange in numbers helps all my mutations, including adrenal (when it works). I notice huge improvement to my stats.
---
Scrap your syringers. 
---
luck is what makes rifles and pistols viable. i run crit chance, crit increase, crit cost reduction on my pisol char and i can deal quite some damage on pistols with increased crit damage. its all about crits sadly
---
Now imagine a gatling gun with the drum mag. It would have a total of 2k bullets in one reload. No reload for days 
---
Bethesda wasn‚Äôt counting on helpful players?
---
what is the lemonade stand ? where can i find it ?
---
I agree, you have to clear out the place the first time to claim the workshop. There shouldn‚Äôt be an event to defend it again.
---
Gotcha. Thanks man
---
Yes sir, unfortunately you can only use one syringer type at a time, which is a huge bummer compared to 4. I've considered making 2 or 3 syringers with my favorite poisons so I could swap them on the go rather than having to constantly remod whenever I want to use something else. 
---
I don't think they do, just keep on scrapping them. If you're on Xbox, I can make both for you 
---
Got it, thanks. I'll keep trying.
---
Yes that‚Äôs probably what I‚Äôll end up doing 
---
Good luck!
---
You mean Marge? Yeah, she's pretty awesome.
---
GAUSS MAN DELIVERED
---
It's a random spawned vendor along the lines of Grahm, he sells the recipes for Lemonade and Hard Lemonade, pretty much as rare as Grahm as well.
---
I‚Äôve never experienced this, but my gauss rifle does some pretty stupid shit sometimes that makes me have to weapon swap.. like charging up after a full charge and then not firing 2-3 times when release, or getting stuck in a bugged view and not be able to release or fire a shot
---
I wouldn't start over...too limiting.  I enjoy the game...finding stuff. Improving etc...I dont need quest to be happy with it. I think that's why I like it so much. No go here do that, or get past this and find that kind of stuff.
---
I have had my camp in this location for like 2 months now. I've only been told 1 time that someone was in my spot, and it never has said anything since the update about not being able to build there. That's super strange, and I'm sorry I dont have any advice. I would just rebuild there. Put your camp down, logout, log in, see if it says it again maybe. Best of luck!
---
I think strange in numbers doesn't work because of the herd mentality mutation because it doesn't work either. But for some reason try the method. (Be on a team then check damage, go off the team and then check damage again.)
---
Yes, it's just stupid rare
---
I‚Äôve never had marsupial and have done it at least 4 times. You gotta follow the path. There‚Äôs only one spot that you have to jump a little bit. Right after coming out of the cave with the cave crickets 
---
Yeah I actually tried that already. I even tried hopping in and out a few times before re-placing it. Your camp is on and utilizes the lead pit, yeah? Have you checked today?
---
Heart is sorry. Gift enough would be nice though.
---
I'll say, I main heavy weapons and must've scrapped at least 20+ Miniguns by now without seeing it. I just gave up and assumed it wasn't in game.
---
I'm guessing they did it as a quick easy way to make it private and player specific
---
Damn ! Hope i found one someday, thanks
---
This happened to me at alpha.  I had to rebuild 4 times before I found a stable spot. I also lost my fusion generator, 4 industrial water purifiers, and decontamination arch to the game eating them during the moves.
---
The build zones are bugged.
---
I‚Äôve got 5 to sell. How much you paying
---
Welcome to the Wasteland...from The raiders 
---
Herd mentality works fine for me. My damage goes up fine unless strange in numbers is active. I found teleporting causes my damage to go up to the right amount, until I return to camp.
---
So what you want is even more reason to make this a single player game? I think they should focus on making it more of a multiplayer game. 
---
i would totaly understand if i could defend myself.
---
I killed the queen a couple times yesterday, got one star wood left arm and the left leg. High rolling
---
This is basically what I've got set up outside of Morgantown Station.
---
* All workbenches, stash box, etc.
---
* Water purifiers &amp; pump
---
* Campfire with all instruments
---
* Guest bedroom
---
* Corn &amp; razorgrain for brewing
---
* The Wasted On Nukashine poster, but I don't have anything pointing to it, unfortunately.
---
I have the Decontamination plans, but haven't set it up because I'm paranoid. I might do it anyways. Being across from the station adds a vendor (as well as having the one in the airport terminal), and I routinely leave spare water/stims/rad\_/ammo/low level items in the green suitcase, as well.

Barbar is correct
---
Thanks bro but I need 50+
---
I got the orange there too
---
I‚Äôm done fighting SBQ. My game crashes EVERY time
---
Why so many? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking
---
Idk what's going on with it tbh. I had my damage breaking 5k but now after patch it's hard to even get it to 3.5k with the effect of passing out with the nukashine. I wanted to see what 5k would turn into with vintage nukashine but not all dreams can come true
---
Per/Agi/Luck all the way.  
---
Crit, crit, crit.
---
Wow, awesome find. Thank you for sharing this!
---
End game player.. all I do is drop nukes lol 
---
IMO: 
---
on a minigun hell no, it eats way to much ammo to be efficient.  primes work better on the slower firing weapons for the sole reason of you dont eat flux like crazy. 
---
 if you get 1 good slowfiring weapon to have as a dedicated SB/Q then it would be worth it.
---
I sure hope the new legendary combat rifle is the 308 variant. 
---
Just completely random magazine locations. Outside the vault. They are connected to magazines. On the cover they say ‚Äúincludes free holotape game‚Äù
---
The lock is for something you don't know the plans for. I'm guessing there's an item in your camp that someone else crafted for you. You should be able to place your camp since all the pieces are stored. It's more likely that the old blueprint is just broken after all the camp fixes  Otherwise, scrap the blueprint, and you can rebuild it. You should even be able to place whatever pieces you can't craft since they're already build and stored with your base.
---
Magazines can have games with them. It's pretty rare to find that kind though.
---
Still still
---
Maybe they will finally fix it soon. 
---
Nah but let's see it realistically, what they did there was definitly trying to stretch theyr content but was the model present in fo4 really that bad for that? 
---
Why not let people sell for caps so they can actually buy stuff from the vendors? Why does it have to feel like necessarities are a waste of caps to keep people occupied?
---
Thanks, will check out both those places :)
---
But there's like everything to sell for vendors. It hardly matters what you use?
---
Hopefully
---
nah i just play the game, what's the point of playing if you're just going to buy the achievements?
---
For the excavator, the responder bender at Camden Park sells them. For all of the others, the BoS bender at Watoga. 
---
hi OP - i believe it is just a random reward.  I got mine today, can't wait to try them :)
---
Yes he freaked out when I showed him it was possible to get it. It was his absolute favorite in fallout 4 and he wanted so badly in this game after seeing the nuka cola paint for the t51b. Also I found out about it right after the servers went down for a hot fix and right when they came back up, I got on and went for it. So I got lucky to say the least 
---
Windows 10 64 bit

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB

&gt; I have keys for at least one other room, but it doesn't really have anything interesting.
---
I think that gives a PA color plan but that's old. This new thing wasn't accessable before.
---
I use the lone wamderer perk. That add to my reasons of not accepting group invites. One of them bein that i feel most would like me to plug a mic after grouping.
---
Also, i often receive invites from people on the other side of the map. I get most of them just want to fast travel, but...
---
Ultra everything at 1440p, my VRAM maxes out (8gb), 12k KB Commited, 5K KB Working set for fo76.  Yes its using a ton of memory, I'm not having crash issues from it though.  I'm not sure why you would have an issue with a game using your computers resources, they are suppose to do that, its far faster than reading everything from HD.
---
Where and how do you get any of these legendary Gauss rifles? Asking for a friend :)
---
Yo.  If there are attack dogs.
---
Can we build hunter classes?!!!!
---
I think the idea is great but with the settlement build issues, such as allowing certain pieces to overhang past the edge limit, the edge limit being a circle, and just the overall bugginess of the game in general I have a feeling that this, if it ever comes to 76, will be in the form of a full dlc. That said it is also likely that at that point you will need to be able to keep track of not just your camp location but others as well. If you load into a game and the spot your next door settlement neighbor parks at is taken, then only part of the settlement can be placed. Therefore they would most likely need (and in my opinion already do need) an option to skip all worlds that have camps in any of the spots required. It‚Äôs really annoying to have to gamble the die to reload a new world but then find you have to try it again because someone was in your spot. Yes I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôve partially updated that mechanic but there needs to be an option to bypass any world with your spot taken
---
Where my player is
---
Very interesting...
---
There is actually a bug that affects me in loading screens that I wish would be corrected, but it's minuscule and doesnt affect gameplay.
---
I have 3 monitors in my setup that I switch between depending on how I want to play
---
1 is 21:9 ultrawide
---
1 is 16:10 pc monitor
---
1 is 16x9 television
---
if I take screenshots in any one of those, they are distorted on any others.  so if I take a screenshot in 21x9, then go over to my tv and play, if that screenshot shows up, its squished really bad.
---
if i take a screenshot in 16x10 and then go to ultrawide, its stretched really bad.
---
I wish, instead of stretching the pictures, they forced them fullscreen but maintained aspect ratios.  That would require black bars on the top and bottom of varying sizes, but I wouldnt care
---
I love the feature itself though!
---
Someone has a post on here listing all mods by rarity, I think all the heavy mods are listed under 'very rare'
---
Yesterday, a player invited me to a team so I could help out clear out the Deathclaw cave for Bunker Buster. I hadn't gotten that far w tracking the story missions normally (hadn't even been to the Mire at all lol), and now I'm an official member of the Enclave, trying to earn his stripes!
---
The power of the atom, Fallout 3. Easily more fun when you get to watch a nuke destroy an entire town off in the distance. 76s version of that is ok but battling wave after wave after wave gets old after your second nuke launch
---
That's great! I'm happy he loved it. Just hope my BF freaks out the same way when I give him his set of armor. XD 
---
You can't change your username or email on PSN either. It's locked in. When I realized this I had to use my alternate email for the username I actually wanted to use. üôÑ
---
Shit, not even that. He can have zero value other than being a good boi. I just want a dog to chill with. 
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me before too. Once during a queen, and another time at my friends house. He wanted a cool picture with explosions in the background....and it just went straight though the walls. 
---
Thx! This is great! Any clean ones?
---
A thumbs up goes a long way in terms of thanking someone (but a thank you emote would be cool too) 
---
The eye only works with the garb sadly,  so if you can‚Äôt put the garb over armor the eyes can‚Äôt be used.
---
That‚Äôs sounds fun. Well if you wanna drop 5 more let me know lol
---
Does it not anymore? Before 2 patches or so ago (whichever adjuster destroying camp placed objects as PvP acts) that was exactly the case. I always had pacifist and even launching a two shot mini nuke pre-nerf at their base did 0 damage. If it does damage now then I honestly won‚Äôt be surprised
---
You mean the North Korean.
---
Yes, I've seen no Daily quests since patch 7. I did get Miscellaneous (non-daily) repeatable quests though like the Hemlock Holes cook.
---
You might wanna lower your price by a lot. I don‚Äôt think many people here will be wanting to pay for a TSE that‚Äôs missing the E. 
---
Yea idk I've played a shit ton since the patch and havent run into any of that whatsoever. Just yesterday put about 7 hours in. Maybe try reinstalling? I know thats a pain in the ass but might be worth a try if its that bad for you right now. 
---
No, because people suck.
---
If one more person kills my fertilizer-making brahmin...
---
I like it.
---
I‚Äôll buy them if you can do 50 caps per card? 
---
Got my nuka cola quantum x01 plans this morning on my 3rd try after server hopping last nite for 45min. (With tnt dome key in hand)
---
Added the paint scheme to my x01 ...looks awesome! Got some strange reactions at white springs shortly after! 
---
"How and where did you get that??"
---
Ohhhh if you only knew....was worth it!üòÅüòÅ
---
I learned the recipe yesterday. If you are on PC and bring the ingredients I can craft them for you and you can ferment them. IGN: jchamlin
---
I bet he will! The paint is absolutely amazing 
---
These grenades are awesome because they also do radiation damage which I hadn't seen yet. The explosion it gives off could be bigger but it's still cool nonetheless. 
---
You can tame animals with a high charisma.
---
I found some, it's definitely a reward from those dailies. 
---
Someone provided a fix. If you put the floors they are on in your storage the turrets appear in your storage with the floors.
---
It looks so gorgeous and it stands out a lot. I'm glad to have gotten and and I'll keep everyone updated on his reaction when I give it to him.
---
Find some invisibility armor. I use it with an endangerol syringer, then go in with melee
---
I swear to fuck the people complaining on this sub don't even play the fucking game.
---
Yeah but all week? I play 2-5 hrs daily and nothing.
---
Totally agree. I've used Molotovs to take out the glitched ones. Hopefully that helps
---
A lot of people use workshop events to farm plans, which is why they aren't universally hated.  
---
That is part of an online game. Dealing with people. Granted some of the mechanics to destroy others camps suck, but it is just something we have to deal with. At some point bethesda will have to decide what direction they want to take this. Make this game to easy if you play in a group. Or make this game to hard if you play solo. They can not have both. They do not know how to accomplish that. 
---
How else do you think you're going to get fertilizer?
---
Seriously, though, it surprised me, too. I had to redesign my C.A.M.P. so that the brahmin wasn't walking on everything.
---

You can milk anything that has nipples.

Just want to add that when you are at the basement of the Overlook, check if the TNT Dome key is gone before using the paired keys.  If the key is gone, the door should be open and you should see an EMPTY PEDESTAL.  But if the door is closed, the TNT Dome key is likely inside (unless some jerk took the key and closed the door).  The paired keys are one-time use only as already mentioned.  If you see an empty pedestal and you still use the paired keys, then you have no one but yourself to blame.
---
While the paired keys are one-time use only, the TNT Dome key itself is NOT one-time use.  It is spawned once per server as mentioned, but it is NOT one-time use.   Once you get it, you can use it infinite times and it stays in your inventory.  If you use it to open Dome 7 and the Quantum paint plan is gone, you just hop server and open Dome 7 again until you see the paint plan.
---
Fallout 76 is the most imbalanced game I‚Äôve ever played but probably not of all time. Maybe from a AAA developer though. I believe it will eventually feel balanced but I also 100% believe that‚Äôs a few years down the road. Anthem (another horribly launched mess) did have one major positive in the community. The game is solely PVE. Even for a role playing game such as Fallout where immersion is at all time high, why the absolute f@&amp;$, after being chosen as the best and brightest of the nation, would I go out, and immediately attack and kill the people I‚Äôve lived with and relied on for 25 years. The people asking for PVP were far outnumbered by those who didn‚Äôt want it but it was added to provide a more feature complete feel and to add the competitive crowd. The issue is that this game is so unbelievably imbalanced that the few who really want it can easily break the game to their advantage. PVP should‚Äôve been left at the door and added as a side project. But this is the game we‚Äôre given and we have no choice but to hope that the game eventually turns into something that you find enjoyment in
---
The timer is something like 20 hours...why cant you just go sell to all the factions then wait a day and do it again?
---
I‚Äôve never in my life paid real money for an in game purchase but I would pay real money for a pet, and more if it was a companion. They have to be unkillable but I‚Äôm totally okay if as a companion they don‚Äôt actually contribute to the fighting at all.
---
But what if your character is a full time alcoholic hobo and not just pretending to be one for a challenge? Just throwing down a cooking pot and a sleeping bag wherever they wake up and saying "well, guess I'm (hic) home now" seems like it would be really fitting.
---
If you played the game, you'd know how the supermutants are there.
---
I removed it and all mods. Still was happening.  I deleted the game, folder for the game and I'm downloading it again to see if that works. 
---
If you strategically set up turrets in key spots at your workshop then it will defend itself. It sounds like you just need to learn the workshops choke points. I've had many workshops at the same time and when the defend prompt comes up I will usually ignore and get "free" xp and items and plans 5 minutes later. Good luck. 
---
I found a level 40 Bloodied Explosive Western Revolver with 15% VATS and am currently using a 1* bloodied bolt action pipe with it. Aside from being a level 40 I feel like this should be the most OP pistol in the game........ it's not! .......I hardly ever have any reason to use it over my 1* pipe. It take 2-3 shots to kill bots in Watoga.
---
Pistols need armor pentration!!!.....they should benefit from the tank killer perk. 
---
Like I said, it would be nicety.  But to answer your question, I don‚Äôt log exactly when I was at exact vendor location last.   And some days you wanna get on, do you sales runs while you have time.  Would be semi nice to know if/which vendors are around to even fall in that window of play time. 
---
You can attack first if the other player is inside the workshop pvp zone, though you should have pacifist mode turned off. As for cost of materials anything that shows up green in materials when you're building are not your materials, they belong to the workshop. I can usually claim a workshop and build resource generators without using my own supplies.

https://www.greenfacts.org/en/chernobyl/l-2/3-chernobyl-environment.htm#4
---
If they were to allow villages, I imagine they would need entirely different build-rules. Say a very tight 2x6 build footprint on pre-determined foundation slots and defined throughways. Would each villager's camp be locked into a given server in which case villages would have too many vacancies to be meaningful, or would they be cross-server buildings with presumably very high rents to managed the demand for such slots?   
---
It's an interesting idea, but I fear it's largely academic. If they don't create a meaningful endgame (which the road map aims for), then all the village slots will be ghost-towns. 
---
Another good thing to note is there may be a second custom files saved under:  Users/(you)/Documents/my games/Fallout 76 
---
They could totally implement a pet system. 
---
I just wish they'd make her un-targetable - I've stupidly shot her more than once :/  
---
As stated previously, if you walk around then come back it will show up. Had to do this a few times and haven't lost anything completely (knock on wood). It's frustrating but it's a work around since it's likely never gonna get fixed.
---
Not true. I've had my CAMP device on the ground floor on the other side of my house and my teammate will spawn inside of my extractor or under my foundation. I've had to redesign part of my house to combat this issue. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
They could add a dog park or something where you can have your dog sniff the butts of other dogs.
---
That's a shame the only paint jobs for excavator and ultracite will be for $$
---
A tip from me would be to stockpile bulk junk or chems and hit each vendor faction one after the other to get your 1400. If that's all you can get done for the day cool, if you have time after go do whatever and stock up on what you unload again. If you do them all at the same time then it makes it less confusing who still has caps. 
---
I have caps burning a hole in my...wherever it is that we keep caps. I'd love to see what you got. Still open for trading?
---
I agree.  And that‚Äôs exactly what I try to do.  But I‚Äôm kind (A LOT) ADHD and a ‚Äúquick cap run‚Äù is often sidetracked.  
---
I started with NV, went back to 3, had it CTD constantly once I got into the urban areas, and then promptly uninstalled. 
---
I was actually really enjoying it up until the crashes. xD  Though I will say, if I had played 4 before 3, that would change things because 4 is the game that really modernized the gunplay and physics. 
---
Moo!
---
i‚Äôve been farming magazines to get all of the games for three days now and i‚Äôve found one game so i can definitely confirm that they‚Äôre rare
---
Didn't think of that.  I put all my games and mods on a different drive than everything else. So I don't even think about anything in the user folder.  
---
When you paint your power armor while drinking nukashine 
---
Yea I‚Äôll do that gt PD 211x 
---
Great
---
Sorry to hear it. Yeah, I can relate. My last three SBQ attempts were busts: 
---
1. Pre-patch, lots of attackers, and scaling or zero damage bug. 
---
2. Post-patch, beat the Queen. No loot loaded. 
---
3. Post-patch, queen was about to die. I got disconnected from the server. 
---
I might join a Queen in progress if it's convenient, but there's no way I'd take the time to go through a silo. None of the other online games I play disconnect even one-tenth as often. 
---
xD Sorry I laughed but you can get it. I don't have marsupial either. You can always craft or buy a jetpack too.
---
Definitely do-able. I did it in power armour because I was concerned about falling to my death
---
But Fallout 4 hasnt been out for 4 years? Holy smokes I can't believe its been out for about 3 and a half though!
---
I've picked up the only one I found in vault 76
---
Focus grasshopper focus.
---
Now I see why people only join mine. Who in the world would want to waste this kind of time.
---
This doesn't seem true for me either.
---
Could you join me bro? 
---
My actual biggest surprise was the lack of any sort of ‚Äúhub‚Äù where you could meet up, trade, maybe buy property and stuff. Having a thriving community is really what this game needs. Been watching sodapoppins GTA roleplay vods (dont usually watch him) and it‚Äôs fucking brilliant. Maybe some day the pc version of 76 could be something closer to that. 
---
Yea what‚Äôs gt
---
Kingsmokeyyy
---
The dev confirmed that the full set is in game, not just the tactical mask but the real marine combat helmet, look in post above
---
How much for it?
---
give us special fast travel targets. ones that allow for specified travel. so say i put mine in front of my vendor so people can find it instantly. have it have a terminal option to allow you to toggle "Admin only" "Admin and Friends" and "All Users" where you place it is where people will spawn on arrival.
---
Damage reduction doesn't account radiation at all. Keep that in mind.
---
The game is whoever hits who first, because bloodied builds do thousands of points of damage anyhow.
---
Pvp is a manner of clicking vats and forgetting. This problem is more apparent now that vats is fixed.
---
They could permanently fix all of this by nerfing bloodied damage output or remove stacking damage in general.
---
" **I have noticed a huge increase in quality** " sure. i just got dc 5 times today. when i had no dc weeks ago. 
---
Awesome work, I really feel myself in the moment üôèüëçüòÄ
---
I am lvl 23 and i can't see those plans in the vendors people commented. Is this a lvl capped plan after the non-lvl-cap patch? 
---
You can find Grognak in the Grafton dam on top of one of the rooms with the pipe on top, its behind there with a magazine.
---
Is pvp prevalent? Everybody I‚Äôve met I‚Äôve shared a wave with then we went our own ways 
---
Absolutely! There's so much functionality that could come out of the terminal, and this is just another example.
---
I'm kind of glad tbh. I fly into a psychotic rage when anyone harms dogmeat in fo4.
---
I've got a Quad explosive double barrel I use on Her Royal Highness and I'd say it's worth it mainly because fluorescent flux is pretty much the easiest to farm since it's in plentiful supply at Whitespring. I have about 5k Ultracite shotgun shells at any given time.
---
For other types of ammo/weapon, I guess it depends on how willing you are to farm the flux you need; it's kind of annoying having to collect mass/fluids at WS then having to drop a second nuke just to collect flux. But as I understand it, the Fissure Prime site is decent for collecting violet flux so if that's what you need then I guess it could be just as easy as farming WS to make fluorescent idk.
---
Better Idea. NO DOG NPCS. Playable dogs. You squad up with your team and you create a dog and you play it. Collect some items of course, downside: they have to take care of you.
---
Its a fucking dumb Idea and the Engine is too bad for it but anything to make this game fun! 
---
I broke down the math in a previous thread of mine. If you have max crit savy and a 15 luck, the other crit chance perks are a waste.
---
I imagine player hubs would have just been slideshows, especially near launch. Too many people causing too much lag. 
---
That said, I feel like there may be a player hub coming eventually, once the game is polished enough.  Maybe with the Wastelanders update. :-)
---
Not glitched.  Someone took it before you. 
---
Calm down... lol
---
Theres one per server
---
Thumbs up or heart are generally understood to mean "thank you" in most circumstances.
---
Personally I mostly only do thumbs up in group events when we win (SBQ for example) and save the heart for when someone drops me something good.
---
That said, our emote system could use some work. I'd also like a "look here" or "gift" emote to signify I've dropped something for someone. For some reason people tend to run away screaming from a level 254 in ritual bindings even though I'm simply trying to be nice.
---
How? Why would the ID cards spawn in the first place than? So basically big ass waste of time with no way of knowing if someone else already claimed them.
---
Hey. If you wanted dibs you're too late on it bub. That hot dog is all mine. I already ordered the doggy bag son, so you're going to need to find your dog food elsewhere. üåù
---
I'll help you kill her if you're on ps4, killed her 3 times yesterday. 
---
Use vats. If you have some ap left the vats camera will follow the bot for a sec or two before cancelling. This way you can see roughly where it goes. 
---
lol
---
Your just late. Got mine 10 mins after the guy posted how to get it.  
---
It can be wendigo or radscorpion from time to time. But Deathclaw is common. 
---
Has anyone found the long barrel plan? I have one that is dmg +50% limb and +30% against ghouls, but after reading this I definitely hope I find more legendary ones in the future. 
---
Yep, now that you mention it, I am missing 4 water purifiers, all my crops, and my bramin pen
---
That‚Äôs exactly the point. Most people don‚Äôt care. The few who do however can easily break the game to make your life really annoying. Hence why it‚Äôs so easy to be one shot killed. It‚Äôs SLIGHTLY better than launch in that there are slightly less ways to one shot but the players who really wanted PvP found the new OP builds after each nerf and use those instead
---
I had a hell of a time defending Grafton Steel against wave after wave of Radscorpions yesterday. Burrowing critters are the bane of my existence.
---
On that note, does anyone know if there's a formula to how many waves you have to fight? There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason; I can understand 4 waves of nasties at, say, Abandoned Bog Town but then just one wave of radrats at Grafton Steel? It doesn't make sense.
---
Raw flux value was lowered.  Inert flux was made worthless.  It was in the patch notes. 
---
Keep scrapping. It‚Äôs rng. I just recently got the bloatfly one being level 167 I got most of them back at level 50 below. 
---
Thx
---
Getting the key is just step 1 of the frustration. Getting the plans is another.
---
Reminds me of when you play as Frankin's dog in GTA 5
---
I want the vtec 2. That's out of control. The quantum paint is ugly but the head looks good imo.
---
Theres a guaranteed lab coat in one of the army jeeps behind the whitesprings, on the side near the whitesprings service entrance. I'm pretty sure it's the jeep right next to the parked buses
---
There are few PVPers, but it doesn't take many wolves to take down a whole lot of sheep.   
---
All of my friends who play have been attacked at least once when they held public workshops. It's not a big deal if you know how the game mechanics work. We have been surprised lately that some PVPers have  even attacking really low level people who are certainly not worth many caps (e.g. a friend's level 11 alt got killed two days ago). 
---
I liked getting 75 purified water and 20 ballistic fiber the other day..was a pleasant surprise
---
D
---
Read it now
---
Thank you! I'll be in touch in a few hours when I get back home. Do you know the ingredients? 
---
whats the helmet paints?
---
I‚Äôm really exited about that one :) 
---
Ok Thank you
---
I think the ghouls attack my scarecrow because it‚Äôs the first thing they get to when coming at my campü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they do seem attracted to the scarecrows but it may just be coincidenceü§î
---
Could you defend yourself irl from a sniper if you didn‚Äôt know they were there?
---
Heart works really well (but I could understand a kid not wanting to make that emote) but I agree- a ‚Äòthanks‚Äô ‚Äòhere‚Äôs a gift‚Äô and ‚Äòoops- sorry‚Äô would be helpful
---
This is worth like 350 lol
---
Be good for the queen fight if your a bloody build. I would like a drop like that but not necessarily looking to buy one. 
---
Thanks for your subjective opinion.
---
I have also noticed that legendary robots in Watoga still explode immediately after death. Happened twice after the hot fix. 
---
Foundation built structures in general 
---
Doesn't sound remotely related to people being able to kill your CAMP-bound pets 
---
If this was IRL i would contest something i knew i could not defend. Plz stop this IRL stuff lol
---
Get that additional lone wanderer, totally worth it. I find fireproof is better than increasing dr / er in endurance. You also want to push starched and class freak fully, but you have a few levels yet. 
---
You have all the relevant perks there on pistols ... you either need to rock crits or sneak, but sneak is hard with pistols. Another option is explosive pistols and the demo perk. 
---
Bethesda never thought people apologized, and threw it away altogether.
---
Now that they know we want it, I bet it'll be on the atom shop.
---
Do it when the server population is low. Make time in the morning. Or just wait for the hype to fall off. Either way best of luck 
---
U can go on the market sub and ask someone to craft it for u...just offer a few caps and all the mats 
---
You can find cranberry moonshine in various locations in the game. It is not locked behind biv. It has always been in the game, you just have to find it. 
---
Just add someone to your team for the fight then leave team once the fight is over. 
---
I think you can still do this in the .ini file on PC. I haven't bothered but I don't see why it wouldn't work. They should have sliders in the menu though.
---
Thank you. I just had to find a way to express my deep feelings on this addition 
---
What? All my responses are to a specific comment within the post. Wether they take a turn to another subject, I agree they do. 
---
*snaps with both hands*
---
In my original comment that made this thread i was talking about a song from new vegas from as recent as 2003 and other songs, like lone star and lets ride into the sunset together from 1998. In this case, time doesn‚Äôt matter much and it‚Äôs more the case they just fit the game well. But, although wouldn‚Äôt it be nice is older than these songs the problem is that it was implemented into a game in which it didn‚Äôt fit the country aesthetic.
---
Dude, that‚Äôs not a nipple...

---
I understand if you don't like stealth gameplay, but splitting a build based on ranged combat with tankiness is suboptimal. And splitting your VATS effectiveness between base damage (maxed out gunslinger perks) and avoiding potential vats bonuses (critical savvy) is also suboptimal.
---
Pistols are great for vats, great for stealth, and terrible for building an "off-tank" character. I got rid of some of your character's redundant tankiness and swapped in stealth and vats perks. This is pretty close to the build I use (except I use both pistols and melee) and I can confirm that it's real good late game, with one caveat:
---
You need a decent legendary VATS specialized pistol to really get a vats build rolling. I have a 10mm with extra vats crit damage, extra vats crit bar growth, and double shot. I can crit every other shot with this method, and also have a 2 shot black powder pistol / explosive western revolver I can swap into for those crits. A crit with one of these weapons on a sneak attack kills most enemies in a single attack. A silenced weapon + gun fu will let you clear out droves of weaker enemies making your vats build very ammo efficient.
---
But basically long story short mixing pistols and tanking is like oil and water, they don't synergize with eachother at all.
---
Fighting sbq be a minute 
---
No worries 
---
That's the reason I never take Dogmeat anywhere. I can't listen to him cry when he gets hurt.
---
HA
---
If your constantly selling you‚Äôll be able to get 9999999 caps ( at this point it‚Äôs already breaking game code ) and yes scarcity of content played a big deal to the game but not the the vendor cap system since the vendor allocated items from vendors and let‚Äôs say a server could only allocate certain items on the world by default less items means more stability 
---
Yeah, it was really intense and touching. There are many dark quests in Fallout games, but this one takes the cake. It is the only Fallout questline that left me actually depressed and I had to walk away from the computer for a few minutes. Since the beginning I knew they all died but that didn't save me from the emotional effects of HOW they died...
---
Usually thumbs up or heart emote will tell the same thing for me.so I use those instead. What we need is a sorry emote.
---
Unfortunately, no! I haven't found any clean ones anywhere.
---
You need to change the display resolution. My boyfriend‚Äôs TV did this as well until we changed the aspect ratio to ‚ÄúScan‚Äù and then it worked perfectly 
---
I'm only in the 60s, but I really enjoy popping into lower level events where new players are (collision course and such) and helping em out (I mostly just observe and step in if they get in trouble, then drop a bunch of stim packs and stuff I have like duplicate plans. 
---
Though I will say much amusement comes from trying to get them to notice paper bags I drop.  I wish you could tag something in a very localized area with a little marker. 
---
Remember when people were posting "the game will be good in a year or give it a few months etc.?" and were getting downvoted? I member.  
---
Come on boys we gotta keep it at 666 upvotes
---
Re stack the dominos and do it again.  
---
The dragons in Skyrim would do the same thing. 
---
LIBERTY PRIME IS DISPLEASED
---
Whitesprings 
---
I had a high lvl 153 help me out on uranium fever and drop me a bunch of legendaries afterwards. 
---
Then he disconnected and his junk and power armour with ultracite pieces were left behind.... I grabbed the stuff and tried for 2 days to message him and such.... No luck. 
---
Feels bad man.
---
Cheers bro üçª lol didn‚Äôt mean to get so pist but jeez just spent the last 15-20min doing it üòí yeah I‚Äôll wait the hype dies
---
Bethesda needs to add a song a day until the playlist has every good oldies song
---
It‚Äôs way better than launch. It has its days when it wants to.  
---
Same /xbox user
---
It's getting better and better
---
I never really had issues but from what i hear from others the game is quite stable now. The real question is what do you enjoy the most about fallout?
---
I'm wondering if it's server specific or what because either it's sporadic or it's only been on some of the servers I've been on. Yeah I noticed the Watoga bots dropping dead again. I thought it was a sniper getting them till about the fifth one died before the door even opened.
---
What is the RIGHT LEG paint?  The blue and white one.  And where can I get it?  
---
destroyer of worlds
---
Got dc from server hoping you now
---
I couldn't complete the crit hit from Biv  yesterday. Multiple wines consumed, multiple crit kills in vats.
---
Never would register, I finally gave up.
---
Yup - that second ini file hiding in /Documents/ - \[shakes fist at the sky\].
---
Just exploring, shooting and collecting loot (even if its in a slow pace).
---
I think it‚Äôs them testing the principals behind displaying stash items in your camp, notice it even says ‚Äúselect items to display in your camp‚Äù in the hi for the fermenter 
---
So do not remove this!  Please just fix it!
---
Oh, I was wondering if they got Bender‚Äôs voice actor to play Biv. Too similar.
---
Do you have G-sync?
---
The Hot Rod Paint
---
But the real question is can you milk him?
---
Would be perfect if the sink actually cured diseases too.
---
Qhile it's looking less and less likely maybe the pioneer backpack will have several different mods that could add functions like this a cooking station or weapons repair station. Regardless i love this idea.
---
Lol. Yeah. Sorry to freeload. I do my part in dropping nukes on Whitespring when I'm with friends and therefore can re-join the server, but not dropping on the queen until I see she works &gt;50% of the time. 
---
&gt;Luckily this time I still had the code pieces from this week so I only had to get the key card.  
---
Just an FYI, you never need to code pieces at all if you're getting the solution from nukacrypt or another online source. Simply knowing the code is enough, you don't need to have all 8 fragments to 'prove' it. 
---
Then i say yes absolutely that's my favorite thing to do too and I've really enjoyed doing it in 76.
---
I agree. I don‚Äôt know why people want to bring realism into a game that at is very core could never happen. They will spout off about how the guns should have realism while ignoring the fact a lot of the iconic guns are not real, or the animals, or the mobs. 
---
You need walls behind it with tags like  ‚Äústand here for silo matchmaking‚Äù. Another with all the workbenches, ‚Äúwait here for queen matchmaking‚Äù etc 
---
Just bought it! 
---
Scrounge until you can fix your gear. Have some spare steel. Go to Fort Defiance and trigger Line In the Sand. The AA cannon will help you take out 3 scorchbeasts if you keep it repaired under a seige of scorched.
---
As a level 42 player I sometimes need help. Most of the time the  high level players join my team.  
---
At one point in the game ( I was level 30) I returned from a quest , I was thirsty and hungry as hell... A high level player came out of my camp and gave me the thumbs up and ran away... When I entered my camp ,all of my corn , nutfruit and tato‚Äôs were gone ,,,, I was disappointed the player looted my camp...  It was only 1 hour later I saw a bag on the floor.... I looked inside and there were 36 stimpacks in it.... I was not angry anymore...  
---
I also find it satisfying to help out the low levels , at first they look confused you pop up to help them . 
---
I just found them at the Sutton Station vendor! Cheap, too: with Hard Bargain 3 and nothing else, they were less than 300 caps.
---
Oh come on, those excuses? Nonanimated quantities of items are simply data, a bigger value before an item code and chance is that people would buy items they need anyways..
---
The more recent updates raised the storage capacity while also raising the games stability... doesn't that pretty much debunk this myth allready?
---
Follow the road  from whitesprings to top of the world,  go past the trainyard and you'll encounter a sentrybot  
---
Yes it was an attempt at a joke, (dunno how it could be taken any other way given the absurd number of steps required to turn pacifist off!)... or more a dig at bethesda for not having the foresight to make the pacifist mode easily accessible... 
---
Try Morrowind. It's the OG one that put Bethesda on the map.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/azptel/locations_of_commonly_needed_materials_will_be/?st=JTD5NZWN&amp;sh=9a9e01b9 
---
It is an incomplete list that I am slowly working on over time. But it has a few commonly needed materials and where they are. 
---
No idea. But I still have the ones I found back in beta.  
---
Lots of places: 
---
1. I usually find them at one of the east gates of Whitespring (toward the train station). 
---
2. There's more at Whitespring's main building entrance. 
---
3. From Whitespring, follow the rail tracks North to the 98 NAR Regional and you'll find a sentry bot with a few gutsys. 
---
4. The last reliable spawn that comes to mind is in the middle of nuclear silos. 
---
Good hunting and enjoy. 
---
You on pc? I‚Äôd love to get some plans (;
---
I want to find the ones that‚Äôll give me fusion cores when I kill them whitesprings don‚Äôt drop any 
---
Get a higher level and try it again,  scorchbeast don't have decent drops anyways
---
Buy it and take your time with the first play through. Read all the notes and terminals. Listen to all the holotapes. Explore. The game has so much personality. People just don't have the patience for it and shit on it for how unstable it was. Stability has improved quite a bit and the new content is free
---
Theres one on a roof by a downed vertigo, one on the roof near the high school, one on the ground and another somewhere else. Cant recall. 
---
Uranium fever? I was doing that and disconnected by mistake too lost some stuff but I‚Äôm not level 153
---
Nah, it was One noisy night or whatever, at the sons of Dane joint.
---
I've been everywhere man
---
Make sure it's highlighted with a little square next to it or it won't, depending on the system there is a button you press to activate something for fermenting, also fermantable drinks have a durability bar on them, example, you can't make beer vintage after fermentation.
---
Got it. That was going to be my next question. I actually had noticed that fermentable beer turns into beer, and I was wondering why I would do that if there's so much beer around already. 
---
The keycards always spawn, and that's good because you can take the keycards from one server to another. Just don't use the keycard if the secret entrance is already open, or you'll lose them and have to get two more. You also lose them without result if you use them out of order (use #1, then #2).   
---
There are lots of problems with this quest, but the keycards spawning too often aren't part of the problem. You may have to server hop at the secret entrance, and again at the dome at the end. 
---
Build a safe room with fast travel mat inside. Run to it the moment someone enters the workshop. That forces them to destroy the walls before they can get to you. Have multiple exits so you do not walk out in front of them. When you seek revenge, fast travel to the safe room instead of running back in. Most people I fight run back from the default workshop spawn. They usually die before putting up any meaningful defense.
---
what's your IGN?
---
My experience has been that it always has been a problem. If you're fighting multiple things, you can't see where everything gets tossed. 
---
You know I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die 
---
Yeah get those for excavator and run around overweight. I like ultra light marine armor too for the ap increase. There's a bug (still) where if you login with excavator you get an extra 100 carry weight. My character has weight perk cards and still is always overweight because I'm carrying so much shet. The excavator will let you fast travel at least. Ragstag meat, str help if you need even more.
---
I shall find this place. And murder any who kill the cats
---
Scorchbeast doesn't reward you much anyway. Maybe some crafting component, some scorchbeast meat, some aid, some crap armour piece.
---
The only reward is the satisfaction of ridding the world of one more of these bastards. Until another one spawns from the same fissure 3 minutes later.
---
Ya im gonna try to do that quest and get a few of them so I can finally see what they look like in action lol
---
It is playable. There are still frustrations with bugs and crashes, but the exploration element is lots of fun. It's a huge and interesting world, and it's great to play with friends. 
---
Yeah that seems to be the way. As I had no idea I would have to check the dome before going through all those steps. Only thing I‚Äôm thinking now is, let‚Äôs say you check dome 7 before you start; there‚Äôs literally no heads up or warning, that someone else has claimed the skin while your going through all those steps. You‚Äôll only know once you go back to the dome üò£ still stupidly aggravating. I‚Äôll just have to try back in a few months
---
Where?
---
Also are you able to hop servers with the cards? On the YouTube they said you can‚Äôt or it‚Äôll reset out of your inventory.
---
It depends on how soon you loot a container after the previous time. Lootable containers only give you loot every 20-24 hours.
---
I will do it for 150.
---
My pleasure sir...always keep my word.  Ow I need someone to sell me a explosive gauss or shotgun...
---
I am online now..PS4 
---
This right here is a step in right direction, even tho the new survival mode aint the best way they could have implemented it. 
---
I always find ants in Fort Defiance
---
The combination of that and not being able to do dailies made my decision to have a break from the game much easier.
---
Are you trolling? How can you call F76 an improvement? It has worse textures, shadows, overall performance etc. than FO4.
---
Pretty sure one spawns in clarksburg, near a safe in one o the buildings (I think the building with the basement). Sorry my description is super vague, but I picked one up there not too long ago 
---
That is asinine overkill on your strength. I‚Äôm a melee player and I have 9 on my strength 
---
The real grind those atom challenges not the caps 76000 hours for 40 atoms ...
---
Checking the dome doesn't help. On the server I got the keys, someone already raided the dome. 
---
Check the secret entrance before you get the code. That does help, because the biggest frustration is getting the keys, since that requires paying for fast travel. 
---
Once you have the dome 7 keys, you can just server hop at the dome until you get the plans. Unlike the keys there's no fast travel required. I server hopped for a half-hour last night until I got it. 
---
Camp with swimming pool an cocktail area?  
---
Aztec  Pyramid  
---
Escher House with just 1 stair 
---
Okkkkk thanks for that info bro üëçüèæ
---
You can head back to flatwoods to get a bunch of easy scrap. Lead and steel are available, as well as stimpacks. 
---
There's a nearby military base where you can get ballistic fiber.  
---
Would suggest that you get the perk that allows you to repair weapons to 200% durability. Armor too. 
---
Also, don't waste ballistic fiber on repairing non-legendary armor. Make new armor. 
---
I just got 3000
---
I kept the cards when I changed servers. I needed a new 6-digit code, but the cards stayed. 
---
I fully agree! Maybe we could have Dogmeats great, great, great, great, great, great grandpupper! 
---
Gt?
---
[98 NAR Regional](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/98_NAR_Regional). There's always a Sentry Bot.
---
Always has been in my opinion üëç
---
&gt;I‚Äôve never in my life paid real money for an in game purchase but I would pay real money for a pet, and more if it was a companion. They have to be unkillable but I‚Äôm totally okay if as a companion they don‚Äôt actually contribute to the fighting at all.
---
That sounds great, but first they have to fix the lag in busy areas, and fix VATS so it doesn't target friendlies. Imagine the stuttering in an SBQ fight with 10+ additional creatures running around, and 10 more friendly things for VATS to lock onto instead of that motherfucking scorched cricket that's nibbling on your power armor. 
---
Makes sense, good info 
---
Thank you! 
---
Buy it. 
---
I found one yesterday in the ranger station in the cranberry bog.
---
Wow thank you. I still plan on nuking white springs so this is good to know
---
Couldn‚Äôt you go to recent player tab or whatever, then just join session ? 
---
I'll pay 50 caps to put it on power armour. 75 caps if you bring a friend. A even 100 for a full squad. 
---
If you were out of ammo, meds, and with broken gear after clearing the silo, I highly doubt you would‚Äôve been ready for the nuked zone Still, the feeling does suck.
---
Could be like a Battle Royale mode if you could get the whole server involved, everyone starts at a mutual spot to drink, then whoever gets to their camp first gets a reward. Maybe something like that would be possible with private servers, and of course youd have to have pvp restrictions turned off so you could stop anyone from making it home.
---
I'm not sure. I beleuve the recent player tab shows the active lobby your in. Also rarely look at other players in the lobby as we play as a team of 2 to 4 and worry not with other people. 
---
I really wish they would let us have non-human companions 
---
ESO is definitely a great experience, but... no. 
---
No its good how it is. 
---
Set your task manager to always be on top for future program freezes.
---
No it‚Äôs really not 
---
There's a wrecked train south of Top of the World. On the east end of that wreck there's generally one. 
---
Just going from memory. I think these directions are right. 
---
Also quite a few mister gutsy bots around, and they can be tough. 
---
I did it already. Thanks anyways
---
I like the fact that it‚Äôs back to back quest completions with some expected rewards (stimpacks, water, and a low level plan). What I don‚Äôt like is having to FIND the attackers who are busy eating a bathtub or scratching at a wall inside of a building. I prefer a more ‚Äúcome at me bro‚Äù style, not hunting every nook and cranny (sometimes 4x) for a cabinet-hungry rad rat.
---
If you are looking for Sentry Bots for picking up his Fusion Core, at Welch (Ash Heap) you can find some Sentry Bots and  Assaultrons destroyed with loot.
---
Where did you see him/her?
---
I haven‚Äôt crashed once since I started playing again. I haven‚Äôt encountered any notable bugs either.
---
Xbox?
---
Whitespring Golf Course? No, Whitespring Dog Park!
---
I have dozens of alcohol in my stash.  Nearly 100.  And I can still ferment.
---
Every alcohol is listed but you can toggle each one on/off individually.  Up to the 10 total that can be fermenting.  
---
You can select manually what alcohol you want to ferment. I have more than 12 alcohols and I can still ferment what ever I want.
---
There is a wrecked Sentry Bot outside RobCo that gives me one every day
---
Think of the children before you post horrific things like this 
---
Someone found a few in a datamine during the last patch.  So they're coming.  Save those atoms ;)
---
Well I want to actually experience the fight. But with my luck it‚Äôs apparently impossible without running into a crash or glitch
---
We have been in the nuke zone a few times a week since we started playing. Killed the queen, etc. Its mainly the bugs that happen in the bunker that cause us to use so many mats. My girl gets a bug where her fired weapons do no damage to enemies inside the bunker(she has some serious kitted lv50 legendary weapons), and I keep running into gutsy that wont take melee damage for several hits then just disappear glitched into a wall or some other object. As for meds, I dont keep a ton of stimpacks. I run a heavy shotgun/melee based build and tend to take very little damage. Except from the nose immortal gutsys. Armor well its power armor and anytime I end up surrounded by bots like at Dyer or the silo they always seem to focus on one of my leg pieces. 
---
The whole silo process was just buggy af
---
Fo76 main page/home page, top right corner drop down, change user flair.
---
Where? 
---
Would be cool if they implemented a way to feed the canned dog food to animals
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
I don‚Äôt even see an incentive to play this game anymore. I run into a game breaking bug every other game
---
Look for the Quantum Nuka paint posts.   That‚Äôs the ticket. 
---
Its meant for excavating, not looking cool lol
---
Ok, will do. Thank you!
---
What really needs paint is ultracite
---
thanks man, yeah i hope the pioneer backpack will have a cool mechanic!
---
I meant that since the silo costed you so many valuable resources, you likely wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do a whole lot in the nuked zone, especially if you targeted Whitesprings or Fissure Site Prime.
---
First one is in Nuka cola plant enter straight until the atlas man and enter the bathroom with the locked door and in the right bathroom behind the door you ‚Äòlol find the first one. Second one is in tanagra town Roof on the top in the destroyed house 
---
It‚Äôs not actually broken. This user just doesn‚Äôt understand something or is not realizing the proper key/button to select the fermentation process. 
---
Before the release, someone supposedly from Bethesda said dogs (or companions of some sort) will be added to the game later.
---
Crossing the Mire listening to the one blues song on the radio, with my dog and shotgun preacher outfit, would be worth the 60
---
Dude, you are a life saver! Thank you so much!
---
I'll try to hit u up if there's a round 2.

Dataminers have found some skins for the Excavator Power Armor (they are for the Atomic Shop tho): [https://imgur.com/a/8VDV0ai](https://imgur.com/a/8VDV0ai)

There‚Äôs going to be a few rounds so feel free to join whenever!

I agree. Just be nice with some diversity

I have 2 cats.  Mom fosters 21 thru StrayLoveFoundation.org
---
Most are bombays (solid black) or tuxedo (black/white)  and 5 special needs cats.
---
3 born with CH (cerebellar hyperplasia) it's sorta like cerebral palsy.  One with a broken foot healed wrong and one with a broken leg healed wrong.   Nobody knows how the cats broke their foot or leg. But it's healed. And they move just fine 
---
2 of the CH was rescued from a vet.   Some cruel person tried to have the kittens put to sleep. They didn't stay. So when they left, the veterinarian called mom and she went to get them.   They're now 4 or 5 years old. Freddie and Flossie, named after the Bobbsie Twins ( a book mom used to read years ago)

That‚Äôs what I like to hear üëÇ

Don‚Äôt waste your time with Scorchbeasts. They‚Äôre extremely high risk for basically zero reward, especially at your level. 
---
We have separate power armor and armor and weapons for the nuke zones thankfully. Tse weapons and super strong mele stuff. 
---
We took a lot of AA and trouble shooter stuff with us in the silo. It's more so the b.s.  that was that whole experience. 
---
A late reply but thanks for the tip for using Science perk to reduce costs. I didn't believe you but finally got around to trying it last night. It really works!
---
If your looking for fusion cores take over the Poseidon workshop, top of the ash heap, it has a fusion core maker, just power it up with a fusion core generator and defend, makes about 8 cores an hour
---
It's the swimming suit. 
---
And uh, well. I would but every time I do it just un activates itself lol. 
---
It goes through no problemo. Thank you!
---
Doesn‚Äôt show on the stats of the armor itself.  Check you character stats though.  
---
I have one. I won't be home for 6 hours approximately though. 
---
Best thing for this is to have the perception perk that makes a noise when you a near a magazine since it's pretty random as far as when and where you get holotapes. after a while you'll know tons of places to check. That being said, took me a while to get most of them, and even then I just had a lucky day and found 3 rare ones in a day.
---
I have a mic, so I drop stuff, make the "come here" emote and then promise I'm just giving them stuff and I wont hurt them. Sometimes they still run away, but most of the time they trust me. Maybe cause I'm a chick they think I'm less likely to be a trap lol. 
---
That's what I mean, it does not show up anywhere.
---
RAIDERS DESTROY THINGS. Who are you to dictate what RPing a raider should be like.
---
Do npcs have explosive weapons and perks to do as much damage to camps as possible in short time? Last I checked a 68 super mutant could take 5 minutes to take down a wall.
---
I‚Äôve seen them in Watoga station. They‚Äôre VERY expensive, like 8999 caps
---
It's almost like those are irrelevant things when playing games
---
Armed and Ready for Round 1!

There's a pupper at the top of the cliffs near Harper's ferry. Once you fast travel in, turn around and go to the end of the bridge, and veer right and follow the planks up the mountainside.
---
He's unchained, but stays close watching over Harper's next to two skeletons and a dog bowl. :/
---
World full will be with you ASAP 
---
They can show the event time on the event name?
---
This is great but usually (at least in my experience) high level players will just attack lower level players and take their stuff.
---
That should fix it right?

Not new.  But don‚Äôt have a purpose yet.  There is a scorched ashes spawn in the Helvetia church.  Has been there forever.
---
Some theorized it was related to a responders side quest that was unfinished or removed. 
---
Ok dude. We had to switch silos anyway as the pipes weren‚Äôt repairing 
---
Are you putting them in your stash first ? because when I try to add them directly to the fermenter it gives me a "Too many items" warning and won't let me add them
---
Little delay.. had to switch silos the pipes weren‚Äôt repairing 
---
good to hear!
---
Is this like the hatch in Lost? Where you have to enter the same code phrase every day to stop the world from ending? Just out of curiosity, were you at all tempted to search "is the game worth buying now?".. [seriously](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fo76+reddit+is+the+game+worth+buying+yet)
---
That‚Äôs too bad. It would be hilarious to run around spitting at people.
---
Exactly what I want to see done. Give us a list of active events and their timers would be perfect 
---
along the wrecked trucks on the road between RobCo and General Steak House
---
Chameleon. 
---
I'm wondering what is causing the critical hit issue for so many. It registered for me just fine on PS4. I've been able to complete a daily from him every day day so far except one day when it crashed right as I was starting one and glitched so I couldn't reactivate it. 
---
But for the critical I just used vats hits until my critical meter was full and then hit triangle to perform a critical hit and it registered.
---
Haha my bad I was not tempted. Btw 4 8 15 16 23 42
---
No.  I can add them directly to the fermenter.  
---
Make sure your stash is not full.  Since it is your stash you have to have room for the alcohol you add to the fermenter. 
---
Not the mutation right? Just the legendary armor pieces 
---
If standing, it's possible they were using a stealth boy.
---
There are legendary perks you can get on some armours called 'chameleon'. When the player crouches / activates sneak they will become invisible until they stand up again.
---
Hah, great response! Upvote!
---
I honestly just want Biv as a companion. He doesn't need to fight or anything... I just want a "drunk" robot saying funny, stupid stuff following me around all the time telling me we're best friends. 
---
Are you referring to the stats screen when inspecting it being blank??
---
Lol well either way if it‚Äôs in a workshop you are fair game
---
I have no experience with the mutation so I can't answer that, sorry.
---
Damn. Thanks for the info though!
---
Crouching, chameleon armour. Standing, armourless with chameleon mutation, or chameleon mutation in weightless effect armour.
---
I thought i'd just say that, wow didn't reach its peak until its 3rd expansion. so even the most popular games, didn't start off with max players, it grew into something a lot of ppl wanted to play. it took years to become that game it didn't happen in the first and second or third year. 
---
Okay that‚Äôs what I was wondering. I‚Äôve had a chameleon armor piece before and I don‚Äôt recall that ever happening but thanks for letting me know. Sure does clear it up 
---
Dude hooked me up with a marsupial, speed demon, and other serums and tons of bulk. Couldnt believe it. 
---
The hotfix wasn't fixing that regardless
---
Forever in queue haha.
---
Alright no problem. Thanks anyways 
---
If you're just looking for fusion cores hit up Watoga, there's like 4. You might have to server hop.
---
Got it. Thank you!
---
Start a new build maybe, something opposite to the one you run now.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt exactly fix it. It could show 20 minutes left but that doesn‚Äôt mean the players are 5 seconds away from completing the final objective. Unless i completely misunderstand how events work
---
Vintage Nukashine for the 300% more damage!
---
430 hours in what u think 
---
A timer and then another means of gauging the completeness of the objective. I've traveled to events that had plenty of time left but other players complete it or enemies kill the objective before we can get there sometimes. So we need two pieces of critical information I feel.
---
The plan is just called Signs and Letters, or maybe the reverse, it doesn't mention neon at all but the BoS Watoga vendor in the super duper mart IS the robot your looking for.
---
Right? ‚ÄòCause anyone that hungover would not want to use a map. You got to unfold it, then figure out where you are, then where your going, then fold it back up? F that. *crumples map into ball, throws over shoulder*
---
gin_kaiju on PS4. I don't have any TSE's. I'm just looking to buy a Gauss. Have you got anything? Thanks
---
If not at a shop, they can be a random reward for defending workshops. My friend went on a workshop claiming-and-defending spree until she got them.
---
She's been playing since the beta and just got them a week ago. So. The odds are like THAT.
---
Gatling Laser (both regular and Ultracite) and Gatling Plasma weapons are also good candidates for Priming, since one Flux and one Ultracite gives you an overcharged Ultracite Core, and you can convert (and recharge) existing cores rather than being stuck with farming it from scratch. A 120% Ultracite Fusion Core is good for up to 1200 shots on a Gatling Laser with Power User 3.
---
Blight soup, anything with crit damage really.
---
If you are in a team with them no. If other players in the blast radius aren't on your team it will trigger pvp.
---
I'm level 16 and would love this plan. I just got myself a nice handmade that needs mods
---
Ahh, that‚Äôs what the pip is indicating in the fermenter UI, that makes sense. I haven‚Äôt made it up to 10 yet, but I noticed some had that indicator. 
---
According to a recent datamining there seems a clean scientist/doctors suit is coming to the Atom shop soon, so most likely they don't exist in-game. Save up some atoms with daily and weekly challenges and you should have one soon though.
---
If anything the arc should be chance based. 
---
Best current tactic to the Tesla?  Long distance and a well placed shot to the head. 
---
If the game crashes completely, instead of just dropping you from the server, then the Recent tab will be empty on reload. Though, in the Xbox home screen, you can view a list of people you recently "met" and you can potentially join off of them, but it's not as reliable.
---
I don't think so. But from my experience using that perk it seemed that I was going into "last stand" a lot less and instead immediately dying and dropping a grenade. Maybe is a better solo perk? Needs further research as I had the empath perk which significantly reduced the amount of times I entered last stand. 
---
Rad resist is bugged. It works on some armor pieces and not others. If it shows up on the armor's sheet stats, it's working. If it doesn't it's broken and does nothing. Currently there's no way to make a broken piece work or a working piece break so it's all down to luck when it drops.
---
No, you're thinking of TNT Dome 3, which has. T-51b Nuka paint. We could also get TNT Dome 2's key for the Alien Blaster goodies.
---
Now we can open TNT Dome 7, which has X-01 Quantum Paint, and it involves a tottally different hidden quest.
---
The Tanagra town keypad is related to the Enclave Bunker now and let's you get the plans for Shielded Enclave Underarmor for free.
---
And you can now get other paints from turning in Technical Data for the BOS. I've seen Knight and Paladin paint, with whispers of the others, like Knight Sergeant, etc.
---
Ahhh that one. I think they fixed the timing now, because previously those two weren't supposed to be available until the wardens accidentally attacked you while you were wandering around the toxic valley. I started a new character after the patch and neither one shows at the correctional facility.
---
I remember on my other toons though, jesus christ. The first time I found it was at level 20 on my first character, chasing a feral ghoul horde. The horde was there. The mutants were there. Everything was level 35ish because of a higher level guy that was there that left. By the time it was done I was at 10% hp, healing with food and water, and was ridiculously overencumbered lol
---
Ya, the UI is the new feature that they are going to be using for the Display features coming, which is why it says "Select items to display".  You can select any time from your stash on/off to ferment.  Fermenter has a special filter that only allows it to show Alcohol in the Aid category.
---
Adding items directly to your Fermenter just puts them in your stash and sets them to Ferment right away.  Taking them out of your Stash removed them from the Fermenter, etc.
---
‚Äú...I had to nope right the hell out of there.‚Äù
---
I love this, may I borrow it?
---
That would be a unique concept. 
---
hrmm weird I just tried it again and now it seems to be working odd
---
I am kind of curious, does anyone ever use legendary wood armor?
---
2 cranberries, 3 snaptail reeds, water and wood
---
NOT TO MENTION the mutants killed my damned legendary ghouls before I could even tap it.
---
Daily Repost no need to upvote https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1i8rx/bethesda_we_need_event_timers/
---
Please do! Lol. :)
---
Cause your Stash is lower weight, probably.  Now you have enough room to put the drinks in.
---
[Something like this may work better for you.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5ff&amp;d=s01sg2p02pb2eh2c72cu2ic4a72ad2ak2an2ao0al0a00lv2lt2lk2l12l71lu0&amp;w=&amp;n=6375)
---
Toy around with different pistols to check their AP costs in vats. You'll likely want pipe or 10mm pistols as their AP costs seem lowest. Also get a suppressor. Reengage sneak with escape artist as often as possible. The stacked bonuses from sneak attacks and head shots will multiple your damage output by x5.
---
Just wondering what is the fastest way of splitting ammo and giving it to friends? Today I had 1400 .38 and was going to give 400 to a lvl 16 but sliding the bar from 1400 to 400 took so long i stopped at 700 and gave them to him.
---
It doesn't affect downed rates. However you drop the nade as soon as you're downed not when you die so it's entirely possible and probable to get downed, drop a nade, get stim packed by another player, and stand up just in time to get killed by your own explosive.
---
Nice to hear. 
---
I got into Fallout when 4 was released. Played 100+ hours and really really enjoyed the exploration. Story was kinda "meh" but I didn't bother with it cuz the world was so beautiful and rich. 
---
Just bought F76 and having a blast. 
---
Gonna try F3 and NV eventually. 
---
I think I agree. I did the ‚Äúleader of the pack‚Äù mission the other day and it‚Äôs actually a great mission, 3 packs of wolves each is lead by a bigger legendary, so you get a 1, 2, and 3 star legendary.  But it‚Äôs leveled at level 5(?) so all the rewards where worthless 
---
Side question, why don‚Äôt the ‚Äúthe horde‚Äù missions work like that, it‚Äôs the correct mechanic for that type of mission? 
---
And one of the top things on their official ‚ÄúTo-do‚Äù list that just keeps getting posted 
---
Raiders for Rippers. Check out the two venders around top o world
---
Not fun fact: Veterinarians have a suicide rate 3 times higher than the average. The rate is also sky high for men working in low-pay manual labor, women in police departments, and transgender people in general.
---
Yes a well placed shot to the head but is that realistic? We are afterall talking about fights that go on til someone gives up. Most times theyre stealthboyed jumping and weaving all the way to you because stealth is nerfed and they can see you on the compass.
---
Yeah, but the same can be said of explosive weapons. Someone killed me the other day in power armor just shooting at my feet. He definitely didn't hit me directly. Also, it doesn't really have any aoe except for the lobber barrel. It only hits with the arcs. Did you mean that the arcs should only target pve?
---
Not sure but the tool tip on the load screens says it only works when unarmored.
---
Bethesda: base price for the letters is 12000 caps, might do better with perks and charisma items...
---
Me: oh. (Pause) How much for just ‚ÄúF‚Äù and ‚ÄúU‚Äù then?
---
Hope you manage to get in lol
---
It‚Äôs a counter. Checks and balances. 
---
You post on reddit and say "hey let's start a faction." Then you live stream it too. Players more interesting than NPCs, welcome to 2019.
---
&gt;Maybe instead of making the spawn rate so low just make them more expensive
---
I think that's what the plan should be for.  An expensive thing that costs to make.  So really they should just add plans.
---
Leave the mods as rare and relatively cheap.  Put the plans for those willing to spend caps and supplies.
---
And All Rise is my Repel.
---
This is a anti mod thing in the game. It‚Äôs because you have illegal mods 
---
Jetpacks aren't rare. Unless you are picky about it and want an x01 jetpack. Watoga sells several plans. Sure they are 5000 caps but available.
---
Can you ferment any alcohol until it becomes ‚Äúvintage‚Äù or is there only certain types? 
---
If you had read the thread on this you'd know this happens because someone else was there first. It took me 5 tries to get the keys, and then about THIRTY hops before I got the plans. You just have to be patient. 
---
There list 3 bridges in flat woods 
---
Did they finally bring the fast travel mats back? Last I looked into then they removed them in the BETA test. So I don't think they even have them to do that.
---
I'm not even into melee yet and this is a great idea! Makes way more sense than being told you're not using any ammunition to swing (cuz...obviously!)
---
It no longer affects reload speed. Tested on several servers with a couple of people, the amount of time it takes to reload a gun is always the same, with or without Speed Demon.
---
Only specific alcohols have vintage versions.  So far I only know the Nukashine you start with.  I learned the "Lead Champagne Bellini" recipe yesterday, and that requires "Vintage Lead Champagne" to make, but I haven't learned the Lead Champagne recipe, so I cannot make it to allow it to ferment to Vintage.
---
No, it's assumed currently that it will continue once we get more content.
---
The building is called the Vailt-Tec Agriculteral Research Center. It's to the east of Flatwoods across a bridge. You're required to go there for the Fertile Soil event, so it's possible you were there already. The overseer's tape is in a blue container on the counter right in front of you as you walk in
---
Ugh okay so we've got 1 counter which can be countered back easilly, what else do you have in mind to stop this weapon that lands entire magazines with precision?
---
I actually assumed they were talking about X01... just cause that's what everyone hops for these days.
---
It's an incompatibility with your custom ini and mods.  Update and correct them to fix it.
---
Look up ur ass
---
Whitespring has been a major disappointment since the patch. The times I have been the legendary spawn rate is very low. I don‚Äôt get the need by Bethesda to throttle what little endgame is actually in the game. I wish it would go back to the original crazy spawn and drop rate. 
---
I have always had this issue.... üòë
---
It looks pretty horny. Huh. 
---
Buy them off reddit instead, people sell them from 1-3k normally if you patient ..
---
Heh, if you'd been running with me you'd found your bad filled with more goodies. I never take low level player junk bags. They need it, I don't. :)
---
Explosive damage can be negated completely, and if you read more clearly I said the AOE can stay. Direct attacks automatically landing on enemies with 0 effort is what im getting at here.
---
But at the price of a snacc
---
That quest is just a pain. One day soon I will conquer it though.
---
Lol, but I don't have any mods! This is a fresh install!
---
I‚Äôm not going to debate you. Come up with your own method to deal with it. 
---
Are you on now?
---
If it doesn't get fixed, please refund the caps each time it happens.
---
Just buy from a player. I bought mine for 4000 caps. Try the bazaar.
---
Just clear your .ini file of mods, or update the mods, the last update moved the world up slightly, and if you overide the loading order with a fallout76custom.ini you don‚Äôt load that change and you spawn underground.  
---
Oooh, that actually makes a lot of sense. Thanks  for clearing that up, thought I was missing something 
---
No custom ini. No mods. Fresh, clean install. 
---
Yesterday I was hopping in and out of my X01 and Excavator.  Didn't know why I was wieghing so much more (about 30 lbs).
---
Turns out my helmets on both my Power Armors were unequipped.  And stuck in my inventory.  Only finally noticed it cause I didn't get my Excavator +100 bonus.
---
So, check to make sure that 17 lbs isn't like... one random piece of your Power Armor not being equipped properly.
---
You understand the only way to do this is to change the effect for PVE too right? That's the problem with trying to blend the two genres seamlessly. One crowd wants it for what they play more of and the other wants it removed for what they play more of. If there was strictly a PVP mode with no PVE elements it could be removed there but as it sits now I dont see it happening without a complete nerf. If someone wants to be cheap and use it let them do it, just dont fight back. 
---
It's this new spoon fed Internet generation.
---
They want all the answers given back like Google.
---
Gone are the joys of going to the library and utilizing the DDS to get the information you need.
---
Jumping into power armor will negate some effects, including deep pocketed mods (since you arent wearing em), and weight reduce legendary effects.
---
It could be that, the gained weight being weight you gained back from unequipping WR gear
---
Had it today...had to face a 3 star schorched mirelurk queen after killing the heart
---
...got a one star tire irin
---
Other users report the same thing.  Seems the custom files are not removed when you uninstall/reinstall.  So you gotta hunt them down and fix them manually.
---
womp wompppppppppppp
---
I think it has to do with your non PA armour. Sometimes it unequips and with it the weight of the armour is added back. Other times you keep it equipped. My chest makes weapons weight 40% less and when in PA I can feel the difference. 
---

No but you can obtain all the Holotapes and get 80 Atoms

Why did you comment if you aren't going to debate? I want to see YOU come up with a method. I feel most commentors don't even PVP or have never run into a jumping stealthboyer that's not even deterred by his own jumping because his gun literally auto locks on you. I swear wait for the PVP server there will be a mob of people complaining about this gun.
---
Think you need to find the plan or buy a mod off a vendor. Can‚Äôt get it from scrapping 
---
Destroy enough stuff until you are under the Carry Weight + 1500 lb limit.
---
They want to force people to deleting their excessive inventories.  I doubt they'll let these characters use player vending machines when it comes around.
---
Stews provide a hearty amount of food and drink, too.
---
It'd be great if they fixed it so that endurance on equipment actually was functional before releasing content that has it. I'm a dreamer.
---
There's a direct path up the hill then a short jump to the card. I did it with no mutation or power armor.
---
I dunno. Honestly I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt want players using mules. I second the womp womp
---
You don't even have to go through the cave.  You just snake around to the path with the stairs and then make a few jumps over the rotten appliances and you're inside the house with the keycard on the ledge.
---
Yes I have a gauss for you. Pirateglenn1 ..come find me on PS4
---
I almost welcome it.  I hated my Jukebox being defaulted "ON" when I logged in.  But mostly because the Jukebox music turned out to be really bad.
---
Drop/destroy what‚Äôs not needed. See what people are looking for and whatnot. 
---
Pve'rs dont need an arc to use the weapon. Im not talking about nerfing the damage im talking about removing its auto aim. In PVP you should have to aim period unless it's vats which is a whole nother mechanic.
---
You'll have to close the stall door in the Nuka Cola factory in order to see the keycard more clearly.
---
Strength is carry weight, and melee damage
---
Also weight reduction and heavy/melee/shotgun damage perks. 
---
Overkill I think not.
---
I can‚Äôt drop anything until it‚Äôs under the max weight. It all gets destroyed. My intention was for this to be my shop which is why we collected so much. üôÑ 
---
The overseers body was never found. So she is presumably still alive atm. It kind of reminds you of a  Netflix series your really into and they leave you with a cliff hanger at the end. Pisses you off but you cant wait till the next season in 8 months. lol 
---
That's sufficient enough. Your problem is most likely the game sitting on a normal HD. If you can afford it, get a SSD. Nothing fancy, just not too small. You'll notice a definite increase in load times and it MIGHT help with the choking while textures are streamed. At the very least, it should reduce the sluggishness by a noticable margin.
---
Even when mine are turned on I can't hear anything from them. :(
---
Seriously there are like 10 ways to counter sentinel. People need to shut up. Everyone crying for nerfs. Just learn how to play

üòÇüòÇüòÇ good one.

---
&gt; You can‚Äôt start a faction
---
WTF do you think reddit is for?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?
---
Ok...then +5 and +3.  Seems to be enough.
---
I mean you still can run as a shop. What exactly are you carrying? Roughly 
---
It‚Äôs mostly plans. A shit ton of plans. Some legendary weapons
---
I love the neon letters, saved a lot of caps to get them.....but for the love of God they are the hardest to place STRAIGHT! 
---
I have my IGN on my house, only took 45 minutes to place the letters and it looks like a 5 year old wrote it.  Frustrating......
---
So I was thinking something along the lines of a gauge about the size of your food or water meters, but placed just below the status boxes that appear under your ammo quantity while you're carrying a gun. When you switch to melee, the ammo quantity can disappear and the durability gauge could over take its position. Cuz I hate the little status box which basically says "hey, if you've even noticed me, you have anywhere from 1 to 200 shots til your gun breaks" and it's frustrating to try to work with
---
Oh yeah did that already 
---
Ooh gotcha that makes sense. I know right, I thought the treads were interesting. 
---
Seems when you first turn them on it takes a while to start playing a song.  Almost like it has to wait for what ever song was queued in the "system" to play to finish, and then it starts playing when the next song plays.
---
They are also very quiet with a very short range drop off.  Somewhere in the patch notes they mentioned you could adjust radio audio separately now, I haven't bothered checking to see if I could increase it in the settings, or what level it defaults to.
---
Honestly just drop all common plans. Everyone has them by now so I doubt they'll sell in your shop.
---
Workshops are optional, nothing great about them anyway. I can play many hours without taking one.Also level doesn't matter since SPECIAL/ gear are caped at lvl 50. So saying "that level 160" isn't really saying anything.
---
Atom and Eve would maybe be a fitting song, in regards to in game events as well as timeline.
---
People that are killing the servers have over 100 of thousand of weight. Many people are where I am at. 
---
It's weird that no one said this yet: you're supposed to say "this is my PSNid, this is my schedule, let's play together and protect each other."
---
It's not griefing it's an experience to teach you the importance of teaming up. Anti-social players can't help being bullied.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean they should
---
It's like we need, "Sorry, I am a loner, a rebel" emote.  (please read that in a pee wee herman voice.)
---
Do you have any mods installed? Or is it just the game. If it's just the game, try verifying the games files by clicking "game options &gt; scan and repair" in the launcher. 
---
Adding to the rules
---
I won't lie, feel free to hate me for this: I don't feel bad for you. You, and so may others, skirted the weight restrictions this way and now have to play with the intended weight restrictions.
---
Yeah I was talking about this last night with my friend.  At the very least there should be way more abandoned campfires that we can use, but considering the camping and hiking themes it's a bummer we don't have some sort of camp stove.
---
Worst idea i ever encountered on this subreddit
---
Ohhhh... bloodied or instigating are aces on the autogrenade. And autogrenade doesn‚Äôt get prefixes at all, regardless of the legendary 
---
That makes sense, I'm just surprised I've never seen it happened since ive been playing since launch ha. 
---
I thought that might be the case initially, but it weight was added back even when the armor was still considered equipped. Still you might be onto something about legendary effects. I never thought about it before, but I do have leg piece that gives me 20% less for ammo. Things seemed fine before the patch, but it probably was glitch in the first place that kept the effect in place.
---
What platform are you on? If Xbox, I can give you some help! 
---
Imo the market is over saturated with weapons and armour. There‚Äôs still caps to be made there. But plans and the like are more wanted now. 
---
Might just be ideal to take a net loss and kill dead weight. What you destroy you‚Äôll make back quickly. 
---
Or learn all the plans and become a service instead of merchant
---
Orbital strike beacons use way too much fiber optics :( rarest material by far
---
I agree with this 100%. Only taking workshops now for any daily/weekly challenges and to experiment with CAMP building ideas, lol.
---
Yes.. I think...
---
Exactly. 400 lbs wasn‚Äôt enough. So I made a mule. They put the players in that position. They allowed the players to be in that position. So I took it like it was intended. 
---
You need to get mental help, you are obsessed with collecting junk
---
You're lucky!
---
That‚Äôs what I thought initially. 
---
You're just lazy to not post your contact info to reddit, but the word literaLEEEEE is stupid i dare you to never say it again.
---
If you were incredibly stupid you wouldn't be able to stop. It would be your favourite word salad, ever.
---
üòÇüòÇ good try. My shop has 0 junk. 
---
But people who play PVE use the arc for crowd control so yes, we do need the arc. That's the whole point of the Tesla. 
---
No mods, i can't even get to that part, the game quits before i can start anything, i've run scan and repair several times.
---
Lol i was jumping and checking when the room is locked so i can start quest from there at 3rd jump room was still open but lucky for me plan was on the table with open door
---
Loll
---
That's cool. That whole area has so much history. I love it. Hope your friend enjoyed it too! 
---
A lot of the new recipes are based on and result in normal drinks. You can make things like fermentable Pickaxe Pilsner and fermentable Nuka-Dark and they'll just age into their normal varieties.
---
Adding as optional. 
---
Plus you can only vintage the fermentable drinks, excluding beer. So finding a standard Blackwater Brew won't do anything. Make a fermentable drink, put in fermenter and eventually you get either a standard drink or vintage version.
---
I think the Scrapper Perk was buffed/fixed to work now.  So you get quite a bit from scrapping with it now.
---
You can get to around 1800lbs if you have an excavator PA with calibrated shocks. My primary runs around between 1600-1800 (1500 + 220lbs give or take). If you have strong back perks and pocketed armour, goes up slightly. So you going to have to destroy half your stuff, or empty your stash, I believe you can transfer stuff into your stash, so maybe destroy all your junk and keep the stuff you really want in your stash so not to destroy it ..
---
It's a real lame move by Bethesda dealing with dupers, while effective impacts regular players. I honestly don't know why we keep putting up with this nonsense .. real lazy move on the devs part to deal with dupers who don't play the game .. also create 4 alts and spread your stuff across all alts ..
---
Ya, I haven't been able to do any dailies since the update.  Other than BIV's Booze stuff.
---
Do you go through the tunnel, I had to kill crickets in there, near the last jump to the top area, it leads up to the house you want. To get to top floor of house no need to jump, walk up and around back of house and you are there. Only need to jump across final upper floor for card and it is a no problems jump without mutation.
---
Key had already been taken when I did it, sad, but went around to check out the place where the plan was suppose to be and the door was open, no one around, go inside and plan was sitting on table, take paint plan, happy again. I guess the plan spawn more than once after the door has been opened on the server?
---
Probably a silent  buff. I‚Äôd wager that the Scrapper perk is more effective now as a result 
---
I am going real old school here...did you restart your computer?  My father was one of the first computer programmers in the work and he had 3 tips in life: duct tape fixes everything that wd40 doesnt, when in doubt, kick it out (in reference to soccer bit ot works for everything), and if all else fails reboot. 
---
 If that doesnt work i say uninstall and reinstall.  That is my real suggestion but i always ask first if people have rebooted the computer yet.
---
The smart thing to do would be "hey reddit here is my gamer tag and schedule let's team up and protect each other!"
---
Maybe mommy Beth can protect you next patch.
---
I quite liked the juke box but needed music to give my place a nice atmosphere for my customers when they come to my place.
---
2k
---
I believe I might have the flamer mod for that. Xbox. 
---
It' was and is enough for me. I enjoy the game and have played within the restrictions. I'm glad they increased the limit, but I also think carry weight +1500 lbs is still a lot. 
---
How many are you doing today?
---
Exactly! I never duped a day in my life. I‚Äôm not smart enough or cheap enough to do that. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs honest gameplay that I can‚Äôt get access to anymore. I‚Äôm going to have to destroy common items I guess and go from there. 
---
It works well when you change the volume and I'm glad they added it.
---
She has to be still alive, listen to the holotape she leaves after you launch your first nuke. She talks about how disappointed she is that you launched one at the map. It hasn'e been confirmed but I agree, it's still open for more to come down the road.
---
Well I'm actually Jewish but our food is just so bland. Gotta spice it up every once in a while.
---
I live by those tips as well, yes, i've rebooted a few times, but nothing...
---
Stealth boy effect is more invisible. The chameleon effect requires more of it to be completely see through 
---
Alright so 400lbs wasn‚Äôt enough for a shop. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  simple. 
---
Yeah, if it gets chalanged while you're away, it should just send you a message where you have 2 min to return and defend it or you'll loose it.  I don't take workshops at all after I heard you can get shot any place any time.
---
What‚Äôs the right leg with the white and blue paint??
---
Imagine that. Looks like all you had to do all along was be social in a multiplayer game. 
---
Stunning. 
---
Go in a train station,  look for a new poster that talk about a party,  read it and you will start the moonshine quest. 
---
Do all of it,  brew a new nukashine, get naked and do the additional challenge. 
---
add xXDemolisher if you play PC i'll gladly pvp alone vs your team
---
Whinger is a Scottish word for someone who complains(whinges) all the time.
---
You're right about that, because they didn't intend for people to make pure merchants and over-burden their already potato servers
---
Do you use the targeting HUD on your power armor? My game crashed a lot in nuke zones until I removed this.
---
25 years after a nuclear war. You‚Äôd be pressed to find non mutated fruits and veggies. Maybe they will add more crafting options later. 
---
Did you double check that your character from the main menu?
---
You can sometimes lose a few minutes of work due to checkpoints/saves in game, but to roll back that far seems strange.  And given the length of time you were away makes me wonder about character and/or account changes.
---
Hey do you mind craft for me ? 
---
Will bring ingredients.
---
Xbone: piallator 
---
Well maybe you should raise your kids to stand up to bullies instead of bullying others into doing what you want, eh? Look mate, I got bullied until I was in 8th grade. I joined the football team, started getting stronger and eventually I was able to beat the dog shit out of the people who bullied me for countless years. They pushed me to better myself. If kids aren‚Äôt bullied, they are soft. Soft kids grow into soft adults like you. Soy boy
---
My boyfriend had the same issue, crit just wouldn't register so he gave up 
---
On the other hand I received a specialized request for Ballistic Bock because I was wearing the Silver Shroud costume. It was a craft and return and completed fine. So if anyone has the Silver Shroud costume go use it with Biv. 
---
I would recommend uninstalling and reinstalling then.
---
Frame rate is irrelevant when playing video games? You are trolling for sure!
---
I lost one of my favourite camps on one of my characters due to the new ‚Äúno build zone‚Äù and was kinda sad about it. 
---
My main character has his camp near your spot (at the trailer south of the lead deposit, near the cliff), now I‚Äôm worried of losing it too...lol The camp‚Äôs been fine since update though..so fingers crossed. 
---
Since so many people have been commenting about this, hopefully we can get some official replies on this issue, if there‚Äôs indeed a bug about these ‚Äúno build zones‚Äù or not. 
---
I will give a try, thanks!
---
That is awesome my friend!
---
3 rounds but I might do 4 or 5 if I have time!
---
What crowds? What about pve requires autolocking guns? Do you mean AOE? Because I don't. I mean the fact the gun auto locks. The original fallout tesla didn't even auto lock it was a beam that created an energy blast at the point of impact but it did not with no effort arc straight to the target.
---
West Tek, AWOL Armaments, WS, Uranium Fever, SBQ
---
Yeah, Power armor is supposed to unequip (‚Äúsuppress‚Äù might be more accurate) all your armor/underarmor when you are in it, so that legendary weight reduction is absolutely where your phantom weight is coming from.
---
It doesn‚Äôt always visually unequip it in your pip boy, but it should always remove the effects of your armor 
---
Natta, frames are irrelevant 
---
Yep, playtime
---
Oh yeah, nobody intended to role play in an RPG. ok üòÇ people want to be merchants just like people want to be raiders 
---
Well shit, good job man! Maybe they shouldn't have added all the new content into the map at once haha
---
Good find!
---
Ok... but that still doesn‚Äôt explain why neither of them have the ability to prevent me being seen. 
---
The stealth boy has NEVER given me invisibility to the point where an enemy can‚Äôt see me. I get noticed and engaged every single time. 
---
While it sucks when this happens as a new player, this hardly ever happens to seasoned players.
---
Whitesprings is probably the MOST nuked area.  Therefore there's always a chance of spawning into a nuke zone if you exit the game on the Whitesprings grounds. You're right,  you can't possibly know that you are going to spawn into a nuke zone, but if you treat it like you always will (because the chance is high)  you'll be alright. 
---
The are several solutions you can use as a player for this: 
---
1. Don't exit on Whitesprings
---
2. If you do exit on Whitesprings, do it in Power Armor or a Hazmat suit so when you spawn in, you're still wearing it. 
---
3. Before exiting the game,  store all your junk so you don't drop it you forget either of the first two things
---
I always have this tagged but now I‚Äôm a bit lost with it.....
---
Your perk load isn‚Äôt balanced dude, it‚Äôs just the fact. I agree with you on Charisma but you‚Äôve murdered your Intelligence (which contains perks like Power User, Makeshift Warrior, and Gunsmith), you are 100% wrong about Agility‚Äôs usefulness (AP Regen, Adrenaline) and you‚Äôre underutilizing Luck (Luck of the Draw, Lucky Break). Your current build translates to extreme damage output at the cost of weapon/armor durability and constant repair costs, high Fusion Core drain, and you‚Äôve failed to utilize the best perks in the game under Agility. I‚Äôd seriously recommend reconsidering those Strength points because they‚Äôre better utilized in other areas. 
---
The stars arent always like that, last 3 times ive done the event ive had only 1 stars for every single legendary wolf
---
Is this something that can seriously happen?
---
That's the big issue I run into also. The end-game content is really nothing but drop nukes on WhiteSpring or SBQ. Both of which become boring quickly.
---
Nice find.
---
I wonder if they'll give is a fast travel point to it directly when it releases?  Since it seems to have a Stash inside, and a party Poster outside, seems like it will be a new Train Station.
---
Put on fireproof and a dense chest piece and those tse weapons are almost useless against you.
---
Yeah, I know. Just wish they would have some type of generic naming style. Similar to unfermented Pickaxe Pilsner which yields itself from fermentation. The "moonshine" part imo is just adding to potential confusion.
---
What‚Äôs your agility at? If it‚Äôs too low the effects don‚Äôt matter.  Also weight does matter as well. 
---
The main quest continues in the fall. 
---
I‚Äôm in a new server now! 
---
See, what's fascinating to me is I'd heard the civic center "always" has a legendary. I've never seen one there. Maybe there is a literal luck element, I don't know. 
---
And that's exactly what I don't want to _have_ to do. One, because it's frustrating. If I'm buying gear from other players, I want good gear, and _good_ gear is always on a trade-only level. Two...I want to be able to get this shit organically. 
---
In 4, I've never had a playthrough where I didn't have a full set of decent legendary gear by 30 or so. Here? I think I had two crap armor pieces by 30. 
---
It has to be an alcohol that can be fermented.  "Done" stuff won't go further.
---
Some newer brews can ferment to new products.  And you can tell if it can be fermented if it has a CND bar.  That indicates how close to finishing Fermentation the item is.
---
In a new server now, another nuke dropping very soon
---
Thats what i thought i'm really happy to see the mire getting more content by far the coolest creatures on the map live there.
---
I said everything is otherwise in its place save for the missing progress, costume, and fast travel locations. I‚Äôve never created more than one character. I start the game and click play and that‚Äôs the way it is.
---
In a new world now, launch nuke in 5 mins 
---
If you place power armor on a high ledge you can get into the power armor, teleporting you up to the spot you placed it, allowing you to reach areas that are much higher than normally possible.
---
You can even marsupial jump to place armor, then jump again to get even higher than marsupial allows.
---
So, as far as enemies are concerned, each piece of Chameleon armor is just a 20%ish buff to your stealth rating. Lots of other things affect it- stealth perks, movement speed, armor weight, agility score. More chameleon pieces give more stealth bonus. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how much of a bonus the stealthboy gives, but I‚Äôve heard the Chameleon mutation gives you a 100% bonus to your stealth score (if unarmored/wearing weightless armor), basically equal to 5 chameleon pieces. 
---
1 piece is all you need in PvP though, since your stealth rating is irrelevant there 
---
that was datmined also 
---
I ran that furious until the game literally fucking ate it. I think it was the "Mama Dulce" bug, but it could have been accidentally selling it to a vendor  , or it just flat out wasn't there when I logged in one day. All of those things have happened. 
---
I am not sure it had an interior to be honest, but the sign is there. You can see it from the tattoo shop.
---
Haha. Maybe if this was new Vegas plus the nukewshine. Id understand where all my caps went.
---
Yea I tried logging out to a new server ad they are gone. Oh well, time to start over it won't take long.
---
Hey no problem :) 
---
Because you can scrap bulk. 200 plastic is chump change. 
---
I bet you'd love that. Twice as many caps per server hop.
---
Thank you! I was wondering what that was
---
You out in freshly crafted alcohol aka fermentable alcohol in it to make them ferment faster. 
---
Once it's been in long enough, it becomes the regular consumable version.
---
As far as I know, only the new spirits (not the beers) added can be further fermented into "vintage", like Nukashine, Lead Champagne, etc
---
Yup already in the world with you, thanks for the heads up!
---
I see.  Someone suggested to not use the map (you're drunk after all).
---
That will make the journey more interesting...
---
The forest challenge needs photos to be in specific areas, not just anywhere
---
&gt; coolest creatures on the map live there.
---
That VW Van Hermit Crab still freaks me out every time it suddenly pops out of the junk pile I'm walking by.
---
i want a dog so bad. even just various "cosmetic" pets that have no impact on my or others gameplay other than being there looking cute. gimme a cat, or a bird, or something. i'll pay all the atoms or caps for a companion pet.
---
Personally I don't mind razorgrain instead of barley. Beer can be brewed from different grains and razorgrain is just a fancy new grain that nuclear war gave us!
---
I wouldn't mind hops being added to replace corn in the recipe though.
---
it's under the wall decorations tab. You build it in your camp, and then you just activate it like a note.
---
I had one of these guys at thunder mountain, just sitting on a generator 
---
I hit him with a shotgun, when I didn‚Äôt get a reaction I watch him for a while and left feeling quite sad
---
I agree?
---
You'll find it under "wall decor" I believe. Just throw it up on a wall, and then "read" it.
---
Alternatively, you can just find one at any train station and read it to start the quest.
---
Umm friend, those are bulls, not cows. I get they like you and all the to greet you when you approach l ok l
---
I think there is a spawn for one in the locker rooms of the Watoga Civic Center
---
Be sure to flag the developer for your minor cosmetic requests 
---
Get a bunch of junk out,  go in a safe place in your camp and drop in on the floor. If you don't leave the server, should not disappear. 
---
I'm having the same problem as well on PC.
---
If you check the game files, it's all in there, the backpack, the camera, Sheepsquatch stuff and so on. probably easy to do it now and trickle the updates that way. 
---
I wonder how long it will take for someone to clip into the building.
---
Kinky!!!!
---
And apparently my video has no sound ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
---
What crowds? Oh I dont know, ghoul crowds at whitesprings, mob crowds during the queen, mob crowds during any defend event, shall I go on? Without the arc it might as well be called a blue laser rifle. It also does not auto lock. Auto lock is what COD and all the other twitch shooters do when you get close to an enemy with your reticle. What it does do is hit the ground and the arc jumps and hits anything nearby. It's like the electric effect from borderlands. 
---
Point is, if you dont want to get cheesed by it in PVP go get one for yourself to cheese back, or, when you get cheesed walk away, accept the loss, and move on. The Tesla is one of the few new guns to this generation and it would suck to see it lose the only decent part about it because people who only PVP want everything to be "fair" in a RPG game. 
---
Just saying, I think you deserved it for trying to skirt the game's restrictions
---
Basically this. All I'm seeing is all this virtue signalling when there's a fair chance many of the people still making fun of this particular issue probably benefited from duped items even if they didn't dupe themselves.
---
Melee didn't work, looks like I did no damages to him
---
Put my PA and also got one shot by tse
---
Then i got chunked by my turrets dunno how he eated so many shoots at first
---
I'll check that audio control out. I did notice it in the settings but don't think I've messed with it while near a radio. 
---
Awesome find man
---
Experiment with different  tactics and gear. If you're on PS4 I'll take you human- hunting sometime.
---
Woah 
---
Wall Decor.  Scroll down to the Mothman Poster entry (another Atom Shop item) and it is actually to the Left of that poster (when most things are Right).
---
I think the SS is 50. Don't know for the LR.
---
Can't you "sell" it to your bf's character?
---
I honestly can‚Äôt remember the last time I took one. It‚Äôs been weeks. The outputs from the extractors aren‚Äôt that great and you‚Äôre an instant target. It‚Äôs just easier and less aggravating for me to collect junk. 
---
Mmmm not sure about carrying a stove as I think this takes the planing aspect out of the game 
---
It‚Äôs quite satisfying finding a cook spot to make some grub
---
It is survival 
---
Yes, GT: piallator 
---
How is it a restriction if I‚Äôm able to do it? It wasn‚Äôt a restriction at the time. Then Bethesda enabled it into one, because of DUPERS. Not me. And now I‚Äôm left with the repercussions as an honest gamer. 
---
I don't even see any of the "merchants" in game with 4000 worth of stuff lol. 
---
I also have to add plastic (shotgun).
---
Lead Champagne? Neat!
---
new dad; username checks out 
---
Oh yeah. I know of at least one guy who has about 200k nuka's in his inv still. Can still move thanks to weight reduction gear and perks. He duped before the purge, had all those items and didn't get tagged.
---
Oh, you mean the robots? With the pre-programmed items? That had no decent items to sell until a recent update? Or you had to server hop to find what youre looking for? Right. Why would they have 4000 worth of stuff. They‚Äôre not looking to make a profit. 
---
You can't milk Chally
---
She is a proper lady
---
Kicks you, runs away
---
Most of the bugs are fixed but the gameplay is pretty much still the same
---
There are also hardcore rules if you fancy!
---
Screw them. I don't accept the invites either but I'm a different case. I just don't like people lol. 
---
It looks like a firemen‚Äôs outfit. Like the fire breathers but a different color. You can see on the breast pocket it says F.D maybe for Fire Department 
---
Aztec pyramid isnt really doable anymore without floating foundations
---
that outfit sells for liek 7500
---
*Unarmed 
---
Riiiiiight this makes sense. Can‚Äôt remember my agility exactly but I know I‚Äôm constantly overencumbered for the most part, so that explains it. Thanks a bunch man. 
---
Seriously, I can sit there with 5HP with my bloodied handmade and not really even see her health bar go down. 
---
I have the "Lead Champagne Bellini" recipe, which is a mixed drink that uses Lead Champagne.  The one I have has the added effect of "Makes you fall faster".  Kind of funny.  Seems more like a joke item to me (drink a bunch of lead, get heavy!).  Curious if it will do minor things like cause the damage/area affect of say... Explosive Vents, to increase.  Or make lower height drops kill you easier cause you drop to hard.
---
Where do you get it in game?
---
The Storage Area of Silos always has one, can be legendary as well. 
---
Can you milk these too Greggg???
---
I know I‚Äôm just seeing if anyone has it I have people who will give me the amount of caps to buy it I don‚Äôt like it tho
---
I have no idea
---
If you are doing absolutely no damage you may have pacifist mode on.
---
Aww more sadness, I thought they had accidentaled into a good mechanic. 
---
I can‚Äôt get into a trade. Not even an option. 
---
Thank you! My camp is a touch North of that green bush. Lol. There's an acid deposit in the water near there. Or a concrete deposit where I'm at. Also a wild Brahmin spawn just up and right of that green bush icon in the lake. 
---
I would love this ! 
---
I don‚Äôt kill foxes ! 
---
A guy posted a while back about being stuck for a bit in a grenade drop loop with his lifesaving gear.
---
Yeah it would be cool, think you just got lucky. Its actually a good event though, some people pay a lot for level 5 weapon weight reducing armour for mule characters, and thats by far the best way to farm for that sorta stuff
---
I‚Äôm lvl 104 and finally accepted a random invite from a low lvl for the Join a Team achievement. I guess i need to do this 19 more times. And then I can go back to being lone wanderer. 
---
On a related note, I‚Äôm not really into PVP and cannot stand griefers. But I kinda sorta want to grief 20 low lvl players for an easy way to get the kill enemy players achievements. 
---
Just a tip, people like to see what they are buying.  Sales with pictures always sell WAY better than those without. 
---
Been offered 3k. Sorry. 
---
You're literally just looking for excuses to make what you did ok. Do whatever you need to feel good about yourself, but you're not a merchant, you're a server hog. Bethesda was quite clear that it didn't want people making mules with thousands of pounds worth of stuff. Now you're dealing with the consequences for your actions. Getting mad at everyone else isn't going to help you at all. 
---
100000 rounds of 5mm ultracite ammo takes 550ish pieces of flux if u have the right perks less. So very do able in 30 days.
---
yeah, have that plan, and just got a long barrel mod in watoga, lol
---
Without the scrapper perk I get 6 steel from and assault rifle and 4 plastic from a laser rifle. Those are the same as before the patch and you might be right.
---
Thanks for the help and advice I'll need to look into SSDs :) 
---
yeah i agree, but i am buying not selling :)
---
I'm fine with some builds requiring specific counters, but right now this is the ONLY armor that requires it. Shouldn't need another gun just for this cheese. 
---
Besides good gear snd weapons, you need team mates to help take and hold.
---
You on PC?
---
Watoga hs, morgantown HS, and the cat house in morgan town.
---
No, just VATS. Maybe it has something to do with entering and exiting vats as well? 
---
I've got magazines
---
I had to do a double take last night when I was scrapping assault rifles. I won‚Äôt be needing steel any time soon! Definitely some stealth buff at work. I don‚Äôt remember reading about it in the patch notes. 
---
If this happens, thats it, Im getting the game.

There isn't any tbh, the PvP is incredibly unbalanced, don't think of armour for much as almost everyone runs anti armour perks or gear, armour is literally pointless, all the defense is in the perks and prefixes of legendaries and armour modifications. The whole 300/400/500 damage rating only really effects PvE, best PvP builds right now are all without Power Armour, and utilise perks such as, Barbarian (Strength) Blocker (Strength)  IronClad (Endurance) Fireproof (Endurance) Dodgy (Agility) Evasive (Agility) Serendipity (Luck) pair those with Vanguard/Sentinal/Cavalier/Bolstering/Assassins armour for less damage from players/whilst sprinting/whilst stood stiil Also mod armour with Dense mods so you take less fire and explosive damage. All in all the percentage matters more than hard numbers.
---
So. After the latest update when I logged in a got notice. "Due to the latest update your camp was unable to place you will get a free camp placement." But when that happened all my crops were gone and my water purifier was gone from my stored items. So I new something was up, then I noticed my caps.

Don't take workshops if you don't want to get killed. 
---
Of course not. Nobody likes it when they change the lore. But just because they say that mutation works one way doesn't mean it can't work another way. I'm not suggesting that they should just that it is possible for them to do it. And I'm also not advocating for snake squids, I'll actually prefer just a mutant snake, but a squid or octopus would be great to fish. 
---
Not excuse my dude. It‚Äôs the truth. When was that made clear by Bethesda that they don‚Äôt want people roleplaying in there RPG? I have a fightpit going rn. Bethesda made it quite clear they don‚Äôt want DUPERS.
---
Remind me and i'll give you a mod too. 
---
I keep forgetting about the cat house....
---
No when you are in a workshop fight even if you have pacifist on you will go out of pacifist as long as they contest the workshop. What happens is they probably have assassins armor so you do next to no damage to them. When you combine that with other perks and chems you become a god. its PvP breaking and makes PvP pointless unless you also have the same build as them. 
---
I‚Äôve switched again 
---
Pets could disappear when in combat for now.  That might help :)  but agreed... there are other things to look at 1st .
---
Did reinstalling work? 
---
That said you can use PA, but you can't use Barbarian/Serendipity/Evasive/Ironclad but you can use certain mods against player such as reactive plates (reflect 50% melee damage), or Emergency Protocols (50% reduction to incoming damage and +25% movement when below 20% health)
---
PA users are kinda dead in PvP
---
Maybe you aren't
---
Soft restrictions are still restrictions. Yes people ended up abusing the absurdity so they had to turn it into a hard restriction. Sucks for y'all
---
I do it occasionally for the plans....
---
If you want it back, just kill me and we're good.
---
Or you can team up and I will leave it to you. 
---
Just wanted to know if playing vending was my solution. Jfc. I grinded the game for 500+ hours with the intention of selling my shit. They add player trading.  Am I not supposed to use that ability? Is that NOT what it was intended for? 
---
Guys.... lets not undercut everything to the point its almost free. Make a fair price and keep it there.
---
You don't need 4000 pounds of stuff to RP. If you were really RPing you wouldn't have 4000 pounds on an alt, because 4000 pounds would kill your alt. 
---
If it was just dupers then the weight limit for not being able to drop stuff would be a lot higher than it is, wouldn't it? 
---
Just because there are counters doesn't mean it's ok
---
Would be a lot better once they get the server's good enough to handle more players at once.
---
I know not suggesting you did or do. This is the devs lazy way to deal with real dupers with complete disregard to regular players like us that just want to collect things. That being said 5000lbs quit a lot of stuff, dump anything you don't need, get rid of all junk, try get to the point where you can transfer some stuff into your stash you want to keep, not sure what you can or cannot do. Get some escalator PA with calibrated shocks, this way it will help you keep some stuff while sorting thru your stuff maybe.  Bottom line you probably going to have to get rid of half your stuff which is a real shame.
---
Lazy lazy lazy devs is all I can say with complete disregard for non dupers.
---
Oh, I am not used to the shortened "w:"
---
I didn't know she came with a name either lol
---
I don't know about random visitors, but I'm confident the owner always spawn north of their camp station. However, for strangers I feel as if it's random, but I'm unsure. 
---
But I do agree with you. Having the ability to place waypoints would be everything so much easier.
---
Max stash limit is 800, do you think they're going to let you dump 4000 pounds in a shop? lol   
---
If you can't take stuff off your alt anyway, there's no harm in waiting for the vending to come out and see how much you can put in there. 
---
Only if you have a crappy system, and a even crappier internet connection.... lol
---
I heard Fog Crawlers and Hermit Crabs where in the Mire but I have been desperately trying to find them with no luck
---
Bethesda is discouraging players to stop looking and exploring for items. Did you not play fallout four? Stash boxes full of supplies. Now I collected it for other players STARTING FROM THE BETA. and Bethesda is ruining the experience. 
---
Is there an echo in here? 
---
...and 'git gd', really?

---
This matches up with the new underground area beneath the location
---
Ah. I had someone contest my workshop and he started coming after me and I didn‚Äôt do any damage to him until I took off pacifist. Not sure what that was about then.
---
And that's cheap, cheapest I saw when searching was $16K, so $7.5K seems like a deal
---
There's usually always some crawlers in the treehouse village 
---
Crippling, Hitman, Steadfast etc.....anyone know what these effects are?
---
used the W: for Wanted, since people are used to it from the trading groups :)
---
You might get a bit more visitors if you post on the fo76filthycasual sub, can‚Äôt link you on mobile tho but I think that community would appreciate your B.A.R.
---
There's a long-standing bug where fast travel doesn't work immediately after joining a server. You have to move around a little bit and _then_ open the map for fast travel to be available.
---
If you have 10 things fermenting then you can't add more to the stash, you just unassign them and then you can put more in there
---
I briefly set up there as well (lack of water for purifiers made me relocate) but it was cute and fun. Until one of my perks/mutations (can't recall which) killed a kitty. I was so sad. üò≠
---
Nice..where I'm 430 hours still TSE-less
---
I crafted everything myself, I've only played solo
---
Seriously it was a bad way to deal with duping. They say the game is intended to play indefinitely so I stocked up on items to sell to low level players, legendary items, aid items. Stuff people would want to buy! I‚Äôd just would pick up legendary items in bags people would drop in nuked whitesprings ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è someone might want it eventually. I‚Äôm not smart enough or cheap enough to dupe honestly üòÇ I was just looking to see if the vending is a solution to my problem ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and got jumped down the throat lmao I‚Äôm not the only one in this position. People collect things. I don‚Äôt want to collect more. I don‚Äôt want to destroy things. I want to sell my items otherwise it‚Äôs my wasted time in this RPG game. I should be at least able to trade and not accept anything back into my inventory. 
---
Ah shaddap in you face.
---
nope, no friends here
---
There was more than enough lag at launch, verified by plenty of people with a range of systems. I have a solid system that runs FO4 like butter, and even I had notable lag and hitches for that first month.

yes really
---
I think they should‚Äôve dealt with this differently. People who are playing overweight  are at LEAST able to sell the shit they have so they can get underweight. 
---
My bro is like 160 hours in, he got a TSE western revolver and minigun he's so lucky 
---
Durability, repair costs, fusion core drain, I think you‚Äôre worried about the wrong things in intelligence and luck.

before the 75% explosive nerf I would have said demolition expert too. 
---
Agility is the only one that pains me to be as low as it is. I would have action boy active if I didn‚Äôt need thru hiker.
---
Hating on my strategy. I say it‚Äôs strong. 
---
Don't defend unless you actually want to learn PvP. Unless you have top end gear, a proper PvP build and a lot of experience, you're just throwing away caps. Never hang around in your workshop because that makes it really easy for solo PvPers. You're safe during a defense event but fast travel out immediately afterwards.
---
If you really want to take them on, I'm not sure there's a cheap solution to breaking Sentinel with melee. Maybe Pain Train, but you'd probably need Fireproof and stealth boys to not get one-shot before you reach. 
---
It's likely that the area is marked, because they're going to do something with it in another content drop
---
Yeah, I'm thinking for whatever reason it just wasn't before and is now just working correctly.
---
Anything not on top of a structure gets lost when you move camp
---
Played since BETA, and only issues I had were sever disconnects, but now lag. Then again I do run a 1GB Synchronous connection ... lol
---
I do that too.  Lots of lower levels die near SBQ, I like to fill their bag with plans and loot.  They probably don't even notice until later if they just R to take all so it's like "Where did I get this?"
---
No need to be a dick. Move along.
---
That's too bad. I had unofficially teamed up with a lower level during a Whitespring nuke and he died. So I sat on top of his loot so nobody could see it until he came back to claim it. I got a thumbs up and we went our separate ways.
---
All of my workbenches were on foundations and I was missing neon letters as well.
---
I have TSE prime minigun. Ammo aint really problem, when you collect and craft with proper perk cards and shoot when SBQ is landed. There are 2 reason why I don't use it- First: I have no sense of how much damage I am doing per second. F#ck it, ill use some low level weapon and I feel like I am doing same damage as I am doing with my prime minigun. There is no indication that I am doing better with my minigun with special ammo. Second: When SBQ is being done by level 44 with pipe pistols, I don't feel like I wanna invest my special ammo so that those low levels that do 0 damage get rewarded same way as I do. F#ck it, ill do low damage also.

I appreciate it! I am on Xbox...I rarely get on though..today was the first time in a week or two

I got a level TSE Hunting rifle as my first TSE drop as well about a month ago.  Thankfully mine was a level 50. [ps4]
---
Prior to that I had a One Shot Explosive 5.56 machine gun drop.  
---
I do have a TSE shotgun from a casual trade but somehow the Hunting rife feels more like an achievement because I worked for it.  
---
And no, none are for sale...
---
Don‚Äôt be sorry m8
---
If they're selling them that cheap then they're duped.
---
Crippling is 50 percent more limb damage, Hitman is 10 percent more damage for aiming, and Steadfast is bonus protection when reloading.
---
They're cheap to buy. If you're caps poor just inside the hangar entrance of Emmet Brothers Disposal Site is a great place to farm mutations. It has a high rad zone (for mutation farming more rads at once is better than less rads but over time, so standing in water for instance isn't ideal) right next to a decontamination arch. The arch will remove mutations though so be careful if you're just trying to remove rads.

Have a friend break the workbench. Or leave the game

Start at Green County travel south along the river. Definitely have Green Thumb. Lots of Snaptail for sugar and Rum.

Being able to prestige might solve this issue once they add it.
---
üíØ Keep fighting the good fight. Sentinel is OP A-N-D CHEESE. It's as imbalanced as TSE used to be. 
---
The fact that there are counters doesn't mean it's in balance. I shouldn't need additional weapons or perks against this ONE build ONLY. 
---
And I don't have a lot of sympathy for those who joined the bandwagon to ::ahem:: stand still in combat virtually impervious; and damn the dupers who made the problem systemic. 
---
It's in the files, it just doesn't actually spawn anywhere yet. It might show up in future updates, though. /u/ladydevann, do you know if they plan to fully implement the outfit any time soon?
---
just curious. why don't you go on market76 and look for and buy a TSE you want?. 500 hours in you have got to have caps just sitting there.

I'd recommend a Gatling build instead because of the ammo savings and power of each bullet.

No witch hunting doesn't mean people can't call you names on this subreddit. It means you can't post a players username or in game name here and incite others to attack or hassle them in game. People get banned for this all the time.

I had no idea! I really want to take a picture with every single creature in this game. I hunted down all the Cryptids first because I thought everything else would be really easy but these one keep giving me trouble
---
Me, would make PVE servers more calm, and let raiders and mercs run wild separate from the people that wanna be away from them
---
"This is a survival game" Yes, as such, I believe that if you're starving and have wood, steel, and a piece of raw meat in your inventory, you should be well enough equipped to erect your own station. I feel that adding a mechanic to support this would lead to a more survival feel than not having one. Afterall, survival games are at their strongest point when the player can interact with his/her surroundings.
---
I think it may just be random loot, because the times I've run into him he did have anything special
---
Just like Seymour in Futurama
---
lol well, scorchbeasts arent the best for "profit" anyways - just hard to take down so significant challenge the first time.  UH if you're on PC I could help replenish some supplies.  I'm sitting on like 100 stimpacks right now (since the update I started playing again and I'm making my guy a chemist/alcoholist xD lol)  IGN DestaZalinto if on PC :P
---
He was sought after because he has the disco ball plans but now since every trader has all plans it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore 
---
yep, I agree with that.
---
He carries some rare CAMP plans and weapon plans you can't get off vendors currently.  He has a pool of plans and sometimes the more hard to find ones are available.

Fog crawlers are a little less predictable, but if you head south from thunder mountain and stay to the east of the river, you'll most likely bump into some. Also anglers and gulpers! If you get to the abandoned waste dump, you're at the limit of likelihood for your baddies, but there'll always be the 2 deathclaws in the cave or 3 if you came with friends! =) happy hunting!

Using V.A.T.S I got into the location and your Right! It even has a working stash! [https://imgur.com/a/qTMHBWs](https://imgur.com/a/qTMHBWs)

Yeah, it has always been there.
---
Theres some people that have been saying "lol Bethesda is still incompetent. They can't even keep unreleased content secret" where in reality this was done purposefully so that we the community hype the content up by discovering it.
---
This mode we‚Äôll have to be well thought out for it to work. You don‚Äôt want a situation where you can‚Äôt play with your friends because you happen to be level 5 at the time.
---
Agree
---
It was done purposefully so that things exactly like this post happen and hype the content up.

Can‚Äôt find anyone bidding on your other posts 
---
I see your point, but especially with f076 (Since around 40-60% of the songs ingame are from fo3 or fo4), the music can get VERY repetitive. What if somebody discovered some new music and sold it to the radio. Or better yet, like in fo4, somebody in the wastes made some music and it was played on the radio.

You're right, Bethesda should be checking to make sure all third party content is compatible with their game. Fuck outta here.

Cool! Thanks !had no idea

I got a 3 star legendary pipe rifle yesterday, level 1. Good buffs, I forgot what they were though. Waited at Vault 76 for almost an hour waiting for a new player. Dude was super appreciative. I even modded it out for extra damage. Felt good. I'm not bored at all with the game but I couldn't let such a good starter gun go to waste.

What are the ten ways then?
---
Hot tub and beer kegs! 
---
Definitely! It‚Äôs no accident that there are giant holes in all those windows. 
---
Maybe because I play with a friend who's also a bloodied build and the bonuses (if applied properly with class freak and strange in numbers) would make us near godlike when in a team? And I don't always have a friend to play with? Also my build doesn't really matter. It's a problem that takes a minute to fix, makes the game near unplayable under conditions that are very easy to attain and still isn't.
---
Nah.
---
I built my camp there once, just to give him a home :(
---
thx you
---
What kind of stuff are u carrying? Weapons? Armor? Aid?
---
Nice!
---
Legendary power armors, hell yes!   
---
(okey, too soon, but down the line)
---
Ok. Thanks!
---
That would be great, as it stands currently, I think any existing buildable area, no matter how remote it is, can become no build zone after a patch.
---
Mines between south of Watoga station &amp; north of survey site alpha.
---
What are you carrying? Weapons ? Armor? Aid?
---
nope its still a two handed weapon. when you wear power armor you are powerful enough to use a two handed with one hand. it is only one handed to show that when you use power armor you are stronger (lore wise). so you dont need to change perks.
---
It‚Äôs just that I still see a lot of people posting that they‚Äôve found him and for people to join, like it‚Äôs a must for them to trade with him. 
---
Yeah, I have a AAE Gatling that's my main and then I have a AA Minigun for cleaning corridors and pinch points cause of the high fire rate. I eat through 800+ rounds cleaning White Springs though with the AA minigun.

When was tge quantum paintjob added?
---
They exist for workshops under the last tab. They do not exist for camps.
---
Im 600+ hours still havent got one.
---
Xbox one with same issue
---
Ho i never even thought of that. I always thought they deliberately made them not have legendaries so normal armor can be viable. But shitt if they do that will be busted
---
when you land it makes the ground pound sound like power armor. Had goat legs on so didnt notice damage.

Glad you understand.

I'm not sure if the magazine's can be done similarly to the bobbleheads, but you can (in the past) grab one (bobblehead) and stash it and withdrawal it multiple times and it (used to count as a new item. I did it by accident with the bobbleheads. You can usually spawn one magazine at a bus on the road  slightly north of the watgoa high school at next to the bus stop. Same spot usually spawns a common outfit and a stealthboy.

All up and down it.

I bought the WV paint, it looks pretty cool with the red nuka torso

I want some taters for my vodka! 
---
They simply don't have the skill or ability to put more depth in this game than what you see. .. seriously you all need to start playing another game now.
---
Damage shown is per shot (per projectile).
---
I think it depends on how much luck your character have or what location you farm the legendaries from. It feels like i get more explosive weapons now after the purge, maybe its because the duping those ppl did was affecting the drop rate or something.
---
so it works more like a shotgun instead like a 5 shot 
---
sweet, right up the road from my camp (xbox) and i have a public stash/armor/weapons/and water.
---
When I used it on a laser rifle each beam did the normal damage, so if they all hit it did 5x damage. I haven't tried it since the patch but I stopped using it because it also broke your weapon 5x faster.

We lucked into ours.  I highly recommend taking power plants at least once a week to load up on fusion cores.  I wasted 3 or 4 cores the first day playing around.  I have gotten really good at using the boost to use it as long as possible.  Also have the fusion core perk on and load up on ap food and drinks when you want the most hangtime.

There's a run in Watoga, including Appalachian Antiques, that I find 8-9 magazine spawns (without loading into buildings). Now of course they don't always spawn.
---
Starting at Appalachian Antiques, one behind the counter with the cash register.
---
Inside the bus stop, where there is a lvl 3 locked door with a power generator and power armor behind it, there is one in the broken elevator.
---
Right outside there's two buses, the one on the left on the seat.
---
There's another one up some stairs on a table, kind of hard to explain where it is... leave the bus station and make a right and a left.
---
On top of the high school.
---
At the end of the monorail car in the air by the high school.
---
One in the bus below the 4 buses in the parking lot outside the train station.
---
Two can spawn at the restaurant behind Super Duper mart. On a table and on the yellow magazine rack.
---
Having the perk card helps too.

There is a vault jumpsuit clothing item that doesn't operate as under armor

People can also tag and track you with Berry tats or recon scope

What‚Äôs that helmet? Nuka girl?
---
Playing FO4, if someone flattened Dogmeat, I'd scream something like "not my fucking dog!" and pummel (or attempt to pummel) the offender. First time I did it when my wife was around made her run into the room, wife eyed, asking what had happened.  She was kind pissed when I explained but when I showed her the "Dogmeat hurt" animation she agreed. 
---
Dogmeat a good boi dogo.

I call BS on headshots; you're up to 3. 
---
Yup the nuka girl helm, I bought it before it was removed from the store solely for the helmet! Looks great when used with the t-51b chest in PA. 
---
Yeah normally people are amazing in this game. Like the other day I had a bounty on me cuz I touched a supply drop, I was super confused as it was quest but whatever. So the guys that ended up killing me left my loot and even game me a plasma grenade. 
---
ƒ∞m adding you guys to
---
I really like the high rof, chrome skin, working sight and bad assery of the minigun. So I‚Äôm set on the TSE I got.

I'd say a combination of that and stability testing.  They can stealth test if an addition will cause a crash. Fixing uo a house/station and blocking entry, especially if it's not inatanced. 
---
BTW, for the apologists crying 'BUT COUNTERS', there are counters to those.

Tell me what you so i can see if i have it. Dont want to waste anyones time.
---
700+ hours here and have yet to get a TSE drop, was lucky to get a few good organic trades though. Tons of TS, no TSE.
---
To date I think my best drop was my quad explosive handmade. Though I can't help but wonder how many decent explosives I inadvertently dropped before I realized that you had to manually inspect a legendary to see the effect.
---
actually idgaf. headshots work for me

Name him macc

thats the one without vats, yes? I'll have a think give me a few hours.
---
Only 102 here but concur - I‚Äôve done everything from giving a few waters to building them a nuclear power source...
---
Weirdest thing is that its in apparel and not junk
---
I‚Äôve been playing them in a druken manner, from F4 to Fnv, then 76 and then F1. Hopefully I‚Äôll survive this crazy order and finish all the games atleast once :) imo, I loved nv world building but wished the gunplay was better coming from traditional shooters and F4.
---
Yep this. He was a bigger deal before whatever patch made it so other traders carry more reliable stock.
---
He's still fun to find just because it's so random but stuff-wise he's nowhere near as special as he used to be.
---
Nice! I wondered if that might be how they implement it. 
---
Level 89. Haven't seen him once myself.
---
Last night I saw a level 7 in the ash heap around my area so i went to see if they needed anything. Gave her stimpaks, radaway, purified water, ammo, springs, adhesive, leather, screws. She asked if I would craft her armor and a couple of weapons so i said sure. Crafted her a couple of brotherhood rifles decked out, levels 5 and 10. Same thing with serrated combat knives and a 10mm submachine gun. It was the stuff she had requested. Then did a full set of sturdy leather armor also modded out. She dipped out. Stopped responding to my messages. 
---
Got a bit upset but ended up finding a level 8 in Morgantown who was doing the Collision Course event. Helped him through it then gave him all the stuff i had made for her, plus more ammo, stimpaks, food, water, and about 30 plans. All the while i was trading with him another higher level was sniping scorched out so i could finish the trade. I think it worked out the way it was supposed to.
---
Psn? 
---
I have a few where I took pics with folks AFK... love seeing those
---
Paddywop918 
---
if he was alive, the list would never end.
---
And then we could have robot wars to contest workshops in special arenas we  build..
---
Or maybe jacc
---
They can spawn on mongrel corpses and you can g ere t one off the dog corpse in the cage with a ranger corpse at the freak show
---
Lets cross fingers and hope we can get pets soon.
---
Where would those be?
---
If you go right on the challenge it shows
---
It's because it's apparel for dogs.
---
It's a leftover from Fallout 4 still in the files, odds are it wasn't supposed to ever spawn in. So it's classified as apparel as you could put it onto dogs in Fallout 4.
---
He has never attacked me and since the update I‚Äôve went for him once and never became hostile. I saw someone say on here once to wait until he‚Äôs up there and not run up on the brahmin too fast 
---
must've missed it...
---
What are TSE‚Äôs lul idk I‚Äôm kinda a new player
---
a friend of mine had that problem and found that it was a custom .ini file he added to fix some of the problems the game still had, he removed it and the falling stopped.
---
I use a troubleshooters multi purpose axe with increased heavy attack damage for the silos. Does wonders. 
---
I have two, both level 50. I use one on the daily but would definitely sell you the other. I‚Äôm on right now if you want it. 
---
A gift emote would be great. I tend to jump up and down on my paper bag and then shooting at it when trying to give stuff to lower levels. Pulling out a gun to show someone a gift is a bit aggressive. And it doesn‚Äôt help if they run away, because if I chase them it‚Äôs just worse. 
---
Ye sure lvl 57 
---
Psn is Krisiboy21
---
I tried several times today to help out lower levels by dropping stuff on the ground for them to pick up, not one person took up the offer and a couple logged out as soon as they saw me. I've never had an issue with another player, but I'm aware it happens, so I can't blame them for the caution.
---
The most success I had all day on that front was helping a level 8/9 in the Feed the People event. 
---
Do you have any shotgun shells ?
---
Sometimes it drops from the front.
---
I've got a quad western revolver on one character and a quad fire rate gauss on the other. Once I got the quad fire rate gauss that character almost never swaps (and when I do it is to an instigating for long range work). The quad western I rarely use as I have a host of good 10mm on that character (tse, 2x aae, vamp e)
---
I do have an instigating western or single action I use sometimes but mostly snipe with a pipe bolt action.
---
He does that to me sometimes.  I try to avoid going near his brahmin and eyebots and open trade as quickly as possible.
---
Yes I do. 
---
Not only more quests, but how different quest lines start. I discovered the 'Mistress of Mystery' and excavator quests pretty much by accident, just out wandering around. Same thing for the start of the Enclave questline, just happened to walk into a cave randomly. 
---
Not to mention the 'Overseer' quests seem to be completely random and without an a-to-b-to-c line, more of a 'hey, a big-ass blue box' accidental discovery.
---
There aren't 'quest hubs' like I was used to with, say, World of Warcraft or any of the other MMOs I'd played in the past. Makes it rather difficult, lots of 'well, what now'?
---
Mic, nac, paddy wacc.....just give the dog a bone!
---
Que ? lol :)
---
He used to have interesting and unique plans, but ever since Patch 5 adjusted the vendor inventories, he's basically been a simulcast of what's being offered at Watoga Station.
---
Having something other than bookshelves and desks to create the actual bar would be nice. 
---
Well I found a dog helmet at this one sideshow looking location. Maybe dogs are coming soon?
---
hehehe rear drop... but no, chance at Ranger Station so fairly easy to get hopping... üëçüèª
---
Do you know what an average cost for that is on here?
---
Check you have updated your Fallout76Custom.ini file, you do NOT have to stop using mods.
---
`[Archive]`
---
`sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2`
---
Then after the above enter your mod entries as before i.e.
---
...SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, **GammaBeastProjectile.ba2, ore\_glow.ba2,**
---
not forgetting the comma and space between entries.
---
Look. I understand your upset but get over it and stop attacking /mocking everyone. This is how all mmorg games work. The players do bad things, the devs respond with more rules, and then we adapt to those rules. You have no choice but to delete items. Get past it and move on.
---
No idea. I found mine, I couldn‚Äôt imagine it would be that much. I think any axe or hammer with troubleshooter and increase heavy attack damage will work fine though. 
---
that is where i found it, was looking for a chainsaw to do some lumber, found the chainsaw and this, never seen it before, have 155 levels on xbox and 110 on pc, lol
---
Kinda cool helmet :)
---
Oh, you're talking about numbers before when adrenal was broken in our favor. Yeah, those days aren't coming back. Adrenal is supposed to cap at +50% damage, and it wasn't. They broke it totally. We complained. They fixed it, but for reals. It now caps where it was always supposed to. This isn't why you do less in a team than solo, but it is why you do less now than before they fixed adrenal reaction. 
---
There are two of them as world spawns at the ranger district office in Cranberry Bog.
---
On the Xbone, I've noticed a good increase. I didn't get bothered by too many issues to begin with, but the experience is a lot better now. 
---
Also convinced my brother to pick it up and he thinks it's a solid game too. 
---
Have you tried to scarp one ? dont want to destroy it if i can re make it or go server hopping a lot :)
---
Ok, thank you!
---
I wish I could get the hot rod skin 
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want you to start/finish quest lines just so you don‚Äôt beat the few that there are too quickly
---
Good to know.  Thanks!
---
There it is, to
---
Can you milk it?
---
Sick find man!  Going to check it out later :D
---
And that's where your contribution to a meaningful discourse ends and the emptiness of your original claim becomes apparant. 
---
Np
---
Yeah stop bothering with normal armor. I make a decision on a character to be in pa or not, and if it is pa mainly I keep no normal armor.
---
You do want to mod that pa too. Calibrated shocks for sure for 100 more carry. Excavator is another 100, likely to put you in the 400s for carry.
---
Plus you are keeping too much ... :)
---
Also keep your pa pieces in a frame ...
---
Yeah I get you. Problem is, majority of the highly sought after plans are wayyyyy expensive, I struggle to collect caps for some reason. 
---
Was this perhaps a player name and they backed out of claiming your workshop so they could then find you and kill you?
---
Hey still got some?
---
Yep all out of shells for now tho
---
Any luck yet?
---
I use 50, 5mm, 40 mm, cryo. Heavy weapon stuff
---
Yeah it‚Äôs more so NPC enemies as oppose to actual other players. 
---
Hate to necro, but found a two-shot with the flamer mod for 183 at watoga. Easy W.
---
Just an FYI it doesn't look as good as it does in fo4
---
No, it said said the regular text that it does when your worship is under attack by hostiles. Not another player
---
Yes, saw this in the Atom Store at one point
---
Well two shot mod died a while back right? 
---
Just lmk if you sold it so I can bid on others 
---
Yeah, it was just super convenient for me to be able to login, do the challenges, head to a nuke zone for flux, max vendor caps, and call it a day; mostly because I have a busy schedule and don't really have time to play for hours on end.
---
Thanks Shadow. I usually don't pick up these type of items, so I tend to ignore them in game. I've only just started using the alcohol items because daily requirements.
---
Again, thank you for the info.
---
Where does the cap spawn at? Is it the same spot as the jacket?
---
You could scroll through the many ways on this thread or you could use the internet your connected to. My favorite is the option you chose though. You can wait for me to spoon feed it to you, I'll get right on working on that list for you. 
---
Not yet, I only just found them today, but I lost four hours of junk to a respawn bug and rage quit before I had a chance to really check them out. ;)
---
Are you still there? My PSN is WavyNoobSauce
---
I also toss +2 str on my excavator torso for a bit more carry and some melee oomph until I move to x01 or 51 post 50. 
---
For the other armors, if the calibrated shocks are hard for you to find on the x01, use the t60 legs ... those shocks are easier to find.
---
Ya still here
---
Dosent sound very fun :/
---
Think so, nice find out of the blue though.
---
Calibrated shocks plans for T45 51 and 60 can be bought from the BOS Watoga vender.
---
I found a plan to this in the game world too
---
Good to know. I'm almost at 100 so I have a bit of grinding to do.
---
I recently got killed by two level 200+ players that almost always one shot me :( I was just minding my own business in my workshop as a level 20.
---
They 're coming.in future updates. 
---
The funny part is that we asked for excavator skins to not look like bumblebees,and so they decide to drop a skin like that for the ultracite
---
/logic.
---
Thank you for the ammo much appreciated 
---
Yep whacha need.
---
iirc he has the radiaton emitter plans aswell among other stuff. Legendary grahm has more item with him so that's a good find most of the time.
---
My camp is just north of the vendor, it will be great to have a neighbor.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes you need to actually scrap the floor/foundation, and then the turret will show up in your Saved inventory.  Just an FYI in case you run into that problem...
---
Provided their steps don‚Äôt sound like Dogmeat‚Äôs I‚Äôm all for it.
---
Sorry boy but I gotta leave you behind.   You sound like you are wearing tap dancing shoes and I have no way to trim your nails.
---
If you start trying to farm it understand it doesn't spawn a quest everyday
---
Your world is full atm, I'm queue'd to join.
---
This. Mac‚Äôs Farm, which is south of General‚Äôs Steakhouse, has a shack near the bog where a Mirelurk Queen spawns. Inside that shack you can find a few Cranberry Moonshines if you get lucky. Server hop until one spawns in the shack.
---
After I got two, I went to Watoga and did a loop killing the robots to get the 25 kills while intoxicated on it. It only took one drink to finish that daily since I had three points into Party Boy. 
---
I know I'm asking ppl to leave once done
---
luck, agility, vats and maybe sneak. Be prepared to use other weapons for bigger tougher enemies though since pistols have almost no armor penetration. If you are going for pistol and single shot rifles/snipers you could pick up a decent bolt action pipe rifle/pistol. since it benefits form park cards for both pistols and rifles. It will help you conserve ammo and kill the routine farming stuff.
---
How much for the 38?
---
Heavy weapon stuff. 50, 5mm , 40 mm, cryo. Harpoons
---
Yea someone told me that last night and it worked thank god! I though my camp was about to be bugged until a new patch came out.
---
still enough ways to counter sentinel and that was my point
---
Took me some time to understand what you where on about, lol
---
Can't edit the subject line, so it will just have to stay, hehehe
---
And no, i am not English :D
---
I found him about 3 times so far. I didn‚Äôt realize he was this rare. I tried to take some pics with him but they came out ridiculous. I honestly never knew he had any cool plans like that. Hope I see him again now. Also, has anyone discovered the lemonade robot? I just did. But I only saw him once. Is he new?
---
I knew he was supposed to be a great find as he‚Äôs a random encounter. The first time I saw him he had quite a nice variety of loot, but the second was just dreadful. 
---
No not seen a lemonade robot? Whereabouts did you find it? 
---
I find that all Brahmin become hostile when I get close to them for some reason. 
---
This seems to prompt the bots to then become hostile.
---
When you say Legebdary Grahm, do you mean he comes in different versions? Ha or am I being stupid? 
---
I guess you sold it, no worries bro. It‚Äôs tough to bid higher when no one else bids on the actual page but it‚Äôs your item so you can do whatever you want, have a good one!
---
Go to the river next to the Overseers camp and run south. 
---
This has occurred to me several times since the patch.  And I thought I was lucky, previously, in that crashes and disconnects only happened to me about one a fortnight
---
&gt;The Nukashine Challenge
---
Attempt #2 is uploading now.
---
I ended up way further away from my C.A.M.P. this time, and died a few times on the way. 
---
Thank you :)
---
Legendary modifiers Twin Shot (fires two bullets instead of one) and Explosive (bullets explode).
---
The fact this game is really on it's way to a 180 is well, really weird. And surprising. What are we, about 103 right now?
---
Two-shot explosive 
---
I‚Äôm not OP I just have the playtime paint
---
They fixed the legendary issue, the damage is on par with other comparable weapons, and what do you want them to do with the penetration? Just forget that leather=higher energy resistance and that means that critters with thick hides should have high energy DR? You shouldn't be using energy weapons against critters, by all available information in the game. Same way the gamma gun doesn't work against anything with high Rad DR. 
---
What level? I‚Äôm 28 rn but I‚Äôm using the .50 MG a lot recently so if you need a horde killer
---
76 wanted players though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
I just built a multi level tree house in the mire. Tons of great views
---
I don't only pvp. Anyways, thanks for being so constructive on a game advertised to have PVP. All im suggesting is that to activate the chaining you should have to accurately engage at least 1 target in the group, is that really so bad?
---
I must've got lucky. Have X01 jetpack for a month or so, and haven't been able to sell it.
---
Is there a guide for that
---
I so wish I could take on a bunch of animal companions to replace the people friends I don't have and never had
---
I finally realized I looked aggressive when pointing (with a gun) from the person to the bag. It's almost like you're threatening them. "LOOK IN THE BAG!! LOOK!! LOOOOOOK!!!!"
---
Replaying responder events
---
Shotguns upclose, .50 cal from any distance, gamma gun, pain train, rifles (auto specifically with tank killer), heavy melee attack (or seemingly a regular attack with powerfist). This is off the top of my head.
---
I know it was a mistake bud lol. It was just a joke. Tu sabe mucho Ingles para non viven America. Yo hablo un pocito Espanol. Good luck out there man.
---
I really don‚Äôt like killing people. I just want to play, kill other NPC‚Äôs and that‚Äôs about it. The more the merrier. But every now and again a person will come around I guess trying to get that reward. I‚Äôm almost lvl 100 and I have not been able to ever defeat anyone unless someone helps me. Idk why. It is very frustrating because I feel picked on at times. Which I understand is the way you play the game. The other day I got destroyed by someone who was a lvl 23. He got 150 caps. I sought revenge and every single time he beat me. When I was down 1000 (I‚Äôm stubborn) I decided enough was enough and I switched worlds and started killing NPC‚Äôs again. I don‚Äôt know what to do but I feel as if the fight has been unfair. At this point I just try and defend myself. I‚Äôve put on pacifist. And I don‚Äôt go that route. I would not mind the challenge of playing against other players. That does actually sound fun. It‚Äôs just that I never win and I am a sore loser. Sorry for the rant. 
---
I mean really regular armor should be inferior. It just makes sense. I like occasionally crafting a set of good heavy leather and running around, or if I'm sniping, but if you're jumping in the middle of shit or exploring PA is the way to go.
---
Thx 
---
This is a very common problem that many people on PC have had. They've known the fix is the ini file for a while. :)
---
I see you're loving yourself.
---
You can! If you get level 3 in animal friend and pacify an animal that's on it's own you'll be able to take it and send it to your C.A.M.P.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin getting one. 
---
I can't afford to repurchase fallout 76 again to set it up under another email. I like playing but it's definitely isn't worth another purchase. I have other emails, but fallout 76 is linked to my primary. Is transfer it if that was a possibility to change what is displayed in game. 
---
Like I said, I set it up with my email when fallout shelter came out. Its single player. Never would have figured when fallout 76 came out they would use your account name in a multiplayer game and not give you the option to change it. Its my full name, wouldn't take a genius to figure out my email address and have it hacked. Been there, done that. If Bethesda wants to compete with steam and epic with their own launcher, they need to have same options to change your displayed name. I can't play with it like this. So 80 bucks down the tubes. 
---
Perhaps the massive hole in the floor will be at the end of the underground raid and the reward for getting past all the ghouls.
---
Sure. 2x boiled water, 2x cranberry (fresh, not diseased), 3x snaptail. IGN: jchamlin
---
I am really hoping they change them to default on
---
Originally you said to take the arc away. No it isn't bad to have to have a hit for it to arc. It may make more sense like that anyway but that could be argued too. It's like the random arc hits suggestion, that is good for PVP but could get really annoying in PVE when you use the gun for the arc.
---
You are right, the game has PVP elements but in my opinion a lot of the PVP complaints come from those who want everyone to be on an equal playing field and that just isn't possible in this game. You seem like someone who can think critically so I wont bother explaining why. 
---
Thanks for the discussion. 
---
Thank ya (:
---
zzSHADYMAGICzz
---
Me too. It's a pain to keep on turning these on.
---
Why thank you
---
Lol this maybe but I don‚Äôt think they purposely put a purple square on that vault door in the NW part of the map 
---
My tag is Hivemind56 and I‚Äôm trying to get a nice supply of 5.56 going and will gladly take any anyone has to spare!
---
Kill‚Äôem, peace in death, and a nice dog steak meal 
---
Too bad you cant give him some saddle bags
---
Killing and griefing other players are the best part of this game. Like, only reason I am playing this game really.
---
Same
---
Offer
---
Oh finally Iv always wanted my camp to be on the map for everyone, I set mine up so if people needed plants or water I had more then enough and all crafting stations to.
---
Thanks.
---
I have the toilet and bathtub plans. If you are on PC I can give it to you.
---
Someone up in the comments here already got in
---
I can think critically but not organized. I also ignorantly did not 100% understand the gun (i only knew it did not require aim). Soon in the future i'll make a more informed post. That gun is the last thing that needs balance. Bloodied is nerfed (my build) and im ok with that because it was really too powerful. Regardless ill be making another post with proper terms and a more accurate suggestion that wont ruin the gun but make it not so mindlessly powerful in pvp. Key word is mindless, idc if its strong but the mindless part is the problem.
---
Yeah, same with literally shooting the bag. Even as a high level I get nervous if I hear shots going off near me, I can only imagine how that would be taken if I'm at Whitespring with some low level and start popping off my explosive shotty to get their attention. They're scared enough of me just being there as is.
---
All I have is 60 atm
---
This is a new problem for me, and man no is it annoying.
---
You are free to shug that stuff through whatever orifice you find the most pleasing.
---
Oh no, not again... *\*criying intensifies\**
---
I feel like I missed something. Where did the Greek letters come from?
---
i found space invaders in whitessprings
---
I want butt chugging animations! Lol 
---
Most of the forest events
---
i got them as a drop from BIV‚Äôs daily quest
---
This is the smartest, simplest answer to the problem. And it got completely ignored.
---
Nice! For me, Biv seems to be semi-daily. :(
---
he was like that for me but it seems spamming his interact a few times does the trick:)
---
Huh, I have 2 sitting in my stash. I didn't know they were rare.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Lol, Just like Goldilocks well it's better that than Papa bear coming back and finding you in his bed. How was the porridge?
---
Yeah lol it‚Äôs been that long. I was a sophomore when I first played it. 
---
I've heard that this can happen if you have the Plague Walker mutation but I can't find anything that actually verifies that claim so take that with a big grain of salt.
---
Great to hear! Can‚Äôt wait to dive back in after I took a little break :)
---
How would they verify that you are over 50yo?
---
Haven't seen the vendorbot in a while, but if you're running the plague carrier mutation it can activate hostility in normally passive creatures/ robots. Ever accidentally killed a squirrel just by walking close to it, that's plague carrier doing it's job.
---
So we went from 'several' to 'many' and you wont name them but type a paragraph why you don't  need to. 
---
This has happened to me quite a few times
---
How much shotgun ammo ya got?
---
I'm not sure that's worth much, but you'll probably have better luck on /r/fo76bazaar
---
System?
---
Your PSN ?

Please, the forest is the best zone ever, but we players need incentives to go there !
---
This thread must be seen by bethesda right now !
---
He was on one of the main roads near 76. The big one that leaves 76 heading west. Idk if that makes sense.. anyway. He had new lemonade plans like Deezer from FO4. Now I‚Äôm hoping to run into Grahm again. Hope I do.
---
Do you move your C.A.M.P. bench around the build zone?  I found this was messing up mine do now I drop it and don't move it ever.
---
Oh thank you, i didnt really do much with dogmeat in fallout 4 so i didnt know that they had anything for dogs to wear haha
---
I think it's dependant on an in-game timer. I have tried relogging 2-3 days later and the safe is still empty. (busy work week, only logging for vendor caps) 
---
 Might be a combination of real world and I game hours. 
---
Totally not me......
---
Probably smarter to do "foundations" before you get the whole thing in there too, if the building is loaded they can keep an eye on it for stability, then add the vendor in another patch, that kind of thing 
---
I think it‚Äôs more like this; Yes, they released a mostly unfinished and unpolished product. But it‚Äôs not surprising to see an AAA developer continue to support their game. There is still a long way to go but I think now people are stopping being so dramatic about the whole thing. 
---
At least this one didn't  spend ten minutes screaming at Bethesda and another 40 uploading videos and images. 
---
Good theory, we will have to see.....
---
I know what item you mean but I am talking about the actual Vault 76 Jumpsuit we get when we start the game. I tried the one and I don't really like how it looks.. =(
---
You will what?
---
I‚Äôll take the 10mm and the .38
---
I think they gave you time to act when they put in the soft restriction of carry weight +1500. It was like a yellow light flashing "this is coming." Why didn't you sell then? Because people like you think these rules don't really apply to me. (Why would Bethesda even bother if they weren't going to eventually enforce?) 
---
I'm a trader, myself, so I don't get all the bellyaching. I've always been active enough to stay under the limit. Maybe if you'd sold anything you would have, too. 
---
That is awesome ! Dance floor and everything!
---
Collect dirty water from ponds and puddles.  Not pumps or sinks.
---
Spam collect on a pond and you get 100 water in about 10 seconds. 
---
True. It'll be allright in a couple of weeks but now it's ambiguos.
---
This should be a lesson for the next dlc.
---
Also hopefully we won't need to craft alchool non stop everyday till the next dlc.
---
All right
---
I know what item you mean but I am talking about the actual Vault 76 Jumpsuit we get when we start the game. As far as I know they dont sell a cosmetic version in the atom shop.
---
yup, not by me tho: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-vfs2NMCGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-vfs2NMCGM) 
---
Yep, isn‚Äôt it actually canon that people use boiled water due to the rads and what not?
---
My group thinks fast traveling spoils everything more now. Even with salt
---
Power armor and the Alien Blaster? My god please; give me legendaries for them and I'll be happy.
---
I mean yeah, you can do that, but that still creates an unnecessary step where there shouldn't be one. (to say nothing of all of the wood you end up burning through, or the the radiation you get from collecting all of that water)
---
Its making harvesting food kinda pointless 
---
I would love to have camp pets like cats and dogs!
---
I was at constant max caps because of the demand I had for items. It‚Äòs now an issue of my ability to sell items. 
---
Spoil rates are really high currently.  Without good with salt you can expect raw foods to go bad in about 20-30 minutes without even fast traveling.  
---
What level is it?
---
Noticed and it was a pleasant surprise! I mostly get my steel from looted weapons, so yes :) From missile launcher you get 20 if I remember correct.
---
Yea, this is definitely one of those things where if they didn't want us to find it they wouldn't have put it in until the day of its patch. 
---
Wood is so abundant and I use sun kissed.  :)
---
I have a dog mask in my inventory... as in a mask *for* a dog, and I‚Äôve been hoarding it in hopes that it indicates someday soon I‚Äôll get to have a pet dog in game! 
---
How do i add salt to food to preserve it? 
---
Every thing is spoiling much faster even  with maxed "Better with salt " perk, before patch 7 food stuffs would keep a couple days, no they don't last 30 minutes.
---
They drop from scorch beast now. Got the chest piece today from killing a scorch beast
---
Good with salt is a perk that makes things last longer.  
---
That's a perk card. Good with Salt, under Luck.
---
Are small letter set plans expensive too?
---
Sorry, it's a lvl 45.

It‚Äôs a perk card I believe. You don‚Äôt actually add salt. Which would be a good reason to pick up salt.
---
I want them to double server size as with the new update im always hitting full worlds when wanting to play with my friends and 20 minute queues.

---
Brahmin, is now foe
---
&gt; While it's looking less and less likely
---
Why do you say that? 
---
Not as expensive but more than it should be 
---
This is a good game since launch. Yes it was buggy and had terrible marketing and shady business, but the game itself is good. I am still enjoying it since launch.
---
They only do suck shit damage because there's no penetration. The reason melee is so prevenlant is its perks pretty much negate most resistance to it. Ballistics are relevant because they can negate a significant portion of resistance with armor piercing magazines and hardened receivers.
---
Energy guns do not have this benefit. No magazine, no good receivers, absolutely nothing. Why is it even if you build massive ballistic resist, ballistic weapons can still punch through, but you can make energy resist an afterthought and completely make any energy weapon build absolutely irrelevant.
---
Enemies that have higher ballistic resistances still are killed easier with ballistic weapons than with energy weapons because tank killer alone gets rid of a over a third of their ballistic defense.
---
There is never a good reason to use energy weapons beyond role play, and because of that the weapon class suffers. We're almost half a year into game release and an entire weapon class irrefutably sucks unless in one VERY specific scenario where you run a splittered legendary bloody furious laser rifle, in which case it's an OK gun for an all around 5 minute experience until it breaks because splitters still destroy laser weapons. 
---
This wouldn't be a problem if energy weapons had an energy equivalent of a hardened receiver, a decent magazine type, and a perk that negates energy defense. These are all benefits the other archetypes of weapons have.
---
It's different than the other fallout games. But if it seems like something you would enjoy, than go for it
---
Yea I'm a low level of 30 and I help out the real low levels with anything they need because I have a habit of stocking up on many things.

All of the .308 for 200 caps

I hear you man. I suggest trying to contact BGS and see if it's possible to fix your problem. Privacy is a big deal online and they need to understand that. I wish you luck. ü§û

Been looking for toilet plans myself. It seems they‚Äôre not sold at vendors and are random rewards. I‚Äôve been claiming workshops trying to get them myself.
---
Thanks for speaking up
---
I find fog crawlers spawning at the house containing the Overseer‚Äôs journal in Welch. In fact, all five times I‚Äôve seen them it‚Äôs been there. It seems to be a random and weird spawn point. 
---
Yay,are you online now?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that the building is actually the Berkeley Springs Train Station. I always wondered why it wasn‚Äôt like all the other train stations, but I guess this is why. 
---
I feel they would've talked about it by now but I'm still clinging to hope.
---
Ah-ha!  I had read that note but didn't put two and two together.  This is the correct answer.  Thank you very much for this reply.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize how rare they were, I found an X-01 jetpack in the enclave shop the first time I checked it 
---
I‚Äôm surprised no one has said this yet but: it‚Äôs just a typo bug rn. Sheepsquatch haven‚Äôt been added yet 
---
west tek im pretty sure. it‚Äôs in the savage divide near cranberry bog 
---
Maybe not actual canon.  But there are comments in the game that some people think it makes things taste better. 
---
West Tek! Near the satellite array in the savage divide
---
You may think it wasn't working, I thought the same thing. But I find it has always worked but it doesnt fully repair your weapon( maybe upgraded it does?) It just repairs it a portion

I've been trying to get the welding helmet from the ranger district office, but it seems like the flight helmet spawns more frequently there. I scrapped one and kept one, but didn't learn any mods or anything. It looks pretty cool paired with the engineer's suit that I got from an event (I'm trying to get the welding helmet to match it better), I also wear a surgical mask under the helmet.
---
Interesting.  I will be exploring there tonight.  
---
Can you explain the radio slider? I have not seen the option to change it.
---
anyone been able to glitch in?
---
It‚Äôs started to make me regret picking up the herbivore mutation, even my soups go bad fast now
---
Noice! Glad to add this to my mental list =)
---
I know that, I just didn‚Äôt know if this is a bug that shows what is to come. 
---
I'm a level 37, quite often i will make up a few modded out pipe weapons or 10mmand give them to low level players along with ammo and aid. i had high level players help me when I  started, so i feel im paying it forward. 
---
As for me interacting with higher players recently... it seems all they want to do is try to kill me. Had a level 143 toss a grenade into the flatwoods church last night because I was trading with the Bot and wasn't getting out of his way fast enough.
---
had another instance where i went to white springs to watch a nuke drop and got attacked by two high level players while just standing there watching the mushroom 
---
maybe im just having bad luck with high level players recently 
---
Wow it's almost on my camp :O
---
You definitely don‚Äôt ‚Äòneed team mates‚Äô .

Damn, they should just release this stuff already since it's mostly done.
---
Psn pappododo lvl 48
---
Ah gotcha, not a bad point. The way it was worded I was thinking they'd talked about it somewhere and the new info made it less likely. 
---
They say the backpacks are customizable so I'm hoping for a base carry weight and depending on the options you've chosen you can get a weight boost or some specific workbench built in depending on what you want it to do.
---
no you cant. i have the same issue and th emote wheel isnt on the list in the slightest. ben looking for someone to mention this issue for like two months now.
---
I bought it at launch and hardly played it because of the bugs. I realized that there was a new update so I decided to give it another go and I'm so happy I did. I really haven't experienced any bugs since reinstalling and this game is a blast. If you love the other fallout games you'll love this one. The map is by far my favorite of the series!
---
No. He had nothing the past several times, for me. I used to get pretty psyched when I heard his voice in the area. During my first 50 levels I got things that didn't drop  for me from events, like the fusion generator and powered gates. Now I get stuff from vendors and trades.
---
 Yeah. I was kinda bein a dick. But you were bein silly. Sorry. 
---
Yea, keep trying. I‚Äôve gotten the scorpion and bloatfly from breaking down normal syringers

Unrelated to your question, but what are those symbols on your map? I wish there were more location markers such as those displayed on this map. üòè

I would kill her myself just to get rid of the quest and holotapes.

Mostly notes. Hundreds and hundreds of notes. Which I hear is in high demand. So I don‚Äôt really want to destroy them if I can make the time I spent collecting them worth it by selling them or putting them in a vending machine. If I‚Äôm able.

Since you are on PC I will take it upon myself to unite our fellow brothers and sisters on Xbox.

It‚Äôs like helping the beach bobs in ark lol
---
I found 2 sets of them and just gave the spare away, oh well
---
It‚Äôs under sound.  World Radio.  It‚Äôs a volume slider
---
It appears to be max by default.  I checked just now.   Which means I cannot make it louder. :(
---
I ran into a group of enraged fog crawlers just north of Hopewell cavern. Be advised, put your brown pants on before traveling there.
---
He's very quiet for me also, I strggle to hear what he's asking me to do. I'll try and put the music volume back up as you've suggested, see if that helps.
---
So I found the code 748250 on a terminal in the enclave bunker the military wing at one of the work stations. It's not randomly generated like some are saying. The terminal entry mentions remote lab site 1.2 which is North/ North East of Harper's ferry. I remembered this barn door so i went and tried the code and it worked. There were plans inside for operatives underarmor lining.
---
I assume it will.  I know that born survivor will use my supers as it‚Äôs all I carry, and life saving essentially works the same way.
---
Oh I might have not noticed it since everything is already maxed.
---
I've seen him a few times.  The last time, I ended up walking with him.  We met in Morgantown and the servers went down for maintenance about an hour later as we were coming up on the Tyler county fair grounds.  It was a unique experience that I highly recommend.  The dialogue alone is worth it.
---
i stil havent seen them address 76% of what is really important to be finished for the core features the game came to us with. i like having expanded things planned and added but it feels like driving my car without windows on it or something. i need UI/action bar responsiveness fixes and real customization and a lot of streamlining that could be accomplished by modders much more talented than me, even thoyugh i'm gonna create content when possible. 
---
i do have fun playing but it feels weird like i need more air in the tires and have no glass where it should be
---
No.  - Bethseda.  
---
That's definitely west tek. Another good spot to fan mutations is Blackwater Mine. There's a radioactive pond outside and a decon shower right inside, the mile miners give tons of weapons and scrap, and there's several benches in the area to scrap at.
---
As a bonus, it's a very short hike down the hill to the WS train station if you're over encumbered and need to sell or stash stuff. 
---
What i hope is that they stick to certain legendary effects being able to take the place of cards but make it mods not RNG. Like less carry weight but food and water weight is reduced 
---
OP was well stated and thorough without a direct call to nerf yet you say 'did not research' while appearing to have replied without looking at the discussion. Just because counters exist does not mean that it is in balance. Currently this is the singular build that requires specific gear or counters. Unyielding achieving 90% DR, makes some kinda sense. They sacrificed most of their HP to get there. 90% DR for the low cost of standing is ridiculous in the current game state. Nothing else comes close.
---
No thanks I have enough problems with people dropping their camps where mine is without giving people the ability to have more than one camp. If it had to be on the same location and you got to choose which camp to spawn, sure.
---
Oh that could be interesting, and open up more play styles to interesting builds.

God I hope so.....

Or at least mods and ammo

Great update and all... But crashing every 15 minutes or so? Not so great...

Dude same..... ive lost 2 megaslohts (logged back on to find them dead), and a snallygaster. (can we get a F for bruno, snally, and Piece of sloth?)
---
Same problem with me. I also have marsupial btw.
---
I built a 4x6 foundation logged out because I couldn't place my tent then got this error ü§£
---
Yesterday, I found 2 level 25 at the top of the world. I went to them, waving, but they stayed focused on aiming at some super mutants. I decided not to help them : mutants were their level, and they didn't waved back. I though helping them would annoy them more than anything.    
---
That was the story of the "high level player" (only 92) who want to help, but can't ! 
---
There are 7 different vendor "factions", and each has 200 caps that refresh every 20 hours or so.
---
Have you hit them all? There's responder, raider, Whitesprings, Enclave, Harper's Ferry, Watoga train station, and the BOS vendor in the Watoga Super Duper mart.
---
If you're on xbox and don't have them all unlocked I'd be happy to act as a tour guide. 
---
Still waiting for that list I see. It's taking me a while to to write it up for you there are so "many" things to include in it. It may take some time, keep waiting.
---
too late, tse isn't good anymore
---
If they have a dog park, then some asswipes will want to organize dog fights. 
---
'Search' is so powerful. 
---
Xbox thank you though!
---
I went solo the other night and got 8 workshops. The server shutdown for maintenance about 2 hours after the last workshop.
---
I haven't got all of them but can help you with marsupial, carnivore, and speed demon. May have others I'll have to check. If you can't find anyone else to help you out let me know. 
---
I definitely need an "oops sorry" emote. I'm not about that PVP life but when I'm working with someone not on my team for an event and accidentally shoot them instead of the enemy, I PRAY they don't think I was firing at them. Pacifist mode is the only way to stay safe lmao. 
---
If someone is hunting me I and I can‚Äôt defend it‚Äôs new server time. I never lose all my caps.  A better simpler solution for what you are talking about would be to simply disable PVP when not at the workshop
---
Ye its definitely shit
---
Yup. It'll use the "weakest" stim in your inventory, and if super is all you're carrying it'll trigger one of them. 
---
Fermented ones turn into regular ones. So when they "spoil" they just turn into their standard alcohol. yes good with salt is probably messing it up. Fermenters are pretty cheap to craft at camp so its worth building one. Takes about 15-20 mins using that. Also if you get a quest that says drink rum, vodka you can drink anyone in the wild you dont have to craft it first.
---
+karma thanks again!
---
Simple zingers are my fave. I like your style!
---
Which platform are you on?
---
There are seven different factions for vendors. All vendors of a faction share a common pool. Doesn't matter which one you go to as long as they are the same faction they will have the same amount of caps. So you gotta hit each faction. Factions are: responder, raider, whitesprings, enclave, Harper's ferry, brotherhood of steel, and Watoga/Graham/Lemonade dude.
---
Did you milk it?
---
aww so is there no way to get it now?
---
In my Xperia next only Stimpacks work.  Super Stimpaks and Diluted Stimpaks can‚Äôt be used.
---
They should call them legendary servers
---
Thx for the help! 
---
Got 2, but o don‚Äôt even use them. They didn‚Äôt fit my build any I didn‚Äôt like the weapon types enough to change after the nerf.
---
Ok it has to be the good with salt. I dont fast travel and my camps across the map. I didnt want to believe they are forcing you to use the fermenter
---
Seriously!
---
So the only question is if it's a stealth nerf or something that was unintended. Another thing I noticed: fusion cores found in power armor suits are ALWAYS at 25 percent.  That's not a complaint, just a factual observation. 
---
So again, I ask, is it a stealth nerf or an unintended consequence of the patch?
---
Lead belly 3 eliminates rads from food and water, not disease. üôÑ
---
Unless you can pull her out of the nuke zone, your "regular" armor is worthless because till die of rads.
---
If you can get her out of the nuke zone the rad resist doesn't help. 
---
2 words: Saloon Doors.
---
That is all.
---
If you see what appears to be a burnt out van sitting in a junk pile, there is a good bet that its a hermit crab
---
I thought it would have helped with the radiation from the gas and the blasts
---
They are but it only takes a few pieces to craft which makes it less annoying. 
---
Do you have any mods or custom .ini files?
---
What would you say is the best armour combo for fighting the queen out of the nuke zone
---
I can be. What's you IGN so I can look for the friend invite?
---
this doesn't effect what your talking bout in the slightest
---
Well your like 2 months late I guess. PM op and see if he got a fix.
---
That doesn‚Äôt have much to do with what I‚Äôm talking about. This is an example of people filling in the gaps with their imagination 
---
Ive been trying but she ignores all my phone calls! 
---
It's your mods and/or your ini file. There are a while bunch of posts detailing how to fix it. 
---
No worries! My Psn is fakenunchucks. Add me. I'll be on in 10.
---
I agree with you. However that‚Äôs EVERY game now. If I had a nickel for every game this comment applied to, I‚Äôd have a nickel for every online enabled title released in the past 3 years. And contrary to all the big talk on reddit and elsewhere, sales continue unabated. 
---
We lost this war already. I wait 4 months before buying online games at this point. I picked up 76 two weeks ago, been loving it. Skipped all the major issues that way.
---
The footprint is likely too big. The plans aren't locked, and you can still place the locked items and, if you find enough space, maybe even the whole building. Sometimes, the buildings will not place even if they have green outlines,this is a bug.
---
You'll have to start from scratch, B
---
Restart the launcher and log in there. Then the game will launch without prompting to log in.
---
The scorched‚Äôs as is slightly smaller

---
I saw where he got educated in the comments on the different counters to this gear if that‚Äôs what you mean? A post asking for different ways to defeat this gear would‚Äôve gotten a different reply. 
---
He‚Äôs literally asking the devs if they‚Äôre gonna nerf this gear so maybe you‚Äôre the one who didn‚Äôt read it smh. Each build comes with trade offs and with stagger and crits basically negating all the effects of this armor I don‚Äôt see this set as being ridiculous. OP just seems mad that no one will sell him the gear imo. 
---
I found a Russian guy at Whitesprings. I was Lv17 and he was Lv250. He send me the team request, we killed bunch of Ghouls, he help me to level up and loot various legendary items. He didn't touch my junks when I was killed by Ghouls. He crafted me Lv20 set of carryweight leather armor and fully modified Lv50 T-45 pieces. And finally he build a fusion generator, decontamination shower, a nice bed, PArmor Station and bear carpet in my camp.
---
Last time I was up there I accidentally stepped on him and he died so I ate him lol
---
Do you have cable internet? 
---
I actually got what I needed but I will be needing more on my alts. Seriously, thank you!
---
You are correct. I meant to say iron stomach. 
---
Always get those two confused
---
Whats BIV?
---
I have the same problem, from what I know all the BoS armor plans spawn mainly in the toxic valley, so check the events there and hopefully you‚Äôll get it somewhat quickly
---
There's also a waste dump a couple of minutes walk from Blackwater mine. Northeast or East. Usually scorched, sometimes mole miners outside. There's a decon arch there too. Go inside main building to the left, clear it out, take off starched Genes, stand there by the barrels, mutate, starched genes back on, decon. Sever hop and repeat.
---
No. Full power armor for SBQ only. You will die very quickly otherwise. 
---
All good! Well shoot me a message if you ever need any. Safe travels wastelander!
---
I wouldn't recommend a minigun build. I'd recommend a heavy weapons build with Gatling gun as a primary weapon.
---
I have  a heavy buns build. I use two shot Gatling gun for everyday use. 
---
I use an anti-armor .50 cal for the queen.  I also have a  TSE  Cryolator I use on the queen when I have enough ammo for it. Takes time and grinding to make enough Cryo ammo to make it worthwhile.
---
I agree with most of your points I just think you‚Äôre  a little wacky with your conspiracy theories. If we‚Äôre talking micro transactions then yeah I‚Äôm not really a fan, but saying that they‚Äôre conditioning people to lose real world money through the loss of caps is ridiculous. In game currency has been a part of almost every game so what‚Äôs taking them so long to implement your theory?
---
Next time this happens try crouching. I think I got out of it that way a whole ago. Hasnt happened to me recently.
---
He‚Äôs the drunk robot in the basement of the tattoo shop, he‚Äôs basically Bender lol
---
He insults you when ever you hit him
---
I‚Äôm really hoping that is one thing that goes along with legendary crafting or whatever we are really getting.  I‚Äôve held onto a few sweet sub-optimal items just for sentimental reasons but would love to be able to upgrade them.  
---
I‚Äôm a bit over 500 hours with one TSE:  a 15 pump action shotgun, was from a horde event I stumbled into as I recall.  Dropped it in the overseer‚Äôs stash but in hindsight wish I‚Äôd kept it.
---
That sucks. Maybe you should play the game the way it was intended, without mods. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
You can also get Cranberry Moonshine from the Responder Vendor in Flatwoods and I assume others as well. I server hopped for them since they're not always in stock.
---
Not a PA build and don't really like it
---
Buy something
---
Bu-- but
---
How will you get the rich, earthy tones and zippy fizz that only boiled, radioactive river water can provide? You sir are no moonshiner. You're a... Why, you're a hoonshiner!
---
I dunno if that's an insult, but you'd better be offended, my good man.
---
Built a camp there before I noticed him. I still visit every now and again. 
---
No he kills me
---
I did that one fine. But i had another one where i had to complete a critical attack, after drinking rum, no matter how many critical attacks i did it wouldnt register. Logged out, tried it again...success. 
---
  " Have you tried turning off the power, and turning it back on, sir?"
---
Good luck
---
Take it up with your ISP, some have heavy use on the weekends resulting in poor connection. 
---
Really? It is just some junk and a few caps on your head, seems not worth.
---
The problem is that wood armor only comes in 1 star. So rather than not letting 3 star legendaries drop wood armor, maybe just let 2 and 3 star wood armor be a thing.
---
&gt;What would you say is the best armour combo for fighting the queen out of the nuke zone
---
That depends on your weapons and perks. For example, if you've got a bloodied weapon you want unyielding so your damage goes up weekend your health is low. Or, go for sentinel so that when you're standing there smacking the queen you take less damage while not moving. 
---
Also, the green "scream attacks" are considered explosive, so you will want a dense mod on your torso and/or fireproof perk to mitigate that. 
---
They're pretty common plans. I got one as a reward after buying one from the Charleston vendor... Already sold it, though, sorry...
---
Stick with it, though, and you'll get what you want!
---
Where in the toxic valley? Ive been looking for arms and legs for.......ever. I got lucky with the chest plans.
---
Xbox....sry op
---
Neither am I. I only run PA when hauling scrap (excavator) or fighting the scorthbeast Queen. It's almost mandatory when fighting her in the normal zone.
---
No it used to just not work at all. I've always had the level 3 version but I tried it out and it does work now. It's not a huge repair but it is nice and noticeable.
---
That sucks, you will have a very tough time with this fight then. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welding helmet spawns a lot at BOS power plant.  Thunder Mountain control room.

Yes there is a small chance the Grahm on your server is a 3*. From what I know there aren't any special items that spawn on him persee. Just a bigger inventory. Don't know if something causes him to be 3*.

Both a pie and a really interesting ww1 story. If you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs probably worth googling it.

I honestly chalk that up to a missing texture error but as the content isn't out they're not too concerned

I don't understand why everyone is having so much trouble with it, I did the same as you with no problems

I find the comments so far entertaining when you look at the posters flair...

Am I allowed to post links here?

Lol I guess my encounter was a lot different 
---
Being silly by mentioning issues with the new daily quest giver, which also has an impact on the daily challenges?
---
Ok then. I'm not seeking your validation, just looking to bring light upon the issue to make the system better. But thanks for the apology. It's appreciated.
---
Also the fermenter makes it got about 10x as fast and its worth the investment 
---
Sadly Yes

LOL That's awesome

adding the challenges to the map helped me, the dailies are all pretty much quests without rails.

Yeah but the rads kill you quicker than anything else will. You need either a hazmat suit, PA, or a stupid amount of Radx.

sent you an invite too, need 1 moonshine, stuck on 24/25
---
I got the same one on the second day, but I was wearing the Starlet Sniper.
---
Scrap them until you learn it :)
---
My thoughts is that this is actually a PSU issue. Your PC is getting by when not using the GPU but when you load up a game that requires the GPU to pull max draw and the PSU is failing to provide, leading to crash/reboot. 
---
I've been building my own PCs since the early 90s almost every major failure has been traced back to PSU problems. I would test your system with a different PSU before blaming the GPU. If you can't borrow one, order one from somewhere and if the problem recurs you can return for a refund. 
---
That is a great idea!

Walkers - protectrons named after the popular crisps. They drop potato crisps when killed.

Tennants - robot that protect your house and can also be used as fermenters.

Yes, somebody has glitched in an underground tunnel that starts from Harpers Ferry! This is definitily it.
---
Well, I wasn‚Äôt planning on it, but I suppose I could use those caps towards something else. What were you thinking?
---
You can make healing salves if you're really in a pickle, but I'd run with pharma farmer for awhile. You'll get plenty of aid that way. 
---
Any "Horde" events on the map always culminate with a legendary. Also do nuke zones when you see them if you've got the power armor, rad-x, and radaway. Store your junk and don't worry about dying. Uranium Fever usually has 3 legendaries. 
---
You can always do a vendor loop to get 1400 caps per day. There are the 7 factions: responder, raider, Whitesprings, Enclave, Harper's Ferry, Watoga, and BOS (Phoenix in Watoga). Unless I have bulk or chems to sell I usually fight nearby enemies for their weapons to sell. 
---
I'm not so sure. Sentinel will still be better than other choices. Like even if sentinel only works sometimes it's way preferable to more armor durability in the same slot. I think it's just a play-style adjustment that takes some getting used to. Like if I start taking damage I just have to remember to stand still rather than run for cover and in PvP it'll be essentially the same as it is now with the same rampant sentinel hopping. I.E. people jumping and advancing at the same time since sentinel is active while airborne if you're not moving. 
---
I mean call sentinel bad all you want and while it is certainly over-rated you're not going to see me switching to lock-picking gear or reduced fall damage. It's strictly better than other options.
---
This is exactly why i made this post, Those names a brilliant mate! Thank you! The walkers one and Mcvitties have me chuckling though haha.
---
I think it's just rad damage, but I've never paid that much attention because it doesn't seem to do much damage. 
---
Rad-x and power armour or a hazmat suit
---
For fucks sake. Please search the subreddit first before posting something like this. If you had searched, you‚Äôd find out that there are already way too many posts talking about this. There are also a lot of people explaining why this is happening. It‚Äôs due to mods and custom ini files. 
---
Oh yeah, you can milk anything with nipples. 
---
Might have to have your weapon holstered to access it. 
---
Sweet
---
*for science.
---
Before breaking it down. I would try and find people with copies of the plans you don't know that you could get. Once you know everything in the house, if you have room in the new area, should be able to place it. Until you know the plans used in it you won't be able to place. When you break it down the items you don't know will take up storage room until you scrap them or learn and place them again. 
---
Not even needed, a few posts down and there's a topic just like this. 
---
Just events that happen there, try completing them whenever you can
---
Well I'm somewhat low on caps these days but if there's anything in particular u might want to trade for?
---
I wouldn't bother. I only take workshops for challenges, build the two Vault Boy cutouts pointing at it, and ignore it.
---
It's a nice way to get a lotta junk, but eventually you'll be murdered and lose it all. 
---
(It's funny that most people say they only attack for a PvP experience, yet they choose targets up to a hundred levels below them and usually win instantaneously lmao)
---
Events from anywhere in the region
---
Drink whisky and either do a crit or a sneak crit. 
---
I usually just give plans/recipes to low level players. I'm yet to find someone who wouldn't accept those. I think that power leveling can feel like cheating to some so I does not surprise me; that or they just wanted to play together without people bothering them.
---
Yes and it's directly plugged in to the router with no lag anywhere else in the house. It's day and night so even when the kids are asleep. 
---
Well of course that's one way silly goose, but I wasn't sure if they have an RNG pickup out in the wild. 
---
Any suggestions on where to find scrapable ones?
---
So how exactly would thank you look in emote form?
---
Also, Spotted Dick. Occasionally gives you diseases if you get too close. 
---
In fallout 76? If so, the ‚ÄúWes Tek Research Center‚Äù is what comes to mind about this. 
---
I don't know, I haven't had a chance to play yet. But prior to the past it would blow 2 clips and break. It was an amazingly beautiful light show though. 
---
I really hope this update is also the one that makes passive players camps immune to damage. 99% of players are nice but I'm always worried about the 1%.
---
Finding unlegendary ones in the wild is too few and far between. I haven‚Äôt seen any assured dropmomes. Buy the plan (I think one of the vendors offers it) and craft them to scrap them. 
---
That‚Äôs what I did. 
---
Had this happen once three times in a row with orbital strikes.... I spawned in on a horde event that was on a random yao guai spawn. Got smacked during the load and killed twice by my orbitals. Laughing and crying at the same time honestly...
---
I've dropped him some canned dog food before.  he's a good boy.
---
I can play other games with no issues though... I can at this point it's worth a shot is there anyway to tell if it's ISP?
---
Well, I don't think many people are going to play that mode anyway, so don't worry about seeing other players on the map.
---
after you drink the thing, the "text charisma" or "test whatever" part of the quest tells you exactly.  So it will end up saying "buy something"
---
What‚Äôs weird is that I don‚Äôt collect fruit and vegetables, yet have tons of spoiled fruits and veggies. I won‚Äôt complain because it‚Äôs free fertilizer, but it‚Äôs still confusing. 
---
Rad sponge shared with a team.
---
Er 50+ would be starting at 1979 which puts their musically formative years around 1995. If you're just ribbing at their age at least pick an appropriate musical era.
---
I have taken a hiatus from this game, what is survival mode?
---
Or if you have teammates, rad sponge in charisma is very helpful. I don‚Äôt ever go into a nuke zone without it. It heals x amount of rads (depending on what level you have it) on you and any nearby teammates when you get rads. 
---
My camp has been here for awhile. Can't find it in myself to move and leave this little guy alone again. I wish I could take another dog and send him here so he has someone to play with. 
---
I think I found a 2 shot minigun with increased fire rate, I have a tri barrel on it too. Never really thought of it as rare though
---
That was my point of view when I was low, that's why I don't insist ! Totally forgot about the plans, even if I have 10 or more of them always on me, for that use...
---
I described my situation in the original question. Do you have any weapons that would work for what I‚Äôm looking for? I think melee weapons, Mutanf or Troubleshooters, is what would be useful. I was hoping for some more responses to my original question to see if I am on the right track or not.
---
The original trailer showed an Assaultron sitting around the fire with fellow wastelanders
---
The dog helmet exists, so when camp companions are added reddit will still self congratulate themselves for nothing.
---
Ok. Cool. I‚Äôve done this before. Is this the way everyone does it?
---
I thought it was more to do with boiled water not carrying diseases?
---
Does it only have to be shared with a team?
---
New quest ever 20 hours after completion of last quest.
---
Hi, this post is great, it clarified a lot of things. But I have a doubt, I may not have much to do with this, but does the Fallout76Custom.ini thing still work and is still useful? Because all the posts I can find about this are from at least 3 months ago
---
I can‚Äôt do it either. Or cats. And really I‚Äôm sort of on the fence about chickens. 
---
Oh that‚Äôs cool. I isn‚Äôt realize that about sharing it. My wife and I will benefit from that. 
---
Yes you do, you have to interact with him for them to pop up
---
Can you check hours played on PC?
---
Yeah, or sort of lol.  I swear the dude gave me two quests back to back (like within 2 hours) BUT can't replicate it today.  xD
---
Nah bro
---
Yea I'm a bit of a horder too. I've narrow it down to just outfits. I even scrapped my board game collection but I want to collect those again when they open up the displays. 
---
Yes the dog the poster is talking about. I went to show a friend and ran up in power armor accidentally kick the bog and he dies.. whoops
---
I have the same issue and I just did a clean install.
---
I'm ps4 but I'm pretty sure it's the same..when u go to me u screen press challenges and it's the 'played 76 for 7600 hours' challenge ..and it will tell u how many u played 
---
If other online games &amp; browsing the internet work fine with your Xbox then you need to take it up with Bethesda support .... I am sorry for your loss.
---
I have a troubleshooters lever and a mutants ski sword. I use heavy energy weapons and they do quite well against robots. I have other types of weapons too if u knew what u were looking for. 
---
They have only mentioned a few details in their content roadmap. Sounds like it's open PvP with some other undisclosed features. I'm just interested in a different challenge, but who knows it may be just a giant grief-fest. 
---
Especially since some perks require you to be irradiated, right?
---
are you in the year 2029? Is fallout good yet? 
---
If they add wine racks we're going to need a "nice rack" emote
---
I am still trying to find a explosive weapon to be a stand in bolter for my terribly ineffective but fun for me death guard plague marine character....... Sorry to all the strangers I do events with their fancy big guns and hammers and they see me charging a beastie with a sickle I might not be helping much but I am having a really fun time.
---
     
---
I hope they make you start a new character for survival. That would definitely level the playing field. Every body start at level 1 with nothing. I can't wait to see a punch fest at the overseers camp. 
---
Don't worry I'm sure there will be a Sims pets update at some point
---
That's not exactly how it works.
---
Damage taken = ((Damage/DR*0.15)^0.36) * Damage
---
Damage reduction reduces the first damage portion of the equation.
---
Same, and I wasn't even there for it, I was there for dome 2 and spotted it open. 
---
I'm jealous 
---
Can't wait for The Cliffside Rest Area to be visible on the map!
---
Thanks! It was a fun challenge to build. Nice and secluded halfway up in a cliff. A friend today put on neon lights, but I didn't grab a pic yet. 
---
I‚Äôm 50 years old and I screamed like a little girl and woke my wife up when I saw it for the first time. 
---
My stash is so excited to be rid of all the legendary stuff I‚Äôve been hoarding.

I get either Ants or Cave Crickets every time outside Lucky Hole Mine
---
Would be very neat if we could have one regular camp and one "vending camp". I don't really want my home to appear on the map and I think the location I've chosen is very inapropriate for a shop.
---
If you can get it for a good price try it.
---
Honestly you won't know until you try the game.
---
You will get mixed opinions. I've played since release &amp; have enjoyed the majority of it.
---
My poor conscience was taking a real beating until everyone started commenting. That's my first time killing a player outside of them attacking me, or Hunter/hunted, so my knowledge on the social convention in this scenario haha
---
Thanks for clearing it up.
---
Moss town occasionally spawns ticks. It‚Äôs the largest number I‚Äôve found in one location. The downside is a nearby Fissure so you may have to kill a scorchbeast.
---
oh I did, corndog and all.
---
I have a helmet for a dog anyone know who to use it?
---
I've never played 76...but I hear it's very similar to 4. 
---
Cal shocks increase carry capacity right? It never hurts lugging more loot.
---
Dogs had quite a few bits and bobs to play with.
---
Bandannas would go on their neck or various collars could adorn them. Welding goggles could be put over their eyes to give them "doggles". And then armor pieces, helmet and body, to make them tougher (maybe, I don't actually know if it did).
---
I didn't say others were better, but sentinel will be significantly worse in the always active pvp worlds versus the current one. If they are running a bloodied build that requires them being really low hp even a split second without sentinel could be deadly. 
---
I'm not saying it won't be useful at all, just that the idea that it will be completely unmanageable is over selling it. 
---
The only reason sentinel and bloodied builds feel so unbelievably strong right now is because the default pvp experience really tailors to them.
---
Cool. I didn‚Äôt know if people had a better way and I always wondered about that. Thank you so much.
---
I enjoy the game also but only started playing a couple of months ago.   From what I understand the game was in worse shape when it got released.   A lot of bugs and exploits.    Since then the game has been updated a few times and issues are being worked on.
---
So people griped and I think there was a bunch of band wagon people dissing the game because they enjoy being negative, but didn't even play it.
---
Agreed mate. Been having a blast. 
---
The recipe for stimpacks is less than 500 caps. Get the chemist perk and the super duper perk. You can farm tick blood to create blood packs and blood packs are used to create the stimpacks then dilute the stimpacks. You can potentially get 32-64 diluted stimpacks from every 2 tick blood if you are lucky enough to get super duper to proc every time. 
---
You said it best so I‚Äôll quote you on it: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre missing the whole damn point.‚Äù
---
As I said, as well as everyone else, the progression from one piece to another is near nonexistent. It is a series of random shit with no indication as to what it does, something only absolute dumb luck would put together. If there is nothing to work with, there is nothing to solve, no matter the force behind it (the point you missed). Your argument is invalid, not because I disagree with you, but because it simply goes against actual facts. Continuing to equate it to something that requires skill as if critical thinking would solve the nonexistent ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù is completely inane.
---
Aside from that, as I also already stated, nothing would‚Äôve stopped you from creating a group or post to solve it on your own. I‚Äôm sure plenty of people would have joined, until you eventually came to the unanimous realization that there is indeed a vague path to follow and you are doing nothing of meaning or value.
---
Of course there‚Äôs the saying that you can give an infinite amount of monkeys a keyboard and one of them is bound to accidentally write out Shakespeare‚Äôs works in their entirety, but nobody actually gives a fuck because it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
How do you get on different region servers?
---
Geeze guys, why the downvotes here?
---
He said he liked it for a week but then didn't, everyone should have an opinion. He didn't bag the game or anything, just said he hated it after at least trying it - everyone's expectations of this game differ.
---
That‚Äôs my problem - I don‚Äôt really know what I should be looking for. I do 99% melee but there are times you need a gun. I‚Äôm just looking for some tips or suggestions. I know everyone likes different stuff, so it‚Äôs kind of a loaded question.
---
Ghoulish perk comes in handy too, rads heal you, but at best (lvl3?) it's still necessary to use radaway. 
---
Of all of them I feel like shocks are the most useful. Jet pack is fun but having an extra 100 carry weight in this game is QOL
---
Bethesda should add just one thing to this game to make it good. Anything.
---
Check for a custom ini file in: Users/(you)/Documents/my games/Fallout 76 
---
You may need to delete or update it. 
---
Just making a correction here. It's the first time any nuke in your server is launched that doesn't hit a fissure point. The holotape shows up in one of the 3 silo entrances. You don't have to launch the nuke yourself, just as long as one in your server is launched that does not got any fissure point.
---
Do a search in the fo76 sub. 
---
Not sure if you know this but him being below level 50 and you being far above it really messes with the damage and caps. The game has been out a while and people have been making new characters. He could be experienced or either well geared. The right use of vats, chems, perks can mess anyone up.
---
If you are used too doing PvE content mostly the PvP might be a scare at first. There is less room for quality of life perks and revolves more around stacking certain stuff. Like I said the game has been out a while and a lot of people know the mechanics and/or have some PvP oriented gear. You might have not really been prepared, just unlucky. 
---
If PvP seems interesting I wouldn't stop exploring it. It's still something that needs to be fleshed out. Also making a build or collecting gear for it is a nice goal too.
---
There is a large metallic warehouse building near the bus stop. Go around the back, and enter through there.
---
Even then, all the items being server specific, it would really only delay discovery, but it wouldn't actually do anything towards preventing what happened.
---
I've been playing since the beta, and yeah it's improved, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people made it out to be.
---
You stay away from my Brahmin you sick man 
---
It only works with a team. and it works very very well to eliminate radiation with no chem use
---
Not had this yet. Wondering if suppressed sniper rifle while crouched counts.

It's because of those nightmare brewing challenges, Damn game doesn't want you to get sidetracked from making booze for biv.
---
Yeah all the mods work the same way in 76, I would get shocks but I could always pop a psychobuff and drink whiskey to make 40 of the weigh
---
I put every single point into stamina when I played Skyrim. I could carry 800 pounds of gear and Sprint for a solid 5 minutes of actual time before getting tired.
---
Loot is ALWAYS the way to go 
---
I've just been stocking up on canned food till they fix it.   Thought the hotfix they did the other day was supposed to, but I guess not.
---
It was originally so buggy that I was afraid to get in and out of my power armor due to the possibility of it dissapearing.  So it had a rough start lol.  First impressions are lasting :P BUT I think people will get over it.
---
pc?
---
Apperantly Mr handy buzz blades stagger other players and break the sentinel effect. If you repair one to 200% it can do enough damage to kill them in just 3 or 4 ticks.
---
Interesting as you can't use mods or edit ini files, no idea then, never owned a console, good luck with this.
---
Or take the shocks and not get addicted to drugs, enabling you to sell them all for extra caps?
---
I've seen people use a combination of high level perks to walk in a nuke zone naked but it requires you being on a Team and traveling in a tight pack. This method is more for giggles than practicality. 
---
Hit the clinic in Harper's Ferry everyday when you visit the vendor bot
---
The game in general needs bigger servers.  It's hard to go with "everyone you see will be another player" when there's 12 people playing and they're dotted all around the map.
---
I want a teddybear backpack animated like in Fortnite because reasons O\_o
---
How does that work?  Does it stay tamed forever?  Can it be killed by other players?
---
I've played over 700 hours and never experienced this bug people have talked about. I have witnessed this happen on legendary enemies but that is how it's suppose to function with them. 
---
I liked the cable company idea better becasue I was afraid of this but had a feeling... thank you all for your help. I'm afraid of a unresolved ticket but thank you all again.
---
Not out yet 
---
Thanks, it works. 112h
---
I find a random person to team up and I share rad sponge level 3. Never have to use chems. 
---
Whitespring, as them ghouls be very fluid and highly irradiated.
---
What we need is a "base" that actually just loads us into it's own server, and allow us to build that "base" up with lots of cool stuff, lots of room, little limites, etc.
---
Have it so people can visit those if they want, can't damage them, etc.
---
Then on our server we are playing, we can pull up "camps" that can be built up like we do, but no decorations (that's what the "base" is for) and more limits then they currently have.   And of course, it's destroyable.
---
That would help with lag and other crap.
---
May 7
---
If you're in a team you can use the perk that heals rads and share it, along with ghoulish youll constantly heal all your rads and heal your hp every time rads ticks.   I forget what the card is called but youll figure it out :P  
---
I generally just party up with a random stranger at nuke sites if I don't feel like healing rads.
---
Everyone of these post crack me up. 
---
Update is favourite.
---
Lol funny, but Whitespring for sure?
---
It was painful at first, but then he gets more abilities and soon he's destroying shit all on his own.  I can't imagine stomping around Boston without him.
---
U
---
You may have a point, but I'm willing to give it a try just to see if it's a massive shitshow. 
---
This is cropping up so much at the moment.
---
dude that ain't half bad for a backup to a melee build.  nice find.
---
Morgantown is also a good alternative to Whitesprings
---
Ps4 also how do you unlock it?
---
Chunky Green Bois at the Whitesprings. 
---
It cures radiation!  It's like some elixir of life.
---
I hope they get over it, I started it cuz my bro kept sayin it was great. I honestly was willing to play anything else after being on Anthem since launch, and I am so happy I switched
---
On the roadmap it states it's happening on May 7th
---
Certainly I can grab a fair bit of High Rad Fluids so long as you get there early.
---
It's more your armor weight as far as I know. Having Weightless legendary effects, ultra light and/or muffled mods on your armor will make a huge difference.
---
I didn't know it was this detailed
---
Yes. Matter of opinion of course, but personally enjoying it much more NOW than when it launched. It has really improved. Bethesda implements many changes proposed by this Reddit community. Maybe play it on a friend's pc/cosole to take it for a spin, if the money is a major issue. 
---
\*\*\*If you don't like PvP it's very easy to opt out by enabling pacifist mode and not taking workshops.
---
If they ever spawn, that is. I've walked the entire distance of the place many times without encountering enemies outside of specific locations. Shame. Fog crawlers should be all over that place
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
I mean, 25% of the map is playable at max level with an incentive.
---
How is this even possible ?
---
**If on PC.**
---
Stop. No more fucking posts about this. ITS THE MODS AND CUSTOM FILES THAT ARE MESSING WITH THE GAME. 
---
It depends on play style. My "main" pretty much lives in power armor. I don't even carry regular armor with me. That makes a lot of room for extra carry weight. 
---
As sated I have removed the custom file, mods, restored the original, scan and repaired to no effect. I just got done reinstalling the game and it doesn't work.
---
Message unclear, am now a ghoul?
---
Depending on your build regular armor is way better than power armor
---
I find levers to be the best bang for your 45 cal buck. If all you're looking to do is silo runs and/or queen fights then I would suggest using your tse dragon on the queen and and assault/lever rifles for the silos. However, the right melee build would be the best option for silos. Some people melee the queen but I find it boring and annoying having to die all the time
---
Red Ant Lager is +50 carry weight. 
---
I finished and let me say it was intense at first. Especially when my camp was on the other side of the map. This challenge gave a scale on how big Fallout 76‚Äôs map is. And it‚Äôs big. So, yea thanks for the challenge :)
---
I have to say, FO4 got him exactly right.  He even behaved a lot more like a dog than any of the previous canine companions, right down to getting under your feet, randomly sitting down to do nothing and going off on a tangent.  His movements were either a very happy accident of some of the best dog AI I've seen.
---
LOL
---
Never mind, just DC'd.
---
Yeah.  I wanted to take him with me.  It was heartbreaking.
---
Mostly isn't done
---
Oh I forgot to mention when it works the screen will flash and made a sound effect to let you know that you did it correctly.
---
Craft and scrap. Plans requires. 
---
yes funny enough because the large concentration of mobs
---
Oh, is that what it's for? I use it exclusively when griefing.
---
Been playing since day 1 of beta and I feel the same. 
---
Dont forget about the period of time where exiting power armor could perminently ruin your character model
---
My thoughts exactly
---
i love the tesla coils if thats what u mean by shock. the reason why is when in nuke zones and other ppl are killing mobs it guarantees you get a hit off if youre in the aoe
---
I don't kill any of the animals that aren't aggressive, including the frogs.  Just seems a bit pointless when there are a million other things that want to rip you into pieces and then rip the pieces into pieces.
---
yes indeed
---
Tanagra town usually has a Fog Crawler running around. Also if you stay up on top of that highway bridge going south from the power plant instead of going down below it, there is often a van sitting on it, that is actually a hermit crab. Sometimes that guy spawns as a legendary too.
---
do it at your own risks, i got transported to the dev room !
---
Depends on your playstyle, calibrated shocks are almost a must for the extra carry weight. I much prefer Reactive plates or emergency protocols than the stealthboy and jet pack mods as they actually have a larger impact for me and don‚Äôt drain your AP.
---
i think its fun
---
Yeah I can see someone going to the pvp servers getting wrecked and coming back to slap damage servers just to feel better about themselves. 
---
If you wants more details, I let you a comment I've made on a post prior to this one :

nice thank you mate, ill give it a read now!
---
Lol. The old Konami code. I first learned it from Contra
---
I have mine up to 3 and I never have to use radaways. I actually have way too many bc of it hahah. 
---
Let Me In!.png
---
I usually go with vegetable medley or sweet tato, because you can grow most of the ingredients at your camp. And they required a plan to make, so they are probably better, right? 
---
Like someone else said, don't hang around at it between events, you are just a sitting target.
---
Personally I like to take 3 or 4 workshops just to have them to hop around to for free and so I'm not sitting around in one area too long, mainly if I am taking a break.
---
I'm confused. Is this satire? ü§îüßê
---
Ah well that‚Äôs good. There you can get the anti gravity XX3 power armor that allows you to fly around the map. 
---
Rad sponge is the perk you're talking about. 
---
That seems a bit personal...
---
Build your camp around him, free dog.
---
As stated I don't. I've removed all my mods and the custom file. I've even gone as far and reinstalling the game
---
Before using your keycards wait in the basement about 20 seconds to a minute, if someone has already been there the door will open and show you the keys are gone.
---
I did over 20 server hops one night&amp; discovered this in the process.
---
I went to bed disgruntled but got the keys the next day (8 hours later)
---
I think a lot of people mistook legitimate criticism for trashing. If the player base had said nothing I‚Äôm not sure BGS would‚Äôve felt the need to patch it as much as they did. There were definitely posts trashing it but in comparison to the amount of players it wasn‚Äôt too out of proportion. 
---
Praise has been given when patches come out that fix bugs but criticism also exists to encourage certain behavior, and I think the community just wanted a game that didn‚Äôt cause 5 disconnects every playthru. The game is a lot more stable now so it‚Äôs hard for you to understand the bugginess at launch. 
---
Loving the game now even though it has a ways to go yet and can‚Äôt wait for new content at this point but I have 500+ hours into it so I‚Äôm not complaining. 
---
What do you mean? My wendigo build is ruined now.

Also check meat piles.  I find a lot of the nukaflora parts needed in the meat piles if i killed the guy or not.
---
Theyre in the game files but theres currently no way to get them
---
In my post, I even said I deleted this. I performed scan and repair afterwards to generate a new file.
---
It's more stable for some. There has been a ton of change since December, why don't you just scroll the sub, read patch notes for a bit and figure it out yourself ?
---
This is a post I have now at least 6 times. Read it to friends. **THIS** is f-ing hilarious. 
---
I try and drop plans and armor, but half the players look at it, look at me, and then run away in the opposite direction fearing a trap I guess.
---
No, you can't.
---
Anti-grav buildings don't exist in Fallout.
---
Because I'm at work...
---
It's great man
---
Still cannot open my pip boy .... OH SERVER ISSUE ....WHAT A SHOCK . ITS BEEN LIKE THIS FOR 2 Hours. Cannot log in... Anyone else ?
---
It is very annoying. I love the game but any time I play it there is something that s not working, or bugged, or server problem,... üò©üò£üò£ As for Rose quest I did all the hard work to get my syringer ready, and the quest has disappeared. I know of a place where a Yao guai is but I noticed the syringer was no longer in my inventory!!! 
---
That is seriously A-class info üëçüèæ nice one bro will keep this in mind from now on 
---
Only thing I don't like is how few pictures you can take, even though it seems like a key part of the game
---
Quick question. Does intelligence or luck factor in for acquiring mod chance? 
---
Also I'm unable to ads while in first person.
---
Psn name
---
Ohhh i just teleported to real life, wtf am i doing at work....
---
Shrek350
---
How so?
---
I totally get ya, thats why I mentioned Anthem. They are pretty much going through the same thing. If you could stay in game for more than 20 minutes it was a miracle, lots of loot lost, there still is currently no end game content
---
That sucks you work on Sunday.
---
Added difficulty modifier turn off your HUD,
---
I have a marl by my CAMP and it kinda screwed me in the adventure back
---
Side note, Did you know there's a high wire behind the mountainside bed and breakfast... Yeah that's where the Shine took me about to cross the rope (Side Side note the rope is crossable.)
---
Well this bug is solely affecting mod users, so I can only suggest trying once more. If you've already done the fix, try it again?
---
Unless you get double time.
---
Hahah and to the future im in New Zealand monday already
---
They did a hot fix for something else related to ingame timers the other day. May have to wait until Tuesday for the next update. It's a known issue. 
---
Every time I jump on, my guns are unloaded and unfavorited. It's pretty terrible when I immediately get into a fight, and am holding nothing.
---
I have the same problem, my radios also turn off every time I leave and come back in game
---
People wanted a bug free, AAA game right from the start. Whilst I'm a fan of Fallout76 and play it every day, it was a bit of a disappointment that the retail released game was sub par. Throw in hardcore dupers that destabilized servers for their own enjoyment, and people either threw their hands up in anger and complained loudly, or left. I'm incredibly happy with how things have gone, and hope the game stabilizes and grows a large core of dedicated players.  It just took a while to get up to speed.
---
Sure buddy, I'll add you. I'm out of town until Wednesday though. Do you have a mic? 
---
Hmmm might try this game again.
---
Uninstalling Anthem.
---
100 asbestos per day?  For selling?
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs fine. And yes I do have a mic! 
---
If you‚Äôre on XBox and want to meet up we can, we can see if we can work something out.
---
did.. did  you even read what I posted? Or did you just look at the title and just jump on the same wagon as everyone else?
---
Red solo cups? There were a lot at the frat house. 
---
Really I lived at the junk spawn next to the power station for like 2 months and only ever got a death claw with some ants
---
god i hope this is a joke xD
---
Once per week?
---
No, for crafting and scrapping marine armor. It took me hundreds of combat armor arms to unlock all unlockable mods so I'm anticipating the same level of difficulty. 4 asbestos per piece is as low as I can get it.
---
Did it fall from the sky
---
I'm looking forward to it, but it'll be a disaster for sure. Nothing but one shotting weapons/builds everywhere no matter what your build or gear is. Might be amusing for the first week, but as soon as the first legendaries are acquired, forget about fun. 
---
You are dorks!  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòòüòòüòò
---
I'm on right now what's your gamertag?
---
Good to know I'm not the only one affected.
---
Hide
---
I miss having a dog in game...
---
Elder Scrolls Online gives you the ability to have non combat pets and mounts...why the fuck can't we have dogs?!
---
Pulse Mines
---
Indeed. They should rework the way damage is calculated between players before launching a PvP mode.
---
I get the same thing when I get into my power armor at times. I have two weapons and somehow the previous one is removed which causes me to be bare handed.
---
The source I quoted doesn't mention it. But I think the answer is no.
---
It's more balanced aside from tesla rifle. You prolly wont like it if not having a way too powerful weapon bothers you.
---
3 times scan and repair is my limit. Hence why I uninstalled and reinstalled the game. I even bothered with going to nexus and just getting a new custom ini. I just happened to be trying it this last time and noticed in addition to the world falling bug, I can no longer aim while in first person, and Several textures aren't loading such as certain power armors as my ultracite armor is just a hot pink color. The only mod I was using was Better Inventory but I removed that 3 weeks ago in preparation for the mod because I figured something would happen.
---
that‚Äôs literally the game being played (: 
---
What system do you play on?
---
Don't do something that gets you wanted
---
Oh thank you. I was just surprised at no upvotes and misinterpreted. 
---
Sunset Sasparilla is far superior to VIM! or Nuka-Cola
---
I usually put the legendaries I get  from that event in the Flatwoods overseer's cache. 
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I'd also like to know! 
---
"If¬†you or a loved one¬†have been diagnosed with¬†Mesothelioma,¬†you may be entitled to financial compensation."

I use him as battle inspiration. When my companion whimpers i survive...with a PTRS-50
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the best place to farm mutations imo it‚Äôs called Emmet Mountain Disposal Site 
---
If you can take something to increase your AGI it could help with sneaking. 
---
Not totally related, but...  
---
I'm willing to play the game on the PS4, but I'm also a little bit worried about the game state.  
---
I've seen a lot of people complaining about lag while getting into gun fights...   
---
Can anyone confirm if the game got stable on PS4 after all those updates?
---
Yeah, so like he pretty much said. It's a bug. The name is there, but it will be like mole rats or something. It's a creature that will be added later down the line.
---
Can confirm, I fought 4 of them there.
---
Yes I've tried that too but with no success, I've no clue at this point should be a bug n sadly I have to wait until tomorrow for a new quest 
---
Good to know I chose that perk for nothing 
---
I killed one at the golf course awhile ago and it never gave me credit
---
MonkaS 
---
Does the herbivore/carinovore mutations ONLY allow you to eat the respective foods? Or you just get a bonus from them?
---
I'm slowly gathering a bunch of mutations as I go and wondering what happens if you get both.
---
People link them from sites like imgur.
---
That's not balance, nope.   Games should at least *attempt* to be balanced.
---
So they finally put that in?!
---
I didn't think of that but maybe one of my devices can do it. Did you have to set up two macros (on/off)?
---
I'm down, PSN Blst\_hardcheese
---
Yeah I tried that place too. Won't let you complete there. Has to be the cave I think.
---
I have nipples Greg, could you milk me?
---
I had the same interaction yesterday but I didn‚Äôt get killed, I just beat him to death and got a note saying I was insulted, I didn‚Äôt hear him say anything while I was beating him to a pulp, after reading the note I thought he just followed you around and insulted you 
---
Phonograph?
---
Yeah this is unfortunate but if you do something that makes you wanted, someone will come after you.
---
The only thing you could have done is get your junk in your stash. If you can‚Äôt get to a stash box, place your camp wherever you are.
---
I killed one way back and it said completed, then came back i my pipboy the next day acting like I never did it. So I just figured it was weird like the overseer‚Äôs mission and just left it alone. 
---
There's a creature that seems to carry a lot of asbestos, but I can't remember which one. Maybe someone else knows.
---
A lot of fertilizer.......lol. Not really there is a way, but requires moving items once you plant the crops.
---
I'll write it down next time - I just got disconnected from server for the second time today.  
---
I imagine it's because of some mods I had installed a while ago?  I deleted my custom.ini file, but I guess that wasn't enough?  I had missing textures and "Lookup Failed!" errors (particularly at doors leading outside of buildings).
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure where that video was going until the music started. It‚Äôs freaking awesome! Thanks!
---
There was an exploit pre nukashine update that allowed plants and water purifiers to be built on campfires, it's gone now tho
---
I think anglers but i don't think they carry more than a few each. 
---
Will be on in a little while, I will add you :)
---
There used to be a glitch where you could place basically anything on top of a bonfire. It's been patched. 
---
There be some other sneaky ways out there. 
---
That commercial says you can find this shit everywhere
---
useful
---
I like the gun rack on the wall. Been wanting those in game for a while.
---
Yeah! I‚Äôm playing with some other guy rn, join us if you‚Äôd like. Sending a request rn 
---
Only issues I ever have is the random DC or loot not loading from enemies.  I run big guns and the loot issue mainly occurred when I use Gatling plasma and they become a goo pile 
---
tyvm, I'm adding it to my search, Thunder Mtn is my go-to for power cores
---
You should try watching TayTay AKA GreekGodx roleplay GTA
---
Host it or roast it bro.
---
I read his note yesterday and I think he comes up with insults as you do activities or something; I haven't tested this though. Next time I see him I'll try fighting other enemies and see if he mocks my performance or something XD.
---
Looks like a random t posing mannequin spawned in the mountain side 
---
Your character reminds me of a white female Tyrone Biggums from Chappelle Show.
---
I thought it might be cable because your neighbors' usage will also slow down your connection on it. You share a trunk line that only has so much capacity and I figured more people were on it during the weekend, making your connection spottier if not slower. I'm not an expert, so you could be right on thinking it's more of a game issue. Just brainstorming. 
---
Actually several of the underarmours I would  like as the costume that shows. Like the flannel or the BOS officer underarmour.
---
In all honesty most of your stuff is probably not worth anything. Only a minority of legendary weapons are worth anything. The rest are vendor trash.
---
Bethesda will never let you advertise 5000 lbs of gear in whatever setup they do for vending machines. It will probably be linked to the stash. So an 800 lb limit. Additionally you will only have 24 players to sell to at any one time. That means you will have to manually advertise on Reddit and maintain an inventoried list of all your crap. You are going to spend a rediculous amount of time not playing the game for fake money.
---
My camp (on PC) has all the stations, 5 industrial water purifiers, a junk extractor, gourds/corn/tatos/mutfruit (all unlocked and open for everyone to use), and when I take a Workshop I usually put up a sign there saying where my camp is (I81 north of Sunshine Meadows).
---
My atomic shop has nothing! Just the items I purchased... (ps4) Whats the deal?
---
Damn I really wanted those, hope I get that drop.
---
I think *maybe* they put back some of the damage that was taken away from the TSE nerf?  Or, perhaps they just gave a little boost to rifle damage?  Or maybe they fixed a problem with enemies not taking proper damage, because, it seems to be not *quite* as much of a pain in the ass to kill enemies after the update.
---
But, it's strangely inconsistent now.  I guess sometimes when I think I'm getting a Stealth Multiplyer, I'm not - I use "Chameleon" Perk armor.  It's annoying that my gun disappears making it hard to aim - and unless I use a scope, it doesn't help to go into "Aim Mode".  
---
Agreed, should have been supplied with like 2 bottles or something if you need a specific beverage to complete the question.
---
by scrapping marine armor. arms cost the least mats to craft with Armorer

I was wondering this also. Just met him for the first time last night.

Vim! has always been a fun and suprisingoy refreshing alternative to some *other* brands who bully their way into your home.  
---
Are you serious???
---
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW SUNSET SASPARILA‚Ñ¢ IS FAR MORE SUPERIOR THAN VIM AND NUKA COLA COMBINED, IF THERE IS ANYTHING KEEPING TRUE FANS FROM ENJOYING THE GAME IS THAT THERE IS NO SASPARILA‚Ñ¢ IN WEST VIRGINIA!!!!
---
.
---
This public service announcement has been brought to you by folks over at Sunset Sasparila‚Ñ¢.
---
Where did you find them?
---
Be great if they have a local/global text chat to ask around!
---
I don't have a mic, and if they didn't have a mic either no way to find out the required materials.
---
if we had fast travel mats for us and a separate one for team8s that would be nice. i would like to have the ability to ft in my house and have my friends ft where ever i want. 
---
I'm only 26 but I did that too, just a little farther away, where the railroad crosses the road just a bit to the South. There's a junk pile there, and just a bit further there is a river to get all the dirty water you need fast and not have to wait at the pump. I got a bunch of fires around the camp and a radio so if people are near at night they can't miss it. And I have corn mutfruit tatos for adhesive needs, since I need that more than alcohol so far. If only screws grew on trees. And if there is some sort of bio plastic. Never have enough screws or plastic. And I don't have instruments yet, haven't found plans, and the ones the vendor have are so expensive. Like 1200 caps. I have more caps than ever at 900 and still don't have enough.
---
Find it hard to go back though, I'm always so over-encumbered. They really need to make the stash bigger. I don't want to get rid of the rare armor I had at lower levels, or the guns and armor I've found at higher levels than me that seem cool that I don't have much ammo for yet. And all the chems and junk. I've had to sell off loads of it for pennies, cause I need caps and don't have the space. I wish there was a better way to sell the variety of stuff that you can with vendors that you don't have to hike across the map for that actually pays.
---
I actually agree with this.  But only like with warcraft or other games, access is given after you complete a quest or object.  
---
So until you do x ( launch a nuke)  you are "stage 1" of the world.  Nuke causes sbq to emerge, causes plague to intensify.
---
"Stage 2" servers, forest is level 40 min, enemies go up to 80. Char level 50+ only. Lasts until you finiah next part of mainquest.  All side queats that have next parts unlocked, new questlines started.  Ends with raid on glassed cavern to seal fiasure prime.  Once done, go to stage 3. Lvl 70+. New threat, etc.
---
You can go back to previous stage at any time, but locked at a max level, weapons and armor reduced to that stages max.
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one. I just finished it again. I'll let you know if it comes back again.
---
My grandmas attic
---
Here's my second attempt.  I ended up way further away from my C.A.M.P. this time, and died a few times on the way. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYDpGTN0Opg&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYDpGTN0Opg&amp;feature=youtu.be) 
---
I do it for 100.
---
&gt;but I refuse cuz I love the discovery and exploration
---
That right there is one of the big disconnects between the "HaRdCoRe FaLlOuT FaNz" and people who enjoy the game. Where you enjoy the exploration and discovery aspects, a handful of sour pusses instead just cried about how the game doesn't have role playing elements and interactions with NPCs and are still just dwelling on that instead of giving the game an honest shot with an open mind. 
---
Its not for everyone, it was pretty rough at launch, and it certainly isn't fallout 5, but the outrage is just salty people who are blowing everything they can out of proportion. 
---
The problem here, is that you pick locked an air drop that was called in by another player. It's called stealing, and pick locking a players camp gets you wanted too. Make sure to always stash your junk items at gas stations and train stations. 
---
I can make a blueprint but it also grabs the foundation below it as well and I can't place it anywhere. I can still pick up the rug with the crops attached, but I am afraid to move it outside only to possibly find out I can't blueprint or move it back again. 
---
Just put a storage container, not stash, and write "donations welcome" over it in neon
---
My atomic shop doesn't even get the grayed out boxes... just shows me items I bought. =(   Is there some button I push to allow me to see all items? (PS4) 
---
Fast travel mats for CAMPS like workshops/FO4 has!
---
Agreed. When I go to low lvl areas, that's when I use those ridiculous weapons we all wish were stronger. I will bust out the double bar, flaming chainsaw or flaming pitchfork. 
---
Thanks for the offer! On Xbox though
---
Based off of Far Harbor, I have high hopes for the future of dialogue in the Fallout franchise. 
---
Yep. Just finished it, then logged out. It's back up on my list of misc quests. Definitely bugged.
---
Right near there there‚Äôs another set in the army train in the train yard and another in the intel base under mama dolces
---
Ughhh. Such a weird one to be bugged lmao
---
I don't know where to find a stash box right now close to flatwoods.
---
It was my team mate
---
It's the civil war reanactor he is usually dead but during the early days of this game alot of things did the T pose. 
---
I was once propositioned by a hot co-worker to advertise the merits of Nuka Cola on social media. I however, am a man of integrity. My values are steadfast and enduring, as timeless as the iconic taste of Nuka Cola, available in multiple flavors including cherry
---
I‚Äôm feeling lazy so you got a deal. Hivemind56 is my tag. 
---
I'm assuming.... It says I've already entered a correct code. Doesn't let me access the key pad.
---
Or wait... Am I dumb? Would it have let me launch with just the key card? IDK
---
Idk why a level 188 needs my 10 caps. I didn't know it would make me wanted because my team mate who called it in also had to pick the lock
---
When I was trying to get the Brotherhood power armor paint scheme's from doing 'Forbidden Knowledge', Insult Bot appeared at Camp Venture, I thought it was weird üòÉ
---
We really dont know what happened to other countries so it would be interesting to get a non US fallout
---
I didn't know that worked that way. My team mate who called it in had to pick it as well and didn't get wanted.
---
The only major issue I had on with it early on were small bugs, namely quests not being able to be finished.
---
Other than that I had a blast up until the point where all I had left to do was farm the queen.
---
But at that point it was physically impossible and improbable to kill her because of the excess of enemies and decrease in FPS.
---
Once they fixed that I realized it would take 50+ kills to get a single good item that‚Äôs not a duplicate.
---
So I did 200 queen kills, got 5 serum recipes, spent another 125k caps on the rest of the recipes, people started duping them. I beat the game only to have people 2 days later do the same with 1/100 the effort I put in.
---
It acts like a daily. Or hourly. 
---
I‚Äôve got a few [PS4]. Looking to buy any?  If you just need a handful to stabilize some flux and make a _____, I might be able to help
---
Thanks for the info, was able to find one from Macs shack.
---
I just minded the heavy weapon durability and ammo consumption
---
RoboBrain was unintentionally receiving Sentry Bot drops.  
---
Idk why he needed my 10 caps so bad. If that's what the community has become I'm glad this game almost killed it.
---
It was explosive so he shot where ever I hid.
---
They put out a game type they‚Äôve never done before.  I cut them slack.  Being in the software business I see it regularly.  Your focus groups never truly match the whims of who ends up being your users.  
---
Yes, the beta should‚Äôve been longer, but it‚Äôs not like they are polishing a turd, at least not to us casuals.  There is a diamond in there.  
---
Bethesda will make their money back, even if it‚Äôs not in 76.  
---
Think about all of these lessons applied to Starfield or Elder Scrolls.  Ooooooo!
---
What ammo &amp; system?
---
It‚Äôs not needing your caps, it‚Äôs literally how the game is supposed to be played lmao 
---
I have a flamethrower and some mutant hound meat...road side bbq should be no problem. 
---
No, because the button order for turning it on and off are the same, so just one macro works. 
---
If he picked it first it would be open, and you should be able to loot it, but if he took everything it would be empty. These are instantiated to the player. He called it in, it's his. 
---
I‚Äôm wondering if this is mob specific and it‚Äôs not saying what to hit. I did the above on my mule and it worked. I did it on my main and it didn‚Äôt work. 
---
good luck to you ! 
---
I'm willing to bet money you're one of those toxic players too then. All I hear for those people is hate. I'm level 5. He's 188. Im learning ropes. He has an explosive shotgun. It isn't fair. I can't win.
---
That was truly beautiful.
---
Can the SBQ drop plans? If so it may have been her 
---
If you have one, then foods from the other group restore zero hunger, but their effects work (Example: +carry weight from grilled radstag still works with herbivore)
---
hahaha so sorry this happened to you. i try to always go home to my base/camp and then log off, and never gave this a thought, but now I'm going to try to make it a point to do so, just in case someone is sleeping in my bed. ;)
---
I know that haha, I was just saying that I had presumed it to be some really rare, high level creature when it gets introduced. Something like the Mothman, Flatwoods monster, or Grafton monster. However, if multiple are going to be attaching our workshops, I would assume that they will he closer to mole rats, scorched, super mutants etc, which currently over run workshops. 
---
I didn't know that. I thought being on his team ment we both got it. I even gave him the holo.
---
Thats a ActionAbeActionFigure. Beard is missing though 
---
Scorchbeasts can be tough around that level. Strange full regen though....At higher level they're annoying. Actual flying vermin. Wouldn't bother farming them till after level 50 when you need those few last exclusive plans. Also enforcer even tier 1 is the way my friend. Good luck next time.
---
Yeah toxic? For playing the game how the developers want it? Did he keep killing you after? Call you names? Send hate mail? It just seems to me you‚Äôre upset because of your own actions making you wanted.  Regardless of if you knew or not, not knowing isn‚Äôt an excuse to be salty 
---
Why?  What value does that add? Just effort for semantics 
---
Whereabouts was it? I‚Äôve got my CAMP set up under the bridge by Harper‚Äôs Ferry - hope it wasn‚Äôt me!
---
Also you get the occasional Alpha Matriarch DC. 
---
There‚Äôs a hermit crab that spawns somewhat reliably in a patch of woods between Watoga and the steakhouse as well. I‚Äôll check it out and try to give you a more exact location when I‚Äôm back on 
---
Ahh, glad someone posted this. I thought it was just me. Hopefully it's something unintentional, and they'll fix it.
---
Why isnt there a "no mic" emote?
---
When I logged in earlier I appeared inside a base but none of the walls or anything were there. It was just a big mess of furniture and turrets floating in midair. As soon as I stepped outside of the bounds, it all popped in.
---
Ahhhhh.  That makes more sense. 
---
I was having trouble with audio all the time, but I'm on PS4. We disconnected the controllers, and then reconnected them. Still intermittently had a problem. Finally figured out I was too far away from the console, so the Bluetooth between the controller/headphones and console wasn't working well. I moved closer to the console and haven't had any problems since. I know exactly zero about Xbox, but maybe there's a similar fix for you?
---
So if I scrap the marine armor enough I will unlock it? I don't need to learn the plan for it?
---
800c
---
If nuked properly whitesprings als has quite a few ghouls on the road SW nice for rotations.
---
This game needs animal companions
---
haha love this comment
---
I found, and lost, two back in the days mods were autoscrapping. I've found it three more times since then. Mounted it finally, then sold one, then kept the last as a spare after I started losing random weapons and pieces of armor between logins.
---
Based on his profile looks like he‚Äôs on PC and selling 5mm, now cut me in on the profits!
---
My  recipes were all different  than yours. Last recipe was a mixed drink, tick blood tequila sunrise. You need the tequila to make it though. I don't  have the tequila recipe. 
---
My camp desperately needs this. 8/10 times I fast travel to my CAMP, I spawn deep in the lake nearby. Not fun, and not fun for potential visitors!
---
The storage containers are linked to your own stash.
---
Why not have one that says donations on top like the stash box.
---
I liked the idea from Skyrim for the greybeards.
---
You can dump as much as you‚Äôd like, 1 paper bag at a time
---
Hate to say 'pics or it didn't happen' but how can we trust someone who goes by covertdistress? ;)
---
no plan according to my records lol
---
Very unclear, I woke up in a cart with some Nordic guy.
---
You‚Äôre such a classy guy man, I don‚Äôt think calling me toxic then insulting me is helping your point in anyway , but have a good day my man (: 
---
Yay no more need to come on Reddit market sub if thwy implement vending right it will be a huge win for the community woo
---
Your local DMV
---
Congrats! I got my first a couple weeks ago in Watoga. Well, not really my first, the broken machine in Nuka world has that honor.
---
Him how many times do you have to scrap before you unlock it
---
My Xbox is ancient and acting up. I may be back on later. Sorry bud. 
---
Correct, once you've entered a code in a silo, you don't have to re-enter that code for up to several days. I'm not sure if it's something like 72 hours, or if it resets when the code resets. I've launched a ton of nukes, and I feel like it the reset on the pad is more frequent than the reset on the code, but I haven't been able to prove it conclusively yet.
---
Oh yeah, that's correct. Thanks
---
One thing I just tried was what he said above but altered it to match what my alt did. I got the rum from white springs, went to that center area with the cars and brick building that spawns ghouls. I let it hit me first, used escape artist and killed it. It registered for me that way. I‚Äôm not sure if it will work for you but perhaps it will. I use unyielding armor, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs stat or card based for the bug. 
---
I'm on pc and I have a lot of 5mm shotgun shells  .38 fusion cells 
---
I'm sure he's fetching you the best weapon in the game,  cause he's the bestest boy! 
---
Because its the most valuble thing in your base
---
griefing
---
Just store the arch whenever you‚Äôre not there

When you load into Harper's Ferry, turn around and walk over the bridge and around the the right side of the hill in front of you. Work your way to the top and on the rocks overlooking the bridge you'll find 2 dead people in lawn chairs. There is always a dog there that never leaves. Thinking about relocating there...üëç 
---
Do you need flux to repair it? I haven‚Äôt built one but that seems like a dick/troll move since flux are hardish to come by. 
---
so I'm in the place for key 2 didn't turn up and I was the one who opened the door. I then server hoped and picked the lock again and it's still not there on Xbox one
---
Something is definitely up. I cook corn soup, for a 4 hour session 35-40 would be enough. Now it‚Äôs like 70.....
---
I was also not in a group both times. I really hope this helps. Please let me know if it does work. I know several people would like to know the criteria for the fix. 
---
Snallygasters! 3 of them spawn all the time at Toxic Larry‚Äôs Meat n Go

I've played 1,2,3, NV, 4,76. Your gatekeeping isn't going to help you. You broke the rules. Getting mad on Reddit isn't doing anything other than making you look like a whiner. If you're past max caps, and 4000 over the weight limit, it's on you. 
---
OP is right, you're toxic. You're not here to be helpful, you're just here to push his buttons. Move on, and grow up.
---
You should visit the farm near Momanga. Has mounted cat heads all over the wall.
---
It follows the main quest line.  Until more is added we won‚Äôt find her journals to follow (or as she begins tracking us).  
---
Lmao it‚Äôs how the game is supposed to played bud 
---
It never stops!
---
I disabled it after doing it 4 times.
---
Also, could have been a normal guy who was just checking out your base when the shower removed a mutation? Their own fault on that one, but perhaps it was a misplaced moment of retaliation. 
---
You keep saying that like you're a broken record or something. Loser.
---
Definitely share it and stay somewhat grouped. You won't need rad-x or radaway. It is glorious. 
---
Trolls that go around destroying houses really grind my gears.  So I've started keeping track of ones i catch. I'll stalk them on the map, I'll find your house. Sometimes they're really nice, which is ironic because you sure had no issues wrecking mine. 
---
Depending on how much of a dick you were will determine the amount of orbital strikes are coming to your house faster than you can tuck tail and run.
---
I take out any wanted player, regardless of level. I normally don‚Äôt take their junk though, at level 105 I don‚Äôt really need it.....
---
Are you doing a poop, having a stroke or ....other?
---
Surprising?
---
I‚Äôm down, what‚Äôs your PSN?
---
I can usually get a Fog Crawler to spawn near Tanagra Town
---
To be fair you and I just joined in after the games seventh patch since release (got my copy about a week ago). It was probably as buggy as people said it was. I'm glad I waited to get it or I might have been one of the disgruntled players never to return.  
---
I met him yesterday and he just kept following me. Met him again today and smashed him because he annoyed the shit out of me. Didn't see any notes about being insulted, but there was a lot going on, so maybe I missed it.
---
This. If you get there late check the piles. You‚Äôll often still get a few glowing mass, hardened mass or any of the other irradiated flux ingredients. 
---
Ah thanks. I'll check it out. 
---
How many times do you have to scrap it also turns out you can't build it and scrap it to get anything has to be something you get or buy I guess
---
The super mutants appearing (and disappearing) from the ground where hilarious!
---
If it's not completely destroyed, then picking it up and placing it down will fully fix it. If it's completely destroyed you either use flux to fix it  (that is a yes to your question if repairing by conventional means) or relocate your base by like an inch or so and everything is fixed at the cost of caps. I don't know if server hopping has any affect.
---
Yeah thats the part that bugs me. He had fully modded xo1 and a explosive shotgun. He just did it to be a douche
---
Wish I had that issue. I get these quests when I'm nowhere near Camden Park. Drives me nuts.
---
Undercutting doesn't help the market or yourself.
---
Its for arms
---
Yeah you need flux. Just makes no sense to just destroy the the thing. Once you know how to farm flux is easy to fix it was just annoying to have someone attack my base. Lvl 210 and this is somehow my first  base attack. 370 hours in
---
I think brawling is only for arms 
---
It adds it to your inventory automatically but it just explains what he is, where he came from, and how he works
---
Why did it give it to me for scraping legs.
---
I'm here for the 5 o'clock free crack give away
---
Its weird ive gotten arm mods for leg scrapping as well

Thanks for the help I've submitted a ticket and it's being passed up the line at Bethesda at this point. 
---
Nifty, thanks. :)
---
Now I.am sad face... Back to the silo!
---
I put my camp to give him a home. But let's be honest. Either its a ghost dog or like the great great great great great great granddog of that couples dog. No way he's prewar.
---
Have you ever played any other fallout game?  This is any other fallout game stripped down to the bone and made a thousand times more buggy. If you like this game go pickup fallout 4 or NV or something and realize how bad this game is in comparison. This could have been like, a bad DLC to fallout 4 for 20 bucks and it'd have been okay, as a 60 dollar release it's pathetic compared to the other games in the series. It's got like 5% of the content. 
---
I'm on PC. I did the same, wait for the bar to fill. Hit Y, shot, popped up registered a critical hit on X enemy, but it would never register for the quest.
---
I have only  had one mission from him as yet. Also having issues with  vendors resetting, and food spoiling MUCH faster. And come to think of it, some of my ready-to-harvest food won't harvest. I'm thinking some bugging is going on since the update.
---
If you become wanted again get your team mate to kill you &amp; guard your junk till you respawn.
---
Some people rp as bounty hunters and will come after you as soon as you become wanted regardless of your level.
---
Admittedly taking your junk at that level wasn't necessary.
---
*how many different mutations are there?*  ftfy
---
'Can Do' is also under Luck and I would recommend it if you're not inclined to be cooking that often, or aren't able to make frequent stops at cooking stations. Searching through the plentiful trash cans of Appalachia provides me with a bounty of food that never spoils. And you can switch the perk back out as soon as you're done dumpster diving.
---
Same thing happened with combat armor legs I crafted 80 of them and started scraping them game said I unlocked bos mod but I don‚Äôt have that either.
---
I have played every fall out from 3, NV, 4 etc. etc.
---
so far this is the only one Ive actually enjoyed playing
---
Yeah man like calling people names is soooooo nice (: it‚Äôs really how the game is played, OP is a level 52 you can see from his post history 
---
Add spoiled milk to the list.
---
As I told another person, I'm unsure. I've had the hat since before the event, months ago. I most likely got it from an event but I honestly cant remember.
---
Yeah I think they broke it like nukes how some people can access and others can't.
---
Nuka~Cola for the WIN!! Because that's what's actually on the t-shirt I'm wearing today.
---
Ywah that shouldn't happen at least i domt think its a plan learn only 
---
&gt; fusion cores found in power armor suits are ALWAYS at 25 percent.
---
Most are, true. I found one yesterday inside Emmett Mountain Disposal Site that had 68%. So not all hope is lost, I guess.
---
Sorry to hear that would of tossed you double what you lost.
---
What are you talking about?
---
is that why that train station is inaccessible?
---
Got my first one today as well! I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn‚Äôt imagining it, since ghouls came in right as i clicked it.
---
I had a great experience earlier where i had to enter the code again, but not the KEYCARD. 
---
I'll take that over a code any day!
---
Until someone shoots your dog and you can't do shit about it
---
u/LadyDevaan pls tell this will hppn
---
I would love a 50 plus server that set the whole map to work like the eastern side. Would make the game much more interesting 
---
Yeah beers, whiskeys etc. Things that were already in the game don't become vintage. Just fermented, then normal. But some of the alcohols like tick blood tequila becomes vintage after its normal. Just look for the condition to know if it can age another step
---
I wanted to put a container outside that I could leave water and a few stims in for anyone who happens through my friendly camp, but clearly am not smart enough to figure out how to do that.
---
I completely agree, they should make everyone start at level 1. Make you experience the game again. Just like Fallout 4s Survival mode, adding an edge of harshness to the wastes 
---
I must have a bug because I block at 18
---
Bloodleaf, soot flower (not toxic), and boiled water
---
Hate to say but even had you killed it it would have 90% chance have been a waste. Until you can kill them in a few shots I would avoid fighting them all together if you can
---
I was referring to the guy that undercut your offer on your post by 50 caps. I dont know why it didn't respond under him when i replied to the comment.
---
I've got a taphouse and lounge in Helvetia, stop by. There's a giant neon sign on top, you cant miss it
---
From what I've been reading here some base attackers try to instigate PvP this way. (I think they also like trashing people's stuff though.)
---
I wish they weren't deleted when you uninstall the game as well. Before I got my 4tb external hdd I ran out of room and had to delete the game for a week and lost so many great photos.
---
Step 1. place down a rug over dirt. Step 2. place down plant on rug and dirt at same time so that it registered as "on" the rug (sometimes you can get multiple, if it's somethig with roots like mutfruit you may need to use two rugs.. Step 3. move rug with plant on it.
---
Works with water purifiers, and it is also a way to get your brahmin indoors. Just be aware some items like the brahmin and mutifruit create large -no build fields, 
---
It's tricky sometimes and it can become an exercise in frustration. If it works in one area with sloped or flatter dirt then find a way to make a mental note of it to go back to.
---
I literally just saw a dude whose character model was stretched because he was in power armor. I got BETA flashbacks.
---
thats wrong, craft and scrap lots of them, the chances to unlock are very low.
---
There was a vim! Paint plan in the game but they removed it
---
The worst part is sometimes they explode sometimes they dont sometimes they wait sometimes it happens as soon as they die....
---
Yeah this would be great. I'd be happy with a little pot that you would have to carry to be able to cook where you wanted.
---
It does, I gathered all my ingredients to brew Nukashine, fast travelled to the bar and most of it had gone off when I spawned there.
---
&gt; Also does class freak help with the negative effects of chems for healing factor or the minus HP for adrenal factor? Want to know before I drink those serums. 
---
It does.
---
I'm doing a full playthrough, think you should follow suit
---
If the robot exploded because of it's own internal parts wouldn't it stay in one spot because the explosion would be shot out in all directions? 
---
The start was ruff but now it's amazing and with the community and the devs working AND talking as one it's going to get even better. Anyone whis new or old and wants to chill hit me up (PS4-DATCATINDAHAT)
---
I agree with pheakelmatters (LOL@username), where you change your audio settings in the options menu, you should be able to adjust the volume for the radio up/down, all the way down to muted.
---
Yes we also need gift and lol asap. I'd love some that signaled that you wanted to do events, launce a nuke, etc
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half 
---
I wish vats wouldn't target them until they start moving around. Ruins the surprise. Felt the same way about Swan in fo4.
---
But if I buy one or get one through an event or Quest chances are way higher right?
---
Ah damn, well I'm sure someone on xbox will toss you some stimpacks at least lol.  I had that issue early on, just asked some random guy at a train station and he gave me like 30 :P
---
It's worth it. I use a set of sent/assassin gear. I'm a stealth sniper and rarely pvp but if I get into a fight I win 9 times out of 10. I have my arm hot keyed and switch between a chameleon arm and the sent one as needed
---
Today You Learned why you're unable to keep your CAMP where you placed it next to this good boy doggo...
---
Seriously though, thank you all for adopting this poor pup and giving him furever homes!
---
It wasn't an exploit, the "area" on campfire was tagged as ground, so you could potentially build anything that requires that type of area. Sad its gone ;/ 
---
Thanks for the idea. My camp is on a junk heap just east of there
---
I know seriously. 12 years of therapy down the hole.
---
I'm sure he planned to level the base but you left the server
---
Good to know. I'll go back and try some of them again. Although Feed the People really irritated me, so I'm not sure I'll try that one again. 
---
Are you here for the goods? 
---
It's the best part of the fallout 76 world imo. I love logging on and taking a workshop or two and making them decked out for all the noobs to use even get some higher ones come by and help me help them. It's what makes the world alive for me. 
---
You should clarify if you're wanting to go bloodied ranged or bloodied melee also.  I think the builds are more about the gear and mutations than the perks though.  For instanced melee can get a ton of damage out of unyielding gear (that buffs your stats at low HP).  Also finding a bloodied weapon might take a bit, if you havent already.  Though you could trade for one.
---
no thats nonsense
---
There is also one similarly tagged on the big bridge in the forest area.
---
I get the feeling any permanently dead radstag has been mislabelled.
---
I just got a two shot one. Looking for mods now.
---
I want to see a global market. One where you can look for items not on your server. Kinda like runescape did. It seems like it will be a waste if you are limited to selling or buying items only from your server. At least weapons and armor. 
---
You can't do that, sadly.  
---
You can not have herbivore and carnivore at same time. So you can only have 18. 
---
So Beth enabled all of these to drop from the Forbidden Knowledge quest finally?
---
Well, at least now I know it isn't me then.
---
I am running shotgun and melee
---
Same here but it gives me caps and wedigo cave is a decent farm spot so I keep doing it lol
---
That's happened to me many times but yeah I wasn't sure if he was saying he would pay me 100 or if he was saying that he paints others for 100
---
Are you anti-semantic or something?
---
if they put in different variants of pets i want us to be able to submit to bethesda dog skins and models  that can get patched in over time
---
Get adrenal reaction mutation. Nerd Rage, Radicool, Bloody mess, Adrenaline is what I have on mine. The other perks are quality of life perks, and heavy/rifle damage.
---
I don't think so. The arch  is in a building of it own. I figure if he was going to level it he would just go in shooting and not even notice it there. 
---
So it takes forever no matter what
---
The reason it got dashed was because the vast majority, gaming journalists and youtubers went into the game wanting to hate it.
---
They never have it a chance and from the moment it was unveiled they wanted it to be an absolute failure. How dare Bethesda make a risky game that‚Äôs actually fun and huge.
---
Sadly, now the haters have moved onto Anthem which is also a fantastic game in its own right but it is t a new Mass Effect game so it HAS TO fail.
---
Yep lol
---
I have been playing regularly since launch and I have somehow never run across him. Is there some sort of trick to finding him?
---
I once escaped a mob of ghouls at WS by climbing to the top floor of a very very tall camp built hanging off the side of a cliff. You know that technique before last patch that allowed 8 floors in your camp. I am plinking the ghouls in the head very slowly grinding them down (I am like lvl32 at this point) and the dude logs out.
---
I faaaaaaaaaaallllllll all the way to the ground where my limbs are crippled and have about 1.5 seconds before the ghoul mobs gets revenge.
---
5% of the content?
---
Are you actually ducking stupid? The game world is about 5x bigger than FO4 and full of locations, lore and enemies etc.
---
There‚Äôs also a large number of quests, events and dailies. 
---
Shush now thot
---
I have my base on the toxic river on xbox and bed are on third floor next to the blue atom shop door of my private room.
---
Call me old fashioned, but I think games should release in a mostly functional state. I couldn‚Äôt even finish a queen fight until after patch 2 because of how bad the crashes and DCs were.
---
Add me I usually have like 12 people in one server we all play together as a team and keep the peace in the world. Ps4 datcatindahat
---
Don't rush, explore each biome a considerable amount before you venture to the next, and do events for recipers/plans. 
---
It would be great if that is how you would find your pet. If you stumble onto one and get it or feed it. And then it would decide to follow you home or not on how you treat it. 
---
personnaly i would make PA good for DR/Rad Resist but make normal armor start with 2x or 3x as much health
---
I know a few people that will hunt for generators and stuff like that first and destroy a base from the inside out but who in knows with people.  They could just be wanting to destroy a shower
---
Here‚Äôs one tip, scrap weapons as often as possible. You can get the blueprints for weapon mods way easier that way 
---
Glad I'm not alone. I figured after the 3 nuke holotapes it would go away and come back once the story picked back up. Guess I'll turn it off for now till we get more content to it. Ty 
---
Yes. We‚Äôre not sure about sentinel though.
---
My animal friend is maxed and my charisma is 6, will I be able to tame a critter?
---
Perk that cost 5 Charisma points: you have a dog.
---
(Would be interesting)
---
&gt;NO RUMORS OR LEAKS WITHOUT VERIFIED EVIDENCE
---
Good question and the truth is I am not sure.  The latest patch slowed down the rate of fire for heavy weapons.  I haven't used my tri-barrel minigun since the patch so I am not sure.   Sounds like you really like the gun so maybe you should give it a go. If supplying it with ammo turns out to be too much work, then you can always go the Gatling gun route. 
---
Agreed, griefing is extremely rare in this game and I think it happening occasionally makes the game interesting I‚Äôm level 200 and have had like 3 instances of people attacking my camp and its in a high traffic area.
---
Darn. Wasted a bunch of corn and razorgrain. 
---
Had the same issue.  You will have another .ini file that needs deleted. Uninsalling and reinstalling doesn't fix it. It will be in my documents.  It should be in c - user - (folder with user name) - documents - my games - fallout 76. Even if you have the game installed on a different drive you will have a file there. For some reason when using that path i wasn't seeing the fallout 76 folder. I was able to if I went to the side and selected documents under this PC. 
---
Thanks mate, good to know. I have a feeling planter boxes or dirt plots will be added soon. ü§û 
---
Let me just connect my NES controller to my PS4
---
I finally got keycard 02 but can't find keycard 01

I'll say it so the other guy doesn't need to

Bust out that 3* lead pipe, remove armor, strip down to your underwear and don‚Äôt take any food or water with you.
