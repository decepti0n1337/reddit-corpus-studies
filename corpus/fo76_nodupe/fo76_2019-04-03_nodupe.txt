I got two hacker and picklock 1 for sure. Along with another 1 star only perk. I wish I had recorded that because it does happen, even if it shouldn't. 
---
I think there should be a public message board for players to communicate. I always have excess ammo and stims etc that i dont need and id rather give tgem away to lower levels to help them rather than sell. Gave away an All Rise to a lvl 3 player. Lol. Told him not to sell or anything as its Unique. Lol.
---
I'd be happy to! 
---
PSN is KoingWolf if you want to add me whenever. 
---
HAHAHA they are annoying. 
---
Makes sense! You deserve a lot more recognition so good job! 
---
I too was laughing, it was a funny moment especially since I never see it before. 
---
I‚Äôd love a buff. I have a Quad single-action, and I love the reactions I get from people when I reload it, I just wish it was a more viable option.
---
Bulk items and sell them. Ceramic, glass, steel and wood are basically everywhere all the time, so keep 5 of each and sell the rest. Also never store and always sell non preserved foods. Food is everywhere anyway, there's no no real need to store more than a days worth of food and water.
---
Thank you for all the feedback. Sounds like this is just going to be an issue for a while, but at least I've got a couple avenues to pursue. 
---

They should add in a new quest line with dual wield for single handed weapons and for shields

Since the brewing update, I go through 50 boiled waters about every 2 hours. Sitting in a stream and collecting dirty water is getting old as fuck.

5 caps
---
No offence taken. That makes sense actually.
---
I would really like being able to have a few preset builds. So I have several slots, and can switch between builds/loadouts with 1 button press, rather than manually changing all the cards. So resource/crafting/battle build preset with the cards I want in each specific load out. üòä

Don‚Äôt forget darts
---
They could make the smog like the fog I. The Sierra Madre casino dlc in new vegas
---
I feel your pain man, I wish you luck! 
---
i can play the banjo!
---
That would be nice. I always forget to switch perk back and forth.
---
Yeah, gave up on it for tonight. It was ridiculous. 
---
I'll keep checking, can't hurt. Thanks man
---
You'll find that, for better or worse. many people don't want to work or think as part of their entertainment experience.  They prefer stories to be handed to them. And they are so used to games that provide that sort of handholding that they just rush through the game, expecting the game to force cutscenes on them when they're supposed to pay attention. 
---
And then they complain that the Fallout 76 storyline is empty, because from their perspective, it was.
---
what Bethesda have said is for at least the first 2 dlc batches nothing off the main map will be released, the 3rd one and beond is anyone guess
---
I doubt they will. Bethesda only nerfs the things that help the player.
---
Also vault 76 is always a free fast travel point, and only ten caps away from flatwoods for trading. Try and center your camp between traders, but I always build on hilltops or water so that your camp is as safe as possible. With the water purifier plans you can probably make at least 10 purified waters in a day, so you will always have free health waiting for you at home.
---
This would be so nice honestly. 
---
I wish they had Rose as the DJ.  There is already a channel where she talks about chems and how badass raiders are, I don't understand why they didn't combine them.

I‚Äôve been habitually picking up pre-war money because you could get 10 caps for it in fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas, but this has resulted in me getting over 100 pounds of raw cloth. Maybe this idea will help with that.
---
Depends on your playstyle. If you're out to complete the story or only interested in questlines. Then you  could easily go weeks without interacting with anyone. If however you do public events then by there nature they bring people together. After finishing the game you can  spend your time in public events or becoming an urban legend for the newbies, '...and then out of nowhere, this guy jumps of the cliff, into the middle of the mutants. There's a crackle of lightning, and then he just pulls out a knife and stabs all of them. All you heard was them to laughing on their mic, going 'Stabby,stabby,stabby morherfuckers!' Then he drops a paper bag on the ground with 40 stimpacks in it'
---
Is this the same guy who beat Jevil first try ON STREAM?
---
It's not on nukacrypt so it's not solved yet
---
Put the half wall on the top instead of the bottom and the fireplace inside
---
I think whoever wrote these stories did a great job qithout 
---
OMG. Too complicated, but I know some people love to do that technical stuff. Nice job figuring it out.
---
bloodied and furious both cap at +100% damage, bloodied is just 5% extra damage for every 5% health lost, and furious adds 15% damage every shot (unless it changed from fallout 4, but that's how it appears to work.) 25% faster fire rate is really just 25% extra dps, but might not work that way if you have a small magazine and have to reload a lot (not a problem with gatling plasma), however you will use more ammo. 10% damage is just 10% more damage. Anti-armor and instigating are worth mentioning, but anti-armor doesn't outshine furious or bloodied even when they're only half active (i could explain this, but i used a damage formula that is wayy too much hassle to actually do again lol).  Instigating is great for high damage weapons and sneak attacks, but only in those situations, and dont do anything in pvp because nobody is ever at full health (realistically).
---
Platform?
---
I saw insult bot for the first time today, but sadly he died in the war between us and the queen üòÇüòÇ
---
He didnt do much when I interacted with him because he was targeting another player but just seeing a random level 50 protectron named Insult Bot walking towards the fissure was funny 
---
Maybe the robot didn't think you deserved insults then
---
And the bot should be invincible. For 1 minute lol
---
PC
---
Yes, through daily challenge rewards.
---
I wear both, you can have both of those with the Eye of Ra and the eye of Ra is visible while wearing the Garb of Mysteries, it would be nice to have other stuff to go in that slot with normal armor or costumes.
---
create floors to make a second layer, and put the half wall on the floor, then add slanted roofs above that and slanted walls under that. 
---
I Can confirm this location. i found it there just now. 
---
hahaha. I have actually spent time at the speak easy in just my underwear. No one noticed. I was disappoint.
---
From what I‚Äôve read the Grafton dam never got its valves opened so the water from Grafton steel and I assume sewage just backed up and finally popped flooding the area. But I‚Äôll have to digs around there again. 
---
Not a one.  What are you playing on?
---
Lmao! Sometimes I‚Äôm there on the stage just chillin‚Äô doing the ‚Äúair guitar‚Äù pose and people always just pass by me. Did get a couple good scares out of it though lol
---
There's the brick set, which requires concrete to build, but it looks nothing like the concrete kit from Wasteland workshop. 
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken Grafton Steel was polluting the air or something. More info on the Ms.Nanny ‚ÄúKidnapping‚Äù mission. But I could be mistaken 
---
Some companies have a hard time getting gambling and simulated gambling to pass the game rating board. 
---
PC. I havent had this issue before.
---
You mean the reload bug?  Gatling Plasma has it as well.  "Surely" it's just a simple case of using the wrong variable name in some code somewhere.  Should be an easy fix.  But chances are they'll fix it in a patch and afterwards the gun will break whenever you reload it, or become single-shot only, or the quick weapon switch will never remember it, or.. or... maybe we're better off with the bug we know :/
---
Theoretically using a test server, an hour at most.  
---
Most of the issues with '76 can be replicated in FO4, and then fixed by reverse engineering the situation.  
---
In this case there are some new flags, and some not yet decoded level gating, so we can theorize by comparing the pre-patch to post patch and identifying what changes and then work backwards to fix it 
---
Bloodied just gives the most benifit for running with low health. 
---
Why not use vanguard instead?
---
&gt;Apparently TSE has been nerf‚Äôd but is it still the best?
---
lol its not hte best its trash. high fire rate weapons with explosive or multishot weapons like shotguns or harpon guns . tse are shit
---
Hmm. Well, I dont mind waiting. I just think that would solve most of the complaints, wishes, desires ,and deals with various gods, financial institutions, and the universe in general. 
---
You better have fox jerky or you aren't a real convenience store! I wish I could upvote this twice for the Clerks reference. 
---
Perk loadouts or allowing the camp itself to equip perk cards. That way, some of those camp specific perks can be used frequently.
---
I‚Äôve got a quad flechette harpoon, it‚Äôs a fun shotgun. I haven‚Äôt played around with the broadsider, I forgot about the multi shot canister, that actually makes it kind of interesting. Too bad the ammo is so damn heavy!
---
I haven‚Äôt had any drop besides the initiate and my buddy has gotten all the way up to paladin since they put the plans in
---
Wow, I've been to that guy's house in the pic! I bought something off him one time.
---
Ive mentioned its legitimate. But i dont have to like it lol. And u admitted its cheap.  I know its there and wont stop me from playing but the heart of it is. Its taken these cheap tactics off the adventure server and that i do like.  Means i can choose if i want to subject myself to the possible mysery of this or not.  
---
I'm more talking about how he managed to get a wall in between the full length of two other walls. Effectively halfing the available area.. if you get what I mean.
---
So from from to back - he put a wall in between 50% of them. Making an H shape.
---
Holy, I've wanted someone to make a colony/town for a long time but I think this is the first time I've seen one look good!
---
That‚Äôs incredible. Very well done. 
---
They should include more weather overall. Where are our seasons?
---
What do u play on
---
If you have a few I‚Äôm definitely a taker, never been able to get one to spawn from day one beta. Game tag RoaringAnemone6.

So now you need to be a VATS Crit build? RIP once again to Heavy PA users.

The amount of times that has kept me
---
Alive is TOO MUCH
---
I was booted just after I launched my first ever nuke. It was awesome. 
---
The ultimate insult, not even worth his time to insult.
---
They hotfixed spawn camping in Survival too. Means you can run away for a bit, instead of getting killed before you even load in. 
---
It didn't really help. For me, nights look like a cloudy day, at least for most of the map. I wish that dark nights was a menu option, and will hope for a mod.
---
I'm on PC as well, I didn't play for terribly long (yet), but a few hours over a half-dozen servers.  I didn't have as much as a hiccough.
---
Nobody ever really bothers any more, but you could check your network between your location and the servers (not sure where to look for them though) to see if there's network issues somewhere between you and the game.
---
things that will never happen

These puckers sold me a dart board and no darts. Get you chit together bethesda!!ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  ü§£üòÇüòÇ
---
I read somewhere that Furious isn‚Äôt as strong as Fo4 and it Caps somewhere between 30-50% but who knows lol
---
I just read the nerf patch notes for two shot and explosive (what I should have done in the first place) and they add +25% damage each. I kind of want to move away from explosive so I don‚Äôt accidentally kill myself from another person walking in front of me or any other similar situation. Buuuut I might have to deal with it and adjust my play style. As far as two shot, think I‚Äôll drop it and gab bloodied (probably fits me best because I mainly roll with a bloodied unarmed build)
---
that is THE hunting lodge
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I remember telling people who thought "no human npcs = no story" that some of my favorite quests in previous fallout games had no human interaction at all, and they refused to believe me. Even when i gave examples. Even so, the environmental storytelling is one of the best parts of modern fallout games imo. You dont need a quest marker or actual dialogue to tell a story.
---
To explain a game mechanic.
---
Legos that hate you 
---
I think a lot of these animals need to be a little more common first and foremost.  Rabbits, squirrels, and chickens are pretty uncommon.  There are certain spawn points where a variety of generally non-hostile creatures can spawn, and it's mostly radstags, but rarely, you'll get fireflies, and frogs, and whatever else.
---
There should be probably be more defined spawns for them so we can always find them.  As far as I know, one of the guaranteed spawns for frogs is the pool by the golf club at Whitepspring, I always see a few of those things, but I don't think I've ever seen them guaranteed elsewhere. 
---
Fallout 3 got panned for a lot of environmental storytelling and hidden mechanics. I'm not surprised it's happening again
---
You spelled caps wrong 
---
Well at it's core, Fallout 76 is still a single player game with other people running around. They still can't make up their mind about stash and base limits. 
---
The servers are not persistent, you can't build a base to share with your other toons. Let alone, other people. If the servers were persistent I feel this would be a good idea. Games like Conan Exiles requires you to feed your thralls and log into the game every so many days or your stuff goes away. They have open world persistent building. So its a needed feature. These are things that would need to be addressed before maintenance fees. Which your suggestion falls into. 
---
A possible solution is to add instance housing like ESO. Which could help solve the shared player housing issue, without affecting the current base CAMP system. The instance housing could be purchased or require some sort of maintenance for players to hold onto it. Your idea would fit well here. Forcing players to band together to maintain a "SAFE PLACE." The owner could then assign who has access to it. Making it effectively a guild house.
---
Just trying to give some constructive feedback.
---
I just picked up this quest and its still having issues.
---
Not that I'm aware. Seen this plenty, fought 3 Queens in about 20 minutes one night and it was awesome.
---
Funny enough, I was planning on offering that...
---
If i understand correctly, walls actually also snap to roofs and the sides of other walls, so if you were to temporarily create a wall sort of half and half with another wall, then place a roof, you would be able to place the wall (or half wall) where you wanted by snapping it to the roof instead of the ground. It's really finicky, I recommend just playing around with that information until you figure it out.
---
Hey the guy's been drunk his whole life, against his will. Let him have as many birthdays as he wants.
---
I might be able to try and build it for you later on

I dont believe this chart is accurate
---
Signing on right now, completely forgot. HeadlessRiver61
---
You have to place the Gate first, then the other parts. It's a bit silly but that's how it works at the moment.
---
Very rarely. I pretty much have to seek them out. 
---
Every legit CS has a jerky selection. Is fox the only one?
---
I mean so you think having the ability to lockpicking, hacking, crafting, ECT should lock you out of dealing damage then? since you can either go with the damage perks or the crafting perks in your idea
---
How many have you done? It took e an average of about 25 to get one new paint I'd say
---
Yeah im assuming most likely they were just tired of nuking the same old places. Gets old constantly nuking whitesprings
---
Yep. Same here. Noticed it after the last major update. 
---
How do you know it's the same silo? You can have 3 active nukes at anytime. Heck you can really ramp stuff up by dropping all 3 on the same spot within seconds of each other. 3 scorch beast queens anyone?
---
each nuke silo has it's own count down timer
---
No Preston !!! Don‚Äôt like him one bit ü§¨
---
It is empty, but that's by design. To quote todd howard at the E3 reveal, each server has "...dozens of players, not hundreds and not thousands. It's a wasteland, not an amusement park."
---
I don't see players often, and when i do 60% of the time it's cuz i seek them out for whatever reason.
---
3-4 plans a day for the last two weeks
---
6 months in and I still can't place down my CAMP, "needs support" and I am sick to death of having to remake it every, god, damn, time.
---
Four leaf clover is overrated for anyone who invests heavily in luck. Crit savy is all you need.
---
Virgin alert
---
I'm hoping prestige will allow for passive (non combat) perk slots to be unlocked.
---
If it's anything combat related I feel like that would make the current pvp gulf even worse, imagine having to go up against some with max combat perks for multiple weapons.
---
I need to show my allegiance with cultist items!
---
He is analyzing you and will insult you the next time you see him.
---
Pretty sure the Motherlode quest was about how the mining company was dumping all their chemical shit up there and trying to keep the press away from it.
---
i finally managed to get on. it was super weird though
---
Or I'd be willing to buy one if anyone has an extra or one just laying around. 
---
Green Thumb imo.
---
As someone that makes their caps through farming and flower picking I can say Green Thumb is my favorite perk by far.
---
It ain't much but it's honest work.
---
Why Atoms, bruh? Why not caps?
---
Fantastic work  and a little jealous.  
---
Always loved that spot but never built there because I realized how popular it would be.
---
using a shotgun or tesla rifle perchance?
---
Thank you bathesda for loading them quickly again. Because my compound fortress was taking way to long
---
Is this also your gamertag?
---
I noticed after switching to a double barrel shotgun so yes
---
Comedy talent like that aint cheap!
---
Hahaha, yes!
---
Do explosive perks help with TSE guns? I didn‚Äôt think they did. 
---
I just got 28 dirty waters in like five seconds. This is AMAZING
---
They do
---
Agree, so so agree
---
i read on here that it did???
---
Explosive and the whichever weapon perk ie: rifleman, heavy etc and bloody mess are handy
---
yup, i run heavy, fireproof, white knight, explosives maxed.
---
nice doing business with you, looking forward to next time  SN: jimnvalerie
---
I know it was the same silo because I pulled up my map almost 20 times and there was only 2 people in the alpha silo every time I looked unless somehow there were other groups at different silos and they crouched the entire way through
---
Fighting 3 Queens at once sounds epic üî•üî•
---
Probably because they didn't know any better. I nuked  Dyer chemical for my first nuke launch because I didn't understand how nuke zones worked.  For some reason I had the idea that nuking the place would cause a chemical reaction or something and cause something cool to happen.  
---
And it was still pretty early in the game's release.  Like in late December I think. I had never seen the place nuked and was curious what might happened. It was a bit underwhelming, obviously but I couldn't have foreseen that with my limited knowledge at the time. 
---
Tagging this awesomeness for tomorrow night. 
---
That would be like the best player driven content ever. Plus it would mean there was an audience when the insult bot did his thing!
---
Demolition expert will help add to the damage of tse too as well
---
Alright, im pretty sure they knew some sort of glitch or something
---
Also did you get anything good out of those queens?
---
I have plenty of "click click next waypoint" friends and a few who read all the story items ...
---
I know but it seemed like this group bypassed it or something
---
id love to see some perk Utility slots. only can be used with any Utility card, no combat related perks can be added to it. say we get a max of 12 perk points we can use with utility cards
---
so say you pick your favorite utility cards and only swap those out as needed without having to unplug combat cards
---
Finally found the mod after running around the map a dozen times and hours of server hopping vendors
---
You‚Äôll have to come join me gt communistraptor at a fight arena right now

I've seen this posted a couple times but had never been able to replicated it for my bug roundup pages...

**Questions:**  
---
-Armor or Power Armor?  
---
-If armor Biocommesh?  
---
-Mutations? If so which.  
---
-Bloodied or non-Bloodied build?  If bloodied what are your stats sitting at?   
---
-Perks to effect Chems?  If so which?
---
Luck of the draw and lucky break at rank 1 have worked well so far. Helps save with repair costs 
---
You no what's funny as I cam across those a lot on ps4 though
---
A hardened reciever for Single Action Revolver!
---
The hit bug?
---
Thanks for the feed back everyone.
---
If a person is selling them that cheap, they were almost certainly duped. I don't think Signs and Letters plan drops in game. Not 100% sure, but if it does, it's super rare.
---
Damn that is quite unlucky 
---
Sorry, that‚Äôs my fault. I had chilli for lunch, you might want to give it 5 minutes.
---
Mhm I can‚Äôt even find a combat armor helmet the game hates me so much lol
---
Seems like the easiest thing to just be counted as a rifle. It shouldn‚Äôt be too hard or time consuming.
---
Skip demolition expert. Isn't worth the points to increase a 20% on the weapon by 60%. You're spending six perk points to increase your weapon by maybe 15 dmg.
---
I'll buy it
---
Two words. FAT MAN. Just kidding. I mean, you can destroy their C.A.M.P. at the risk of being wanted and retaliation. 
---
But aside from joking, because I don't have energy to waste in PVP in Adventure mode (yes, I'm looking at you jerks that purposely engage on taking over a workshop, not to take it over, but to kill someone.... quit being a pansy about not taking your lumps and go to survival mode). I totally get what you mean. It's one thing to deal with PVE and have that type of advantage, but just to be a dick for the sake of PVP..... That's why I stopped playing things like COD and Battlefield. I hate campers.
---
After spending my last 25 gears to finish building an awesome workshop.
---
Wait... BOS Initiate paint doesn't drop anymore?
---
This seems to have started around Patch 5, and it is outside of the accidental drop issue people have proposed, I've lost weapons right after fast traveling, pieces of power armor I was wearing after logging out, etc...  
---
Impossible to reproduce, I've tried, it's a weird one.
---
Ahh  I only have 1k
---
Demolitions Expert, Fireproof (so you do not kill yourself) and Grenadier 
---
Shame that the balls and rack weren't to scale. If I remember the rack only fit 10 or so balls instead of 15. 
---
ok..got it to work. I just logged to the menu screen and popped on another server/realm.   Ran back..and the holo tap was now sitting next to the note. I played it immediately and it satisfied the quest.
---
Also a fanning perk card for revolvers!
---
I think this is something they will improve progressively.
---
Or a nuclear bullseye. 
---
PSN andrewmosier
---
Yea I‚Äôm kind of wondering the same thing. Just started my second character and I‚Äôm wanting to get some low level goods!
---
To not be spawn killed by people exploiting invisibility glitch
---
Ill do 3c per screw, psn is Oakofoami if intrested.
---
Generally submitting as "Feedback" --&gt; "Gameplay" is the best, or the "Exploit" option if it's bad, all of those goes straight to the Devs.   
---
  
---
    
---
Having submitted hundreds of reports and having some back and Forth with Bethesda due to said reports id suggest making sure you include every little detail you can, including photos if you have them.
---
This exactly my question, if i bring a brand new char to survival and complete the weekly challenge, do i earn a max lv weapon or scaled to my currently low lv char?
---
Yeah thatd be great for my situation as well, either way. 
---
Same.  I tried playing with them a few times, and it was constantly run to the next click, then run off again.  They didn't read anything or look around, then quit because "there's no story" plus the online hate.
---
don't remember. They killed her pretty fast also. One was under 2 minutes, another she flew around about 6 then died within a minute of landing and the other was about 10 minutes but she landed once for a few seconds and again and never left the ground again. Was me and a buddy with a crew of like 6-7 people that kept spawning her. Was hoping they would do more. 
---
What about Flux?
---
If I felt bothered to make a video, it really isn't that complicated when looking at it. Just takes time.
---
ha NOPE 
---
Well, of course! That's why we love all Bethesda games, isn't it?
---
got them at watoga at level 30
---
I really like the idea of having 2 decks, and rewards/challenges that allow up to 4. Fits the narrative of cards. Spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs.
---
But for extra flavor can make them Fallout specific. Mushroom Cloud, Maybe actual severed hearts, a wood club with nails. Not sure what diamonds would fit. 
---
I think BSG knows that the perk system mechanics needs some work as this is a common complaint.  It would be nice to know if they are working on it or not. I also ask that cards be able to be locked. For instance, starched genes  will NEVER be taken out of my  active perk cards. Locking it down assures that I'll never have to worry about accidentally removing the card and losing my mutations.
---
Nevermind

150 VATS Criticals. Use a shotgun (double barrel if you've got it) to maximize the criticals per shot.
---
yes to perk loadouts!!!!!
---
You can get 3 legendaries doing the leader of the pack event but I think they are only level 10 
---
I'm not sure, but I think only certain animals are able tk be tamed. I remember reading about this on another post and recall somebody saying rhat tameable animals only spawn in certain places per server. Only thing I remember is that I believe there's a tameable cat somewhere south of Abbie's bunker? I'm not 100% sure about this. The post was made some time ago, and I'm old, so don't remeber exactly what the entire post said, LoL. Maybe do a search for it, I dunno. I'm new to Reddit, so not sure how searching on here works yet. I've only been on here for about a week, if that'll help give your search a timeline to go by. Good luck ‚ò∫
---
Explosive in my opinion is overrated. It's a 20% damage boost that is not fully active in pvp and what ever it dies add can be completely negated by fireproof and dense. Much prefer 25% fire rate. 
---
I thought they'd keep the trading cow between camps in FO4..
---
I used to follow them sometimes.. and find some hidden surprises along the way..
---
Damn that‚Äôs a lot. Probably not going to have time to get that done. Thanks for the info tho
---
It's worth it for the effect on grenades. Survival a single mirv grenade is a room clearing force. 
---
build a scarecrow...
---
It‚Äôs not bad per say, it just allows the player to circumvent the quest and complete it without doing what is asked in the quest. 
---
I did it by accident and again just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt assuming anything and sure enough it worked.
---
Low level legendaries? Best area? Heck, that's easy, wherever the heck I am. So, golf course, Blackwater mine, 99% of the public events. But seriously, those spots as long as there aren't any high level players.
---
How about a Round of Caravan?
---
How about making lockpick and hacking a skill? Instead of perks the more you lockpick the better you get at it.
---
I've assumed, without evidence, that optionals give more xp, caps, goodies or plans
---
I'd like to see a more mixed variety of higher level enemies....constantly seeing level 62 Charred ferals and 42 gangrenous gets old...(Also why do they all run like Usain Bolt? They're all rotting and irradiated corpses...)
---
Sometimes Optional portions of quests are shortcuts bypassing possibly tedious steps.
---
Sometimes they provide small boosts to rewards.
---
It depends on the mission or quest.
---
Got wiped huh?

Passives would be nice like lock pick or terminal hacking. Though the current system requires you to have 3 in PER to lockpick level 3 locks, which is the caveat of the whole system. If you don't allocate the special points there, then you can't use those abilities. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Also it would be fantastic if the 1x2 staircases would just stack naturally. 
---
Huh? It does 
---
It could be performance limitation on the amount of unique objects you can have on screen. Considering that the game already runs like trash compared to Fallout 4 and ability to build anywhere, this might be a big issue.
---
No I mean it shouldn‚Äôt in adventure
---
Then I'd use the "Feedback" --&gt; "Quest" and make you mark it as an exploit at the bottom
---
Got there. Seen them. Thanks everyone..
---
Don't feel bad I finally got an explosive gun from a drop close to 500 hours playing time
---
to be able to switch preset builds that you create your.self.  So you don‚Äôt have to move one card at a time. you just move a bunch of cards At once (crafting). Then to switch back to the ones you was using (combat)

A highlight from tonight

Fallout 4 don't have that problem‚Ä¶ why should 76?
---
Butnotashardasawifflebatanium
---
Don't bother. If you want to get to the finish quickly then jump ahead. Some folks aren't into taking time in games these days. Do whatever makes you happy.
---
I don‚Äôt know if the game can stay stable while playing with a a Gatling Plasma that has even more fire rate lol
---
wow way to use your privilege to attack me from a position of power.   Racist
---
Wow so privileged 
---
I actually enjoy the lore of this game so I been doing the optionals in case there‚Äôs a bit of knowledge - even if it‚Äôs just how someone died.
---
Absolutely. If you use grenades demolition expert is very useful
---
Because they are different games. Fallout 4 runs with 90 FPS for me while 76 at 50-60. Start adding more stuff and it will be even worse. In F4 locations that allow build can be optimized by developers when in 76 several people can build close by in the most performance heavy location in the world.
---
I was just about to complete the ecological balance quest after trying three times.
---
I have had up to four or five thousand atoms a couple of times. I've spent it and earn almost all of the free atoms  every day except for the ridiculous stuff for leveling up three times in one day. At level 182 that's not happening anymore.
---
I can't agree more that we need Enclave X-01 paint so that one may properly display their faction allegiance!
---
Though personally I'd prefer [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/240) gentleman's interpretation of X-01. While not complete matte black Enclave color, I feel it more effectively differentiates the Appalachian Enclave from the rest of the Enclave.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad. I went 7-9 runs with her not dropping anything what so ever. Despite being involved from start to finish. 
---
It's an automated program that no one shut off. 
---
Thank you so much

You click the button and things just die.
---
I didn't know that.
---
My ideal pvp heavy weapon is a furious fire rate lmg.
---
Kill the card system entirely. It's annoying and brings no practical benefit. They imagined it as a 'you have to be careful about how you set up your build, but we didn't want to completely gimp people or make them make a dozen characters.' So they made it that any character can have anything, but only so much at once.
---
The trouble is, and I can't believe this wasn't picked up on during their admittedly laughably short testing, this isn't fun or engaging. It's simply tedious as you slowly build up the cards you want then constantly swap things out for the best use of each situation. It doesn't make people choose their builds carefully, it just makes people have to spend long time staring at the terribly designed perk screen swapping around cards instead of you know... playing the game and having fun.
---
Yep
---
If anything I would think it‚Äôs luck..
---
I think making fast travel use caps was one of the better decisions in the game. Having fast travel for free means there is never a situation when you wouldn't want to fast travel, and makes completing quests a boring game of teleporting around. With the cap cost, you now have to consider whether the time saved is worth the caps spent, and encourages people to actually walk through the open world bethesda so lovingly crafted. The downside is that if you're smart with camp placement, travel agent, and spending your money you never have to worry about fast travel being too expensive, and even if you have to walk instead of fast travel, it's tedious with how massive the map is and how spread out all the locations are. Overall I'd rather have it than not since it promotes figuring out ways to game the system into letting you move fast for little caps but I can see how it can be tedious and annoying for players that have made some bad decisions with their caps.
---
I know.
---
Nothing really effects what the RNG gives you, it's just RNG. Luck will effect the condition of items you get though.
---
Oh ok I'm just starting a new toon and I'm trying not to have my points spread to the wind like my other char. Since I didnt know what I was doing I really fucked my build up
---
If they do this, then those with bounties, or people who are currently PvPing, seeking revenge, or players who are playing Hunter/Hunted should have to use caps to fast travel.
---
Otherwise you'd just get that one person who will do nothing but fast travel to avoid PvP.
---
lvl 30? hmmm whats the other legendary effects?
---
just guessing id say this is worth 2k maybe 3k as its only lvl30
---
üëâüëåüò∞üòÇüòÇ

There was a small amount of sarcasm in my reply. Just an old timer yelling at  the kids. But yeah, some people just seem unhappy at having to actually have to do missions or discover sections slowly, rather than enjoy the ride. I want all the endgame stuff now! I'm level 25 and done it all!
---
If you're on PS4 I've got a good level 20 chameleon piece for you.
---
you deserve way more up votes
---
No, this challenge is stupidly easy. My buddy and I both did it in a half hour.
---
Craft a lvl 1 pistol (pistols use the least amounts of AP in VATs.) Use the pistol to fill your crit meter. Switch to a shotgun, and fire your critical shot. Shotgun crits gives 8 pellets 100% chance to hit, and each pellet counts as toward the 150. 
---
So every shotgun crit gives you +8 toward the challenge.
---
Could very well be. At least the answer to the question of why nobody nuked Garrahan was an obvious one - there was nothing there worth nuking.
---
This sub is damn near the life of this game
---
Yeah, everything was instant this morning. If they could only keep it that way...  Seems like things take a day to settle down after a patch - I'm sure the laggy performance will return.
---
I like the sound of that, theres no Jet in the game anyways, incluiding plans for pre war items like the tables etc, sounds fun
---
hey im up for a bloodied meat hook how much?
---
I detect some sarcasm here... But regardless don't underestimate the pipe rifle. My Bloodied one kills Scorched Beasts in a single clip.
---
Maybe a glitch, but I'm on a new server and I can see the tag of the guy who saved me: AngelLopez214. 
---
FO4 was known to require players to restart the game occasionally as the game bogged down over time. Could be the bug carried over?
---
I‚Äôve gotten it a few times. I notice the music stops too so I think it‚Äôs just an audio bug. 
---
I tend to go to the workshop steel heart is in, and server hop.  There's a fair amount of boxes of loose screws unless someone else has grabbed them.
---
Pvp is really silly in this game and honestly a scam. Shouldnt even  lose caps let alone double.
---
Acid. You can get a ton of steel from running westek and scrapping everything (as well as gunpowder). Lead ore from lucky hole mine (about 1.2k lead after broken down with acid). Acid can also be used to make gunpowder if you are short and don't want to hunt super mutants. 
---
(buying it from another player will be cheaper)
---
I think you could reach 30% reduction (max) with HB3 &amp; 15CHA..
---
I carry a pretty extensive wardrobe and get minor LOL‚Äôs from replicating someone else‚Äôs outfit then popping out of chameleon/stealth just in front of them.
---
Let‚Äôs just say reactions vary widely...
---
I think its 30% off with hard bargain 3 but I'm not sure about 15 charisma, I have 3 charisma and some PA plans cost 7200 without hard bargain, maybe u can do the math
---
Right, survival being low cost and all
---
I gotta say that's a pretty cool use of the stone logo
---
I moved all my caps its just annoying that I keep getting spawn killed
---
Every time I get the Insult Bot it will just stand there. I wish it'd insult me.
---
Oh shit! I didn‚Äôt know that each shotgun pellet would count. That does make it easier. Where were you guys for all the enemies 
---
The one today, or last week? Haven't noticed anything different in my gaming. Which must mean I either haven't been playing well or there might be issues your side. 
---
no glitch that im aware of. Unless you watched the missile fly out of the silo you dont know that it came from the same one. im pretty sure ive seen quite a few people put thier bases near alpha so might think someone is running it when they arent. 
---
Chill they're cosmetic items, not everyone is going to have them all. The idea is the atom store funds future updates. It doesn't work if people can earn atoms to buy everything. Plus your last idea is basically p2w. 
---
My username is not enough of a clue? Well, it contain a spelling error that i'm pretty ashamed of, but english speaking people never notice.

There's also unmarked quest. The factory was smelting radioactive wastes. Dead manager on top of the furnance. 
---
I‚Äôve made at least seven bases, crafting tables and all, just to have to move my CAMP and lose it all. The least they could do is make it so you can un-assemble already assembled buildings. 
---
Oh, sorry, yes uranium.
---
I know but sustained fire with the gun creates a bit of lag and I‚Äôm thinking with even more fire rate during a scorch beast queen fight would crash my game
---
&gt; I started farming with other people.
---
That's what I always  do. Between me and my buddy, we got about nine high radiation fluids out of what felt like close to 100 ghouls.  They mostly dropped glowing and hardened mass. 
---
This seems like kind of a pattern.  Another zone I might find  loads of high rad fluid dropping and almost no glowing mass. 
---
Feels like each nuke zone has its own RNG for flux materials for that particular session.   I understand and am tolerant of RNG for certain items.  This just feels really over the line to me though. 
---
Last weeks patch has really nerfed me
---
Yeah, I know why the atom store exists. I specifically mentioned funding the game in my comment. And an xp boost, cosmetic skins, and a vendor cap increase aren‚Äôt pay to win at all. Pay to win would be getting something like an exclusive set of armor that‚Äôs better than in game options. The suggestions I made are a slight convenience boost, nothing more. 
---
Probably spamming stims or foid/drink.

---
I blame the tricentenials, those lazy kids! Oh I hate the 2700's. Save the Earth's 15th Ozone layer
---
I have had scorchbeasts attack me before so that is a likely scenario.
---
Is someone going to die if you don‚Äôt get the screws?  I can give you some if you need them that bad.
---
They may have been using vampiric weapons which gives health every time they land a hit mix that with adrenal reaction and healing factor and you have a very hard person to kill
---
Stimpack spamming, you have to out dps the heal rate.
---
Hah! He lost 20 minutes of nuke farming. Get some CBD or something. 
---
Or I meant to say possible because it to me it sounds different to a scorchbeast
---
I don't about bugs. All i know that i see a sort of notification icon beside names of players sending invites. And when i "click" their name (on xbox) it give severals option like to see profile but also to accept team invites.
---
Sorry you have problem with that function. Even though maybe others people have open a support ticket it, you should create a new one. Might speed up things a little.
---
Can't upvote this shit hard enough, blueprints for the most part worked great at the start and it was a part of the game I was very impressed with.
---
Now we have a blueprint budget for ants
---
Resurrecting this thread if I can, I have logged in and out multiple times for this, and cannot get the ID card. It will not spawn. I can get through the first door with a friend's help, but that doesn't matter with the laser grid. No card, No Passage.
---
Using a shotgun gets you 8 criticals. It'll take you 30 minutes. Maybe an hour.
---
I‚Äôm working towards the excavator armor. It‚Äôs not really as urgent as I made it sound, I‚Äôd just rather get the suit together so I can progress in the story. 
---
I would say that he already visit me enough, thanks.
---
But it's nice idea anyway.
---
I'm under the impression they do but it's only an increase on the actual explosive damage caused by the weapon rather than an increase on the weapons overall damage - so it's less of a boost than you'd expect. 
---
How many screws you need?
---
It increases the effective max range before damage starts being reduced by distance. Doesn't matter if you're scoped or sighted.
---
picture isn't working for me it seems.  Just an Imgur 404 page.
---
What do you mean your change is not simplyfor lore reasons? The lore canon is that the dispensers were changed to accept caps instead of cash as a promotion created by Nuka Cola just before the bombs fells and thus were never reverted.

---
If I had my way with it you still couldn't have more passive slots than special, but they would be separate. So if you had 2 perception you could have two combat related perks and up to two passive slots as well. Something like an exchange rate of 10 levels per passive slot would seem to be a fair trade off.
---
Well shit if you were on PS4 I‚Äôd give me to you.

I have read that you need to do the repair to get the Legendary "Perfect Storm" 10mm SMG. Otherwise you just get a normal version. I don't know for sure though, and don't want to complete it and miss out on getting it.
---
Try running sugar grove and the Charleston herald
---
well there is big portions of the map with big potential so Im good with them using what we have before talking about other places.
---
This has gotten me to thinking the customers should band together to create a ToS of their own. Rule number one: If your game is a broken ass mess or using a game engine that is over a  decade old the game company will be banned from working on new titles and will lose access to all the games they have made previously. 
---
I think that sounds pretty damn fair to me.
---
Heads up, I just completed it and I still got it. So maybe that‚Äôs what they patched. Maybe they just made it so it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you fix it or not. Idk, but I got it still. 
---
Scarecrows are purely cosmetic lol

Cant find ur gt

They said they was gonna nerf you. Just you tho. üòÇ

Pretty sure that was only at the Whitesprings resort.
---
Yes most of the items on the Atom store are overpriced but they have to be that way for the game to be a viable product for Bethesda.  Fallout 76 has a one time price tag and after that you don't have to pay.  It has to use the micro-transaction model to maintain this type of format.  If the atom store would be removed; Bethesda would likely need to charge a monthly fee to play.
---
Most MMO's (and many other types of  free to play games) have adopted this type of system.

What I'm getting here misplaced whining/argument from people who've exploited relentlessy and/or are deep in the FO76 black market.
---
 You lose sight of the fact that the majority of players have one or two characters with a couple thousand caps at most. Takes a lot of balls and / or ignorance to highlight 25k as a priority problem with the game. 
---
Duper's fucked the economy indefinitely and probably shortened the lifespan of a game I paid money for. Everyone even seems to give a pass because they like their two-shot Sentinel gear.

I want those mounts...

I would like to see them put the ranger outfit from New Vegas in the atom shop. 
---
Also if they are looking for feed back; on the adventure mode I would like to see focus on the trinity and more (harder) dungeons with puzzles and big boss at the end. I think running a tank or med build would be fantastic in 76. They could even add special "dungeon" cards for team play. Only usable in a group and shareable. Medic cards heal team, tank cards draw fire and boost defense and dps cards up damage. Lock them to one set per character. He'll make em tradeable between players and people could spend hours building the perfect sets for each class.
---
Jmho
---
Pretty sure it increases VATS range too. Might be good to swap in for a sniper duel. 3*'s, you'd have 30% longer range than any other VATS sniper shmoe.
---
Did you drop them or did you place them? If you just drop them anyone can take them and you‚Äôd have to join the same world to get them back if they are just sitting there. 
---
For me the problem OP is talking about is often caused by thoses stairs.
---
Pretty sure White Springs is the best for that.
---
That's not what I'm discussing here, but also I don't see how you're getting Atoms from events. I'm not talking about getting Atoms from the game, I'm talking about artificial scarcity. I mean, look, even if I could get 1.5k in two days from farming events (most I've gotten is 500 in one week from no-lifing the Faschnaut event. I did get like 100 of those worthless masks, though), I still would feel no incentive to buy these items that are too expensive, and that are soon to be removed.
---
All the price and scarcity does is make me want to save up for something that I truly need, instead of spending it on just about anything that I vaguely want.
---
you don‚Äôt get violet from white springs tho :( 
---
Where ya dropping it?
---
Probably had people in multiple silos, and son one of the group members launch, they all went to sbq, then one traveled back to one of the other silos to launch another one. The group I roll with sometimes does this all the time. And she's usually dead in 3 minutes or so

The environmental story telling in this game is top notch.  When I see complaints about the game‚Äôs story, it baffles me as it seems that most criticisms come from people who never gave the game a chance.
---
A lot of the holotapes have stories that show the desperation of people who knew they were going to die, and the message is repeated in countless areas to give you a sense of impending dread that faced the Appalachia wasteland before the vault ever opened.  
---
I honestly think that if the responders storyline was as strong as the other areas, that it would‚Äôve been better received on first glance (since most opinions were created from the first few forest areas).
---
To really understand Morgantown airport and what happened there, you need to find out what the Brotherhood of Steel were doing.  Then it puts a bow on why everyone in the first area is seemingly dead.
---
Beautiful.

On October maybe, in the ini files.

Awesome news, thanks for the update and taking the plunge!

Up vote, one of my favorite things to do is go exploring to places that have nothing on the map.
---
I'm not talking about removing the Atom Store, it's just way too expensive and the idea of items being removed from it have the end result of me not spending any more money on the game. I also don't spend many of the Atoms earned, but rather will hold on to them for something I really need, instead of something that I just like.
---
Kill the prize bot.

I'd absolutely love some BoS decor for my camp, absolutely.

Still in the area near by at Pleasant Valley Cabin, when you use the main road on the right side you will see a small boat on a tow, inside there a Stealth Boy next to a dead raider.
---
Still at Pleasant Valley Cabin continue on the right to see the 3 Cabins/house with cooking stations in the middle, if you position yourself with 2 cabins on your left and the last one front of you then on the right side there a little metal shelf with a Stealth Boy.

Yeah true but New Vegas had Roulette, Blackjack and slots so hopefully that can happen again for a Fallout game even if it's just Blackjack

Does not increase overall range. Tested this with a friend (and isn't reflected in pip-boy weapon stats either).

You‚Äôre welcome! You might want to wait a minute though, I am going to hop on and make sure I actually have it in my inventory. I don‚Äôt want to spread false info. All I saw was the pop up you get when you get a legendary item, but with all the bugs and stuff, I want to actually make sure I have it.

I‚Äôm with you on the whole ‚Äúenjoy the ride‚Äù. I grew up with metal gear solid and final fantasy and the stories were great, they had plot twists, a main antagonist, and beating those games felt rewarding.

I‚Äôm gonna get every dollars worth from this game before I move on to red dead redemption 2 - I‚Äôll keep coming back to this game during content releases or if I‚Äôve 100% the future games I want (just need to beat red dead redemption 2  fo4 and far cry 5) so I got tons of time killing and enjoyable content to explore lol.

I'd settle for that; at least it's got the Enclave emblem on it.

I need a BoS flag pole and wall mounted flag, some posters would be great too....

They must have nerfed the spawn rates cause I'm guessing someone complained about having too many enemies.

Sometimes i feel as though Bethesda is nerfing it to death...
---
You're probably not going to get a response but that's 100% right.Dude was the drop option instead of placing them and had to relog. 
---
It encourages diversifying your builds by giving you a way to swap between them quickly
---
What kind of bloodied stuff do you have?
---
Your well thought out constructive feedback is appreciated.
---
The only catch to instance housing is, for good or bad, you miss out on the random encounters at peoples homes. For me this has been mostly positive in F76

I wish the silos were full of scorched. The robots get so tedious after your 30th launch

Toxic Valley, but you should have no problem completing this where ever you want to.

Just take of the perk Dodgy if you have it. You don‚Äôt want all your APs to be wasted dodging damage when you need them for VATs.

Awesome
---
What are the explosive perks under
---
Sure.  But a LONG time in the future.  There's too much stuff to fix and improve before fishing is added.
---
Only option at this point.
---
Charisma matters.
---
Same. The storytelling for this game received a lot or backlash but I seriously believe that it's mostly unwarranted since I've found the environmental storytelling really well made and laid out for you to find.
---
Was always fun in previous games to find out a random holotape about old history a d trying to track it down to see how it all ends. And in this game I find it no less fun to do so.
---
I agree, it's one of my favorite locations with the Silent Hill vibe- oppressive fog in certain areas (maybe could roll into other places like a storm too) would be good.
---
I will probably buy atoms at some point, if only to support future content. I don't see a reason to spend  cash on cosmetic items, but there is a significant reason why companies use MTA's in games. There are a lot of people willing to spend money for Atom shop items, it doesn't hurt the rest of us, and it helps keep this game going. I won't begrudge them that.
---
I feel like these guys who are farming the area for hours straight are killing it.
---
It's absurd when I log on and pay 30 caps to travel to the Whitespring and nothing spawns. I pay to travel to Watoga and all of the bots die as soon as they spawn. I go into the Civic center and it's empty.
---
You can get charisma so high with unyielding that hard bargain offers no addition discount.
---
Oh my god. If I would've just placed them they would've came back. I feel like an idiot.
---
I saw one tonight near the satellite array! Only a level 19.
---
Sounds like your internet connection isn't too great.  Don't have anything like this sort of prob on PS4.
---
They obviously did something.
---
I hope this wasn't their idea to stop XP farming. They are ruining the game for the rest of us.

I mean, you can craft throwing knives.

Welcome to Bethesda.
---
This. The damage and defensive/offensive perks are part of the build. Having weight-reduction, crafting, and lock-picking/hacking perks reduce the options available for your build makes the game less fun.
---
Yeah I assumed you'd say that, it's more about whether you are getting packet loss / lag specifically to the amazon servers that FO76 is hosted on.  Just saying, it's not the same for everyone, so it's something specific to you, and your rig sounds like it's up to the task; unusual net connectivity would be my guess.  Oh.  If you're using wifi, try running a cable just to see if you're getting bottlenecked there. 
---
Are they both one star?
---
I'm not grinding.
---
I travel around the map to a dozen places that are worth traveling to as a level 220 player with 650 hours. I deliberately wait until the level 50 players finish their 8 hour Watoga grind session before I travel there and nothing respawns.
---
I‚Äôd noticed this too, for the short time the game was playable this evening. I really hope they get on top of this soon because I absolutely loved this game. At the moment my faith in Bethesda has plummeted. 
---
I am also responsible for this for in the past I have left mountains of legendary weapons in the Ice Box.
---
I would love to be part of this, I can never find anyone to play with, my gt is Lupiir
---
They cap at like level 94 my dude. those ones are actually a bit scary
---
Resrouce Monitor shows no packet loss. I just checked (and still am) knowing that I forgot about Packet Loss. latency is only 30-40ms too
---
I am using wifi, but I have no access to a cable anywhere close to my rig. 
---
I hope everything is priced at 37 caps. Or 37 something else.
---
Yes they are. Fire axe is lvl 45, Tesla, 50.
---
Yea, it's basically a reroll on existing gear and I'm pretty sure it'll keep the star rating as well...so a 3\* crap roll can turn into a 3\* god roll. been holding on to a few legendaries for such thing.
---
I miss how they used to throw you around and stuff.
---
One of my favorite guns in FO4 was 10mm full auto explosive pistol.  Fire rate was like the MG42 and explosive rounds did enough damage.  Good holdout weapon for when your main gun ran out of bullets and you need breathing space to get away or finish off a battle.  I was going for a pistol build early on, but went heavy gunner/mele because that's the type of decent legendaries that dropped for me.  Never found a decent three star legendary pistol that could become my main weapon.  Until they buff up the hand cannons I won't waste any more perk cards on that weapon.
---
I can 2 shot those. One shot with melee
---
hahaha..... i've bought 5 mutations from the bunker so far.... and i plan to buy 2 more....
---
I've been seeing a lot of players who never leave Watoga, they kill bots for hours. Maybe they did this to stop the endless farmers?.....IDK but the game is getting very stale when nothing spawns for normal players.
---
How much memory?
---
You‚Äôve never experienced a nuke if your game didn‚Äôt crash seconds after entering the nuke zone
---
In a row?
---
But I want Insult Bot to stay, he's the only one to come and visit me.
---
Same, I wanna paint my X-01 in my Quantum paint I have and rock that...but no calibrated shocks, not gonna use.., but I've been rocking my T-60 with calibrated shocks instead, I could swap the legs but then it'd look odd.
---
I wish MODUS sold X-01 plans.
---
I believe intelligence
---
16GB, it's only 1333Hz DDR3 granted I know it isn't anywhere near the fastest, but it was fine enough for a heavily modded FO4 and other MMO's and even newer better looking more demanding games
---
Don't feel bad... The game doesn't go out of its way to explain this to new players, and in the first couple of weeks after launch a lot of people had this problem. The important thing is you know now. If you're on PS4 I have a full set of T-60 I'll never use you can have if you want . It's unmodded and level 50, but if you want it it's yours. 
---
Thanks for letting me in on sbq....
---
Pick up rig, move next to router, plug in cable, see what happens?  Wifi can be a bitch, you'll either validate that it's not the problem or find it's causing it - either way it's a good move!
---
I need them to bring deathclaw packs back I don‚Äôt need any 1v1 I want to run into 7-11 deathclaws at a time like new Vegas and 3
---
And willards water park for flora....lots of violet
---
I think sometimes the servers get tired.  I usually server hop when things start acting funny. üòâ
---
Running SSD for hard drive?
---
do you know if there is other flora there too? i might try it 
---
According to various sources the ticket has a spawn. Presumably it's in one of the Pleasant Valley (or other Raider-controlled site) rooms.
---
Thank you!
---
I used to think the same thing. All of the servers must be dead tonight because I've tried a dozen servers and it's the same thing.
---
Negative. I expect longer loading times with a HDD and I'm fine with that, but the game's loading times seem to increase the longer I play. Only time I've had that happen was with FONV on the Xbox 360
---
I just want more weapon skins. Like the graffiti paint for the handmade fo4 style. Or a cool combat shotgun paint.
---
I posted this idea a while back. Gambling at players camps for caps wpuld be great.
---
I love this idea, I would totally send it after my friends (for caps, not atoms).
---
Absolutely. I'm pretty easy going and can roll with whatever, but this constant card swapping...this is getting on my nerves. It's not only tedious but immersion breaking as hell.
---
Gouge out your eyes
---
Go to Hopewell Cave easy spawn of 50+
---
I agree.
---
Give u 2k for blooded Tesla?
---
I could understand them encouraging certain players to go somewhere else for a change......but to kill all spawns in that area for everyone else is a bit absurd.
---
Got any 10mm pistols?
---
I could be wrong but isn't it April 9th?
---
Excavator has a bonus to your carry weight...
---
What system is New Canada on, and are your borders open?
---
Half the time my VATS doesnt work with melee. It never swings it just sits at 95% chance until I run out of AP. Or until I die because i button Smashed out of VATS and accidently open the pipboy and the enemy kills me
---
I Need in my life a Nuka Cola Faction
---
+karma 
---
There is a with the Excavator power armor.
---
You are supposed to get +100 carry weight for using it.  BUT if you log out while inside the power armor, the next time you log in you get an additional +100 (this is an error).
---
You keep the glitched extra 100 until you step out of the power armor and back in again.
---
Melee is really at a disadvantage now in PvP 
---
That would be awesome 
---
That sounds good
---
You obviously have an outstanding balance on your subscription to Appalachian Wildlife.
---
No pay, no prize.
---
You can defeat any deathclaw by pretty much walking backwards and slightly to the side. It dodges all their attacks and you can just take them out without a care in the world. It was the same way in Fallout 4. Their AI is really weak and they pose almost no real threat.
---
Idk about pc but I have SSD on my PS4 pro and it cuts my loads by a third to half 
---
Isn't displaying items in your stash coming at some point? To me that would mean being able to put the pool balls on the table like that. 
---
Damn.   Time for a complete system reset.  
---
YES.  I still do it once in a while.  It was really bad initially but getting better now.  Try playing Fo4 again you'll have the same problem from getting used to the FO76 button scheme.  
---
Yikes, I might recommend a full power cycle if you‚Äôre on console (the magic bullet for lotsa garbage) but I hope you can get this resolved soon
---
Someone just bought my last one. Only 10mm is a Two Shot, 1 star smg. 
---
I should've clarified. The initial loading times aren't bad. It's once I start playing for a little while. It's like I have to exit the game and restart it for my loading times to go back to normal. 
---
You win
---
Just don‚Äôt do it in the future lol. Other players CAN take it if you drop it. 
---
On that gatling plasma note - don't pass up on a Mutant's variant, it has that +10% damage all the time and none of the drawbacks of 1.25-shots.  I have a Mutant's fire rate variant, its an absolute beast!  That spin up tho is why I just use it mainly on the queen.
---
why did you steal my item though? beacuse 'they dont care'?
---
Get razer cortex game booster it clears up ram cache and makes your cpu run better it helped me out when I was having frame drop issues 
---
All those lights...There goes your camps entire budget...
---
Please let them build them in the ground. There's so many mountains and flat ground is difficult to come by!
---
I check the bunker daily since beta and have never seen x01 shocks available. I I finally got a jetpack a few days ago. 
---
I can craft t60 calibrated shocks if you have the mats and legs. 
---
Just violet from what I picked up
---
There‚Äôs a few combat related quests which are like kill a 1000 robots with a pistol, kill a 1000 robots with a sword etc.  Maybe some players are grinding those?
---
Well had enough space to do what I wanted with it and still have a three floor fully loaded workshop and defended farm don‚Äôt need anything more 
---
I use the shop just for the camp items because I like building. And assuming they add more hair styles in the future. I don't care about paints or skins though.
---
Also unfortunately for me today I decided to buy the $40 Atom pack so I'd have plenty to last (and I NEVER buy microtransaction stuff with real money)...And then I got double charged and they refuse to refund me. So I'm never doing that again!
---
But it's the same thing lol. They probably just renamed it after they came up with delbert and didn't delete the original asset. I know where a static spawn is for the one in game is though.
---
I'll look into that, thanks a bunch
---
Yah....found u....good fight tho...kinda felt like it was gonna glitch at anytime lol
---
I actually did find it there once, while over encumbered and walking through I believe. Let me double check...
---
is it still possible to stash TD before u first start the quest to turn them in than get one by one from your stash to to turn them in?
---
we are not sure we just know it's before the end of wild wild appalachia they didnt give specific date on that feature
---
Thank you
---
That would be great. Would that mean vertibird attacks tho ? My camp is already under constant attack from scorched, ghouls, super mutants, and the occasional robots. They dont do much damage but they do end up a pain in the ass. I even have to repair stuff every so often but a heavy missile launcher would likely help end that lol
---
I wish dude. I have astigmatism in both my eyes and that kind of effect really bugs me. Bought the division 2 and can‚Äôt even play it because all of the effects they have that you can‚Äôt turn off on the console. 
---
Ah 
---
That‚Äôs hilarious.  Thanks I‚Äôve always wondered.  
---
I bought some atoms for the first time recently. It was mostly because I rounded the 500 hour mark and have no plans to stop playing anytime soon so I felt like contributing to the future content. I didny buy them for anything specific, more just to pad my supply a bit so I'm ready for when they start dropping the really cool stuff.
---
damn. i wish there was a place to get all flora because i sell mutations and i don‚Äôt want to launch 2 nukes to get them all üò≠üò´
---
I've been working on this too.
---
I have gathered, compiled, and tested these locations from Reddit, YouTube, Google, and Facebook.
---
Hope this helps 
---
Random encounter locations https://imgur.com/gallery/0g35xkD

Two shot explosive isn‚Äôt anything anymore. Nothing more than a glorified crowd control poor mans grenade launcher 
---
Some of us need to learn things the hard way. \*sigh\* That's how I do it....
---
I hear there's a damage exploit in PVP. It may not be you. But I am not always right. Just noticed it in a YouTube video title I haven't watched yet.
---
I've turned in 40 TD in the last 3 days since learning the Paladin plan and still no Elder.  And yes I'm mildly obsessed with getting it.  Not sure what I'll do when I do lol.
---
Which doubles up upon loading into a game and is reset to the right value once you leave and get back into the PA
---
I'm all for caps to fast travel, but make more caps available from vendors in game is all that I would like to see.  I recently went nearly broke buying armor/weapon plans and really had to watch my caps until I built a buffer. Wasn't planning on spending so much but the handmade plan and mg42 showed up unexpectedly at vendors nearly simultaneously and I didn't want to miss them.... So I splurged and immediately became real picky where I wen via fast travel until I built up a buffer of caps.  Like hunger and thirst, it's annoying at first but I've grown to accept and appreciate the element as part of the fo76 experience.  
---
If you're doing any kind of rifle  build, the handmade is truly amazing. Save up around 2k-2.5k caps (price varies depending on Charisma I believe) and at level 15+ try to get someone to help you travel to Watoga to buy the plans. You won't regret it.
---
You don't happen to have a spare top hat plan do you? I've been looking for a week. I missed a day of work. Lol.
---
I wonder if the same bug applies to upgraded PA legs
---
There‚Äôs always need for more...
---
I think that's a perk.
---
So true lmao
---
Thats a perk in perception. 
---
I do what‚Äôs your offer?
---
Sounds like you know what you‚Äôre doing to me :)
---
That‚Äôs a big part of playing fallout haha - always feel like you need to make your build / character better 
---
https://youtu.be/3-gDD0qtsE4
---
It will also defrag your games and can act as a launcher I use it quite a bit. I don‚Äôt use the store they have though or any of their currency or whatever so I can‚Äôt recommend or comment on that. 
---
Changing certain perk cards will also affect carry weight. You can server hop to get that 100 carry weght gift from Bethesda back.
---
I realized tonight that it is possible to plant crops in the train wagons. Definitely a cool area!
---
leader of the Pack Event will give low level legendarys at the end boss :).
---
I just get smacked by everything Haha I just learned you could "search" containers seperate from looting. I'm trying to be a better wastelander. 
---
My 3 perception perks are the audio ones for bobbleheads, caps stashes, &amp; magazines. Neither one of us have perks that have done this before. 
---
How about hundreds of thousands of duped God shit was the death of it k?
---
I have some lemonade recipes to trade, about 1k caps, a few legendaries that are decent... A few hundred stimpacks. Hmmm...
---
I also have a ton of other plans you can look through. Take your pick. If anything interests you.
---
Best option at any point.
---
I love this idea üíï
---
It‚Äôs a perk called ‚ÄúAwareness‚Äù in Perception.  In the picture you can tell your party member is sharing a level 1 perk, that‚Äôs probably it. 
---
Try changing them to Doorways then removing them
---
Bingo
---
BE dragon? I‚Äôm loaded on plans stimpacks and the like let me load up and hop over to you
---
What‚Äôs your gt?
---
Yes this.  I have several garbage cards I stupidly got early on in the game that is completely worthless for my build.  To be fair, you don't know what you need or how the perk system works initially, so I bet everyone has a bunch of early-on game perk cards they are kicking themselves for selecting.  It would be nice to dump the exceptionally worthless ones, I wouldn't be against an exchange type of thing, but seriously doubt BSG will allow that.. 
---
Could it just be that your used to them now ? Iv been facing them sense fallout 3. The new Vegas ones were still pretty wild but by fallout 4 they were more a kin to the super mutants of old. In 76 they are just another high level enemy, tho they can do large amounts of damage to a low level player
---
No he‚Äôs sharing All Night Long. Neither of us have that perk either ü§î
---
Well double check because that's the 'Awareness' Perception perk. You might have gotten it for free from a perk pack and equipped it by accident.
---
Thought I was going to get some good PVP tips, NOPE: more half-baked ideas about game development from someone who doesn't. Can't get enough of that here.
---
Your title took up a lot of space and I didn't like it
---
These guys have enough trouble with the physics of one weapon...although I agree,dual wield pistols would be cool
---
Change the walls to doors then remove them.
---
SkippyBoJangles. I'm not on right now tho, still working.
---
No be dragon tho. I'll be on tomorrow evening for sure
---
If you look next to your team members name, the little yellow card indicates they're sharing a perk card. The specific card that is currently being shared is Awareness. Awareness allows you to see a targets resistance.
---
TIL
---
One can dream lol
---
That's damage/health scaling. Pretty much everyone is 3 shot, unless -% DR armor is equipped.
---
Nope. Have just double and triple checked. Neither of us have it. 
---
Yea I‚Äôll hold it till then when your on message me on Xbox gt communistraptor 
---
I went to whitesprings about 2am Tuesday and it spawned a bunch for me. Stood behind the bar downstairs and sliced and diced a bunch of bloated ones with my dagger.
---
I have to fast travel or server hop when it happens.
---
The build is awesome, but I'm even more baffled that you managed to write something with the letter "I" with the neon set.
---
It always scrambles up for me, I'm curious to know if you had a hard time writing this up.
---
I want a pipboy console that I and others can play the games we find on. Just think about going to someone's camp and setting the high score on their console
---
Yes I‚Äôm aware but neither one of us have the card even in our cards. He‚Äôs sharing the card All Night Long, not Awareness. 
---
That's always a possibility I guess. Older gamer syndrome:) Plus to be brutally honest in F03 I used to paralyze them with a poison dart, and ninja style hack and slash them, once I learned the needed skills, got the poison, got the weapons.
---
He did the same thing to me a week ago. You will find him laying beside the road. I got my prize junk.
---
They need endless waves of enemies somewhere.
---
Go play that snipe in the balls game
---
Sunglasses. Can't remember exactly where I got mine.
---
Interesting, you might have been in a team with someone in the past and it carried over somehow.
---
Why do you even need blueprints of your whole camp? I always thought of blueprints as ways of making repeatable structures that you would want to waste time making over and over again (IE copy and paste)  You base is already saved when you move it to a new location. Whether or not you can place the whole thing is another issue, and having your whole base blue printed wouldn't help that.
---
Use a stick lvl 1 to hit im and its solved haha
---
You know there'd be platform wide pool tournaments in less than a week. 
---
I do it all the time. At least you can open the map while in your pipboy, I just wish it worked the other way too. 
---
Morgantown is another place for flora and glow ghouls
---
This post should give you an idea https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7tb75/chart_vendor_sell_prices_vs_charisma_and_hard/
---
The trick I used, was doubling up on each letter placement, that is, stack one on top of the other, to place the following letter. For some reason, placing a letter to the right of a double-stack makes the following letter always flat with the snap.
---
Lol idk about virtabird attacks but it would be pretty kick ass to be able to build a vitrabird helipad too. Like the one at the workbench outside of Poseidon power plant. Have those 2 thing together and all the pesky little critters wont be a problem anymore lol
---
I didn't see anyting at that location. Ill try again tomorrow. I was also following this video to hunt down the plans for the civil war top hat. So far ive only found the plans for the Confederate hat
---

Damn i literally just got on here to see when that started. Oh well, next time! 
---
I‚Äôd love if it was the entire ash heap to be honest but just heavier smog and lower visibility around the border of the biome, like when you‚Äôre coming up to it from the first you can see the smog dissipate when it touches the next biome and it‚Äôs eerie like something could be in there waiting for you to enter it kinda like the show or movie The Mist. 
---
It seems confined to the Excavator Armor
---
That‚Äôs the only thing I can think of but we didn‚Äôt see someone sharing it ugh. We just were so confused because neither of us have either had or equipped the card so we were like wtf is happening yk? Lol
---
I believe it's supposed to be that way. My buddy said it's the same with Herd Mentality, some reductions just won't work as you're meant to carry around the full penalty no matter what. 
---
It's just a cost of doing business. It's essentially like four free perk cards that don't require using a pistol - well worth the added drain on survival. You can always hit up END perks to help mitigate the effects. 
---
I bought mine in either Watoga or Harpers. It was a while ago, though, before the vendor patch. Good luck! 
---
Raiders. 
---
Psn Deadsquirrelz.    Add me I‚Äôm at work for another 2 hours then I‚Äôll b on
---
76 has radscorpions?
---
Thanks! I'll remember that!
---
I think it's their animation. They've got a pounce that builds up, and then they lunch forward, but it always seems to be at the point you were, not the point you are. So if you walk back and to the side you can pretty much backwards circle strafe them. Takes a bit to get used to, but after you figure it out deathclaws will never pose a problem again.
---
Ha!  You must be an awesome and wonderful human being who loves to share encouragement and love with all you meet.  Thank you for your enrichment powers.  Charisma +5.  
---
Are you on PC? Also, could I get citizenship as an old canadian?
---
Sounds good. I should still be on.
---
Still, in F4 we have budge "cheats" and thousands of mods adding build parts and the game runs pretty smooth.
---
I'm sure F76 could handle half of this.
---
Don't forget the developers are still optimizing stuff. We just got a budget increase (sort of) and even a stash size increase. And they plan to increase more. Adding more build parts won't be a problem.
---
I'm on PS4, what you got? 
---
Doesn‚Äôt this break terms of service?
---
It's crazy to me that people would ever pay more rl money for digital items but then again people have been paying rl money for TSE guns and whatnot since launch. 
---
And yes, cosmetics are literally useless. It used to be that you'd fight some ridiculous monster that took many people to kill for a piece of useless gear that you'd only wear to show off to other people that you have it, not buy it in the cosmetics shop. Ah well. 
---
PS4 
---
I‚Äôve had this problem before, spent like 30 minutes setting up the foundations and laying the brick keypad door down with the red brick on the outside and it worked, it also worked with 1 of the walls next to it but none of the others I placed, I don‚Äôt think you were meant to place them like that
---
Agreed.  
---
It's not just events... 3* only have a chance to drop a 3*, it's never a guarantee.
---
But how do you play once you complete all the quests?
---
Farming for legendary stuff is pretty much what's left.
---
They‚Äôre half walls 
---
Its every legendary and I hate it. üòë
---
It might.
---
Yeah, but 3* Enemies usually only drop 3* items for me when I find them naturally exploring. When I complete events I never get 3* loot. 
---
üòÇ
---
U must have amazing rng
---
Unlucky I'd say. I'd say it's pretty evenly dispersed for me. Super frustrating when you go through a whole horde event to get a 1* wooden leg though lol
---
It seems that way because certain events almost guarantee a 3* spawn, running into them in the world is much more rare and thus a smaller sample size to compare with.
---
Yes, but no. I get crap effects on it. I‚Äôve only seen 2 two shot weapons total, but I find tons of ghoul slayers and hunters garbage.
---
Remember Far Harbor much? I don't want my frame rate to drop again to 10FPS with that.
---
Dear Bethesda. Please make the Gattling Laser use MFC ammo like before. Fusion Cores are too scarce. 
---
link not working
---
Level 20 Chameleon Sentinel +1 Agility (I think, need to check the third stat) leather leg. I won't be on until Thursday late night and whenever works for you on the weekend.
---
How like what perks coz I have a bloodied gauntlet with armour piercing thats sits around 300 damage?
---
yep
---
They need to create some kind of scarcity or else everyone would just save up all their earned atoms to buy stuff and not spend actual money on them. Look at the atoms you earn as a way to drop the price of something to a reasonable amount rather than just for free stuff. It seems like the new items are appearing in the store at lower cost than the original items that appeared in the store. 
---
Oh wow thanks 
---
Baited.
---
When I seek them out, or join events.  If I feel like going solo, I can usually go most of the night without interacting.  
---
The higher level I become, the more I am liking seeking others out, especially helping lower levels.   
---
power connectors. 
---
Fuck I haven't been able to launch a nuke last 5 times I tried the repair the reactor part never works right, repair all the pipes but the progress bar never fills.
---
Yep and they're quite annoying. But as OP said are quite rare
---
Nooooo I missed it. 
---
I'm annoyed they made it so much harder to build. Why do we need to build on foundations? Limits us to big blocky buildings that snap, and I don't like that
---
Fair enough.
---
Power connectors 
---
The current system favors creating a new character for different builds. leveling up to get a perk point reallocation is intended for fine tuning a build after buffs/nerfs/picked wrong special early on. 
---
Probably something to do with the code because it's not a "negative" effect. Maybe because the stat is adding hunger and thirst the perk doesn't affect it. 
---
Are we still at war with Canada?
---
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones in trade for some irradiated syrup.  Or maybe just some sweet hockey sticks with razor blades and poison.  
---
Or just some Tim Horton's donuts.
---
Glad someone else had the same idea for this location.
---
The mirelurks in the back are a problem for me but I always have fresh meat at least!
---
Level 105 and have never seen one
---
I own one on pc
---
Have any legendary hunting rifles? 
---
The real prize is the xp when you destroy it. 
---
I keep opening my map to level up
---
I saw yesterday, for a period of time.
---
Must have been something I ate/drank.
---
Following the Rules of Acquisition, oh, wrong universe.
---
I did a stealth / gunslinger build and I just die or all my stuff breaks when things look at me and can't take things down fast enough. It's really stupid. I have no interest in power armor and big weapons in a fallout game. 
---
I didn't take random perks, I designed it to actually make sense and stack damage and stuff but I feel like I can't play the game, so I don't really. Fighting high level  mobs that other people plow through feels like a boss fight. 
---
I also like the idea of movement speed based on weapon, only somewhat related; make holstered move fastest, then pistols, then slow down based on weight and/or bulk. Pistols moving faster when drawn would add at least a very slight advantage.
---
Mini games were my favorite part of the final fantasy series. 
---
Alright, that's a shame to hear as my first character i had was lv 80 and it got "corrupted" and while i sent in a ticket, they had "no ideahow/no help to give". Was hoping to have that build done by the new vault raids
---
Fuck are you using
---
You should get Starched Genes (under Luck) and start collecting mutations. 
---
I'm waiting to find out it stuff you display can be taken by other players. I want to display my weapons.
---
They did weird stuff to make it more ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù but only added things that are just annoying and don‚Äôt actually add much if anything.
---
Congrats! Someone sold a bunch to a vendor so I picked them up for less than 19 caps each. I'm gonna sell them nicely to deserving people. 
---
I've been plagued by this bug.. Crossing my finger this will work
---
Midddle mountain cabins by white springs always has 6 or so, sometimes they‚Äôre Yao gois as well, has a power armour spawn to.  They‚Äôre seems to be a legendary radscorpian  there quite often as well
---
I will help you. Add pastelpink in game.
---
People need something to do between server disconnects and crafting boiled water and food.
---
Low level ones are 14 but most of the time you‚Äôll find some level 60-70 radscorpian hunters
---
They did say they were working on something that had to do with factions at some point, although it's unclear if they meant player made factions or already made factions
---
I'm not going to wear a backpack if it removes my union soldier's backpack. I don't need more carry weight when I look cool.
---
I already have the healing factor under starched genes
---
I've got an extra copy of it on PS4
---
Lmao
---
You can nuke anywhere on the map right?
---
You can nuke anywhere you want that‚Äôs not in the safe zone
---
I found some honey beasts there. Much more worth it in my opinion.
---
You can nuke anywhere except in the large green zone around Vault 76 and a chunk of the forest region.
---
One of my friends that i play with all the time has a vats pistol build around the western revolver. He loves it, and has no issues with dps. I main a melee build and he usually ends up having to slow down to kill legendaries to make sure i get a hit in. I think he has 15 agility and luck for vats, and 15 perception for accuracy. But he has also told me that with gear his agility is somewhere around 21 to maximize AP. Only problem he has is getting a decent legendary role on them since they are pretty rare, so he has to carry multiple on him depending on what we are doing.
---
I would send it after you for taking time to make such a post 
---
What system do you play on? Might be able to help you  replace them. 
---
The mix of missile launcher and heavy laser turrets upstairs, firing through the windows makes short work of them for me. Always nice to come back to a fresh-cooked meal.
---
I will keep buying Atoms each month to support the game.   But isn‚Äôt it nice that they give the choice?   You can keep getting new free content as long as folks keep buying Atoms to keep the lights on.  
---
everyone sells serums for 250caps each.
---
no one will pay 500 just FYI :).
---
I like to go they‚Äôre after a whitesprings run, it‚Äôs honeybeasts, Yao gois or radscorpian and they‚Äôre almost always a legendary 
---
I think I just saw your message on psn. The only thing I have close to that at the moment is a exterminators pip bolt action, 3 star. I could probably modify it for you into a sniper. 
---
You can, it breaks all the objects apart and puts them in your stored items
---
Better question... how did that get downvoted so much? I'm using bloodied stuff and full unyeilding  armor set.
---
Yeah that was me, just traveled to ya
---
I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing. Thanks for telling me
---
I feel the first few levels is re learning the configs lol
---
I‚Äôll display the cat things and let you know

Pipe revolvers benefit from both rifleman and gunslinger as far as I know. My non legendary pipe revolver does more damage than a western revolver
---
If they don‚Äôt make this a feature then they clearly don‚Äôt understand that players genuinely would put their money into this game for this. It has enough traction from the players
---
Fake news! (Also a magazine doesnt spawn there ;) )
---
Well I'm a full str build, not sure if I wanna respec/dont know how, but which armor would you recommend for a nomadic melee-ish build?
---
I've long wanted this option.  So I can look at all my left arm armor options.  Or right leg.  Etc.  
---
Yes.  I'd love this option too.  But I won't hold my breath...
---
What's your current build look like? From experience you can make the explosive perks pretty low in priority when transitioning a build. If you can max out your strength and just dump into the heavy weapons perk cards it's not anymore or less tedious than starting a new character, and probably a little faster because you have the benefit of setting up strategically placed camp and have various FT points unlocked. If you have an efficient build in your current spec you can just run West Tek over and over to rack up those levels . 
---
Do you have all the shielded underarmors? 
---
Thanks, we get it- ‚Äúspend money!‚Äù ahhhh
---
ill trade that any day for being able to fast travel inside of buildings like we can now
---
Mine was piece by piece tonight, so clearly not a full fix.
---
I've seen them as low as 150. Ain't no one paying 500 caps.
---
Yeah that's how I got most of my caps in FO4 too, made it easy haha
---
Now that cloth is still useful, if you can craft it into a Civil War Top Hat
---
It definitely should affect stealth, but I‚Äôm not sure if Bethesda remembered to make it like that and made it so if it was heavy it would be worse for stealth no matter it‚Äôs weight
---
What do you play on?
---
xbox 
---
I'm too weak to kill other players
---
I love this idea, I always thought that it's ridiculous to have to constantly equip and reequip cards. 
---
Yeah dude! Remember being like holy shit if I wasnt in power armour Id be dead after he fucking body slams you!I really wish they had some kinda like grab attack again
---
I make stock sell and currently have enclave bos n marine wetsuit. I have raider but don't make and prefer not to sell it 
---
That would explain a lot. I felt like i have been eating a lot more corn soup lately
---
Yeah, it would make sense that it would, but I also wouldn't be surprised if it didn't change anything. I guess I'm just asking to see if anyone has confirmed one way or the other.
---
Agreed
---
How much for your serum recipes and what kind do you have?
---
Caps* fixed it for you
---
u/Bethesdagamestudios_ I hope you're listening
---
My Dragon only does 360 with the same build? What am I missing?
---
Same here except I'm waiting for prices to explode later :)
---
I finally found one that I killed on the street on the top of a four story building. 
---
Any time I kill one coming out of the tube that's on the road out of town where the military vehicles are, the body flies into the 8th dimension somewhere and I can't find it at all.

Didnt realize I needed this. They should have environmental effects for all zones except the forest !
---
It is still piece by piece but I felt it was much faster than before. 
---
Lol!
---
I'll buy most of them, Are you on right now?
---
Here here!
---
Sweet, I'll buy a BoS Shielded Officer underarmor. I'm joining in a sec 
---
They should keep the current drop rate the same or slightly better, but just properly mark enemies with a star. Also, all legendary enemies should have at least 1 star so they count for survival challenges. I would say to also add EXTREMELY rare 4-5 stars as the in game view implies exist, but they would probably have to overall nerf legendaries as a whole (which i also agree should happen)
---
Yes to this
---
Plants and water purifiers!  Keeps them off the ground and free from attacks.  
---
My TV is just dark on general, so indoors at night it's completely black, and dusk/morning is just red insing glare for me.
---
Why are you removing the items after the sale? Literally we need more stuff in the atom stop pulling stuff out what the fu.
---
I saw one during the beta but that was it.  
---
Wtf are you being downvoted for?? Wow people. Sometimes, like Berry mentats or targeting HUD, players in the same server may end up benefitting from another players perk who isn't in their team. I've had lucky break and serendipity trigger for many times without having them equipped. I know I don't have them equipped because I've never used them. It's a bug. 
---
Why are they removing base game items? So dumb. 
---
Join me gt u1smoothOpr8r 
---
Yep. That will do it.. üëç
---
Seriously right? These arent limited time items. Their base game items like wtf are they trying to accomplish? Pissing people off?
---
Yeah
---
Gt u1smoothOpr8r 
---
I used to be Superman! Until they patched the glitch....
---
They don‚Äôt exist on consoles because they can‚Äôt get into the dev room. 
---
Exactly! 
---
HAHA I wondered the same thing. Like what the hell lmao. I think maybe a teammate had it equipped but not shared and it just kinda gave it to us anyway. It‚Äôs only us and we‚Äôre still seeing it so it‚Äôs really weird. But we‚Äôve just never used that perk or anything so we had no idea what was happening. 
---
I agree. They should also bring at least the melee and unarmed attack finishers for players. The animation would be interrupted if you're attacked or you would be invincible until it's fully over. It would be so much fun to watch other people perform them too üòÅ
---
I really hope this works. I‚Äôve landed so many successful sneak attacks while drunk on Blackwater Brew in the last week that I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm not doing them in my sleep. 
---
good stuff yeh 500 way overpriced.
---
Oh you have no idea
---
I have seen welding helmets in game but have yet to see any welding guns, whether it be a mig welder or a tig welder. So i don't see any dual "Welding" happening anytime soon.
---
Roids... it does that to you.
---
Ign zuvembie
---
Or a "not for sale" option so u dont end up in a 5 min standoff when someone requests something youre not selling. 
---
Or just don‚Äôt fast travel &gt;;)
---
I have become death! When i spawn in, everything flops and dies including some legendaries in which i could have gotten some sweet 3* legendaries. But Bethesda's a bigger troll than me so ef it! I'll go nuke flatwoods....
---
Curious, how do you make your caps from farming?? I use green thumb for fun, and making my booze, but I've never thought of a way to turn a profit.
---
thx for the reply
---
^everytime
---
It works the same way with Ammosmith. Super duper, when it procs, only doubles the yield of the base craft amount. So if you normally make .50x100, with Ammosmith it's like .50x180, when super duper procs you get 100 + 100 not 180+180 ....i think. Hah.
---
Get a party of 24 people (split into 2 groups of 12) and all queue to join same survival server. Sounds like a blast.
---
Still "politically correct" i would say.
---
Twin lakes area is fairly good for that.
---
Only equipped with black powdered weapons as well 
---
Keep 3* max for open world, but add 4 and 5 for actual end game content like the vault raids and stuff. They would definitely need a nerf to some of the legendary effects though
---
Maybe he thought you were a working girl lol
---
Sick dude nice work! I‚Äôve got a kinda medium sized camp like yours just have been too lazy to decorate everything lol, very sick tho!
---
I feel like their goal is to get people to buy atoms, they still haven‚Äôt fixed the challenges that are broken since the release of the game and they are constantly adding and removing items from the shop for no good reason, it‚Äôs not like there are too many items resulting in an over filled shop or anything, it‚Äôs just them trying to get more money out of people at this point I believe, it started with a limited item every second day and now it‚Äôs come to them ‚Äúreturning items back to the vault‚Äù
---
If they ever allow respec, I'm changing so much..
---
Do you need either of those perks, if you also have white knight and the cirasponding one for weapons? I have all four... And I feel like I wasted points. Id rather have to repair them, and get them to 200%. I currently run luck of the draw and lucky break now, but feel like those are points that I can put into four leaf clover and serendipity.
---
Well my wanted build is  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8136ff8&amp;d=sd0su2so0sp0s01ib4ic4ar2ao0as2a04an2lt2l71lu2eh2p10c62ip2s11cu2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8136ff8&amp;d=sd0su2so0sp0s01ib4ic4ar2ao0as2a04an2lt2l71lu2eh2p10c62ip2s11cu2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=)  to utilize my stealth shotgunner/my anti armor explosive gatling, and my current build is  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1335ef&amp;d=s92sd0ss2su2so0se2sp0ar2ao0an2as2lk2lt1lu1lv2l12l71ic4c52eh2p10a03&amp;w=&amp;n=Shotgun/Fist&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1335ef&amp;d=s92sd0ss2su2so0se2sp0ar2ao0an2as2lk2lt1lu1lv2l12l71ic4c52eh2p10a03&amp;w=&amp;n=Shotgun/Fist&amp;m=)  i had all 9 points of rifleman/ concentrated fire but already took that out
---
If its on xbox, I am down.
---
I think the Gatling fun was first introduced in the civil war, just not the handheld one so that could be allowed for one member only per team? 
---
Personally as a heavy gunners build I throw out whatever isn't Vanguard or Mutants. Heck of a time getting my hands on Vanguard Sentinel (I don't race around with a 50 cal obviously) and they're very expensive on market.
---
Live in California, of course i hear strange noises. 
---
To give a small example I did the bunker buster quest and never felt invested enough into it to look around to read the environmental storytelling. A story can be whatever, but I prefer to have mine told to me directly than investigating it on my own. Fallout 4 tells a story through quests and various forms of dialogue but the majority of 76 was environmental with the dialogue coming from holotapes that you knew were made from people who died. So the ending to any story I cared about I already knew. That is how I play however. There will be plenty of people who both agree or disagree and that‚Äôs fine. To each their own. This is how I viewed it though
---
Sure.
---
1. Everywhere 
---
I now log out and bsck in by default daily when I start the Biv quests, seems to do the trick. 
---
I feel like they are ok HP-wise, but they need to deal more damage.
---
Join my world
---
Maybe it was your mistake. But this game still steals your stuff. I picked up a Cultist Dagger and Blade Sunday evening. Actually examined both. Fast traveled to CAMP and went into inventory to repair the dagger so I could gift it to my brother and both were gone. Did not sell anything. Just went to camp. Have lost other legendary weapons due to this games poor design. I like the game but this is the worst programming of any Fallout ever.
---
Xbox! 
---
All mine have 419 range. That's 3\* tse, instigating, stalkers, two shot. Is it on recent drops? I bought a bloodied too recently and it has 419 range. The ts has a hit to accuracy on all guns. The dragon has a bayonet you can put on but it reduces the stats for bashing.
---
Much as I don't want you to steal my spot here's where I camp in the Divide. 
---
Fast travel to Point Alpha. Find the fence and follow it to the cliff. Jump off the cliff (in power armor) and go approximately 100m East. You'll find a rock shelf that will accommodate at least 6 foundations. Probably more but haven't needed them. 
---
It's not perfectly flat but enough to build upon. And a pretty good view when it's all said and done
---
Yep. I get the idea behind some perk cards but in this game they really went overboard with some of them. Like, why separate gunslinger and guerrilla, or rifleman and commando? Pistols do more damage, rifles do more damage. Boom. Just saved you up to nine levels depending on which receiver is on your weapon.
---
The regular black powder rifle not the dragon. 
---
You passed the border quite a few states back
---
PC mod Better Inventory does that. Maybe Bethesda will add it to the game.
---
My husband runs a nukes on demand service, 20 minutes or less or it's free. Anywhere on the available map your heart desires. A lady hired him this weekend to drop a nuke on an area up north near some farms and the pumpkin house. It was just because she was curious about what they looked like nuked, and run around in a changed environment. It was a cost efficient way for her to have fun and enjoy the game in a different way. 
---
We get interesting requests all the time, another most recently "from Charlie to anywhere". Turns out the guy wanted to die in the nuke blast for an achievement. People are strange and that's cool. 
---
Also we can't smile during the group photo.
---
+karma
---
&gt; Rifles have a lower fire rate, but do more damage per shot for more AP, so it seems like an even trade.
---
It's not, in PVP you can Crit-&gt;Fire,Fire-&gt;Crit
---
You can also abuse Concentrated Fire much more with the higher fire rate, just break legs and leave your team to clean up around you as opposed to the rifles pick and choose
---
&gt;What I'm seeing from you is that the auto 10mm and pipe pistols are fine if min-maxed properly, and I agree that's great. But what is wrong with bringing other pistols and builds up to par?
---
 IE Single action is on par, TSE is fine, Assassins+Scopedmg is fine. 
---
I have no problems killing things in the game.
---
You're wrong about the mods for Single Action btw, it has a Prime Receiver
---
yes!!!!! and the voice acting!!! it's really quality. the bugs and non functionality still in place is what killed the game for me. (and the over priced atom store)
---
but day one the found world questing and rich story has been fantastic!!!
---
Please!
---
Thank you! I've been looking for a spot for at least a month. 
---
\*chuckles\* Nah.. I actually dealt with someone in my local town... (shocked pikachu face) and it took a fair bit of pisss farting about. But I have a NBN, that's "alright" speed. Not the speed promised, but hey. It's a start.
---
Thats when you call your bank and do a charge back. 
---
One can dream lol ._.
---
Do you know the range of berry mentats? Had an invisible player crippling me with a shotgun from a long ways away(was doing no damage just crippling) and he wasn't highlighted by my berry mentats
---
This same exact title with a similar story was posted a few weeks ago. Same dude?
---
Also fix the Tipsy agility sneak attack quest... I just snuck attacked all of Whitsprings with it not registering...
---
This guy is a legendary player (sharing legendaries).  Wish I could +karma you.  You are awesome.  Thanks man.
---
I remember more crossroads, but whatever suits you.
---
Yeah, I figured as much. And did a bit of back ground reading into it.. One moment Sony are like.. Nah, no cross-platforming. Backlash ensues, next thing we know. Sony are like, Oh we were all for it, it's Bethesda's fault. \*eye rolls ensues\* Good ol' Sony, attempting to pass the buck.
---
I get all my atoms from challenges. Just spend them wisely.
---
They should be paying the closest attention to the most iconicly original weapons. The Railway Rifle. The Rock-It Launcher. The Mini Nuke. This is basic stuff. 
---
960+ hours only found one...:/
---
Is it working now?
---
Yeah it's so bad. Coming from a handmade, felt like my bare hands were better. The choo choo was unique though. In fo4 remember it was fun to use, pin guys to the walls.
---
Oh PVS? Yeah it was just something I came up with on the fly. I'll be using it with the Trapper by the Crapper Trading post, and everyone's more then welcome to use that terminology.   
---
My question is why is it weird that I made up the PVS? :o
---
So you want to spec into heavy guns? Your current build is basically there, you already have max strength.. You just need max out all three Heavy Gunner perk cards. You'll just want to add Bear Arms and whatever you want to finish it off (I use Bandolier). You don't need all the sneak perks in agility to use heavy weapons.. Adrenaline is a must, but replace the sneaks with Action Boy and Dodgy. You might want to take from your remaining other stats (except luck) to get a bit more in intelligence and start using PA. Get max demolition expert and Stabilized at least.
---
Yes! This needs more upvote! A slight glow would save so much frustration but only if it was visible to the one that dropped it.
---
Once you reach level 50 you can move SPECIAL points around and customize your build by picking whatever pick card you want each time you level up. If I were you I would max out the other SPECIALS for the build you want and then move points around and pick other perks once you keep leveling up past 50.
---
Like what, does the Harness work?
---
***HALT!***
---
Doesn't have an option to invite party.
---
**\*Thumbs up\***
---
Daaaamn
---
I got lucky. I was running from a death claw when I was too little and happened to die there. When I snuck back for my junk I noticed it was a pretty solid locale. Enjoy, and watch out for the very sporadic Death Claw spawning in that area!
---
Sutton.  
---
It will be here for as long as I continue to play Fallout 76. Seeing as I started during the XB1 B.E.T.A, think it's safe to say. I'll be here for a while yet.   
---
**\*Fingers Crossed\*** for Cross-platforming. Then all the visitors. Yay!
---
Screw that i want the Midwestern BoS power armor
---
I once spent 30 minutes (maybe more) looking for a bag that ended up being in the sky and all that wasted time couldve been saved by a glow.
---
If you want to maximize your stable flux production you will need more than 1 nuke. It's pretty boring but whitesprings and prime fissure work really well. Whitesprings has pretty much everything but violet, and you can get a lot of the other materials. Prime site has a lot of violet and crimson, plus completing scorched earth gives you a couple random stable flux. 
---
Late responder, but did a teammate leave your team who was sharing it? If they close application or do some weird type of close, they will still be apart of the team(sometimes) and their shared card will still work. This can also sometimes lead to not being able to invite people to your team until you leave it. 
---
If you know where the flora is. Rhodenderons mostly on the golf course. The area outside the wall has more variety.
---
What platform are you on? If you're on Xbox, we can take you through the silo and help you bring down the queen! Since you know the steps to take it should only be about 20 minutes depending on server lag.
---
Keep your eyes peeled mate. You never know what you may find in your adventures. Gotta love those hidden gem typed places that appear out of nowhere.  
---
Also hopefully in the future if Cross-play becomes a thing. You'd more than welcome to come visit.
---
I got mine yesterday in Harper's Ferry. I've been hopping there looking for Excavator calibrated shocks that drop occasionally.  Most of the plans stay the same, but there are a couple that drop occasionally  
---
In some sense, yeah. I've rigged the Neon's and Garage door to work simultaneously together. Once I'm done for the day, flick the switch. Neon's turn off, and the Garage door closes, signifying another day of hard trading done.   
---
But lets be real here, I'll always be open for those trading needs, regardless.
---
I had one drop about 2 months back. I remember because no one wanted it, ended up in the vendor. I played around with it though and it sucked so bad even with the extra damage.
---
Thank-you, i think? I must admit I chuckled at your username as well.
---
I hold out hope. And hope that they release an atom shop train conductor outfit
---
Yes. Tired of junk from the three star queen in particular. 
---
Thanks everyone found it at the ski resort raider vendor
---
I saw some guy looking for one after vendor mine, was that you? xD
---
Haha, no trap my friend. Just sweet sweet deals, and a glorious throne to boot. It may not be an Iron throne, but it's a throne fit for a King, or in this case.. A Trapper. Aha!  
---
But in all seriousness, I'm a *Firebreather* at heart. 
---
You can always use my mod as well: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/233
---
I got the skin that's almost identical to that on your screenshot there.
---
Correct me if i'm wrong, but if i use the heavy gunner perks, it wont increase my explosive gatling gun, so why choose it? and for the bear arms, both my heavy weapons/shotgun weight under 8lbs each
---
I have the opposite problem. Once I kill one, its body flops to the ground everywhere I go. I fast travel somewhere thirty minutes later, walk down the road a bit, and there's a scorchbeast body falling randomly from the sky. I'll see the same body three or four times.
---
Confirming this as well, time to set the world ablaze.
---
Took me forever to do what I wanted tonight...and the damn fence gate just refuses to snap to a foundation...it is infuriating 
---
Animations need to return.  Melee/unarmed counters, melee executions, feral ghouls biting your neck out, deathclaws impaling you, all that stuff.  It should return.
---
There must be some way they can include it in a multiplayer environment and have it still work.  Some games make you invincible during an animation, other games allow you to only interrupt the animations when one of the involved are killed. Some animations could be interrupted in Fallout 4 seemingly without any issue, like the ones where dogmeat harasses a humanoid.

Game: *object is floating*

All the time. I like the new map style but after 3, 4 and NV I'm so completely used to it being in the pip boy.
---
Outfits cover all gear
---
Would run with the assumption backpacks would be covered also
---
Every time you level up after 50 you‚Äôll have the choice to pick1 of any card, or move one of your special points to another Stat
---
pick a different special then shift over to strength tree
---
When you‚Äôre selecting a special to max, you don‚Äôt have to select a card from that tree. At the bottom of the screen after selecting a special to put a point in, you can move to different specials to select a card from there. 
---
How it works is that up until lvl 50, you first select a special point and then a perk. Thus when you level up, first select a different special to boost and then using arrow keys, scroll back to the strength perk page and select whatever perk card  you desire. Hope this helps
---
Nice! I‚Äôve been using it all this evening while playing, I‚Äôm really liking it. Biggest downside is just how much ammo you can go thru really quickly. But otherwise, it‚Äôs super fun!
---
Yup, what others have said bud. Just because you put a point in say strength doesn‚Äôt mean you have to pick a strength card. 
---
i knew there was some thing like this.  i was losing more weight than i could account for, but only at certain times.  could not figure it out.  now i know.
---
danke
---
There need to be more environmental hazards.  I hope Nuclear Winter mode is a hardcore survival experience that makes survival much more deadly, and makes certain places like Ash Heap much more involved to survive in.
---
Places like Ash Heap SHOULD be hazardous.  All masks, including the veil should degrade, and in return, these places should have some resources that are worth gearing up with gas masks, and food to explore.
---
Man this would actually be so much fun 
---
 
---
i  knew there was some thing like this.  i was losing more weight than i  could account for, but only at certain times.  could not figure it out.   now i know.
---
It helps a lot, thank you!
---
I miss my fallout 4 bots. 
---
That's so sweet ! I guess you just found your guardian angel :D
---
Thanks for help guys, I really appreciate it! 
---
I did do alot of gambling in NV üòÖ
---
Does it actually say insults? All Ive ever had it do was follow me, tell me to wait and just stand there. 
---
That could be a cracker side quest actually. Break into somewhere and reactivate a robot to bring new tunes to the wasteland!
---
Been like that forever
---
They were supposed to have fixed(prevent) even being able to sell 0 vale items
---
Buuuuut, Fallout 76
---
That's all its done for me too. 
---
Perhaps I'm not operating on full information, but the Gatling Gun is a heavy weapon. It wouldn't surprise me if the perks didn't effect it though... So perhaps you're right. I'm going off my heavy weapons build that works with my .50 Cal and Minigun. If you embrace the Heavy Weapons build though Bear Arms will be essential because you will be carrying multiple heavy weapons. And I know for a fact Demolition Expert will effect all your explosive weapons.
---
They already did it in NV though... 
---
Keep in mind that was obsidian not BGS. 
---
If you want i can give you a witch mask for free
---
You don't need to pick the card from the same SPECIAL that you increase. Eg. Say you have 15 STR already but want Master Slugger, and you have 3 PER. When you level up, choose PER, then, when the card list appears, press Z (or LB on XBOX gamepad) to move to strength cards (it shows Filter(Strength) at the bottom) and choose Master Slugger).
---
Another way for me to lose caps. 
---
Mirelurk, but it's as good as it sounds.  Mutated dried crab.
---
That's exceptionally unlikely as it would be a move that pisses off a whole lot of players and would run counter to Bethesda's plans to sell more outfits to people. It's neither impossible or even that hard to make gear visible over outfits, there were plenty of mods for it for 4 especially mods that added visible backpacks. 
---
I appreciate that, but I got me a witch mask on one of my few Fasnacht runs (which I sorely miss doing).
---
Alright, thank you for the information. I have yet to find a difinitive answer on if an "explosive" heavy weapon counts as an explosive, or if the non explosive perks work. I assume they wouldn't work though. With bear arms in mind I would only be carrying 1 heavy weapon atm, and a backup shotgun both w/ 90% weight reduction so fully modded they weigh 6lbs and 9lbs. That's why i was questioning bear arms until i find a 3star fatman. 
---
Ill buy if your on Xbox 1!!
---
As a lvl 270 avid camp builder, yes and yes. Camp budget doesn't increase, but rather the costs of items decreases. However, they are logged at a price when they are created. You'll need to reput it all down for the budget cost change to be noticeable.
---
TEST IDEA Try making a char with a maxed out lvl 1 camp. Then get to 100 to test scrapping it, and,replacing thr exact same camp and note if there is budget left over.
---
Instructions unclear.... 
---
Everytime I play
---
I always upvote for less restrictions, they were put in to stop these crazy "immersion breaking" camps but it didn't work, now all it does is stifle creative CAMP building and cause other inconveniences like the one you have said about 
---
It will give me something else to kill in peoples camps. It‚Äôs not my fault I need leather, and circuit boards. 
---
Hey I might have those weapons. If not what would you take for caps for perfect storm. I miss that gun loved it 
---
I have a camp nearby, as well! I‚Äôll be enjoying the idyllic scenery and calming sound of a babbling stream and then I‚Äôm startled every time by that blood-curdling scream! It‚Äôs creepy but entertaining. 
---
It looks like it belongs there.  A silver for you sir because you put it over the top with the Clerks quote. (although technically it's shoplifting on [the sign](http://www.viewaskew.com/profilesauction/images/registersm.jpg), not stealing.)  Close enough.
---
I had an issue with this. If you are stuck where I was here is he solution I found. Up the road (hill) from the dam in the mire there is a sigm, next to the sign is a little metal pole. You should be able to activate the (I think its called a sensor station?). After you do, quest should turn back on, and be on track again.
---
Yeah I am on Xbox. but won‚Äôt be back on till 5pm est
---
Watch, it's some buggy thing based on something completely different (like your general buffs/debuffs). I mean remember that patch that had the radworm glitch?
---
I think maybe a previous teammate had the card equipped but not shared and it just kinda kicked in for us both and is still stuck like that even after the team was just the two of us again. Ya know how some perks will do that? I just wasn‚Äôt sure lol. 
---
I always thought putting a deathclaw in the first encounter was a mistake in F4. I didn't fear them so much when I'd already been presented with armour and a weapon to kill one in the first 25 minutes.
---
33 year old Mom here that has no friends that play, is a huge Fallout fan, and would love to play with you ladies! I'm a level 29 and am currently exploring Appalachia to try and get enough screws to finish the Excavator Armor for Miner Miracles üòÅ
---
If I could hack an eyebot, I would be ok if you found it and murdered it. Better than not being able to get it at all.
---
No shit. So I've been waiting my time equipping that damn perk card. Wtf.. thanks for letting me know that. 
---
Your RAM is a bit on the low side and the stuttering may be related to a failing HDD.
---
Next time I log in, I'm so correcting the wording. How could I have missed that, I must be slipping in my old age! And thanks for the silver!
---
Huh...guess I never needed to buy something for 0 caps til now...
---
Oh well, as long as it‚Äôs known. 
---
Thanks
---
Kk I need to save up caps anyways so I can get it by then
---
&gt; Deathclaws used to be a fairly tense challenge even for the endgame players and presented a real since of pride when you took them down back
---
Nah man in FO4 my melee character could 2 shot them at level 23, and my other character could 1 shot them with a shotgun. You just need to know how to use your weapons right.
---
This would be cool. As they are now, everything in the vendors is way too overpriced to ever spend caps on.
---
Deathclaws don't seem to spawn much except at a few pre-determined locations.
---
It's nothing crazy, but I have about 25 mutfruits growing in a pin outside of my house. With Green Thumb I can earn up to 50 through harvesting and sell them for 2 caps a piece with Hard Bargain to a vendor. I usually earn 100 caps every hour or so.
---
Also, Green Thumb helps with collecting Soot flowers and I usually sell those for 1 cap each. 
---
As I said before, it ain't much but it's honest work.
---
Mines more of a niche, but :
---
Mutated bloodied melee, with low HP.
---
5-600 both resistance (no power armor), less than 30% hp, serendipity, all mutations. 
---
I eat spoiled food, drink dirty water, and have 70% rads for radicool to kick in.
---
Any horde event in the forest area should give you a low level legendary.
---
Personally, when I get low level legendaries that are decent, I drop them in the overseer's cache in Flatwoods.
---
I'm in a habit of waving bye and logging out after a buy. That way it's saved and there's no rollback if you disconnect.
---
Seriously. I've been playing for months with this perk and finally felt like it wasn't worth it, took it off, and realized I was finding the same ammo. I thought the perk was just broken this entire time.
---
You guys just math'd the shit out of 200 caps at each vendor. Thank you for that. Now if you can get them to carry more than 200 caps 
---
Hard drive is still at 98% health according to hard drive sentinel (other games would have sinilar problems  if that was the case too) and I know my ram is a bit on the low side but that shouldn't matter too much since speed doesnt how much of an impact on performance 
---
Gad. You're the reason....
---
You can already tame animals, you need three points into the animal friend perk and a bit of charisma (depends on the animal) and you can tame stuff, they stay at your base and defend it. Hell, you can even tame scorchbeasts
---
That was the most math'd shit I've ever seen. Holy crap. 
---
I thought his quests were bugged, and he wouldn't give them out. He actually gives you quests? I was wondering how you'd ever get the other alcohol recipes.
---
Clean ANY walls.  Brick looks so nice on the outside but the insides just don't do it justice. I should be able to make a damned bastion of grace and civility in the wasteland, Bethesda.
---
Sounds good
---
 but only stay in the camp 
---
It literally says in FO3 and FONV... what are saying? Of course they were easy in FO4, you fought one in the very 1st mission. 
---
Maybe if you want to try another base style for a bit. Like I like my house, but I've been considering putting my camp on some bridge and making a "toll booth" sort of thing (powered gates, walls, searchlight), well more a military checkpoint.
---
They just need to give Ross some music. Her commentary is hilarious. 
---
THANOS FROG THANOS FROG
---
If u pick one item up, like a bobblehead, and there is a magazine around, can u still server hop and re-roll the magazine?
---
Not with Maxed Starches Genes, which is a perk from Luck.
---
I took it off recently and decided I'd just put on Class Freak since I'm shuffling around my build and since I have ammosmith and super duper I'm not as pressed on as I was with ammo
---
Thanks guess I‚Äôm grinding some levels for the permüòÇ
---
It only takes up two points. 
---
At least you got some weapons lol. It happens to us all. These past few days I've netted some pretty good weapons and armor from un-nuked Whitesprings around 4pm EST. At least a dozen each day. But it seems to die off as the evening progresses. Maybe because there are more people on the server. Dunno. But 4pm is definitely the sweet spot. Out of my drops I netted several 3* weapons and armor to include some sentinel pieces and one TSE
---
2 for the card, 2 for the special.
---
Yea I know I have the first tier of it
---
Demo expert and bloody mess. 
---
Had the bug with the sneak attack ones. I took off all my armor, 5 unyielding pieces and it worked, no server refresh needed. Been doing it that way since with no issue, one of those pops up, I pop my armor off, complete the task, put the armor back on and report to Biv
---
If you need help modding your armor let me know
---
Can you attach roof pieces to it, and build a bridge to another section of building using the roof pieces. Then try deleting that half wall. Then delete those new roof pieces to clean up.
---
Iiiiiiiit's Fashnacht Day... 
---
Again!
---
I would be happy if they would just fix the blueprinting. I latterly have a micro base. It sits on a 4 tile foundation and it‚Äôs two levels. I can‚Äôt even blueprint half of it. 
---
When you say "24 hours", is that in game time, or real time?
---
Serums are controlled mutations, you know what you're getting. The main difference is that for the first hour there are no bad side effects, after that, the perk Class Freak is useful at it's top level. To keep the mutation, you need Starched Genes perk. Both of these are luck perks. I suggest you have a look at some YouTube vids regarding mutations, and maybe they'll describe it better than I can.
---
That was perfect thank you
---
I have already tested this thoroughly myself. I did a full rebuild (including scrapping all of my decor before the rebuild) and the place was the same after 20 levels. It was very thorough, I even wrote down every single item on a list. It took hours. Nothing changed. There was no increase... the item costs did not decrease. 
---
I have seen so many people saying what you claim, and other saying that budget increases. None of you are offering a shred of evidence. 
---
So that's the reason for this post. We need Bethesda to step in because I'm sick and tired of wasting my own time with testing and trying to convince people that absence of evidence is not a good basis for making an argument or giving advice. xD
---
I recently spent a bunch of time looking for a spot to camp in the Savage Divide.
---
I found most of the nicer flat spots to be on the hills bordering the Savage Divide, you'll occasionally catch nice largish flat rock ledges cascading down the hill, that could likely fit 2+ buildings with 6 or 8 foundations. 
---
I would entertain trying it out. Like he said above, don't underestimate the bloody build. 
---
They already sell both outfits and armor paints in the Atomic Shop, and you can't show off both at the same time.  Doesn't seem like much of a stretch that they'd make outfits cover backpacks just like armor.
---
Nice post. Thanks.
---
I can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs floating next to a tree
---
Real time.
---
It could be that. When I first heard these rumours I also thought they might be true, because I had noticed I was getting more out of my camps as I leveled. But then I realized that there are other variables coming into play, like using items that are cheaper or having 'lost' budget from pets or wires freed up... which would then lead to people assuming the overall budget improvement was due to leveling. 
---
So yea, unless someone records hard video evidence, this issue is not going to go away. We really need Bethesda to step in because I am going to be really annoyed if I keep seeing folks potentially wasting their time destroying their own bloody camps on the unfounded advice of strangers. xD
---
Even with 3 ranks of Class Freak, Speed Demon is the only mutation where the penalty just isn't worth it for me.  I hotkeyed both purified water and dog food, but running out of them regularly and having to re-favorite was a dealbreaker.  Luckily I only had two other mutations at the time and a few in-game acquaintances were willing to make me most of the serums for flux or totally free.
---
I kinda miss the reload speed, but it's not hard to survive without it, especially as a melee character.  Speed Demon is more of a convenience than a necessity, kinda like Marsupial, only Marsupial doesn't have an incredibly irritating drawback.  
---
I'm pretty sure than on a stealth build, the faster movement also makes you less stealthy.  Once I dropped Speed Demon on my sniper, I stopped having a lot of the problems of being easily detected.  I would press caps lock to "walk" slowly so much that the mutation was basically worthless aside from the reload boost.  I do miss that, but again it was mostly a convenience.
---
Pro tip: if you have 2 perk points to play with, pop 2 ranks of Gun Runner into agility and find a pistol to swap to while walking around.  It gives you +20% movement speed without needing to guzzle water every 2 minutes.  My slugger melee character uses pistols as a backup ranged option and it's the best two perk points I ever messed around with.  I can outrun players that aren't wearing power armor and keep up with power armor users that have speed demon.
---
Alternately, if you play in a group or happen to join one for whatever reason, swap out Lone Wanderer and pop in two ranks of Squad Maneuvers for the +20% movement (inspirational, field surgeon and tenderizer are other great team-based choices).  It doesn't stack with Gun Runner or Speed Demon, but is a fantastic perk if you make a couple pals that you group up with regularly.
---
Someone found the vendor multiple times with a camp on top of Charleston. It was fake news.
---
I think the same thing may have happened to me... but possibly with just one or two quests.. but still, and hey don‚Äôt give up yet! The new dlc‚Äôs should be worth it, and it‚Äôs always fun to make a second character just make sure not to do it again if you do give it another shot xD
---
&gt; \#1. Camp Venture Secure Storage 
---
Every intact building in Camp Venture also has a chance to spawn blueprints. There's one that spawns under the technical data drop off on the shelf by the floor, one in the barracks by the kitchen, one right as you walk into the command center, and two that can spawn in the locked armory with the security cage.
---
The trailer had a human actor dual wielding smgs
---
It's easier to buy them honestly 
---
Yup!
---
Correct.
---
Biv is a fucking great addition to the game, I love both him and Grahm.
---
True, and you are welcome!
---
It was on Xbox One. And yeah sure!
---
Oh cool thanks
---
I was going to call bull on its Canadian-ness until I saw the Tim Horton's.  Well done, Canucks!
---
Congrats on getting the traveling leather coat. Now you need a green hood to make the outfit completely badass. And your character completely bald no matter what hairstyle you're sporting.
---
Good add. I didn't even bring those up because I was focusing on concentrated bunches of stuff, but it's probably worth giving those a peek too while you are there so long as you don't have to spend too much time fighting ghouls/scorched. :)
---
No, Radiation has it‚Äôs own resistances. It‚Äôs the Nuclear symbol in the item stat screen.
---
I have a crossbow sneak build. Dubbed the Lara Croft special. 
---
A broadsider/shishkebeb build called the siegebreaker. 
---
A BPR/P pirate build. 
---
A 30‚Äôs gangster/mobster
---
Lastly a 50‚Äôs greaser. 
---
Gary
---
Gary?
---
Your welcome! :)
---
No not since you invaded us you crooked-nosed knave
---
I've just started seeing a bunch recently. 
---
They we're the wave of mobs when I took Hemlock Holes workshop the other day.
---
And 3 times yesterday they were in locations where the messenger event ended.
---
I hates them. In all fallout games. They feel like they take a beating, to kill.
---
Your last name's not Petrovita by any chance, is it?
---
This is just flat incorrect. Weaker yes. But still very very powerful.
---
Since "Two Shot" got nerfed, maybe they can add a "dual wielding" legendary perk to pistols.  Double the damage, but costs double the ammo.  Would only be available for truly one handed pistols, having it on pipe pistols would be complicated if someone modded a rifle stock.
---
Makes a lot of sense. I'll be trying 
---
Are you not appreciating the 16x detail and better lighting?
---
I know someone tried a while ago but got contradictory responses and such. Like they took screenshots and such.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a77cs6/psa_proof_that_camp_budget_does_not_change_with/
---
There's only one, maybe two, guaranteed spawn points for the BOS mod plans and, even then, it's a super rare drop. Course, it's the best combat armor material mod, so we can't expect it to be easy to find.
---
If I don't find anything by then I'll hit you up. 
---
Fallout players are awesome. Love that they cared enough to grind the data and that they shared it with the rest of us.
---
It‚Äôs just incredibly imbalanced. If they have sentinels good luck enjoy that interesting gameplay. If they have marsupial enjoy that fortnite shotgun gameplay. It‚Äôs just a total mess rn and nothing will did it but but gear balancing and weapon/stat tuning.
---
You can also farm rare creatures in certain spots where they are guaranteed to spawn. Occasionally they drop good loot.
---
We‚Äôll be back tomorrow!
---
if you're going to add a game, do it better than others... and in the case of pool, pool nation FX already has the pool market owned. if anything they could add an interesting twist to darts or something.
---
Back out or buy something supper cheap. If you haven't sold to that faction already then it will fix it. 
---
Ahh, how I wish more Xbox players migrate to pc.
---
The game is actually p.good on pc and 4k60 on max looks fresh
---
Did the Insult Bot come along at the same time as the lemonade stand?  If so, someone at BGS missed their calling as a comedy writer.  I laugh every time I find the lemonade stand and Mr. Squeeze enthusiastically, then less enthusiastically advertises their finest quality......uhh................"ingredients".
---
The robco event has dropped 3* for me before and also 1* wood legs. Mostly wood legs...
---
you're talking morals about bgs? have you played fo games? even the jokes from insult bot are horribly distasteful (and I love that about BGS). besides, online experiences and updates don't have to conform to ESRB or whatever afaik, plenty of games add content that make the esrb need to reevaluate down the line.
---
I'd be pretty pissed if my boss kicked me
---
It's good to limit requests to actually obtainable things.
---
I see what you did there. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
It's the stupid little stuff like that which makes camp building more frustrating than it needs to be.
---
I've built a camp under a giant beavers dam, or pile of wood thing that is in a particularly deep trench in the bog, the roof over the middle is made up by the pile. 
---
So I've got a row of foundations running along the trench, a hallway that connect the two ends. 
---
AND YET FOR SOME UNGODLY REASON I CANNOT BUILD ANYTHING ON ONE OF THEM BECAUSE "ITEM CANNOT BE PLACED IN WATER"!
---
It's really irking me. It's like ankle deep water. the foundations isn't even close to being flush with the water....I can raise the foundation and build on it..... But then I can't fit under my log roof. 
---
Yeah that's happened to me before.
---
That was some pretty amazing stuff honestly. Really blew my mind. All I know know is HB =9 and max charisma is 11. Good to know. Need 20 with my bloody build and I'm golden. Still amazed 
---
Funny you should link that. The video part of that post was the reason why I decided to test for myself, when someone else linked it to me-- I didn't like that the person who did the experiment used a small number of items and a lot of turrets. So I took a similar, more controlled and varied approach. My results were the same as theirs-- there were no changes. 
---
Anyway thanks for linking. Maybe someone will take up that poster's challenge and actually provide evidence to support the contention that started the whole debate. :-p
---
Wood legs, arms, Chest pieces, this game doesn‚Äôt like me too much.
---
I used to collect pre-war money and then fill a bathtup with it
---
Where is the guaranteed spawn for it then? 
---
I find monsters never drop plans, with the exception of lvl 80 scorch beasts and of course the Queen, but you can server-hop Deathclaw Island and farm that deathclaw for gears, black titanium, and sometimes uncomon weapons. The other monsters work similarly. The Grafton Monster by Poseidon is worth around 20 caps per kill and always pays for my travel there.
---
Stripz has it right.  I still think the BP limit should be increased to CAMP limit though so any building I make is movable. :)
---
Agree. Just yesterday noticed that one of the loading tips in Ash heap actually mentions permanent mist/smog obscuring vision. 
---
Hey, one thing you could do is put everything in storage, screenshot it with budget cost and level. Then have other people try to do the same and compare budget costs and levels. That way we can see if camp budget is variable at all really (if different people come up with different costs for same items, we know there is SOME variable at play). Crowdsource the data gathering.
---
That would be horrible.  Eek. Sorry you went through that, lol
---
I was talking about how if we add gambling in Fo76 it may be seen as true gambling. As players would be gambling against other players and not a player versus machine like we had in FoNV.  Granted the caps are a non physical currency. Unless people are actually buying caps with real money. 
---
i'd say that's not even 10% of them... The thing is, random encounters can happen in so many more locations in the overworld... Just travel and you'll realize some things that seem like they actually fit so perfectly were actually random events if you come back to that spot and see something else now.
---
Enclave supports this claim.
---
You on PC?  If so, I look forward to perusing your selection.
---
I'm actually looking to organize groups of RPers playing different factions and work to get groups together in the same server. Do you guys have any interest in that? Would be great to have more dedicated RPers to help build stories with. 
---
Another thing I thought of, some fissures have megasloth corpses that always spawn with like 15-20 caps on them. I'm pretty sure fissure site prime has 2 of them that both spawn with caps.
---
I expected it to be kinda schiesty, it is from Bethesda. I wish there was a perk that let you build more for your camp though 
---
The term guaranteed and super rare don‚Äôt belong in the same sentence. If there was a guaranteed spawn they wouldn‚Äôt be super rare and so far, only super rare describes the drop rate of bos mod plans. 
---
It's getting more and more into a playable state for people who care about such things :)
---
From someone who‚Äôs been playing sense just after Beta. The short answer to that question is yes. There are still a bunch of problems but the game is at lest playable at this point. 
---
I can't believe no one has said it, but you are all wrong. They need to bring back caravan. I lived that game. I would love to play against other people and be able to bet caps or loot on hands of caravan.
---
It's not possible to buy caps for real money, any attempt to would break the terms you agreed to.
---
Well thats good to know thanks for the reply.
---
I‚Äôve never waited 30 seconds for either of those situations when running thru silos 
---
Yea that's what I was thinking. It would be best with a good range of levels and mics to coordinate and video to stream or whatever.
---
Even still, people could do it and I think this rumour would still persist. That's why I was asking for mods in the settlements reddit to pin a topic about it. 
---
Oh. That just hurt to read haha. I was hoping for in game time lol.  Thanks for telling me though
---
North side of Grafton Steel, Western of 2 buildings, on locker shelf next to the armor bench.
---
Cool, I'll have to see if I can get the arm plan to spawn there for me, that's the last one I need. Thank you 
---
Gaaaaaarryyy
---
He gives you pre war money (cloth), which can be combined with acid to make gunpowder
---
I said guaranteed because it will show up. It just has a super low chance to spawn (at best).
---
Dense and pneumatic plans are also super duper rare. 
---
Great post can't wait to jump on and try this out üòé
---
The events that take place now help, and having a content drop forecast is great too. Moving PvP to its own play mode helps with casual and PvE players as well. There are little to no dupers or hackers, stash size has increased, and will increase further soon, camp limit now allows for much larger or more detailed builds too. The economy is picking back up which is awesome 
---
That's not what I meant.
---
I just don't see the point of having a BP limit smaller than CAMP limit because it severely limits the size of the main structure, which is what I want to BP.  I couldn't care less about having to place my outer walls/fences back down - I actually enjoy that part.
---
It's my house I want to be able to blueprint.  Small houses are nice, but I like my CAMPs to look aesthetically pleasing.  And in the early days with bugged blueprints, I got used to making a super nice pad that I just redeployed and then added outdoor embellishment to. 
---
The blueprint limit as it stands now is too small for even a 2x2x2 floor house if you decorate it at all beyond crafting benches and a bed and stash.  It's fine for making temporary settlement structures, but utterly useless for CAMP moving.  I almost never move my CAMP now because of having to build an entirely new house (plus I get attached to houses and know I'll lose them when I move).
---
Yeah this bug has gotten worse lately. Relogged 3 times and it still didnt work. Eventually just gave up
---
Welcome, plan on a LOT of server hopping unless the rng gods are with you
---
Didn't we have slot machines in fallout 4 ? Only this time make them really work with caps n all.
---
hotfix yesterday and its still not fixed.  a joke
---
It's probably better for new players at this point. Way more stable, quality of life upgrades and a strong community that loves nothing more than helping out new players. Also the added bonus of people imparting the wisdom they've accumulated since launch. 
---
I got random items getting duplicated on my inventory , weapons disappearing , can‚Äôt move my power from my inventory, my weight reducing armor seemed messed up too.
---
Had to stripped naked and log in naked every time to sure 
---
Only at a few select locations I think. Either way, the majority of West Virginia using cola caps instead of money for a whole day, week, whatever, is pretty unrealistic. I mean not that fallout has to be super realistic, but it would be cool if pre war money actually had a use, and one would think that if it ever had a use pre-war, it would be soon after the bombs fell. 
---
Thanks!
---
Good luck!
---
Granadier on perception ? I believe it benefits for duplicating radius of explosion 
---
Thanks Bethesda for a nice do able challenge 
---
I'd like to add that the chainsaw also does not benefit from any Melee perks. 
---
Was this ever fixed? I'm pretty sure the people before my team fixed posiden cuz all the little power boxes are green. But if I go out to a settlement I cant get power there 
---
You‚Äôre better off in 51b it has better damage resistance. Probably a TSE, so you might just be shit out of luck with sneak attacks
---
Haha, Gary!
---
Hell yeah come join the fun!
---
It‚Äôs possible depending on what the other legendary effects on the weapon are. So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a bloodied, explodie, with 40% more damage when sited. Depending on were you run your health it‚Äôs well within the realm of possibility for them to one shot you. 
---
there is no reason lockpick, hacking, bartering prices, etc should use perk slots, theyre just annoying to use
---
You could do the horde events in the mire. 
---
Also a level 3 safe next to the vendor in Harpers Ferry, second floor of the half destroyed house next to him.
---
A resounding yes in all accounts.
---
Yes to 'purple boxes'.
---
Yes to endless ivory grips.
---
Yes to miriads of Motion-assisted servos.
---
Also yes to ultra-light marine limbs and torso. Those are not depicted but still a yes.
---
Yeah I really don‚Äôt get people who miss the story. Honestly I‚Äôm even the oddball that doesn‚Äôt miss npcs and I really don‚Äôt get why you need npcs for story (ended up arguing with some one who thought it had no story and one of his arguments was there was no npcs to give story). One of my favorite things about bethesda games (and obsidian did this right too honestly) was the finding out of story by finding bits and pieces that start putting together a bigger picture as you get more. 76 is chock full of this. One of my complaints about 4 is it is really lacking in this. In fact writing wise I‚Äôd take the no NPCs but strong story in the notes and computer entrie you find in 76 over the bland main story of 4 with not much story in notes as even 3. I mean it had some but 4 was missing it a lot and that was one of the things I think bethesda does well. 
---
Well, not all of them, remeber some pretty much either died out, or like you said, there might be people in it
---
Mirelurk Queen. 
---
Let people play on whatever platform they want to. I was xbox for a long time because of two conditions: most of my friends were on xbox, and I didn't have the money to spare for a decent PC. I, and likely many other, understand that PC is technically superior to consoles, but that doesn't make them overall better. The past week of me troubleshooting division 2 rather than playing with friends has taught me that the hard way.
---
How do they enjoy any bethesda fallout game?or hell,  Bethesda game. Bethesda games strength is all in the exploring and the sidetracking you with, ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù If you just go from marker to marker in any bethesda game I‚Äôd find it boring. 
---
dupe it and do both!
---
TSE is very rare, and there's nothing specific you can do to up your chances of getting one. That being said events that usually have 3* include Uranium Fever, but also AWOL Armaments, Horde Events and One Violent Night. Also TSE is overrated, and was so even before the infamous nerf. There are equal and superior rolls you can get. 
---
Gary!
---
I have only been playing for a few weeks. I am not a real "gamer" compared to a lot here -- dabbled in half a dozen games but got really into fo4 last year and found a copy of 76 online for $15.  So I thought I'd try it out.
---
I have mixed feelings still.  I really do not like the fact that I cannot have control over the level of enemies I come across.  Could be same level, or much MUCH higher at random.  
---
I think the whole uncertainty when I play has left me feeling "meh" about it.  But I do really, really appreciate the other nice, generous, helpful players.  They helped make the game worth playing for me.  
---
One word for you... Troll. "Help, help, I'm being oppressed"... "The gay card didn't work".... "Try the racist one".. enjoy your lonely sad existence... I can hear you crying into your keyboard from here.........
---
Pay attention to your drops. Like really pay attention. Before you pass/sell them you need to look at the modifiers. Now that I know what I'm looking for I know I've sold many weapons/armors I should have used or kept. 
---
As for TSE weapons. Good luck. I'm alevel 145 now and I've only dropped one and wasn't a part of my build so it was useless to me. Most of what I've got I've had to buy. 
---
But looking back, I've definitely offloaded stuff I shouldn't have. Like AA weapons, certain mele, and sent/Cav pieces. I kick myself in the butt everyday because of it. 
---
I don‚Äôt usually feel much pressure to get anything done by certain levels myself. I launched my first nuke around level 50 when finishing the main quest solo, and haven‚Äôt done another since so many are usually on the map already. After the main quest, I just mainly focus on making my camp look good and getting my build better as I get higher in level. Lvl 120
---
How would this fit into the lore? The world is dead and irradiated and the water twice as much. Anything that didn't die in the blast mutated already. Squirrels aren't even squirrels anymore mam
---
Do you really some people are scared of the ToS?
---
It‚Äôs really not hard to set up something to just that. 
---
You'll know you are at your peak build when you can clear the Golf Club, West Tek, a Mirelurk Queen and a Scorched Beast without too much trouble.

Strange part is there was no DC. I just fast traveled back to CAMP from the location I picked the items up at. And they were missing from inventory.  One time I was killed by 2 scortchbeasts while using an All Star Super Sledge I had just aquired the day before. When I came back it was gone. Like I said. Game has a habit of eating good weapons.
---
Swim under the water, there are already fish underwater in the game
---
Use the fire perk its explosion resistance 
---
Tempting, but I want other people to see it, too. The point is that I'm trying to RP an Enclave officer. 
---
I'll sell ya a full set of unyileding all with deep pockets. I think my carry weight was over 400. 
---
&gt; I wonder if it‚Äôs tied to IP addresses, i.e. you‚Äôre always assigned to one of the nearest servers,
---
That's how Amazon works.
---
&gt; if there are only a few servers in certain area
---
There are as many servers as are needed for the number of players.
---
You've got to remember there are no physical servers, they are virtual machines in Amazon's cloud.  New servers will be created as more users log on, old servers will be destroyed as people log off. 
---
Guess you could call it a NotFix
---
There's a civil war PVP event that has two sides fight each other. I've never seen people actually show up to fight though.
---
Maybe I should go around and try to find all the billiard balls for mine...
---
Walk around town with my Enclave assaultron companion.
---
G... gary?
---
Keep in mind that uranus fever drop max lvl 40 stuff. The day you get an awesome drop its worth a lot less
---
I wouldn't know, don't have the game yet. Been hoping to get it soon
---
I did this too, I used OC Decorator with it so they wouldn't fly everywhere when I loaded in.
---
Probably because everyone assuming you are using duped weapons.  " I'm using bloodied stuff and full unyeilding  armor set". Bloodied, Vanguard and Sentinel are the new TSE in duping circles.  Anyone who one shots level 94 deathclaws (glowing or not) has an OP weapon. Nothing wrong with that. OP weapons are what everybody wants to have drop for them.
---
But since those are super rare. Having a full set and two OP weapons scream traded or bought weapons.  If traded or bought, then most likely it's a duped weapon. Such is the state of broken economy that dupers bring and saltiness from people who view that as cheating.  If they dropped for you naturally, then you are super lucky and saved a lot of real money or in-world caps, but will be suspected of being a dupe weapon owner unfairly.
---
No they are not, go swim underwater, they are already in game
---
NPC interaction has always been my least favorite part about the Fallout series gaoing back to Fallout 1. I think that adding human NPCs is a dumb idea, and hope that the Wastelanders DLC isn't going to add this as some have speculated.
---
BOS combat armor mod plan no longer appear at vendor, can try event and treasure map to get them.
---
For BOS Uniform etc, try the flooded train station next to Watoga i got Soldier and officer bos plan on the same session there (Lucky).
---
One spawn in the a train wagon on a shelf the if im remember correctly follow the rail from watoga and it should be the second or third wagon on your right, the other one is in a little warehouse on weapon or armor crafting station.
---
My whole build is based on using weightless armor. Here's a link to check out real quick.

God rays and other volumetric effects are the new render fog. The more that's obscured by pretty beams of light, the less of the environment behind it has to be rendered out.

Fallout had a rich wealth of environmental storytelling previous to its Bethesda days.

Were lucky that Fallout ended up in such kind company.

Stackable spiral staircases. I'd pay money. (Your welcome Bethesda) 
---
Hi. Do you know what event? I‚Äôm on PS4 and would love to get the Helmet.
---
To make sure I understood your comment, what you said is that you haven't played any other online post-apocalyptic open-world games besides Fallout 76? 
---
Appalachian Antiques near Fort Defiance has a lvl 3 Floor safe behind the counter when you walk in the front door. There's also a magazine that can spawn on said shelf as well as a bobblehead on the broken roof that you can walk on. I've found the plans for a Gauss Rifle, Gatling Plasma and the Railway Rifle in it.
---
Someone just sold me the helvita banner for 25 caps then a broken old toilet for 40
---
I agree. I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of being on a team with someone they stole a nuke. It needs to be looked at. 
---
well.yeah..but you can still use it also lol
---
There‚Äôs no radium Rifle here 
---
Nah I saw this dude running around gunning everyone down. He was dying too but Im level 113 and wondering why I can get one shot by a gun with such a large clip :'(
---
I knew about that one, but now so does everyone else! This is what I was trying to encourage. Thanks! ;)
---
I love this! Great reference haha. How do you get upstairs, or is that bit just for aesthetics?
---
If we can't wear them, what about a kill score/trophy board for our c.a.m.p.? Give us a corkboard we can stick them in; hold 50 per board or something.
---
The only thing I dislike are the tests and annoying ass quest like that blues one where you have to get your military id. Shits annoying
---
I remember the very first time I wandered into the ash heap, my health started declining and I had no Idea why. I just sprinted as fast as I could slamming stimpacks to keep from dying. I had to ask another player why my health did this so I found a gasmask pretty quickly so I could go back to the ash heap and scrounge around. So a visual clue definitely would help.
---
I love this idea, anything to bring more diverse player interaction at camps. Especially if they are designed with other players being able to spectate in mind.
---
I ran the whole thing solo and he came in as the launch chiefs were in progress. I was pissed when he just slapped another keycard in and was able to launch anyways.
---
Adventure mode is not PvP free though
---
Switch servers 
---
 thank you
---
More rad storms to. 
---
I've wondered why the Robotics Expert perk doesn't work the same as Animal Friend for a while now. 
---
The only conclusion that I can come to is that instead of an Animal Friend-like perk, we might just have an entire FO76 Automatron-like DLC some day where we can build our own robots instead, which would be way better.
---
Over 1k of play time and I still have fun. super excited for new content and fresh cans of dog food.
---
the 'darker yellow bar' is item condition. The white line over the top is its over repair status. Until they yellow bar goes down its still in perfect condition.
---
Psn is xSmD_Trance. DR 46/ER 19/RR 19
---
The line that runs through the middle of the condition bar is 'extra' durability.
---
This could be added via repairing using the perk relevant to the item or they could drop like this - more likely the higher the luck.
---
Until that bar has been 'depleted' and the armor/weapon has degraded at least a small amount of its 'normal' condition the game will not let you repair it.
---
Yeah dmg to players have been limited to prevent one shot kills. 
---
That‚Äôs a lot of civil war era top hats.
---
I was just about to help answer your problem but then I see your user flair.
---
Well, people can't see which mods you use anyway in both cases. That's why I proposed an option which is much more like what you asked for.
---
This. I‚Äôve only seen maybe five of them, and I hate that they only last for a few minutes at best. 
---
I'm close to 700hrs in game and seen less than 10. 
---
I plan to
---
I was in a duo team with a pinhead and told him to leave the two people in the silo to their run. He wanted to launch his first nuke. So he figures if he shows up to their silo and runs to meet up with them they‚Äôll let him do the launch. Needless to say they killed him while he was trying to use the view finder. He repawns and comes to my base. And they show up and start smashing up the place.   
---
It‚Äôs not cool. Worst part was I‚Äôve ran SBQ fights with the couple that were in the silo. 
---
Are you on PC?
---
Ah alas no, I'm on XB
---
Thank you, but be aware of my edit stating that a single safe probably isn't worth your time for the reasons I mentioned. Keep your hair on your head, my friend! ;)
---
Just use the points you get in game lol
---
I been on the receiving end of this too.. really not good. Griefed him relentlessly all across the nuke zone until he had to switch server's.. I wouldn't have minded if he'd actually offered some assistance in the silo!. 
---
same here, and i‚Äôve never seen them last longer than 15 seconds
---
Ahh, I see thanks. Seems like a bug if the Pipboy indicates it needs to be repaired, had me avoiding anything remotely challenging for fear my armour would break mid-quest.
---
Thanks! Definitely not very intuitive to me, thought maybe that was it, but the Pip Boy CND shows almost broken.
---
it's not so bad if you have 4 or 5 locations to hit per day. 
---
I‚Äôd like to see more weather effects, but at launch the nights were really dark‚Äîway too dark‚Äîyou couldn‚Äôt see to even find your loot. It was cool and creepy, but got obnoxious really fast. 
---
So every single melee weapon no longer one hits players? üò±
---
Not just bald, it also magically shaves you if you have any facial hair.  I was kind of hoping I'd end up getting the Field Jacket because the Leather Coat variants just show so much freaking neck.
---
This is why I don't team up with random's. Which is sad, but at least you're already aware if your friends are asshat's or not and plan accordingly üòÇüòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt want to hate on people for playing how they want but the whole serving hopping nonsense is a cancer and cheapens the experience imo.
---
How do you put a keycard in and not go to the keypad that is legit inches away?
---
Pleasant valley cabins near the 'arena' there are a bunch of plans that can spawn in the 'shops' there.
---
&gt;no games that have a dynamic world like fallout that are online that I‚Äôve ever played.
---
\- DayZ may be somewhat comparable but it's very different because it's a zombie game and a "KOS game" (which can make gameplay seem repetitive and/or tedious). Plus...when you really get down to it, it's just a zombie, open-world, free-for-all deathmatch game.
---
\- RUST may be comparable as it's an open-world, base-building game but very different from F76 because its playerbase tends to fall into the same play-type listed above so has the same issues.
---
\- Borderlands series...shares some game-play features with F76: co-op with optional PvP, *looks* post-apocalyptic even though it's on some other planet, and has quests. But the world is not dynamic and it's actually just a shoot-and-loot game. It has some strong gameplay similarities to Fallout 4.
---
\- Miscreated...that game has a dynamic world, is post-apocalyptic, has base-building, and is all online. The community depends on which servers you join. Some are role-playing, some are all KoS, and some are dynamic where 50% of people role-play raiders and the other 50% RP "normal wastelanders" yet there's no rule for who joins or does what... which makes experiences with other players dynamic.    
---
I'm always on the lookout for new post-apocalyptic, open-world, multiplayer games with dynamic worlds.  Base-building is always a nice addition but not necessarily a requirement (for me).  
---
Zombie games, however, don't appeal to me and imho they fail to meet the "post-apocalyptic" criterion.
---
When you state that a game "has a dynamic world," which specific things were you referring to?
---
Yeah and I did apparently.  Or he ran out of stimpacks.
---
You don't rush because you're not expecting someone to steal something from right under your nose!. Lesson learned! üëç
---
Yeah, but now they're too bright hardly feels like night.
---
I‚Äôve played with this one before. He just doesn‚Äôt listen 
---
I meant 150 sorry wasn't saying attention when I put it in

The only way I‚Äôll listen to the radio is if they add three dog back.

Scorched earth

Horde events
---
Are all great events but I found my tse's mostly at whitesprings in a blast zone I grind a lot and my group and I launch about 5-7 nukes a day half on the queen half on whitesprings. I didn't get my take till 120 something 
---
Keep grinding you'll get it soon if you need help I sell my services but anyways good luck
---
Items will leave shop? What?!? D: Whyyyy
---
I wouldn't be playing with him again!. Definitely not a keeper üòÇ
---
Totally! I was trying to get the beret. Did the Fasnaut grind several times a day. Only got it cause another player gave it away!
---
I have the rocket car bed. So nice. A bit small as well but nice.
---
I've had this happen with other enemies.  I think it's a glitch.  If you hit them, they stop being pacifists.
---
Except for mole miners, they wear masks
---
And I don't even like shopping and watching my money.  
---
I will not continue with that ingame.  
---
I will not disstress myself over some data for some game. It is not worth it.  
---
Great suggestions guys, thanks a lot!
---
I got shot point blank today by a guy with a TSE shotgun. I had both fireproof and  adamantium skeleton maxed out and equipped. When he failed to kill me in one shot he started running but I chased him down and killed him lol.  I don't know if it was because of my perks or the guy just had a shitty build and wasn't maximizing his damage though.  Oh and I was wearing X01 power armor, which actually isn't as good as your ultracite. 
---
Lvl 70 ish here. lvl 80 Deathclaws are a joke.
---
Hey bro, don't get so tilted, it's only a game.
---
Also if that was you throwing orbital strikes at my camp, fastest ALT-F4 in the West. You're gonna have to try harder than that.
---
I too long for an Eyebot Duraframe Subject 'x' companion.
---
Or a... \*cough\*Servitron\*cough\*, for science you know? always for science.
---
If anyone ever says to me again "lets nerf melee" I'm gonna link this thread. 
---
Welcome to the game for the rest of us, meatheads :p! 
---
(I mean that in the least mean spirited way possible. I do think you guys are OP, but yall def shouldn't be glitchy. That sucks)
---
An event where players have to find holotapes with individual tracks around the map and then upload them into the station terminal. 
---
Build it sections you can slot together and i think there is a hard limit on the distance that any one blueprint can span (about 2 and a half floor tiles in one direction though adding more stuff seems to decrease this so maybe its a volume thing and not a distance thing) 
---
But somehow you can pull your whole base though the void with the transfer base thingy when you move the camp location.
---
Yea, but the difference there is if you buy either of those you're already making a conscious decision between which one you prefer.  Because Bethesda prioritized clipping issues armor sets and outfits had to be mutually exclusive, but that doesn't necessarily need to be the case with backpacks.
---
If anything it's going to be MORE common for armor sets to have a conflict with backpacks since just off the top of my head you'll have issues like the Trapper set having it's own attached one and heavy sets like Robot being super bulky back there.
---
Most *definitely* science 
---
I will buy the grounded serum but I can't get on fallout until my internet roles back over next week. My psn is ObesePigeon1
---
well I was half right! so half a point? lol
---
Mine will be sassy, have a apron, two red eyes, and I'll call her Rosie.
---
Will add rn 
---
The game has been fairly refined, and a large chunk of bugs have been squished. It's still has a lot of issues though, but it feels a bit more akin to "Bethesda usual buggy standards" than the parade of bugs at launch. Server stability is also pretty good now.
---
Hey Niko it's your cousin, let's go bowling.  
---
Hey Niko, you want to go play darts?  
---
Hey Niko, why don't you take me to play a game of pool?
---
I‚Äôm having a whole other issue with that. For some reason when I go to lay down my base after a camp move it keeps telling me something about a blocked furniture. I spent like 5 hours on Sunday trying to figure out why but I still have no joy. 
---
Putting a keycard in should lock it. And I was at the keypad when he put another card in.
---
Don't be such a lazy asshole.
---
i think they did i have heard multiple account of people being over 25000 today
---
Yes, I had this thought as well. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stretch to assume they had this in mind when they set it up. I‚Äôm really hoping there ends up being some kind of faction system for servers I feel like there is already a good foundation for it. 
---
Already had it ! I got another copy for my friend who wasn‚Äôt online atm
---
I like stopping by the top of the world resort. Usually there will be a couple cannonballs and lead weights by the mannequin "shooting range" between the big gate and the main entrance. I just collect them over time and start using the broadsider once the ammo is weighing me down
---
Then you must not hack terminals or maybe you just haven't done many silo runs. I know exactly what the OP is talking about. I did a nuke run tonight, and hacked the terminal to disable the turrets. I successfully turned them off, then was stuck in the computer screen so long that I thought my game had frozen  completely and I would have to exit.  
---
This is not a rare occurrence either. It happens almost anytime I hack terminals to turn the turrets off.
---
Thanks in advance 
---
Along with player vending
---
Here is a thought: rein in the prices so trades can be completed with the amount of caps a single toon can hold.
---
Alternatively of course keep fueling the rampant inflation and, you know, make every trade a tedious, time consuming drag.
---
Who knows, maybe the 'legendary vendor' will alleviate this and we will move on from the current 'trades only' or 'I want \*all the caps\* in Appalachia' business model
---
For me I let it start installing it jumped to 40gb, then it installed what updates I didn't have
---
Not lazy, I used to run silos all day long. I even had 14 of the 15 mainframe cores precrafted because I was expecting to have to do the whole thing. You just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I was able to launch faster because I've already launched from Charlie this week. I didn't need to use the keypad.   
---
Keycard -&gt; Targeting computer.  
---
Or just kill them. The Assaultron and sentrybots are a good source of circtbords. 
---
I doubt they will tbh, many hardcore players farmed hundreds each. By the end of the event they were just dropping any mask they didn't want (which was all of them, based on what I heard about the drop rates). 
---
Unfortunately I'm only a level 18 lol, my friend brought me over there and I occasionally sell/buy things from them
---
Yep, that is what I am talking about.
---
Wait you can craft those I have only found them in the wild
---
What do you mean mate 
---
Love the name, btw...lol. That's good for recipes, but it's usually flooded with super mutants and annoying to farm quickly. And recipes were a bit outside the scope of this post, but thank you for your reply!
---
I think it's the berets that will be worth more...I managed 3 of them, playing casually through out the week.
---
Consider it this way: in a recent interview on the Bethesda youtube channel, one of the developers explained the reason they allowed players to use existing characters in survival.  His exact words were "we wanted to see how badly people could break the game with extreme builds and legendary gear so we can fix it." 
---
Translation: nerfs are probably coming. 
---
Across multiple characters though I believe, hope I am mistaken though
---
Eh, it's kind-of the nature of this particular beast. You server hop to avoid griefers, to find queen fights (or a server with high-enough level people on it to bother launching a nuke), to find spawned cap stashes, to find a stable server, the list goes on and on and on...
---
I once killed about 5 deathclaws is 10 minutes in Fallout 76. There 6 I can think of off the top of my head that spawn in several locations.
---
I had this bug for 3 days...then curiosity got  to me, I disabled all my other active quests and it completed, immediately on my first sneak attack.
---
I'd love to see a video, I'm not quite understanding your written instructions.
---
You guys accept the Timmies rewards card?
---
They have to be losing money on that program. A free coffee every 7 purchases? 
---
Try disabling any other active quests, it's what worked for me.
---
Nope. Still nothing to do. You leave the vault, get a game over screen, and that's it.
---
If you've got any active quests other than Biv's try disabling them, worked for me.
---
I literally downloaded the game yesterday, im not missing anything.
---
Harpers ferry has a bunch of spawns for blueprints as well tho (check out this older post if you haven't already: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ae920w/plan_farming_guide/ )
---
Strange you‚Äôve sunk so many hours into the game if there‚Äôs nothing to do 
---
That's rare? If that's what I think it is (cosmetic item) I had found one right outside of fault 76 in a bus when I first started playing twoish weeks ago
---
TSE guns were patched out so they no longer drop in the game. Either two shot or explosive will drop, but not both.
---
WE WANT FACTION STUFF PLS I WILL GIVE TOU ALL THE MONEY I JUST WANT A BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL FLAG OR SOMETHING
---
Awesome thank you for tip
---
Check the clothing vendors at the Whitespring I find them there from time to time. 
---
I would be totally down with anything at all Raider related! I had an idea for something like a hanging or impaled dead body like you can find in Raider camps but the body would be the last player you killed in pvp. It would be equipped will the armour when the victim died, not lootable of course. I think it would be a neat trophy to have. 
---
And excuse me there Mr. Freestates, but I was securing the nukes for the agenda of my faction, the Enclave. Nobody ever said we were nice people.   
---
Welcome to the Apocalypse.
---
Sorry guys, I would pretend to abide by the rules but at the first sight of confederate scum I would launch an orbital strike, mirv grenades, and mow down every grey-clad bigot with an automatic bloodied explosive handmade. 
---
Good job glossing over the entire point of the thread to give advice I didn't need.
---
Yeah it's kind of stressful actually lol.  There's already so  much going on in a nuke launch, you don't need the added worry of having it derailed by the game freezing.  Mine unfroze thankfully on the most recent nuke launch, but it's a real headache. 
---
Did you get the inspiration from jug? It looks very nice :)
---
He looks so cool!
---
Agreed. Also, would be nice if not only the per item weight was shown on stacks, but the total weight. I noticed something today too. When I moved 20 bulk copper (weighing 0.25 per unit), it took up 20 weight in my stash instead of 5 weight. Why? 
---
I hope they will release an Automatron-like DLC at the end of this year. 
---
What system? I have a spare if you're on PS4 üëç
---
Sweet will add you when I jump on hopefully tonight if not tomorrow for sure thanks man 
---
Sure, but I thought it was worth mentioning for the benefit of people who may be walking right past it each day. Plus, like /u/friendlywilfred mentioned, a few buildings down is a great spot to look for plans.
---
I've scraped some move structures and replaced them with simple, compact crap because it's so damn hard to get a camp to fit anywhere besides where it was originally built.  It's also really crappy to spend hundreds of caps trying to move the camp 50 feet down the road several times just in the hopes that the camp magically likes the terrain over there.  I've pretty much resorted to building tiny squares of buildings because placement is almost guaranteed to fail with anything bigger and sprawling.  Time to build a tiny skyscraper for the 20th time because nothing larger and more interesting will fit on 99.99% of the map.  I'm pretty sure I've spent 80% of my game without a camp or with it in a single location forever all the way across the map simply because I know the instant I move it, the thing will fail to place wherever I'm at.  Then I move my camp around 5 times hoping it might like that new area.  Nope.  Guess I'll get rid of the stored building and just start over again.  Weeeee!
---
i dont know if you said this in the post, didnt read it all but all i want is the ability to completley reset my specials and perks so i can fix my mistakes i made in BETA, early release days etc. Even if theres a caps fee to do it. I dont want to do it all over 1 level up at a time to overhaul my characters traits. 
---
I don't wanna have to make a spreadsheet to figure out which specials i gotta take a point away from to put into a special i need it in in order to make my build better because right now my entire characters is basically fucked the way the perk system is right now. Its just not fun nor worth it to try and figure out which specials i need to adjust one at a time to fix my character.
---
No worries I'm holding it for you
---
ah sorry PC
---
NV
---
Just foud one yesterday and metal helmet also.
---
It's not a bug. When it needs to be repaired, in the pip boy, it will go solid black.
---
Light Yellow: Extra condition
---
Dark Yellow: Base condition
---
Black: Damaged condition
---
The coloring is a bit un-intuitive but it's working as intended.
---
The nights need to be darker like they originally were. They fiddled with the lighting and now the nights are almost like daytime and the models in the inspect screen are washed out.
---
Nevermind.. they are pretty common.. until you go looking for one! I think I got mine from a building in Helvetia.. long before the parade though üëç
---
Yeah they're it's a good trade off and a great way to raise caps. Only costs 1 Cloth to make and the 'retail' price is 150 caps, which means you make 30-40 depending on perks/Chems.
---
Bethesda replied 
---
Thanks for your suggestion I will tell the team 
---
where at?
---
How would this apply when not all players in the combined camp are in game or on different servers? 
---
I'd gold you if I were even slightly not broke.
---
Well yesterday was update day 
---
I had to look this up because the UI says nothing about how to do it.
---
No, I'm guessing LOTS of people think you're an asshole though üëç
---
Yes I got this tonight at the Cranberry Bog #1 location.  I had 5 maps and got the purple glitch in the matrix all 5 times
---
I just scrapped one moments ago.
---
If you are using any weight reduction perks or armor effects those don't apply to items in the stash. 
---
Add Supermutants to that aswell, i'd love a friendly Supermutant guarding my base
---
You should contact Bethesda support. 
---
They should really make it apply no matter the location. 
---
I'll join what's your psn?
---
Charisma affects *event* rewards by scaling the amount of caps and experience based on how high the stat is. Another way to look at it is to say that your charisma score has an effect on quantitative rewards. 
---
Charisma does not affect rewards/drops that would be measured qualitatively, like what kind of armor you get, or what legendaries your new equipment has. Charisma has no effect on drops from random kills.
---
Nvm I swear I can read 
---
Survival you are limited to 1 of each stimpack at a time. So can only stack a diluted/normal/super at once.
---
Agree that bounty should not be automatic in survival. I hate base destroyers (yes, people like you), but I agree that if my CAMP is in survival it should be open game. Still like the buy a bounty option.
---
We already killed her but I‚Äôll add you and let
---
You know next time 
---
Have a particle effects setting that can be turned off?
---
Damn I didn't look at the psn or time lol it's too early for me 
---
Haha! All good xoxo
---
Time to update that 750ti dude.
---
The BoS combat armor mods are now item rewards from the Grafton Day event. There is an open train car on the track between NAR repair yard and Watoga Station that you can server hop and gather plans for the BoS under armors as well as the marine wetsuit and armor plans. You can also get BoS plans by turning in technical data and completing BoS related events like surface to air and distant thunder. 
---
Fusion cores are everywhere once you start looking. I've got about 30 in my stash and I still grab them from generators/PA frames even though I don't need them.
---
PS4 pro :(
---
Or try launching get the game from its folder
---
No problem, that was my intention. :)

A couple of new songs added every update would be nice. 
---
Really dont get how some people think "Go find this guy! Oh, surprise, hes dead. But this audiolog he recorded in his last moments says you should go find this Guy! Oh, surprise, hes dead..." and so on and so on is good.
---
Environmental storytelling is great, Bioshock or Dark Souls do it well. But this game?  Its a disaster.
---
We did it all the time on PC right after release but less and less people kept showing up. 
---
I'm not even supposed to be here today.
---
I want them to add more recipes for drinks but I don‚Äôt want to give them a reason to keep making them a part of the challenges.
---
Testify brother!!!!!
---
Fair enough for the tips but server hopping is lame.
---
What Luck are you running? I didn't start to see regular good drops until mine was above 25 and not consistently good drops until it broke 30. Side note just because it isn't a 3* doesn't make it worthless. 
---
Hard Bargain. Yep. Figured I forgot something. But you are correct.
---
I want that tamed at my camp 
---
I think the new backpack looks super ugly, I want an option to hide it, unless outfits is going to hide it anyway. 
---
I paid ¬£40 for it at launch and clocked nearly 400 hours playtime ...ok so it's had it teething problems but it's so much better now with lots of good stuff to come for a long time in the he future  ...the only other 2 games I've logged this much time on are breath of the wild and Warcraft and Warcraft you had to pay a monthly fee for so f76 is brilliant value for money... Anybody who whines about paying ¬£15/15$ for this should not bother playing.
---
I disagree, this would be a ridiculous move considering how many people use outfits.
---
Loved BotW. I was just wondering how those teething problems are now. I mean I get that a MMO style game is something totally new for Bethesda so expected problems, and lets face it most Betheda games are pretty buggy at launch. 
---
Thanks for the input though.
---
I don't have the same amount. I start with like 600+ shots then swap&gt; swap back&gt; have 13 shots and spend then. uses a core
---
fuck....
---
Have you checked out the Wild Appalachia graphic that has all the dates on it?
---
Someone hasn‚Äôt read the schedule they released a month ago. 
---
Pro tip: we‚Äôre right on schedule.
---
They are all over the place in the Toxic Valley. I kill them all the time. 
---
Yes I know it by heart but down with all the booze related Daily challenges.
---
love the detail on your suggestions, hope they revamp the perk system as well
---
I know the schedule but fuck the booze related daily challenges. I think my wording in the post was vague.
---
Insult bot is just ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù his time until you head off to pee.  HAs your husband ever said ‚Äúhey you go on ahead Me and IB will stand guard for 30 seconds or so.  Then we will catch up. Swear! ‚Äú
---
At least you're aware. The daily challenges are not a requirement, though. We've got a new questline coming Tuesday, I believe. Patience, sir scientist lol
---
You have a nuka stash box... CONGRATULATIONS 
---
As a courtesy because I have had such a positive response, I have another location for you: Toxic Larry's Meat N' Go. The stove in the main building has a bobblehead and recipe spawn on it, another recipe spawn on a grill on the second level, and a lvl 3 safe in the outhouse slightly to the North West up the hill. Happy hunting! :)
---
Yes but don't we all want the sweet sweet Atoms?
---
yeah i noticed also the cap stash in whitespring bunker sometimes is not there. I mean the one close to the assaultron and resort exit. 
---
I'll just sacrifice a toe. UNLIMITED ATOMIC SHOP ITEMS! /s
---
(But fr, I tend to just buy however many I need lol I'm glad you go for challenges tho.)
---
That‚Äôs where my place is. Already tricky to find a server that‚Äôs not taken some days. 
---
I don't get to do most. I hardly play a few hours a week in all because I am usually down with work, but I log in most days to check out the challenges and stuff and maybe do some easy ones in an hour or so, and sometimes I redecorate my CAMP or take a few photos for Twitter.
---
Yeah buggy Bethesda but anyone who loves their games plays through this..I don't crash anywhere near as much as I used to do.. Loading seems to be a little quicker..the fasnacht event was fun and brought people together and I think Bethesda were surprised just how successful it was.. If you read the road map of what they have planned for the future of fallout 76 its looking very rosy indeed.
---
One thing I would like to see in camp is a craftable Spawn point/disc or something... You make it then place in your camp and when you fast travel you spawn on that point...I have my camp high up in the hills and spawn in mid air and end up damaging my limbs so to stop that would be great!
---
Game's lagging like crazy. Finally errored out and disconnected.
---
It blows my mind that foundations can't be attached to floors.
---
I meant that if you have a pile of 30 stimpacks you can survive any player attacks, at certain pints you cannot die, I shot someone with multiple mini nukes, they were back at 100% health by the time i could reload. Additionally, I don't usually enjoy destroying bases, and when I do its because people destroy mine or spawn camp me. But fo76 is my go to base building shooter game  (because rust isn't on console) so I do it occasionally. My main point was that survival didn't really feel like how it was advertised, considering bases are a big part of pvp.
---
Frogs are super cute, I cuddle them and read them stories üê∏ 
---
Nothing else active :(
---
Wouldn't be a proud member of the Enclave if I wasn't. It's roleplay my dude and only a videogame. Where roleplaying raiders, murders and assholes is not only allowed, but encouraged.   
---
Have fun playing your way! I'll enjoy mine.
---
Yea I could see how this would bother you. If it were me I would move my whole camp just to start over. 
---
Definitely a bug, I have it too.   
---
The description of such effects is dynamic so it's not outdated. I guess the perk effect is not applied correctly there.
---
Not very hard to play with, however.
---
You do you üëçüëç
---
I am by no means a PvP expert, but I suspect that the rapid healing by the player is from food rather than stimpacks, or some combination of. Seems illogical for someone to tank even 1 mini nuke without PA, but its the legendary armor perks... definitely get what you are saying though, and agree that their "limiting healing" fix only really affected the casual gamers.
---
Launch it from the .exe
---
Champion!
---
Gotcha. ;)
---
Good info, thanks!
---
Kerwood mine has a level 3 safe in the room to the right of the entrance. Requires a key found in the mine.
---
Which KB? tried to write a similar script but anticheat seems to be stopping it...
---
You can't say that people don't like the story just because their lazy and want the story handed to them, because the 76 story was extremely polarizing. I loved, but I completely understand why people don't like it. The method for story telling can be very bland, and repetitive, and the story itself can get dull and become repetitive in parts. What I'm saying don't discredit peoples critisisim of the game calling them just lazy. 
---
I SAS really hoping there was a mod for the revolver to shoot quick like Quick Draw McGraw. Powpowpowpowpowpowpow. Agility drain into a victim like a quad double barrel. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôm in the minority, but I like this. I for one am thrilled to spawn into nuke zone as I often am hopping trying to find one anyway. 
---
That would be nearly impossible. For example what happens to the excess in the stash if it is full and you change perks in the field. What algorithm would you trust to drop items out of your stash (or even destroy them) to bring the weight down to limit. Without that we are dealing with the unstable server issue due to "unlimited" weight exploits. 
---
I dont use PA and by the time i am loaded i am consumed by rads.. Thats why i think its frustrating. 
---
just need modify the crafting method
---
Do until 'crafted'='desired'
---
The game just loops the "craft" method until the number crafted = the desired #. Would be a couple lines of code.
---
Oh so you took the time to do the Dungeon to lunch a nuke and kill the queen ? here, take this one star piece of crap
---
But how do I get the plans to make the magic hat of income
---
Hey I was there. That was a romp, and it completely took me by surprise. I went over there wondering what everyone was doing, and stumbled upon it. 
---
It also has a chainsaw for people that want to collect a rare weapon, even if it‚Äôs mostly just a novelty.
---
yeah I noticed it's getting worse and worse. I realized it when people was always jumping in front of me, i thought they were drunk
---
lol
---
Traveling_chef will remember that.
---
The max discount is 25%.
---
I got jist about everything bos including under armors and stuff like that so for the combat armor mod grafton day is a confirmed drop chance?
---
Sadly I am not, I play on PC. Thank you so much though for offering! 
---
I can recommend going into your machine bios and overclocking your machine. Did this the other day and it helped a lot. The game is very cpu intensive. 
---
Lvl of said item?
---
What rarity? (How many stars)
---
And is all heavy armor?
---
Are you running any mods? A few patches ago the textures for T60 armour went away and I was bright pink.
---
Even in 3 and New Vegas, Deathclaws typically ended up being a joke (except for Rawr and that one that ambushes you in Lonesome Road). In 3, the dart gun basically turned Deathclaws into the laughing stock of the wasteland. In New Vegas, there were a hundred different ways to end a Deathclaw without any trouble. Outside of a few notable exceptions, they pretty much always stop being a threat by mid-game.
---
My idea to solve the caps are worthless issue is to bring in gambling for items.
---
Every mmo worth its salt has it.
---
Simple: 2k for a handmade. Random stats and affixes (from defined ranges) caps would have value to end game in one update.
---
I've got an AA one as well, I recently found plans for it, so when I have extra scrap, I've been making one (with Super Duper on) and scrapping them, hoping for a couple mods...but I dunno how many there are. Since finding the plans I've unlocked the long barrel(It's stupid long,, like a cannon almost)...and I already had almost every scope for it. both recon, reflex sight and a short and long scope...and it might even have NV? I'm not sure...
---
Can you link to yt that shows how to build walls without foundation?
---
This was cool.  Been waiting for stuff like this.  
---
so, does that mean ghoul slayer will heal them even more?
---
Nice find!
---
I got you. Got one in my stash
---
Hopefully you chef on with more recipes, noble chef! lol
---
Why thank you! :)
---
You sure are ‚Äòdown‚Äô an awful lot, I‚Äôm alway way way up high after all this booze I have to drink üç∑ü§™
---
That's the plan! ^punintended. I actually have most of the recipes in the game so far, just trying to grind it out.
---
This and somehow I got in the near from "uranium fever" "this location will be used for feature updates" why then can I place my camp there?!
---
And "I've looked through your inventory and found nothing of interest, you may close the trade window once you're satisfied as well".
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
It wasn't specifically included with roadmap image they made, but it was included with player vending and the new camera system in a paragraph below it, and the release is April 9th and April 16th on the roadmap (probably the 9th, but nothing solid on that).
---
**New Features: C.A.M.P. Decorating, Player Vending, Functional Camera ‚Äì Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P. Build vending machines and flag items for sale. Simply set your prices and walk away to continue your adventures in Appalachia, being sure to capture all your favorite memories using the new functional camera. The vending machines do all the work, you just need to count the caps.**
---
I did this quest yesterday, it worked without problem for me (PC)
---
This is great info thanks
---
Do you do a lap of all your favorite places, and then serverhop and do it again, or do you pick a location and run all the points in it and then Serverhop? 
---
Do you know when random encounters respawn, I had assumed it was 24 hours but saw different things at one today when I visited 
---
The thirteen shots are the same amount as your cores but you don't lose anything except the shots that you fire
---
Don't log off in whitesprings
---
I believe Bethesda did mention that they are previewing items that will be discounted in the near future on their launcher, if I recall? Of course, the console versions do not include a luncher, so we're in the dark a little...
---
Thats not the point. Its the fact you cant fast travel  into a nuke zone but you can log into one. It doesnt makes sense
---
A simple system would be to drop legendary items if the stash becomes over limit due to junk storage, highest value 3* first until the wood legs and rolling pins are shat in oblivion.
---
We would all become more careful with storing endless junk.
---
+karma thank you. 
---
I'm legit outraged that the handmade does not have any available skins. This was the gun that made it all possible, I don't recall any other weapons from F4 that could be customised. I desperately want the Pack skin, but I'd settle for the Slicked Oil (Metal Armour) paint for the Handmade. I need something colourful and ridiculous!
---
Although the content has not improved much the stability has improved a great deal.
---
nice thank you
---
exactly, just combine the two, job done  
---
PA is for mid level PvE. Its crap compared to even a mediocre legendary armor setup.
---
Welcome to bethesda, on PC it's backwards too, and it's the same with the elder scrolls series, interact and jump are always switched for some reason
---
I dunno what kinda tv you have or what mode you put your tv in when you play, but my 4K tv on PS4 in HDR mode makes night time so dark sometimes I can‚Äôt even see anything without my pip boy flashlight on. If they make it any darker I won‚Äôt be able to see where I‚Äôm walking. 
---
And where would it drop these items, simply destroyed? And your cool with loosing half an inventory because your weapons weight reduction armor broke? 
---
Two small things about the deathclaw tea 1. How tf do you morph into deathclaw and where does ur armour go 2. Deathclaws aren't the most liked creatures in the wasteland where does the +15 charisma come from? 
---
I remember when I got annoyed with the endgame search for legendaries about oh 4 months ago. People on this very sub said the same thing. Still saying it now. Not gonna change im afraid. 
---
This seems to be correct. I run a bloodied/vats crit/sneak build and do well over 1000 damage per shot and it always takes me at least 3 shots (even to the head) to take down anyone with near full health.
---
Wait sorry I read it wrong the charisma is lost but if you have less than 15 of the neg stats what happens do you have to pay vendors for them to take ur stuff?
---
They could be dropped into the map but just peeking above the surface üòà
---
Both I and one of my close irl friends have both received a BoS combat armor plan from Grafton Day. The underarmor mods be obtained through the Distant Thunder and Surface to Air events. 
---
I would love to have an actual city in FO76. It would at least justify the huge numbers of enemies you come across constantly in the game. 
---
Harpers Ferry gets close to it but is too small and compact to get the right feel. Particularly when the vendor is out in the open and you have to kill 20 super mutants to check if the vendor has what you want. 
---
I really miss the eerie empty feeling of wandering the wastes then coming across a city with Supermutants and Centaurs, Enclave with Deathclaws, and all sorts of other nasty business right around the corner. 
---
At the moment every location seems equally saturated with enemies. You‚Äôre walking randomly in the woods? 10 feral dogs. Find the crazy cat lady‚Äôs house? 10 scorched in the garage. Discover an electrical substation? 10 robots. 
---
It takes a lot of the joy out of exploring knowing that any semi-major location is going to have 5-10 enemies you have to slog through to explore. It‚Äôd be nice to see a better balance in enemy populations. 
---
preach it brother
---
Did about 3 runs myself (didnt have much time to jump on) and got the giant mask and the beret and banners from a single run and nothing from the others... when I have time I too will seek an owl mask.
---
If you're on xbox everytime you go on lfg post you'll almost always see someone posting how x is a scammer.  I like to think those are the pvpers but I know very well that even some pvpers are nice.
---
In the out-building with the armor station, right? I have seen it spawn there.
---
Definitely. After 151 levels on my main character, I started a new one to do it all over again with a different build. 
---
 Saying your gun is tse hints at the problem. Two shot explosive and explosive in general got nerfed hard. The newest flavor of pvp "meta" build seems to be bloodied, with serendipity giving you essentially a coin toss to avoid damage. I see the biggest balance patch being nerfing serendipity to not work in pvp.
---
Much appreciated!
---
Yeah this was my first encounter to one lol. Judging from the clip I saved it seems that they were just camping in the enclave bunker trying to scam lots of people because when I was looking for technical data all I could see is the trade emote coming from them.
---
Luckily I only lost 2750 caps, I know most people that have been scammed have lost way more than that but it still kind of sucks that that's 2 days of vendor runs whereas for them it's just 30s trading with someone.
---
I do one at a time, otherwise you will burn up a lot of caps fast-traveling.
---
Random encounters respawn with every server hop. You can farm them indefinitely without time limit.
---
Hope I helped!
---
Nice. Im thinking a sniper build for my first time. Its my prefered fallout build.
---
It's no different than the quests that give you legendary items IMHO 
---
It's supposed to be a bonus for the harder parts of it
---
Sounds like corporate America to me.
---
Yeah and two chances for rare helmets like the medical and welder 
---
For me it was charisma check. Had to drink old oak something and buy an item from a vendor. Did that three times with different vendors and the quest did not update. However after a server hop for rabbits, the booze was changed to whiskey and my quest worked flawlessly. Did not get the wascally wabbits thouhgh.
---
Lol
---
The nights are still dark enough in certain areas, they needed a boost in light, I've been playing since the beta and the night lighting was dreadful on xbox, and I'm extremely happy they sorted that out. It suits many more people now, there's no need to change it again. 
---
The US-13C Bivouac by West Tek is a great spot for farming bobbleheads, HalluciGen canisters and mini nukes; there're four or five spawn points inside the tents.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs propped up on some cinderblocks across from the cages.
---
Tricote!
---
It's a reward for taking the risks involved with Survival?
---
Yeah I've had this happen a couple of times but like people say best not to quit in whitesprings or temp put on a radiation suit before you do
---
Ive horded loads and want to sell them really cheap when player vendors arrive 
---
The part that doesn't make sense is you die before you can even move
---
Can't forget the Queen goes hand-in-hand with a whole other can of worms that is events in this game. Rather the lack of events worth doing. Why take my chances at the few end-game events that award appropriately leveled-legendaries when I can go beat-up a buncha ghouls at a golf club?
---
Sorry I missed this but have taken your advice on the tech data, looked it up and people have said it's based off how much you loot, the more you take from containers the faster it spawns, haven't proven it though but maybe true
---
Thats what i mean 
---
How nice. I still won't buy that stupid scam you call "game".
---
Have you shipped out the 5$ canvasbags yet to the people you ripped off?
---
I'd like it if they were much harder to compensate for the extra loot. Some a laughably easy, and some are like tanks. 
---
..but you do realize as soon as he feels stronger than you he'll try and kill you. It's classic master/apprentice dynamic :)
---
By strecth ,a shotgun does it 8 times faster ?
---
This, my friend. Is what random is. It does not mean evenly distributed. A common fallacy. Besides, only fluxes spoil right? Hoard the others.
---
Killed a 2* legendary yesterday and got a syringer. I was a sad wasteland newblet. 
---
I found a dead one and when I went to scavenge its title was vendor deathclaw.
---
I was very upset I didn't get to see what it sells
---
I think it should be marked as "Suggestion"
---
Sorry. Fairly new to Reddit. I hit suggestion but first time I ever posted in this way and not just a comment. 
---
Hey dude, what times are you two usually on?
---
I‚Äôd like to!
---
Is it just me or has the chances of getting a 3 star drop of a 3 star increased in these past few days? I've been absolutely killing it at West tec.
---
Mayhaps... but I wont give him a stimpak when hes on the ground again.
---
Yep free juice from Nanny. . Ideally I'd like a couple of toys from Nanny.  I need those screws. We all do!
---
Yay!  They change it after 300-odd years!  See, the Army is modernising!
---
Tell that to the Sons of Dean and the vast amount of magazines I picked up in the same spawn spot in server hopping loop xDDDD
---
simple risk/reward. we don't all get medals just for participating.
---
It should be a random global event where it's almost pit h black and stronger enemies spawn in.
---
*its a dark night in appalachia.....*
---
Could be the text you see when it occurs
---
I find the idea of the Enclave sticking up for fair trade to be quite an enormous misunderstanding of what the Enclave is.
---
Yeah there is a chrome and a gold skin that was datamined from a previous update but who knows when they will put it in the game.
---
Exactly, just nuke whitesprings and farm for an hour, it'll grant mono perk legendaries but better anyway, even a simple bloodied is better than any trash tier
---
Robot companions are coming.
---
Every bit of direction helps!
---
 Killing other people for fun in a game designed for that purpose make an asshole it does not. 
---
Ugh...I know. But at present our practical alternatives are sorely limited. :(
---
The simplest would be to give us the choice to make the bag visible or not
---
..not scamming, good business :)
---
Drug dealers in my neighborhood use this tactic all the time.
---
Hey, I've done significantly more Tech Data hunting since then, and here is what I have found (The advice you have been given is the opposite of 
---
 what I have found :) )  - 
---
I'll use the Enclave bunker as the example, but it holds true for all of the containers you can find tech data. 
---
There is 26 Desks in the room that can spawn tech data, (plus 1 in the detention room next to it)
---
When you load into the server the loot in each of these desks has a chance to be either tech data, ordinary loot or empty.  Once you have looted the desk of anything it will not respawn loot again for about 72 hours (I've been unable to find exactly how long, there seems to be some rng on the time).
---
So to maximize your chances, look at each of the desks, if there is technical data then grab it, if there is anything else, leave it, the next time you load into the server the loot changes with a chance of Tech Data.
---
Personally I have a check sheet of the desks, and mark them off once I have secured techdata from it.  Once it gets down to the last few desks I tend to give up as the chances for techdata per desk is pretty low. 
---
Its not known for sure if handing in multiple pieces increases your chances of Good loot, my experience is that it does not, 1 piece has much chance of getting piece of apparel (about 20%) or BOS paint (about 5%) as handing multiple. (You do however get more XP and Caps the more you hand in, up to 3, after that it caps out).
---
If you don't mind server hopping, you can a lot of tech data very quickly, once every 3 days relatively easy. 
---
Another place that has a lot of containers is AMC in Watoga, roughly the same as Enclave bunker, significantly more of a ball ache to do (2 loading screens and a shit ton of turrets)
---
Places with fewer containers - 
---
Robco Research Facility, VTU and Sugar Grove. 
---
Hope this helps, and happy to discuss with anyone who thinks this is wrong, I'd be delighted to find out if there is a better method. 
---
Been playing since the beta and literal months went by before I noticed the "y:search" (im on xbox) option. None of my friends did either until I noticed and pointed it out to them. And we'd all been running pharma farmer and canned good.
---
Think I figured out how to post with the suggestion tag. So reposted. Thanks
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they removed the Deliverer aka PMM from Fallout 4. There‚Äôs already hardly any pistols in these games and they removed one? I know it was unique in Fallout 4 but China adopted the PMM as the Type 59 for the People‚Äôs Liberation Army and China is one of the main aggressors in Fallout 76 lore and Fallout in general. It would have made perfect sense to have it spawn or drop plans randomly in the bunker under Mama Dolce‚Äôs or maybe have a hidden hacked Chinese vendorbot somewhere that sold them. Maybe even have it be a unique, cute little Liberator that spouts communist propaganda.
---
Feels like a missed opportunity, to be honest. 
---
Ah perhaps they meant to refresh them after searched, but thankyou that's very helpful, will have to refuse the tempting unrusted cans in future! I am glad to have learned from the master haha will definetly take more care
---
I'm amazed that doing the same thing over and over again holds anyone's interest.  Personally I find people to help with stuff, I am trying to nuke the entire map piece by piece, and I've created new characters to try all the different weapon / armor play styles that my main isn't suited for.  Is being a junkie any good? No! how do I know?  I tried!  etc.  You're not limited by being spoon fed quests but by your imagination :)
---
I have one for you as well, if you‚Äôre still interested I‚Äôm on PC
---
I got a card if you do
---
Kikockk
---
So let me get this straight.... player trading is a mortal sin now? People to need to grow up, it's a video game. I havent duped but even if I had it's like stabbed these people's fucking mom or something. Duping is way rare these days and they got rid of a great deal of the dupes.
---
No, never experienced anything like that and I hope I never do.
---
Bro, we get it... you are the best fallout player of all time. I wasnt saying that it was impossoble to make quick work of them but they were at least 10x more challenging than in thisngame where you can easily kill them by lvl 10. In those games if you tried to face deathclaws at a low lvl it was curtains for you.
---
I've come across protectrons on robobrain treads a few times over the past few months, yes. Most often near the miner monument south of the whitespring and in the ash heap. Multiple people have been getting notifications of sheepsquatches but then not actually seeing any, but that hasn't happened for me so far. 
---
Yeah there's been protectrons on treads since day one, I don't think they're appearance is a bug (although it being called a gutsy definitely is lol).
---
The sheempsquantch attack has been a thing since the start of wild Appalachia too as well. Usually it just spawns some ghoulies or something.
---
When Aprils update arrives all vendor factions will have a bot at Whitesprings to cut back on fast travel. Also they will pool all vendor caps together so you no longer have to sell/trade with multiple vendors to aquire caps
---
Someone was saying the other day that in PVP there really isn't a difference in lower level and higher level resistance. It's more about the legendary effects that you need. So getting a level 35 assassin/sentinel as opposed to lvl 50 is just as good. Which then means we all should be doing lower level events that spawn legendary creatures instead of the higher level ones too.
---
Harper's ferry usually has pretty good chance for legendary enemies as well. And there is usually a plan spawn inside the church on the left side as you are walking in
---
I can make them. That and the BoS paint to go with it. 
---
Seriously just hopped on my weapons mule and all machetes, death claw gauntlets and mole miner gauntlets that were in my stash have reverted to non legendary minimum level 
---
It seems like the *Chameleon* effect somehow interferes with the quest properly detecting sneak hits.
---
Maybe it was just a big coincidence, but after trying all kinds of different fixes, I hopped into my PA (thus disabling any legendary armor effects) and - lo and behold - it worked, first try.
---
I'm certainly looking forward to that! My character has a decent charisma and hard bargain. It's been frustrating having such hard limits on what I can sell. 
---
Darker Nights LV 0 was the only way i could play fo4 ‚Äòfor immmersssion‚Äô so, backed
---
Combat one was in shed behing generals steakhouse.Have been there like 1k times but this was first.It was on right shell. 
---
I cannot wait. I have magazines and bobbleheads i want to display and cannoy play survival for the fear of losing them(i cannot stash them,they are over 100 poundsworth).
---
I'm not in exactly the same boat as yourself, since I'm a stealth sniper (I don't really use crits that much and V.A.T.S. only at very close range) but we might have some common ground!
---
I use a combination of leather and combat armour. Actually, it's not the most important thing because if I get into a brawl things have gone very wrong! heavy leather limbs with Stabilised mods on both arms and Sleek mods on both legs allow for relatively quick movement in Sneak and absolute zero wobble when looking down scope (no need to hold breath!) Heavy, Sturdy Combat or Marine chest piece - I've used Vanguard mostly, but that's more down to luck in what I get rather than what I'd like :) I also try and have at least one piece of Chameleon if possible.
---
Shielded raider underarmour gives, I \_think\_ +3 Agility, +2 Perception, +1 Luck? Road Leathers look pretty good with the leather armour too :)
---
For weapons, I don't really have any legendaries yet. I have a 3 star Gauss Rifle (some crazy bonuses to V.A.T.S.) but I really mostly use my Brotherhood Recon Rifle. At a distance, with headshots, it will drop most enemies in two or three shots and at very close range it will one-shot nearly everything (I use V.A.T.S. as the scope isn't practical at that range)
---
To get the right damage - Rifleman 3, Expert Rifleman 3, Master Rifleman 3, Tank Killer 3, Concentrated Fire 3, Sneak 3, Covert Operative 3.
---
Might not be much use to you! If you're on PS4 I can certainly make you some heavy leather gear and a Recon Rifle. Good hunting anyways! ;)
---
I've noticed some "shared" perks being applied when nobody in your team has them.  
---
I've had the red outline of the PA his when I'm in regular armour and the berry mentat glow when I'm not even in a team, just somebody nearby is using them.
---
you can add me nnaatteedd
---
And higher legendary spawns, got one the other day that me and my friend pulled around 30 legendary drops in 45 minutes before it shut down
---
At the beginning that happened to me, months ago. I stashed away legendary lvl 50 miner gauntlet to wait for my character get lvl 50. When the time came to retrieve one of my first legendaries and put it on use.. there was only shittyshi* waiting for me. 
---
No they aren't
---
That sounds terrifying in a game where there are zero chances of recovering anything that has gone awry in one way or another.
---
Wait so my base won‚Äôt take damage in survival??! That‚Äôs the only reason I haven‚Äôt played with my main character! Can someone please clarify?
---
And all the ventilators in the area would have an use. Just like powering up poseidon. If someone activates it, you will still need a gas mask, but you will see better.
---
I have disposable income and would happily buy items with real money if the prices were realistic and the ability to earn atoms was easier. 
---
There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm paying the price of a full game to get a couple paint jobs and a four poster bed... that‚Äôs just absurd. 
---
&gt; Multiple people have been getting notifications of sheepsquatches but then not actually seeing any
---
That's pretty much how cryptids work in the real world, too.
---
Chears dude, yeah I typically start in sneak but providing my crit meter is built I usually don't have much issue in a straight up fight.
---
Currently I'm using a two shot lever action rifle (lucky drop from a random goul today). I want to make the transition to guass as I think the damage is higher but I've only just hit lv 50 so will likely be a while before I can cobble together all the science perk cards for it.
---
It's the underarmour I'm unsure about, never bothered with it on my other characters (first was a messy rifle melee who ill delete soon and second is a heavy gunner who I love). So where, what and how to get and upgrade it would be hugely helpful.
---
Unfortunately I'm on xbox but thanks for the offer! 
---
I WANT SNOW IN THE SKY RESORT! I'm a simple man, with simple needs
---
Oof
---
No, nobody has ever noticed this or posted to reddit about it.
---
Try removing the floors and walls outside and around that wall. The game has to recognize the outside as "outside". In your case it's "inside".
---
You can also try this(not working 100%): place the wall, replace it with the door frame model without storing it, then place another wall of same material in the same spot. If done correctly it should place a wall opposite of that with the door frame. Then delete the door frame one.
---
I actually don't want this, as in the long run, pre-war money is much harder to come by then caps. 
---
You probably disagree, but when everyone start picking the world clean of it, there isn't much left. 
---
Make sure you get the Pharma Farma perk to level 3 asap, make sure you loot and search all med boxes, search is different than looting and not as obvious. You can also buy the stimpack recipe from the whitespring bunker after starting the bunker buster quest and make you own stimpacks with tick blood. But start with above perk. 
---
Not exactly a super efficient farm. But i always hit the emergency services building in watoga when I'm collecting all my vendor caps. lvl 3 safe on the left as you walk in, a bunch of chems all over the place, usually a legendary enemy, and a PA mod on the roof.
---
I come to you again with another easy safe. I have been working diligently through the night in thanks for all the positive response! Transmission station 1AT-U03, On the ground under a console. This one seems to spawn lower-level plans, but can still be useful. After about 8 attempts, I found this:

Happy hunting!
---
stop
---
I think there would be a problem with that. People can enter the silo and just do nothing and block it for everyone else. Still there should be a system in place that allowes only one player or team to launch the nuke for a limited time. It shouldn't allow people to just wait at a silo until others come, to be the one that can launch and also people that clear out everything but right before launching go afk for some reason, should lose that privilige of launching first.   
---
I've done 99% of the quests solo and launching a nuke is something i want to try solo too. Starting a pvp fight doesn't gurantee me a win, especially solo. There must only come a level 100 player with some good legendary items and he would win the pvp fight. 
---
Bethesda community manager boosting sales :P
---
On a serious note, all my friends and family are PS4 with me a lone XBox user which is a shame as  I wouldn't mind buying them a copy to have people to group with.
---
I don't understand why every game released for multiple platforms isn't developed to allow cross platform by default TBH. 
---
Idk how you roll but I‚Äôve found that sneak, 1shotting legendaries is pretty much a guaranteed shit drop  but if you let their health refill you get the good stuff
---
I still don't understand how Ripper and Chainsaw is locked way behind level cap yet obviously outclassed shit-on-sticks get LVL 45, 50 versions and keep appearing in lategame.
---
I'm quite sure there's "You will use everything and like them equally" logic in this, just like the perk system designs.
---
I killed a 3 star legendary glowing mongrel yesterday and I got mongrel meat.

That's all, no legendary stuff.

I think in an interview devs said that might already be coming

Yeah about that last idea they did. But they said it might just be an idea for ever

Would be cool tho

But not so cool at the same time tho

Yere

Agreed and upvoted, constantly swapping out perk cards is sooooo tedious and doesn't make sense IMO

Ha ha! I wish i knew what that means!üôÉ

Ya and some storms should be worse than others to the point where you need to seek shelter for 8- 13 minutes unless you have the right perks or gear. This would promote looting and just be more "survivalish". 
---
Nights should be darker on the Eastern side of the map. I stay in the mire and at night it wouldn't be actually a somewhat scary place to be if it was darker. The noise is in stuff that Bethesda has added are a very nice touch though. Maybe just turn the brightness up 15% when you are in build mode.

---
Those songs need to be licensed.
---
The license givers need to be paid royalty fees. 
---
But the game has already been paid for by you, inlcuing the royalties for the original songs.
---
So where would the money for future songs come from? From Bethesdas profits.
---
Likelihood of new songs free in the game: 0,5876% (estimated)

Basically that's what it's called when you slam two words together into a new word.

Also, don't scrap Digested Goo while "Scrapping all", thanks.

Thats why I only bulk aluminum and lead. Then immediately put it in my stash lol
---
Though so but was not sure. Thankyou for teaching me a new word
---
I mean, while that‚Äôs not a bad idea it‚Äôs not difficult to just check your stash manually 
---
I suppose it really comes down to whether or not you like blue or white better
---
Said this before, but I'm 99% sure this is how they intended the star system to work. Seems to just be a very prevalent bug.
---
Good combination of beneficial things in one place! Thanks for the suggestion!
---
The confusing thing is that if you (on PC) spam E and Return/Enter fast enough every now and again a quantity slider reading 99999 will appear. It goes away almost immediately and you can't actually move it, as far as I can tell, but the option is clearly still in the engine. Seeing that annoys me everytime I boil dozens of dirty water...

Something something ‚Äúserver stability‚Äù

Sweet, mine is themiskats, i can trade them in about 2 hours if you are available, otherwise later today

Agreed. I just started buying every plan for the same reason

I hope you didn‚Äôt pay 60 for it, I paid 40 for my copy and don‚Äôt regret it, I got over 100 hours on it, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt feel the same if I paid 60
---
I paid 37 NZD including shipping.
---
What theory?
---
That‚Äôs a pretty good deal 
---
Knitting, yes. I had the spelling error in my gamertag a few month and i was so ashamed i paid another 10 $ cad to fix it.
---
Yeah, best price I saw.
---
I think it‚Äôs just for x01
---
God I would love this. Unfortunately they will probably mention server stability as a cop out :(

Killed a 3\* at West Tek, got a Syringer.

Killed a 3\* at Whitespring, got a Drill.

Killed a 3\* at Harpers Ferry, got a Fuse.
---
The RNG in this game and the ineptitude of the devs to fix the damned loot tables is extremely absurd.
---
Absolutely. I've gone to lode baring several times to collect ore, just to find out I only have a minute before the tunnel collapses 
---
I can't prove it, but I have a hunch.
---
My idea is that Energy Weapons do have AP... for ballistic weapons. Basically, the AP cuts down on ballistic DR. That just doesn't matter when you're concerned about energy resistance.
---
I found some time to fiddle with this game. I think I solved, this is what I did:
---
\- Deleted Fallout76 folder from Documents/My Games
---
\- Updated BIOS to latest version
---
\- Updated display drivers to Adrenalin 19.3.3 with a clean install.
---
It looks like the crashes are gone and I can finally enjoy the game.
---
The issue is that I can run around and make 1400-1800 (grahm, vendor bot have separate pools) caps just selling to vendors everyday. So if I go and buy a 40j cap item I am really saying that I would rather pay you 28 days of my gaming rather than try to grind out that particular legendary. I think that is pretty fair considering how rare it would be to actually get the legendary as a drop. So how are prices inflated? They are only what they are because of how many we can easily earn in the game. 
---
The X-01 was a special exception as it was never field tested. Bombs dropped before it was finished. That's why we barely see any on the west coast.
---
Bud. Greater risk means we get greater rewards, there was nothing easy about last weeks challenge 
---
Is that used in a crafting recipe? 
---
Maybe have an option to hide them?
---
Yea because its bloodied.
---
&gt; Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.
---
I'm sorry, each i see someone use the word hope i think of the Architect.
---
2 months later and I also has this issue. Its even so bad that i can't even see past the intro of the game as i bought it yesterday. I have done everything on me end and nothing has worked. The devs don't even reply to my thread, its even worse they just ignore me or delete my topic. THIS IS NOT A USER END PROBLEM, FIX YOUR """DAM servers Bethesda. How can you even allow people to still buy this piece of \*\*\*
---
I guess there isn't.
---
But I am following anyway
---
I have encountered this problem with other horde events too.
---
For instance the robobrain horde in the Cranberry Bog. If the "alpha" spawns in an interior cell it will spell trouble.
---
If is RobCo there is a strong chance that a) there will be mobs inside from a different faction, for instance Super Mutants, and they will aggro and potentially kill it if one is not swift and b) it will spawn in the basement inside the collision next to the toilets.
---
If is the AMS building in Watoga in all likelihood the turrets will shred it before having a chance to get to it.
---
Got DCed once in WS and when I relogged it was a nuke zone. That's why I have the Hazmat Suit on my favorite wheel, really helps.
---
Between the duping ban and swiping launches from people you seem pretty lazy tbh.
---
Fair, it's about time we datamine and find out if it does or doesn't help lol because there is DR against energy damage, so why wouldn't it be able to pierce that armor? (Especially if explosive but the real life logic is flawed lol)
---
Just use up the emptier ones first.
---
I think it's a glitch of some kind. I've seen the vendor deathclaw a few times and it's always dead. Which shouldn't be possible because you can't kill vendors
---
Might be able to go back to those darker nights since power aromr headlamps recieved a 3x brightness increase since then. Though an option would probably need to be added for non-power armor users.
---
I am probably going to wear power armor just to get rid of these fusion cores
---
Theres a second level 3 safe down the road near the fast travel point in the house with the black powder rifle/pistol as well.
---
Bring a bunch of pumpkin grenades with you when you are going to the queen.
---
Makes her take +100% Damage for 5 seconds, and from my observations it helps a lot when the queen seems to glitch and take no damage.
---
Of course you have to get her on the ground first. When she lands cripple both wings to prevent her from taking off again. 
---
I‚Äôm a half decent musician, I‚Äôd make some songs for way cheaper than anyone else would, that Bethesda could just have. I mean, I‚Äôd want to get paid a little bit, or at least have my name on the songs. Just sayin‚Äô. I have like a home studio and everything. And am independent. 
---
Or you can always just drop them.
---
Yeah but  I might as well wear the power armor and get some harder stuff done
---
I have 5 locations spawn for horde events in Cranberry Bog. Two spawn in Watoga. If you arent lucky enough to get the leader in the first four, it is bugged and you cannot complete it.
---
I have a screen shot of it.
---
Probably had nothing to do with being explosive and more to do with being a crit headshot. Handmade kills in 2-3 body shots and usually 1 shot if a crit headshot.
---
With the right perks and luck you can basically go into every battle with a crit banked. Kill a few woodland creatures, get a crit, crit a player, restart cycle.
---
Psycho
---
Maybe...
---
That's really cool...i'm saving up to buy the neon letters too lol

---
One cap pool?
---
Legendary vendor I believe is May 23rd
---
Elex actually has that exact feature where you can get old coins to be used in vending machines 
---
Wait, do treasure maps have something valuable and worth the trouble? I have like 30 of them and never checked one...
---
Long Johns I believe. 
---
I feel like mmo‚Äôs have a pretty long history of boss/legendary fights that MIGHT yield a good drop. All rpg mmo‚Äôs are like this, destiny is like that. Maybe the issue isn‚Äôt the drops it‚Äôs that the queen is just too much effort to get to/kill or, that there should be a tier of enemies like scorch beasts that are easier to find/defeat and leave the most absolute premium drops for the queen?
---
I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, the loot system is still a mess but, it would be strange for an online game to create a loop where you‚Äôre getting guaranteed drops from enemies.
---
Roll another character so you can wear both?
---
But anything you need. Most people sell junk for caps and aid for caps. If you want to mass produce a certain aid (for me as a tank I'd want psycho buff) then buy every bit off buffout and psycho you get. Maybe you aren't a hoarder like me but this I what I'd do lol
---
I meant level
---
There's a perk (I think) where they weigh close to nothing. Or maybe it is that they last twice as long. It's been SUPER worth it for me.
---
I think you just invented the Automotron DLC update from FO4
---
I wanted the beret but I just kept getting owl masks.
---
That is just indicative of an inherent design problem: caps are easy to acquire at a predictable rate, there are not enough sinks to counteract that and desirable legendaries are exceedingly rare and impossible to acquire at a predictable rate.
---
Which is why the 'Legendary vendor' is a better approach; as long as it is implemented correctly there is another avenue to obtain legendaries.
---
If it proves successful personally I would add a cap sink to it too and allow to purchase tokens for an appropriate fee.
---
If this is still not enough to balance the economy I would look into blocking some means we are currently using to make easy caps that are borderline exploit territory.
---
Circle strafing almost feels like cheating because most games don't have AI that can handle that type of movement. Once you get behind them you can just adjust so you can stay out of harm entirely...
---
There‚Äôs  actually a perk for both, batteries included and I forget the name of the other lol.
---
I think there is an actual option for this in-game right now. But locked out for some reason (maybe server stability issues when building a lot of one item). Spam build a bunch of boiled waters and you'll see a slider at 99999 kinda showing you can build a certain amount instead of spamming. 
---
Yeah like all vendors share one cap pool.
---
In 6 days
---
I mix and match the patriot with a couple of my PAs. Patriot and BOS. Look nice mixed, especially on the T-60.
---
I'd love to have caravan back! I used to be great at that
---
 Dude, motherlode literally ends with the autominer talking to you and breaching the surface. 
---
And show us what we have same time...
---
Pay people to launch nukes for you, buy people‚Äôs unwanted legendaries to scrap them later.. I do agree they need better cap sinks exactly because of what you mentioned. It‚Äôs too easy to grind 6k+ caps a day, especially with the pooled vendor caps coming, and so not many people will sell high valued items. 
---
I am with you that I hope the legendary vendor can help. I won't be selling any legendaries to the vendor any longer. All go to the legendary vendor for tokens. We will just have to see how easy it is to turn those tokens into new effects. 
---
Alright, but during the quest there you find terminals that describe the dumping.
---
Give survival a try and tell me how easy it is....good luck. The challenge itself isnt bad this week, last weeks was painfull
---
I have loads of chems that I never use... You only have to kill a few ghouls at whitespring to farm them and if you do a lot of PvP you'll have more junk than you need... I'm always throwing it away.  
---
Bethesda should find a way to give them some kind of value...  
---
I think it‚Äôs a load test to see how the early warning notifications will work and interact with users and environment.
---
When the appropriate DLC is deployed then you‚Äôll see sheepsquatch.
---
Again just a theory 
---
So you would have 3* legendaries always drop 3* loot.
---
This would not only devalue current good to god rolled items but would ultimately increase the amount of these items in circulation.
---
So now you can just easily farm you super items, then you are done and what? Tell me what other endgame content you would do besides farming? Thats literally all there is to it in this game. Farming shit. 
---
If everyone was running around in BIS Gear whats the point if playing.
---
Kinda direction of its about the journey not the goal
---
 Only related thing I'm aware of its the holotape where a reporter is investigating a dig site and the security guard pulls a "he's got a gun!" 
---
forgot the location name, but the train yard south of the military yard that you go to for one if rose's quests for a radio part has a broken down building and a vault with a failed robbery. duffle bag, tommy gun, lvl 1, 2 &amp; 3 safes.
---
I have been getting more 2* and 3* drops since the last patch, not just at West Tec. I still get 1* drops from 3* enemies though.
---
Atoms? No. Caps? Maybe.
---
This is barely a coherent thought...
---
Oh yes, sorry ! I‚Äôm on PC !
---
Do you have the flux?
---
I concur. 
---
Who else has been getting level 40 or lower loot from maxed enemies? It started a few patches ago. Oh a 3* weapon. Level 25. 
---
Those licenses are not that expensive, the songs are 50 or 60 years old, and most of them haven't been the smash hits. But they still cost money.
---
And I mean no offense, but can you produce a song with a singer of the quality we hear in those old radios song, with an orchestra and decent background singers?
---
Bethesda can produce music on their own, they have people in house and a very talented guy on short dial. It's about the charm of those old timey tunes we wanna hear.
---
Census violence at the powerbox in watoga does this. There is also a mr messenger in the mire hills that tends to spawn waves of deathclaws, not sure if that last one is always deathclaws though.
---
Did I just find a swingers ad in a fallout subreddit?
---
Agree. The words that pop up saying you probably need a gas mask to protect yourself from mesothelioma are untrustworthy at best. I need more indication of the dangers in the wasteland please. 
---
This is true. He's been doing silo runs all day in the past
---
I have 2 violet flux, I‚Äôm missing 3 I think...
---
Lol, never played FO4 tho. Such a shame, i know
---
I also had a sheepsquach horde event too, right after wild Appalachia released. I told my friend that i was playing with when it happened and it said feral ghoul horde for him. We went and surprisingly it was feral ghouls lol

Oh yeah gotcha üëç
---
D.Va MEKA loadout might be closest to Gatling plasma, TSE shotgun, and missile launcher.
---
What you‚Äôre experiencing is a classic case of FOMO.. don‚Äôt let your anxiety about PvP get in the way of getting a legendary you want, it‚Äôs a huge map and if you‚Äôre smart you won‚Äôt ever see another player while doing the challenge. The guns aren‚Äôt even that great anyways so I think your outrage is a little misplaced.
---
There's an Insult Bot?
---
Well, that is the one reason why is being implemented so despite the many ups and downs we have experienced since the game was released I remain hopeful.
---
It won't be a 'Legendary Modification' port from FO4 though; RNG - educated guess here - will feature heavily in the mechanic, but given that as mentioned this is something that is going to be introduced primarily to alleviate an existing and acknowledge design issue I think there is reason to expect a positive outcome.
---
Yeah good idea
---
Instead of me posted a new post. When does player vending come? 
---
Oh yes I need to craft 2 calibrated shocks ! I‚Äôll try to find these 8 violet flux and I‚Äôll come back to you when I have them, then ! Thanks a lot for your help !
---
No worries!
---
Heads up griefers can‚Äôt slap damage anymore in adventure mode with pacifists enabled. Unless you engage with them in PvP.
---
All you have to do is block their GT.
---
They still can trash your camp though so if they‚Äôre intent on griefing it‚Äôs best to server hop
---
I suspect as survival mode is weeding out the whiners, they‚Äôre gonna come back to adventure mode to start crap üí© with pacifists
---
I have found 3 so far at level 22 and boy were they bothersome
---
Id argue with that, considering the fact the that the whole "everyone is dead thing" shouldn't affect this games storytelling. Bunker Buster quest again as an example. Through the use of notes and terminal entries alone, we learn the depressing story of a manhunted man stuck in a bunker with his beloved daughter, his dementia growing worse, climaxing in his daughters death. 
---
While more of a hidden gem, the Enola Walker story is an example of a quest that works really well without any npcs . I think a few questlines should be been without npcs, such as the BoS or MoM quest.

Read the in game lore.

War caused inflation meaning basic items are worth millions whereas the influence of Nuka Cola's promotion means you can buy it for some caps.
---
They won't suddenly revert that.
---
Now however, we know there's an enclave event/quest coming in that will allow one to be elected president. It would be interesting if said president was able to take "executive acts" like reverting the inflation or whatever.

But that is a change I'd rather see through in game action than just by an update

I‚Äôm utterly convinced that for the first month I played I received godly items and didn‚Äôt realize it, selling them off to vendors for stash space. I‚Äôm now being. Punished with wooden armor as a result of my hubris.

Allow me to romance rose (looks around room) FOR RESEARCH!!

I'm wondering if the huge amount of map space to the east and west (and the little bit to the south) that is currently off limits might be used at some point. Doesn't seem like there'd be anything stopping them adding locations there.
---
You can get plans for Civil War era clothes from dead reinactors. They spawn in two places. First, just south of the Overseer's Camp, there's a truck on the road. Go to the right (across a gravel pit)and you might find one in a clearing under the trees. The other spawn place is in the dried-up Summerville Lake, more-or-less opposite the Lakeside Cabins. I did a video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptu9iSeoYQ However, I have yet to find a top hat plan.
---
OMG, so much yes!
---
Mate that was ace. 
---
There is also a level 3 ground safe in the small building in front of the barricades. The one next to the armory, where the displays with the black powder weapons are. Slightly to the left if you fast travel to Harper's Ferry.
---
Got the Gauss Rifle plans out of it, and other nice things.
---
Good points, I agree with a few, but I still get invested if the story is told well, dead or alive. The whitesprings holotapes about the survivors are very intriguing, and it really brings out a story of struggle in a hostile new world.
---
I‚Äôm on pc :‚Äô) thanks though, if you were offering to trade!
---
The amount of places like that are incredible. Soooo many places that look like they were made precisely the wrong size on purpose.
---
It's infuriating.
---
Tough.
---
I vote for longer, more intense and dangerous rad storms.
---
I think most would be fine with using the extra areas, and that may be the case. The length of the new quest line and additional loot is the big thing. As I say, bridge the gap in the story line and bring some classic fallout themes in. 
---
Move your camp, then select the blue print and do 'store'
---
um, YEAH ... play it ;-)
---
25k dont let them low ball you. 
---
I spend the majority of my time at West tec so only really noticed there. I've also noticed the amount of legendaries spawning there has increased. I got 4 legendaries inside and out in one run last night and 2 of them were 3 stars. But good to see its not just west tec. Hopefully they have actually listened and increased the drop rate, because it is annoying as hell! 
---
Just found an copy for 15‚Ç¨ should i buy it?
---
Occasionally you will get plans out of them that are rare or otherwise expensive at vendors. Look on the Reddit markets some time. There are often people buying treasure maps for caps. It's a trap. Keep your maps and use them!
---
I'll have to check that out...

At one point I looked in my stash and had over 400 lbs of cloth as duct tape also yields cloth when you scrap it lol. I stopped bothering with it and kept like 100 for armor repairs
---
Very similar mechanics and graphics to Fallout 76, only with an actual quest and human NPCs. Not the best Fallout - that goes to Fallout 3 IMO - but still definitely worth buying and playing through. 
---
That does happen some time, in my experience.
---
Yeah kind of like the scrap gambling in Rust, or even just gambling mini games amongst friends. Whoever gets a higher score in Nuka Tapper wins all the caps idk.
---
Okay
---
It‚Äôs funny that the C.A.M.P. Automatically offers signs for Ammo, Armor, Weapons, etc. and we aren‚Äôt able to separate them. 
---
More so if thing go as planned an 'pacifist' extends to CAMPs.
---
I mean one can drag two or three Scorchbeasts with their cohort of Scorched and let them have their way with the CAMP in question but just extending the 'no build zone' radius seems more practical.
---
Fo76 graphics are shit tho :(

This might be an unpopular opinion but I actually loved that quest. So much that goes on in Fallout games is showing us how horrific the world of pre-bombs 2077 actually was - the rampant destructive hypercapitalism, the corrupt government, forever war, environmental destruction etc. The soul-draining frustration of that quest was, to me anyway, a really immersive example of that kind of storytelling.

I use the targeting hud in mine as all enemies glow red and are easy to pick out.  It also seems to bug sometimes and teammates get the effect too.

---
I had a 3* Super Mutant at the army base just East of West Tec this morning so it may be worth popping over there during your visits. A bloody melee player showed up outside and killed everything before I could see what was outside and I didn't bother to go inside.
---
It dropped a 1* assassins pick. 
---
Thanks for saving me from having to turn on my Xbox just to figure out the name! My mind won‚Äôt quit when I can‚Äôt think of  the name of something sometimes. 
---
It is one of the best areas of the game. Especially when you think this station just fell from the sky. 
---
I hope in a future update more is done to this area. 
---
Debuff: you slowly heal ghoul's in a radius of x meters.
---
Yeah I agree
---
I'd like to see more hits from the later fifties move into the game. The irony is that a majority of the music used in Fallout 76 is actually from the forties since all of it is pretty much public domain now
---
Bad graphics are part of Fallout's charm I think! ;) 
---
Remember, regardless of the system you are playing on, Fallout 4 has mods. There are a few that make the game look much nicer, even on console. 
---
Thats good as well
---
Mods on console?
---
My gamer tag is Pazza hut. I'm in UK and work odd hours so hopefully I'll catch you two at some point. 
---
Lol downvote all you want dude but your attitude is toxic if you wanna blame all your negative experiences in this game on PvP players. We play this game the same as everyone else but desire a little more variety in our gameplay, doesn‚Äôt make us toxic and attitudes like yours show it‚Äôs actually the other way around sometimes.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs better than what they‚Äôre asking for in the PlayStation store haha 
---
That sounds great. I now restrict myself to Civil War era arms to make the game more of a challenge. I look pretty nifty in my Confederate uniform too. I like the Union outfit, but not the backpack. It makes me tired to watch my character lug it around.
---
I think that's the point. If your character isn't very intelligent, it should be more difficult to craft the things you want
---
If you want to run a nuke zone without a hazmat suit or PA you are gonna need to be on a team.  Run rad sponge shared (at least two stars) and ghoulish.

But they cost money right?

I cannot tell you which one is better, I guess that depends on weapon/build/playstyle but I can tell you that Four Leaf Clover completes my 'Shotgunner' build in a way that no other single perk does.
---
You have a handful of mods by Bethesda, which cost, on the Creation Club. But literally hundreds of free ones made by the public. 
---
I really think this is THE IDEA for this game and Bethesda shall apply that to the game and recognize you 10% of the gain ... bro u'll become rich!
---
The rng gods are never with me haha. So lots of hopping
---
You absolutely need defensive if you want to make this build viable at all. Go for the highest health you can get and Ass/Cav.
---
I will think about it
---
Yeah, I suppose that's true 
---
You can always add me. I am in the Central Time Zone but am always up late. Gamertag is warp58.
---
It's not that hard to run nuke zones without power armor. For whitespings, just wear a hazmat suit and pop a rad-x. The ghouls in WS do mostly radiation damage so the 1k+ rad resistance will give you tons of protection, just have radaway on hand and don't get over wheeled.  I solo WS frequently in a hazmat suit.
---
For the SBQ fight, if people don't kite her out of the rad zone like they should, have Fireproof 3 to reduce her scream to no damage and maybe Blocker to mitigate the melee from other scorched adds she calls in. For SBQ you'll want stimpacks. Having First Aid and diluting some will make them last longer.
---
I also just helped an online friend get a copy of the game.  From the negative bias reviews and false news, they were not convinced of the quality of gameplay but he is loving it now and playing with the group. 
---
According to Road Map also in 6 days
---
Yeah, one of the biggest songs in the fallout franchise (I dont want to set the world on fire by the ink spots) was published in 1941. A number of other songs are also in the same category and you can tell which just by listening to the vocal recording quality. I think fallout 76 has the newest song in its collection with Country Roads, Take me Home

It really doesn't bother me and it will change soon.

If you enjoy the game then the bugs are acceptable for now, if you find yourself with‚Äùnothing to do ‚Äù then it‚Äôs probably not the game for you. That‚Äôs not a knock on you personally just a fact. I‚Äôd advise reading the roadmap of what Bethesda is releasing and if anything sounds interesting to you then play it again once those updates are released.

Just out of curiosity have you played past Fallout games?

Yes I know what the Targeting HUD does, but it doesn't have the PIP and I am colourblind so red hue is not much use.....what I am wanting to know is '**is it worth me searching for the T51b RECON SENSOR**' or does it only exist for the X01 suit?

You connect it to a power generator, and it's either on or off. If you connect a pressure plate or something else to it, you can make it so the alarm is triggered, similar to how the powered traps are triggered.

Ok I thought my buddy is talking BS but he was firing his TSE Lever right next to me and claimed it transformed into a 50cal MG right after he put it away. He was standing next to me and said ‚ÄûDude my lever just transformed into a 50cal‚Äú. I didn‚Äôt believe him but as I checked, the Lever wasn‚Äôt in his inventory anymore.

The same algorithm that drops items out of my inventory when it's over weight from perk switching.

I think Bethesda should have dedicated considerable resources and time to revamp the shooter mechanics, especially since PvP is now a huge part of the game. Like you said, they were fine before. In fact, for me, the poor shooting mechanics only reinforced the idea that Fallout was an RPG, story-driven game first, and shooter second. But now, with PvP involved, that has changed. 
---
I honestly can't see it being changed though, unfortunately. 
---
A good example was the Glass Caverns (and most of the brotherhood of steel's locations) because with all the information from holotape, battle remnants, notes, you see that these people literally fought to the last man standing at the enemies doorstep trying to stop the Scorched.
---
I don't know about rarity as ive seen alot of vendors with them. All are 2 or 3 stars and it's a matching set. I'd have to check the heavy part. Either way I bought the set together. 
---
Fallout 4
---
Rarity being what it is it‚Äôs still more than likely a dupe.

So you‚Äôre being downvoted in the same sense a CSGO aimbotter would be if they claimed the game was too easy.

Even a small amount of duped weapons massively increases the liquidity in an other wise very shallow market.

I swear once I used unyileding armor and jacked my special stats I started to get better drops. All the weapons I'm currently using except 1 was a drop.

yes, I saw it on there, but no-one can corroborate this in the game, and if the watoga vendors are supposed to sell all the T51b mods.....why is it not there?

It's a text bug.  All the defend/retake quests for workshops seems to have an occasional error in the display text that references Sheepsquatch.  If you show up it turns out to be just Mole Rats, Ghouls, Supermutants, Scorched, what ever random enemies were to spawn in the defend quests.
---
Has been going on since the first Patch 7 update.
---
This is what I want too. 
---
Would this single player mode have any quests, or just purely creative? 
---
Would you have to scavenge for building resources, or have an unlimited amount?
---
A private server, where progress carries on. You can choose a select few people, and they have access to the world regardless of if the other people are online. Some objects and buildings are lockable by individual players, so that they have the ability to not only contribute to the grand design, but also have their own individual part of the world. 
---
You can choose to have the world open to others, who can come and see your world, and also set server rules, such as whether other players have the ability to build, whether PvP damage is enabled, etc. 
---
That's just how I would like to see it!

Too much lead,stay clear of those paint cans
---
Good to know that's there, I'll definitely be poking around that. Looks like it's based purely off the weight of the piece, so (in theory) a "heavy" piece could potentially still be better for stealth than a "light" piece of a different armor type. Thanks for sharing!
---
&gt;wahhh I fucked up doing my tricky min-maxing scheme and it is ALL YOUR FAULT BETHESDA!!!! WAHHHHH!!!!!!
---
The system wasn't designed for you to constantly hot swap perks.
---
So when you say there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing to do‚Äù do you mean not enough quests or is the idea of gearing up different characters not fun for you? Personally I find it to be a fun game but I understand when people say they can‚Äôt find enough to do in it. There‚Äôs definitely a lack of end game content right now but they are releasing 4 person vault raids along with new storylines which I think will give new life to the game. 
---
What were your favorite parts about Fallout 4?
---
As a Xbox plebe I'd disagree due to noticeable performance issues already when weather kicks in.
---
As a player with poor eyesight I'd also vote no on darker nights. 
---
I'd be down with rad storms though. They don't seem to mess with performance as much and they look spooky.
---
I feel pistols need a little help yes. However once you get to a decent level a lot of  the basic mobs can be killed easily with pistol. For killing bigger stuff it won't work but I feel it shouldn't to some extent, it's a side arm. It's just frustrating when certain "trash" enemies like gulpers etc suddenly take almost no damage because the armor pen is really weird. I don't mind not being able to burst a scorchbeast down with pistol but you don't even have a viable cripple like shotguns have. (even enforcer 1 seems good). 
---
I am in now

Howabout you also stop posting?

Do you think the luck skill has any effect on how often plans spawn?

Disgusting.

Batteries included drops weight.  I think you get that around level 30. For my build, drops the weight fom 3# to 0.3#

You get the Power user (reduced consumption) perk @ L50.

Whitesprings is still the official lego farming spot. Only time worth doing the SBQ is if someone else has droppes the nuke. Sooooo many 2*'s off her and so many 1* bs off her.

---
Someone posted a detailed look at this.. can‚Äôt find it now though, the conclusion was that having both was pointless, better use critical savvy. 
---
But there are two stashed there. One on the ground by the forklift and one by the dumpster. If you‚Äôre describing both of those, then it didn‚Äôt move. 
---
So personal choice? That's not how automated things work. 
---
Absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Sounds like you didn‚Äôt even bother reading the OP.
---
That's a good honest way to put it. 3***
---
Yes, I do. It's about time to upgrade my hardware, so running on max settings is a bit taxing for the ol' rig. :)
---
Play Survival. I'm pretty sure there's only enough people playing to fill a couple servers so you won't have that issue.
---
Well, sometimes the cap stashes just don't spawn at all.  They are still a bit random, even if they can physically be moved by explosions.
---
My favourite stuff about fo4 were that you could always have something intresting to do, and if you didnt you could just download a few mods, you have intresting characters and a ok story. fo4 was boring in multible parts, but not as much as fo76.
---
What, exactly, are you talking about? Bethesda forums?
---
I just tried them and I'm not seeing any issues.
---
Every enemy should drop three star loot! That way by level five I can be decked out in all the end game gear. They should also have a button at the overseers camp that when you press it, it says "You win!" And then the game is over. That way we can skip all the middle stuff.

I want one of the massage assaultrons from Whitespring to be my CAMP guardian.

---
My only buddy I played 76 with had quit because he‚Äôs level 150 and still not found anything worth keeping. I‚Äôm still using a level 25 2* handmade and to be honest struggling to take on queens and most other end game content is difficult with a shit gun and not enough ammo. Sort of in a weird spot where I‚Äôm not interested in grinding events and same shit just for a gun but on the flip I‚Äôm bored of everything being ridiculously hard and high maintenance whilst doing such unspectacular damage. All I really wanted to do was make a heavy explosives build but the ammo, weight and lack of damage issues make that pointless/impossible. Havnt really played in a few weeks because other than grind or build a new base I dunno what to do lol. 
---
If every song were personified into individuals with stats and characteristics from their song, how would each fare in a battle royale?

Yeah, I don't stress about them, they're just cosmetic items really so it's not game-breaking to not have every single one.

I would, however, pay cold hard cash for perk card packs
---
Where did you get the Leather Coat? I always love picking up new outfits. 
---
You‚Äôre telling me man

thanks for the tip!

I gifted a copy to a friend who‚Äôs account was suspended. 
---
Now we‚Äôre running new characters through the game using different builds than before. 
---
Wahoo!  I just hit level 25 and can use the blade of bastat with the garb of mysteries and the eye of ra!
---
I‚Äôve gotten decent weapons drops but I cant get armor for the life of me.  I‚Äôve been using the same stuff for about 90 levels now... decent but not amazing stuff. 
---
I‚Äôve never had an issue with that wiki, so I‚Äôd assume it was available.  Likely a very low RNG chance, like a jet pack.
---
Mods are still random and not everything has a crafting plan.  
---
Also check Harpers Ferry.  I‚Äôll keep an eye out to see if it pops.
---
&gt;  No successful multiplayer franchise has a combat system as clunky as fallouts, because it wouldn't be popular. 
---
Erhm DayZ was far more popular and far more clunky and still is. The only thing thats feels clunky to me is the use of VATS and in my opinion this should be removed entirely from Survival, at least for Player Targeting. 
---
If everyone had to aim instead of just pressing a button and critting away it would be far more balanced.
---
That is a question I have not tested, so I honestly cannot say. I have an 11 luck build, 12 with armor buffs, and I seem to get a plan out of lvl 3 safes about one out of 8 times, but that has outliers. :)
---
Except it does make a difference. It functions exactly the way it is supposed to. They are forcing you to decide whether you WANT to spend the time swapping cards, to pick a lock on a random safe, for random rewards, then swapping cards back before you move on to your next activity. In other words, if you aren't going to be ready to pick a lock at all times, you have to decide what is a better way to spend your time, killing enemies for their loot, or picking a lock for the loot in the safe.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what it was designed for hence why you can. 
---
We just need more enemies out in the open world period. Everywhere. Of all kinds.
---
I like the flooring in the bottom half
---
So basically NPCs? At the end of the day FO4 and FO76 are fundamentally different games so I could see how you‚Äôd like one and not the other. If you have a mic then you might find other players to be just as interesting as some NPCs especially in RP communities. All comes down to personal tastes tho and I‚Äôd recommend giving it another shot once new content is released and maybe those stories will speak to you in a different way. 
---
Agreed. At this point, I would need a couple level \*\*\* 1,000 Legendary Chameleon Deathclaws in order to expend more than one magazine. Of course they would both drop \* cloaking wood armor.
---
So should i ditch the idea of bloodied/unyielding melee?
---
Treasure Digs always contain some Caps (5-25), Weapons (Legendary is a very small possibility), Armor, Junk, Ammo, &amp; Aid Items, and frequently contain Plans and/or recipes, most tend to give you a good mix of weapons that can be scrapped, but be careful many are in remote locations without a nearby workbench, and you can get encumbered quickly.
---
You can dig each location as many times as you have maps, and the Cranberry Bog &amp; Savage Divide maps yield the best plans.
---
The excavator has a natural +100 carry weight but each suit can get calibrated shocks which would give them +100 as well. So the excavator can get up to +200.
---
All suits add strength ans strength caps at i think 15
---
If you can have both I would take both. You can get crit hits every other shot with both of them
---
Is it power user?
---
That's sounds so random, it might just work. Curious to see if someone could pull it off. Might try something like it next build
---
Only the excavator suit increases carry capacity
---
Why would you need to automate it? Once it's past max nothing else can go in it. 
---
The whole point of a STASH limit is to limit the amount of items/stacks loaded into a single server at once. Being able to throw extra stacks of things into the stash with perk cards isn't going to add much more than extra food that's going to spoil in a few hours and a few extra weapons and armor.
---
Honestly, since base junk is a finite number of items stacks it would be nice to see it weigh 0 in the STASH rather than increase the limit again.
---
They could keep the drop rate the same, but only spawn enemies with the number of stars that match the loot they actually drop.  In other words, just fewer 3* enemies because it's infuriating the way it is now.  You could even make 2* legendary enemies have the capabilities of 3* legendaries if you like, hardly anyone will notice.  I can't imagine any down side to this.
---
What do you mean you aren't able to separate them?  There is a plan for the small letters that lets you spell out anything you want, instead of usuing just the signs.
---
And Ammo, Armor, and Weapons are already separate sort categories, and separate crafting benches.
---
So not sure what else you would be getting at there.
---
I have a leather chameleon left leg if you might want it. It‚Äôs level &lt;15 and I‚Äôll sell it to you for 500 caps

---
The devs did it on purpose to raise hype ;-)
---
DayZ is not a popular example of a first person shooter though, or what people would use as an example of a good first person shooter, I'm talking about the most popular series in video games that people enjoy, and Bethesda seem to be trying to make PVP more accessible in 76, but it just doesn't work because of the poor mechanics in combat. 
---
So the fact that my strength stays at 13, even in a suit, is a bug ?
---
Indubitably 
---
Sorry, I was unclear. The storage. I want to separate the storage. Everyone knows what the benches are, why label them? (Even tho the whitespring recently did).
---
Probably 
---
[Sure!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgjKgpNzcAI) 
---
Then why are you on this sub, looking at patch notes? Sounds like you've got some issues.
---
The power armor chassis (regardless of loaded power armor pieces, even with none) raises your Strength to 11, if your Strength is below 11.  If your Strength is above 11, it does nothing.
---
Motion Assist Servos can be used to add +2 Str on your Torso, which translates to +10 Carry Weight.

Upstairs is pretty much sealed off. It houses the fusion generator, along with power conduit hookups. You can get back in there if need be, by removing a roof section, then a mid-wall. Reassembly is done by replacing the roof, then replacing the mid-walls.

Nope, because your Str is above 11, the Chassis has no affect on you.  It only raises you up to 11 if you are below it.
---
So what excatly is the poor mechanic that makes f76 different from every other fallout 3D game. I dont see any xD
---
Part of what I've always loved about Fallout games is environmental story telling.  That's been the bread and butter of the series.  The NPC driven story quests have never ever been what Fallout is about, just something there to drive the overall narrative (not unlike the overseer's mission).  
---
Never understood the hate for the way story is told in 76 because it's terrific, as long as you don't just assume the overseers logs being the only story in the game.  So much more to enjoy out there.   
---
It wont be easy because they would need a contract with Spotify
---
Fo76 is made to be a multiplayer experience. Sorry. Try modding fo4 
---
There's several other locations they need to fix the "no camp radius" for - just the other day I stumbled upon a fella that had built a floating castle above the Watoga power station (with the frequent deathclaw &amp; ant spawns).
---
And no, I don't mean just the usual "floating camp 50 feet away from the location" as seen at Whitespring, I mean like literally about 20 feet above the deathclaw's spawn point in the middle of all the equipment, very clearly inside the fenced area of the power station.
---
Maybe, but suddenly we are no longer talking about a small UI change...
---
Vendors have a set inventory list now
---
This was the one nearest to the mine shaft entrance. It wasn't by the barrel after the missile explosion, it had moved.
---
Out of curiosity, is it confirmed 24 hours?
---
I might be bugged, because everything I've picked up hasn't reset for a week or two. In fact, I have not been able to trigger Queen of the Hunt for a month. 
---
Anyone else experiencing same concern? I'm on PS4
---
Three Dog's great, great, great, great grandpa lives in vault 96.  Once it opens he is going to head straight for the nearest radio station towers.
---
Back in Patch 5 they changed the Vendor bot plans.
---
Plans are now pretty much set in stone.  There are a handful of items that change, but not many.  The prices were also increased from vendors due to them being always available.
---
Server hopping won't do much for plans from vendors these days.
---
Two words: Private Servers. Then admins can tweak things to the population's content.
---
It's not that they're different, it's that with the inclusion of PvP the mechanics that have been fine up until this point make the PvP feel clunky. Clunkiness is fine against NPCs with V.A.T.S that slows down time, but not against real people in real time. 
---
I dont mind much either, as long as I have on PA.  Spawn in without it or a rad suit on, and it's likey instant death, over and over, unless you are fast enough to make the door before the rads kill you.
---
Annoying if you happen you be carrying lots of junk at the time.
---
Would be better to make the spawn point the lobby instead of the circle outside.
---
Getting  on too
---
Well if i take Battlefield for example, Fallout 76 feels way less clunky to me, but thats just my personal opinion. What exactly do you mean by poor mechanics ?
---
Just run Spotify through your console.. you can even use your phone as a remote control. Your soundtrack for killing ghouls can be anything you want then!. Think there'll be major copyright issues to broadcast it though üëç
---
The excavator set by itself, will increase your carry weight by 100, and if you can find two calibrated shocks mods, you can score an additional 100. If you can find the +2 strength to torso mod, that's another +10.
---
The power armor frame itself will raise your strength to 11, if you're below, but not any higher.
---
You can get calibrated shocks for all of the other sets, but I personally like to carry a frame with the excavator, for the +210 carry weight, and my Xo1 suit with differently modded legs, for more combat utility.
---
I found the calibrated shocks for the excavator set at the harpers ferry vendor, less then 15 server shops circ. Hope this helps.
---
Instead of your general stash being sorted into categories, negating the use of different forms of containers, you should be able to drop loot in different storage, as you would come across loot in the first place. It's an RPG element, allowing players to make their C.A.M.P feel more realistic and functional.  
---
I am aware, so is Ark survival and loads of other games with single player modes though.
---
I would absolutely be modding fallout 4 and building wherever I wanted if my PC could handle it. As it stands, I can't find any ps4 mods that actually work and let me build anywhere. 
---
Yep, I havent been on in a while. Ill be back around 5-6 est
---
My character would definitely be described as a siren.  Sequined dress.  Fashionable glasses.  Bloodied knuckles and a cannibalistic nature.  However I can‚Äôt post pictures to describe how she looks because I suck at the internet.   
---
I've been trying to get the 01 Jetpack for a month, server hopped probably a hundred times. no dice. 
---
There is actually 50 songs, but I see your point. 
---
Nothing stops you from listening to Spotify alongside while you play. 
---
If you're going to be on later today, I'll buy a scaly skin serum.
---
It does help, thank you.
---
Private servers need to be here yesterday  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
I see what you mean about battlefield, but from experience in both games I'd say battlefield is less clunky, not by much admittedly.
---
Well poor mechanics as in the handling of the guns, poor reload speed, poor movement when aiming, terrible movement when coming out of ADS, lack of accessibility to weapons in PVP encounters, or even PVE as well, fallout has never been good at quick weapon switching, but in single player fallouts, where the game pauses, its never been a problem, but it is now, in a fallout where no such pause exists. 
---
The "[new features](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)" in the roadmap of 2019 has a sentry bot, I hope that's foreshadowing.
---
You had me until cannibal!
---
Quick question: does Whitespring have a 100% Deathclaw spawn rate?  It‚Äôs seems like the last few times I‚Äôve been there, I‚Äôve ran into either a Chameleon or an Albino Deathclaw In front of the building people like to place their turret camps
---
Less clunky that Battlefield? Have you even played Battlefield ever in your life?
---
Thanks. Sounds cool.
---
Osnap I didn't even know about the beret. I looked it up and it is *clean*. For me, there's something wonderfully goofy about the owl mask and just how ridiculously *wide* it is.
---
If you don't mind having a teammate without a mic currently, I'm more than happy to play with you
---
Yes you you should be able to make changes to your gas mask. Maybe have less resistance to rads but your mask lasts tiwce as long.
---
Or use a less effect sytstem that looks different but it is uch cheaper so a proper gas mask if hard to make and impossible to find
---
Let‚Äôs just say if the date went bad it would go really, really bad.  
---
If people just spent the same amount of time to google something as they took to post a question to a subreddit, we wouldn't have daily redundent questions. 
---
Oh how I long for that day... 
---
I'm on Xbox one and far harbor never dropped any frames
---
Instead they promote the one foundation and stairs up to a floating platform immersion breaking camps.
---
I ran a pistol build up til level 100 and personally did not find crack shot to be worth it.
---
Best pistol is prob a Western Revolver. Non agility perks id recommend would be mostly in luck - bloody mess bc pistols need the damage boost, better criticals, four leaf clover - vats / critical hit builds work well with pistols, with my 3* pipe pistol I can bust off criticals every second and tear through most enemies. 
---
I‚Äôll take scaly skin 
---
Yes, come join us in the Order of the Owl.
---
wait... lvl 3 unlocks can actually be valuable? 
---
I have lvl 2 [only because of perk packs] and usually skip because it's generally a crap gun, crap ammo, prewar money and a silver locket. 
---
lvl 3 safes sometimes have something worth while in them?
---
It drives me nuts...what a waste of plastic.  This has bit me in the ass a few times but I'm getting better at remembering.   I agree though, if it would avoid it once its bulked or count a bulked item as non scrap at the benches I'd be pretty stoked!
---
I'd love to have one of the custom built robots.  I had a lot of fun sticking together random bits from all the robots together.
---
Anything like we could do in Fallout 4 would be great.  Some cool examples here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/4bhn0s/post\_your\_automatron\_robot\_creations\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/4bhn0s/post_your_automatron_robot_creations_here/) 
---
Couldn't agree more w/ that.... these craft 25 and 50 alcohols a day just for 10 atom rewards kill me. It is way too much. Crafting 5 should be enough for a daily challenge.  
---
I really don't like the extreme specific booze dailies like wear a beer hat, formal coat, drink this certain beer, find this one particular rare enemy, kill them a dozen times while intoxicated, do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around, and worship the dark lord of the abyss for 10 atoms.  That is over the top. Simplify it to generics like kill 5 enemies while intoxicated (from any booze) or kill 5 enemies while wearing a certain article of clothing.  These dailies are getting ridiculous.
---
My observations agree with yours. My nocturnal level 50 deathclaw gauntlet reports  less damage during the day than a level 40 non-legendary. Luckily both are light, so I can swap between them; If only there were a clearer indication of nighttime. It's onerous to keep pulling up the pip-boy to check the time. 
---
2 possibilities here. One, if you keep entering an area before the 24 hours is up and interacting withe the environment (Picking things up) sometimes it seems to get "stuck" and not reset properly.
---
Possibility 2 is that you have a bug. I often go on a plastic scrapping run in Morgantown Highschool. It got stuck for me for a couple days once, not properly re-setting the objects. 
---
Best course of action is to leave the area entirely alone for a couple days. This always fixes the rare "stuck" locations for me. 
---
Ehhh you‚Äôre overthinking it, seems pretty simple to me 
---
I found plenty of Excavator mods @ Camden 
---
if I trade you leather and circuit boards would you leave my precious sexbots \*cough\* robots alone?
---
That's the point, and I think that is the main drawback of this PVP progression, something that Bethesda have possibly overlooked. I expected some people to respond with the likes of "well it wasn't a problem in any fallout before so why now" but it's a glaring oversight to ask that question, and I don't know if the developers have had the same oversight. If they were to try and take fallout 76 down this route with more PVP focused modes, then the mechanics that they have been so used to need to change, because as they stand, fallout combat mechanics and PVP are not compatible. 
---
*‚ÄúWe once tried having Fasnatch Day on Christmas, but it just wasn‚Äôt the same!‚Äù*
---
Yes, that is why I said it feels less clunky compared to fallout. Not by much, but it still has more accessibility than 76
---
The formula is 250 + (Endurance Level * 5), so at max level of endurance you would have 325 HP.
---
You're welcome :) and likewise, I know the feeling. Also hate having numerous fusion cores at like 30% in my inventory too lol
---
Does the insult bot ever say any insults? All I ever hear it say is "hey you! Stop!"
---
This refers to the dark times when cheaters were duplicating the best guns and selling them to everyone. 
---
Bethesda eventually responded by removing all but one of these duplicated items from players inventories. The remaining of these are referred to as legacy guns. You can still find everything afaik but it‚Äôs all much more rare.
---
I think a mic is kinda crucial but if we can play and get stuff done still... sure.
---
Look man I didn‚Äôt choose the raider life the raider life chose me. 
---
i'm assuming Iso checked your post history and saw you were trying to buy an item that was posted to be on Xbox

Famous last words  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
Crafting is easy to explain:
---
Every non-legendary weapon/armor piece in the game can be "scrapped" into base parts with a chance to learn a mod(ification) to that particular piece.
---
You should make it a habit to pick up every single piece of armor you find, as the % chance to learn mods for armor was reduced a few patches ago. If you aren't going to use it, then just scrap it at the next crafting station you see.
---
Weapons -- Have a much higher chance to learn a new mod. Focus on collecting hunting rifles - pipe weapons (of any variety) - combat rifles - assault rifles - handmade rifles - lever action rifles.
---
The "mods" you learn will allow you to customize and/or build a rifle of your choosing. Hardened Receiver - Long Barrels - Suppressor - Armor Piercing Magazines are all mods to look for and use.
---

It is mutation heavy and does require some good weight management. But I am a few hundred hours into this game, and have a good handle on what is important for me to pick up and what isn't.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76Builds/comments/ajqd0m/my_rifleman_build/ is a link to my first Rifleman build with a LOT of detail about why I chose what I did. It is still my highest level character and the one I learned everything on.  While it may not be as efficient in murder as my newer one, it is a lot easier to use and has served me well. It would be very very easy to build towards #2, and once you find out how you like to play, etc tweak it towards however you want.
---
If you play on PC, look me up ingame as BossHondo. Also on twitch with the same username.
---
That would be awesome. Thank you. Hit you up here in PM?
---
That would require PINK POWER ARMOR.   Which, sadly, does not yet exist.  (Unless you are on PC and have screwed with your ini files). 
---
Yes, they sure can! Check out my revised posts with images of at least 3 plans I have found out of them this very night! :)
---
There goes my frame rate 
---
I miss ED-E
---
Tnx for trading :)
---
&gt; In terms of performance it is practically flawless. 
---
Im sry Sir but if you really think this is true i cant help you :D 
---
No for real buddy, every battlefield game since the Frostbyte engine had Performance Problems from the get go. Every single one had tons of Bugs, terrible netcode, and tons of ingame glitches.  I could write a book with the Glitches that were only produced by the vault mechanic so please dont tell me shit like that ;-)
---
This sounds awesome I‚Äôd actually play survival for this!
---
Now that slap damage is gone, adventure mode is basically single player if you want it to be. Aside from the small risk that comes with workshops. 
---
Haha I wish I worked for them! Yeah I know what you mean. We have a friend who got it on ps4 and we can't play with him. I own both consoles purely so I have always have best of both worlds haha. 
---
No mention of the two level 3 wall safes in whitespring? One is in the Manager's office and the other is in the locked room with a cap stash behind the baggage check in robot.
---
Tends to either be armor piece or a uncommon or modded weapon that can be scrapped.
---
Hasn't been crucial for me at least, I'm currently level 68 and not had any hard time getting stuff done.
---
I'm a competent player who's been almost everywhere on the map, done the main quest and all that, so anything you need help with, I'd be a reliable player, but don't feel obligated to say yes if you feel that a mic is crucial, if you'd prefer having talking teammates it's not a problem 
---
The fact that someone tries to compare Battlefield, the second most popular FPS in existence, and the most polished, with the mess that is Survival mode... I don't understand it.
---
When you get duplicates you use them to level a card up
---
Awesome to hear of other people gifting this game! :D 
---
Show don't tell. Writers 101

taking over a power stations workshop will give you a fusion core generator. even if you don't power it up. you get 20 per hour

---
Lol I‚Äôm sure there are ways to mess it up but what makes you think it would be so hard? 
---
Seems like you‚Äôd input how many you‚Äôd want to craft, and then the game would do a random roll as to how many times super duper would proc based on your luck. This is no different than the game doing a random roll every time you craft something and that‚Äôs why I believe it would make the game more stable since it only needs to do the roll once. 
---
I‚Äôm happy to hear reasons why this would be unfeasible especially since I‚Äôm not a game designer or someone who knows how to code. 
---
The owl mask actually goes quite well with the black and red paint for the excavator power armor... Sorry cant remember what the actual name of the paint is.
---
Well that is what the other poster did, not me. Though it seems you're agreeing with the point of my original post, or have I got that wrong. 
---
Didn't get to play either so my sister did and got the owl mask first try. 
---
Cheers, always forget about radsuit. Physically getting hit by gouls doesn't phase me, they don't usually get close enough so the radsuot will probably do me. The SBQ advice is a good shout as well, should have two free points to shuffle into endurance. 
---
The one big thing that bugs me about Survival is always having to pop stealth boys, wear chameleon, or take berry mentats all day long to actually survive a while in combat. The use of VATS (in my opinion only) is way overused and the fact that a VATS Criticals totally ignore all armor, gives u a massive damage boost and gives you 100% accuracy (even if it says 1% chance to hit) is absolutely absurd and people are abusing it as thy should be right now. Add the fact that the critical meter can reset even after one hit with certain perks involved just makes it absurd. This is the only reason I don‚Äôt play survival because it just ends up not being fun to me. But again this my opinion. I‚Äôm sure a lot of other people love it and that‚Äôs just the way it is. 
---
Another worthy addition! Thank you!
---
Thanks! Is the cop hat really considered rare? I see those all the time so I guess it doesn‚Äôt feel like a rare drop 
---
That ones hit or miss. I got two in three hops, spent hours hoping before I found them and haven't seen them since. More people have also progressed to start server hopping there, so you're at the whim of finding a fresh server AND a lottery win with the RNG
---
Am I the only one who's noticed certain songs from the BETA aren't played anymore? I don't think I've heard "Swinging in a star" since then. 
---
Yeah I thought it would require large perk investment or team charisma building. I don't want to have to compromise my build for the sake of armourless nuke zones though so maybe I'll just pop a radsuit on :/
---
You've made me a sad wendigo.
---
I‚Äôd like to be able to fast travel to train stations for free but everywhere else costly. 
---
On the contrary I think a lot of people would agree with you, because that is absurd, yet again advocating the notion that the mechanics for fallout don't work with this new PVP style they are adopting. 
---
Good tips, I'll try that full 24 hour reset one - I think it has worked in the past without me even noticing it. 
---
What‚Äôs the issue you‚Äôre having? 
---
Your post has been here a while so maybe someone here can help? 
---
Anything that is used in a crafting recipe should be changed to not scrap automatically for scrapping all. I always have to now make a mental note whenever I come acrosss the cooking oil. Darn you donuts!!!
---
Yup 
---
Well my interpretation of "Resetting their character" is different from yours then. It sounds more like we'll be resetting out characters... To me that means starting over like you just came out the vault. No plans, no perks, lv1, etc... +Legendary Prefix Modifier
---
I'm not sure how you can say "The focus is clearly on level" 
---
That's just wishful thinking...  
---
They made it so weapons no longer drop with the explosive modifier on energy weapons, flamers, and cryolators.
---
The ones that still exist are the ‚Äúlegacy ‚Äú weapons.
---
I disagree and I mainly play FPS games. Sure the controls are clunkier than CoD but the additional mechanics AKA builds make it more interesting. I love that you lose caps and aid which gives it some significance.
---
Last night I had a running battle (mostly out of VATS range) and it was a ton of fun and felt fluid. I fought a team of 3 and a team of 2 (not working together) for over an hour before they finally claimed my bounty. Other than walking out of the vault for the first time, it was the single best experience I've had in this game.
---
Harsh, i like to think i personally have more than 5 of 15 intelligence, lol. 
---
But really though, its still just as easy to craft the items i want, as i have all of the crafting cards i need. Just a bit more tedious than it needs to be by swapping the cards each time. It doesnt make sense to run a high intelligence (in game) just so you can keep your crafting cards on all the time. 
---
Much more fun searching the green foggy nuke zones @ fissure prime near the huge pink trees. üëç
---
Checked your post history and you had posts that said you were on xbox
---
There are counters to everything including VATS and this is coming from a VATS crit commando build. Survival is filled with bloodied/berserker snipers in chameleon that can kill you long before you get into VATS range. There are also a ton of shotgunners that can kill you from way outside sniper range in 3rd person because it's bugged.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to removing it from Survival but they would need some kind of respec first because there are a ton of perks devoted to VATS that suddenly become worthless. I have a ton of unspent points that I use to move around SPECIAL and take new perks but I'm betting a lot of other people don't.
---
Not only do I think it's true - I am mainly a Battlefield player. So trust me, I know. At least, I know more about it than someone who tries to compare Battlefield to a game that crashes twice every hour, has massive FPS drops, missing/messed up textures that change from minute to minute, has a bug in which players are invisible since launch, players teleport because the servers are total crap... I could go on and on.
---
The vault mechanic? You mean the same vault mechanic that has been fixed since Battlefield 1? Is that all you have?
---
You can say all you want about Battlefield's netcode, but at least I don't have to unload a whole magazine into someone on their knees only to see they still live. Oh, and their health actually goes down, *it doesn't regenerate automatically* like it happens in F76 thanks to a bug that, again, has been there since **launch**.
---
I'm sorry, it's just ridiculous trying to compare a polished and established FPS to this mess that is Survival mode.
---
It's why it's called an opinion, but we can try to play without you having a mic until otherwise. I currently need to see what I have to do, then I'll be on and we can play.
---
Does Cheat Terminal not have the "place workbench" function anymore? I used to spawn them all over, each one gives you a fairly large build radius, and with something like "Scrap Everything" you're even able to remove cars, trash piles and many other things. I used this to build outside the Museum of Freedom, clearing out the building opposite and slightly to the left. I used XBONE so I'm unsure if the same mods are available for PS4
---
They definitely have some kinks to work out and it‚Äôs only BETA so we‚Äôll see where it goes. As of now it‚Äôs just not for me, I wanna love it, just can‚Äôt right now 
---
Indeed; if they want Survival to succeed (and something tells me they simply don't care), it needs massive, *massive* work.
---
You could get a +1 Endurance on each equipment piece for +5, then I believe BOS Shielded is +3 Endurance?  And Herd Mentality could be used for another +2 Endurance.  And I'm not sure if the Strange In Numbers increases that further.  I know Class Freak leaves me with a -0.5 (-2 * 0.25 ) Str for use with my Str to Carry Weight calculation, as with it on I drop 2.5 (rounded to 3 on display) carry weight.
---
15 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 25 Endurance.  Possibly 25.5 if the numbers work out with Strange in Numbers the same as it does with Strength and Carry Weight.
---
No I don't see how, fog will mean the game renders less infront of you. The fog in far harbour if anything increased my frames
---
I‚Äôm in a blast zone in whitespring, is there any ?
---
I got this once. 
---
Level up 1 time while intoxicated on fermented alcohol in the ash heap
---
Sounds like you've made your interpretation of the prestiege system as fact in your head.  Why wouldn't they have you re-learn plans? No one knows anything about prestiege. Everything here is a wash, pointless conversation, speculation. You could be just as wrong as he is.
---
Damn... I guess I'm of to treasure hunt :D
---
Isn‚Äôt a type of particle effect?
---
This! I‚Äôve been trying to make donuts for ages but I keep forgetting and scrapping my cooking oil :(
---
to be honest the only reason people complained is because they were all running around in power armor frames and couldn't use a light with out a helmet... 
---
If you put a pressure plate behind your gate or door, when it opens your alarm sounds to let you know someone is entering your camp.
---
That said, they do have a habit of going off on their own though mate.
---
You didn't get scammed. You weren't paying attention. Not trying to pick a fight here, but you had to mash the button once to select the item, and then mash it again to confirm.
---
When someone changes the price of an item, it resorts the offer list because an item was changed.
---
Was they player a douche for changing the price last minute... sure. But ultimately you still clicked the button twice.
---
Start buying stuff from new players at absurd prices, or running errands for you, so that they have fast travel money etc. while learning their way around the game. Think of yourself as a Venture Capitalist.
---
I'm a little late on this, but from my point of view, people probably downvoted you because you're using an insane set of weapons and armor, one or two-shotting level 94 Deathclaws, and then saying that they should be buffed. People might already have a tough time with deathclaws because most don't have as good of a gear set as you (or just aren't as high a level) and with you and your OP gear saying they should be stronger sounds a bit ridiculous. Not my belief, just what I think people downvoted you for.
---
Not enough to make stable (need 10). There are some snaptail reeds by the golf course you can harvest, but I think it's only like 8 max with Green Thumb

"I have been sent by  XXXXX to tell you..." I would like customized messages, but would settle for some poorly crafted childish insults. He just needs to be consistent.

I have encountered him so many times it feels like he is being sent by someone to insult me. Unfortunately most of the time he does nothing, but follow me like a creepy stalker. I have been successfully insulted twice though, and received my report to indicate such. Funny.

Okay, thanks a lot !
---
The only counter to VATS is stealth boys, crouching or chameleon and that just makes the game wayyyyy to slow for me to enjoy. But again that‚Äôs my opinion. I‚Äôm sure the people that are using VATS builds are having a tonne of fun but people who don‚Äôt seem to be at a disadvantage unless we spend caps on items to use to make it a level playing field 
---
Yea but that a bug this is a suggestion 
---
Making the experience more interesting doesn't account for poor mechanics and controls. What builds are interesting that you wouldn't find in another FPS?
---
I don't see that as an objective, valid argument against why the mechanics in fallout don't work with unrestricted PVP elements.
---
Could you elaborate on how losing caps and aid gives it some significance?
---
The gun racks would count as stash boxes
---
I don't think it's that rare. I just vended like 5 of them from my stash.
---
Looks like somebody is stocking up on legendaries for the new Legendary Vendor update :D
---
I lost an Ambien once. I see you found it.
---
I have no idea and haven't got this helm myself. I followed the discussion when they left the dev room and seen how Bethesda reacted. Bethesda reacted properly IMO, banned those who penetrated dev room, removed all 'illegal' items from game, replaced these illegal items with a cosmetic non-combat alternatives and allowed legit ways for obtaining alternatives. Problem perfectly solved.
---
The fashnat event did that when it first launched. It was great to find out this was a thing back the.  Apply the same for a events when they start and we're golden on event flagging.
---
I won't be on until later I've got work soon, but I'll add you when I get back and let you know when I'm on online 
---
Iv been offloading those since my first week 
---
Alright
---
I don‚Äôt know. But the guy that made that sheet is the expert on this topic.  Most of the rare items are outfits.    Plus shielded raider underarmor plans, BOS combat armor modification plans, dense chest plans, some drink recipes.   
---
You can get those at fort defiance too if you happen to be looking for them 
---
If u want I‚Äôll be your dealer üòÇ
---
It's the same for me, I don't actually dislike survival mode, the +20% xp makes it more tolerable, but it is overshadowed by the poor mechanics 
---
All energy based weapons that had explosive effects got removed from the loot-table until Bethesda has an idea on how to change them.
---
Are u on ps4 
---
Ahhh shucks sadly not 
---
Im guilty of this....i have tons of 3 star armor that ive made lightweight just to stash
---
Oh ok have a good day
---
What platform are you on dude?
---
I usually hit the train car down from Watoga station when selling to vendors which has a plan spawn, then the repair yard just past that which has a plan and mod spawn. And if anyone happens to find an extra dense comabt armor chest plan on xb1, I'd be forever grateful lol.
---
the yellow bar is 100%.  The thin white line through the middle of the yellow bar is the "over-repair."   The two perks - one for weapons, the other for armor, let you repair to &gt;100%...superimposes the white line.  
---
Until the wite line is gone and the yellow bar gets shorter, the pip boy is correct, the item doe not need to be repaired.
---
That's something I can strongly agree on. I think they need to really consider if PVP is the right path for this game with the atrocious combat mechanics fallout has. 
---
Yeah same. Whenever I have to relog at whitesprings due to server disconnect I pray for not landing on a nuked zone session.
---
I've seen place workbenches anywhere mods but the one I tried never let me actually go into workshop mode anywhere. It was years ago now tho. I'll have to look again.
---
I m aware but are there just like 2-4 plans per vendor? it seems a bit off
---
Those are good counters, using cover to your advantage also helps break VATS. This is definitely not Call of Duty where you kill, die, spawn, kill, die, spawn and getting to a spot on a linear map means you have an advantage. I enjoy both but seeing how this game works has opened my mind to what shooters could be. This is by no means perfect and frankly this conversation is pointless given how much duping took place. We really have no idea what it would be like if everyone didn't have bloodied explosive {{insert weapon}} and {{insert assassin's/sentinel/cavalier/unyeilding}} armor.
---
It's not a bug. Power Armor increases your Strength to 11. So if your Strength is already 11 or more, it does nothing. 
---
 I read someone‚Äôs comment this morning about welders mask being rare and I literally dropped that two days ago ... i really need to educate myself on what‚Äôs good to trade and what‚Äôs worthless. I definitely don‚Äôt have enough free time to commit to this game as well as a lot of players here can but I still want to enjoy it and not make dumb decisions 
---
Fireproof is worth the points. It has a lot of uses between PvP and PvE.
---
A fun side note with it, if you pair it with Ghoulish 3, you can fill your HP by standing on a car and blowing it up. Good fun.
---
I was not comparing the game itself i was just talking about the mechanics. I played every Battlefield game since 1942 and to call the newest derivates the most polished is ... well an overstatement.
---
Same, I've never seen that or monster mash event actually happen.  It's a bug reason the pvp being forced feels like a poor choice.
---
The other fix would be to have the whitespring fissure site scorchbeast path down towards that area whenever there's a base there.
---
Do you yell out "Nerf this!" when you combat exit your power armour too?
---
Yes but you can see less so it could not do anything to the framerate. I'm talking thicker than far harbour fog
---
I can see the argument for this, but prices would need to be astronomical. With pre-war inflation, a cup of coffee and a doughnut was $50. I can only imagine how much a bone-healing stimpack would cost.
---
Hmmm alright, I‚Äôll take your word for it 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I trashed two BOS Bomber jackets back when they sold for 1500 caps.  I know the shame.  But it heals with time.  
---
So that would make it 475 health.
---
Take over the workshops at the 3 nuclear power plants, they have resource machines which produce fusion cores. 
---
Yeah bloody mess is a must but when i have class freak, starched genes and bloody mess thats already 8 points in luck
---
This is the correct answer. 
---
Every power plant has a workshop nearby with a Fusion Core Generator that makes them at 100%
---
Every power armor chassis spawns with one inside (currently always 25% charge, since Patch 7)
---
Every fusion generator found in the wild has a chance to spawn a Fusion Core (random charge, random whether or not it's there)
---
And then fusion cores can spawn inside Ammo Boxes (rare) and in fixed locations around the game.  There is a spawn ontop of one of the computer consoles at the Relay Tower just west of Flatwoods, I always would grab it when I went there each day for Ballistic Fiber when I was a lower level.
---
Power Plant Workshops are by far the easiest and the fastest.  Plus they are 100% from there, meaning you get the most bang for your carry weight.
---
Oh really   Thanks aloft 
---
I'd pay for real life ones.
---
Use Doorways, if you place a foundation, then a doorway you can remove the foundation and the wall will stay. Be careful though as while no foundation is attached you won't be able to delete anything so I'd finish your build then remove the foundation last. Works extremely well for greenhouse builds with space to actually plant things.
---
There are dozens of plans per vendor.  Their list is HUGE now.  BOS Phoenix has a list so long it's annoying to browse thru.
---
Some vendors don't sell many though.  Like Whitespring Station, he only sells each Wall Building Set for Camps and the Walking Cane plan.
---
Yeah, they have 100% battery but these workshops are usually highly sought after so try be prepared pvp. 
---
I can elaborate... you feel actual gain and loss. I killed someone last night that dropped 20 stealth boys. I was elated, he was probably regretting carrying so many. I'd like to see us lose weapons and armor but I know I'm in a huge minority with that view. 
---
Again... I'm not saying it's perfect. Factions and controlling resources would help immensely by making this more than just a standard shooter. You need resources to compete so why not make us fight for the best ones.
---
You can buy a fusion core in the military wing of the enclave vendor. Price is around 275-400 caps? 
---
Treasure maps are individual items. I was in the Rhythm of tapping the button and also the reason I kept spamming even though the offer change icon came up is because the trade menu is super laggy and if you click the button too fast it doesn't always register the trade it will say "trade failed" so you have to press it again meaning it isn't just mash the button once and then again, you could press the button 6 times and it would keep reverting. When you are buying multiple items like this you get in the rhythm of having to press the button more than 2 times ever so often so when the change item thing happened my brain just assumed it was a trade fail again and so I kept pressing
---
They knew exactly what they were doing, they didn't just randomly make an item 2750 caps hoping I would fall for it, they layed out 10 individual items and as soon as I was on the last one they changed the price because you can have it ready.
---
I'm used to everyone being friendly meaning if the trade didn't go through I'm immediately going to assumed it was the trade failed because of lag rather than someone bumping up the price to 2750.
---
It's not going to happen again because now I've seen there are genuine douchebags out there, every trade I'm gonna take my time. That was my original point.
---
What is the enclave may I ask is that a faction 
---
So clarify, it cannot be moved without tearing it into different blueprints that cannot be stacked again. 
---
I feel your pain... several times over! They got the hint on dogwood bark. Forbidden DONUT!
---
But did you notice any change in vats when using crack shot since it gives better range and accuracy? 
---
Up vote for not spelling it rEdiculous.
---
Stack walls ontop until you can place a roof piece? If you can connect that roof to foundations in anyway then it'll let you scrap it all
---
Mods are still random.  And X-01 mods only exist as mods, not as plans.
---
Jet Pack and Calibrated Shock mods are some of the rarest vendor items in the game.
---
I think the blues era of music and a little of the early blues influenced rock and country would also be fitting.
---
Be careful with workshops. One (or a team of) player(s) can contest your claim on it, giving them the ability to freely attack you even if you're not actually at the workshop. 
---
Also the machine that produces Fusion Cores requires 100 power to work. 
---
you're forgetting the point that some people will have already entered the code and therefore won't need to enter it again that week
---
Why would that be atoms.. Not caps? 
---
Yeah absolutely right man the duping to start this game has made it ridiculous how easy end game weapons were to acquire. Good talk man. 
---
There was a good bit of that between the forties and the sixties. 
---
Snap tail is violet? If so there's a small river that could have potentially more than 8 with green thumb.  Plus a small pond on the opposite side of Whitesprings that has a few.
---
Is posiden a good place to have the workshop 
---
It‚Äôs not that I think it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs just that I have no reason to think it‚Äôs *easy*. We can write pseudocode until the cows come home to show how easy it *could* be, but without knowing the reality of how those systems work, how things are stored and validated, there‚Äôs just no telling how easy it *is*.
---
‚ÄúEasy‚Äù and ‚Äúhard‚Äù simply aren‚Äôt intuitive terms in game development. Well, at least ‚Äúeasy‚Äù isn‚Äôt. If something sounds hard it usually is. 
---
Because bloodied.
---
What's your health at? What perks do you have equipped? Mutations? There's so much that goes into damage numbers. But if I remember right, black powder pistol is the highest base damage pistol soooo.....
---
dang... been just skipping them all like "meh, waste of time probably"... how many plans did I miss?
---
#HOW MANY PLANS DID I MISS?!
---
You too!
---
Ohh that sounds fun. I use fireproof on my heavy weapons build to shrug off assultrons death beam and scorchbeast spam and to avoid killing myself... My current set up definitely has wiggle room for perks, just got to tweak my luck choices as there's so many good perks in that stat... 
---
What about u/lonevaultwanderer :3
---
Might team and I take them over regularly.  Rarely are we contested.  And there are three of them per server, usually Thunder Mnt and Monograh are untouched, it's just Posiden that is taken all the time.
---
I was just talking about this with my friend and we both agreed the prices for medical supplies would be intense 
---
I've been on the hunt for shadowed plans for all armors, is this a good way of trying to farm them? Different wikis only mention random event awards as sources for shadowed plans. 
---
I don't use white knight except when repairing armor. I swap demolition rank 5 for stabilized rank 3 and demolition rank 2 when in power armor. I tried serendipity but I don't use a low hp build. I swap cards based off of using ranged or melee more. 
---

---
\^Accurate. Having a suit of Excavator Power Armor is a huge help. It has a natural +100 carry weight buff. Toss a pair of optimized servos on it for another 100.
---
Last time I was near where the deathclaw usually spawns I got a grafton monster instead so I guess not 100%
---
Ya.  If you give that weapon to a full health non-bloodied build, it will likely be significantly lower damage.
---
Or shows all the mods available but greyed out until learned then change to white to show it can be used to mod 
---
one hand melee/sniper ... in a clown suit.
---
Yes. Find some time where you can take poseidon and just sit there to farm the fusion cores. Made about 25 in 2 hours or so, and I haven't needed to go back for about a month. I don't consistently use PA though, so...
---
i am in favor.  could even tie building robots to camp budget; like turrets, etc.  if using them for defense.  need to find the balance between having cool robots and allowing one to enslave the wasteland with your army of sentrybots
---
Sure...put yourself on the leader board and get farmed for caps by ebay-bought gear whores. No thanks! At least not till it has some major adjustments.
---
Yeah, mount thunder is my go to for cores, usually take it solo after repairing the power plant first. 
---
Pistolero Bro here calling my build a stealthy assassin.
---
My suggestion would be to go with 10mm because its easy to build and ammo is easy to find. But it's also easy to get spent.
---
I mainly use my suppressed 10mm with VATS so I'll pumped in several shots for that increasing sustained damage from perks.
---
However I'll also recommend carrying other pistols also such as a pipe which has a much higher damage but lower fire rate. I generally use this when I can 1 shot any perps.
---
I would also carry a .44 to rotate with the other pistols because as I said ammo can get spent very quickly. This I use mostly for a sniping.
---
Frankly it's not gonna be the strongest build and I still have fears taking on a SB alone at level 45 but I thoroughly enjoyed being immersed in the game world as my character and I think you just roll with whichever build or weapon you fancy. 
---
Maybe remove the cost of moving if you haven't placed anything?
---
The issue i am having is this:  
---
everytime i try to play my first playthrough as i just bought it yesterday.
---
the following happens.  
---
\- intro rolls in "Bethesda game studios presents .....   FALLOUT 76"   
---
\- Prompt appears with "Server not responding controls are temporarely disabled"  
---
\- black screen comes in with a mouse cursor  
---
\- Does nothing for the rest of the time i leave it there.  
---
Someone on the actual bethesda forums told me its my ISP  
---
i tried a "tracert" command and i am not getting past the first hop.  
---
My brother using a different ISP tried it.  
---
Passed 30 hops with around 10 requests timed out.  
---
I am not really hopefull about this issue :(   
---
Also tried disabling my anti virus and firewall  
---
rescanning my game didn't fix anything...
---
They are annoying as hell , don‚Äôt do it!!
---
Probably faster to drop a nuke.  Hit that forest in the SE by SBQ spawn.  What your looking for is ferns by the little clusters of trees that ring said forest.  Can get well over a hundred violet from there.
---
Easiest one to claim, but also the easiest to travel to. You'll probably find that one already claimed by another player the most often out of all three and also the one that is most likely to get contested by other players when you claimed it. 
---
Probably using nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and the pistol damage perks under agility. If you use adrenaline under agility, the numbers get high really quick 
---
Explain to me how you can be lazy in a video game anyway lmao
---
I don't care what you think, so you think whatever you like and I'll play the game however I want. There's no rule against stealing a nuke. It's a videogame about the apocalypse, there's not many rules to begin with. 
---
In a videogame that's so open, where we are encouraged to join the raiders, the enclave, the brotherhood, we make our own story and some of us are bound to be villains. 
---
So let the haters hate, say what you want, think what you want. I'm enjoying the game my way. And you know what I do with people who bother me? I block 'em and switch servers. Simple as that. It's what Bethesda tells us to do. It's how they want us to play the game. So be it.
---
Right I get that, but what‚Äôs the difference between the way super duper procs for one item vs. how it would proc on a craft all function? 
---
There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a real difference there and if we were ever to get a craft all function then the majority of the fan base would want Super Duper to work with it so I doubt we‚Äôd get one without the other. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs more complicated than it sounds but there are plenty of much more complicated features in this game that work well, I think the devs could manage this.
---
Okay I‚Äôll do as you said, I should get the green thumb perk right ?
---
Well im guessing this is the monkey's paw price we pay for cheaper atom shop items.
---
My luck is only 8, but I do see a lot of 1* weapon with decent effects, just any chance at a 3* from an enemy is either a crap item, or a 1* item.
---
Powering up the Plant is a waste of time imo, as I can just place a Fusion Generator and get the thing running right away.
---
What machine
---
What level are you? A run of Watoga nets quite a few.
---
Yes enclave is a faction, it's part of a quest line to get access.
---
I miss when the pre tse nerf I had a gunslinger build and my tse western was hitting 1300 and the tse black powder pistol about 2300. That was without adrenal reaction and only two cards maxed lol 
---
48
---
What are some of the rare plans you‚Äôve found or can find doing this
---
There has to be some songs in the public domain out there somewhere. 
---
Pro Tip... if the plan name starts with (KNOWN) dont be an asshole, dont pick it up, youre not doing any one else a favor by hording plans that some one might have come looking for. 
---
&gt; So trust me, I know. At least, I know more about it than someone who  tries to compare Battlefield to a game that crashes twice every hour, 
---
Like i said i was compairing game mechanics, im sorry if you cant make a difference between 2 topics. Bad coding isnt considered a game mechanic, at least not by my standarts. 
---
&gt; The vault mechanic? You mean the same vault mechanic that has been fixed since Battlefield 1? Is that all you have? 
---
Fixed since BF1 XD XD come on man ? 
---
&gt; You can say all you want about Battlefield's netcode 
---
Battlefield 3 worst netcode in history, Battlefield 4 same (fixed 2 years after release), Battlefield 1 = same netcode as 3 at the start.

FO76 is not a level based goal oriented game like say WoW. It is an get outside and explore survival "lite" game. Pick a region, say the "forest" for example, and find/explore every location in that zone. Pick up and scrap every gun/armor piece you find. That will do a few things for you:
---
You knowledge of the map will be amazing. You would be amazed how many "high level" players don't know where anything is. You will not have that problem.
---
You will be 100% self reliant. You won't be on the forums asking for this particular mod/plan/crafted item, because you will know them all. 
---
Capture a workshop everytime you play. Build and power up all the extractors you can using the "green" resources that come with the workshop. Leave them unlocked. You wont need the resources, but other players will, and if they are unlocked they can just take them without contesting the workshop. Stock it with a stash box and some benches and a bed. I use workshops for three reasons only: Free fast travel, free camp, and capture/defend missions.
---
You get free loot which often includes plans every time you defend a workshop. It adds up over time, waaay up over time.
---
In fact, you are better off avoiding the main storyline until level 50 so that all the rewards you get from it along the way will all be max level. 
---
The Mistress of Mysteries quest line can be done at any level, as the items can be upgraded along the way up to level 45.
---
I haven't seen anything current and correct on youtube in a long long time. But to be honest, I havent really looked all that hard either. The game changes too much too fast for that stuff to remain relevant anyway.
---
Hope this helps.
---
I saved up all my maps (along with most quests) until I was over level 50, I had quite a map collection by then.  Easily 30-40 maps if not more.
---
Sadly, aside from supplies, nothing dropped that was really worth the trouble.  I don't believe I got a single plan, armor piece, or weapon that I wanted to keep.
---
Yeah i have a Anti Armor vats hit chance 10mm pistol waiting for me when i hit lvl 45 and inteded to use it as my "main" weapon and just like you some kind of revoler higher dmg/sniper pistol on side and maybe a black powder pistol if i happen to find one with really good effects. And do you have any experince in crack shot perk in perception, would like to know if its worth to soend points on? 
---
This DLC gave my level 113 character its first addiction.  It's time to stop.
---
It's called a "Fusion Core Processor". It looks like [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/6/64/Fusion_core_processor.png/revision/latest?cb=20181205192106).
---
I just found I need to go to school now
---
I enjoy repairing it, as a solo player it's great for xp. 
---
I'll add you. I normally play in the evenings after work. I'm level 108 and have some extra plans and Fasnacht crap to share.
---
What about the level 3 safe behind the door in Fort Defiance, top floor last door on the left, has anyone said that? I'm pretty sure I came across it last night and it was level 3.
---
You are an angel. Thank you! 
---
Thanks man, I'll check it out üëç And I just must be having really good luck because I've been getting some seriously good shit past couple days (heavy bolstering sentinel robot leg best so far)... I wonder if they have made it so luck affects it (which it should) because I'm a bloodied build, so my luck is always 30 plus in my unyielding... been getting decent technical data drops too.
---
If it is an open world spawn say player A spawns a plan and player B loots it, does player A need to wait 24 hours?
---
Also if A spawns a plan, will it despawn for player B to spawn his own? 
---
Absolutely. It‚Äôs very unnecessary for pvp and pve.
---
I‚Äôll give you a build in a few mins that I use for my melee, and he shreds (but he doesn‚Äôt have a pvp Armor set so he‚Äôs not used often there)
---
Sounds good. TheDarkness0ne is my gt, message me whenever you add me..
---
You clearly asked what other minority I was so that you could harass me over it in my safe space.  
---
seriously. I was SO happy for the hotfix that rolled out that afternoon that fixed whatever it was but quickly realized it caused this to happen  ...
---
No thanks, I've always hated weather effects in games. Give me nice sunny skies.
---
How do you make sure you switch server? I sometimes wait for 30 secs in the game menu to reenter the game, but it throws me back to the same world. 
---
i cannot upvote this enough.  
---
Way too broken for multiplayer. I loved the robots in the Mechanist DLC as much as the next guy, but they were ridiculously OP. 
---
People would just mule their stash. Beth is aware of that.
---
you may want a laser pistol or rifle with the beam spliter. for the shotgun style blasts
---
Cuz Sony isn‚Äôt a fan of cross platform 
---
I doubt its a test for online or single player.....everything is online multiplayer now. Like it or not
---
Maybe to test how they can combine the two and make both play styles possible.....
---
Haha I just want to be able to see my keypads for my doors. It's like I cover them with my hand so I cant see.
---
I‚Äôm really looking for that them people who have Deathclaw pets. You know how much leather you can get from Deathclaw hide? That‚Äôs not even including the black titanium and loss screw drop. I mean what are they thinking there are loss screws in them. Lose screws man. I would sell my own mother to a slaver for lose screws. 
---
Yes, that's normal.
---
it's not unusual, fallout 2 used fallouts 1s assets and New Vegas used fallout 3s assets
---
Did you want to consider the Lifegiver perk card too or just plain endurance? 
---
Honest opinion. It was worth it back in January and it's worth it now.
---
Killed 20 players and hacked terminals I tracked by checking challenges I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a challenge for reviving 
---
Safe space?. Whatever snowflake.. if harrasing you is calling you an asshole.. maybe you should take a little snoop through your comments and see where all this started.. you're happy to dish out shitpost comments (yes I have looked through your comment history). Yet you seem completely unable to accept people calling you on your bullshit without calling "bully" "homophobe" "racist".. you're just a troll man.. a troll who can't take being called an asshole.. can't take people calling you one? Maybe stop being one.. entitled little prick üñïüñïüñï
---
If he gives you a usable item, you'll see the notification in the top left of the screen.  
---
If you don't see the notice, then check your inventory...notes, I think...you may have a notice telling you you have won a brand new Corvega, or 100k USD.
---
Hope someone doesn't open the convenience store of the future next door. The quicker stop, with a selection of adult magazines.
---
I have no idea.
---
Unfortunately since Patch 7, Fusion Cores inside Chassis always spawn at 25% (no word on whether or not intentional, but at this point, seems to be).
---
So the 4x Watoga PA Chassis will be pretty garbage, though you can luck out with the Fusion Generator inside the Transit hub, and I think occasionally a Core spawns on a shelf/cabinet inside there.
---
Yeah...i do this...sometimes im even suprised at how insane the damage is i get from some things. The problem is...at that point im 1 or 2 hits from dying. Risk/reward
---
I did not know there were plans for these. Makes sense now why i always see so many top hats in vendor inventory. Those and the Marine mask; there must be plans for those too. Anyone know where?
---
Not gonna lie, I'd love to kill time waiting for my booze to ferment by fishing.  We could even have messages in a bottle that fish up plans or just extra bits of lore.
---
Weirdly, I came across Dense a few times yesterday, not for Combat Armor, but for Marine and *Leather* armor.  Wasn't even aware the latter was a thing.  Found it at the vendor in inner Grafton.
---
Then, I randomly found a piece of Dense Robot Chest Armor.  Expecting nothing, I scrapped it.  And I did unlock a mod... Asbestos Lining (Bethesda...).
---
Sorry that you are getting salty about a simple discussion on the Internet. You must be really fragile, so I will try not to be too harsh.
---
So you say you are comparing game mechanics... and then you start talking about bugs and netcode? Gotcha. Try to make up your mind and then come back, please.
---
Thanks for your participation. Dismissed.
---
There is no way the vendor list is static, when I got hung up (cafe tables-raider) I would ask a friend to look and it would spawn for them, even tho I had checked 60 times lulz
---
After patch 5 I thought the CAMP plan market would be DOA but it‚Äôs alive and well. I hop Grahm a LOT and 2-3 items will change every time you log but sometimes it takes me an hour to get one radiation emitter. I think he is the most extreme example left but the other vender items do seem to rotate too
---
Anyways all this changes in less than a week :) I do hope Grahm is still a pain in the ass tho or I will go broke haha. If you‚Äôre on PS I can help you find whatever you need :) 
---
WHAT A HORRIBLE NIGHT TO HAVE A CURSE.
---
This weeks was the opposite of painful... I killed someone last night and the reward message popped up. I had no clue wtf was going on until someone in party told me it was the weekly challenge reward for survival. I thought it was a laggy legendary message from helping someone mule earlier.
---
How many different browsers did you try to submit your ticket? If you haven‚Äôt tried multiple browsers (eg Firefox or Chrome), I‚Äôd start there. A ticket is where tech support belongs. 
---
Why do you have bulked junk in your inventory?
---
What I wouldn't give to accent my Fire Breather CAMP with a fireman Protectron.
---
LMFAO
---
This guy knows what's up.
---
There‚Äôs no way to combine them. There are a couple things you can do though:
---
Take the batteries included perk. This reduces the weight by 90% iirc.
---
Take one of the power plants and do the power up quest. All three plants have a fusion core generator that produces 100% charged fusion cores. They require 100 power but they‚Äôre usually linked to power boxes that create 100 power when the power up quest is completed.
---
Using the two methods above, I keep 5 fully charged cores in the stash, and the rest on my person. I keep a lot on me because I practically live in power armor. Even so, you normally don‚Äôt need more than 20.* Last I checked I have about 36 mixed charges; so next time I get on, I‚Äôll probably dropped my lowest charged cores until I‚Äôm at 20 or 25.
---
*Even 20 is overkill for just PA use.
---
interesting
---
Absolutely, I hate drinking alcohol and taking chems, the reward simply isn't worth it imo. I've still only drank the 1 bottle of nukashine required for the quest, and I intend to keep it that way. So if we could get back to the normal dailies, that'd be great.
---
Well played, Clerk... well played...
---
&gt; Particularly when the vendor is out in the open and you have to kill 20 super mutants to check if the vendor has what you want. 
---
It's very easy to get in and out without killing a thing, with just a little bit of sneaking

Ill take it get a hold of me in game

I like this idea a lot. There are some events, like One Violent Night, that I will do anytime I see it on the map. It would be nice to be notified anytime it launched, but --by the same token--I don't necessarily want a screen pop every time Fertile Soil or Powering Up Poseidon kicks off. Flagging would be perfect.
---
This. I regret the purchase.

Yesterday I decided to try out the new Wild Appalachia for the first time, to find out the hard way. I had no problem with the game play and in fact I survived till the bitter end. But 1 of 2 things set me off, when I was attacked, my game froze and I couldn't defend myself, and when killed I lost way more than ever excepted, I found that to be a serious problem. I  lost 300 regular Stimpaks 150 super Stimpaks, 250 Radaway, all other medical supplies, all my scrap and 1500 caps, personally I was under the impression that you lost a portion of your medical supplies not all, 1500 caps that is 100% more than double? The fact that the game gliched, I could live with but the rest is more than deceiving, according to what was posted about the game play in this new mode. Yes I could have been a little bitch and put all my medical supplies in my stash box, like most players, but I only expected to lose maybe 25 stimpaks and 200-300 caps and scrap, not 3 weeks of hard work!  You are honestly loosing me here! Not that it matters anyway! I wish everyone the best, I hope everyone else has better luck than I did. 
---
This can be closed as temporarely resolved as i tried some different DNS settings and this has made me get through the intro. I am also able to tracert [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) which i couldn't before.   
---
So for anyone who has the same issue.   
---
Try using a different DNS.
---
Oh good idea! I‚Äôll check the challenges for atoms. Thank you!
---
Not gonna lie I have a gas mask on almost all the time
---
Either from fire breather outfit or power armor
---
Sounds a lot like Strong from Trinity Tower.
---
Okay so this is a great idea 
---
u/Valseek 
---
I goto asylum since it almost always kicks off Line in the Sand event.  That gives one or two cores every time.
---
It depends on the card.  If a card has multiple stars on it, then getting a duplicate will allow you to Rank Up the card and get another star.
---
Now, for Picklock, each of those has one star, so in that case, you don't rank them up to gain Picklock skills.  You need to find the Picklock, Expert Picklock, and Master Picklock cards, and their availability unlocks based on your level.
---
Perks like Slugger do both.  There are Slugger, Expert Slugger, and Master Slugger perks, each with 3 stars you can potentially have, but Expert and Master unlock as you level.  This is generally true of most weapon-specific damage perks.
---
Agreed. Places like this should be instanced
---
Just a heads up, there are two fairly easy routes you can take to get to the Harper's Ferry vendor without having to bother with the enemies. From the fast travel point run straight ahead into the hole in the building, go around to the back then up the alley to the vendor. The second is running parallel to the trains to the second open car (you may have to sneak or run past some enemies buy the first opening), then over the crashed cars and into the destroyed house and up the hill to the vendor. You can usually sneak into the house without aggro'ing the enemies further up the street.
---
There are two cop caps in the game with the same display name. The rarer version (though I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one of the rarest items in the game) has a red band around the bottom and looks quite a bit cleaner than the all blue version. 
---
Randomly found the marine mask. Doesn‚Äôt make you *nearly* as much profit because it requires more than 1 cloth
---
They‚Äôre trying to save the game, not kill it again 
---
The way I see it: we don't know what the bills are in each stack of pre-war money; they could be $50s or $100s or even $1K each. So a stack of bills comprising 1 pre-war money could be $10k or more.
---
Killed a 2* in Watoga ... didn‚Äôt explode ...
---
No your base takes damage. I "think" what the op is referring to is the fact that foundations can't be destroyed. You will find ranked people on various places on the map who are hiding behind a base made of foundations. The tunnels in the cranberry bog being the one I see the most because a couple concrete foundations can wall you in completely.
---
Some areas are notably better for plans, in order of quality I dig; Cranberry Bog, Savage Divide, &amp; Mire, all other maps I Trade/Sell off.
---
Go to market and bazaar, buy a sentinel set, invest in some legacy weapons as long term investments, get competitive gear, buy full suits of power armor, hire some mercenaries, use the money to open a store. There's tons to do.
---
Can also happen with Distant Thunder. I've spawned into then only to see the local enemies destroying the quest mobs.
---
Take laxatives a half hour before playing and push 'n squeeze every time you see one. Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
Yes I found two last night. Both came from Camp Venture.
---
Thanks for that tip, I didn't know that. It may come in useful with the 25% in world ones BS and workshops being a waste of time / PvP risk.
---
That bites, but at least both chassis and fusion cores are relatively easy to come by.  Many of the spawn points have 2 cores. - if the armor isnt there, still normally one core somewhere close by. 
---
 Theres one place in the forest which on a good day, will provide 4 cores, and another that has 3.
---
Spend a session visiting the PA spawn points and you should be good to go again.  
---
My OG toon was also specced for heavy guns. My 2nd is a VATS crit rifle build. Pretty fun to play with. You should also consider a melee build as that's the most powerful atm.
---
If you're on ps4 you can have one of my extras :\]
---
It was likely a bloodied explosive handmade.
---
Depends on the player. For me all the cosmetic items are not worth the time. You can make 10k in two weapon trades easily. You can sometimes earn stuff that can't be bought for caps. My best deal so far was to buy a weapon for 5k and sell it for armor piece and a weapon which both were so good that if you offered to sold them for 25k they'd be sold instantly and you'd be considered stupid by your buyers. I really don't know why that particular player sold me AAE Hunting Rifle for caps but I was sure to earn at least ten times more from that item. The only cosmetic items that could ever give you such profit are those that were temporarily available long ago - i.e. the last events masks - but the ones that are not super common were super expensive from the first second of their existence, with less than 10 confirmed drops total.
---
Like most of the quest rewards, the weapons they've datamined are unique, but not amazing.  So, I just don't bother.  I have enough junk wasting space in my Stash that I keep around because it's unique and nothing else.
---
Love it 
---
I'm pretty sure this game used to have way more darker nights, but they changed something about the saturation in a pretty early patch that also changed the illumination in night time....
---
Now the nights are so bright, it makes NV scopes pretty useless and now that i think about it darker nights could be amazing for the survival mode, making so you could sneak a lot better against other players....
---
There are rad storms in this game xD? Besides of 24/7 rain  sometimes i never saw some of these.
---
I say we go back to the fallout 4 method, save ourselves the headache 
---
I posted, asking this same question. I would love to get the pistol for my gunslinger, but she is only lvl 34
---
I was disappointed by the lack of exploration available and stuff, I would have loved being able to check it out
---
I met a immortal mirelurk king at the freak show. Name and health were not red when I was fighting all the other kings there. I got a few pictures with him before I tried killing it.
---
It's health would drop to zero but spring back up to full almost instantly. 
---
The range of berry mentats is pretty short and that guy shooting you was using a bug. In third person, shotguns have crazy range and with the right perks, pretty low spread. I was killed by one last night that was outside the range of a sniper. The quad explosive is a PITA. ;)
---
Also, berry mentats don't always work against stealth boys. I think that's also a bug.
---
This is why I haven't moved my camp in 3 months, and it will continue to sit there until this bs gets fixed (if it ever does).
---
Grafton monster behind hemlock holes can spawn bos combat armor mods. And other weapon and armor mods. It's rare but it happens 
---
Lucky hole mine
---
Most steady source:  Camp with lead deposit. 
---
Though you can go into places like Lucky Hole Mine and walk out with enough ore to craft 600+ lead.  
---
Last weekend - a pair of L68s in whitesprings - I was in the sulphur fountain gazebo when they popped out of the ground... 
---
They are tough to kill.

This post needs more upvotes.

Paint cans, weights, and I believe kids toys...

wow, great insight and info..a must read ..thanks for the hard work

Lucky hole mine with the excavator you get up to 350 lead or which melts into a lot of scrap.
---
Can i share my screens here?
---
I agree this would be a helpful addition to the UI. Here is an recipe, weapon, armor spreadsheet that lists all mods in the meantime.

Ha! Yeah i know...i set out to do the challenge thinking it would take a little while , but nothing like last week. After about a half hour i checked the challenge stat, thinking i had around 30 crits, and i already had 87

reminded me of this one  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgjKgpNzcAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgjKgpNzcAI) 
---
Excavator arms and lucky hole mine. Remember Equipping just the arms still gives the double ore extracted on nodes. So yeah, go through lucky hole and mine away!
---
If they can prevent the beer bottle and baseball from auto scraping then they should be able to do the same for anything with "bulk" in the name.
---
I feel like Jet not being in the game has more to do with slow-mo being impossible to implement effectively in multiplayer, as opposed to a lore issue.
---
If it were in the game it *would* be a lore issue but Bethesda are pretty open about not caring too much about internal consistency with smaller things like that.

WTF so you say my unique personal drop assassin explosive ultracite laser pistol ain't legacy anymore? 
---
There is zero connection between the duping and the items being with legacy status. Zero. The items that were removed in the anti-dupe-wave were not necessarily legacy, only explosive energy guns that were subsection of removed guns were the legacy ones. I now have five different legacy weapons, two different cryolators, a flamer, laser gatling and laser pistol.
---
And another incorrect sentence, no, until this is changed from the current state, players that joined the game after the patch that removed explosive from energy gun roll tables have zero chances of finding such guns if they don't get it from other players.
---
I do the same. [Someone was kind enough to make a map of all the deposits.](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-map-of-resource-deposits/)

Yeah nah I don't think there is a plan, no where with any information on the straight jacket says that it's a craftable item :/
---
Hmm, that's illuminating.  Maybe I should combine my T-60 and Excavator armor so I don't have to deal with trying to switch between the many "Power Armor Chassis" I have whenever I want to go mining.
---
Yeah, that was the joke.  :P
---
The 'Evil Dead' load out. ***Groovy***
---
I have so many screws I actually sell them in bulk to the vendors...
---
Uhoh.
---
That‚Äôs not even difficult honestly
---
nice
---
Yeah I had them from all over (I don't remember any in the ash heap, but I'm sure there were some).  I didn't expect anything from the forest, but I thought I'd get one decent item out of the pile o' maps.
---
Violins... Pfft. 
---
I want the barrel drum
---
I have rarely found them at 45%.
---
I see where you are coming from in that regard.  I'd be fine leaving the robots as is "out of box" but letting us customize the looks. Just something fun to make it more interesting than spitting out 5 assaultrons.
---
The night and day cycle goes by so quick I can just stare at shadows and watch them move. It's kind of off putting.
---
But the weathers I see are normally just sunny, cloudy, and a pathetic excuse for rain. It's so light and barely produces any noise. I want some flash flood warning rain showers.
---
Don't forget to use super duper when melting lead.
---
I don‚Äôt even have a brewing bench and never found where you do the mission lol 
---
cool I'll ping you when I'm on tonight.
---
Thanks I'll be on tonight (12 hrs from now).
---
I‚Äôm hoping I can use the one I‚Äôve kept as decoration in my lab/holding cells. Will go perfectly with the scorched heads in jars I‚Äôve collected lol.
---
Yup. That's the exact one that got me spending more than a few hours getting the upper walls juuuuuust right.
---
 About damn time they took you melee fuckers down a peg. 
---
At least you didn‚Äôt have the issue I had the other day on the Breach and Clear event. I was the only one there, showed up as it started, killed all the miners myself, had the executive ID.....not a single one of the collection chambers had any materials in them, even the executive chambers. The event ended after all 30 had 0 materials, and I got the generic event completion rewards.
---
TL;DR: breach and clear was broken for me
---
Run the beginning part of nuclear silos, you can get tons of lead from the dumbbells there, and you can go in all three silos for free after the certain quest you have to complete to gain access to them.
---
I went there, picked up a plan, and it stopped spawning. been three days now.

Insult bot told me that  if I want to make Apalacia a better place I should nuke vault 76  üò®

IGN Sgt\_OKeefe. I have what you are looking for.

The violin is an instrument with a lot of potential, you should perhaps listen to some violin concertos from Brahms, Wieniawski, Mendelssohn, Saint-Sa√´ns, or some solo work from Bach or Ysa√øe. I‚Äôd also recommend some Ligeti and Rihm !
---
Unless it's in a container that would show different for someone else like a safe...in that case take it out of that container and put in a container for someone to find at a train station.  
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it is only an xo1 mod and not available for other power armour types 
---
Mf read my mind! Throw some rockabilly or blues on a new station!
---
For me, junk runs. If you come across a tinker, bulk it up to reduce weight so you can keep junking without finding a stash.
---
Or a drop down menu on on our map so we can quickly look through currently available events and cycle through them to see location relevancy
---
Thanks so much, I‚Äôll add you right away
---
They had mentioned before release that they wanted to make private servers and we would get more news in the future.  Probably once they get a real handle on the bugs and get the regular modes running smoothly.  It's what I'm really waiting for.

Hiking through the divde last night - I noticed lots of resin on the trees between westek and atlas observatory.
---
Made me think cobalt.  
---
Firecracker berry here and there.
---
I think a few silt beans outside Atlas.
---
Long way to the nearest workbench to stablize it though....
---
Also found several iron ore veins, which I believe turn to ultracite when nuked.
---
Other than perhaps westek, didnt see much that would yield HR fluids though ... group of 4 ghouls on the RR tracks shortly after leaving pleasant valley, unnamed camp w/ 4 mole miners, another with a couple of rad toads (the slog?), a cabin that spawned a couple of molerats...and no workbenches at any of those 3.

Excavator bonus only happens if you wear the whole set I believe.

I think it's kind of fucked up the wanderer song guy sued bethesda! He wrote a good song but not like it was being used anywhere else!
---
you can sell bulked items to vendors. That is a lot of unclaimed caps in your inventory.
---
It would be awesome to have set fishing points with a random loot table. Just add in the slaughter fish from TES and we're set. Spawn meat, low level junk, skulls, random enemies and yea the mirelurk queen on a critical failure.
---
I bulked a lot of it, but I stopped because I doesn‚Äôt want to run out of plastic.
---
Thank you too.
---
Except when you get stuck in a cycle of insta dying and spawning back in the same zone
---
The time alone to compile this is worth a gold from me! Be interested to see this stuff put to data charts!
---
There is a 2-hour cooldown for each silo so you can launch up to three nukes at a time so there is no glitch
---
Paint cans with paint in them are something like *2 steel, 3 lead and 1 oil I think.  You can find them absolutely everywhere. It‚Äôs not enough on its own but it‚Äôs a good way to boost what you collect.
---
*Hopefully someone can verify this as I‚Äôm not online to check until tonight.
---
something fun and challenging would be nice. gather 40,000,000 small brown rocks quests blow. And that is what these amount to.
---
The raider camp across from Seneca rocks spawns at least two random recipes regularly.sometimes three. Theres just two high level radtoads to deal with.
---
I just make alcohol and chems to sell
---
I always do this. Love leaving piles of plans at train stations
---
Bethesda has acknowledged the issue. They report that they "need to introduce new functionality" to fix the issue while still allowing bulk to be used for crafting.
---
Here's a link to that thread:

Yes. And they could make it look like the daily challenges box on the map. So when you expand it, you see the full current status of that event. So, if a Powering Up is active, you could click the drop down and see how much total time was left as well as how far along each stage was. Ten minutes left doesn't tell you much. If the entire thing still needs done, it's not going to happen, but if there's only one stage left, then you would have no trouble finishing it. And it should allow you to turn off tracking for each event. I personally will never do Distinguished Guests again, so i should be able to turn off notifications for that. And horde events should be deactivatable per map region. I don't care about forest hordes but I'd like to know when a bog horde event happens.
---
the chainsaw, like the Mr. Handy Buzz Blade and the Ripper, when repaired to 200 percent with Weapon Artisan, WRECKS. It's only when it falls below like 150 percent repair that it starts to fade off in damage.

I always find these studies pretty interesting. You could go back and take previous studies, compile all the data, and see if you get a consistent result. 
---
Did you figure out if having a higher Luck skill effects drops at all? I know you said here that your other build was Luck 5, but you didn't mention what build you were using during the testing. I might have missed something...  
---
Was thinking of grabbing a Luck bobble-head and testing it out. I have 9 points in Luck currently, but 90% of my drops are pure garbage. 
---
I read a post not that long ago that server hopping makes a huge difference, that some servers just seem to spawn better results for some reason. 
---
So many variables to consider... but I think every time someone puts in the work like this it gets us one step closer to understanding whether or not the RNG is really RNG. 
---
I bulk and sell plastic too. Way too much of it. That might be different if I was a shotgunner, but none of my characters are.
---
those 100+ bullets are from the sentrybot's personal inventory, and normally cannot be obtained. unless you are fast enough
---
New tracks from Inon Zur would be nice too!
---
100% agree
---
I don‚Äôt have 800 caps !
---
Ooooh. I have 50, so i hadn't farmed since the patch.
---
And yeah, there is a core in the emergency services place on a shelf that spawns.
---
yes please. Seriously my most wanted item for CAMPS. After that give me an elevator and other stair Case options.
---
Indeed he does, and the delivery is hilarious
---
Please no
---
2 things, does this affect MODs that are sitting on shelfs in camp venture and in regards to picking up known stuff, does it matter? cause it seems like each loot is specific to each player
---
And I can‚Äôt hear you for some reasons
---
Once i saw 80 missiles and thought that why not i might sell them but didnt get a single one
---
What other effects do the legendaries have? The bonus  damage might be overridden by a different perk. More than once I had to change receivers on my combat rifle from single to auto and back to get the bonus damage from rifleman.

This would be awesome. But the pets you get from charisma are super lackluster, and well they don't actually do much besides hang around. I was fascinated with them for a while, decided I would make a Max charisma build and check it out. 
---
Charisma and intelligence are both stats that reach peak usefulness in only small doses unless you have a completely specialized build. And those builds have nowhere near the power of pretty much anything else you could make with the points spent elsewhere, which is disappointing. 
---
The charisma pets are pretty much just a novelty at this point, but if that ever changes I'd say add in robots for intelligence as well. 
---
Really not hard to one shot those with melee. I don't use bloodied or unyielding and I can one shot them with my insitgating axe. If you have the right perk cards you can one shot pretty much anything in this game, which is why the OP was making the point that there needs to be stronger creatures in this game, for those of us at the higher levels. 
---
It is them putting out fallout's verson of ESO and having something they can stick Bethesda austin on permanently and in theory update in perpetuity.

ESO has been going for 5 years as of this month and had a rocky start similary to Fo76. I think we can easily see at least 5 years of content for fo76.

My survival character is a chem addict. He is going to have 8 across the board S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and a mismatch of perks. Also he must take all chems he sees, and must always be under the influence.  He dies..a lot.

No it's random.  I've seen a lvl 40 Albino, a Lvl 68 (?) Alpha, a Grafton monster, glowing alpha wolfs, the bee swarm thingy, a bit of everything. Think the biggest I saw was a lvl 80 something regular deathclaw when I was lvl 45 ish.  I shot it and lead it back to the front of white springs for the bots to help kill.

Directly above the bed and breakfast by Charlie is a scenic overlook with lots of flat cement ground and stairs.
---
Oh Canadaaaaa

But only Lead and Aluminum.  Nothing else gains a weight reduction from bulking.

Always use the Green Thumb perk when flux farming and Super Duper when crafting.  And don't forget to grab hardened masses and rations fluids from corpes laying about.
---
Thank you very much

Running from a deathclaw and you're suggesting he build his house there?  That's just evil.

Oh yes super duper as well ! Thanks for the tips !

You whine like a mule Christian. If you are bored take a break. 
---
I loved having my own sentry bot companion. 100% would have one again if for no other reason than to carry junk.
---
I like this. Make them one-off and extremely rare so finding a new song is a huge thing, and it improves the game for everyone.
---
Maybe a nice unique legendary reward for turning it in. People ignore recordings anyway, so those of us that stop and listen to every new one would be the winners here. And more people would listen to the lore tapes too.
---
Just in a prosses on making a Pistol build and its been nice and refreshing since i hardly use them in any other build

Yes it‚Äôs what I need !

Don‚Äôt move your camp node once you place it down

Damn.   I‚Äôm running low on 5.56 as I‚Äôm using more than I‚Äôm picking up when hitting super mutants.   Mind you, even if it‚Äôs only 100 max then I guess I still might have a go.

Is there a source on that?

Whenever there is a server maintenance, I watch this subreddit and when some posts the servers are up (which usually happens before the Bethesda announcement) I login and fast travel to the gyms like (Flatwoods, Charleston, etc...) and then server hop to do it again.
---
Did it yesterday about 3 times. :)
---
First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to respond with such a post.  I read through all of the material and the game FINALLY makes some sense
---
I do play on pc, and already found your twitch.  In FO76 I am beverly_hillbilly.  Most of my available gaming time is on the weekends, but I watch people stream whenever in the evenings.
---
Again, thank you so much for helping 
---
There are pretty consistent armor plans there as well, at least last time I checked.
---
You can find a note get a kick ass space suit.

How do you farm the sentry bots? I tried to do that once but it‚Äôs inventory disappeared before I could grab anything. Same goes for all the robots
---
I'll try to finish putting together my list of items. I have like 300+ items stored on an alternate mule account I made, so I have a fairly unbiased set of drops I can tally up.
---
The only legendary items I carry consistently are a bloodied grognak axe and an anti-armor sledgehammer. I basically just farm until I fill up my carry capacity, then off-load them to the mules, so any influence the items would have is only effective for short-ish bursts of farming.
---
Nah you posted this right. These atom dailies aren't a must do but doing them at all has become so damn annoying i do one weekly and a daily or 2 anymore. The whopping 2 new events have been nice but one ended after a week and the other fills 10 minutes of your day up. Say you play 2-4 hours a day. 120-240 minutes. Most of that time for me is just farming atoms or farming matts to vend for the shitty caps system. Why? Because im the idiot paying 960 caps a pattern at whitesprings. Limited building choices so for variety i try to get all the patterns.
---
I just really want a big spring I can jump on to and it launch my ass in a random direction.
---
&gt; You could go back and take previous studies, compile all the data, and see if you get a consistent result. 
---
My previous build got tainted (has team drops which resulted in whacky drops then on). This build is way better controlled for factors.
---
&gt; Luck skill effects drops at all 
---
Luck affects the quality bar length for sure. Maybe it can boost the chance a 3\* enemy spawns, but I have no way of testing that. It would be quite tiresome and lengthy to get multiple characters to various luck levels, then run them at the locations long enough to get a good dataset. Plus, do that with as less interference from other players as well.
---
&gt; I read a post not that long ago that server hopping makes a huge difference, that some servers just seem to spawn better results for some reason. 
---
I have not tried deliberately jumping servers. At best I can get 30-80 drops per server, which is too low given the item and effect pool size. Also one would have to control for the items in inventory/stash between jumps.
---
I have them now !
---
Please make rad storms persist for at least an hour and have a big bad thing in the middle. Let them be like a small nuke event. Also, if rad storm is hit with an actual nuke, the big bad thing should be the biggest and the worst thing in the middle.  
---
Please make dark periods much more common. It now feels like nocturnal only works 25% of the time. Its worthless anyway as it is, but the encounters are kinda scarier when you see nothing.  
---
Make the ash heap throw out a big range uglifcaton event that shrouds it all with smoke and ash so your visibility is ten meters. Make something lurk there in the the smoke, waiting for you to wander away from your group.

And fix the big quests. Stuck on sneak attacks for like four days. Giving up on the whole thing.

I'm on PC. YMMV for how players behave in your local regional servers + playtimes. Most of the time I'm the one running the missile silos myself, but on occasion I see others do it. 
---
She used to be buffed based on # of players, but I think that's actually mostly due to previous lag (preventing damage from processing onto her). They've since optimized / fixed most of that. She goes down quickly with multiple heavy gun users shooting her.  It is mostly a matter of making her land-- by being in valid landing spots.
---
I'm not bored with the game. Just the dailies. Which is the only way to earn Atoms.
---
We need to upvote this post or you should repost it and get Bethesda‚Äôs attention on it. (I googled my bugged challenge and found your post) I too would like a fix! 
---
I've had more problems with the Gulpers and fog crawlers then deathclaws.

It was a phase when season 3 came out, ok?
---
nope, unless their is an aid item adds a temp bonus
---
Idk that ine works perfectly well for me.
---
When the game was like 25ish on sale I got a copy for my buddy and told him he didn't have to pay me back if he didn't like it...he paid me back a week later
---
Melee was ruined in the last patch. It‚Äôs really hard to compete in PVP with these issues 
---
I'm not saying the loss is a bad thing, but currently it seems like you're losing too much which is unjustified because of the poor combat mechanics.
---
But with the current setup for survival, there is no fight for resources at all, it's whatever people are stupid enough to be carrying around with them. Resources which can be gained just as normal in the adventure mode. I agree, factions would be a good addition to survival, just going around with a target on your head for not dying isn't exactly fun. There's no other purpose in it at the moment. 
---
It‚Äôs for future reference, your camp is unplaceable now, when you put it down in the future don‚Äôt move the camp node. That‚Äôs why it happens.
---
The raider cabins/camps at the Top of the World are great plan spawn areas. Camden park is also good.
---
This great video actually has a ton of plan spawn areas that I followed: https://youtu.be/diJLAwFAaUA
---
It's in Big Al's Tattoo parlour just behind VTU.
---
Yes, it is a pain in the butt to get cryolater ammunition. That's very likely what happened, and cryolaters still break fairly quickly as well. Getting a dedicated freeze player is very rare, because of how uncommon cryo ammo is and how unlikely it is for a player to make cryo ammo in large numbers, and to have multiple cryolaters.
---
However, it is extremely effective-- just costly. Stagger perks are a lot more cost efficient, and shotguns / heaven weapons a lot more common so most people use those.
---
Sry don't think this guys exist in our Universe :( Only good ol Agatha with her Soil Stradivarius and a Radio Station.

---
Well, dinner would be interesting for at least one of you.
---
You are you saying once I place the node itself, don‚Äôt move it around within the camp?
---
Or are you saying, once I place the camp somewhere, just leave the entire camp at that spot?
---
Nice

I maxed out on the crafting perks so I can repair to 200% and mod whatever I want, then I got quality of life perks.

---
same issue - no help so far.
---
Seriously I get excited after dropping a sentry bot as sometimes it shows 300 to 400 ammo but it vanishes...they aint that easier kill so this should be part of the reward..
---
!!! I wasn't patient enough, apparently
---
Oooo good idea. I have been stashing anything weightless or lighter but have not tried modding weight.
---
I sent a key to my friend who is an old fogey original Fallout nut like me. We play almost daily, and have since about 2 weeks after release.
---
I sent a key to my daughter, who loves New Vegas like a religion. I need to find another friend to send a slightly used account to.
---
100% amazing idea
---
Yes, more flexibility would be fantastic. I would love to be able to place angled walls or set up junkier quick builds around the map. Though I bet it is mostly because the devs don't want game breaking/exploitive designs in CAMPs (well more than you can do already). They'd probably have to make floors destructible or something or something. That way NPCs (or hostile players) would be able to still attack your base as designed.
---
Go to Charlseton fire dept and collect all the weights there and scrap them on the bench there. Usually get 75 to 85 lead. There are weights in all the silos as well on the first floor when you go in. Deal with the robots collect the weights and leave. There are benches outside of silos B and C. Silo A is a short walk to pleasant valley station.
---
I have been told by several players that they got PA armor plans from Cranberry Bog &amp; Savage Divide, I've gotten several T-45 &amp; T-51 plans, but never any T-60, I do get a lot of plans though, CBB=70%, SD= 50%, Mire= 30%
---
i guess that is why i got 3 weightless armor in a row, i had 11 in my stash box before i got them
---
Definitely.
---
Anecdotally, when I play in a team, we all seem to get a disproportionate number of items with the same prefix. In one queen fight and random legendary runs, over 2/3 of the items were Mutants. I have to believe the servers have a predetermined designation list.  The program limits the main designation on each server. If you start getting a bunch of Bloodied items, I would milk that server and see if that designation keeps dropping. 
---
Insects chirping my guy. When you hear the cricket chirping canned noise that's your audio indicator that nighttime's  a' comin'.
---
You'd get more caps selling the raw ingredients used to make the alcohol. Pretty sure that goes for chems as well.
---
My unarmed character would kill for that leg. Or give a leg if you will. I've read luck plays a roll in quality drops but who knows?
---
Each train station has a bulletin board inside with a poster inviting you to a frat party. Read it and you'll get a quest.

---
I‚Äôd rather have new stuff in the shop instead of old cycled stuff. They‚Äôll definitely get more $ out of me with the new stuff. I play other games that cycle the shops and it‚Äôs so annoying seeing the same things come up over and over again. 
---
Thanks so much for making this. This is amazingly informative and, it must have taken some time to make.
---
The first thing you said is correct.
---
Beth could lock the perks cards from being removed if removing them would exceed the stash limit.  Give you a message that you need to reduce your stash weight first.
---
Not if you build your camp near one! Worst. Neighbor. Ever.
---
I NEED this for uranium fever.
---
In addition to what‚Äôs been said, Pick up all the pencils you see. It‚Äôs only 1 lead but it‚Äôs light and shows up in different environments than paint cans, ore, etc.  so the hunt doesn‚Äôt have to die just because you are in an office building.
---
Well fuck me....lol guess I‚Äôll spend another 4 hours tonight and not touch the damn thing ever again 
---
Awesome write up, in your opinion if I wanted to just farm one spot over and over by server hopping killing the enemy repeat what would be the best location.
---
Be careful not to scrap by accident lol
---
This isn‚Äôt always true. I‚Äôve moved my node around my camp a bunch of times and it‚Äôs still there. 
---
I was keeping 3* for a long time (I dont use melee). I kept getting melee drops. I tossed every melee piece but one and I rarely get melee drops anymore. Not that this is evidence but this thread confirms what I was thinking was happening!
---
I appreciate the data collection and it's good of you to share your findings, but I have to question your conclusions. 
---
You don't have enough data to rule out a uniform distribution. To the contrary, the data you've shared is consistent with a uniform distribution. True random effects have streaks. Mean values are unlikely to converge on expected mean values over 142 events when you have a categorical variable with 48 possibilities.   
---
I'd love to test your hypothesis about inventory-modified-RNG, but this sample is far too small to be powered to detect that. 
---
Aluminum, Copper, Cork, Fertilizer, Gears, Lead, Oil, and Springs.
---
Remember, this is in inventory while junking. Not in the stash.
---
Good to know
---
Yeah, I'm always extremely careful when scrapping.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
You could probably make more money selling it to other players. Or even better, make shotgun ammo and sell it.
---
I miss my assaultron  based off Roberto from Futurama. 
---
Regarding the deep pocketed raider chest mod you found there... has anyone else noticed that it only gives +10 to carry while the regular pocketed gives +15? 
---
I would tame a Liberator. Just to hear it chatter at me.
---
"Though an option would probably needed to be added for non-power armor users."
---
So you mean the Pip-boy light everyone forgets about? 
---
I do this all the time.  I'll have a bunch of bulk ready to sell.  I'll forget about it like 2 seconds later and scrap all after picking up some items.  For me, it's not the plastic waste that makes me mad even though it does suck a lot.  It's the time and caps I have to spend to find a tinkerers bench and bulk everything again.  Especially now that everyone within ear shot has to listen to me tinkering. 
---
who is insult bot? ive never seen that robot before, and i have played for 320 hours, if that matters
---
Thanks for the tip, but I worry about the time I spend indoors. 
---
That's the problem. You have to be really lucky to find someone who doesn't know the value of good armors or weapons and be the first one that contacts him.  
---
If you want any Sentinel/Cavalier/Assassin set, or BE, AAE or TSE weapon, you already need to have something   
---
good to trade.  
---
When the game launched there was a huge number of people duping, so everything was cheap and people was selling for caps, not anymore.  
---
Doesn't it already work on the number keys?  (I'm leaving this voice to text crap here: does he already work on Lamborghinis?)
---
I would be 100% ok with that. The money is everywhere and has little to no use right now. Cloth is abundant elsewhere. So this would give some substantial meaning to pre-war money. Provided they also turn off the auto-scrap function on it. I can only imagine hoarding it just to accidentally scrap it.
---
thank you
---
Harpers Ferry area is one of these places as well. It's complicated to explain how to do it, but I'll try:  
---
Start at the Hermit Crab, kill him. There is a safe in the trailer behind him, that spawns a plan every once in awhile. Kill everything in Harpers Ferry, get 3-4 legendary weapons, always a slim chance for a 3\* weapon or armor. (1 in 10 tries gets a 3\* weapon or armor)  
---
The level 3 safe by the Harpers Ferry vendor sometimes spawns plans. In the area where the turrets are, every once in awhile you can find a rare recipe to the left on the top of the roof where a skeleton is sitting and watching the fireworks.   
---
You can find rare plans for armor modifications, typically two of them, in the little chapel / church thing on the hill up the steps. Don't worry about that turret...it doesn't shoot very often. It's slow to target you, slow to react, and blah.   
---
You can also usually find a rare mod on the table next to the weapons workbench as well. You're finished in this specific spot.  
---
Then go to power station up the hill. You'll usually find gulpers, anglers, ants, bloatflys, and bloodbugs. 2/10 times a legendary gulper will spawn. Always take disease cures because the gulpers are almost ALWAYS diseased.  
---
Then, once you are done there....go back towards Harpers Ferry, cross the bridge where the giant crab was, cross the little bridge that sits in the water (that spot is where my CAMP always is btw lol) and go up the hill in the divide. When you get up the hill, either a deathclaw, a sentry bot, or a gaggle of super mutants will spawn. Sometimes all 3. 1/10 chance one of them is legendary. Sometimes ALL THREE can be legendary. Kill them.  
---
Keep going up the hill, you'll see a rock formation at 11 o'clock, go over there. Kill the super mutants that guard it (if any) and scavenge around there. You can find some plans there too sometimes. 
---
This is how it should work imo. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to run around in a fresh mushroom cloud without power armor. That just seems silly. 
---
Youll get banned for scamming people
---
Today I gathered six new plans. Two I bought from that random vendor bot spawn with the brahmin, the rest from random creatures such as a diseased bloated glowing feral (a set of lights for camp which was so cool) and the others from equally random encounters. I just play, rarely server hop and my luck is only at 4. I'm lvl 113 and today was my most profitable. It seemed every third creature was legendary and I now have an assortment of Bloodied, Furious 3star weapons and armour.  Mostly Whitesprings. 
---
This thread is definatly usefull but I cant help but think I have more fun just playing than watching loading screens. 
---
Just go to Eastern Regional Penitentiary and disarm the 6 tincan traps inside. Each trap has 9 cans. Each can gives 2 steel and 1 lead. So that‚Äôs 118 Steel and 54 lead in like 2. Server hop and repeat.
---
Maybe. Still, I remember in Destiny 2 people asked for months for a feature to multi-delete Shaders (small stackable items you use to colour armor), because deleting them one at a time was a pain in the ass, and *how hard could it possibly be?*.
---
Well, at one point a developer posted an explanation of how many different systems that simple thing touched, and the possible implications, gotchas and edge cases. They eventually implemented it, but via an NPC who does it for you.
---
I think it would have been perhaps relatively simple to implement if designed that way from the beginning, but it may not be easy to shoehorn into the current system. **Or maybe it is**, I‚Äôm just saying we can‚Äôt assume it. 
---
You are three months late to any relevancy here m8.
---
Didn't you get the option to pick another server?
---
Agreed 
---
I drop shotgun ammo by the hundredss just from looting scorched as I wander. Usually in blue suitcases. .38 as well. Maybe I will open an ammo shop when vendors are a thing. 
---
I wish I could scrap ammo so I could use the lead. I go through a lot of .45 since an auto combat rifle is may ranged spray-and-pray to bring down bots or scorchbeasts so I can whack em proper.
---
Codsworth was my tank, I miss him
---
Steel: Helvetia or the Feed The People quest at Mama Dolce's. 
---
They should get the nuka cola door in for your camps so you can place it down and it opens up to a man cave. That would be awesome 
---
Yeah I can see the blatant hypocrisy of my comments it's all part of this whole thread of trolling you lol.  It wasn't obvious when I said "native American like Elizabeth Warren" ? Lolllll
---
What would you sell 50 cal for?
---
3 siles 
---
 fire station 
---
flatwoods
---
horwright estate
---
Whack. 
---
Nope, said an update made it so the camp couldn‚Äôt be placed and that was that 
---
It's one of the rarest drops in them game I believe. When you complete any mire or free states event there's a 0.02% chance of dropping. 
---
Looking to trade not sell 
---
Excellent work my friend.
---
But query: On your 2\* and 3\* weapons and armor did you make any not on the distribution of secondary and tertiary attributes? 
---
Thanks and I'll take my question off the air.
---
Just outside of Charleston station there is a small chance a bot will spawn, this bot sells the coat for 700 caps. Your best bet is when the robot is found, have someone wait with it, preferably a friend then server hop on and off till the bot's inventory shows the coat. It's tedious yet effective
---
I'd love longer rain and heavier thunderstorms.  The rain is so peaceful for me in game.  The thunderstorms would make it so much more scarier running into a Cryptid or other larger creature.
---
I can imagine an almost pitch black night. You're strolling through the woods and lightning strikes.  It outlines a deathclaw that roars to life.  It'd be heart pounding.  Bonus points if the music and sound effects, other than the storm, go silent as you approach the area.
---
Yeah, let's make them even more useless. 
---
You can always server hop.
---
In the shadow of the Valley, I would like to settle down..
---
Close it &amp; restart.
---
Panic!  Radaway! Stimpack!  Hazmat!  Fast Travel!  Overloaded!  Die!
---
I thought the prefixes were stuck on certain servers. It seems that when the enemies usually have a few items or certain prefixes that they drop more of on each server. 
---
In one day I found 2 explosive weapons and a TSE. I've never found explosive weapon. I've also noticed this with the vangaurds and unyeilding prefixes. As you said, it could be just because I'm picking them up consistently that they keep dropping
---
Found the stash on the floor by the door once.
---
My advice is to level to 50 by exploring and killing mobs around the map and then start doing the quests. Some of the unique quest rewards are pretty decent and will be useless to you going forward if you earn them at a low level.
---
Ah cool. Thanks.
---
i'm still trying to find a way to make that damn hopper booze so ...
---
Did you keep those items the whole time?
---
I have a [table for per-server legendary effects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1199519143). Perhaps the latest server, 1053, has something to tell. 7 Mutant Slayer's is a lot and I got 4 in a quick succession, even though I did not pick any of them up. A factor could be that it was in a nuke zone and there were other players hitting the same Glowing ones.
---
There could be some streak effects going on: the game decides to drop the same item with different effects or the same effects on different items in a quick succession. That would require a more complicated analysis not really possible with pivot tables in their current form.
---
I did this yesterday, bulked close to 1000 iron, and fucking scrapped them all. I think bulk should be treated as baseball (ball) is, it wont scrap by itself when you press scrap all, you need to manually scrap it.
---
I dig it. I made an alt character specifically for this expansion. My fermenter is in a shed behind my camp. I just wish i could bulk down my beer into six packs and liquor into cases of 12 for the sake of weight management 
---
You only need charisma to get the relevant perk...3
---
Gt Plausible Whale, i can walk you through
---
Oh god. Make it so that the Ash heap is completely covered by thick smog, but its so heavy it falls down rapidly, so the higher you are the further your view distance.
---
Definitely sell that shotgun ammo. 38 and 10mm as well as the heavy stuff is good to give away though. Not much demand.
---
If you loot the weights in the hotel by flatwoods and the penitentiary as well as all the hanging can traps, you can get tons of lead quick and easy. Another option is to loot lucky hole mine. You'll will have more lead than you will know what to do with, especially if you use the excavator power armor.
---
Max your Luck, take both. Find yourself a weapon with either +crit damage OR +crit acc, AND +crit refill. Pew, pew.
---
If you are fine with 1\*, which I'd love to get a Ghoul Slayer's and a Mutant slayer's Handmade, Whitesprings is pretty good. For 2-3\*, I'd go for Watoga and Harper's Ferry.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
In my opinion, there should be an alternativ to the PA.
---
Maybe upgradable hazmat suit.
---
Or I dont mind if you can get it with a combination of perks, armor with lead, alcohol and meds.
---
I hatte fa67 for the fact, everything is build around PA gameplay.
---
We already had this in all precious games, boring. 
---
Also, make sure you aren't overencumbered when you do the first part of that quest. You'll soon see why and thank me later. Have fun!
---
&gt; This, my friend. Is what random is. It does not mean evenly distributed. A common fallacy.
---
I know that's what random is, hence my complaint about, you know... random number generation?  As in the title of this post?  I don't know what the hell you mean by saying that it is a common fallacy. 
---
I understand perfectly what it means. 
---
My point is that it needs to stop. 
---
I found one just the other day on xbox at a clothing store in I think Berkley springs on a selling pedestal near a broken window. Had like 3 things on display
---
\*taps forehead\* Can't farm caps from you if you don't have any caps
---
I think the behavior you notice is that you have harvested that plant within the past 24 hours. If you switch servers then the plants are regrown but you cannot pick them.
---
For a while I had my base nearby the chemical plant and would periodically walk up and down the river north of harpers and find them
---
I‚Äôll help you on one condition. I would require payment for my services. I request the following items:
---
1 x Tin Can
---
1 x Toothbrush
---
3 x 10mm round
---
1 x Jangles The Moon Monkey
---
And to round it all off, 6 bottle caps.
---
These are my terms, please consider my offer.
---
Interesting correlation. Now the proactive thing would be to keep stashing the thing you do want and see if that increases your drop chances.
---
I run a bloodied build. The questions were really literal. I see a lot of posts pointing out damage without ever specifying what they're using with it. I've even had people ask me on fallout market what the damage was on a weapon before they buy it. Lol. There's so many factors involved in the damage on a weapon that a snapshot just doesn't really cut it. 
---
I got it but I just wish there was more you know, it was such a unique environment 
---
Only tse I had drop in this game was a .44 and pre nerf you didn't even have to use any of the damage cards for it. Lmao. 
---
The one up north by the crashed space station doesn't ever have good plans (for me) but is an excellent source of scrapping items and there are usually lead veins around the crash site. It's also one of the two maps I find most often while out adventuring, along with one of the Cranberry Bog ones I haven't ventured out to use yet.
---
The area north of Grafton is actually pretty good for lower levels (15-25) looking for cryptids and legendary creatures. I run into the Grafton monster and packs of Wendigos every time, plus some decently outfitted glowing ghouls. 
---
As a newb, I would really like events to have a few words description, or some difficulty level grading.  Especially when I can't stop and look it up.  
---
But that is probably just me.  
---
I received a mutant from a tech data drop right as the nuke was falling. I fast travelled to the queen fight and received 3 more mutant items. Two from legendary adds and two from the queen. Either the server limits the first level designation or it gets stuck. All four were armor. Combat, metal, robot and wood. My teammates received a mutant board and two other pieces of mutant armor. That seems like a ridiculously low probability of all of us receiving the same designation in rapid succession. 
---
Please dont. I like seeing past 5 feet...
---
Or since greyed out usually means you don‚Äôt have the supplies or rank to craft something, have [Unknown] in front of plans we don‚Äôt have. Sort of opposite of how they have Known in front of plans we already have.
---
Anything to give some clue about what we still have to find or unlock would be nice.
---
Cheers, I just wish I had realised this earlier ha, if you have duplicates of a card that don‚Äôt rank up can you trade them with other players in game, at what level do you stop getting cards or Special points are or does it just keep going 
---
You mean the one that shoots cannonballs, the broadsider? It‚Äôs not great sadly :( you need to try for direct impact shots since the AoE is tiny. It‚Äôs there, but it‚Äôs not enough to just shoot at the ground near enemies. 
---
I had an anti armor one that was decent. Not amazing or efficient by any means but was fun and usable. Just got a two shot one that seems alright too
---
See this pisses me off. When they nerfed the tse weapons my lever action went from 488 to 205 and I have all the rifle cards maxed, and the demolition expert card maxed as well. Now my anti armor dragon is the most damage I can deal out at 360. 
---
I made this change maybe 10 days ago and I have received more ranged weapons than I previously had. I used to primarily grind White Springs but for the last 4 days I‚Äôve been grinding West Tek. 
---
I use mismatched armor and I receive all armor types. When I previously had only CA I was getting a lot of 1* CA.
---
Thanks for the kind words. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed; feel free to share as you see fit üòÅ
---
An hours worth of work for that gun still doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to me haha. I hope they make more interesting rewards for future weeks. I think the only one I want is the action hero?
---
...does that mean it was enjoyable lol?
---
If so, thanks! üòÅ
---
Is that the 50 cal? Yeah that‚Äôs the only one I want, but this was an easy earn, especially compared to last week 
---

Wow seems that SBQ finally is finally a Challenge and not a spamfest anymore, hope this happens more. would be fun.

Xbox gamertag: Explozive Force
---
Yes, that's a space, and explosive has a "z" in it. Send me a message and I can hook you up. 
---
Really??
---
This happened to me once. I think the servers stop auto loading people in after a certain amount of time. Almost as if they are on a cycle or something? That‚Äôs a good opportunity to post and have some fun pvp hahaha 
---
Cool , ty.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the 50 cal. Been wanting to do a heavy weapons build. 
---
I've called you for what you are all along... Go sit back under your bridge... Troll. See you you in survival mode sweetheart üñï
---
Loololoool
---
good tips. thanks!
---
Ive seen this before as well.  I love the intensity of those battles. Kill and loot them immediately.
---
You can join my cult.
---
You can‚Äôt control disconnects 
---
this is intended. you are able to use the power station to power your base. you can build a camp at any of them.
---
Next time that happens invite me so I can grind with that tasty xp bonus haha. 
---
Cycling old items back into the store does not prevent or interfere with new content in any way. The shop should have both, as there is very little content anyway.
---
I cannot spend money indiscriminately at all times, and I'm guessing that I'm not alone in that. I just got some extra money, but right now there is not a single item on the Atom store that I want; however, there are some retired items that I wish I could buy.
---
They must have this marketing department mentality that that people will buy more of things are available for a limited time (just like late night TV commercials). I will buy things when I can, not because they create an artificial deadline.
---
It ignores the reality that some people have to be selective about how they use disposable income, and cosmetic microtransactions are rarely going to be a priority.
---
that seems to be exactly how it works. eventually the server will tell u it‚Äôs going down in 20 minutes. they seem to last around 12 hours.
---
How much charisma do you need for a pet actually?
---
Sooo, you were the "sole survivor" of vault 76? :)
---
Most of the players were dead in the first firing of the gamma gun. It was ridiculous. I get the challenge part, but I had a hazmat on to stop the rads from it, which did nothing. 
---
Fishing at different areas could have different chances and pulling up different junk/loot 
---
There could be, but since I have very few 2-3\* compared to the sheer number of 1\*, I don't draw a conclusion for them yet. The same pattern might be true for the Major and Minor effects. I have tables for that:
---
[Major distribution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1292480813)
---
[Minor distribution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=2120371463)
---
I'm definitely stashing Explosives and 90% weight reduced items. I'd attribute the current dominant factors to streaks or short-term inventory effects (not stashed).
---
That's pretty steep given how valuable Jangles is.  
---
&gt;Stash/hold items with the desired type or legendary effect.
---
Example: want Assault Rifles: stash excess rifles
---
Example: want Bloodied weapons: stash bloodied weapons
---
if this was true, then i would not be getting wood and leather armor pieces
---
This
---
I agree with making them tougher, but the frequency seems OK to me. I usually see one level appropriate deathclaw about every 3 hours, in my wanderings around the waste.  (lvl 52 on PC and lvl72 on xbox).
---
I had one scare the !@#$ out of me just north of watoga. It was level 65 ish and i was lvl50 on PC. It came busting out of a power substation and coming at me like i owed it money.
---
I like the idea of deathclaw pairs or packs. I think it could be a way of making the wasteland more fun.
---
I wish we could have Ghillie suits instead
---
So another thing what you can do is move the node before you build anything, because idk if you are aware but moving the node changes your spawn location. You spawn to the east of your camp node.
---
If it spawns you in a place the game seems unspawnable that 76 message will pop up.
---
If you want the node out of sight move it around and relog before you start building to see if your camp is there on the next login.
---
It‚Äôs bullshit and it happened to me as well, just trying to keep people informed.
---
Yeah I think four leaf clover is better for a slower fire rate
---
Badum tiss ha! Well if you're on xbox and have an unyielding sentinel bos right leg or chest, then it's yours üëç 
---
Crowd control, you need it.
---
Thanks!! I‚Äôll add you when I get on later tonight!!
---
I‚Äôm not cheap, I‚Äôm the ‚ÄòTunnel Master‚Äô I‚Äôve been inside tunnels so deep and dark and wet that if, any other man were to venture to, would simply die of fear. 
---
It really appears you don‚Äôt understand what a Civil War re-enactment is buddy.
---
After playing 200 hours i hardly learn any mods anymore.  When i  scrap its mainly because of the materials to make ammo.  But still a good idea
---
I do like NPC interaction, especially when done well (like New Vegas and the original fallouts where what you said to the NPCs mattered. Hell even 3 was better for that than 4). But I also think that no NPCs in an MP game actually is better cause I don't see everyone gathering to the same NPC knowing he's telling them the same thing, it's a big reason I can't really feel I'm part of some story in an MMO cause that breaks my immersion. Granted with Fallout there is a lot less density of players (which I absolutely love) but still, if there is a very popular one it's going to suck seeing everyone go talk to it at the same time.
---
Bobble heads and magazines: docks at dried up lake
---
The Alien Space Blaster isn't far from there, but you're right there should be a lot more cool stuff in that area.
---
Yes the shop should have both but that‚Äôs not how this one seems to work. As of now it seems they can only put a certain amount of stuff in it or something? Either way while the pool of available stuff in the shop is so small I‚Äôd rather have new stuff. If the shop was bigger? Sure! Throw it all in there haha. 
---
The golf house no longer respawns all the ghouls every time someone joins the server, so there are much better places to farm. And there are also several other places camps can be built to farm exp like this. 
---
I would say you need to be more creative and go level somewhere else instead of server hopping the same location over and over again. At this point I would view your constant server hopping as more of a game detriment than someone‚Äôs turret base.
---
LOL
---
There's a destroyed one in Welch that usually has a core and 70+ rounds of 5.56 (depends though; sometimes it's .38). I think you can server hop to have it reset, although I haven't tried it. Apparently (according to some youtuber) the catch is that you have to avoid any combat in the town to have it load with ammo properly (again, I haven't tried it). You just kill the mole rats on the tracks and cut down to where it sits demolished on the road.
---
Maybe it didn't take long for people to figure out how broken PVP is in this game so people are staying away? 
---
exactly. it's pretty disheartening to be a casual player in games and get content locked away and possibly never see because you have life priorities  that come first. 
---
the logical conclusion is spend money, right? yeah, no. I will never justify dropping more money on cosmetics than I'd pay on an entire game so I guess I just won't get the atom stuff since at the price point right now it is far too expensive for long term buying. (or even a short term splurge unless it's a sale)
---
for example if it was what i would pay for a monthly sub fee? sure! but the price of a brand new game on a monthly basis or more? that is not something I will prioritize in my budget. 
---
and before someone comments at how they just throw atoms at you, that's not true. unless I'm missing something doing dailies has yielded me 100 atoms a day if im being generous (and most people are unable to do every daily every day anyway)... but 100 atoms a day means you can buy a floor tile after almost a week? is that throwing atoms at you in the grander scheme of things?
---
I'd like to see these things rotate out AND get new content. it doesn't have to be mutual exclusive. it absolutely does NOTHING to keep all the old assets available for purchase. they are dangled on sale before retirement to manipulate purchases. I guess it's not as bad as a "grab this 24 hour sale rare item never see again" purchase...
---
anyway. it doesn't make me feel like I'm happy and treated as a valued customer when practices like this are used. and if no one ever voices their concerns no one will ever know right? im just waiting for a gaming company to listen to their entire fanbase ...
---
You‚Äôre correct. It isn‚Äôt ALWAYS true, but every time I‚Äôve tried to replicate it I‚Äôve been able to. And I‚Äôm still built in the same spot even after the 76 update message appeared cause I rebuilt, I didn‚Äôt move the camp and it was fine.
---
Moved the camp and poof, gone.
---
That would be awesome.
---
You know what else is 50s roller derby.
---
I'd love to see a pack of costumed  ghouls on skates.
---
I agree with your reply about the rad storms, they really add to the whole apocalyptic theme.  One could even make the case that they are highly responsible for the inevitable death of all the foliage to come, but if they were more frequent and lasted longer, then the inevitable whining to get rid of them would start
---
I'm hoping someone will clarify. What exactly happens if you move the CAMP module after initial placement? I usually put it inside my CAMP building or at least on the foundation that holds the stairs to the entrance. Thanks
---
Pretty sure it's intentional you need power armor or a hazmat suit to go into nuke zones. I'll save my normal armor for the vault raids. 
---
We all get Wood and Drills. This does not mean you'll now always get Assault Rifles and Bloodied weapons. It implies you should see disproportionately more Assault Rifles or Bloodied weapons then on, across several dozen drops.
---
Thanks for testing this. A couple questions and observations:
---
\-Are you spending a lot of time farming the same server each session? I seem to notice that a server will tend to drop a lot of the same effects. This also seems to extend to the technical data rewards as well. And it seems to be independent of player. For example, I got a scribe outfit from a technical data turn in and 2 vendors I went to on that same server had one in their inventory. That means 2 other people also got it and sold it. Same for all the prefixes. When I sell my excess legendaries, I see a lot of other items in vendor inventory with the same prefixes. So maybe this gives weight to the idea that the RNG is seeded and each server has a different seed. As a further experiment, maybe server hop after every area you clear.
---
\-Stashed and equipped items have 0 effect on my drops. I hoard chameleon, weightless, and all legendary rifles. However, I almost never get those to drop. Every piece of chameleon I own I bought from a vendor. I typically only get melee weapons and armor with the worst prefixes (the top 5 most common prefixes of your armor drops). And I've only ever received 2 legendary rifles period. One handmade and one hunting. 
---
\-My armor prefix and melee prefix drop rates match yours. My ranged occurrences doesn't even come close to yours. I can't remember the last time I've gotten an assault rifle, submachine gun, handmade, railroad, or broadsider.
---
Bethesda: It was a phase when the Nuka Shine DLC came out, ok?
---
&gt;  Radiation resistance on nuked zones outside of Hazmat and Power Armor does little 
---
That's why Power armor and hazmat suits are in the game.  So maybe you should consider putting one on before going into a high rad zone? 
---
I snipe the whitesping ones and remain neutral to the other robots...still dont get the ammo!
---
I truly just want to upgrade my armor but obviously upgrading my inventory would be nice as well! Sorry for not posting my platform at first
---
I have never gotten a drill. but great job on the break down
---
Bolton Greens Distinguished Guests. I do it every single time I see it. It‚Äôs a lot of fun to me for some reason. I also enjoy the messenger. A flag system would be awesome. 
---
Being put in a random location of the map and no fast travel
---
Yea. I think it could have been cool to say maybe the station just happened to crash into a facility and exposed a bunker for exploration. Maybe even a space related one, maybe it was purposely brought down there or something
---
Had that happen to me at the Watoga power station last night with around 1/4th of the Deathclaws that spawned there over a few hours. They would stare at me until i got close and when i smacked them with my super sledge they would just try to kite me around the outside fence lol. 
---
For the LOVE OF GOD yes! The beta had more tunes than the game. WTF.
---
Darker nights is a big no for me. It was that way at launch and it wasn't enjoyable at all.
---
Heavy weapons got buffed recently.  I'm actually considering making one since that machine gun is kinda fun now.
---
I apologize for my country's lack of Canadian respect.

I look forward to my kind and patient Canadian overlords.

What happens when you are riddled with everything literally 800lbs of weapons 
---
How deep into the mine does one have to go? I'm level 34, non-melee build, and the thought of fighting off a ton of cave crickets sounds kind of awful. 
---
&gt;Why not gift a copy of the game to a friend or family member  
---
Because its expensive
---
Rick Sanchez rules! Be proud of your name, you booze guzzling, pants soiling, hoover nosed genius!

Sorry, that's what I get for repyling in my inbox. Thought this was a reply to a different post. Ignore.
---
That's also where I hide my excess I cant sell. So anyone who follows me can find it. But the safe wont hold much so check the other containers.
---
Not that specifically, but I find that when I have bugged quests like that I can usually clear it out by fast-traveling a couple of times. 
---
Thanks for stopping by! Come join us tonight!
---
Oh God yes
---
I farm Site Prime/ Glassed Cavern every few days for fiber optics, springs, gears, steel, and Digestive Goo/adhesive.
---
Fiber optics from the 6 lootable dead fog crawlers in the Cavern.
---
Springs from the 2 dead bears near the fissure site that's not prime.
---
Gears from the lootable dead Mirelurk Queen in the Cavern, the dead deathclaw near the 2 bears, and the 2 deathclaw found at Prime
---
Steel is from scrapping all of the weapons from the Scorched I kill
---
Digestive Goo/adhesive from all of the pitcher plants. This is tricky to harvest because if you miss your timing you can get nothing. You need to be quick. 
---
When we tested Berry Mentants/Stealth we were at Project Beanstalk event and could see across the field. It was just harder to see the highlight.
---
Is the chainsaw any good? I have never found one.
---
Yes, streaks are possible, although unlikely in general with a well balanced loot chance table and properly implemented RNG.
---
I see two cases: 1) same-effect different item is deliberately programmed in. 2) There is a bug in how RNG is calculated; the server may use a thread-unsafe method and concurrent use breaks it.
---
The queen was known to be bugged and appears to have an unique loot table and drop logic associated. She is the hardest to farm and measure.
---
Wow.  Great information.  Thanks my dude.
---
There is one part of the station with a door that goes into the hill side that would work perfectly for a underground base entrance, I think it even has a keypad / card swipe spot next to it already.
---
Power armor being weaker than regular armor bugs me. Maybe PA need legendary effects?
---
Cito agrees!
---
I think that‚Äôs awesome. I mean, yeah it sucks that no one was prepared for it, but you should never feel comfortable in this game. I shouldn‚Äôt be able to solo three S.B., and all their scorched that show up, but I can. Just adds a whole new challenge to the game, which I‚Äôm all for. 
---
Same thing happened to me.  Quit playing rather than deal with rebuilding and then having same crap happen.
---
This quest gets stuck for everyone. Seems like a few fast travels or new servers n then a crit triggers it. But it always starts a second one for me right after ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Just up the hill from Camp Venture is the Treetops and just past that is a Red Rocket. Treetops has a bobble spawn hiding in a set of standing bowling pins, a magazine spawn on a nightstand, and a locked safe (not sure what level). The RR has spawns in the building with a cooking station next to it: caps stash under the counter opposite the entrance, floor safe behind said counter, magazine on the floor against the outer wall near the stairs, bobble under the bed on the roof, and a Power Armor spawn behind the other building. On top of that I've had good luck getting the random events to occur by taking the paved road north from there.
---
Used to have my camp nearby and farmed these constantly, a lot of times every spawn would be there and I would also grab the fusion cores from the PA stations at RR and CV (along with the parts to sell if I had the room).
---
In 3 Hours 15 from this post it will be 7pm my time, I'll be on from then for a few hours on Friday if that is useful to you.
---
I'll throw Big B's Rest Stop into the mix. Not for anything other than a spawn point of three combat rifles. Often at high levels and easy to break down for learning mods on a new character. There is a power armor station and armor station around the Red Rocket station to break them down and then a STASH nearby to store any you want to keep. Hopped around several times on my level 16 stealth commando guy and by the time I hit level 20 and could use the combat rifle I already had all the mods I wanted. 
---
Good question I can‚Äôt prove this to you since I‚Äôm higher level 
---
I am going to choose option 2. 
---
To add to this: I keep finding the horde boss surrounded by max level enemies in a high level area but only being like level 10. 
---
Happened to myself, the way I managed to complete the task. Was I filled my crit bar while under the influence of the alcohol of choice, and then performed a crit. It then registered, and I moved onto finishing it.   
---
Hope this helps for you mate, if not. I suggest lodging a ticket.
---
While this explanation makes sense, I never had this happen for the months my base was exactly where it was before the BS message.  Doesn't matter now as I don't play anymore.
---
id gladly have my own Assultron, perhaps one with the stealth boy mod
---
I use Four Leaf Clover L1 and Psychopath L2 and I have crits all day. my Luck is only 6.
---
Yeah, the one in Welch is the only one I've seen that gives out ammo. There's also a dead assaultron beside it that consistently offers up her head as a weapon. I just sell that back at the station. The whole thing isn't always worth it, but it does allow one to clear the rest of the town without using a lot of previously stored ammo.
---
What spurred my interest in testing out ways to see/reveal stealthed players was I ran into a player who seemed to have no issue seeing me while stealthed from very far away. I wasn't going to scream "hacker" but rather I wanted to know how they were able to see me so easily.
---
sounds like a solid buddy 
---
Later tonight!
---
Would be cool
---
I don't understand your sentence. Do you have rolling pins in your character's inventory but none in your stash? Do you get way more rolling pins in this case?
---
3/4 of my dailies have been alcohol related since I started playing a few weeks ago.
---
I usually go to Harpers Ferry empty and hit the whole town. Then stop at the vendor and sell.
---
I believe there was no counter to these gamma guns. If you were seen, you were dead. You can't see either just like the original scorchbeast screams the community wanted gone.
---
It's also a great way to "balance" the sentinel/assassins/cavalier armors as they can't be used in nuke zones.
---
It's the same for Pharma Farma and Can Do!
---
r/fallout76settlements
---
You could be in an area where the gas is not visible to cause you issues. IMO a HUD icon would do the trick and not cause any potential frame rate issues
---
Can you only get this on combat armor or is it available on all types?
---
I get a lot of Mire #1 maps from my normal routine looting so I go there when I need a lot of Steel in a hurry, it has a workbench just a few steps from the dig site for scrapping &amp; 15 maps will usually net about 700-800 Steel.
---
Great idea.
---
Fine with me!
---
The difference in weight between bulk and non-bulked is the same whether it's in your inventory or in your stash.
---
[Here's a nice spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cH0AdM1waoEGxA0IRcAsuGtSyOk05COWopSbEsfZDds/edit#gid=953441877)
---
Im already dead
---
Was on my phone and was easier to just post a link than go back and edit in the app I'm using.
---
Agree. And you only hurt yourself because the game will make you wait a long time before respawning that plan location for you. The exception to this is a known plan in a container. Containers are instanced so if you find a desirable plan in a container, grab it and either sell it or give it to someone else. Otherwise, leave it be and re-roll.
---
I was practically the only one firing at the scorched, but because I was hazmat I died before I could kill most of the time. My TSE LMG was doing a lot of damage, but if you can't see the target through the green cones you can't hit it.
---
How do you server hop? just quit go to menu, quit, and reenter?
---
Thank you sir
---
I will post on that community ;) 
---
I'm still working my way through making a pistol build but I don't think I'll bother with crack shot. Concentrated fire is there though.
---
The 'build' is a melee and pistol build really. Splitting the bulk of SPECIAL across strength and agility. Lots of AP will help with sprinting/melee attacks which is handy. Then also a mix of the VATS perks. 
---
From other threads it seems pistol builds seem fairly underpowered compared to other builds but it's good fun. 
---
A lot of good info here. Also, I think most people know this, but to add to this, there are a lot of armor plan spawns in the display cases at Harper's Ferry as well as a lvl 3 locked safe I've gotten good plans from next to the vendor.
---
Its a cool item, and I do want it, but how secret would it really be if we all knew that they existed?
---
The entire weapon scrapping and leveling system is dumb anyway. I didn't even realize weapons had levels until I got to around 20 and couldn't kill anything due to dismal damage. And every 5 levels I have to build up new guns using up precious screws.
---
And since when does breaking something apart make you learn how to make something completely different on it? I don't know about you guys but when I break down my pistol to clean it I don't suddenly learn how to make a laser sight or longer barrel for it.
---
I know its a video game and its about balance but I feel like the FO4 system was fine as is or even the old NV system with condition. It made sense to be able to fix one weapon with another of the same type, and buying/discovering mod schematics makes more sense too.
---
Thank you again for an excellent job. If you ever need chems to make your farming life easier, please hit me up (PC).
---
IGN Coffeeurn aka your friendly neighborhood chem dealer
---
I remember doing a Fallout 4 playthrough and I built 5 robots with different abilities. I started with Ada and did some tweaking, then I created Eda, Ida, Oda, and Uda. I loved the building in that game. 
---
Exactly I have my character with all weight reducing and I have countless of the same type of weapon with different prefix and no rolling pins on stash yet on yesterday‚Äôs run I got 6 armor pieces ( all 1 star ) a instigating gauss ( only 1 star ) 1 rolling pin and one of of those long ones that look like long sickles , funny enough this is my 5th one but worth keeping since it‚Äôs 3 stars.
---
Do you have any specific worksheet your using ? 
---
I would love to help with some metric as well with my character bearing all these weapons  
---
Does anyone ever let the Insult Bot live? When I get insulted the only course of action is to immediately smash it like a raging toddler.
---
Yes please 
---
I ran into one of these, some generous vault dweller left 8 plans, 5 of which I didn't know at RG (?) Station south of the Ash Heap. I was quite surprised and happy. I also left my known plans there for the next lone wanderer. 
---
Thanks to you and that mysterious stranger for doing this. 
---
100% this 
---
There's a big gameplay part when it comes to nuked zones that does not fit well on non-PA builds.
---
It will come down to Hazmat and you can't have that many perks that passively increase dr/er, mostly because Endurance is bad with said builds, Junk Shield requires 46 or more junk items on your inventory to become effective, while Evasive being the most reliable choice so let's say 70 dr/er.
---
If you're going for experience, legendary drops or stuff to craft fluxes it will comes down in how fast you can kill (or hit enough) things when you're on one, and for that part you'll lose stealth and you will have to get hit and with that much dr/er you won't last long. 
---
If you get company, expect the big, meaty PA dudes to block your line of sight (thank goodness for passive mode), aoe guns like tesla rifle or explosive weeapons can be the most helpful. 
---
The best I can suggest is to nuke the corner of the [Whitespring Golf Club like this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:Whitespring_selected.png), rejoin the same server by inappropriately sending invites to strangers who might expect you want to wreck their camps and hope that people won't stand next to the club because it will cause the cell to persist and in most cases fail to spawn the ghouls. 
---
When it comes to steel (and plastic) the scrapper perk is a godsend. 
---
Be prepared for 2-3 angry snallygasters at Larry's though!
---
Since last patch I've actually been getting legendary loot (only 1*) from non-legendary enemies, mainly ghouls.
---
Idk about fitting both
---
How do we know they don't already exist? 
---
This is great and all but I don't think it really demonstrates any real pattern. I still feel it's our brains looking for patterns and explanations. 
---
Its probably in maintenance mode.  It will allow no new connections, and then alert someone to reboot it after the last person disconnects.
---
50 that‚Äôs an awesome defense buff!! What‚Äôs the downside of this mutation ?
---
Do you have an idea if it works with scaly skin ?
---
Since scaly skin is the counterpart of this mutation only for ballistic ( or in confused lol )
---
You can also do it by bringing up the social menu in-game (ctrl+tab on pc) and then click your name at the top and pick 'leave world'. That's a little quicker.
---
I had it happen to me, and uh I kinda forced it on a friend after telling him to move his node and it did the same thing to him. This wasn‚Äôt a problem before the last update. The whole ‚ÄúFuture content‚Äù in places where there won‚Äôt be any.
---
2-3 hour launch time limit then you get booted and a 8 pm 24 hour reset cooldown from entering that specific site. You don't really need to launch more than 3 nukes in a day. Hell i launched 2 last MONTH.  IF you need to be in  radiation that bad all day ..server hop or find some friends that are launching. 
---
Thought that was gonna be 'excuse me what the fuck'
---
NO DARKER NIGHTS UNTIL THE LIGHTING ON POWER ARMOR LIGHTS IS FIXED
---
It reduces damage DEALT.
---
So even after the latest hotfix, this issue still persists. I've actually given up on running around in my power armor while using my VATS character simply because I'd rather do other things besides farming for cores while I'm online.
---
Sweet , what‚Äôs your asking price ( I happen to have a spare ) just checking if it‚Äôs worth hoarding 
---
Desperately want to do a pistol build but I think thier perk cards are lacking atm when lined up next to the other groups.
---
I'm really enjoying my vats crit rifle build and it's not even optimised yet. I never used to use the vats system in any of the games and was dubious of it in this. But once you're used to it and have the perks to get extra out of it it's awesome. Late game you can just clear while groups almost instantly, feels like I'm doing the gun kata from equilibrium.
---
It's also fun not putting any points in strength and playing with the luck and agility trees more. 
---
I will just be getting home around 11pm your time, so Friday will most likely be the best time to meet.
---
You built it somewhere that they blocked off for future content. 
---
Oh, well if the shop has limited space, then that is a ridiculously stupid failure on their part.
---
It would also explain why there isn't anything I want to buy most of the time. Availability and selection are so important to the success of any store. Imagine shopping on Amazon if they only carried 100 products, and changed the items randomly. They would never have stayed in business like that.
---
There should be hundreds of items in the Atom store, just as there are hundreds or thousands of added items available as mods for Fallout 4 and Skyrim.
---
The other stupid thing about limited time sales is that some of us can't play every day or week. I guess if I travel, become ill, get busy with work, school, family, or relationships, or even if my computer breaks, they don't want my money (?)
---
All of the thinking behind the Atom store seems wrong to me. Few items and high prices are not the way to encourage a high volume of microtransactions.
---
Neat. Only one I've ever found was low level. :(
---
With perks they bulk differently in inventory vs stash. 
---
So in order to get more trapper items or radium rifles, I need more radium rifles or trapper armor? Do the things stashed need to be legendary?
---
I have a full heavy weapon character and its insanely good fun. Just melt whatever you look at. 
---
It does have NV scopes, I think you need plans for those though. I haven‚Äôt gotten the long barrel yet but that sounds goofy as hell so now I want it.
---
There‚Äôs at least one bayonet mod. It‚Äôs cylindrical with spikes on the end so looks pretty cool for style points 
---
It's mostly mole-miners, the cave crickets are generally on the outside. You could always mine an area and lure them into it
---
That's the problem, killing the Queen is important, but no crowd control?  That is bad tactics.  I use VATS when normal visual targeting is fubarred.  Just use the Force.
---
I think you're def right. Do you think we should be able to one shot eachother?
---
You could probably force this with internet lag. 
---
Just don‚Äôt make it another kill legendaries because that one was kinda messed up for team efforts 
---
Could‚Äôve been. I‚Äôve been all about railway rifles from day 1, trying to find a good one. 
---
I think the amount of charge is reliant on the amount of luck you have on your character. Mine runs around at 11 luck and I've seen ranges of 35-98% charge
---
That's sad :'( PA is so cool
---
Believe it or not, server-hop farming is fun to some people. Not me, but I do know people who see it as a thrill of the hunt kind of thing. Has the same appeal as slot machines, I guess. Not my thing, but I'm sure there are a lot of people who would scoff at me spending 90% of my play time gathering scrap and organizing my stash lol. Like I told someone last night, FO76 is a hoarding simulator for me. I think that's what makes Fallout games great. There's something for everybody. 
---
Someone said to me that there rare so maybe above 500 I've also seen posts for them like that to I have no idea 
---
I've come across this before, although I think it was during one of the Surface to Air events in the Bog, not a Nuke Zone.  I thought it was pretty cool.
---
Hard to say if it's a bug though.  We definitely see Scorched with Miniguns they can't use, which is probably a by-product of the same weird inheritance bug that gives us Rad-Rats with Sentry Bot properties - here, Scorched are being confused with Super Mutants - but I don't think any enemy in the game uses a Gamma Gun by default.
---
The randomization of the world, public events, tons of loot-able items, weather systems,  nukes, base building and quest. 
---
I'm a run both those perks maxed now. I hope it helps ty!!
---
I can name several great single player games within the last few years. It‚Äôs not dead at all....
---
PS4 SORRY:'(
---
They had those gorilla textures from fo4 they could probably make a few bucks with it if added to atom store ...
---
Bethesda listen to us !!!
---
&gt; Are you spending a lot of time farming the same server each session? 
---
I stay on a server as long as I can. I can get usually 1-3 hours before I'm kicked. I have an [effect-per-server breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1199519143) but too few items per server to be conclusive in general.
---
&gt; That means 2 other people also got it and sold it 
---
I play solo and try to avoid locations when I see people there.
---
&gt; So maybe this gives weight to the idea that the RNG is seeded and each server has a different seed. 
---
It is possible there is a server-wide default loot chance table. For example, server A has a table with twice the chance for Assassin's items. However, when you log in, a player specific chance table is generated based on the inventory/stash and the server table. So you'd see a lot more Assassin's but also you'd see your favorite Troubleshooter's items as well. I don't know and to verify this theory, I'd need a friend with time and same goal, play together on the same server but not in a team and try to kill the same mobs at once.
---
&gt; As a further experiment, maybe server hop after every area you clear. 
---
I plan to do that, but may happen only in a few months.
---
&gt; Stashed and equipped items have 0 effect on my drops. I hoard chameleon, weightless, and all legendary rifles.  
---
Armor is certainly odd. I'd love more Weightless armor myself, but I hoarded them to no good benefit. It could be all my other hoarded items overshadowing weightless armor or that the streak-logic taking precedence over hoarding.
---
I'll keep logging and once my loadout stabilizes, I can do a more targeted testing of specific items/effects.
---
I think I have the 2card version of that running but I'll max it
---
:'( RIP power armor
---
Is concentraded fire in agi? And yeah it is under Powered but i dont want to have a op build that is so powerful that nothin but scorch beast queen gives a good challenge
---
I wonder if scrounger perk will proc a chance for a fusion core since it's classified as ammo? I've got every extra search perk card except for that one.
---
Further increase is through lifegiver perk.
---
Is this crits against other players or against NPCs?
---
I‚Äôm slowly shifting in to taking all the weight reducing cards , and focus merely on having damage increasing ones only 
---
the defense buff is 100 DR, your energy weapons only deal half damage
---
scaly skin adds 50 DR to both energy and ballistic
---
You can't trade them at this point.  You stop earning SPECIAL points at Lv. 50, but you never stop earning cards at each level.  After Lv. 50, you can re-allocate a single SPECIAL point from one category to another if you want, per level.
---
I miss him to 
---
thanks
---
There's also a level 2 safe in a closet across from the elevators in the lobby. I find higher quality weapons and armor in there. Lots of gauss guns, handmades, etc to scrap to learn mods. 
---
Yes it is.  I think FAR too many people overlook this aspect of the game.  In fact, FO76 has become one of my favorite fallout games.  No human NPCs does NOT mean 'no story'.  The way the stories are told reminds me of games like 'system shock'...but on a far grander scale.   I play the game solo and take my time.   Environmental storytelling fits well with this play style. 
---
However, environmental storytelling doesn't fit as well for folks who play the game with others.   Other players can be impatient, etc... and I think that is why many end up missing out on a lot of what the game has to offer.    There are also many higher lever players that want to 'help out' newbies...but I think that can somewhat ruin the experience before they realize it.  
---
Not that I agree with this, but I think Bethesda thinks of radshield as an ‚ÄúOP‚Äù version of Rad-X, especially since you can stack it with Rad-X diluted, get super rad resistance in a nuke zone and still keep your mutations.  Thus, it isn‚Äôt easy to farm and create.  
---
Just as long as it doesn‚Äôt actually say unlearnt.
---
Does it work with the Camden park hot dogs ? üòÇ
---
&gt; So you say you are comparing game mechanics... and then you start talking about bugs and netcode? 
---
Erhm you started that shit do you remember, cause i do. Im salty ? I wasnt the one getting a hard on about battlefield. Anyway have a good one Sir.
---
Threadception
---
Level 2 do too. I've gotten lots of ballistic scrap and better weapons and armor to scrap to learn mods. I never mess with lvl 1 or 0 locks, but 2 and 3, it's worth the time to swap perk cards.
---

---
Sorry i was just being a Sarcastic Asshole.
---
 The link is awesome and i've been looking for something like it. Thank you
---
The pa can count as cover if you exit and hid behind it. Could work
---
I don't know. If you have the spare room, you could try and see if you get a boost or not. Not sure when I can test this specifically as I stash legendaries only.
---
Expect a 10 minute video from your favorite YouTube spammer 
---
With perks they well less in stash, but the percentage less is the same whether bulked or not.
---
fixed
---
There is a lot of good story in the game.
---
The game visually looks like it was made in 2005. They keep using the same outdated engine for their games.
---
Daily reminder:  energy weapons are still sub par so it doesn‚Äôt really matter.  
---
Yes!  i want to only be able to see what my pip boy light shines on. I want to be scared shitless
---
Yeah, I don't typically use Power Armor and I'm fine with this restriction.  It makes Nuke Zones "special."
---
Hey, good talk, salty boy.
---
I'm not sure its for xp farming as there comes a point when your level is just a representation of how long you've been playing. Post 50 everyone is "equal" with respect to the Special points placed. I'd say post 100 or 110, people would be pretty even in their perk card builds and leveled up what they wanted. For now at least.
---
That leads me to believe if its an actual nerf, its to slow gear farming at one of the few viable spots for it. Unless theres something they're not disclosing yet regarding legendary players and how the system will work when becoming legendary and they want to slow leveling down. I've moved from whitesprings to fissure sites anyways though...
---
This also keeps happening to me, probably a 50/50 chance of crashing when I successfully unlock something. Any solutions out there? 
---
You are welcome to log your own experience and find or disprove any pattern or theory.
---
I think there's confusion. What you're saying isn't clicking. It is the same number as my cores. I swap weaps when I have 600 shots to fire and swap back again. I now have 13 shots to fire. I lose about 587 shots?
---
Its totally up to what main effect it has, Bloodied and anti armor explosive seem to be most expensive (10-25k), twoshot/Instigating explosive maybe after those and others are a little cheaper. Also depends on how bad seller needs caps
---
Oh boy I'm really getting hated on here. I know what a reenactment is. It's cute and quant for the civil war, but who would want to cosplay as confederate trash? 
---
I've met those people, it's all fun and games on the surface, a strange obsession with states rights under the surface, and pure bigotry on the inside.
---
Upgrade that bad boi! üòÅ
---
Daily reminder, my non legendary Gauss deals 444 damage per shot + sneak crit multiplier
---
I feel like I've come across this too.  I had a 3\* Instigating Assault Rifle at one point and for the life of me, I couldn't get it past damage in the 70s while my Handmade was almost 50% more than that, even with Hardened on both.  I wound up dismissing Assault Rifles together.
---
The survival game I have the most experience besides fallout 76 is ark and although there‚Äôs a special place in my heart in ark the thing I don‚Äôt like about it is it‚Äôs not for solo players. I think I am really good solo player in it. I got a 150 turrets up last attempt at playing it but still managed to get wiped by a group with two stegos. That‚Äôs when I decided I was done with that game. 
---
There is a naming bug in which a "Diseased" enemy may not get the "Legendary" name prefix. I don't record these cases as they always drop 1*. I never ever encountered a 2-3* drop from a misnamed mob.
---
What's the event called?
---
No, you have a pretty good point there. It seems like Bethesda just kinda thought their world design would do it for them. 
---
‚ÄúOkay now my little Lvl 39‚Äôs and below, only stay in the Forrest, don‚Äôt go out to the mire, cranberry bog, or the Savage Divide you little cuties. Wouldn‚Äôt want you guys getting hurt now‚Äù - Todd the God
---
The stories that are told in FO76 are a not-so-subtle critique of the way the world is today.  Which is what Sci-fi often does.  
---
Nice work there shopkeep :)
---
I‚Äôd expect at around the 1 year anniversary the vault gets reopened and everything put up for a limited time sale.  Whomever they have working the atom shop now knows what they are doing from a pricing/retiring/etc standpoint.
---
Wow, great vid! That sword does 700+ damage? What perks are you running?
---
Setting up a confederate faction in this game sounds like an easy way to generate a lot of unnecessary hate
---
I think stranler pods can be found at night and blooms during the day or other way around cant remember 
---
Violin?  If you want to play in West Virginia, you‚Äôve got to have a fiddle in the band...

---
Lucky Hole Mine as others have said then you need some acid I farm acid by server hopping Mountainside Bed and Breakfast 2 Yao Guai's will always spawn by the train cars beware they are level 16-78 but you do have the high ground advantage. 2 Lead ore 1 acid = 5 Lead add in ammosmith and Super Duper and you can craft 12-15k rounds of 50 cal in a couple hours or less.
---
[I have a sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=0) you could use as a template for your own tracking.
---
I may be wrong, but I seem to notice that there's a play-time component as well. A few weeks ago, I didn't have much time to play so I just stayed at Whitespring to sell some scrap and loot the area. I only played for an hour or so at a time but in a week's play, I didn't have any of the containers respawn for me. However, on the weekends, I've had times where I played for 10 hours and in that time, I looted a container AND had it respawn its contents.
---
Hope you made the most of it haha
---
Oh, right, in the Institute. I even set them loose once.
---
You mean like fallout 4? That's a crazy idea. 
---
There are so many things about this game that I think would have been better if had been left the same as F4
---
Problem is, you then run into an acid shortage. Fun times. 
---
Sometimes I wonder if that guy running around Watoga smashing everything realizes that the legendary spawns in the same spot every time. No need to kill the other 20 bots......just kill the legendary ones and don't break the game.
---
One of the new feature badges in the roadmap looks like Vault Boy waving at a robot.

On PS 4 console, how do you server hop?
---
I've never done it before.
---
It's always a treat to find plans I don't know even at level 300. I always leave about 5 plans at least for every one I take. I always leave chems too, and drinks and dog food. I love it. The thing that bothers me, and that I can't let influence my generosity, is stuff like this:
---
Putting chems and plans in the overseer's chest in Flatwoods. I must have been invisible because this level 90 comes in and starts vacuuming them up while I'm putting them in. I'm kind of irked, so I leave, and as I leave I say "YOU'RE WELCOME BRUH" and he says "Oh...oh, um, thanks?"  shame on a level 90 for stealing from low level  noobs but whatever. Lazy twat lol 
---
no u :D
---
The explosive effect is specific to the gun, just uses normal ammo.
---
There are a few times I was overencumbered and trying to figure out what to drop, and checking my stash at that point was difficult. 
---
Nope. Just a perk on legendary weapons in the 2nd prefix. 
---
Had this happen myself.  Relog and weapon swap worked for me.
---
It was inevitable that they'd start playing hardball with the Atom Shop.  This is a game that continually costs Bethesda money to upkeep and maintain, and free Atoms aren't going to give them that.
---
Personally though, I think they screwed up the pricing by overcompensating for free Atoms.  If the same real cash prices translated to 50% more Atoms than they currently do, then that offer would look more attractive.  Right now, I just end up waiting until I grind enough Atoms in-game, because there's very little in the Atom Shop I need to have right away - "leaving soon" or not.
---
I also want to point out that nothing in this really suggests that OP's assumption about stash/inventory affecting drops is accurate. 
---
It seems like OP is experiencing a bit of confirmation bias here.
---
&gt; even though I had Weightless in my inventory and in my stash, it was a rarer drop.
---
&gt;In contrast, I get disproportionately many Exterminator's armor. I don't stash such items but one of my guns is an Exterminator's Handmade. 
---
&gt;I never keep or stash Unyielding and Vanguard's, yet I get many of these too.
---
&gt;There are odd counter examples: Medic's, Berserker's, Junkie's and Nocturnal's I don't use or keep at all
---
The rate of legendary spawns is awesome info, but I think OP's ideas on the loot RNG formula might be a bit off.
---
Same here...  but I still learn a couple of mods each day from plans or scrapping.  
---
Early on, I typically didn‚Äôt lug around mini-guns and Gatling Lasers just to scrap for mods.   I‚Äôve been doing more of this lately.   
---
And I find very few handmades.  I need to buy the Handmade plans and just spam build 100 of them and scrap them.  And don‚Äôt get me started on the derth of power armor mod plans.  
---
I started using the Scrapper perk again.   I forgot just how much steel you get when you use it.   It‚Äôs why I stopped using it.   I found that I was finding enough steel without it. 
---
For the love of fuck please for no reason make this game any darker ever
---
Thanks, now i gotta server hop for the mod üòÅ 
---
Also in the yard there are weights
---
Careful flaunting that, the Brotherhood may show up to confiscate it...
---
This is a good idea.
---
Ignore the useless ‚Äúexpert advice‚Äù you‚Äôre getting. I had the same problem with a lone floating half wall. Twice.
---
I had my husband join my team, come to our house, leave my team, and then attack my floating half wall until it was completely destroyed (just the outline showing). I was then able to highlight and destroy it.
---
It may have been a fluke, but try that. I was so pissed at that floating half wall before that it made me quit the game. I‚Äôve since quit for other reasons.
---
At level 40 are all the secrets divulged?  There are SO MANY elements and silent rules to this game (even so early) that are not explained.
---
Congrats, I'm still looking for one. :)
---
You more interested in Adventure mode or Survival?
---
I agree. It's kind of silly that it's not there.
---
There is also the same graffiti in Fort Defiance, on the wall in one of the cells; same ‚Äúhandwriting‚Äù and everything

It's for aesthetics.

Ah nice. I didn‚Äôt play the week it came out and when I signed in I had no notifications or anything relating to the content/quest. 
---
Eh? Jump has always been spacebar on every Bethesda game I‚Äôve played, and E for interact. This is how nearly every game I‚Äôve played does it. 
---
I‚Äôm never able to move my camp and the first thing I always do when rebuilding is move the node out of the way. It makes sense now. 
---
Thanks, I did not know that. 
---
I got the 3* instigating rolling pin with 40% power +1 charisma.
---
Also, just run by it if it's already owned and see if the processor is locked. Most people don't lock it after powering it up, so you can usually snag a couple of free 100% cores with zero risk or effort. 
---
Tbh I find everything I need through networking with the community. A lot of people trade but only within their own communities because the Market and Bazaar can be a little cancerous and honestly I don't blame them. Sent assassin is the only thing I find that has any real scarcity but any weapon i've wanted regardless of obscurity someone I know or someone they know has one.   
---
Also TSE and AAE are pretty commonly traded, I don't do enough with BE to tell from first hand experience but I've bought and sold multiples of both of those in the past few days
---
it is a legendary prefix. they use normal ammo
---
r/whooosh
---
none that I know of its almosf unplayable for me at the moment. there is a post at the bethesda forums with a view people having the same issue but no official replay.
---
Time to use those stealth boys or Crouch  play the entire game... 
---
Not exactly, more so that at lvl 40 some of the more difficult areas become more comfortable feeling and most the events become doable. Whereas if you tried Uranium Fever (the most popular event) at a lower level you‚Äôd prolly get whooped pretty easily cause most the enemies are lvl 40. 
---
I had a hard time in the Whitespring and in Watoga (before completing the mayor for a day quest that makes you not hostile to the robots) at those lower lvls. And I would say that around that time you‚Äôll prolly have grasped most the concepts. Tho I‚Äôm a melee build and so it never really mattered to me, I didn‚Äôt know to learn gun mods you had to scrap the gun you wished to learn a mod for until I was in my 40s. 
---
So I can totally see where you‚Äôre coming from about the lack of explanation the game tends to have. 
---
What lvl are you now? 
---
You stated it doesn‚Äôt work but not exactly why it doesn‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs not very helpful.
---
Can't use vats without my unyielding armor or in a hazmat while overencumbered. I'd fire 1 bullet and be out.
---
Just wanna point out that it's impossible to get both explosive and increased damage while aiming effects. And it's only 10%, not 40.
---
Sweet thanks viable if you don‚Äôt use no energy at all
---
Am I misreading the going away sales? All I saw on the message is they are leaving the atom shop, not that they will never come back again.
---
Definitely do the Breach and Clear quest if you see it. Usually get between 80-100 lead ore from this. Also iron,copper, silver, gold, and uranium ores. Then chem lab away with the Super Duper perk.
---
I typically do but did not for this. I don't nuke zone much because of that, I did not notice low health players. 
---
The artist negotiated a contract that ZeniMax agreed to that stipulated the song would not be used unless the artist approved the exact use.  
---
By using the song in a commercial centering around the graphic violence typical to FO games, ZeniMax violates the terms that were agreed upon by both parties since ZeniMax did not allow the artist approve beforehand.  
---
Defendant‚Äôs Commercials were objectionable because they featured repeated homicides in a dark, dystopian landscape, where violence is glorified as sport. The killings and physical violence were not to protect innocent life, but instead were repugnant and morally indefensible images designed to appeal to young consumers.
---
‚ÄúIn The Wanderer, Dion gives life to the story of a sad young man who wanders from town to town, not having found himself or the capacity for an enduring relationship. The song describes isolation during coming of age. Without Plaintiff‚Äôs consent, Defendants dubbed The Wanderer into commercials in which the protagonist, a wanderer, roams from one location to the next, armed and hunting for victims to slaughter. Defendant‚Äôs Commercials have no redeeming value, they simply entice young people to buy a videogame [sic] by glorifying homicide, making the infliction of harm appear appealing, if not also satisfying.‚Äù
---
Why is it fucked up to you that the artist is bringing suit because ZeniMax failed to follow a simple contract agreement?  I don‚Äôt blame the artist one bit since both parties agreed to the terms.  Don‚Äôt break legal agreements- it‚Äôs very straight forward 
---
*brings chair and costume with caps sign*

Lol thanks for the note I sold one to a vendor for 5 caps once , made sure not to do it again 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs like the hit box just doesn‚Äôt register anything. Sometimes you have to swing four times to get it to register. 
---
Also use the four leaf clover perk. Each pellet can proc the perk.you'll have a crit ready almost every shot.

Took me two server hop clearing the same building.
---
I just learned yesterday that you can put plans inside dead player's loot bags. I dropped some plans in a lvl 11's death bag yesterday after finding out.
---
Just go back into your level up menu and you can choose a special to put a point in. 
---
Something tells me they aren't getting the Survival Mode participation they had hoped for...
---
My thoughts too.
---
I think that vendors do get legendaries but only when someone sells one to them.
---
So many QOL oversights in this game its actually ridiculous. Where‚Äôs that ‚Äúattention to detail‚Äù Todd was flexing at the Fallout 4 E3 showcase?
---
Great! I can't wait to get a bunch of levels so I can..... uhh.... why do I want to level faster?
---
Got to 18 last night.  I have been piddling around though, going really really slowly.  Met a few much higher level players and one introduced me to the white springs golf course/hotel at level 9.  I went back to the hotel to sell/explore at 15 and came across a grip of enemies lvl 40+.  
---
Which freaked me out.  Been trying to figure out this whole workshop claiming thing, and reading up on events.  
---
I wanted to post the same thing. Thx.
---
A week ago this guy was telling me his tesla had 199 damage and i almost argued with him 'cause it was impossible compared to mine. Then i took class freak of and the damage didn't change. So yeah he was right bacause i'm cutting away half the damage!

IMO having high Strength and Perception offers the most versatile build. With max Strength you can freely change between all Melee styles and heavy weapons. With high perception you can freely change between semi and auto rifles, and with a good amount in Agility you can use stealth perks when using rifles and adrenaline and action boy when using melee weapons and heavy weapons.

that seems... annoying... since that particular location is one of a relative few that reliably spawns convenient ants for Biv's rad ant lager.
---
It's neat they let us build there, but when it's a level 10 abusing turrets to tag/kill a level 91 deathclaw spawning for the frequent high level traffic there just seems like it needs fixed.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Guess I'll have to give it a try finally. I'll be the level 62 easy kill. Meh.
---
Seems any time I wander out alone to new territory I come across enemies way out of my league.  I guess I just need to stay in the safer areas and level up more before going on any questlines. :(
---
Just as long as you're not level 5 running in with a crappy pipe gun :) The are good for loot tho. Lots of food at Larry's too.

NP .Found this pretty active community a while ago, thought I would share.

Perhaps, still ima try the reciever change and see. I still feel the AR is viable, it does what i need it to, but theres definately a bug going on

Is there any benefit from keeping recipe basics like mutafruit in your inventory? Think it should be stashed too
---
Snallygasters are nasty
---
This is only the 1000th time it has been suggested since the beta. I honestly don't think they're listening. If they are, then it's pretty clear they don't care. 
---
Made some testing this past 2 days you don‚Äôt have to do anything other have completed That one mission that drains chemicals on river then it‚Äôs as easy as walking and farming them , keep in mind that takes a while to replenish insure that server hoping helps as I only needed one , and used green thumb and got two .
---
Pods at day bloom at night , during day you have about 4 pods and one bloom active , not sure about night time.
---
You don't? You're doing it wrong then.
---
Double XP weekend is coming to both adventure and survival April 25-29 as well 
---
Perks for one 
---
Thank you.   165 levels in or so, and I have been a melee man!   
---
Honestly extending area broadcast to become a radio broadcast wouldn't be that crazy to implement and I could swear that at some point around the original November lauch that something from Bethesda acted like this might be a thing.  But I really don't know if I could find it in the sea of garbage from back then.
---
I'm such a noob. Lol. Thank you!
---
I can‚Äôt be the mechanist without my army of robots 
---
Yo! Awesome post. No idea where it is (I'm sorry for being useless üòÇ) but I found a location that spawned like 20 safes in one area. Like this guy's house and in his backyard has a collection of safes he was trying to open before the bombs.
---
This got a lot of Downvotes for some reason. I logged into my alts to keep it at one :/
---
Or a fiddle, yeah !
---
2.5-4k
---
found it.............sneaky................brill
---
A final total of 520 health.
---
Not sure about the recipe, but people usually sell serums for 250-500 caps per.
---
Correct.  But they are 99% crap and the system wipes them out in a couple of hours.  Its useless.
---
Another location for plastic is that fairground NW of vault 76. 
---
Nuka Cola Cup and Straw gta
---
What about the knight SGT how much would that go for 
---
Does your router have the right ports open? Sometimes these games require certain ports to b play. I had the same problem and that seemed to fix it.
---
That is basically what I'm running with for quite a while now and it gets me everywhere. Maybe not as fast a pure melee or rifle build, but that's Ok for me. 
---
I keep alot of stuff on my character because of reduced item weight perks/gear, also perishable items because of good with salt. Perks dont apply to items in the stash.
---
The vegan perk will make your mic twice as loud, to make sure everyone around hears about how you are a vegan.
---
Unless they changed their game either using something on their monitor or GPU control panel. Then they could potentially see during night nearly as good as during day and have substantial advantage.
---
I just kill all the sentry bots at whitesprings whenever I log in and can usually get 2-4 cores
---
Is there ever any benefit to un-bulking items?  I can't think of any reason.  This was changed in a patch not too long ago and everyone assumed it was a mistake.  It needs to be changed back ASAP.
---
We all started at the beginning at some point, what system are you? I‚Äôll be trying survival for those first time with my low character on Xbox 
---
Grinding and 3000 rounds of ammo for this.  I am better off going to wes tec and sever hop to get better.
---
I have about 10 of each mask, 3 berets and duplicates of most of the plans/recipes.   Trying to figure out fair prices for when we get our vending machines.   thinking 500 caps per mask and no less than 1500 for the beret.  I know that seems high, and i'm sharing in hopes to see what people think, i want your honest opinions/suggestions.  I figure the hunters long coat is about 800 from the vendor bot, i've been selling it for 1200.  
---
I think the story told is amazing. However I maintain that the story and immersion would only be improved by the presence of NPC's. Even in small pockets of crumbling safety. Imagine noticing that an enclave Scout is watching your team. Imagine helping the few remaining Free States members and tangibly change the world you're playing in. Inclusion of a few (due to the scorched virus) friendly or enemy NPC's would only make the game better.
---
No you didn't 
---
So, I don‚Äôt know how aware you are of this, or if you play the game. But there‚Äôs a ‚Äúserious problem‚Äù that Bethesda needs to address, because it may be affecting their Atom shop revenue.
---
My husband and I as well as two friends who play really want to buy All Teh Bedz, but won‚Äôt touch them because they‚Äôre all stupidly small, as if built for a child. No, I‚Äôm not talking about just the actual child‚Äôs beds (princess, race car, bunk beds). I mean all of them. The four poster bed included. They look stupid how small they are, and if your character stretched their legs out, they would hand over.
---
Just an FYI that I really want to spend money, but won‚Äôt until those get right-click fixed or something. Please pass it along.
---
Already did a few levels in survival. Hope to get my pvp character done.
---
Just stay away from the train stations and you‚Äôll be ok
---
I advise you stick to the Forrest, Ash Heap where all the mining places are, and the Toxic Valley to the North where Grafton and the Civil War place is. Google Fallout 76 map territories to learn each place. Even I forget which place is which from time to time. But the Savage Divide and the rest of the right side of the map(Cranberry Bog and The Mire) I would avoid for a while
---
It's so cool.
---
Oh yeah it's still up there.
---
If the recipes cost something like 18,000 Caps in game, where are players finding these to give away for 3K?  I've heard they sporadically can drop off the Scorchbeast Queen, but that's about it.  Maybe that's presuming you've done enough SBQ battles to get past the ridiculous number of Prime Receiver plans she can drop.
---
There‚Äôs already vegan/vegetarian food, I‚Äôve come across tinned imitation seafood, rice and beans in a tin, Vegetarian ham, and swamp tofu, I was surprised and impressed lol
---
What shirt are you wearing?
---
Sugar grove is good for it like the other commenter said, Whitespring bunker has a bunch of fans too. Some of the farms on the western edge have a kid‚Äôs bedroom that will have toys that you can scrap for screws. 
---
Actually here‚Äôs a link to Eurogamer article I found that not only shows a map of the game with each territory labeled but the preferred lvls to be when going into said areas [EuroGamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076) 
---
Many a True Nerd created a pretty comprehensive video essay on Fallout 76 and that was one of the topics he brings up in the first 10 minutes. 
---
Fallout 76 - What Went Wrong &amp; How To Fix It
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W31mxU9s6MI
---
I'm on PS4. This is my first ever Fallout and first MMORPG. Level 60 something but still feel like there's so much I don't know. Thus lurking on this sub.
---
I do queen runs all the time and I find recipes from here not so often anymore because I‚Äôm leveling up but that‚Äôs why you create alts to get more opportunities for recipes and prime plans. That‚Äôs what I do
---
Lmaoooo
---
I think these are very real concerns inherent to MMO's and immersion. I just can't believe bethsoft's solution to that problem with NPC conversations is to get rid of them altogether.
---
nope. and no auto perks.
---
again , no big deal, mellee as well, pick up at damage x  and later it will drop significantly to y. doesn't bother me much or until I get somthing really good - then i'll be pissed
---
Man you were browsing pretty far back, comments bout 90 days old.
---
Like I said a little further down the thread, respond to the east of your camp note and if it‚Äôs Bonzie is somewhere stupid or somewhere where the game things you shouldn‚Äôt be it will remove your camp
---
Well, it was a pretty big hit in his time and has been used in different media since then. It has been covered a lot and even translated into other languages, like German, French, Italian.
---
It's probably one of the most famous songs ever used in Fallout. 
---
Theres even a movie called The Wanderers, though the film is named after the gang in the movie, it is an Italian-American gang and Dion, the guy who wrote the song, is Italo-American, too
---
And the song is in the movie:
---
https://youtu.be/iEQYwk4Euo8?t=32
---
Well, there aren't any patterns you've found, it seems everything is pretty much averaged. I play the game a great deal and I try to look for patterns but things like "nocturnal drops at night" just aren't true. I stash rifles a lot but wouldn't say I get more. One thing I do want to look into is if crafting or modding certain weapons has an effect but it's very hard to be able to prove one way or the other, as with these drops. Hence me saying the brain likes to find patterns. 
---
I have fond memories.  Those talon mercenaries kept my weapons and armour in perfect condition lol. 
---
I can‚Äôt say for recipes, but I typically see serums for 150-300 caps.
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Thank you for this post fellow vault dweller I will keep it in mind for my grinds.
---
While not exactly this, I think it's been hinted at in their roadmap.
---
One of the points they make is "a new main quest" coming with Nuclear Winter later this year.
---
I would wager that the continuation of the main quest is going to change the entire world. It'll factor in our using nukes to kill the scorchbeast queen / seal all the fissure around Appalachia, and probably cause some serious changes across the map.
---
Then, any new players that start the game after that update would be in a new world, and the main quest would reflect those changes. So instead of waking up in 76 ready to explore a new world, you're waking up elsewhere, ready to tackle a world that just narrowly stopped a plague of giant radioactive bats.
---
On a similar note, For an anti-armor explosive gatlin gun, what would a fair market price be? 
---
I disagree. If they have less, I can sell more.
---
I believe they mentioned new characters idea for each new survival season. It was in the Bethesda Game Day stream.
---
I'm starting to think Bethesda is removing certain items (Probably temporarily) because there can only be a certain number of items on the shop because of some arbitrary limit.  I hope not, and they're just trying to appeal to the impulse buyer when they read something is going away.
---
Honestly no. I can do without fallout becoming like every other chat in mp games with people constantly shouting inane insults except this time they're getting a robot to do it and you can't just mute them. 
---
Yes but I would also like a variety on this via mods.
---
I thought there was a "Toggle Unlockable" option somewhere, though I could never figure out how to make it work.  
---
just as I forgot watch that stream too, thanks for the info!
---
didn't play rust. Was thinking like diablo2 had gheed the gambler. Just a pile of random stuff to buy.
---
Oh jees I didn't even see how old this post was lol. I'm guessing you realised now though 
---
I could honestly do without that. That kind of stuff is why I am not a huge fan of mp in most games. The worst thing about mp is the people. 
---
Well I don't know about your experience but my experience (on PC at least) is that I keep seeing the same like ~10 players in the top 3 depending on the server and the time of day. So maybe it's just my region (Western US) but I think it's odd that I rarely see the same player in Adventure but I always see the same ones in Survival.
---
Someone should have killed that Scorched. They go down with 1 head shot.
---
A *game* theory! 
---
3 more to go. after that its, 'choose' a card or 'move' a special
---
My 3* armor drops are always lock picking and breath under water. So good.
---
Chainsaw will always spawn at the ranger station in the cranberry bog area. It‚Äôs kinda central in location of that terrain.  Far as I know there is no legendary drop to this weapon just the mods
---
Like the fucking ‚Äúescape‚Äù button. It used to mean menu, not a fucking map. 
---
MIRV takes finesse to use aim higher then usual , and btw you could take the mod out and make it a regular Fatman
---
Lol Sam atoms 
---
I don‚Äôt really remember tbh. I remember the guy I thought had it, he was from the original beta, not the official one. Had lots of wacky stuff. I wanna say he had an explosive missile launcher too. 100% he had a mutation called pacifist that had the same effect as the pacifist setting being switched on.
---
Which leaves you on 103 hp as far as maxdamage bloodies build goes, which is like half/third of average players health. Interesting.
---
Given the rarity I‚Äôd say nothing short of 3 k unsure of price touhg great find üëçüèΩ
---
Hey bud you‚Äôre still comin off as a bit negative here I‚Äôd really recommend you take your opinions to r/politics. I think I could be speaking for some of the people on this thread when I say that we don‚Äôt really want to hear your strong opinions on the civil war in a fallout subreddit.
---
Lots of them got them from duppers for a cheap price or got exceeded extras from queen
---
Ok thanks for the advice!
---
Yes, I think WASTELANDERS will likely do this.  I'm mostly just trying to get the ideas I've had in front of player and DEV eyes alike, in hopes some of the ideas will resonate.  I believe this post originally went up two months ago on the Bethesda Fallout 76 FORUM, but I've learned from the PAX EAST panel that maybe BGS doesn't follow those as closely as they do here.
---
Overall I love Fallout 76 and play it lots, but I really hope for it to take a more FALLOUT 4 turn with Settlments.
---
Oh good so I don‚Äôt have to try and find Grahm anymore (he should sell better loot if he ever wants to see me again)
---
I suggest only committing to this idea if ure on PS4 lol üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Then I can buy some!!
---
I don't know but at least on PS4 I see both servers full which is good.I don't really see many high level players anymore on adventure. I see very low levels in the mire and cranberry bog, like levels 5 and 10 and I wonder how they get there.
---
well, I really hate swapping perk cards out to pick locks so i'll prob only do lvl but thanks for the tip
---
All of this information is a godsend.  I can‚Äôt say thank you enough for taking this time to spell out so much about the game, and giving links to additional information you have provided.  I do play on pc and would like to send you a friend request 
---
It's always been that way for me. About one out of every ten times I try joining on someone I get an infinite loading screen.
---
Idk tbh. No one really talks about SGT.  Also I got all the paints legit (including elder) the prices for the plans are net really thought out yet in the market due to all the paint being rare.
---
I've got a furious w/50% VATS criticals. I don't aim it......I use VATS aim bot and because of the furious effect a solo nuke basically eliminates the furious modifier, I'm not even sure if the MIRV benefits from the furious modifier but at least there is a chance.
---
So.........
---
Is Bethesda going to fix the MIRV launcher VATS targeting so that it aims higher than usual before they make the weapon a reward?
---
Don't they have a developers room or something where developers can test weapons? Does anyone at Bethesda even play this game?
---
After attempt number 8 or 9 didn't you suspect it had no mods? 
---
I did but its just showing my cards.
---
Even though theres a perfectly good flashlight attached to thier wrist. A.K.A. the pipboy. I never have to use it in vanilla fallout because the nights are basically dusk out.
---
So it could be 5 to 10k ?
---
That'll be $7.99
---
I would say less then 5 should be it.
---
I'd be so down.
---
An abandoned warehouse that just kept growing mutated marijuana after the bombs.
---
Good idea!
---
Who says the glass bottle doesn't have a crack in it and is leaking little by little?
---
yep i went on a spree once where each search gave me a core or two
---
Is that not a paint?
---
Of course
---
I do the same, leaving kits of noob stuff in likely places like Flatwoods. I get annoyed when some high level dude runs in and just hoovers everything up to sell for a few caps. Oh well though, nothing has a 100% success rate.
---
My new favorite: leave vintage Nukashine in the overseer's camp. Have a nice ride, noob.
---
I would like an option to eat my excess junk. 
---
Bottle and Cappy Orange Jacket and Jeans. Part of the nuka paint questline. Have a spare if you are on ps4. My pan is the same as here Namu342.
---
Honestly i absolutely do not want a crap ton of event popups clogging my playtime and having to stop, look and read every time I hear a little ding -- and there's dozens of those events too. It'd be like checking your phone during a meeting every 2 minutes to check your messages. No thanks.
---
I much prefer going to the map and looking at the glowing hexagons and asking myself which one if any I'd like to do and then checking again in 20-30 minutes. I mean it's not like you're not checking the map every 10 minutes anyway.
---
And I don't know how you'd have the timer because there is no connection between how long the event lasts on the board and how long that event takes to complete. If anything when you click on the hex to go to the event there should be a 'This event has not yet started. Fast Travel anyway?' or 'This event is already underway. Fast Travel Anyway?" popup so at least you know you could be hitting the event as its nearing completion.
---
I haven't been back to survival since its initial launch day, but yeah, double XP will give me a reason to go back and try it again.
---
Yeah I have like 6 VNukashines I want to leave in the Overseer's chest hahaha gonna be a fun ride
---
If you feel the need to silence the guy who points out cosplaying as slave owners and white supremacists is problematic then I think I'm right where I need to be. 
---
Aren't you able to change the control scheme?
---
No idea, not actually bothered to use it yet 
---
Could we consider the *fiddle* instead?
---
Considering we can't smoke a pre rolled cigarette in game, only chew bubblegum, despite Solomon sending us for some mutated fern i think that's the extent of their weed related wiggle room
---
I‚Äôm on PC, rats.
---
I have picked up plans and server hopped and found plans at the same location again.  I was hopping at harpers ferry for the 2 plan spawns close to the spawn point and picked up the lower plan 3 time in an hour.  From what I saw it would either be a robot or marine plan.  Picked up 2 wetsuit plans at lower spawn in that hour so I think it‚Äôs timed on the server for respawn time
---
you kind of can, I tend to just put solid walls with windows and have a crafting bench next to it. you can jump through a window and start crafting if you're not in power armour. 
---
Or the second and 3rd are good, but the first is nocturnal or troubleshooters.... this is he case every other sent/cav piece I've farmed 
---
See mine is the exact opposite though. 1 out of every 10 I don‚Äôt get an infinite load.
---
Here's a good one: Last week my client crashed for the 542nd time, and in the 2ish minutes to force close the launcher, get a new beer, and re-log, someone launched a nuke on Whitesprings. I spawned with 5 seconds on the countdown. In the middle of the nuke zone. Boom.
---
Hey you have rad worms, you should get that checked out.
---
you da man!
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/21/fallout-76-nuka-cola-outfit-and-power-armor-paint-job-guide/ is the guide I used.
---
Well they had the rights they just  "used" it in the wrong way. Does anyone die in the wanderers? Just seems like everyone's Looking for a loophole to get rich quick. It's a good song and would have been cool if they could continue using it!
---
That‚Äôs weird then, sounds like either a bug or you took one without realizing. Sorry man hope you get it sorted. 
---
Bait...
---
#ITS A TRAP!
---
Gauss deals ballistic damage.
---
All great ideas. I've been trying and failing to find any RP communities for PC in this game, and I believe that is largely because of the difficulty of actually RPing within the game. Adding even some of these would drastically help, even just doing the simple thing of displaying character names instead of our IGN. A good and thoughtful post.
---
TIME TRAVEL! Jebediah meet the Mirv Launcher bitch!
---
Gotem üòéüòéüòé
---
The explosive missile launcher was never in the game, and the pacifist mutation I havent heard about before, but in beta anything was possible 
---
Well in that case I find it quite odd that with the Grounded mutation my Gauss damage is 222 instead of 444
---
Yeah something happened to melee, my first hits arent registering!!!
---
this is a serious bug, its like every patch makes things worse F
---
They do have those at the bottom center of the screen whenever you go to mod them?
---
where did you get the flamer mod ? i have it on my pc character, but nor on my xbox :/ and cant remember where or when i got it, but i think it's a plan , not a mod...
---
The long bow mod can always be bought in watoga...
---
Heard rumors about a dual blad / bow mod  as well ?
---
I'm on Xbox one x. I do miss playing PlayStation but I love my new X
---
Fun fact. Shot guns crits count at 8... watoga has tons of passive robots to kill aswell.
---
Agreed.  I think there need to be more components, more possible angles and especially the ability to extend foundations or merge them particularly into rock.  A lot of 'dirt' in the world is actually not the terrain mesh that makes up the land.  That mesh is smooth, and its broken up by similarly textured 'objects' that are hard to tell apart.  That's why the rivers and creeks look nice...because of those objects.  Try to build a foundation on them and you get 'intersecting object.'  That limitation needs to be removed.
---
Another big one that need fixed is building on the square.  not everything should be at 90' angles, so the build engine should allow a bit more articulation otherwise the player built stuff will always look blocky/hokey.
---
So basically the Nuka Cola Workshop stuff from the FO4 Creation Club?
---
Space station?
---
There is an odd Sentry Robot silhouette in the Wastelanders last icon on the [road map](https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/fallout-76-roadmap-2019-full-year.png)...
---
3-5k seems the going rate on Xbox 
---
I think what we really need is a simple TCG like Gwent from Witcher or Triple Triad from FF8.
---
I‚Äôve always found that map interesting. I only just hit level 40 last night and have been playing a few months wandering around. 
---
I hung out in the forest but the quest line brought me to the Ash Heap pretty early on for the Fire Breathers. I was probably only level ~12 or so when I first entered there. I didn‚Äôt realize until later that I should go north.
---
Although the Ash Heap has some strong enemies I found myself having less trouble against the level 22 mole miners than I did the level 22 wendigos And super mutants I encountered In Divide. 
---
The scaling is interesting as the Ash Heap has a much lower cap, but higher valley than the other area which I think makes it pose much less of a threat than the entire eastern Half of the map.
---
I would love some camp games to destress from the horrors of the wasteland
---
Yeah, pretty much. 
---
There were constant waves of them, sometimes multiple using gamma guns in a wave.
---
What time will you be on?
---
Watoga would be good for this. It has:
---
2 level three safes, one in the wall of the building next to the transportation hub and one behind the counter of a rooftop bar.
---
2 plan and 2 recipe spawns, in a train car and a semi trailer, and in the diner and the high school roof.
---
2 mod spawns, a weapon one in the locked transportation hub room and a power armor one on the high school roof. (Got calibrated shocks here!)
---
2 bobbleheads, one in the comic shop on the counter and one behind the rooftop bar.
---
3 magazines, one by the corpse in the transportation hub elevator, one on a patio table halfway up to the rooftop bar, and one on a ledge behind a toilet on the high school roof.
---
All that, plus legendary robots that are easy kills. Am I leaving anything out?
---
all great points, i have no clue why you are being downvoted so much, you make clear points without bashing Bethesda
---
its sad that people would downvote any of this
---
Everyone overlooks the humble empty can.  They yield lead and steel.  Even aluminum cans have scapable lead.  Were there is one, there is usually more.
---
Additionally, with all the lead in children's toys and paint cans, once you begin picking these neglected resources,  you'll be flush in ammo.
---
I don‚Äôt see them on Xbox, just the name of the mod (when looking in the mods tab). Only seeing the description when you were about to apply the mod is kind of pointless, because how do I know I want to keep the mod, if I don‚Äôt happen to have the item against which the mod can be applied?
---
I had noticed that much later in the game. I never went to Grafton or anywhere North really till my 50s but I was stunned by the leveling. I was kinda like the story steers you South when North is almost he best place to go after leaving the vault. 
---
Lol I get you now kinda like the explosive vents , somebody forgot the close a code bracket probably.
---
Not on their defense but imagine you code 
---
( code whatever /code ) they must had forgotten to add the last bracket. Given the size of things easy to miss things like this ( they work but they don‚Äôt work as intended ) a few weeks ago nuka quantum granades were a mere purple fart now they work as intended.
---
Submit a support ticket trough their website or tag one of those Bethesda people.
---
I just went to watoga.
---
I'm looking for RPers.  I agree that it is difficult, but even a handful of people wishing to ham it up is exponentially better fun.
---
Are you on PC?  What are your preferences for RP?
---
You can find the stream on Bethesdas YouTube channel. It's good, you should watch it.
---
8pm EST! 
---
I did see it as I am subscribed to him but I feel Bethesda would not change any 76 system in a major way any time soon. that's why my suggestion is so simple. 
---
I feel if it looks and is simple for them to add there's more change they will
---
Nice, I'm going to have to try this run.
---
I haven‚Äôt found out how yet. Then again, I don‚Äôt play it as much. Should look into it once more. 
---
It‚Äôs the way you play the violin that matters, not its name.. Calling it ‚ÄúViolin‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you could not play country music or anything else less. :) 
---
Having an Alterac Valley or Arathi Basin style PVP would actually entice me into playing.
---
Is anyone still playing this game?
---
Shame I just vendored an instigating lvl 50 black powder pistol last night.  Would have gave it to you.
---
How hold on that's a whole different ball park.
---
yes but since you can open the frame nad it said standard frame I was convinced they would not just add a crossbow and not make it moddable.
---
I mean the whole reason for them must be since "crossbows of the Commonwealth" was so popular and a big part of that mod is all the different mods you can put on the crossbows
---
There is another mod that you can only get by scrapping it. I think it‚Äôs the bow mod
---
If you noticed, when you have Herbivore you still get benefit from Salsbury steak and CRAM. So this leads me to believe that all packaged food is made from fake meat so it's all vegan.
---
If I may suggest an expansion on this idea...
---
You can pay (caps for the current server or atoms for cross server) to send, not just messages, but ITEMS as well! For either, you can also purchase "protection"... a small squad of Colonel Gutsy's. When the target user logs in, the Messenger is then randomly spawned some distance from the target and has to navigate to the target, the whole while being vulnerable to attacks from other players.
---
Players who successfully kill the Messenger AND any protection get the message or item being delivered. As long as there is NO distiction between message and item Messengers, any player attacking them would have no idea what they might get.
---
Maybe even add an element of randomness. The Messengers could be randomly rigged to explode when opened by anyone other than their intended target, further adding to the risk/reward of other players attacking these Messengers.
---
Lastly, the server could spawn one or two of these Messengers (with and without protection) every hour or so, complete with the same random explosive, to help cammo any REAL delivery.
---
I think that would add a little more actual LIFE into the world... Messengers on a mission to deliver! A new Post Office location could be added with a quest line and events. Maybe it could even be suggested this is the precursor to the New Vegas couriers of which the player is a member.
---
Just random thoughts.
---
You quit and and start another game. Pretty simple. 
---
I'm going to use it for a new character to get them to 50 faster.
---
I swear rain only stays for like 30 seconds
---
Yes I play daily
---
How do you know what you don‚Äôt know?????????
---
If it were a game theory, it would be something stupid that you could easily prove to be wrong. There is some credibility to the Simulation theory lol
---
I'm of the opinion that creating several player hubs and introducing factions properly rather than just a bounce from one to the other through the main quest could make the social aspect of the game better. 
---
Yeah by the time I went North I had already gotten used to scrambling for my life at every turn. I have pretty mediocre gear and weapons as I don‚Äôt really go for a specific build, I‚Äôm kind of just the use what he finds and build it better when he can type of adventurer. 
---
Given that when I went north even at level 15-20 I found that everything I did was so much easier than it had been while I shotgunned mole miners in the face spamming the Stimpak button. 
---
I think going that route set me up for more success on the eastern half of the map. I am only just going to camp venture and if I wear PA I feel fairly safe against anything I encounter(given I have the opportunity to run away)
---
I have a ton of precious aid on me that i can't stash or lose. I just went to a indoor place were i never see people.
---
Watoga is like taking a walk in a mine field.
---
Just quit to the menu and then hit play again. 
---
I'm on PS4, though, and I have never once seen a server number higher than 2. Does that mean we only have three server hopping chances, max? Or will stuff reset when we log back in, even if it's to a server we've previously visited?
---
Not really as when you scroll over a mod you can add at the middle bottom of the screen it tells you if it has any other effects other than stats buffs
---
Face lighting.... First thing I turn off in fo4...
---
Just about everything else can be done/has been done in fo4 through mods, op should learn how to use the creation kit and wait for private servers.  Bethesda hasnt said a word about giving us text chat much less linking it to their lip sync and facial expression systems.  Nice wishlist though.
---
dont forget to block i guess
---
I can't do that, i only play Survival.
---
Yeah I was afraid too. Luckily i saw nobody for the 30mins i was there.
---
ESO does them fairly frequently.  It gets players to try new characters and builds. 
---
I would also like to know.
---
I think with the extra budget you should stock your shelves. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else do this besides me, but it makes a shop look a lot less empty. Just place random small items anywhere on the shelves. The top and bottom shelves work best but signs and other things can go on the middle shelves too. I use floor items, signs, other decorations, lamps, boxes, even some small benches. Here‚Äôs a preview of what I‚Äôm talking about: https://gfycat.com/testyinconsequentialelephant-136077d1-0579-4a05-94f2-4c0bf5c2ec05
---
I just datamined the ESMs to figure out what I had versus what was left to learn, but I assumed that was because I'm more comfortable reading code than tutorials. Now that you mention it though, that *is* pretty godawful. Definitely not fun. Even if learning a mod is a random chance, past a point you're just throwing weapons into the grinder with no real expectation of reward. If you knew there was something you *might* learn then it would make it more rewarding.
---
I HIGHLY doubt that Beth is hoping for an e-sports version of Fallout.
---
As for the whole introvert thing... I have played hundreds of hours of ESO and never partied up. I have never grouped in this game either, and have felt zero pressure to do so.
---
Thank you, yes this seems like confirmation bias. I think at most the data is useful only for demonstrating that 2 and 3 star drops are rare even from 3 star legendaries. Anything else is either clearly RNG and/or too little power to make conclusions.
---
I think it does.  But you might as well take the xp from the super mutants.  You just can‚Äôt kill the turrets so you can just sit next to one and build up the crit meter over and over.
---
You are incorrect, there is a chest armor mod.
---
you da man
---
Or after you know all the mods, if you tear down, you could randomly get one of the mods off the teardown instead of raw components.  
---
I mean it may be better if you got exp from scrapping weapons as well as scrap so even if you don't learn a mod you get exp based on weapon level
---
Oh trust me I plan to do this when they implement being able to place junk in your base. Have a full stash just begging to be placed.
---
Thank you üôè 
---
I currently run all 3 gladiator perks, martial artist, and incisor. 
---
Bloody Mess, Radicool, and Nerd Rage all augment my damage as well. 
---
Bloodied Shishkebab + Adrenal Reaction Mutation stack too. 
---
Also, I use weapon artisan to repair the weapon above 100%, which gives a huge damage boost for melee weapons. 
---
I have completed Watoga mayor event and robots are still hostile. Do I need to do something in addition to that?
---
How the hell does the Crossbow not have mods? 
---
Make Deathclaws Great Again!
---
Gotcha, I think that‚Äôs most peoples idea. Just trying to get the info out that it can look stocked even before that update. 
---
This so much. They really didnt think about so many aspects of UX.
---
Definitely running a bloodied build (almost surely a 3 star legendary on that shishkebob). Would like to see his/her build and armor as well. Probably unyielding on the armor, otherwise bloodied build is super glass cannon-y. Hope the OP enlightens us.
---
the best 360 vats no scope\*
---
i play like newbie i never block, maybe this weapon can teach to be more professional lol
---
The Wendigo cave?
---
Awww wish this weekend was for adventure too but i guess they need to get people into survival somehow to test it. 
---
I honestly thought when they added that Assualtron waifu to the preview toons that meant we'd have robo companions we could build ourselves. But then of course they didn't, and I was sad.
---
But now when I look at the Fall 2019 Wastelanders DLC preview there's [a little silhouette mini bot](https://i.imgur.com/unmTjkv.png) with like little protectron feet and a little handy head so I'm thinking we _may_ be able to make our own mini bots that can carry 50 pounds and annoy bad guys when we don't want them to. Or not. We'll see.
---
I refuse to believe this game was extensively tested before release. 
---
I don't think esports are coming to fallout anytime soon. 
---
I also play solo almost exclusively. You can solo all content in the game right now. That might change in upcoming raids, but even if you're grouped up it's not like you have to be chatty. 
---
As for survival, now that they fixed spawn camping you should really try it out. It's not some battle royale. In fact, in survival most players have zero player kills. 
---
i thought he was asking about a perk for it. its what i get for reading reddit when i first wake up
---
I‚Äôm lvl 78 currently with a Unyielding/Bloodied/Radicool/melee build. Basically I‚Äôm OP as fuck and two hit scorchbeasts if I can out last them long enough for them to land. I currently have a bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet that does 997Dmg, and I don‚Äôt even have all my cards I use maxed so that‚Äôs not even max damage of what I‚Äôll eventually do But I digress, I use to be that way about venturing off without power armor. But my build doesn‚Äôt allow me to use power armor anymoreüò¢
---
I have a X01 Nuka Quantum set and Excavator armor just wasting space in my stash box currently.
---
Upvote for visibility. I need this info.
---
I‚Äôll be using reddit for pricing, I‚Äôll be selling everything you could possibly imagine since I‚Äôm a hoarder, and caps only for the most part. 
---
Rad storms too. Not to mention I've only seen a rad storm a handful of times.
---
I honestly love the game, got mates who only talk shit about it and have never played and always do my best to defend the game when I can
---
Yeah literally went through a 3rd of Wes Tek and did the challenge in like 15 minutes because of this perk.  Def use it.
---
OP will, but OP needs to know what "Private Servers" will consist of first.  I worked a lot in Second Life and Open Simulator and can't wait to mod...if it will have that ability.  The face lighting is only for social situations to fix the bad interior lighting on the avatars...they look washed out and greasy.  The problem is that cinematic lighting needs 3 lights to look good (key, back and fill.)  I'm very much aware this is a 'wishlist', but if it doesn't get written down then how can it ever have a chance of getting implemented?  I'd be happy with just some basic mouth movement when speaking to begin with.
---
I have to vote against darker nights. It's hard enough finding where the bodies dropped already. Plus, it feels like it's always night somehow when I play.
---
Additionally, you can put posters in the window to make it seem as though there‚Äôs nothing behind it. Leave just a slither of space so you can still select the crafting bench and be teleported inside. The guy that made the Taco Bell camp had a secret mothman shrine accessible this way. 
---
Happened to me. I moved the camp piece about 4 feet (kept fiddling until it went green) and was able to place the entire thing as if it never happened. Best of luck
---
glad others see the need!!!  
---
Nah I appreciate it cause that place is dope. Is it your own?
---
I couldn't believe it when I hit that cave cricket with a 95% hit chance and the smoke cleared and he came hopping out with 100% health.  Tried again and died because there was apparently a tree branch in front of me. 3rd try and the cricket once again came out without a scratch.
---
Went to Watoga municipal center roof and locked onto a bot across the way. 4 nukes 95% hit chance....... nothing not a lick of damage.
---
Went to the roof of West Tek. Maybe my target isn't taking damage but surely everyone around him will. Fired 3 nukes into a mob of mutants........they didn't even know I was there they just kept walking around as if nothing happened at full health.
---
It's amazing that they would offer a weapon that doesn't work as a reward for survival mode. 
---
Hmü§î tbh I‚Äôm not sure. That‚Äôs quite odd. They stopped attacking me after I did mine and didn‚Äôt even realize that was why till later a video on YouTube popped up in my recommended about it. As much as I enjoy the game, it‚Äôs still very buggy from time to time and you could be suffering from one. Hell, I can‚Äôt even play without plugging in a headset, otherwise I get NO audio at all from the game. 
---
There really should be some page accessible in-game that just lists every single event currently active along with what stage the event is at and how much time remains to complete it. The number of times I've teleported to Lode Baring or Uranium Fever with only 60 seconds remaining to finish the event are unacceptable.
---
That would have been great
---
I only keep what I consider to be "sellable" legendaries. Basically if its 1 star its gotta be something good; a to armor, instigating, two shot...if it's a 1 star junkies weapon...I'm tossing it. Big ticket items are the TSE,AAE,IE,BE weapons and all the sent/cav armors.
---
I also slang chems but dont tell anyone! Here is the price list I use (I made it myself based on how useful they are and what I've seen them go for. The idea is to be cheaper than vendors. I do discounts on orders over 10 chems):
---
Antibiotics: 15caps
---
Berry mentats: 13caps
---
Buffout: 8caps
---
Bufftats: 10caps
---
Calmex: 20caps
---
Daddy-O: 10caps
---
Day Tripper: 8caps
---
Fury: 12 caps
---
Grape mentats: 17caps
---
Med-x: 8caps
---
Mentats: 7caps
---
Orange mentats: 8caps
---
Overdrive: 15caps
---
Psycho: 11caps
---
Psychobuff: 16caps
---
Psychotats: 14caps
---
Rad-x: 7caps
---
Rad-x diluted: 4caps
---
Radaway: 10caps
---
Radaway diluted: 6caps
---
X-cell: 20caps
---
Water: 2 caps
---
I‚Äôve only done trades for caps my self. I will also be checking reddit for general prices or possibly cutting prices down to get rid of stuff. Should be interesting to say the least!
---
From the Atomic Shop Post: " These sales begin today, so head in-game to pick up anything that  catches your eye, because these items will only be available until each  sale ends on the dates listed below. " Unless they say otherwise, the language implies permanent removal.
---
Why? If you already have a character at 50 you can change their look and loadout and have a different character.   
---
If you wanna play the game again almost all the content is low level and there is like. zero high level quests or story things. 
---
A 40ft tall deathclaw !!! Lol
---
But ya they need more team base require enemies like the queen. Something to require nukes, since SBQ and whitespring is kinda stale at this point.  
---
Maybe a mission event that require a nuke to active it and spawn a random frightful high tier creature!!
---
(Spoiler) Well I imagined it kinda like the ‚Äúblackout‚Äù at the end of sampling Nukashine for the first time wherein you pass out at both beginning and end of the beverage.  In between you have no ability to interact with the environment other than having an truly enormous amount of unarmed DMG.  With no pip boy available either that means no armor, aid, etc...it only lasts 10 minutes.
---
How about being able to flag 'toggle autoscrap' on something.
---
Yep. Aggravating as shit
---
This could be something they add like player vending - player radio stations.
---
Capture a radio tower through a quest, upload your playlist and it lasts a while.
---
While possible, the program limit issue seems unlikely to me, because it implies we should be seeing more stuff leaving before new stuff is purchased. They are culling items, but not consistently with the additions.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Don't forget the fatman you launch at your feet when you're at low health and in Power Armor.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the shop I‚Äôve got up and running currently, Hog Heaven. Been messing with interior/exterior designs for a while now and finally combined a bunch of ideas into this shop. Big half circle interior, vendor window with siren, radio, and mothman statue accessibility. All workbenches. A restorative customer bathroom with decon shower. And a small living area for when the business is slow. 
---
What are you using ?
---
Daisy cutter with MIRV?
---
Or Fatman MIRV ?
---
Ive got a 78 and a 118..Im saving my 3rd run for when my friend starts so i can do a shitty full charisma/luck build for funsies. Even if i could get that friend to play this or next week id probably tell him to wait till after double exp bonus. Getting to 50 the first time is one of the funnest parts of this game right now accelerating it any faster than it already is would be criminal. 
---
I have no idea but I'm sure the market will figure itself out.
---
I'm more interested in _where_ our shops will be. I mean I love my CAMP in the middle of nowhere but if I'm going to sell my junk I can't just hope someone wandering around the hills north of Huntersville is in a buying mood. I'm curious if there's a place where the game will let us build that can become a de facto bazaar for all the vendors. I want to say the tracks near Whitespring station but there's no way if everyone builds there that you'll ever be able to put your CAMP in the same spot.
---
Imagine a giant mole rat with a nuclear steroid injection 
---
would definitely love some transparency on this issue
---
I was being sarcastic. 
---
I just want a keypad door that I can open from the INSIDE. 
---
On pc during the event i came across quit a few familiar faces while server hoping. There can't be that many players to begin with. 
---
Probably a combo of the two shot and the beam splitter. Both tend to increase damage to weapons individually, adding them together on the same weapon would increase the speed that your weapon breaks even further.
---
Thank you for this
---
I buy the hunters long coat for 800 and sell for 1200.  I think that's fair, may even increase the price a bit.   I had requests to buy my Fasnacht beret, but they don't ever like my 1800 price tag. Lowest I'd go on it is 1500. 
---
Rare? I got them 3 times already from forbidden knowledge....been giving them away lol
---
Shit that be hilarious and I would love it!!! It would make for a great event. Never knowing what the boss creature will be till ure in the fight!!
---
Could even be a giant glowing disease chicken!!!
---
yes please can we know what we have to work with in numbers WITHOUT having to use mods or guess or work around or all of that mess.
---
Two shot + beam splitter
---
That's 8 bullet per trigger. What do you expect? 
---
Xbox
---
I would like ballisticvore, so I can eat all my excess .38 ammo.  Also, when people shoot me, I get healed instead of wounded.
---
Well if you noticed my ingredients list I gave most of the fictional cocktails an ingredient that is difficult to acquire or craft, so long as it‚Äôs not a weekly challenge I think 80 atoms just to craft 1 Deathclaw Island Iced tea and drink it would be fair, I deliberately make that ones ingredients very difficult so that there aren‚Äôt thousands of Deathclaw characters running around at all times
---
üòâü§ôüèª
---
You tried putting the bashing stock on it and repairing it to 200%
---
Honestly I really just carry my armor around with me and I put it in when I come across something huge or radioactive( or I run out of carry weight). 
---
It seems a little op for me to just run around in it constantly. 
---
Also I have a slightly older tv so the screen isn‚Äôt adjust to my size and when I wear PA it pushes a lot of the HUD out to the edges I can‚Äôt see anymore.
---
This is the only game over ever played that didn‚Äôt  allow me to adjust the screen borders. Anthem didn‚Äôt have that to start but out it in right away after. Has 76 done this yet and I‚Äôve just missed it or are they just ignoring that?
---
Protesting the fix done several updates ago?
---
Or a miner's helmet for directional light.
---
Personally, the thing that gets me the most is the bug where my character gets locked up and I can't do melee at all until I switch to a gun and back.  That's been broken for far too long.
---
I found a 3* Furious Fatman with 50% VATS criticals and 90% reduced weight.
---
I was disappointed with the Furious modifier until I remembered about the MIRV attachment and so I went on a hunt for the mod. Needless to say I am extremely disappointed that the MIRV seems to be broken (in VATS at least) because I was hoping for the possibility that each nuke from the MIRV would count as independent hits towards the Furious legendary effect.
---
I always repair to 200%. Bashing stock increases durability?
---
I‚Äôll hop on to survival for this, but better believe once I reach the top 3 I‚Äôm jumping off my CAMPs ‚Äòsucicide tower‚Äô so I don‚Äôt get constantly hunted by some jackoff 
---
Happy to help but not online atm. Add me, but could be a couple of hours.
---
Have a look at the condition bar when you go to apply the mod. The size increases by about 30%
---
But it's still 40x less durable than my other TSE guns.
---
Gotta say, this is the first "Roundup" I've seen that has all the relevant data points (and glancing at the comments, I can see that others are reading them too). And is it me, or did you upgrade your formatting game? Either way, interesting post, well presented, and at least informative in regards to drop chances. Thank you for it.
---
Totally agree. This is a different game from launch. The best part...the people who stuck around truly love it so our community is top notch. 
---
Personally, I'm going to sell everything fairly cheap. I am near the 25,000 cap limit most of the time, so there's just no point in charging a lot. This is just for fun.
---
I want to charge just enough to discourage a single player from buying out all the good stuff just to resell. I can't envision charging more than 1000 caps for anything, and that would be for something good like a calibrated shocks mod.
---
I think ammo values are going to be important, and I think being able to use them in addition to caps would be ideal. I would accept ammo over caps in many circumstances, the only issue would be big ticket items due to the ammo weight.
---
I typically see most ammo go for .5 caps each round, more for 2mm electromag and explosives. That said, I'd probably accept ammo I use as caps and a 1:1 ratio.
---
Right on I'll add you , I'll be around for a few hours just jump on this thread when your ready. Is your name the same ?
---
I don‚Äôt have herbivore or carnivore either so never knew that, it‚Äôs true what they say... you learn something new everyday 
---
I would enjoy being able to tag events that I enjoy doing to show up on my hub like Fastnark did. Please
---
They prolly don‚Äôt and sadly, prolly never will. I remember on my old TV which was like 38‚Äù HD 1080p, Skyrim Special Edition was messed up like that. When I got my new 4K TV in December which is a 42‚Äù I no longer had those border issues. 
---
If it works the way they said your camp will be marked as a vendor on the map, so that won‚Äôt be an issue.
---
I went into this game as someone who had played single player games almost exclusively.  I went in with the intent of playing solo but at the same time, I am the kind of guy who wants to experience every aspect of any game  I play. 
---
So while not going out of my way to team up, I was willing to accept team invites if I got them and give the multiplayer aspect a shot. 
---
So I guess my advice would be don't commit to any one play style.   Play solo, but  play with others when given the chance. 
---
I‚Äôve been pondering placement too. I had a shop right by the Helvetia church during Fasnacht and that brought in so much business. I‚Äôve since relocated just north of the Whitespring station (on the road since it‚Äôs a nice flat spot to build on). I‚Äôve seen a lot of people at the station since moving here, but very few wonder down the road. A more ideal spot would be right between the station and the mine, because it would visible as soon as people spawned into the station. I also considered Lewisburg because of the sheepsquatch quest launching there supposedly. There‚Äôs a nice lake by the train station to build on. 
---
Yep, same IGN 
---
Is there pink power armor paint? If not you could try for carbon fiber, black bird with the wet suit. Or low rider , one of the blues with the checked shirt.
---
Darker nights? Maybe if night didn‚Äôt encompass 22 out of 24 hours. 
---
What's the difference between a violin and a fiddle?
---
A violin has strings, and a fiddle has *strangs*!
---
I'll show myself out... 
---
If you are on Xbox, I love you.
---
Camps are going to become immune? 
---
Not on Xbox but I love you anyway haha
---
I feel like everything cool happens when I‚Äôm going on trips. At least there‚Äôs still a second weekend.
---
TL:DR Answer: Camps, turrets, and other buildables do not take damage sitting in nuke zones.  
---
Someone brought out the SB Queen while I was on so warped down to try it out. I had 6 MG turrets, 3 HMGs, and a spotlight (since it looks like the cap of turrets is now 10) but it looks like turrets got a nerf?!? MGs were lvl 4 and HMGs were 15, so not sure if they were damaging the Queen at all...but they do help with all the ads so that players can focus more on the Queen.
---
Probably shouldn‚Äôt do this with rockets as that will splash other players...but now that slap damage has been removed, would that matter anymore? 
---
Yeah, just an example of why people would keep stuff in thier inventory instead of the stash.
---
They say they are working on it, to be implemented in a future patch. If you are pacifist, camp is immune to player damage. It is to counter the griefers that still hang around even though they were given their own little litterbox to play in.
---
No luck on the dodgy testing. In all the perk packs I opened through level 138, I guess I never got one. I probably won't be able to test it for you for a while as you've poked a few holes in my build and I am really considering dropping luck of the draw for more adrenaline.
---
I had a similar situation the other day. I logged in, and there were 3 other players. I checked again about 5-10 minutes later, and they had left. But nobody else ever logged in.
---
Thanks for pointing this out, even with this small sample size I see no reason to believe inventory or stash effects drops.
---
Agreed. First hit is totally broken. Makes PvP impossible 
---
I feel as though the initial salt kept most of the usual trolls and deplorables away, while the Fallout fans gave it an honest try.
---
It may explain why the online adventure community is so (generally speaking) friendly.
---
I think they made a good game, I really do. 
---
Npt gonna lie, when I first went there, I was more scared of the level 20+ mutants.
---
Especially since there were factors we weren't told and the white springs remains a no fly zone.
---
Try moving your CAMP just a bit and that should store all your items.  Should be able to just shift it slightly. 
---
I'm Ok with that, maybe I don't spend enough time in WS but I have only seen a couple camps built directly behind the club. 
---
move your camp
---
Make sure you don‚Äôt have things in stored or things that are in blueprints need to be scrapped.  Obviously things you‚Äôre not using. You‚Äôre probably at max 
---
the plans cost 9800 to 11000 from vendors, i doubt you will find anyone selling it that cheap.
---
I have 50% more to build and this thing is like rock frozen 
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. 
---
Gamer son arms, we rise up!
---
I don‚Äôt think it ‚Äúloses‚Äù it just empties the clip and you have to reload.  Bug introduced in patch 7. 
---
  if you go back to the screen that shows all categories and the cards you have placed in them, one (or more) of the columns should have yellow text in the top to the efect of "X pts Unused"
---
Whatever that category is, you can select and assign a card from those available to you, IF that card has a number =&lt; the number in yellow.
---
Alternately, you can leave the point available for later, and backfill when you get a perk card you want, then assign it to the approriate category.
---
At L50 and later, you will be given a choice to:
---
1a. select a card from the deck (to fill out those unused points)
---
1b. assign that card to an unused point in the appropriate category.
---
or 
---
1b. select  a new perk card in any category to swap out for one you already 
---
 assigned in the same category
---
2a. move a point from one perk category to another.
---
2b.  swap available cards to utilize the point in the new category.
---
  I ran for 15+ levels with 3 unused points in strength before I was able to use option 1a and 1b to put perks against the avallable S points.
---
I'm going to undercut you all, mwhahaha.
---
Killing the queen isn't about loot. It's about destroying an abomination and freeing Appalachia from the queen's reign of terror. Ad Victoriam.
---
I saw you have Antibiotics @ 15... Do you think Cure Disease @ 25 is not unreasonable?
---
I don‚Äôt see this. I‚Äôll look again.
---
The trainyard east of watoga station has 5 safes. 2 are alwasys level 3 and the others are level 2. Occasionally a 3\* Legendary will be there as well.
---
There's a perk for that.
---
Pvp could be in Overall more fun if those Factions already in existence, would actually ''hate'' each other and u can join them like in every other fallout game.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the ammo is being lost but I‚Äôve started to make sure I switch to my super sledge before logging out ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I don‚Äôt have trades but I‚Äôll buy any pieces off of you :/
---
What‚Äôs the perk? 
---
I am sure someone loves you for doing that. Most definitely.  I do the same thing.
---
Yes
---
But what‚Äôs changed in the last week? 
---
Have a completely different build on demand...
---
Yes we can swap out perk cards, but unless you have a shitload of level ups banked, you cannot change your SPECIAL. Think about it for a sec and you'll understand.
---
On my 4th playthrough of 4 I did a vegan straightedge challenge:  no meat, no leather armor, no unprovoked animal attacks, and no chems.  In survival.  In fact, chems had to be dumped in the river when found, except rad x, Radaway, and stimpacks. 
---
It was very difficult.  I dont think I ever finished it. 
---
I thought there was but I could be mistaken
---
There‚Äôs a weird thing where you can‚Äôt build. Getting out of building completely and going back in fixes that. When you select build and look at your circle is there any place else you can put it?
---
Me too
---
Power user.
---
Almost every time I spawn in, my weapons are empty and I have to manually reload. It sucks when I spawn into a fight, and am basically unarmed
---
It's the brotherhood's duty to make sure dangerous technology doesn't fall into the wrong hand's.  
---
I heard that people sell it for around 1000 caps.
---
Insult Bot is already in the game
---
I dunno. Just offering a fix.
---
Other than the 2nd head I assume?
---
There was back in FO4 but I haven't seen it yet 
---
It was there since patch 5.
---
If they are hoping for esports, they are going to be very disappointed. FO76 pvp is the polar opposite of esports. 
---
Under Intelligence.
---
Whenever the camp is green it just says it is ‚Äúfloating‚Äù I‚Äôve tried multiple ways to put it back down. 
---
Happens when you are moving while waving. I've been having fun with it for a few weeks.
---
Wow. I have never seen that.
---
I think so but only based on the fact that antibiotics uses a stimpack in the recipe to make aswell as antiseptic whereas the disease cure is various plants that are available in abundance, I will be selling disease cures as they are heavily used in game by everyone high or low level I think a reasonable price for them would be 5 to 10caps each if your not wanting to do the legwork of picking the ingredients :)
---
Consider those others who picked them up, sold them to a vendor, which may or may not have been purchased by another player, dropped on the floor, scrapped, given to someone who stopped playing or doesn't realize it can have more value.. the prices and rarity will only go up.
---
Back when duping was around I think it was. 
---
I am avoiding Survival because of the top 3 map locations. The time alive metric is a good idea in theory, but in practice it is unfair. A vague area on the map or slowing down the refresh rate of the top 3's position on the map would get me to dive in.
---
Also, allowing the same characters to be used has meant that all of the duped weapons out there are still in play, leading to a situation of haves and have nots. Weapon damage normalisation is there, but it is still unbalanced.
---
I imagine many others feel the same.
---
Wander around the North Eastern side of the Grafton area. You'll find it.
---
Been wondering the same thing. I have sold a ton of legendaries and outfits to vendors, not realizing how much I've missed out on...
---
NERF THIS
---
I camp way out in the boonies and almost never see a player in adventure mode, so sometimes I hop onto survival just for the xp since I know there's almost no chance of anyone finding me.
---
Ive seen it I believe it only does it in power armor and its weird its not a wave gesture either I think its a bugged animation
---
_Maybe._ But wouldn't it be better if the community came together organically and decided on a central place where all the vendors are? I mean in a couple of weeks we're going to have central vending at the Whitespring so we don't have to roam the entire map to sell our junk. Why not central player vending by the train station to avoid the same scenario the gamemakers are trying to solve: Not having to run around the whole goddamn map just to buy and sell cool stuff.
---
I'm sorry
---
Could just be the cores your picking up. A few updates back they changed it so the game will prioritize the core with the least amount of charge to be used first. If you've picked up a bunch of minimally charged cores it can feel like you're burning through them faster, but in reality it's because the weak ones are being loaded first.
---
Basically my train of thought haha
---
Lmao, it almost looks like a gesture Picard makes in Star Trek
---
Pipe revolvers benefit from both rifleman and pistol perks depending on the weapon build, as far as I can tell, so they're a strong backup for medium range/sniping. Cheap ammo and cheap repairs too.
---
I feel like that's fair. It's super important when you need it!
---
The fallout 76 market on reddit is where I'll get my prices.
---
Look for my camp for chems, healing items and crafting mats.  I horde adhesive and I need a good way to make a profit off of it.
---
All my energy weapons break faster.  I swear gunsmith doesn‚Äôt work on energy weapons.  But I don‚Äôt think many agree with that notion.  
---
XD It actually kinda does
---
Hey! Add me too. :D  
---
 id is ZacCasablancas
---
It would be great if they made it so you could change the colors and the pipboy light should have a slider on it's own, and to add to this I would love to have everything colorful and not just stick to one color.  there are mods that do this for fallout 4 so it can be done.
---
you can make whatever new build you want in far far less time then running through the whole game again.
---
exactly, if you are in the raiders then everyone sees you as hostile all the time. if you are in the responders then not so much. and so on. you can have rivalries where the vender bots wont serve you if your factions reputation is too low (so if you're making war on members of that faction your rep goes down, doing quests for them improves it etc.)   
---
I'm hoping this is what the wastelanders dlc is about. 
---
The wood trap launch can send you across the map if you have a jet pack and bird bones on a clif
---
I have high charisma due to wearing Unyeilding armor and hard bargain maxed out and also use a combo of mothman eggs and beer to top up buffs on charisma when I do my vendor runs, I will be basing my prices on the max amount I can get from a vendor, for example I can sell a stimpack for a max of 10 caps so my price will be just over this maybe 15 caps so that it's still reasonably priced but to prevent players emptying my machines then selling them to vendors for a profit margin.
---
It would be kind of cool if after a radstorm your Brahmin became a glowing Brahmin for a little while, and the milk she gives during that time had an extra buff.
---
1. Place camp on an acid node. (*Note. There is an acid node and a lead node in build able range of each other

https://fo76map.com?locationIds=2209
---
But it's next to a fissure)
---
2. As others have said lucky hole mine, fire departments, the pen, and other locations.
---
3. This can take some work. Run summersville, new glad, Wade airport, for the muties/scorched and scrap all weapons ( one run with scrapper usually is close to 600 steel)
---
4.when refining use chemist + supper dupper. When crafting. Ammosmith + supper dupper.
---
In 35-40 min of work I usually net close to 900 lead, and 900 steel. And since I use 5.56,45,.50,2mm and 5mm for my weapons I stay ahead of my ammo use pretty easy unless I multiple scorched Earth runs.
---
It generally goes for 4k-5k from what i have seen
---
I put Radaway in my favorites wheel for this very issue, keeping popping pills until the game loads enough where you can finally get into your armor (why the heck isn't this a favoriteable item yet?) or get out of the zone. 
---
never seen it for that much myself. maybe try 76market or 76bazaar I can never remember what the trading reddit is called.
---
Hope he didn't bail on that bag.
---
F
---
If I stumble on those cards before you I will let you know!
---
I sold one on PC for 4k yesterday within 10 minutes of posting.
---
Yeah that weapon I was so excited I got one as a drop it looked so cool but that damage was ugh 
---
Can you imagine how crowded it would be if everyone and their dog had to put up shop or build in one spot? Maybe since the server can only have 24 people at once or whatever, they could have a bank of 24 vending machines in one spot, but otherwise having 24 camps that have to be near Whitesprings? No way. We‚Äôll just have to wait and see, and hopefully they get it right, or at least close.
---
Sounds really fun, and I have a Fallout 4 build that does this.  What isn't fun is trying to find the bodies when they go flying.
---
Yes but then you can't switch back to your old build without doing it again...
---
Lol na stay wight hear naw.
---
If they are there for support, they are fine. Craft stations, stash, rad arch, etc. but many put them there with rocket turrets to spam the clubhouse. blows the loot all to hell, steals all the kills, and lags everyone out. Total dick move by selfish people.  
---
Those camps need to be banned or remain destroyable.
---
With any other business. Go off supply and demand.  Basic economics.  
---
Price it. And if too many people buying too fast then maybe increase.  Or if no one is buying ever then decrease price.  
---
There is some guns i would pay way more than what is being offered.  And same with I wouldn‚Äôt pay that much for certain weapons. 
---
It varies by player and their respectable RNG experience they have. 
---
For instance I found 9 legendaries last night at watoga in just one loop around the place. 5 minutes and I had 1 3*, 3 2*, and 5 1* legendaries.  Where other people may not have this luck and therefore willing to pay more 
---
Lol you got me! :) 
---
Probably some nonsense reason about it being online. I used to make mine gray so it looked like an old TV, or red if I was a raider.
---
Trade you my 3 star vampire Mr. Handy for it. Lol.
---
I did this, there are some websites you can buy keys from, most of them aren't GREAT deals though. So maybe you could find it for 40 bucks or something. One thing to note though, is that the game is region locked so if you're from US, make sure you get a copy that is for North America and not like, Europe or Asia or whatever. Otherwise you might be SOL.
---
Once you have two copies though, you can launch one game regularly through your Bethesda launcher.
---
For the second instance of the game, go directly to your install folder and click on the EXE for the game. Unlike the Bethesda one where you can save your credentials and be auto-logged in, the second instance you'll have to manually type in your username and password.
---
Then you can send yourself a friend request from one account to the other, and bam, instant mule access.
---
I agree. I just wonder why they aren‚Äôt effected at all. 
---
I think I see both points.   
---
I might just go to 20 caps on them because of the leg work of getting the supplies. I was doing Savage Divide Cure Disease. Trying to find re-zen was tiresome.   
---
u/slicknilla - Thinking about it you might be under selling yourself on the Antibiotics. Antibiotics has a % of keeping a disease away.   
---
Always thanks for your time. 
---
I went crazy over this for a while in the beginning.
---
There are .50 Cal mods for the hunting rifle. I know to of them. One through breaking things down and one as a random drop.
---
For some reason a hardened .308 does more flat damage than a regular .50 cal, so I'm HOPING a hardened .50 cal will do even more damage, but after breaking down hundreds of hunting rifles I still don't have the plans, and I don't even know if they exist.
---
Great job. I have been thinking that not legendary effects have the same chance of dropping. I think there is a common, uncommon and rare effect pool and that influences what is dropped. 
---
Totally agree, I spent hundreds of mats trying to get mods for the 10mm smg.
---
easiest way is to have a friend that you can either trade with to move stuff over to an alt or so you can drop stuff into a container (the suitcases or such dotted around) then use your friend to bring your alt to the same server.
---
(note you cant just drop because paper bags vanish when you log out from what I have been told)
---
Logging into a nuked zone does suck for those of us that don't use PA but logging in seconds before a nuke hits...priceless!
---
Thanks so much for clarifying this.
---
Appreciate you took the time to answer
---
I play Friday the 13th where you have several kill animations seen both by the killer and by the players so it is doable. I'd love the executions to come back. Without them the combat is dull and less rewarding. It's bad enough that we can't have bullet cam anymore :/
---
I'll be selling the random power armor pieces that I find on my runs that I dont need for a set.  20caps, regardless of level, type, or durability.  This can also include 200% parts that are extra from super-duper. My store will be an AtomCats scrap yard basically
---
im sure they wont have it be able to get in game, but bought on the atom store
---
;-)
---
I want some real gorillas in the mire inhabiting all the huge trees.
---
I am also melee but have combined this with rifleman and shotgun so I can swap between three builds..when you say disadvantaged, in what way? 
---
what frame did you use?
---
Thank you! 
---
Paint for metal armor, not power armor. 
---
Saw some posts including these, but I'll just give directions to all of them so it's easier for me to explain and to help confirm the previous posts for the locations.
---
The 5 stealth boys I farm daily.
---
Pleasant valley ski resort, if you spawn at the train station and head up the cliff to the front entrance you'll see it behind the fest on a conveyer belt. Go to the bot vendor in Same building, there is a office across the hall on the desk directly left of the door. Leave the building and head north. You'll get to the road that has the arena.
---
 Heading down the road with the raider arena on your left and raider shops on the right there is a shop with metal shelves, look for the green footlocker box at the bottom of the shelves, stealth boy is next to it. Keep going down the same road, it forks at a cliff, at the top of the cliff is a boat. Stealth boy is in the boat. At the bottom of the cliff is some more metal shelves with the last stealth boy
---
I was hoping that all of that area would be non build able after the last patch. I agree with you on the matter. Guess we'll just have to wait and see what Bethesda does. 
---
That isn't quite as much of a problem as you'd think - and I do try to be a bit situationally aware. If I see legendaries I maybe won't bomb them while they are near a car that'll blow up second and disperse them. Then again, maybe I will. 
---
For fun you can give your mule the Empath mutation and then team up with it for a nice 25% damage reduction.
---
If you actually go into the shop, and in the featured tab there's the "Leaving Soon!" picture, and above that picture is a description reading "These items are heading back into the Vault; get them before they're gone!" So, no, it's not a permanent removal, and I believe the previous round of these clearly stated that they just leaving "for now". It would be asinine to straight up remove content. They're not that stupid. 
---
&gt; While it is possible they plan on bringing the items back later, the language as stated is that the items will not be available, so they will not be returning.
---
Well, sure, if you want to interpret that as pessimistically as possible.
---
I personally don't server hop, since XP buffs disappear. I just think the build zone being so close is a nuisance for people who actually put time and effort into getting geared up. While it's not "wrong" to farm with turrets, a lot of people disagree with it and have had an issue with it since forever, and threads like mine were almost daily.
---
With new content getting dropped I suppose we temporarily have other things to focus on, but when you're faaaar into the endgame and it's impeding on farming - what's pretty much all my gameplay at this point - it's obvious and annoying. Can I live with it? Sure, it's not high priority. But it would be nice since we've been getting a lot more *no build zone* areas flagged anyway for future content, why not just fix this while we're at it?
---
My last visit (only level 59) I encountered a level 70 something chameleon deathclaw. As soon as I took my first shot at it, it turned and ran away. I ended up running back and forth across whitesprings chasing it with a 50 cal in my PA trying to hit it. It ducked around a corner once and as soon as it was out of sight it hid in a bush until I found it again.
---
There was a lower level player watching me...must have looked strange to him watching me running back and forth chasing a deathclaw. Could really have used the Benny Hill soundtrack.
---
If you're not wanting explosive heavy guns due to the Heavy Gunner Perks, they still work with weapons that are explosive from being legendary, also Demo Expert will work as well.  With all of them on my TSE Gatling Gun deals just over 200 damage per shot.
---
Well thanks freaking genius lol.  Then share strange in numbers 
---
Burning beasts pvp certain events that you need a rifle, and I notice that you do a lot of damage ...
---
Whats the best non nuke xp farming method?
---
For which picture?
---
I earned from 90% other players and 10% mobs that were in my way.
---
Happy to help
---
Yes, Bethesda has said they would be making it to where CAMPs take no damage unless you are in combat (PVP) with the other player.
---
This will only apply to Adventure mode.
---
Yeah I need this. I need to figure out what I don‚Äôt know so I can search/plan/loot better. 
---
Are you looking for the key in the locker? If so, it‚Äôs not there anymore and was probably a bug to begin with. 
---
Yeah well i wouldnt mind if that happens 
---
Dear Bethesda, Keep adding little crap and ignore the big stuff. Thank you, Everyone
---
Yes how much
---
I just switch to a different game and it closes fallout 76 completely. Not saying that's the best way, that's just what I do.
---
I think the mods should be shown and greyed out until known, maybe even have unknown next to them. Least then we would have a clue to tracking the mods down. I search every vendor every time I log in and have still not found reactive plates or the jet pack mods for the x01 power armor. 
---
He is correct. I have a rifle, gatling gun build on one character and a melee pistol build on the other. To switch would cost me 14 levels each swap so 2 characters in the long run is much must faster, and now i can dedicate to min maxing the two separate heroes
---
For my ‚Äúshop‚Äù at least, rare plans will never pass 1500.
---
I‚Äôm talking stupidly rare drops.  
---
Keep you‚Äôre prices low and you‚Äôll almost always need to restock,  what‚Äôs the point of charging an arm and a leg for something you likely got as a workshop drop?
---
Oh, one other note, 2 methods of transferring items!
---
* 1st: The trade menu. For large #s of items it is incredibly tedious since you basically have to set each item at 0 caps then "buy" them with your other character. It does however basically guarantee you don't lose any items.
---
* 2nd: Find a container, drop items into it, and pick them up from 2nd character. Some have 0/0 weight capacity, those you can essentially stack any number of items in eg. you could drop 500 lbs of armor into a cash register. If there's a number, like a trash can may show 0/20, it'll only let you put in up to 20 lbs of items, so a large item that weighs &gt;20 couldn't be dropped in. The down-side to this though (it's happened to me, only once though) is that potentially the server could crash after you've dropped the items into the container, but before you have them safely picked up by your other account. So the server crashes and you lose all the items.
---
I almost always go with the 2nd method, but I only do a couple of items at a time. And if there's anything I absolutely want 0 chance of losing, I do a proper trade with my characters.
---
50 is more than 14
---
Much appreciated 
---
That's a good point, I did not really consider that. I'll probably make updates to the list as the market changes
---
That would be ideal. Some level of transparency when dealing with the randomness would go a long way. 
---
Or maybe add atoms as event rewards.
---
It is not necessary to own a second copy of the game to have a mule character. However, it can make the process more ‚Äúsafer‚Äù.
---
I have a mule character, she is a second character I made on my account. You can transfer items by having a friend with an active account that can help you later to return to the same server with the Join option in the social tap.
---
You only need to go to a secluded place with a container that can be easily accessed by your second character. Then, leave the items you want to transfer on the container and leave the server to the main menu. Finally, you change character [mule character], join your friend to return to the same server you left your items, and pick up the items from the container.
---
You need to be careful on this process as if your friend changes server or exit the game, you can lost the items you left on the container. 
---
Seriously though. That is hilarious as fuck. Congratulations xD
---
Cool thank you very much 
---
I've been crushing it there also, haven't noticed it much elsewhere though.
---
I don't do pvp as I think it's a crapshoot but in terms of burning beasts, I feel the answer for me lies with prime plans..I'm level 165 and I have not yet fought a SBQ and that's deliberate on my part. It's coming soon but I feel your pain on this..if you have the weapon of destruction, you craft the build is how I work. I have a gorgeous melee weapon in a 3 star meat hook with swing speed so melee crafting was about armour for me..now I'm looking at shotguns
---
Nah, I looked at the map and saw them respawn nearby. I dropped them in when I saw them running up.
---
I never got to use it in the pre-update era. It is admittedly a bit clunky, but being able to flip from a combat loadout and a travel/crafting one with a few keystrokes is pretty useful.
---
The more qualit yof life stuff the better
---
I plan to sell the stuff for the suggested prices listed on each item unless it's super rare. But I'm going to be selling all the stuff I dont use, legendaries included, purified water, chems, anything I dont use or need. Mainly as a means to unload stuff and make some caps lol. 
---
Yeah this sounds like a good second option for sure. Thank you! 
---
The first 30 take about the same time as 14 so yes, this is mostly true. So to swap back and forth would be 28 levels. So swapping back and forth once would be nearly the same time as a whole new character. I rest my case
---
and all those ultracite limb plans you can just stroll over to a terminal and get without wasting any ammo.
---
I would also add the area where scorched earth takes place
---
I still dont get what they are trying to do woth those turret bases, everytime i see them, the turrets are blasting ghouls non stop behind the clubhouse, but the owner is nowhere to be seen
---
so, the owner is getting no XP from it all or items
---
SO WHAT IS THE POINT&gt;!&gt;!&gt;!&gt;!&gt;!
---
they really just @#$@$@ up the farming for everyone else
---
I found you can use an orbital strike on those turret bases, then before the strike hits, you immediately leave server
---
the strike still happens, the base gets destroyed, but then you dont get a bounty
---
verified many times by people who stay in server to watch the strike still happen after i leave server
---
You can play solo in adventure mode. You literally have entire mode to play with like minded people. People complained about pvp in adventure so they made survival and now your complaining about survival why? Its risk vs reward not bribes. I solo pve content till it runs out...then I solo pvp, the best content will always be players. Each encounter is different, it requires strategies and tactics. Adventure is the the mode your supposed to win. You actually have to understand the game mechanics and also have some tact to be successful in survival. 
---
I have people already forgotten that bulked junk originally couldn't be scrapped by "scrap all junk"? It's a bug the've yet to fix, but are aware of.
---
I would like for you to pick a spot on the map and it only loads that cell or it and a few surrounding in attempts to give you a large build budget. Basically, if I‚Äôm in creative mode, I don‚Äôt need 95% of the map or any of the game logic that takes place there.
---
Yep!
---
I agree. If they made it a no turret zone, that would be nice. I like to drop my porta-camp back there. I have a switch that turns off turrets, since I move it around in dangerous areas a lot and like to be able to enable them.
---
Everything a nuke farmer needs. There for my convenience, but it usually has a few using it in any given nuke.
---
It could be changed in one of the ini files last I heard.  Not sure if that's just a local thing, or if other people can see it too.
---
I've bought 2 copies and gifted 3 so far! Friends and Family who game together stay together lol
---
Could you put your build to compare with mine?
---
I don't pvp but when I see this camps with tons of turrets I shot them especially in nuke zones 
---
 *i know, i know, we can get ATOMS in game through playing.* 
---
Even then, you only earn atoms at a quick pace early-to-mid game. One you hit endgame, the atom earning slows to a crawl and you have to start actively completing specific challenges. Eventually all that's left that can be completed in a reason amount of time is daily and weekly challenges which only give you a rather small amount of atoms (60 for daily and 150 for weekly.
---
IMO, they should implement more methods to get atoms in-game outside of challenges. 
---
Mines a mess bud but I will change it back to a melee for ya and then do ones for shotgun and rifle and message ya direct. 
---
Yeah, I am on PC. As far as my preferences, at this point, basically active and flexible are the only ones I have. I'm fine adapting to any theme, if that's what you're asking. If you have a discord or would just like to elaborate on what you're trying to do, I'd love to hear it.
---
I have 3-4 handmade and lever action weapons in my stash along with a few radium rifles.  Most of them are 1-2 stars and many have legendary effects and a number of decent mods. 
---
Interesting enough, I have not received one drop of any of those weapons in all of my playing.  
---
I did get a 3 star vampire missile launcher last night. 
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
Please take your only source of income, beyond initial game purchase, and make it free, thanks.
---
I know you'll keep the servers going, out of the kindness of your hearts.
---
Signed,
---
OP
---
yeah its a broken part of the game, BEthesda has so far ignored it, im not hopeful anytime they will fix it
---
I prefer to stick around and complete the total destruction, including them if they return.
---
Ok, I get the greater the risk the greater the reward thing, and I understand that's the case. What sucks is that on Adventure you literally have to kill legendary, after legendary, after legendary to get the weapon or armor you want, and you're not guranteed to get it. I couldn't tell you how many legendary wood items or raider armors I've gotten off of 3* legendaries. The one that irked me the most was the 3* raider armor I got off the Scorchqueen after Scorched Earth. Talk about a kick to the teticles. On Survival it's practically guranteed. It would be nice if maybe certain legendaries dropped specific legendary items so we know what to grind to get what we want. With other games, you know certain bosses have a chance to drop specific items so you can farm it in hopes of getting it. With this game it's so hit and miss it's almost not worth it.
---
Maybe instead of atoms, we could find it at Morgantown school and send him for caps. Maybe it could even be used as a sort of tracking device to find people
---
I just assume everyone in West Virginia was blind 90% of the day lol
---
And make weapons/apparel with the same condition level \*stack\* when you make them
---
Or a harmonica for fs. We have 1 wind based instrument, and we have a banjo as well. 
---
Using VATS will burn through cores as well. 
---
He was reflecting on the previous few months since launch, and one of the funniest bits of mail he got was a box of bobby pins with ‚Äúweigh this‚Äù written on it. 
---
But when I'm in a melee mood I don't first want to level 14 times, or vice versa. I can hop on my melee character right now and if I suddenly don't feel like it anymore I can easily swap to my gun character within seconds.
---
Just in case u don't know, the sulfer water fountain at whitesprings cures diseases when you drink from it.  It's outside the clubhouse in the gazebo behind the tennis court.
---
Thanks for the insight. I normally just vendor them all myself, looks like I will have to keep some of them.
---
Be nice if they showed unlearned mods as greyed out options while crafting - you have not learned this mod, but here's what it does.
---
Wow your chems are about twice the price of mine. What system are you on?
---
so paying 460 is not enough? and its too much of me to ask some of the rewards be available in game?
---
MADNESS! 
---
how dare I!?!?!?
---
To be fair the article, although brief, is reporting on Todd speaking at a recent event not reporting on an ancient and resolved issue as such. 
---
Haha, nice video
---
Stupid question, how are you switching to a different game?
---
I go to the map, select Quit at the bottom of the menu list on the left. This takes me back to the main FO76 home screen. From there I can go back in and play, pick a different character and go back in and play, go to settings, etc but can't get out of the game and back to Xbox.
---
I'll have to save that for my fourth run.  Got a lvl 200  unarmed melee, a lvl 80 power armor heavy Gunner and level 40 vats crit rifle build (inspired by cheesy survival mode fights and not wanting to drop 400 caps per death for no reason lol)
---
it would be neat if you can get a special mod once you get all the mods for that weapon
---
Are you guys certain of this? I had a couple of vendor crop up with new building plans this week... The reason I know is I had bought them out of CAMP plans, and one cropped up with a metal bench and the other had a long pew  i dodnt have. I bought them, so I will check agaon during my selling run tonight.
---
&gt; The item is a rare resource in Fallout 76...
---
No, they're not at all.
---
&gt;Bethesda eventually fixed the problem
---
So, old news being recycled.  When was that, January?
---
&gt;The bobby pin became the face of everything wrong with Fallout 76
---
Maybe for 1 guy, but really...no.
---
&gt;...one of the most passive aggressive forms of complaining in the history of video games thus far?
---
Seriously?
---
I guess the news cycle for gaming is just dead right now.
---
Most ammo is about 0.5 caps a round.
---
Screws and springs about 3 each. Steel 1 each if you're lucky. Lead 2/3 each.
---
Weapons and armour depend entirely on their legendary effects.
---
Economics suggest that those prices will have you selling nothing. Itll be a buyer's market for a while.  The market will be flooded.
---
Correct. The Xbox side menu isn't popping out. The screen just dims a little. Pushing the Home button on the controller again 'undims' the screen and returns focus to FO76.
---
same!
---
I have never seen a CAMP near Prime that interfered with the event in any way, and I have done a lot of SBQ battles, to the contrary, it provides a great spot to scrap, stash, and make repairs when they are located just outside the Blast zone. I have seen a few in the Blast Zone but they were always simple CAMPs with workbenches and no turrets.  Trust me when I say, the crew I run with would take them out if it was interfering in any way.
---
Concentrated fire is in PER. 
---
You get those from enclave. And only in mod form. They dont have patterns
---
Exterminator perk in Perception makes short work of crickets, mirelurks, etc.
---
Terminal 
---
great idea!
---
I just can't see any way to make that system work when building space is first-come-first-served for who's logging in.
---
Going to help with perk card farming, aka lvling past 50
---
I‚Äôd rather trade them in for Atom.
---
I sell junk, lots and lots of junk. In a few weeks I've made 20k caps. Things that always sell:  
---
Flux (Violet in Particular get about 75-120 per)
---
Aluminum (2-4per)
---
Lead (2-3 per)
---
Steel (1 per)
---
Acid (3-4 per)
---
Adhesive (2-3 per)
---
Ballistic Fiber (3-5 per)
---
Super easy sales XD
---
yeah i nuked west tec last night and it has a shit ton of colbalt but nothing else
---
25 caps
---
Oh, right, didn't consider that part
---
whatever the vendor will give you for it
---
I agree with these comments shared by OP and i'd like to add... I'd love to see these in game but also make atoms more easily attainable AND still lower the atom price tag so if we can't get lucky rng in game...we can buy it. but now even on sale everything I want is not purchasable. atom gain is slow and pricetags are high.
---
and since so many suggested things tend to find their way as items to buy ...how about all our feedback feels like it's being listened to.
---
The default controls are terrible and unintuitive on PC.  We shouldn't have to remap basic function keys.  That's just bad design.
---
Bio, I thought the same for a while the realized as Basher said, those at actually to separate Cap stashes. My base is close to Blackwater and I see BOTH in probably 6 x in every 10 visits. 
---
One is by the power armor shed dumpster at the North end of the building and the other as you noted is by the upright barrel closest to the big shed and forklift.
---
Seems to be all or nothing for me, if I don‚Äôt see one the other isn‚Äôt there either.
---
I am regularly  pausing before swinging. Killed me fighting a lvl 91 Deathclaw. 
---
I totally agree. The art was stunning. It should have had more I agree.
---
I hit the xbox button to bring up the xbox menu on the lefthand side of the screen. It seems to automatically create a shortcut to the last used games/apps. I select a different game to launch that game and it closes fo76. Once the other game starts, I can do the same thing to open fallout 76... and it's pretty fast too. This was one of those things where "it works for me, not going to try to figure out a better way to do it" so I don't know if there is a better way.
---
If you're not getting the side menu for any reason, try googling 'hard reset xbox', I think it's some version of pulling the power cord. If I'm completely misunderstanding your problem/questions, I apologize.
---
gotta be server lag. he has followed me 4 times in the bog and never had a insult thrown. I waited a few minutes also each time. Bethesda isn't allocating enough resources to keep the servers optimal or they dont have the resources to keep them optimal.
---
I just want to change the pip-boy color since it always change the flashlight color. White all the way for a better flashlight!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure somewhere between 5 and 7 it was fixed.  But then it came back around the time they did the broken weapon auto change which also screwed up the quick change between last equipped weapon.  
---
With a decent weapon, you should be able to kill the Scorched at a SBQ fight with 1-2 shots.  If you're the only one shooting them, I go back to my first comment, need more people handling crowd control.  But maybe consider using Power Armor to get out of over encumbered or change your build to have more APs.
---
tanagra isnt a random spawn location, random spawn locations arent marked on the map. the bridge up the road to the west of big b‚Äôs rest stop has a random spot right under the bridge. 
---
getting a megasloth is completely random though so you‚Äôll probably get a ton of different corpses, deathclaws, scorched and brahmin before you find a megasloth but if you try to server hop long enough you‚Äôll get one eventually
---
I've seen a couple of them at prime but the last one was a little shack with 8 turrets that didn't let the queen to come to the ground. My team is the same if we see camps that interfere with nuke zones we shot the turrets 
---
You‚Äôre just mad you‚Äôre not getting what YOU want man. There was nothing guaranteed about getting that gun other than completing that challenge, get your participation trophy ass out of here
---
Will it really be 'secret' when everyone knows about that feature?  
---
Thanks for this but yes, Watoga has even more...just off the top of the head, bobblehead on high school roof next to tent and in transit center on counter. 2 more magazine possibilities in the building past the shopping center, small diner (but not THE diner)...the corner building with an eat-o-matic in it by the water's edge. 
---
Don't let the other two guys dissuade you.  That 10% while aiming is the most underrated effect in this game.
---
better yet show the mod "greyed out" in the crafting menu like in fo4.  In the description you can include why it's greyed out with 2 options: 
---
1. "you must break down more items of this type or find the plans to craft this"
---
2. "you must find the plans for this mod as you cannot learn it from breaking down items of this type"
---
agreed, if they responded so fast to bug reports to get fixed as they do with the ATOM store, we would have no problems with the game
---
im not trying to sound salty, i really do love this game and play it waaaaay too much, but this is constructive criticism and i hope people understand that
---
Yeah I check the vendor in the correct room in the bunker every time I log in but it's almost always kinetic servos and lights, sometimes arm mods. I already have the targeting hud and bright light, just need the reactive plates, the jet pack, and the calibrated shocks. I'm rockin a t51 with a jet pack and I havent found any other mods for it besides the bright light. 
---
With the machines, you really only have one option (I'd assume) and that's caps.  And it'll be whatever the seller wants, and if it's too much for the buyer to accept, they won't accept it.  That's all that's going to happen.
---
Oh... Thanks for the well worded response my dude üëçüèº
---
The good news is they de-aggro after a time, even in the same log-in. At least on PC. Just run away if you can and give a cool-down for a couple of hours.
---
I have found logging off and back on and going back hasn‚Äôt worked, at least through patch 7. They‚Äôd tank me the moment I walked through the gate.
---
I think the low price comments are due to it being lvl 35.
---
Does using vats in power armor still produce a high drain on fusion cores or has that been fixed?
---
Yeah the poison dart gun was epic. I used it constantly on all kinds of enemies but mainly to cripple the death claws 
---
You would expect I could one shot them with my 350 damage gatling, but I can't see through the green. Also, I usually don't do nuke zones anymore and it was a random decision along with the fact I fast travelled to a safe spot but spawned into the nuke zone because Todd Howard. I basically just accepted the fact I would die a bunch and stayed after it spawned me in the nuke.
---
Nope, you have it. The side menu isn't popping out.
---
Haven't gotten around to pulling the plug yet. Just been holding down the controller's Home button till the option to power down the console or the controller comes up and selecting console.
---
Thanks.
---
the servers arent always even functioning though. 
---
and some game mechanics are not functioning (my sneak perk cards and chamo armor and stim armor) - they are entirely broken. as in, I get charged by mobs while crouched. &lt;white hidden text&gt; above my head, with full stealth perks and sneak and chameleon armor and when I do get attacked I can be two shot while wearing multiple  pieces of auto stim armor  ...im over lvl 100 and this has happened in the Savage divide even or grafton. kinda think something is wrong and it's not just me needing to git gud.
---
we should, when buying a game get a game that WORKS. like functions. before we start talking about them keeping servers running out of the goodness of their hearts. (kinda thought buying a game guaranteed being able to play it though and they did comment on it being around forever or something)
---
We Level the CAMP and send Instigating messages to the owner, which frequently leads to PVP events and the offender logging out.
---
That would've been straight up amazing. Get Todd on the goddamm phone, now!
---
Since I plan  on mostly peddling ammo, I figure 1 to 5 caps for most ammo types would be reasonable since you probably can't list them for less than one cap apiece.  So, based on how much they can be produced all at once, or how much you can just pick up in a run through a super mutant camp, they would be like so:
---
.38, 308, 50 Cal = 1 cap  
---
5.56/fusion cells = 2 caps
---
.45 = 3 caps  
---
This would need refining of course, but off the top of my head this is what they'd go for.  Since every man and his dog can make booze now, it's really going to be a matter of is it cheaper to buy a few bottles of beer from me or fast travel somewhere else to get the mats to make them yourself?  So probably five caps or so.
---
I would think may be sell at 9 caps. If you're cleaned out a couple a times a day. You're gonna be getting more caps per day because you can only have 1400 caps from vendors a day
---
If the items in your stash and person effect the drop rates, wouldn't your breakdown on items, weapons, types etc drop rates be completely different for each individual?
---
I had one of these, or very similar in stats, devastating damage. But geeze it nearly destroyed itself each time I used it for more than 6 shots. Still managed to have some fun with it.
---
SAME I'm so sick of feeling attacked when I want a game I love to be improved! sure I'm salty. I want it to thrive tho. I love it!
---
ED-E My Love... 
---
Mine is next to a train station, so odds are anyone in the area will already be there with shopping in mind.
---
4 hours.
---
In only got one, but gave it away. Wasn't really impressed with any of the drops. Largely just had fun dancing with the robots and turning suicider's heads into a fine red mist. 
---
And +1 for the username. Surprisingly high turnout of MLP fans in '76. 
---
Planning on selling what I can get from selling to a vendor +10% to help out other players more than getting rich. 
---
I sell rad ant lagers on the regular for 150 each and will continue to do so. 
---
Well dude get used to it. Level 151 and im still missing at least 4 cards. Radicool being one that I've wanted to use for months
---
If the top three was based on kills I would be playing it instead of adventure. I don't like being punished for keeping to myself. 
---
Here is what I know to be true:
---
My camp was at 100% budget. I gained 15-20 levels. Moved location. Blueprint was at 100% of budget. Went back and scrapped everything but my workbenches, generator, and rad shower. Rebuilt exact same base again, camp budget was only 80%.
---
I dont think your budget increases as you level, but the cost of the item being built (budget-wise) reduces.
---
We should definitely have more wind instruments
---
No, it's value is in PvP damage. But there are far better effects you could have for that.
---
1 star = 100 caps
---
2 stars = 200 caps
---
3 stars = Well you see where I am going with this... if you don't...300 caps
---
Junk = 1-3 caps ea
---
Bullets = 1 caps ea (would be 0.3, but probably cant sell below 1)
---
Flux = 50 caps ea
---
Plans/Recipes = 20 caps ea
---
Hmm.  Think may be interesting.  You kill the first group to take the workshop, then you'll get several chances for them to respawn when the workshop come under attack.  Of course it would have to be a high level area workshop.
---
I want this so badly. Also, honestly, a gentle audio ... Something, to go with it, wouldn't be amiss. (At least an option for that, anyway!)
---
I have another idea.  I believe guns in the wild can come with random mods, and if that's the case then tie what you can learn to what it has(if that isn't how it is done already).  I never paid attention to those +'s I see, however what can be done is that they can instead make that + signify whether or not the weapon has a mod the character doesn't know.  A quick glance tells you whether or not to scrap it for the chance to learn the mod, making it also the only way to learn the mods besides buying the plans.
---
Certain mods can be made more rare this way, by making them more rare in the wild and also at shops.  My friend and I already trade a few weapons back and forth because neither of us have all the mods, so this could possibly give people in possession of the mod plans a way to make extra caps here and there.
---
I agree with this and think it's rather silly to have digital items have a limited quantity or date of availability.
---
If Bethesda does in fact support 76 until the end of time as they claim, then your going to have millions of potential customers who may want certain items months or even years after they were "put in the vault". 
---
These players may not have yet owned 76 and couldn't have known, missing out for really no good reason.
---
I understand why your doing these things Bethesda, but please, don't make anything impossible to acquire, don't make anything limited or exclusive. Everything in the Atom shop should always remain in the rotation. Everything.
---
(If anything, have some kind of in-game Catalogue, showing every single item that's ever been in the Atom Shop, and a way for people to tag currently unavailable items so they could be notified by email when they come back.)
---
man so on survival the xp will be nuts as it's already boosted so adding another 100% on top will be amazing.  
---
Imagine nuked whitesprings, if players actually refrained from murdering each other you could definitely soak up some massive XP :P
---
I am convinced servers have a predetermined loot pool, either server-wide or player. I get way too many of the same prefixes on each server.
---
Never thought about it that way. I always pick them up and give them to new level 1 players at vault 76 or I dropped them for low level players at the Fastnacht event.
---
They must have lightened nights at some point. I swear I remember thinking, "geez, this game is pretty dark, why would some people want it darker?" (Especially in the Mire) but now I often am not sure if it's even night or not. 
---
Did they change it at some point? Or have I simply become so familiar with what I'm seeing it seems that way?
---
Did not get this perk and no intention at the moment. I use VATS a lot so it's not going to benefit my style. 
---
Big problem with this is that if you remove a mod from a gun the mods deleted not added to your inventory like fallout 4
---
That is my thinking. The bog or mire shops would do.
---
Yes, assuming that there are no other effects, such as server-specific default chances or global default chances. In other terms, each server may prefer a specific legendary effect, say Assassin's or Bolstering, and globally, the chance to get a Nocturnal item is set to twice the uniform chance. Thus, if you prefer Bloodied, you'd get Nocturnal, Assassin's and Bloodied drops more than any other.
---
We could get some confirmation/rejection of this if more people would track all their drops while they stash one very specific item/effect.
---
That's a valid point I didn't think of it that way i wasnt even thinking about my own cap flow if I'm honest, my initial thought process was that I wanted them to go to good use for players rather than being traded to the vendor bots as those vendor bots are a rip off when it comes to actually buying chems! I remember being low level and it was tough on caps when buying stimpacks as I didn't know how to make or where to find them then. I do like the 9 caps price though makes them cheap enough still that lower levels can stock up and if they do get all snatched up for sale to the vendor bots there profit from it will literally be 20 caps which isn't really worth it. 
---
Unfortunately no 
---
 if you find one that you can tame it will be lvl 20 period unless it's scorched
---
Have had this happen a few times prior to patch and recent maintenance.
---
I and many others have done the same thing. Nothing changed for us. 
---
It's possible that you're seeing an overall change to your budget, I can't speak for what other players encounter on their own PCs. But even if you are seeing change, it could be due to things like bugs or phantom decor getting deleted with the camp move. There is no reason to believe there is a mechanic that actively reduces item cost as you level because there is literally no evidence other than anecdotal stories to support it.  
---
That said, if you think you have solid evidence feel free to link it. I'd really love to end this debate once and for all. xD  
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to nuke mt Blair as the defense events never seem to end when the excavator is powered. Idk if the enemies would scale though or if there is a cap.  
---
Agreed, I liked roaming around and exploring even with the buggy launch, but some of the bugs made the game unplayable.  The game has really changed since then and hopefully they will continue to improve and build on it.
---
...I just can't play. My stash is full of gear that I am supposed to sell to players, but can't at the moment. That means my inventory is full of aid items that I can't store and I don't want to lose another 90+ super stimpacks.
---
Happens all the time. If you're wondering how other players see it, they see it as a salute, not the gesture shown. Which I don't mind
---
great idea! well thought out!
---
Well that sucks. I could have used that a few weeks ago when I wanted to scrap gamma guns for the deep dish mod.
---
PA with emergency protocols. Bloodied explosive gatling gun with prime receiver. Kill them in seconds out of the sky. When legendary vendor comes out I think anybody will be able to customize their guns to whatever they want so yall can get one too. 
---
I was able to buy mine from a vendor with 8 charisma, hard bargain and a beer for about 8600 caps. Knowing that, if I find those plans, I wouldn't sell them for anything less than 4000 caps.
---
Time to take some workshops.
---
Scrapping the gun with the mod attached would be how you learn it.  You find a rifle in the wild, the name has a + by it, you scrap it, then you have a chance to learn that mod.
---
Or, you could have just ignored it an moved on with your day instead of making a snide comment...
---
He never came back.
---
Maybe you should consider using this tactic yourself since you have the build. You could make good money buying from player vendors and selling to NPC vendors. Post apocalyptic day trader lmao.
---
Would be to cool to figure out what will trigger this so we can keep her in the area. 
---
You want to know the worst part? I looted 25% of everything I hit. It was a waste for me, barely got anything. 
---
Hell, even the devs between NMS stuck with their game and now it's getting VR modes this summer. I don't like this *the sky is falling* trend with every game release nowadays. If something isn't good it isn't abandoned anymore, they'll stick with it so they can at least charge you for DLCs.
---
They will be back. This is a common marketing strategy and creates false demand
---
Not too different. We just got comfortable with what we had for content. Not a bad thing though
---
Same. I'm like level 86 and I had to google where addictol was. There seems to be a single location at the penitentary infirmary.
---
I wonder if it works like the ripper, where if you get the perk card that allows you to repair weapons to 200%,  you can actually increase the DPS making it much more a viable weapon
---
I nuked the converted munitions factory after having it taken by griefers and nothing really changes. It destroys all built items and whatever enemies spawn normally are higher level or scorched
---
Jump on the survival server, kill everything 
---
Yeah things seem fuckey right now. I could rarely find the top three on the map. My PVP character found nobody for their session, but my PVE melee character found tons of people. There was a lot of hiding around corners and punching buttholes when people ran by. Got some much needed caps on that character.
---
I'll try this tonight.
---
GOOD TRY TODD!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
150 concrete
---
i just did, found where they spoke about survival; thanks!
---
Explosive is like 3 times better though
---
Hyperbole much
---
I have only 3200 caps now and I'm not really specced for PvP, so I guess I'll have to wait.
---
Aww. not good news.
---
What does PvP have to do with this?
---
Both quick swap and this reloading thing have been broken for me for a while now.
---
Lol I can imagine the Polygon article ‚ÄúBethesda gives platform for alt right trolls to dress up as confederate soldiers to harass POC and women. This problematic situation is proof of the toxicity of the Fallout fan base.‚Äù 
---
The only issue that could be with #1 is preventing other players from accessing an area. If I setup shop inside a random house and dump a metric fuck ton of turrets and traps in there AND/OR just a stupid number of walls/doors that players have to burn through resources to get to, that's shitty. 
---
Also what if I have a CAMP like that and someone is sitting in that house when I spawn in, in the middle of my camp?
---
At one point I put the game down for a while as the issues were so bad but after the large patch iv been playing pretty much non stop. Love it now. 
---
A giant swarm of bees
---
I know about the mini quest. I followed it the best I could and I got to the current location for it.
---
Nuke whitesprings playing in a team.  In about 12 hours of play we got 3 of us to lvl 60-80.  Reset the server for almost constant respawn at whitesprings.  
---
It would have much more annoying if I'd been actively trying to find him instead of him just being there when I went to Charleston to kill the level 10 Grafton Monster under the bridge for the kill a cryptid daily.
---
Survival mode is a good way to make quick bucks if you are good at it.
---
Oh my god. This would be terrifying.
---
TY, still on the fence about buying
---
Have you tried actually restarting the console to see if the behavior changes? When "powering off," the console actually goes into a hibernation state so it can quickly power back on. There's an option in the settings to actually do a full warm restart of the system without having to pull the plug. 
---
 You could have just ignored me an moved on with your day instead of making a snide comment...
---
There‚Äôs different theories floating around but no official word from Bethesda to confirm or deny any of those theories (if build size increases with leveling or if items cost less budget in higher levels). What is known is that there are certain items that use up way more budget than others. Mainly the Brahmin pen, lights, and turrets. 
---
The atom store is supposed to be finding new content development. 
---
I've done this. It's especially funny when a piece of music like the Can Can or something comes on while you're one shooting scorched off rooftops.
---
I just want a bunker underground so I have a little secret top-side bar and my home is underground
---
It's actually pretty accurate... maybe even an understatement.
---
They get the loot that drops from the ghouls,If people stop training them out the back door the turrets cant shoot anything. 
---
Survivor level-100
---
It is only at a workbench when you can add it I believe.  Not in your inventory, buying it, or if you don't have the right weapon/armor on the bench.  
---
I look them up online, tbh.
---
Wasn't Mike Tyson in FO2?
---
It has always been a thing. I noticed it on like day 3 when I grouped up with a friend. 
---
I don‚Äôt *think* you even have to be in a team. 
---
That sounds brilliant!
---
Ikr. I just spend my time exploring the world and listening to the music. That's what this game is for me mostly
---
If they did, I‚Äôm gonna guess....1000 caps for the lamp 
---
Ah ok. Cool, then you‚Äôre at least on the right track. 
---
But you‚Äôre saying when you get to the end of it the key isn‚Äôt there? That‚Äôs most likely that someone else on the server has snagged it but it‚Äôs very odd that your server hops didn‚Äôt work, I would think most people who want that key already have it. 
---
LMFAO. Very creative. 10/10.
---
Thats so true and if the price is right it would be rude not too lol. I can see me spending the first week or so hopping round player vendors more than anything else when it launches as theres plenty of plans out there I want to collect still, my character is shaped around crafting so the more plans I can learn the more services I can offer in turn hopefully
---
That makes sense, but you're still kind_of_a_dick.
---
I understand.  College economics is coming back to me a bit now.
---
On a side note, if I wanted someone to crush my dreams I'd have talked to my wife ;)
---
That‚Äôs where I store my bulk since I have such a high % of weight reduction - it lets me store heavier things in my stash :D
---
I thought that too, but I had. 100% loaded and burned through it to quickly I think. But I was using vats a lot

Minutes turned into hours, sorry

What would an explosive plasma Gatling gun fetch?

Thanks, I knew I was forgetting something!
---
bug thats has always happened randomly. 
---
We desperately need a fo76 version of poetrade app.
---
Your pipboy light doesnt turn on when you are in a power armor chassis, that function is remapped to the headlamp on the power armor helmet. If you are not wearing a helmet then there is no light to turn on. 
---
People wanted the benefit of the power armor frame and were willing sacrifice having light for the extra carry weight. but then just turned around and bitched that the nights where too dark.... 
---
I will buy every piece of legendary you sell.
---
Holy shit I am.
---
When I thought of it I thought "I'm the most creative person in the world"
---
I'll probably sell aid and ammo, something like that. Nothing like a real huge supermarket, more like a convenience store. My prices will probably be sonething similar to this:
---
Stimpak: 25caps
---
Radaway: 15caps
---
Bobbleheads(any one): 50caps 
---
Magazines(any one): 40 caps
---
Vintage Nukashine: 50caps
---
5:56 Rounds: 1cap per bullet
---
10mm Rounds: 1cap per 2 bullets
---
5mm Rounds: 1cap per 3 bullets
---
.308 Rounds: 1cap per 8 bullets
---
.38 Rounds: 1cap per 6 bullets
---
Fusion Cell: 1cap per 2 cells
---
Plasma Cartridge: 1cap per 2 cartridges
---
Nuka Grenade: 40 caps
---
Plasma Grenade: 30 caps
---
Frag Grenade: 20 caps
---
I'll prob do adjusting based on demand, though
---
I make a lot of booze and if they come to my bar, I'll give some out for free.  I'll go shot for shot on Nukashine.
---
If Fallout 76 let you have a pet eyebot I name him ED-E because he was my favorite pet in New Vegas 
---
Thats awesome. I just recently picked the game up again after only playing the first few weeks of launch so Im only level 20, and I think I might build my character towards trading now. Its pretty cool seeing capitalism start to form in the wasteland lol. The commies didnt win!!
---
I won‚Äôt be touching survival mode until they take off the bloody player map markers and fresh wipe characters 
---
It was apparently a change they made a few patches ago. Only the person who called it in can collect it without a bounty. A dumb change in my opinion especially since there‚Äôs really nothing indicating that you‚Äôll receive a bounty from looting it
---
And with that reply, now I know I am the first to make that joke.
---
Perhaps I should live up to my name ;-)
---
Which platform are you on? I'm in need of some violet and crimson flux to construct my decontamination shower. Despite my server hopping recently I haven't seen a nuke in around a week, and with current reports of server disconnects after launching the nuke yourself I'm not prepared to have to deal with that kind of disappointment haha.

Fun instrument fact: violins set up as fiddles usually have a slight structural difference than regular violins.  The bridge (the bit that holds the strings up and in place) is flatter on a fiddle than on a regular violin.  It's to make hitting two strings at once (also called a double stop) easier since it's a commonly used technique in fiddling.  
---
Not that this would make a lick of difference on an in-game model.  But yes, violins/fiddles would be fun.
---
That is disappointing
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt even think of that, I was just thinking physical space in the world. Thanks!
---
Because it isn't ~~Your ~~ supply drop. Unless you're the one who initiated  the drop, you're stealing someone else's supplies unless they have already unlocked it and chosen to leave stuff there,
---
Dual Bar mod looks more badass in my opinion. But it's rather hard to find than the Long Bow mod.
---
Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a laser beam explode at the point of contact? That‚Äôs why right there, it expires early out of shear exhaustion. 
---
Prices are going to fluctuate as we see what the effect of the legendary trader is. Remember that prices are high because of the rarity of certain combinations of effects. If the legendary trader can make getting those combinations easier, prices will probably drop. I would much rather trade in 50 vendor trash 1\* legendaries for tokens and use the tokens to make a nice 3\* handmade then pay the current 30K+ for one.
---
I thought I heard that level 20 was the only chainsaw that spawns. 
---
Well the lower level guy that killed me got 10 caps lol
---
It does, coupled with the Adrenaline perk it's nuts.
---
It used to be 4 hours.  since a patch they only seem to last 2 hours. I'm probably wrong but I'm sure it's only that long.
---
There is a spacesuit outfit in one of the compartments of the station, IRC.
---
This is definitely an issue that's been around for a while. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqxg1u/fusion_cores_draining_unacceptably_fast_when/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about how fusion cores were draining unacceptably fast when using VATS, and u/Aten_Ra had included this particular problem in one of their [Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundups for Power Armor in February 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amsncf/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_power/). Even after the latest hotfix, the issue of fusion cores draining ridiculously fast still persists, even when using the perk that doubles how long they last (Power User), especially so when using VATS while in power armor. There are other things that hit your fusion core charge quite hard, too, such as power attacks and jet packs. There's lots of details in both posts I've linked, far moreso in Aten\_Ra's kick-ass write-up!
---
u/LadyDevann and u/Valseek, could you please flag this issue for inspection and (hopefully) rectification, or let us know if this is completely intended and won't be changing? Many thanks - and keep up the great work!
---
Dual Bar mod exists but is kinda hard to find at vendors. Looks more badass than the Long Bow mod.
---
Even the furniture is busted or dirty
---
that's what i thought at first, so i tested.  loaded my plasma, had 15 loaded, 726 in inventory.  server hopped, had an empty clip, 726 in inventory.  reload went to 15/711.  so, at least for that test, it disappeared.  harder to see if you have over 1K of an ammo type, with that silly 3digit max on your ammo store in the hud.
---
Yup. Doesn't give you as much as regular meat though. 
---
That sounds about right. I‚Äôm trying to time my venture into Whitespring until later in the cycle.
---
Thanks for the fun fact ! It‚Äôs interesting to know !
---
Yeah good luck trying to defend it on sites like PCGamer and Kotaku though. They shit on it for stupid reasons 
---
Late last night, I saw an advertisement for pills that were supposed to help in addition to increasing stamina.
---
Doesn‚Äôt spoil though
---
Oh, no, there‚Äôs no way of making the build circle bigger. We‚Äôre all confined to the same diameter of space unfortunately. It‚Äôs just what we build can vary greatly in size depending on the items we use. 
---
Surely a welcomed bug if so. In surface-to-air and Line in the sand the SBs won‚Äôt even when the event has failed. 
---
And there is good doggy
---
chemist does
---
no, they dont, unless they get 1 actual shot on the enemies, if a turret kills an enemy, but you dont actually shot it yourself to "tag" it, then you get nothing
---
I regret i have but one upvote
---
Instead of 'Open' you can read 'Steal'. You even get a Text Message in the Top Left before you pick the lock that this is not your supply drop and risk to get a bounty.
---
Chemist never doubled my Brews.  And I always had it on.
---
Sneak hides the top 3.
---
Good for explosive. That doesn't mean 10% damage isn't an underrated effect .
---
Downvote once and then upvote
---
Ta da double upvote
---
I feel it was always going to be an intended mechanic at some point, the back story is that we are rebuilding America so it makes perfect sense there were no human NPCs in game as that is up to us to fulfill the role. I really enjoyed the crafting aspect of fallout 4 so it made sense for me to gear my build towards it on 76. I need to tame a colonel gutsy for my camp to keep the commies away!
---
Eat less have smaller dumps
---
PC, I can supply decon shower needs XD always remember to put on contractor though, makes it MUCH cheaper!
---
just add me Davegrohl117
---
I didnt disagree I just said that explosive was better. It adds 20% damage and radius damage and you dont have to aim. The damage while aiming is under rated I was just pointing out where we were coming from and saying explosive is the better option.
---
Nieher does ionized meat. And it takes more hunger away. But that's how I use it. Don't need to carry food when I can just kill an animal and eat the raw meat. Or kill an enemy and munch away. All about play style. 
---
I have 1200 hours played, I‚Äôm the definition of endgame. And I have never farmed whitesprings for anything more than leveling a toon from 1-50. And trust me if I had spent my time aside from that, farming whitesprings, I would‚Äôve quit a long time ago. There are far better, and more interesting places.
---
The devs don‚Äôt need to change something to accommodate to you wanting to farm the same place over and over and over again, there‚Äôs literally hundreds of other locations, how about you be just a tiny bit creative and go to one of those instead.
---
&gt;so paying $60 for the game initially is not enough?
---
especially considering how cheap the development must have been
---
Aah ps4 here unfortunately thank you for the offer though I think I'm going to make a separate thread to ask I'm sure there will be someone on my platform who can help.
---
I saw someone in another thread reccomending a tactic that I tried, and it took me less than 10min to complete it :
---
Craft a level 1 pistol (so it does not use much AP, and does not do much damage to avoid killing)
---
Use vats with it and get your crit ready. Then switch to Shotgun and use crit.
---
I recommend to go up north in the forest, easy to find some houses with a few dogs or super mutants, and far away enough from players.
---
I am just going to sell Civil War Top hats for 10 caps.  Hundreds and hundreds of top hats for 10 caps each.  You can then sell them to a vendor for 30.
---
''Skill and Luck'' Spamming 2 Buttons until that one with the better internet wins. Do you know the Box Fights from Fallout 2? THATS how it should be done. Only Fists Stats, and Strategic VATS Hits Count. Hell i very much miss the Melee Vats where you could hit someone in the Eyes or Crouch...
---
Can‚Äôt recall getting the message in the top left but I do remember seeing the steal option. Thing is though it said steal on my own supply drop too. 
---
Survival mode, put your camp at the WS station, farm some players, then transition into WS golf course. 
---
Really? I thought sneak was disabled for top 3?
---
I acknowledge that we already got quantum paint for x01, nuka cola paint for t51 as an in-game loot. Needless to say, it's one of the best looking paint and Bethesda could have sold it for like more than 1000 atoms but they was like letting us have it after doing some quests. Also, here are like hundreds of good looking outfits that drop as a loot or quest rewards that don't cost you atoms. Isn't that enough? It's like you want atom shop gone for good and want Bethesda to hand out all them cosmetics for free
---
Yeah same here. My C.A.M.P. always seems to be kinda the home base when Im playing with my friends so Ive geared my character towards crafting and scavenging. I basically act as the quartermaster for our little gang lol. I spend hours at a time scavenging for scrap and making ammo, and gear for everyone.
---
I believe it was the Red Rocket filter
---
Follow-up question : with aluminum becoming the new currency of the wasteland (given the huge amount of caps one loses in survival) and the fail of caps as a player to player currency, is player vending still viable ?
---
That‚Äôs for Wanted players.
---
I thought crouching did not hide top three. Or is this new?
---
No pre packacked food counts as meat or vegetables.  You can eat Instamash with Carnivore and get food and you can eat Salisbury steak with herbivore and get food.
---
Super handy! Thanks
---
Did you just get a jetpack or start using VATS more?
---
Port to top of the world, go to the ski lodge and loot all the can chimes at the front door, easy 40-60 lead and 100+ steel, server hop and do it again.
---
I used to always sell them, but started hoarding ones I dont use to re-sell. I also buy them off ppl, provided they are selling for cheaper than I intend to
---
Economics... It's all about incentive. People have done the math, you get double the legendaries at whitesprings vs any other locations.
---
If ppl had choice between Janitor for $100 an hour and Teacher for $50 an hour I can assure you everyone would want to be a Janitor
---
I actually agree with you though. I mostly play along the roads and tracks in Cranberry Bog/ The Mire because whitest rings is fucking crazy boring and repetitive. 
---
Must be one I don‚Äôt have :/
---
Then why was I prompted to go find it then ? 
---
Thanks for mentioning this. I had a theory that that you wouldn't get a bounty by leaving before it hit, but kept forgetting to try it out.
---
Just started using vats more. I didn‚Äôt think that that would be it. But by seeing reply‚Äôs that may be the issue
---
Would you be willing to show some pictures of how you go about this process? I'm having a little trouble understanding what you mean in some steps.
---
Fallout e-sports made me stop reading this post üòÇ
---
It's not a frame it's in a separate section of the menu
---
Hmm
---
I miss those animations they had in FO4.
---
Xbox One. Full disclosure: I just made the price list up, making sure they were cheaper than vendors and then basing the final price on how useful I see them. Usually when ppl want to buy from me they are only interested in one specific chem, and buy all I have at the time.
---
I always entertain offers though! Specifically ammo. I treat 5.56 ammo like gold.
---
All I know is, automatic receivers have reduced AP cost. I think 33% reduction is the number I have seen thrown around.
---
Double exp starts tomorrow.  Server hop at whitesprings or another similar location.
---
flux is an easy sell, and i'd certainly buy it.  i don't have the time to try and farm that stuff.
---
The grinds on RS and 76 are so similar they need to just adopt so many aspects that osrs has lol 
---
It appears to. This does not work if the player is wanted.
---
After spending time as number 1, sneaking seems to generate a lot less action and hide the name.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. I remember people swarming to get the gun only to see the damage was low. Some rando DM‚Äôd me and wanted to charge me 10k to let me in the dome with their key. 
---
Im currently on 15 attempts. With nothing. I‚Äôve checked the primary location and the auxiliary location and neither have shown up. 
---
That math was done before the change. You can no longer respawn the golf house and that was the factor that made it superior.
---
Try using the "repair" option in the launcher.
---
There‚Äôs also weapons and armor that give more spans less so cost
---
Sometimes he‚Äôll even bug out and give you more than one. 
---
I don't see why not lol.
---
Obviously, Bethesda should add their own twist to it, but since osrs is so successful I feel like we can learn from some of their great ideas!
---
This reddit has 10 Moderators, directly from Bethesda that constantly reply to every important topic that gets attention by the playerbase of fallout 76. You can see it as direct feedback to yours or other ideas: If your sub dont get any attention from the playerbase itself , it is probably not generating enough attention for beth either.
---
If people want you reach the devs and voice their opinions they should search for other people that are experiencing the same and write in their subs, instead of opening another topic to the same problem.
---
Low. Probably 500 at the most.
---
A decent AP build makes it so AP cost is meaningless. You will regen it fast enough for it doesn't matter how much AP you're using.
---
I always try to get the best mods for my guns, even if the weight added negatively impacts the AP cost.
---
Get good guns, get the best mods, get range and get accuracy (from what i've heard hip fire accuracy is the one you want for vats but in my experience it doesn't make that much difference if  you have 100 accuracy + hip fire mod or 100 accuracy+aimed mods). 
---
Ignore AP costs. 
---
That‚Äôs absolutely odd. If you‚Äôre on PC I‚Äôll let you in for free. And the other two domes. 
---
I get stuff from the mobs my turret killls that I don't all the time. Hell, I've come up and found dead mobs that have stuff on them that my turrets killed while I was away. No experience but I still get stuff. So I'm guessing they do too. 
---
It‚Äôs cool, I just remembered this and wasn‚Äôt sure if I was crazy lol
---
id love to see a radio host of a Mr. Handy for the classical radio station, and an Assultron for the normal Appalachia radio
---
&gt;!Perhaps a Super Mutant for classical and a Non-feral ghoul if they do not use robots!&lt;
---
I'd probably aim for 400-800 caps for my shop listing, but you may be able to pull more given the right buyer. 
---
What if you don't mind playing through again? Cause I don't. I end up playing the world differently depending on my level and build, and the randomness of the early cards you get in the card packs, it gives me new ideas and ways to play the game.  And in the long run, as someone said above, I have different builds of characters built on demand at anytime, as opposed to having to wasted time switching back and forth. I'm also thinking ahead to Nuclear Winter and Wastelanders. Two characters ready at the go to me are better than worrying about switching perks cards back and forth on one character.  
---
Yes .. Love when this happens. It's like she misses the window and just hangs around .. one time this happens with a few of us and it took an additional 10 mins to finally drop her. This was prior to the last patch as well 
---
Yeah! Found some nice nuke points for Violet. It sells the best atm.
---
Good to know, I have been hoofing it like I'm Harrison Ford trying to run from Tommy Lee Jones!
---
I totally agree with this, however, I felt like this would be a good idea since not everyone who plays 76 is also active on here.
---
However, I do agree that there has been some excellent on the forums that Devs do take notice of.
---
Wastelanders last addon, new features. Robot companions for sure.
---
Yeah I suppose, or they could set up set locations like abandoned super duper marts and old red rockets that you can renovate. 
---
What's the respawn timr on flux? I cleared out a ton of it, and was able to reget the same flowers an hour later. Next nuke a few days later they never respawned. 
---
Do you think a weapon that does 1,000+ crit headshot damage ***shouldn't*** be able to 1-shot anyone?
---
PVP seems to be determined by who can get the first shots off, anyway. If the first shot didn't get you, there would still be a few more within 1/10 of a second, so not much difference.
---
Yeah but for it to spawn following people every time some one pays to use it means it will be spammed on people all the time. It's one thing for the game to do it as an amusing random encounter but let players spawn it on others whenever they want will become less amusing and more annoying. It will be used in place of get good or you suck messages. 
---
I like this idea, keep your camp wherever you want it, and have a vending machine spot in the whitespring for up to 24 machines. We are already going to all be doing the majority of our vending there. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to also be able to browse all the players selection too?
---
Not to mention, a lot of people want to sell stuff, but dont want to show everyone where their camp is. 
---
No. Give people more places to build, not less.
---
Restricting everyones freedom to build CAMPS just to satiate the desires of a hardcore minority of players is a very dangerous precedent to set.
---
What if the meta changes? No one cares about WS anymore, and they move somewhere else. Now other locations should be made unbuildable because the hardcore elite chose that spot to do their farming and CAMPS interfere with their way of playing the game?
---
Player meta should not be made into rule. 
---
So it's not just me. I get this game running for about, if I'm lucky, two minutes at a go since the patch.
---
And I mean seriously it‚Äôs like you guys didn‚Äôt read either of my post.
---
I keep saying it‚Äôs no longer the best place to farm. If you want the most exp there are better places, if you want the best chance for multi starred legendaries there are better places. Thus there is no reason to farm whitesprings golf club.
---
And do you really think the devs are going to cater to you guys just because you want to be able to farm easier? What a joke, you guys just want it easy, don‚Äôt wanna think it be creative and actually explore, you should play and game better suited for you like Minecraft.
---
No, it's not enough. Staff still working to update, debug, market, create... servers to maintain... no. It needs to continue making money to make it viable.
---
what?
---
Well that stinks. 
---
Flatwoods monster is an alien
---
Xbox sadly. 
---
The primary location I was lead to believe is the train yard in ash heap. And the auxiliary one is the mine just north west of it. 
---
That‚Äôs what I did, and that‚Äôs what people are saying caused it to be packed up.
---
However, I‚Äôve done this before on different camps and it didn‚Äôt do that.
---
According to one person, when you move the camp placer, it moves your fast travel spawn. If you move it to a place where the fast travel spawn doesn‚Äôt work, it will pack it up.
---
This is the best I‚Äôve got so far
---
shitty game design. 
---
The door is locked till you read the poster though. Actually when you're in the area of the parlor the door is locked for everyone in the area apparently. I went to return one of my repeatable quests this morning and the door was locked. I thought, ok great the mission line is glitched out, but then another person came up and the door was locked for them too, and they did the confused emote. Then some level 2 guy wanders up to examine the place. Apparently he hadn't found the poster yet and once he read it on the wall next to the door it unlocked the door for all of us.
---
Still playing/looking..? I have one for sale
---
I saw one player that had the alien blaster in their inventory during the parade event. I haven gone exploring too far so I'm not sure where it came from. I'm on the ps4 if that makes a difference. I am curious too about the location of the alien. I want to get those challenges as well. 
---
I absolutely love the sound of this. Yes please!
---
Ah! There it is. Thank you!
---
I was thinking a Zetan alien like from FO4. 
---
Nice of you to assume I literally ever only farm Whitesprings. I don't. I have a run of locations I find both interesting and lucrative enough to repeat once or twice a day, and it's long enough to not be repetitive but short enough to complete with an hour of XP bonus that the tasty squirrel stew gives me.
---
But I won't lie - Whitesprings is the *easiest* of all to run, as well as the most efficient in terms of time investment and loot you get out of it, obviously also making it the most popular for others. I wait until I don't see anyone there before I fast travel, so hell yeah I will have a problem with people's turrets having a go when it's "my turn" and I spawn the ghouls -  when they're not even there to at least reap the XP from it.
---
It's not about accommodating _me_. This has literally been an ongoing thing since people discovered it, and even play "wasteland justice bringer" tearing these places down. I'm definitely not alone in this annoyance.
---
I wait for sales and use only the atoms I have earned in game. I refuse to pay those outrageous prices. I don't even look at the daily and weekly challenges to look for easy ones to do.
---
It's like you said, I can live without them and spend the money better elsewhere.
---
For this, platform shouldn‚Äôt matter. 
---
The alien is in the Fallout 76 Gaming Guidbook so he‚Äôs definitely in the game Files somewhere. 
---
If you have the Escape Artist card equipped it causes sneak to glitch out and prevents that quest from working. Immediately after I unequipped it the quest worked fine.
---
Are you using core assembly? Looks sick.
---
How much was the mushroom cloud one? 
---
Someone told me before that the Reflex Sights have a lower ap cost attribute. In testing it seemed to be true. 
---
Not yet. Saw that mentioned a little bit ago when I was googling solutions as mentioned above. Will give that a try tonight. Been a busy week and have only gotten to play a couple of times and it was late when I finished each time.
---
What?
---
The alien blaster is in the north part of the map under some radiated water in a safe. Under it is the rusty key used to get into the top room of the costume store
---
500 I think? 
---
I would say bad design lol. Shitty implies the whole thing in my mind lol
---
it's in a safe under some water. i can't remember the names of the nearby locations, but it's close to the butterfly on the map.
---
there's also a key that lets you open a TNT silo that contains ammo for it, and plans to convert it to using standard energy cells (at the loss of some damage)
---
You right but then I might as well trade my TSE shotgun for an automatic weapon build. I get rekt before I can even get close lol
---
I think many will come to find that the 25k cap limit wont be near enough. That is if the only way to purchase items through the vendor, is caps. Those who sell stuff on reddit already know this, thats why many trades, excluding consumables/outfits, are item for item trades. They will either need to up the cap limit significantly, at minimum 4x, or make it a trade vendor also.      
---
I guess with the naming items feature coming, you could name the item you have, its trade price. I.E. I have a powered assassins marine left leg, Id name it 'T-4-BEdragon' (Trade for bloodied explosive dragon) or something like that. This is also assuming that you have to set an actual price on the item so people can see it in the vendor. So id set it to the max cap limit and since I already have max caps it (hopefully) would be unable to sell for the cap price. Worst case is the item sells for max caps and the excess caps go to a 'holding bank' until you spend all your held caps. Im really excited for it. Even if it ends up being not implemented well, its a fantastic step in the right direction. 
---
I might be willing to give up to 300 caps for it. A new player or someone starting a new character might pay a bit more for it. But in general, the level 35 really lowers the value of the item.
---
They announced double exp weekend for survival starting tomorrow and another one later on for survival and Adventure.   I'd give specific but I'm at work on phone.  Someone linked on front page though.
---
I wish you the best of luck. I‚Äôve seen him twice since release lol. 
---
Yea the sbq battles aren‚Äôt a walk in the park, players should be able to continue fighting even when they can‚Äôt beat the clock and get the event reward. 
---
Yeah, uhhh, I'm gonna need you elaborate. 
---
As a person who is always carrying around 50-60 flares and a flare gun for fun, this peaks my intrest.
---
Get a Weapon with Legendaries
---
Prefix : Stalker Major:  +33% VATS hit chance  Minor: 25% less V.A.T.S. Action Point cost 
---
Pimp it up with every Mod that makes Reloading faster
---
Get every Perk Card that makes you reload faster. Vor V.A.T.S. take Grim Reaper Perk Card.
---
Get Speed Demon Mutation
---
Put as many Skill Points as you can into Perception
---
Eat and Drink Perception Buff Items.
---
Result = Perfect VATS. No Ap Cost. 
---
Good Luck finding that weapon xD
---
Vintage Nuka-Shine and a luck got me to Watoga by lvl 8
---
The Alien Blaster can be found in game, it has a static location. Then you need to follow an unmarked quest to gain the plan to change the ammo type to fusion, since alien rounds have small to 0 existence. I've gotten enough Blasters to unlock all Mods for it, if you need it modified for a small fee.
---
Is dog food considered a pre packaged food?
---
Am I the only one that finds it strange pre-war money was worth more 200 years after civilization collapsed than in FO76 which is only 25 years after the bombs dropped?
---
Yeah read the edit I just posted. Those are the old bugged spawns. Check the video I posted, it has a full quest walkthrough that‚Äôll end at Pleasant Valley. I just did this quest the other day so as of like a week ago it worked. 
---
Personally, the first thing I plan on doing with it is selling maxed out level 5 weapons and armor near the overseers camp for peanuts. 
---
Reflex sights (both circle and dot) will reduce your AP cost by a little (around 15% iirc). Also anything with long in the name or a drum magazine will increase your AP costs. 
---
I personally built all the long stuff as the accuracy and range is more important to me. Having crazy AP regen also helps negate the problem. Rejuvenated is a great perk if you carry a lot of water on you. Action boy/girl and lone wanderer are pretty great too.
---
And a third one in the basement of the clinic. 
---
Wtf a legendary flare 
---
Picked this up last Friday. Looking forward to logging in more and more every day.
---
Awesome. :)
---
Terraria?
---
But does it count for both the Flatwoods Monster and Alien kill? I've only seen the Flatwoods Monster twice without the chance to kill the sob.
---
That's always been the case and I hope they never "fix" it. It only works for scrapped plants, not plants directly stored in the inventory, and is quite handy for having a couple of each around for when you need to plant for a crafting session. 
---
Yup. Core assembly + AP legs. The rest of my AP comes from perk cards. 
---
+1. I'm using makeshift warrior and the card that has a chance to repair slightly on hit. I rarely have to repair my super sledge now
---
I think he's saying it should or remove it
---
And use your mic to record the insult for him to deliver
---
I find possums nearby everytime this happens to me.  Could it be them?!
---
yes
---
I guess there is to many issues with survival at this moment. Camping on spawn points, loosing to many caps for death, top three in longest life span showing on the map, advantage of range stealth build over any other and how long you can really enjoy of constant fighting with others, it gets boring. ‚ÄúSurvival‚Äù mode is more a deathmatch at this moment than survivalüòõ 
---
I played new char only on this mode, which has more sense couse to be honest I dont really loose that much and leveling is a bit faster.
---
When your camp is Nuked is it removed?
---
&gt;Deathclaws used to be a fairly tense challenge even for the endgame players and presented a real since of pride when you took them down back in the glory days of FO3 and FONV
---
This is revisionist history. I played 3 not too long ago, and Deathclaws themselves were just as easy to kill, if not maybe even easier in 3/NV's endgame than 76's endgame. The perception of them being really difficult in those games is due to Deathclaws traveling more often in packs in 3 and NV, whereas in 76 they're usually alone. Not to mention that you have teammates helping you in 76 making the fight easier.
---
I‚Äôd love a protectron DJ. With no unique Dialogue sans for an event. 
---
All it does it randomly say the next song. It‚Äôs a fail save bot if the human DJ doesn‚Äôt show for work. *cough, cough their late*. 
---
Event: Radio Star. The bot will randomly give a player a quest to come down to the radio station and let them loot the studio (only one person, no teams) and reward them with a Golden holotape of one of the songs on Appalachia Radio. 
---
Oh, I see. I though it was that they do shoot fireworks. I thought they were removed from the drop table already. Ive never seen a legendary one drop. 
---
I kind of want one, just so I can stop accidentally scrapping mine lol.
---
I'm just really hoping for different color flares someday.
---
Will do. 
---
Oh alright
---
I'm assuming the downvote is because of my high prices, but i guess that's the point of this Post, to help us all gauge what is too expensive and what is too cheap.  Love to hear what a better price would be for these. 
---
Good luck and Godspeed!

I regularly visit Crosshair. 1 bobblehead, 2 magazines, 1 plan and 1 PA all in the same tiny space.  
---
I had a tamed scorched radtoad and I did not enjoy him. He just kept attacking everything and making gross licking noises. Not sure if it was because he was scorched or just angry. I'm not sure what his original level was, but he dropped to level 5
---
Ask Beth.
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying, but I have to disagree. And I‚Äôm not trying to be mean or disrespectful, so please don‚Äôt take it that way. But since they‚Äôve given us a way to earn atoms for free by playing the game, and the stuff in the shop isn‚Äôt OP or required for the game to function, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for you to ask them to give away their long-term source of income for free. 
---
And I know you‚Äôre not asking for all the items to be rewards or loot, but they‚Äôre putting so much stuff into the game (according to the road map), that the few items that do get put into the atom store should have some sort of cost associated with it, whether that‚Äôs real world money, or time to grind out the atoms in-game. 
---
Oh, I see. I'll try the under the bridge spot then
---
I'm curious as to how the money will be transferred. Will it be instant, someone buys something and you see caps pop up, even if you're not there? Or will we be allowed a small 'bank' where we can store a relatively small amount of caps?
---
I prefer the second option. People will complain that it will be a way of storing winnings and then playing PvP with nothing but if you raise the max caps limit it will increase the value that people can effectively trade at and things would go up. This would mean although you can have a small amount of savings you would still need far more to buy weapons etc.
---
If you can kill all variations of a 76 deathclaw by level 10, then YOU might just be the best fallout player of all time.
---
I had no idea player vending was next week , all I heard about was them pooling all vendor caps together, lying Lowe, and item renaming. This is fantastic .
---
Yeah, I have no idea what would have triggered it. I don‚Äôt remember anyone doing anything special. I was just happy it happened and went with it.
---
Adventure
---
Do. It. Meow...
---
Its doing the same to me on on xbox one 
---
There are already a lot of non buildable areas on the map that are set that way to prevent interference with random spawns, so it makes no sense that the Golf Club was not included as a non buildable zone. I would like to see the restriction on CAMP proximity to each other relaxed, that alone would open things up in a lot of areas.
---
It's not, but people seem to play it that way. 
---
Survival is way closer to Arma 2 DayZ than it is to Fortnite. 
---
Someone posted I think last night. Let flare guns scare down normal SB. 
---
I'm really glad I gave this game a shot. Played for almost 40 hours already and having a blast with it.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve got better things to do than to back and forth your logic.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You blocked someone that ended the conversation .. woooo hooo 
---
Thus it costing Atoms instead of caps, which are much more expensive to spam. I mean you could easily put a cool down on it as well to prevent spamming. You can also kill Insult Bot if you don't want to do it.
---
Scrapper card and go to West Tek. Bunch of super mutants are packing assault rifles. Assault rifles scrapped with scrapper perk gives you 20 steel. I usually walk out with 250+ steel from every trip. Plus you run into legendary's inside and outside. Now that Heavy Guns do damage i use this approach to keep 5mm for the Minigun 
---
I have a level 30 Mirelurk King (never seen another). My wife is on her 4th Deathclaw. The current one is a level 21 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è legendary.  It lost the ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù prefix, but kept the stars. 
---
&gt; a piece of three star sentinel armor with AP refresh
---
UFFFFFFF
---
If I come across a weapon I know I'll never use, I put it up in one of the Playstation Fallout 76 communities with the title: Make an Offer"
---
I always get more than the AI vendors will pay 
---
Actually makes sense, it uses magnetic energy to fire a ballistic projectile, so the mutation would still siphon the power off.  It's an energy weapon that fires ballistic projectiles, so sayeth the game files.
---
how about instead we get a Jerry mask from Rick and Morty ? Of course we would also need a Rick mask but you get the point
---
I‚Äôm all for some boxing theme camp decor!
---
I think it sounds awesome! Everyone camped together selling stuff, brewing booze, playing the tuba...
---
Whitesprings will become the next Diamond City.
---
They bugged out the Atomic shop Xmas lights when they added the brewing update, so now they shine that "nuka cola" on the walls from the lamp. To me that either indicates that it will be in the shop eventually or they just screwed up an asset somewhere. 
---
I'll mostly be selling unwanted legendareis and ammo so my stuff will likely be cheap for the most part. The rarer stuff might go for 500c.
---
What I meant was power armor gets different colors and brighter versions which help a lot. The pipboy light is poor for lighting up darker areas from what I remember when the game was darker. 
---
That "nice lake" has a ton mirelurks. Your defenses will be busy keeping your camp intact.
---
I got the same free item too, never bought any skins though
---
Sorry, that link wants me to sign up for Tumblr
---
You‚Äôre undercutting yourself on water unless you‚Äôre providing a service to your fellow vault dwellers. Purified water sells to vendors for more than what you‚Äôre asking from players.
---
I wouldn't have thought about that considering how fast they eat up AP, but I guess the fire rate would do that alone. I'll try to test it out and find an automatic receiver that I can tap, or at lease manage small burts.
---
Also for the love of GOD add MORE Unruly F@#KING Golfers!
---
AP doesn't regen while using VATS though right? I'm thinking the more shots in VATS the more kills I get and the more likely Grim Reaper Sprint activates.
---
I'd give one for free but you cant trade atom shop items (not sure tho)
---
Ive joined all the discord channels and sub reddits for trading.... Have yet to find a person willing to trade weapons for caps.  Ever person I talk to whos on those sites selling stuff is maxed out on caps, and is only looking for item trades.   
---
No, I stopped playing. I'll be getting back into it soon though. You can add me if you want, we can find ppl
---
I love it! Just wish they‚Äôd work on camps a bit, they need work (clipping, freedoms, etc.)
---
Q on PC but as far as I know that is for Atomic shop items only.
---
I'm pretty sure if u didn't buy it and u apply to it armor Bethesda might confiscate the armor
---
Same with the spot I‚Äôm at north of whitespring station, there‚Äôs a shack nearby with 4 supermutants that keep attacking. Thanks for the info, I won‚Äôt build there then 
---
Keep trying...
---
Wrong sub
---
Sub?
---
You can do that, meanwhile I‚Äôll keep my nice lakeside view. :)
---
Give us atoms for "mastering" each weapon. 
---
Unfortunately Flatwoods is in the green zone.
---
Is it a skin in the shop? I couldn't find it when i looked
---
So?
---
I would recommend trying r/market76, you might have better chances
---
It is what it's called, a survival mode with unrestricted PvP. What are you honestly expecting? "Oh hey man, nice gun. Wanna team up an go quest?" 
---
No. If you go to Survival, you're levelling, or PvP'ing.
---
Remember kids seeing anyone do anything fun is fortnite. Anyone messing around and faffing about is fortnite. Anyone being silly and not super serious like OP here is a fortnite player. Seriously let people play how they want. Not all of us are edgy 30 year old military men who want their games to be badass and serious, nothing is wrong with a game being silly 
---
ill forgive you for not actually reading my post title and my post contents.  if you did you would notice i said "some" repeatedly never "all"
---
Flares and Drills are still dropping.
---
Definitely. As a melee build I'd love to use it but lvl 20 just isn't good enough. 
---
"Hey, asshole! You're listening to Raider Radio." &lt;3
---
It's definitely coming. That entire section of the quest felt like an advertisement for Nuka Cola stuff coming to the Atom Shop.
---
Would be a good idea, but a bit of a cheat if you can just log off when there's an incoming strike to get out of the zone on re-entry. 
---
I moved my camp near Whitesprings station yesterday and didn't have trouble with mutants although I might not have been long enough to attract them.  I'll set up the turrets pointing in their direction.
---
Really, anywhere along that road should be pretty convenient to travelers.  
---
if you dont see the issue with this then then no use explaining it
---
Maybe blind them for a couple seconds.
---
First, a lot of the players with Turret Camps behind the Golf Club, are not even farming XP, because they are off somewhere else while their turrets are killing the ghouls that someone else spawned.
---
I play a lot with a large group (8-12 players), so we very seldom Server Hop, unless there are issues with the one we are on, but when I do play alone I sometimes server hop to locate random spawns or events. I have never concentrated my efforts on leveling, I'm sitting on 8 unused levels right now, but instead I travel around hunting Legendaries and Events, the WS is just one of many locations, and I tend to go there when I see no other players in the area, just to sometimes be disappointed by a pile of dead enemies that no one got anything from because of the Turret Camp.
---
I mean, if they could produce it why wouldn‚Äôt  they? I probably could, yeah! It‚Äôs my profession and my hobby lol. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs still quite a bit to license the Beach Boys and John Denver

---
My buddy and I ran into this last night. I had the quest, he didn't. We logged off / on, he tuned into the radio station - nada. 
---
I have all the repair quests but he doesn't.
---
This. It's what makes games like Borderlands, Crackdown so much fun, the freedom to play how YOU want to play, one reason why i absolutely love DayZ. A game where players have choice is a game where each character/player literally creates his/her own story.

That lake pretty regularly spawns high level mirelurks and Super Mutants. I was built there and moved. A better spot is the woods behind Lewisburg.

lol better than the zealots machete but I‚Äôm always in PA and don‚Äôt do pvp so it‚Äôs a nice souvenir :P 
---
In order to keep down server lag and prevent scamming, custom item names are stored client side for only you to see. I kind of doubt they will allow the machine to sell for items since that can get wildly complicated to program in. Though in person trading could still work.
---
It was actually on sale last night. Might still be. I think half off? I went ahead and got it.

There does appear to be a Refined one, though...

wait, it's a GUN? i thought it was something lame, like a hat... which, given it's icon is a gun, is kind of stupid of me to assume. well damn, now i'm gonna want to get it. any recommendations on racking up crits before the week ends, besides the shotgun trick?
---
The "Charging Shotgun Barrel" is a distinct thing from the "Shotgun Barrel."
---
i have to agree, , as i missed the tiled mosaic floor plans and have been hoping they bring them back someday, i started paying after they came out and then subsequently removed from the atom store
---
havent done them myself but since every other challenge is account-based and not character-specific i‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs only one for your whole account
---
That makes a lot more sense now.  I literally thought it was to toggle showing me mods I haven't found yet.
---
Welcome to PC gaming.
---
You might be thinking of a different spot. Outside the raider arena there are a bunch of stalls that have armor plans. There might be recipes as well... Anyway...

Yes, and it looks very nice.

Similar to fallout 4's workshop DLC? Thst's what i want, more building choices. Maybe a garage door with a double switch style so you can open an close from both inside/outside. Some new building sets like how we have wood/barn/warehouse/metal etc. I'd like some reinforced glass, definitely better roof options.
---
Thanks for putting in the work to attempt to figure out how loot drops are based, but RNG is RNG, pull the lever on the slot machine and hope you're a winner. Personally I do not believe drops are based on anything your character has equipped,stored, or what time of the day or night it is....it is completely random. I don't care about it enough to make charts and get percentages when at the push of a button Bethesda can change either how many enemies in a particular area are legendary, what their star count is, and the likelihood of a god roll item. 
---
Bethesda and other game companies are all about keeping you playing as long as possible, the best way to do this is the "carrot on a stick" method and trust they are doing this. "Oh look at 3\* Enemy!!...Finally!!" you kill it and what do you get? 1 Diamond/Perk Wood Armor or a Hunter's Pipe Pistol.....You know this is true and the Reason being is Whitespring Resort (When Nuked) has been farmed so hard the soil has turned to sand and spreading across the entire game world, because once you have everything or are satisfied with your build you won't play as often, as a result we get crap loot on the regular, even from 3\* enemies that should be dropping loot according to their star count. Someone has to ruin  for everyone and that's what happen over at Whitespring Resort and the game is much grindier because of that stupid location at one point be a hot spot to farm at....Now we all suffer.
---
You realize our *FREE DLC* is funded by the Atom Shop?
---
I buy stuff in the Atom Shop. I wouldn't if I could get it as loot. Why? Because I would be really fucking angry if I spent $5.00 on something and it dropped from an event an hour later. 
---
The Atom Shop is reasonably priced, we have challenges, and there's a huge amount of cosmetics freely available in-game already. 
---
To the person below me commenting that we do not get enough from challenges:
---
You said
---
&gt;Eventually all that's left that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time is daily and weekly challenges which only give you a rather small amount of atoms if you do all of them (60 for daily and 150 for weekly).
---
That's 570 Atoms per week, minimum, doing dailies and weeklies. That's not bad at all.
---
Bethesda needs income. The Atom Shop is one of the most fair implementations of micro-transactions we've seen in recent Online games. 
---
Let them make the money they need to provide us with the content we want.
---
Blinding would be cool. 
---
i agree!!!!
---
a 1000 ATOM point item directly translates to $10 in real life $$$
---
that is just crazy HORSE ARMOR prices
---
I am usually laughing too hard to kill him.
---
I read that they are adding all factions' vendor bots to the Whitesprings retail hall and that they are pooling the cap limit into a 1400 cap mega-limit for all factions.  
---
That's going to make it much easier to sell off your old junk, flooding the market with caps and driving up prices. Whatever prices have been at now should change drastically both in game and in Reddit. 
---
I got a 3* zealots knuckle from it with reduced weight and power attack damage
---
Absolutely. They wouldn't harm the storyline at all.
---
Quick swap was definitely busted when they tried to make it automatically swap out of broken weapons to another weapon you had. 
---
Yeah, i get that. I haven't got round to the fine tuning yet, its a new build. i'll get my tape measure out soon - promise ;)
---
Many of the Turrets I've seen there will shoot the Ghouls through the windows, and the spawn is triggered by a player entering the area from a good ways off, so unless you are sprinting to the golf club, most will be dead before you get to them.
---
Can‚Äôt be the amount of remaining HP, she flew away when there was probably 1% left in some past battles I did. Everyone was like Noooooooo... 
---
I don't think I have a case because the charge was delayed and the extra Atoms didn't show up right away, so I accidentally spent some of them. That's why they're refusing to refund me. They won't even partially refund me.
---
lol ps4? can i buy it
---
if you're curious about what the general market is, check out r/Market76. obviously there will be outliers, but you can definitely get a general feel of what things are going for over there.
---
I highly recommend checking it out to avoid the surprise of some pricing. it gets pretty annoying when people only want to pay me significantly less than i paid for my hunter's long coats.
---
They really need to give us a way to bulk ammo for sale. I'm not going to pay 1 cap each for something like .308 or 5.56, but I'd buy 100 or them for 75 caps.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea! I‚Äôm gonna start doing that, also maybe some weapons I no longer in need of!
---
This needs healing tons of upvotes and reposts.
---
If you're on a PC, there's [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124).
---
You'd rather our updates and DLC be funded with a subscription instead of optional micro-transactions for cosmetics? 
---
Or would you rather pay for every individual DLC/Update instead?
---
The people spending money on the Atom Shop are quite literally funding the development of the game you're playing. 
---
Complaining about the Atom Shop, in a game with a years worth of *free* major updates fully road-mapped, is absurd.
---
Reported it, and thanks for the tag....  
---
What is unclear is why the perk isn't effecting the VATS (aka double core)
---
The out of VATS regen speed is also pretty damn high. Actually give me a couple of minutes to open the game and i'll time it. 
---
Subreddit.  
---
Try r/market76 or r/fo76bazaar
---
If that's your argument, notice how I said "It's like" you want atom shop gone. I forgive you as well
---
i see you must be too young to remember the Bethesda debacle over HORSE ARMOR
---
.....lest we forget, feel free to google it
---
besides this is a !#$@*$ AAA game company, who charged FULL $60 for the game, and it released in the universally agreed upon state of utter shite...and still has microtransactions
---
they are not a struggling small developer, trust me, they are not hurting for $$$
---
I'm just hoping I don't have to visit each vending machine/camp just to see what's for sale!
---
I don't want to spend caps fast traveling just to browse someone's legendary rolling pin collection!
---
Yes, I've seen this behavior too.
---
I don't know if anything has really changed with her lately, but I can actually see myself doing damage to her now, so that's nice (Executioner's Sledgehammer, which is probably kicking out about 1,800 a whack with a power attack).  If a few players bring Cryolators to keep her on the ground, it seems possible to beat her even in your scenario... if others actually help.  Players who just show up to fight the horde suck.
---
sorry, but that is not the same, good try though
---
It seems to require low level players to enter the area in order for them to spawn, I see them frequently and they are always level 7-12, never higher.
---
I don't think they will spawn for players over level 35.
---
Funny enough I brought the exact same thing up in another thread recently. Glad to find out ammo smith works the same way.
---
I'm sure they have big plans for it, I can't imagine they'd crash a space station and not have more alien involvement or event related to entering it.
---
I need them fusion cores baby!
---
As u/Shaddax_ mentioned it's a reported issue, tested and reproducible to a certain extended.  
---
VATS chews through FC's like crazy, and does not seem effected by the Perk card at all unfortunately, and the drain does seem higher.  
---
I am personally, non-VATS, burning through a few 25% cores per 3 or so hours, so 75% of a fully charged core.
---
Ah right, I could see it. Still with item to item trading as it is now, you can be just as easily scammed. Maybe they will eventually update the player trade window for item to item trades then. I'm just glad they are making efforts in the right places.
---
id really them rather fix the base game we paid for already, before they start to sheckel 
---
its crazy how people defend shareholder/corporate worst practices
---
consumer rights and common sense really have been forgotten
---
"Unavailable" without any modifier is exactly that, unavailable. It's not pessimistic, it's a statement taken at face value. That said, I did not notice the hover text when you select the Leaving Soon tag previously, but I point out that "heading back to the Vault" does not imply temporary removal either. And while I like to think that nobody is stupid enough to remove possible income, human stupidity is boundless. So I made my post for what it was, an opinion. To be honest, if I had seen any of the older short sale items come back into rotation, I'd not have bothered posting it.
---
Pretty awesome eh?
---
id really them rather fix the base game we paid for already, before they start to sheckel
---
Xbox unfortunately 
---
How is it not the same? it shows you didn't read my comment thoroughly
---
I've played every Bethesda game since Morrowind. 
---
Honestly, by bringing up horse armor right now, I feel like your entire opinion is informed by memes. 
---
FO76 released in a horrible state. It's *massively* improved since release and right now it's an excellent game. We're receiving huge content updates and QoL improvements regularly. 
---
As you've said, FO76 had a horrible launch. Without MTX through the Atom Shop, the game would die. Purely off sales, *it did not bring in enough money to sustain itself for years*. 
---
If you don't want any MTX in this game, especially fair, easily grindable, and purely optional cosmetics, get ready for the servers to go down within a year because it's not turning a profit.
---
Yea ps4 but I‚Äôm keeping them as souvenirs for now lol Maybe when my stash is too full. 
---
Gods, I have soooo much imitation seafood on my character that I am thinking about opening a cheap sushi cart &gt;.&lt;
---
I usually have 50+ dog food as well, I just sold a bunch to get it back to a reasonable number.
---
I have a small farm that I use (with perks) to keep me fed and hydrated for longish play sessions, so I don't even know why I keep picking them up.  But I do.  Maybe I'll be opening a restaurant when player vending comes out...anyone interested in Krab sticks and Alpo goulash surprise?
---
I'd love to buy an Ultracite gatling laser plan for 1500c *cries*
---
nope, if you take stuff you'll need to wait 5-8 hours
---
Oh man I like this idea!!!!
---
I would freak way harder than someone nuking my camp
---
&gt;id really them rather fix the base game we paid for already
---
Have you not played in the past 3 months?
---
This is a game with open ini files and a large history of modding. The difference between a cheat and a mod is player use. An anti-cheat fo76 is an fo76 without mods. 
---
Eek, not safe.  I killed a guy in such a situation before (didn't know until after) he dropped so much aid that I needed 3 friends to carry it all lol.   You can do the challenges on an alt in the future :)
---
most world items go on a 24 hour timer once looted.  So it's best to have a few spots in mind to farm any given resource.  
---
High schools are a good source of plastic and I'm sure searching this sub will yield other suggestions.
---
VATS, sprinting, jetpack all use a lot of power (not sure about VATS, but I've heard that as well).
---
Yes, power cores drain with AP usage, VATS drains AP. So does jumping, sprinting, power attacking.
---
If you dedicate points to batteries included and power user it largely becomes a non issue, but that's a lot of INT points. 
---
Grahm get shiny box. Grahm uses shiny box to make noise. Grahm get rich!
---
you can spawn them at higher levels. Finally completed that quest with a level 120 character.
---
Two things:
---
Be at Whitespring entirely alone (difficult)
---
Be there when it has been empty for a good few minutes. (really freaking difficult)
---
Realistically it's going to rely on a little luck. A nice quiet server.
---
Alternatively, try heading to WS during Scorched Earth, chances are most of the session will be at Fissure Prime.
---
Either way, no matter your level you can spawn the level 9's, it seems to require more than one person at WS to increase the level of the ghouls.
---
Used to be that anyone could get items from supply drops, who knows why Beth hasn't changed it to only prompt the player who requested said supply drop
---
You dont get xp unless you tag them, you still get loot. 
---
Yeah that's silly. I'm level 152 and I'm 1 shy from completing that quest.
---
Just count how many bullets you used. I can either shoot 6 with a semi 10mm or 12 with an automatic 10mm before AP is empty.
---
If you use concentrated fire perk, you need to tap the trigger even with automatics due to some shitty latency bug. It can take next to a full second before vats registers you are at 95% accuracy. Once you there, you just hold the trigger though.
---
Unfortunately no, BUT you can expand what you grab for plastic, I didn't know till I tagged it for search. Coffee makers, packs of cigarettes, cartons of cigarettes, golf balls, and bowling pins all give plastic. I never run short now. 
---
If it‚Äôs not this place it will just be the next place. If it bothers you, nuke the zone, then they won‚Äôt have a camp.
---
Like I said, the devs aren‚Äôt going to accommodate something that just benefits farming, so don‚Äôt hold your breath, especially when fixing this problem will result in the same problem, just somewhere else.
---
Okay so without well-fed bonus it takes about 8 seconds to fully regen my AP while standing. 
---
If i'm moving it goes down to ~6.5 seconds.
---
With well fed bonus standing still is about 7 seconds.
---
Moving around is 5 seconds.
---
These tests are actually extremely unrealistic. To get by AP bar down i had to spam the VATS key, otherwise i would get random 25% AP increases and it would be near impossible to get down to 0 naturally. 
---
Even while timing the regen speed, sometimes it takes as little as 4 seconds, other times it needs a bit more. 
---
Either way, the regen speed is good enough so you won't suffer from AP loss during combat. 
---
Avoiding griefers, looking for a high level party or a more stable server are entirely appropriate. Spending hours gaming the system to re-roll the rng loot is pure cheese. In single player fallout it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but if I want to play PVP competitively I‚Äôm now forced to ‚Äúplay‚Äù the game your way, which is sad because it will not only rob me of the experience but everyone else who doesn‚Äôt want to cheese their way to perfect legendaries and loot. That‚Äôs also not even taking into account how this could effect the economy if the game expands further in that direction. 
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an exploit, it‚Äôs not cheating!‚Äù Sure, on a technical level people would be right and I can‚Äôt argue the semantics, but it all just seems wrong to me and it‚Äôs unfortunate that people accept it as normal to abuse the imperfect system as it is. 
---
Well watching my naked character get hit with nukes was interesting at least lol
---
That is no excuse to further limit buildable space. 
---
The only reason some people ask for this is because sometimes someone might place a base with turrets there and hogs in on the mob spawn. Those who are inconvenienced by this now want rules to be changed to suit them
---
The fact that WS gets nuked so often and high level enemies are around is a direct inconvenience to all low level players for whom WS is something theyre suppose to go to at low level, and soon WS is also going to be a defacto hub.
---
So perhaps we should just make WS untargetable by nukes instead. 
---
Thank you. I've been hoarding 90 level of chems and didn't know how much to sell them.
---
I'll be using your pricelist as a basis.
---
Id nuke my camp to save myself from the molerats.
---
Been there... Even just a gift emote would be helpful.
---
You get an alert when there's no more scorched, not when there *are* scorched.  Once they're all gone, you'll know.^^/s
---
It was just story flavor, there isn't any actual alarm, or it would pretty much be going off non-stop.  They've kind of taken over, if you hadn't noticed ;-)
---
Honestly think those prices are fair for those items considering the hassle and actual cost for getting long coats. The beret i don't know because I heard some people got a lot of them but I ended up 1/75...
---
My hope is that there will eventually be a player wipe once it goes from beta to official.  
---
Then, once it's officially live they will have "seasons" where characters only last a certain time horizon or the items will be radically rebalanced for this game mode.
---
Yo, ign name for when it goes live!?
---
Do a vendor hub and I'll nuke the hell out of it for the glory of Atom.
---
I‚Äôve noticed some weirdness with PA recently adding mods.  Being given x-01 options for mods I didn‚Äôt have when I only had a bright headlamp.
---
I doubt they would have abandon 76 after 3 months...
---
Practically giving away those legendaries at those prices XD.
---
Yea it‚Äôs pretty cool especially when you‚Äôre the only one whacking her. If everyone is shooting it‚Äôs harder to tell. Some says her hp is 100k, it‚Äôs definitely a lot higher than that. I think a lot of players genuinely want to help, it‚Äôs just the big mob of high levels is too overwhelming and most people weren‚Äôt ready for it. 
---
Do they ever make fun of you and call you a fan boy?
---
My favorite looking weapon is the hatchet with the bused open fusion core duck taped to it. 
---
Mods don't necessarily mean cheating. You wouldn't call something like Cheat Engine a mod. That's no the nature of what mods are at all.
---
For a more optimized card build.
---
I might have to add you to my contacts. I want to build that decom shower too
---
I think it works for armor, but not for guns. 
---
They don't actually üòÇ the one who makes fun is the fanboy. I don't care I'm enjoying it can't wait till next weeks update
---
I have tried going to that flatwood motel weight room on 3 different servers and its always totally cleaned out. Ugh. 
---
Shhhhh, don't tell people about the golf balls. 40 a session quite regularly;)
---
But yeah, there are a few surprising things that hold plastic. Pool table balls, which I would've thought would be ceramic or bone even are plastic sources.
---
If it‚Äôs not whitesprings it will happen somewhere else. Next thing you will see turret camps at west tek and general‚Äôs steakhouse or whatever popular spot. Just because someone beat you there or is camping just there or there camp is there killing everything doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong and against the game rules. It‚Äôs not against the rules anywhere, just against some forced morality code that the devs don‚Äôt care about.
---
Where?
---
Please do tell. How did you get that amazing tacky carpet. I need it. 
---
I'm glad this isn't a traditional MMO too ...  Copying the progression based raid systems of World of Warcraft can only be done so many times
---
i guess we are playing different games... 
---
just look at all the bug fix requests every day here, ones that were created by previous bug fixes
---
look, i love this franchise as much as anyone, but it doesnt blind me to what is really going on, fanboyism doesnt help anyone
---
I had issues as well but I managed to do it with help
---
Ah, good to know. Many thanks to you and the others for the input. 
---
This is good to know! I thought since carnivore made veggies useless that only packaged meat products would work. Guess Ive missed out on free meals üò≠
---
If it's just you, repair and/or reinstall would be my first step (also check out drivers, not just graphics card, but definitely that.  New or rolled back ones for GPU).
---
If it was everyone...you'd know ;-)
---
Yeah, lowbies with their audio turned off, and trying to gift them something might drink me crazy. They are so scared of a high level most of the time
---
holy shit am i really going to have to do this?
---
i stated unequivocally, you inferred from my statement.  BIG difference m8
---
there. happy?
---
Are these friends? If not, why even hold onto these for so long?
---
Scaleform is the UI rendering library, so you should first check that you're not running any mods. Find and destroy any copies of Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
If you have a mic, try talking, even if the other person doesn't have one. I keep my chat audio set to area even though I don't usually run around with a mic, so I can hear everyone else and respond with emotes as appropriate. 
---
I miss being able to VATS jump to turrets, it was so cool, now it‚Äôs just me standing on the floor jumping and failing to get the timing correct :( 
---
Rare? I dropped 2 into the Watoga station suitcase before I logged off today. 
---
Doing **serious** stash spring cleaning.
---
Sure thing! IGN TheHoboSeer
---
I am not saying that. I am saying that the same thing that allows us to mod the game allows for easy cheating. Mods can modify textures, remove objects, etc. 
---
A common F4 mod removed grasses. This helped people with slow comps. Well guess what. If you remove all the foliage in the game it makes it really easy to see someone in pvp who is trying to not be seen by using cover. 
---
Another common mod is to make certain textures glow. Well what if those textures are armor textures, or the chameleon effect.
---
If you block the ability to cheat you have to lockdown the game files. If you do that we don't get mods.
---
[Generally speaking this is correct](https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2018/articles/2018-11-18-17-11/fallout_76_level_zones_map.jpg) although things are influenced by the players that were there before you. Higher level players can travel through many of those areas and end up triggering some higher level spawns.
---
You may have better luck up north for at least a few levels or until you get some really good legendary items to use for a bit.
---
ugh between the duping and this its kinda sad really
---
You can still eat veggies and get the benefit from them (Like cranberry relish for the XP boost), you just will not get your food meter replenished from doing so.
---
Same here - though too afraid to try and add it, that they are just showing me the "option"   and if I add it, they'll deduct it from my atomic shop balance. They mentioned it in the patch notes:  
---
* **Localization:** **The ‚ÄúToggle Unlockable‚Äù and ‚ÄúView in Atomic Shop‚Äù options while previewing unowned Atomic Shop items in a Workbench no longer display placeholder text when running Fallout 76 in languages other than English.**  
---
*  [https://bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019)    
---
* So does that mean, I can see what it will look on my armor in game, and if I apply it they deduct from me?    Someone who has less than the cost should try it,  I am a hoarder so it would absolutely deduct from my current balance   
---
The fact that this is still a problem is mind boggling.
---
Oh cool thanks, so I should wander around the West and North? Are there quests and stuff to do there?
---
platform?
---
I dunno.  This "item's here . . . then it's not" behaviour has got me spooked.  Plus, the Tech Data inventory handling has changed since game launch.  The first week of play, I had 5 + Tech Data's in inventory (only one marked as a quest item).  Early in week two, all but the quest one disappeared . . . along with my modified Body Armour torso.  
---
Unfortunately I don't remember how hard this quest was for me. But I know at lower levels just make sure you aren't going into an area close to high level players. Since they will spawn high level enemies. The savage divide is a higher level spawn zone tho. 
---
I'm not a fanboy.
---
 I *enthusiastically* hated on this game until a few months ago.
---
You just want free cosmetics, and you're pissed. 
---
Acting like Bethesda isn't making massive improvements to the game regularly just makes you sound like a whiny child.
---
The game actually only has a handful of side quests besides the main story so far. Up north there are a couple I believe.
---
The biggest thing is events, and workshops (which spawn Defend the workshop events). You can do those for a decent amount of XP.
---
Unfortunately the perk seems to "top out" quickly when combined with tank killer and an anti-armor rifle.  One rank seems to provide some small bonus, but not enough that it's worth stopping the action and swapping perks.
---
I can make you the 10mm. I should be home in about 3 hours. Add me if you still need it onepompousa55
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the info!
---
I'm on PS4, yourstruly0. My camp is a little northeast of White Powder Winter Sports, under a power line tower, though I might move it later on.
---
Thanks, I'll do that!
---
Get griefed by a couple god leveled players, and us low level players learn to just stay away from/server hop from anyone else to avoid losing what we have.  Most people just wave, which I take as a nice gesture.  I wave back and run the heck away asap
---
Doesn't change the fact you didn't read my comment before replying
---
lol true, in my defense I found the thread trough gogle so I asummed it was relevant :P
---
https://xboxclips.com/TANAAS/ce8933ba-78eb-441a-86e2-6ead6d24f718
---
Each area of the map has a range of levels enemies can spawn. The savage divide can spawn up into the 50s I believe. The level they spawn at is related to the level of players in the area. So if someone high level came through before you and didn't clear out the enemies, they stayed high. To do quests that our out of your range as far as levels go, keep an eye on the server and watch for players going to the areas you need to go to. Or, a couple times, I waiting until really late at night or really early in the morning to do a quest so there wouldn't be a bunch of people on the server. 
---
If you don't want to do that, then I recommend leveling up some more. The Toxic valley up north is appropriate to your level, followed by the ash heap to the south. Then on to the savage divide. The mire in the north east is the next hardest followed by the cranberry bog in the south east which is the hardest area.
---
IGN: Shankwell.  I have Schrute Farms near the Whitesprings Station.  We can be neighbors!
---
Bless you
---
I don‚Äôt know much about this specific situation but if your friend hasn‚Äôt already submitted a bug report tell them to do so. https://help.bethesda.net/
---
I got the same thing. Which I imagine everyone does too.  Was prob meant to be a daily event/challenge that wasn‚Äôt program correctly and is a minor issue way down on the bottom of the list. No harm so why fix it right, that‚Äôs my guess.
---
They messed with it a couple patches ago because everyone complained I just made a habit of going out all day looting scavenging and exploring, then getting back to camp and going through everything from that day. I wish it was still nice and dark and felt like night time rather then full moon in an area just outside of a well lit city m, this is the end of the world. There‚Äôs no real sources for light pollution beside thee moon. If there was a moon phases type of thing then that would be awesome. 
---
Full moon= what it looks like now
---
New moon= what it looked like back at launch 
---

Its account based- I just got it on my main and its greyed out  
---

---
Maybe you could tag the ones you want to do, and then when they pop up you get a notification.
---
Actually, lore wise, using those stupid voting machines for something real would be kinda cool
---
this is my thought as well
---
Someone shot at a brown bag near me to get my attention.  Trading is REALLY hard to figure out, and I just finally managed to successfully trade at level 18. 
---
I suggest brown bagging gifts.  Speaking for myself, I have had some real *interesting* people request being on a team.  And then would have to leave the server.  So I am suspicious of randos and team invites.
---
Ah. The way it‚Äôs said threw me off. Fair enough. Thanks. 
---
For violet I think the best is to nuke toxic valley make sure to catch wack Willard‚Äôs in the nuke, and cover the hemlock holes maintenance workshop in the west.  
---
After the nuke take the workshop and it‚Äôll do the defend, that will send a bunch of things at you for get the materials. 
---
Afterwards head up the road to Willard‚Äôs, tons of nuked ferns on the way, work your way through Willard‚Äôs killing the scorched and collecting their material. Then work yourself back to the workshop looping around the south of the nuke zone, pick up everything and hopefully the workshop will go off again and give you some more material.  
---
I did this got at least 200 ferns and converted them all, although I may have had some material before. 
---
Whitesprings is good for everything else and for the materials, I go every time I see a nuke there even if just to clean up after others.  Prime is good for violet as well but I can never get enough materials. I think because we target it just right to put everything outside the nuke.  
---
Even if I do complete it, next time I‚Äôm even remotely in the area I get it again. It‚Äôs not really worth worrying about.
---
Nicely done, I‚Äôll be on in a few, but only for like 15 mins as I have to go to work.
---
This is the best, simplest explanation I've heard so far, thank you. 
---
Sounds go to me !
---
this issue has been in the game since 4, and given Bethesda's track record of fixing weapons...probably never. 
---
genius. I wonder though if Beth might adjust the vendor pricing based on such transactions because that will lead to a glut of caps in the market leading to MORE inflation.
---
IGN mcgivens82
---
No. No. No.
---
JUst puttin' it out there as an opposing voice. Screw that. I want locked perks. Let us respect at say, lvl 50 and every 50 levels after, or something. 
---
But what is the point of building a character, if you can change it at whim? Might as well just let everyone do everything. Level 20? Boom. All level 20 skills open now. Seriously. Changing perk cards makes builds irrelevant.
---
Sounds like a hell of a lot more fun to me than being vendor number four thousand on the "chems and scrap vendor" list. 
---
[https://imgur.com/ckovbGD](https://imgur.com/ckovbGD)
---
Amazing work bro. What I‚Äôve found out is that the legendary effects come in clusters. Sometimes I get several with the same prefixes in a row. If it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for, great I will stay on that server as long as possible and travel to all locations and do events. If it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt use much, like junkies and stalkers, I log off and hop server because I know there will be more of those if I stay longer. 
---
Oh yeah for sure.  If bulk sale comes out you can toss all these prices, and failing that we can just work out deals in person.
---
Fun fact, it's not just me,  (as evidenced by this fucking post???) I HAVE repaired the game (three times, just to be sure). 
---
The game worked before the update, it stopped working with the update, it also doesn't work on another computer. 
---
The natural progression is broken. The quests will point you in the direction of Whitesprings and Pleasant Valley somewhere between level 15 and 25, where you'll get slaughtered by max-level enemies because those areas are scaled to the highest nearby player. It worked better in the BETA because most players were a similar level.
---
My recommendation would be to shelve the main quest lines and go exploring instead. Stick to the Forest until it's too easy. Then head north to the Toxic Valley. Then south to the Ash Heap. These places are mostly level-locked. Try any event you run into, and maybe some workshops, although those do potentially expose you to PvP.
---
I dont use AA rifle. I use instigating. For me, the extra front loaded damage is what puts most things into 1 shot kill territory. If I know I am going to fight a pile of bugs, mirelurks, etc I will often equip it in place of tank killer or concentrated fire.
---
For my setup... 5 shots = 5 dead crickets or ants with exterminator on.
---
If I had a AA hunting rifle or lever action I would definitely give it a go, but I have to use what I got.
---
Wow thats still going on, i would have figured theyd patch that by now. 
---
What all came with the camo bundle? I got it the other day and i too can put woodland camo on my right leg only
---
It is good news. Now i have a new strat for griefers who camp my station and take it. Fuck.em. im nuking
---
I don‚Äôt know much about this specific situation but if you haven‚Äôt already submitted a bug report do so. https://help.bethesda.net/
---
I mean, that's nice for you, being all polite and shit? In my mind, a game mechanic that gives people quests that makes them wanted without, very clearly, outlining what will happen if you take that quest is...wait for it. 
---
Fucking _shitty_ game design, that there is no excuse for. 
---
I heard they were just gonna trash it after all the bad reviews, I‚Äôm glad they stuck with it. Great job Bethesda!
---
I believe I have a lvl 50 bloodied 3* .44 in my inventory. I can check Saturday when I get back on if you're interested. May be a few other pistols as well, I'm a bit of a hoarder. 
---
Its a repeatable quest like technical docs. Still haven't done it once.
---
To prevent People making a full army of Gary's. 
---
But to make the perfect build, how do u have room for the crafting perks or even the perks for when ur just wandering around? Plus I wouldn't run the same perks in survival mode that I would in adventure
---
Guess I'll park my main and get my alt into survival mode so he can level up and work toward his dream of creating a high end music festival on a deathclaw island and selling tents, er, villas on the beach.
---
I think everything is usually slower in power armor but don‚Äôt quote me on that.
---
You still could.
---
Please give us better gear that requires higher levels to make all duped items obsolete.
---
That will also make these double xp weekends worth it.
---
I've knoticed that as well, it seems everything is slower to include reloading almost all weapons.
---
same ting happened to me today when i bought some PA mods from someone. I had a camo skin that i havent bought.
---
I swap from an instigating slow firing hunting rifle to an anti armor handmade for tight quarters and large groups. No matter what, crickets are apex predators in WV. They move so damn fast and have very high perception.
---
I‚Äôll probably sell everything as the game marks it as, I‚Äôve got a lot of plans I don‚Äôt need 
---
I suppose it's mostly for us users. To quickly identify our characters un the selection, if we have more than one or two. 
---
I haven't gotten a reward for completing it, and it's always open when I log in?
---
This has happened to me many times.  I can initiate a trade but others cannot, all they do is end up jumping around in front of me. (Xbone)
---
wow, so I asked if they could let "SOME" if the stuff we want be able to get in game,not ALL of it..
---
and then you accuse me of wanting free stuff?!?!?  
---
i kind of feel sorry for you really, good luck with life there bud
---
  Follow the overseers quest line.  Do events.
---
  Stick to the forest until about L20, then go north to the toxic valley.  
---
In the upper 20s, you may be OK at on the western side of the divide, but critters there will level depending on whos been around.  
---
Noone?  you'll get L6 scorched and L20 mutants.  
---
L50+ been around, you'll get L40+ mutants.
---
At 30, start exploring the ash heap.
---
Save the eastern edge of the divide and points east until L40.
---
Depending on your build and weapons, you may be able to do a WS nuke run in the 20s, but it wil not be easy.
---
You're in a server cluster when you hop servers. You aren't getting randomized access across all active games.
---
I looted two code pieces off of a scorched last night because the beeping annoys me.  Damned things would duplicate every time I fast travel.  Ended my session with around 40 of them in my inventory.  I hope this doesn't continue through the whole week.
---
Show proof of cheating. If no proof of cheating then how can i believe this?
---
Except that it doesn't because you can earn a bunch of atoms in the game. I've earned over 8000 from playing and doing challenges and still have nearly 5000 left after buying everything I was remotely interested in. 
---
So for right now, 1000 atoms equals $0.00 for me and probably will for some time. Atoms will only start equating to actual money when I finally buy some at which point 1000 atoms will equal far less than $10. Like, way less.
---
I see you accepted. You ready to run though it real quick or no?
---
100% agree OP. Bethesda give us robot companions based on intelligence!
---
&gt; **Why give a character name if the game only uses the GAMERTAG!?** 
---
Because it was easier.
---
You literally just move to where you want it and set your new camp down.  It stores everything else and auto blueprints your current camp build.  You go to your stored tab and can place the temporary blueprint down or just ‚Äúscrap it‚Äù which just leaves everything in your stored section.  You will still have the extra things you haven‚Äôt unlocked that someone else placed down.  
---
We want the love.  But to make more of an effort on my part, I‚Äôll have a mic on more often while playing to help avoid confusion
---
If you move your camp it stores everything for you. However if you have some items snapped together like a house it sometimes stores together. I personally would recommend to STORE NOT SCRAP your camp items than you can be sure they travel. Just keep in mind the occasional bug can remove an item or two.
---
Yep! Wasn‚Äôt sure if that was you :)
---
The create a survival character.
---
How did you manage in other roleplaying games where you can't change skills on the fly?
---
Screw meta-gaming. Somewhere along the way, meta-gaming went from "pure cheese" to "purely acceptable" and I don't know when it happened. Somwhere it stopped being about "characters in worlds" and "godhood for everyone". And it's dull. You want to pen every chest and box? Then make a build that can. If you don't... then too bad, guess you can't open everything. If you want to be king shit with a hammer, then I guess you aren't also king shit with a rifle. 
---
Meta-gaming and meta-gamers are the basic bitches of the gaming world. I said it. I meant it.
---
Doesn't change the fact your just trolling and have interest in actually discussing anything, sad really, but hey, you do you 
---
good luck with that!
---
Thank you...  then I'm looking for the Charging Shotgun Barrel.  And I'll up my offer to 1000 caps
---
Yep that's me I'll resend
---
I hope they fix the legendary vendor bug in this patch otherwise how will you know what to buy lol
---
Theres a 25k limit?
---
and in my post title i said "SOME" never all, great job making nonsensical accusations based on your biases
---
Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean that I'm trolling
---
Yeah.. but every mmo has that "issue" with us identifying our chars in the game menu.. and still we see their names.
---
I don't know.. FO was supposed to be a little more "Death_DaYsY" free than.. PUBG or such.
---
I don't remember if they actually mentioned that when I created a char..
---
"choose your name: Remember that NO one will see your name. Your Bethesda Gamertag is how you will be seen by all other players" :p 
---
It's true, there's an arbitrage opportunity if someone wants to buy water at 2 caps and sell it for 4 or 5 caps to the robot vendors, but for the person selling at 2 caps, it's still beneficial since it's caps that don't count against their 1,400 daily vendor limit, right? 
---
Also likely all the pieces and perks to self Rez.
---
(Was thinking of doing a nuka mine build like this but with flying bats... dropped it.)
---
Take down your turrets and watch the budget drop like crazy!
---
It came with camo paint for PA, hunting rifle, pump action, and I think leather armor
---
If ur talking about woodland warriors that was a limited time PA paint
---
I believe, even just from the ingame Bethesda loading screen tips...
---
That mutations are what they are, but that Serums give stronger positives  with weaker negatives...
---
It moved me back to the Vincent's terminal portion. I sent the team request but you declined :/
---
i fart in your general direction.
---
I hate to agree, but I cant see any other reason.
---
They could make the gamertag show in social menu, if it was to allow for easier finding of friends and all..
---
Hell, a HUGE amount of ways to make it better than that.
---
Seems really lazy.
---
To me Atoms (and by extension the Atom Shop) aren‚Äôt real things in the Fallout universe. It would be better if it was with Caps.
---
Aside from the nukalamp, what other items are you thinking should be in-game?
---
Honestly, I'm a little surprised by the number of plans for outfits, skins, cosmetic items, and CAMP knick-knacks that are already available through gameplay.
---
Yeah I had the same thoughts.
---
We need new music badly. I don't care if we have to like donate to a patreon to get it, please keep adding new music. 
---
Sorry middle of an event, going to camp now, let‚Äôs try aagain
---
The sad thing is, I originally really liked the idea if crafting alcohol with special unique effects, and was very much looking forward to it, but the way it's getting shoved down our throats now  (no pun intended)  kinda ruined all the fun for me.
---
You should join my world since I have some troubles joining yours !
---
Hmm weird. I wonder why I can only apply it to one leg
---
Srsly man... grow up
---
I doubt there's a technical limit but there is probably an arbitrary limit impressed by Bethesda. If they just left everything in and kept adding to it ad infinitum people would get overwhelmed and never scroll far enough to see everything.
---
Ok
---
It doesn't work because Fallouts style of combat isn't suited to unrestricted PVP engagements 
---
Out of caps. Have to walk lol
---
This has all kinds of legal issues attached that will prevent it from happening, and really do you want a wasteland where people can play Rick Astley on repeat for a week?
---
Yet somehow life goes on.
---
Most servers have an empty WS about 1am eastern, from my experiences.  
---
Yep. Past that, the caps just disappear when you collect them.
---
Since you are using pistols, you can also throw Gun Runner into your perk list +10/20% run speed with a pistol equipped for added mobility.
---
At this point, I want Bethesda to pump out a game that incorporates ALL the suggestions on this forum... just to show the world what a giant chaotic shitshow it would be.
---
Fukn A. Well said. 
---
I like to put plans in the register at the Whitesprings crafting shop.
---
I can‚Äôt join a world... that‚Äôs just great.. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs taking too long, I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening.
---
Where is the terminal?
---
^
---
Definitely the best solution.
---
You can inly do so much with a few emotes, but more people than not are using mics and are really nice and approachable.
---
Yeah, I don't get why that was removed, it was a great mechanic. 
---
Pool Balls as well, most tables are covered in em (Fort Defiance and WS Club House are two that come to mind)
---
I'd always shoot their legs off and make them crawl after me. I loved messing with them that way.
---
Sunny top ski lanes
---
Same
---
Addictol can spawn in pretty much every chem spawn area. I have 10-15 on me at any given time.
---
I mean Bethesda could implement something similar to what From Soft did in their games where you could switch in the settings to show the characters name or the Gamer tag. But i don't really think that would be a top priority on their list of things to do.
---
Ah going there now
---
I‚Äôm gonna do my vendor run, let me know if you get on
---
if only. But you know what they say....War, War never changes.
---
This I agree. Sometimes in the entire WS area there are only a couple of Legendaries and half of them are level 42 not 62, it‚Äôs a waste of time even though they are easy to kill. 
---
What level do these rewards drop at? 
---
Don't expect to replicate your old camp in your new location and you won't be disappointed.  Although it stores your structure(s) for "easy" placement, it can be pretty hit or miss.  Even a simple 2x2 structure can often be impossible to place at a new CAMP site, assuming you've put any effort into building/decorating it.
---
I got the Can-do perk in a perk card pack and thought I‚Äôd try it out for a bit but I had to un-equip it and stop looking in the whitesprings bins and bear trash cans because it all started getting out of hand lol, seemed wasteful not to take them but 1 person just can‚Äôt eat all that imitation seafood, rice &amp; beans and drink all that canned coffee, i guess if we ever get dog companions you could have a ‚Äòbring your pet‚Äô restaurant to help get through all the dog food lol
---
I believe the wendigo cave is the second part of this
---
Okay that‚Äôs a good idea !
---
LOL. Exactly. 
---
Putting it in the title is getting 0 extra attention at this point.
---
Yes think so
---
Works on computer (which is no more useful to you than what you wrote is to me).
---
My point was, since it's not everyone, it's not really a FO76 issue (probably anyway, there are exceptions).  There are a *lot* of things you can do to fix it or figure out what the problem is, and I was just pointing out a few of the simplest ones.
---
Not everyone knows what to look for, and even fewer bother to try and just blame the game.  If you want a solution, start digging in.
---
OP is a prime example of that, he's dug into the crash log and posted it so maybe someone will recognize something.  I'm sure he googled some of that (which can be helpful, sometimes).  I can guess from a quick look at his post that he probably has a graphics issue, with the system unable to render a specific (likely scaled, if that matters) object.  Possibly a small texture, but that's really more detail than is needed.  Either his graphic drivers aren't handling something correctly, and/or one of the textures is corrupted.  If it's a texture, it could have been a bad download, or it could have been changed afterwards somehow.
---
In your case, from what you've posted...it don't work.  Hope that helped!
---
They should show both with the character's name standing out more 
---
The reward is the experience gained.
---
Wait actually no, not even literal experience points are good enough.
---
right, says the guy who makes up pretend arguments with no basis in reality
---
you really are making yourself look bad, you should stop
---
you know what, life is too short, the floods in the midwest destroyed my house so its not worth it for me to get worked up over some random asshole on the internet
---
next time you start shit like this with someone, maybe remember you are not the center of the universe,and you being a trash person makes you pathetic.
---
blocked! so I wont have to read your pointless and inevitable "comeback"
---
That's normal. I've never had her fly off after the timer ran out. Always just failed the event and killed her anyway.
---
Caps do nothing for Bethesda and people could just spam him all day long if it is an in game item that is so easily earned. 
---
Also it would probably be abused to send the Insult Bot after people who lost in pvp with their own caps 
---
In my opinion Atoms would both help fund development of the game and limit the amount of times people would be willing to send him out in a more organic fashion than you would see with caps.
---
Old gamer moment  ;)
---
*Monty Python's Holy Grail*
---
*'Tis but a scratch!*
---
Would store anything on the ground, purifiers and crops, sometimes you will lose these. Depending on your house build, it very likely will not place, so you going to have to break apart the blueprint. If you built a nice house it will auto blueprint so don't worry about taking it apart, when you break the blue print it will put all the items from the blueprint in your stored tab. Don't expect it to place unless you get lucky. I know when Bethesda forces me to move, I lose everything not on a foundation.
---
If it helps, you can work on progress on any character.
---
I just don't want to lose thousands of caps on my main that I've been collecting since launch 
---
Yesss please
---
Cannabis Commonwealth was one of my favorite FO4 mods. I became the most prolific weed dealer Boston has ever seen and everything was very chill. Sheffield was director of the grow operation with Professor Goodfeels as his right hand robot.
---
I really hope they remove mutations from survival or at least limit them to one per person. It seems unbalanced for 1v 2 or more engagements.
---
I sell everything I don't need for free or near to free.
---
Indont value the points, it's just like how are people offended by that comment? What a bunch of babys.
---
It happens when you're moving.
---
I basically just want to make sure everything comes with me (stuff I haven't unlocked to build myself).  That's about it.
---
That‚Äôs awesome üëç 
---
I love how Borderlands is rubbing into everyones face though how their launch is going to do shoot and loots right from launch the first time, though.
---
Well, if you think Anti Armor Tire Iron is worth more than 100 cap, buy it from me and flip it :D And I'll gladly sell my exterminator cavalry leg armor for 200 caps :D These things arent worth a sh#t. They are easier to get that it is to get rid of them.
---
What's wrong with unlearnt..  It is Appalachia after all..
---
This game absolutely needs a menu with a list of all currently active events, inactive event's with a timer that shpws how much time left till they pop up and an ability to tag desired events so you are notified when they become available.
---
Palace of the winding path is the next stop of the password. I hate this game doesnt have a chat feature
---
Yeah annoying, sell me something for 59 caps so you can fast travel
---
Well you have a very different answer to the others.  Hmmm...if I store something that I have not unlocked yet (like a large purifier), does that mean it will always be in my inventory?  I really do not want to lose the stuff this player added to my camp...
---
Sadly, you're right.  But, semi-auto is probably better than automatics for PVP.  Think of a bloodied explosive handmade with a suppressor + Mister Sandman, Covert Operative, Nerd Rage,  Adrenal Reaction + Strange in Numbers, Better Criticals, Bloody Mess, Demo Expert, of course... you get the idea. The DPS is absolutely bonkers.
---
Before the big TSE nerfs, I spent weeks trying to re-spec toward shotguns from semi-auto rifles.  It was fun while it lasted, but I regret every minute of it and I'm almost done switching back. 
---
I would at least try to trade up the TSE for a bloodied explosive shotgun.  Make sure all of your shotguns are modded for max hip-fire accuracy to make them better in VATS.  Cheers
---
I'm being downvoted because everyone assumes everyone is a duper on the internet. Completely absurd logic this community has I gotta day. "Oh my gosh, you have something really good?! You're a cheater and a duper and you are ruining the game!!!" 
---
You know, because its impossible to get good drops in this game on your own and all good gear comes from a magical duping factory...
---
Didn‚Äôt even think about that.
---
True.
---
I really wish we could post a bulletin board in our camps to leave messages to each other on this fashion too
---
Done. Offered buff out unless your particular about what the item is 
---
True; when I set it at 2 it was because i had quite a large amount haha
---
I‚Äôm in a world ! Hurray !!!
---
&gt; "Oh hey man, nice gun. Wanna team up an go quest?"
---
Not sure how you understood that out of my post.
---
Hooray!
---
Stupid, sexy, codsworth! Hah.. I too miss my bot.
---
Unfortuntately, while I have a Charging Shotgun, I don't have the plan myself (or the game on PS4).  You can occasionally find the mod at the BoS Vendor in Watoga.
---
&gt;nothing is wrong with a game being silly
---
I agree. But this is not silly, it's ridiculous.
---
Not a random spawn. Head north from abbies bunker, you'll eventually find a pond with a crashed vertibird in the middle. This is where I go to aquire pets.
---
Makes me glad to play on PS4 
---
Nah, they would drop 1* hunters wooden board.
---
Hmmm, can only see the tech data I requested
---
Some people just don't care about junks. Or maybe his game crashed right after he died. Happens to all of us 
---
Did you ever get your top hat?
---
Flatwoods gym. Server hop if nothing there. Some workbenches nearby to scrap the weights.
---
Most expensive bullet I ever bought :)
---
I absolutely want to be able to drop a bunker door in camp that loads into an instanced space below ground that I can build in. Basically our own little nuke proof mini vault.
---
This too omg
---
I could be wrong on this, but I don't think her total HP actually changes.  It's the amount of defense / damage reduction she has that gets buffed.
---
Beautiful build!!
---
That's silly. Deathclaws have been easy since lvl 30. People need to calm down with the hatred of any good gear. If you aren't using garbage then you must be a cheater seems to be the vibe on this sub.
---
Worth a test to try going between first and third person. I have noticed movement speed with speed demon seems faster in third. 
---
Exactly!
---
I read both of your posts Mr. Endgame.  They both said the same thing and were insulting to boot. There could be multiple reasons other players cannot just go farm somewhere else that has nothing to do with creativity.  OP was just voicing his complaint on a subject that literally hundreds of others have made right here in this sub.  Turret farmers are selfish and annoying and lazy, so why don't you get up on your pedestal and tell them just how creative they have to be to set turrets down in a spot that cancels out xp and prizes for others.  Who cares if there are better spots to farm.  That's not the issue here. Whitesprings is still a good run even with the Clubhouse nerf.  Stop judging other people and telling them how to play when you know nothing about their situation or level or what weapons and armor they might have.  Besides all that, how do you know what the devs. will or will not do.  Do you work for Bethesda or their subs?  I doubt it.  
---
Power armors used to swing much faster when in 3rd person mode back in fallout 4. Maybe you should check it out
---
I literally see maybe one every other day at the most.
---
Do enemies scale now? This is insane
---
I really appreciate the advice :)
---
Well, this mod for FO4 would work well for that:   [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/34739](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/34739) 
---
If it was ‚Äúthe other day‚Äù then they are probably gone even if the server didn‚Äôt crash. 
---
I‚Äôm stuck in a loading screen, I‚Äôm getting mad. Worst moment
---
Wow....sorry for just wanting to experience all the shit the game had to offer. And perk loadouts would help me do that. Its fucking fallout let me just casually play it and enjoy the world presented to me. I wanna jus be able to experience what each card or build can do. I wanna play on just one character. Keep leveling him up to make different builds. Is that a fucking crime?? 
---
I dont understand why ur trying to hardcore a game like fallout. I play other shooters for that. To say it's bad for me to metagame in fallout is an elitist attitude that shouldn't belong in a game like this. To say ur such a great role player by spec-ing correctly along the way tells me ur trying to mmo in fallout like it's one of the other hardcore mmos. This is fucking fallout dude.....
---
Elitist in fallout are jus bitches. I said it. I meant it.
---
Yes, sorry that‚Äôs probably my fault. If you go into areas first it should be ok
---
Those are in the minority by far in my experiences.  The market 76 discord has a lot of awesome people who will sell/buy for caps
---
In fo3 even with all of the appropriate perks and points a missile launcher or minigun would take a pretty long time to kill one. In fo76 it takes maybe 6 to 10 seconds to kill them. Plus in fo3 if you got hit even I'm PA it was serious while in fo76 you can just stand there and take it while beating them to death with a wooden  board. There is definitely a huge difference other than them not traveling in packs. 
---
Why use aimbots, no spread or recoil stuff when you can just use VATS? It's all of that combined...
---
damn just @ me SageAZ lol
---
Check your paintjobs for the t51 if you have any...
---
I do it everyday,  and it gives me caps and experience. 
---
Well, then ask them to put in the contents similar to this FO4 mod:   [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/34739](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/34739) 
---
No luck today ey?
---
Just use refined .50 receiver it's the highest
---
Rose's radio station glitch's out on me, have the time I can't get it even next to top of the world and she never plays music and then stops
---
You can?
---
I've definitely had armless ghouls chasing me and legless ghouls crawling on the ground
---
No worries lol. 
---
Hoping that floor tile is part of the Vault set next week!
---
I swear it‚Äôs my worst day on this game connection wise !
---
Oh yes
---
Same here. The mode totally falls flat because of the way the top three players are put on the map.  It doesn't even make sense
---
Not really. As some else pointed out here all you have to do is walk backwards and to the left and they will never hit you. Just keep walking back and shooting them with literally anything and you will when.
---
My point is... when the hell did this become a "hardcore" opinion?
---
It's not elitist...and since when has a Fallout game allowed respec'ing skills?
---
You do you, man. 
---
Are you talking about fnv? Because fo76 still is a stinking pile 
---
Easy way to track it, yes? "Learn pipe pistol mods -  X/43" or whatever. Plus, atoms!
---
Amazing, what do you use to fight her? This is the first time it happened to me, and she wasn‚Äôt crippled or anything, just kept flying around and attacking after the event was over. All other times if we couldn‚Äôt kill her she flew pass the no-go fence and disappeared. 
---
I'll admit, I was really hoping it would be cooler.  Or bigger.  You know how there's that one door that kinda leads into the hillside....but doesn't open?  I want that to be something...some location (maybe they will later??)
---
Both
---
Yes, it counts for both. Supposed to anyhow.
---
I have to log for work, we can try in the am if you haven‚Äôt found someone else by then.
---
War....War never changes
---
Not saying that they think you're cheating, just that your gear makes your encounters easier than theirs. Trust me, everyone would LOVE to have a set like you, but we can't. So for those couple of people that don't have trouble with them due to gear saying they should be stronger upsets them. Plus, if ya can't kill the bastards before they hit you, then they hit like a truck, so they still are shitty to deal with nonetheless. My personal belief is that enemies should continuously scale with the player in level, like in Fallout 4, where some creatures could always prove to be a challenge, so players of any level could have an appropriately tough fight.
---
Here's the thing tho, Jet is Only slo mo in fallout 4, Jet is supposed to be a post war drug that gives you more action points, what is in fallout 4 is literally Turbo with Jet's storyline mashed up, it makes no sense in it
---
I died in the fight once and then locked up for 5 minutes and then the server disconnected me. Probably something like that happened to the dead person.
---
I hope
---
Wonder if the player dropped the bag before the SBQ was killed, adn decided it wasnt worth recovering?
---
  I gave up on a loot bag last night at Atlas. 
---
I had killed everything else, L60 sentry bot, multiple L52 Col Gutsys, several L3x Mr Gutsys....lots of L35 robobrains...
---
 but the disappearing Assaultron was kicking my butt all over the place - had gotten her near death a couple times before she got me...
---
I wanted to keep trying b/c I knew everything would respawn if I logged off....
---
  But I had already burned wayy too much ammo, and it was well past when I should have gone to bed...alarm goes off too early.
---
I abandoned the bag.  
---
Sure ! Sorry about that
---
That‚Äôs interesting, some says her HP scales with the number of participants therefore a lot of new players can make her impossible to kill. 
---
The healing effect is pretty small even with a crit build pumping out crits but it's a nice gun to pick up if you don't have anything better.
---
They turned up the brightness at night cause people complained it was too dark.  Now those of us who are left are asking them to put it back (I'll admit that I dont care all THAT much...but I must admit having been out at night in areas where there isn't a lot of light pollution....it gets really REALLY dark when there's either clouds or no moon.  None of this soft glow stuff....  
---
That being said...yea. Make camp lights at night mean something again :-)
---
Bethesda please please let us display our freaking character name and not the account. This totally hurts Roleplayers in the worst way in a game you want to be about roleplaying
---
I had an issue the other day outside Whitesprings l, where I got mauled by an albino Yau Guai while dealing to 2 glowing Yau Guai. My map showed a death bag point, my compass showed a marker, but no marker in game. Took a few minutes of back and forth to actually find it. Possibly some poor punter had this happen to them too?
---
Related thought Nuking Venture and triggering Line in the Sand or Watoga and Mayor for the Day
---
I think the one in Camp Venture needs to be added to this list.
---
Right behind you when you turn in the technical data, above the cabinet is a stealth boy spawn.
---
Thanks so much for compiling this list! You are awesome!
---
Dude. Even at lvl 10 I was killing deathclaws with no problem. All you need to do is walk back and to the left and their bad AI will miss you everytime which some else already pointed out here. With no good gear at all you can kill them so my ability to kill them in 2 to 3 shots is irrelevant to the conversation.
---
It would probably help Bethesda too
---
Id like to see an under ground built, like a bunker style/prepper vault of some sort.
---
I didn't even know this was a thing, and now that I know, I'm on a quest to be insulted.
---
I just wanna know where the heck the radio IS.  I have YET to find the station (I dont think its inside the map area)....has a surprisingly powerful transmitter though...
---
Use a mic?
---
Why do you ask, IlikeToFuckGoats69?
---
VATS uses a lot of Fusion power in Power Armor.
---
What exactly is the point of a post like this?
---
Ok now were off to wendigo cave 
---
I would love to be able to dispatch the messenger bot
---
Need a couple of guys slinging chems standing outside and sell plans (if only you could sell holotapes) next door
---
And only up where modus is in the military wing/armory. So you have to go up to where it lets you track key card cargo bots and you learn about launching nukes.
---
Ok I have a decon shower in my camp if you want to get rid of that rad
---
Thats why I note where it is when I see a bag, so if I see them searching I can point them to it.
---
I only know of 4 in this area. Can you see on the list which one is not on the list and direct me to that one if you can. I have pictures as well so you can see were they are sitting.
---
Only for certain items though.  Things that we tend to need LOTS of...like Boiled Water or Ammo.
---
Adamantium skeleton will reduce staggers. When a limb is crippled you're also staggered and removing that possibility helps but you'll still be susceptible to straight stagger chance.
---
Enclave bunker- and only up where modus is in the military wing/armory. So you have to go up to where it lets you track key card cargo bots and you learn about launching nukes.
---
It‚Äôs no problem, if I didn‚Äôt have a carpool I would push a bit longer, but they‚Äôll roll without me lol
---
Good god man. Vault = storage. The purpose of storing something is use it later at some point. If they were going to straight up remove items from the store, they would have just said that up front.
---
Hell, there are some community manager comments that probably confirmed that they are simply being taken out of the store and being reintroduced at a later date. 
---
No need to be that horribly pessimistic. Jesus.
---
You said it, man.
---
Oh no, don‚Äôt take any risk for me !
---
Yup same issue
---
If they removed mutations and legendary effects it would be way more solid gameplay than it is now for sure
---
And there lies the true benefit of selling low ticket items for me. Sure, the TSE stuff could sell for a lot, but how often? Whereas you can maybe sell chems, water and non-spoilable food for a little bit and end up making more caps per day which will give you the money to buy those high-ticket items for yourself. I end up dropping stuff and bulking junk because of space. I vendered a bunch of Ballistic Fiber yesterday because I have much more than I need, but there are lower level people that will buy that shit up. I have no idea how much stuff I will actually sell, but even 100 caps a day will be worth it since you would be getting an extra day's worth of caps every two weeks.
---
you could also have home recorded DJ stations out there in the wastes.  Although, you'd want to include that ESRP Unrated warning.  Not that they dont have one anyway with all the open mics out there....
---
I was hoping for more lore, too. What brought the station down? Was there a coup on board the ship? Did something go wrong? Was it just lack of supplies coming up from earth that doomed the crew? I wanted more notes, audio logs, things to immerse me in this majestic beast.
---
There was nothing. =/
---
If you wait until level 50 to do the quests the rewards like armor and weapons you get will be level 50.
---
Are you still trying to get the under armor? I have no problem making it if you want.
---
Nice
---
Lower health and while standing stilll take a lot less damage with sentinel is amazing and I‚Äôve gotten a lot of guaranteed 3stars in pvp beta at west tek might be a good place to farm that armor?
---
There's no landing damage with or without vents, tested across all power armor types.  It's a bug, reported back in November at least if not during beta, but they haven't said a word about fixing it.
---
Well, if that's the case, then how do you suppose they buff them, then? If they can't even hit you due to shitty AI, then buffs to health and damage would be close to pointless. Should they completely redo the AI for just deathclaws? Many other enemies in this game also have shitty AI, so the Deathclaw sure as hell ain't the exception.
---
Best bet is to store everything to be certain. Especially if anything sits on the ground, it has a habit of leaving those out of the blueprint.
---
I want to find out if it has actually been said that you set the price obviously
---
Remember all those times everyone was all 'PC Master Race' in like every game ever? We might not be able to run a game in 8k at 2 million FPS but at least console players don't have to deal with this often.
---
Yep, no mods, and freshly game created INIs.  I've edited the OP to include that yeah, it's a fresh install with fresh INIs.
---
Platform? If pc, I've got tons of stuff I'm selling.
---
Unfortunately it was only available for a day or two about 2 weeks ago. :(
---
if you store it, yes. it will be in the stored section.
---
Many people make a single foundation build and put everything in the upper portion. Tons more luck with those transporting properly.
---
I'd rather have fo76 without mods if it means doing away with cheaters. Every bethesda game doesnt need mod support.
---
Bumping up cap limits is only a temporary fix. Just like stash space. Once everyone gets to a certain point, the value of the currency will be near nonexistent. The only way that I know of that would restore value to currency is to make certain things available by vendors that are only available by using caps. I have 75k but no use for it because I already have to much junk and there‚Äôs nothing to buy with them, unless I run out of a certain type of junk, fast traveling, taking a workshop or find someone sold something good on a vendor and I could buy to resale. 
---
We will probably find out tomorrow. Chillax
---
Are you on PC? I'd be happy to help make or modify your weapon for you. I don't have everything but I have a bunch.
---
Fo4 had a perfectly fine system where anything greyed out had an explanation.  Missing perk, missing mats, whatever the reason it was there.
---
No need for mystery mods when the is a perfectly good system they can just crib and modify from fo4 
---
They'll go up, sure, but I highly doubt any of the common masks will "explode" in price
---
Design for consoles, port to PC. Common problem.
---
It would make it easier for scammers if they could easily change names/identities. 
---
But it will be interesting to see how the legendary vender changes this. Depending on how lucrative it is to trade things in for tokens, it could raise or lower thier market value. 
---
I don't think it's worked correctly ever. I think it was the first mod parts I put on armor, expecting to at least be able to stun or get them to recoil back when I hit the ground, only to wonder if I'd done something wrong. 
---
I died 30 times yesterday and neglected to pick up any bags until it was over. 
---
"Repaired" and downloaded multiple times.  I am set to ULTRA and max everything, and my system doesn't flinch at that, so could the issue be that I'm running at max settings, and that's when the bugs appear, regardless of what system?
---
If it's a texture thing, I guess turning the textures down a notch is worth a try.
---
BUT if that fixes it, that suggests there's an issue with the game, not my system.
---
Yeah I really hope Bethesda put prices themselves like 1 star is 200 2 star 600 and a 3 star like 1,500-2000 (maybe less)
---
UPDATE: MIRV is STILL broken, and STILL blows up in my face literally every time I fire it. It's become a joke among my friends at this point.
---
Yea, anything woulda been nice. Maybe we will get lucky and they'll add more in the future
---
It looks really nice. I really like your garage ! Very realistic and well thought. Great job !
---
Then why not ask that question instead of taking a jab at Bethesda and trying to stir up controversy?  
---
I will reverse the question to you.  What makes you think Bethesda will set the prices to default and nnot let us set our own prices?
---
I mean all everyone can go on is the road map and three sentences that say you can drop items at camp and price them as well as vending machines.  
---
Still broken T\_T
---
I use to blow their legs off and execute them point blank. 
---
Yes, I'd really like to have another shot at that floor. Red rocket sign too.
---
I go there, but the vendor computer thing never has any if the mods I'm looking for. I keep checking of course, but if heard they are quite rare
---
You mean 2-story houses?  Mine is a very small, basic thing -- just concerned I will lose pieces I cannot rebuild again.  So I guess the final answer is to break everything down. 
---
I haven't sold or thrown away a single one, I'll probably end up giving them away for cheap once player vending comes around. Not really worth the effort for me to schedule a meetup with people in game, and I don't like leaving things at train stations etc in the fear nobody will find it before it despawns
---
The AI in for was better and it's the same engine with ported assets so that would be an easy fix but also their health and damage is pretty low as well. I'm using bloodied stuff but still never get killed even though I'm at super low health.
---
Was just wondering if it was already known.
---
Good question
---
I think Phoenix in Watoga sells the plan for the weapon, not sure where you can get the mod.
---
You can. Get limb damage perks
---
This is a good question.  I worry that if it has its own inventory, people will use it as an extra stash by pricing everything 25000 caps 
---
I love innocent this sub is compared to maket subs. 1k being a limit? Holy shit, you have any BEs or Unyielding?
---
You still can
---
Just gotta play the market. Canned dog food. Canned dog food
---
Same with me, but with all players. Finally enough I stuck with the game until then and defended it. Haven‚Äôt played since he too all my junk. Am I gonna come back? Yea...
---
Can confirm, I am currently sitting above 75k caps, I could easily get up to 125k if I thought there was a point. If this update doesn't come with a cap limit increase it will be completely useless to me. Which will be unfortunate because I really like the idea of player vending.
---
One thing I did was create my own checklist in my Apple notes. I made the list from the master one someone else had posted, but made it simple with the check option. As I learned the mods I would check it off my list on my phone and after a certain point I knew when to stop scrapping. Here's the doc list for anyone wanting something simple. Not every single weapon is on there and I didn't make a list for armor because those are so sporadic with when a mod is learned.

---
IKR. But the thing is limbs DO come off of creatures if you have limb damage enducing perks
---
You cant hurt others when you are wanted until they hurt you.
---
It may very well be but I feel cheated by it. Bought it at full price. 24 hours later the price dropped to $35. Then I found out I had to pay $10/month to play it. No thanks. Put the game on offer up and barely got 1/3 of my money back. 
---
Where‚Äôs David again?
---
Because it will be way easier on the server to not have to constantly keep track of thousands of different prices.  Kind of like why we have stash limits
---
Each one would need it's own lookup table stored, when it would be quicker to code and read/write using a default value.
---
Is he the Protectron in the Super Duper Mart? I think that‚Äôs where I saw the plan at
---
Not that I know of. The assumption is it will behave similarly to the fermentor.
---
I know a guy who does quite a bit of datamining though, I'll ask him if he's seen anything.
---
It says something about a bbq shack but it doesnt have a marker
---
sr fluffy 
---
I suspect they‚Äôll be like the Fermenting machine. If you notice it has an ‚Äúitems to display‚Äù function. I bet this is how they will do it all including things like magazine racks and bobble head displays. 
---
Yeah but they‚Äôd have to have an entire department dedicated to checking and reviewing names. The game still works.
---
Big Fred. Travel to my camp
---
Ah
---
You need the clown hat on too
---
Where are you getting ant meat from? I never see them.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted for pointing out this obvious double edged sword. 
---
Have you seen the runways in West Virginia? They are all too short IRL
---
Yes, that is Phoenix.
---
I feel like Bethesda will let us set our own prices. When trading with other players, we can set our own prices.  Why wouldn't they allow us to set prices at our own vending machines?
---
Borderlands might be one of the most overrated games of all time IMO. 
---
Set you bar/camp in the middle of the map. Two people or more drink Nukashine, the one who jumps the farthest away wins.
---
I made a post about this with pictures
---
Okay. Thank you!
---
Yup. I actually went and found new clown suits just tonsee if there was something wrong with mine.
---
I usually farm plastic at the third floor of Top of the world, and top floor of Fort Defiance (if that helps)
---
I dump or sell (to bots) unyielding stuff a few times a week. Not sure what you mean by BE though.
---
I thought Sam Adams 76 was the unofficial beer of Fallout 76 till I read this post. Now I know its true name
---
Well, in 4, they also had those animations where they picked you up threw you around and shit, and you couldn't stop it from happening, so those were pretty nice. Honestly, I feel that if they (along with other enemies) leveled with you, and they re-introduced those animations with maybe a slight increase in health and damage, they'd be pretty good.
---
Also bloody mess in luck if you want 15% of enemies to literally fall to pieces when killed.
---
Keeping track of it all on the server.
---
Each one would need it's own stored lookup table, when it would be quicker to code and read/write using the current defaults vendors use
---
I would say extending it out a bit would help but leave the golf course area alone as I have seen some great looking setups near the pond/small river which seem pretty much out of the way of spawns but provide a nice place to regroup. 
---
Oof, BE is Bloodied Explosive, the most expensive 2* combo. You sell Unyielding to vendors??? Dude, wtf? Let me know if you find any Unyielding +1 STR Combat, I'll buy for several hundred caps.
---
I loved this game got it for Christmas and am now level 102. I made lots of friends along the way sadly having to put it down till 12th as of xbox enforcement.
---
From the boat, go straight north off the road and imediately down the small cliff, at the bottom there are some metal shelves kinda in the open. It's on these shelves.
---
This is the area with the cabins in a semi circle. Shelves are near the front left corner of the cabin with the kitchen in it.
---
As specific as I can get lol.
---
The chem Daddy-O does it temporarily, but permanently?  I'm not aware of any ways to do that other than to move SPECIAL points.  What are you trying to do?
---
It definitely feels like the hate the game is getting is just for clicks, I‚Äôm not a fan boy but I‚Äôm loving the game, closing in on 200hrs and before that the only reason I had a console was to play Fifa career mode üòÇ
---
So like fortnite
---
Yup, how do i view your stock? 
---
Also makes it easier to hack someone's acct. It wouldnt be fair if they used the toon names for all those hacker out there.
---
That would be cool to see.
---
I did this for my broke homie weve been having a blast together

---
Thank you. I tried to make it look like a worked in garage and was very excited when a toolbox was green when trying to place it in the shelves. Sadly it jumped up to the top shelf when placed down though. I'm really looking forward to when we get to decorate our CAMPs. 
---
What are benefits of a full set of weightless over one piece of chameleon?
---
It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt even read the roadmap smfh! Bethesda‚Äôs already addressed your whining about grinding and RNG and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre releasing the legendary vendor. I bet we hear you complaining about how hard it is to get enough legendaries to get the item you want in the future tho, you can‚Äôt always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you just might find... You get what you Need!
---
Agreed. I wish they would add some animated attacks to all the top tier enemies. Scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens, desthclaws, glowing gulpers, wendigos for sure and maybe some others. It would certainly keep things a little more interesting.
---
I don't believe from what I read that this will fix your issue, but it is possible (which would mean I read all that wrong).
---
It's a lot more complicated than that, it may be that a specific texture (or setting within the asset) is fine, but your graphics card drivers are not handling it well.  A lower setting could fix that too, though I'd be surprised.
---
Could be a lot of things, and unfortunately it's a *huge* slog to figure out...if I had more than 15 minutes until I left work, I'd write out my experience with a device driver bug on EQ2 when it was still in beta that took more than 3 months to figure out...
---
If I have a little time after I get home, I'll look though your post a bit and see if I can some up with anything.  But if it were me, I'd start with going through GPU driver reinstalls/downgrades to see if that helped, then nuking everything FO related (not just reinstall/repair) and start fresh.  If it's more complicated than that...it's really complicated &gt;.&lt;
---
Really? I could swear that I did earlier, maybe the other people had fired at me first. Seems kind of a stupid rule in survival. That means people can take their sweet time strolling up to you, buffing, lining up their shot, and taking you down with a bulled to the head... and you can do nothing about it?
---
Maybe when comparing the base deathclaws, yeah i'd say 76's is weaker, but you're generally not fighting those, you're fighting the Albino, Glowing, Scorched etc. Variations which are all level 50+ and definitely take a bit of elbow grease unless you're running a very meta powerful build.
---
True, 76's deathclaws have a major weakness, being unintelligent AI, the Fallout 3 deathclaws also have a major weakness, the Dart Gun. You shoot a deathclaw with that, it becomes a cake walk, and it's not too hard of a weapon to obtain. Plus if you're carrying Fawkes with you he melts mostly anything you face in 5-10 seconds or less, but it's up to you to decide whether or not he should be a factor. 
---
For unique identification I guess.
---
Ah cool, thanks, I haven;t seen those yet so I;ll keep an eye out.
---
Also worth considering are those of us that weren't playing yet when the items came and went the first time. I got the game for Christmas, but I still want the Blackbird paint.
---
Super grateful for all of that. Definitly 
---
Same here, but I camp in the Ash Heap so I get to hit 3-4 Breach and Clear events in an evening. 
---
Bro if you sell .308's at 1 cap for 8 , I'll gladly buy 16,000 of them from you ! I can never get enough 308's
---
I‚Äôve moved 9 times and only once was I not able to lay down my full structure in the new location.  The biggest concern is the lie of the land (flatness/steepness).  If your structure was built on a flat area then you‚Äôll have trouble placing it on a steep mountainside, and vice versa.  But when I have trouble I always enjoy starting over from scratch with all of my separated items in he stored tab.  Oh, and I never fooled with manually creating blueprints, seemed too confusing.  I just let the game automatically blueprint my main structure and any unattached minor structures.
---
The garage door can be opened from both sides if you wire a switch to the inside with a power pass through
---
I've had this issue for 4 days now with freshwater brew. I've tried everything everyone has said and nothing has worked. I guess I'm just stick with this question forever and can't get anymore from biv
---
Btw your camp..holy shit..I need all of that lol
---
Backwards and to the left? I'll try it sometime. If i'm fighting deathclaws I  mostly just use marsupial to jump to places the deathclaw can't reach me, that is if i can
---
People don't like hearing that they can't have it both ways. If nothing else redditors will downvote to Oblivion anything they don't want to hear but may be true.
---
We need this
---
I was running with a friend last night through Westek, me in power armor and him not, and it really hilighted the difference in speed for me.  From the start I have been running a power armor heavy weapons build (gatling weapons especially), and I added a lot of melee perks too since it just so cheap to run that way, but now I have to consider going to the other side as I gain more perks.  
---
Unyielding doesn't work for me, so I just offload it to bots or dump it at train stations if they're out of caps/I'm maxed on caps. It'll probably go in my vending machine once I have one. Anywhere but eating up my stash! 
---
I don't think I've ever gotten a bloodied explosive anything. But if I did in a weapon type I don't use, away it goes for 1k.
---
Move it behind the club entrance and add about 10 missle turrets. That seems to get folks excited.
---
Just kidding, your camp looks great!
---
Why is there a cap limit? I just hit the limit for the first time. It needs to be made more known somehow. I thought that was the transaction cap
---
Vats has a cost to it.
---
Found a firemans helmet on the responder protection bot (the random spawn one), maybe try there?
---
Not having "I assure you we're open!" somewhere seems like a huge missed opportunity.
---
oh sorry about that! I'll check my settings
---
Plant a foundation. Put a stair going up on it. Place a floor at the top. Build from there. You use upper floors instead of foundations at the second level. Can be as big as you want. I find a simple 4-square fits all I need for portability. 6-square if you add the fusion generator for unlimited power.
---
Sorry about that! I'll check my settings
---
You forgot the classic swinging hidden door.  Kind of like the Nuka Cola door but just a blank wall.  I would love one of those for my camp.
---
Well you did good ! I‚Äôm also excited about this upcoming new ability ! Keep us aware if you build anything new (or if you make big improvements on this mansion).
---
Yeah... That'll do it.  
---
Thanks!  
---
I usually don't disturb those. Of course I haven't been desperate for screws in awhile.
---
Lol it‚Äôs yours to use when you want
---
Did it have a mask on it? Or was it just the helmet? If it did have the mask did it work? If it does have the mask and it doesn't work it's same one as from Captain Kid. 
---
Either way I‚Äôm loving the effect. Hope they don‚Äôt fix that, or set it as an alternate option (on, flashing, twinkling, Nuka ).
---
Oh. Survival. Never mind.
---
I put a switch in a wall hidden pretty well:
---
https://youtu.be/Yqh13-DDNGU
---
Been visiting every chance I get..  Have never seen any Tesla Rifle Mod plans ever...  
---
Thanks for the info anyway 
---
Game crashed
---
I think it depends, but I think the answer is probably. A friend gave me the big red rocket from the atomic shop before they nerfed it. It was moved to my stored tab when I moved, I expected to lose it but was able to keep it. Might be the luck of the draw. I think for normal plans you don't own like say the Open Light, it might get removed, or a custom chair, you will see only the original chair.
---
Lol. Marsupial works for us endgamers too.
---
Put on Bloody Mess. They will explode into pieces 
---
I‚Äôm curious as well 
---
But how does that work if were not in a team?
---
Well... I started a new character mostly just to be able to build another CAMP without having to loose this one. She's lvl 49 now and have a bar near Morgantown...
---
Hmm not sure, does it not work when you‚Äôre friends?
---
Oh no! Ok I‚Äôm in the room where you do the next step, so join again
---
I have the plain helmet, but not the uniform 
---
Dude! Right? üòÇ
---
Boiling water 
---
I'd honestly sell them for 20c in your situation 
---
What does that give out? Not sure I've done that one yet haha
---
Omw
---
Just use sticker letters "prices negotiable msg: username"
---
&gt;If it‚Äôs not whitesprings it will happen somewhere else. Next thing you will see turret camps at west tek and general‚Äôs steakhouse or whatever popular spot.
---
Nope, because the no-build zone around them is far enough that the turrets can't hit the spawn.
---
Do you have the contractor perk?
---
-50% cost on all mats, maybe you already can build it :p
---
I too am very curious
---
I would agree, as long as they tell you what you lost. Otherwise, I could see myself going crazy wondering if I lost anything and what it might have been.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty great idea, I wish I had a decent leveled character to do the same. I stick with my great camps for a few weeks and then push myself to destroy them and turn them into even greater ones ! But I must say, I really don‚Äôt see how I could do better right now ;p. Perhaps I won‚Äôt build a camp ever again (seems very unlikely actually.. I love building too much). I‚Äôd be happy to see this bar near Morgantown.
---
May can try booze addiction but I swear it resets on death now.  That may only get you a -1 however but I‚Äôm not 100% sure since booze has varying effects.
---
It's a definitely a good game :) I enjoy it, wish I was better at building a camp though üòÇ
---
What do you think would be a good price to sell cores for?
---
Oh wow 150 each?  I've been bulking up on crafting various alcoholic drink and I feel some others may fetch a higher price, like Ballistic Bock (increase ballistic damage 15%), High Voltage Hefe (+15% energy weapon damage), Hoppy Hunter IPA (increase scope stability, weapon damage vs animals).  
---
Where have you been getting Ant Meat from?  The teapot?
---
Hmm, maybe it had something to do with that we were in an event zone? Can people not damage each other if both are "in an event" in survival? Maybe people with bounties can still be damaged in an event? Maybe he somehow opted out of the event and killed me so fast I didn't notice him turning red? Unlikely but possible.
---
I‚Äôm going the Walmart method. Sell low but do it with enough volume to make some money, I‚Äôm sitting on a lot of chems/ammo that I should be able to make some caps easily regularly 
---
Yup, was here the other day. There‚Äôs one small section that you can find the code for and loot for some space suits, and another that goes right into the ground that has an access pad with no current purpose.
---
Turrets have our name and icon attached to them, maybe I‚Äôll just do that
---
I liked it for a couple of weeks, but it got frustrating for me. I enjoyed the exploring, my first frantic Scorchbeast fight, leading some Super Mutants into some poor bastard's camp for help, etc. It was fun. 
---
The scrapping loop, enemy pop in, camp frustrations, they all added up and I quit playing. 
---
I know a lot has changed since January but the parts that bugged me are still there. Random mods learnt by scraping, that one I really don't like. Carrying weapons back to base to scrap, or any base, lot of pointless barrel mods you have to learn before you get a reciever. It's random but I don't know how many I have left to learn, etc. 
---
I'd like to see mods learnt via crafting, and drop scrapping. Use found weapons to field repair like FO3 and NV did. I would enjoy that change. Carry weight issues go away as you grab and repair, no carrying back to base. 
---
It can be a lot of fun, but some parts of the gameplay are just frustrating to me. 
---
Pretty sure it was the same way with ESO. Hoping they get around to giving us a toggle character/gamer tag like they have there at some point. 
---
lol, thanks bro
---
That‚Äôs amazing ! Original and funny !
---
That‚Äôs why we gotta stop pre ordering. Happened to me with battlefield V. Bought it full price and a week later it was on sale. 
---
Another example is I just got tricentennial edition on cdkeys for $17. Some people paid like 80 dollars for that! I almost feel bad lol.
---
I‚Äôll probably just do 50% of listed price. If that seems reasonable? I have no idea what‚Äôs rare or common
---
No:( but I found the plan for the clothes!
---
They also don't benefit from the "party boy/girl" perk
---
Yup, I have a character at 47 (1H melee and auto rifle), learned almost all of the mods.  Looking forward to the Black Diamond, Perfect Storm and Somerset Special at level 50 drops. 
---
Plan to put a short recon scope on the Somerset, along with other mods. See how that 50% armor pen works along with VATS.
---
Currenty stab everything with a serrated combat knife, Snow King with gladiator perks should be fun to see how a level 50 snow king with a level 50 character performs.
---
"SEBASTIAN! BUY CANNED DOG FOOD, DUMP ADHESIVE STOCK NOW!"
---
Joking aside, for the passive farmer, acid is where the money is, Hemlock Holes is going to be a prime location.
---
 5c per piece, 90 piece per hour, 2.5 hours farming you have a days worth of vendor caps.
---
 Do that for 27 years, you'll have enough caps to buy a serum recipe from the Enclave.
---
Oh my gosh yes
---
Just ignore the snapping.  Try to line up a foundation as close as you can to another foundation but higher... which would be the stage.  Snapping makes it difficult to get close, so an easier way to do this would be to place the ‚Äústage‚Äù foundation one block down from the normal floor, then attach the new foundation 
---
My fast travel location is nowhere near my module. I've been wishing there was a mat you could place to set a target location. Would be ok if the module worked that way but I don't recall that it has.
---
Where's the super like button ü§£üòÇüòÇ
---
I'm probably gonna sell chems, food, and decent legendaries that I don't want to use but know others will. Oh, and explosives. Cause ain't nothing better than explosives. Come look for my camp for all your Boom Boom needs!!
---
I'll try to be there
---
If you hit up Ranger District Office, go to Bootlegger‚Äôs Shack for another lvl 3 safe and bobble head spawn. 
---
Picked the lock on that safe for you
---
Yes please! I'm sick of scrapping guns and not learning anything only to figure out I have like 1 mod left to learn.
---
I believe it is a drop for completely events 
---
If you're on Xbox I've got a quad crossbow (quadruple ammo) with 50% limb damage if you're interested. It's only a level 25 though.
---
Who's Captain Kid???
---
ORE!!! All types (except ultracite) and loads of it lol. I get all the lead ore I ever need from that one event alone. You can farm acid at the workshop next to the water park at the top of the map (sorry, can't remeber the name right now). With those 2 taken care of I can make a couple thousand rounds of 5.56 a night with Super Duper and Ammo Smith perks.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, I‚Äôll buy plans
---
People need to be reminded that The Whitespring is located in The Forest.
---
It's very common to see people complain about "anklebiters", new people complaining about high levels killing them on the golf club, people complaining about the turrets and stealing "their mobs" or general drama revolving around it.
---
No one asks why there's such place with that enemy level and density and why there are no such other places elsewhere.
---
The protectron vendor next to the food store, he lives in the small shop and has the pirate voice. 
---
Very nice ! Looks great from the outside as well ! Good job !
---
I use it so I can spam 4 bolts at once and it's a cool legendary and that's why it's such a shame it has no mods
---
lol.
---
So if a barfight breaks out....do the Brahmin Chips hit the fan?
---
Only when  your online in the same world. All good I'll get a chance I'm sure sometime
---
I just hope we can bulk them. Looking forward to selling off my ammo
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what a guy did to me too, shot at the bag. Turned out to be 10 missiles and 20 cannonballs.
---
The gave me a thumbs up like he was doing me a favor. I didn‚Äôt want to be a dick but I just walked away, I didn‚Äôt want that garbage. 
---
Also I was level 39 and he was 28 so I dunno what he was doing. He just kept shooting the bag as I walked away like I should be thankful lol
---
Are they still working on it or did they abandon it? I bought it when it came out for full price and it would really piss me off if they abandoned it, because then that would mean I was ripped off and also Fallout 76 has so much potential. It just needs more polishing.  
---
We have two statements, one (that I linked) stating the item will be gone from the shop, and one (the one you pointed out) that states items will be gone from the shop, with the use of a word that might imply the possibility of return, or might be a cheeky reference that goes with the image and theme of the game, which might be why the made it a proper noun.
---
Coincidentally, I did not express pessimism, I stated my opinion on something I noticed, and expressing a preference (backed by a opinion on the possible financial benefit) of a preferred interpretation. Pessimism would read like "Bethesda is taking stuff away forever," not "Please consider this alternative to the action directly stated by your media post."
---
I quite hope that they bring these things back (I rather regret missing out on the Blackbird Paint), and am expressing that hope by a polite opinion. I quite hope you're right. I just felt like expressing my preference, that's all.
---
I think we need a gold standard. The gold scrap could work if it was worth like 5 caps per to the vendors in game. Make silver scrap worth like 2 caps per. That would effectively allow players to carry around twice (or five) times the currency on them. Then value items could be sold using the new market. This would make the gold and silver locations in the game highly profitable to own, just like in real life.
---
I'm sure there are better "economy" minds on this subreddit that  could probably come up with a better way.
---
I would also like to see items be traded without having to exchange caps.
---
Thanks- thought it might be that way.  Was hoping it would show up as a weapons craftable on the alts after it got unlocked.
---
I guess I'll ask the obvious question that everyone will ask, get it out of the way. Do you have mods installed. Maybe a visual mod on camp items would bug it out?
---
I wouldn't call it amazing just yet, it's a great game that's coming together with some patience and elbow grease. At this rate it will be amazing by the end of the year for sure.
---
Shouldn't have picked it up! Well, I have one for sale.
---
Yes. While I retain hope they won't go the route of permanently unavailable items to push sales, I felt like expressing my preference in that direction.
---
I play on XB1 &amp; PS4 with the same linked Bethesda account &amp; my atoms and purchases do not cross the platforms.
---
That is what I'm saying, realized after posting that it sounds like a claim instead of an idea.
---
Yes. You cannot hurt fellow event members but they can hurt you if you are wanted. Next time go into your pip boy, data, events, and the press X or square to reject the event and you can kill all of the event goers.
---
Thank you, Now i know.
---
Thank you all! Will add you and buddy up when I can! üòä
---
Trash legendaries will probably have value. Not much, but trading them to the vendor will be worth it
---
It's fine, I love the grind.
---
Once spent 11 hours picking flowers on Skyrim for alchemy stuff.
---
Tedium is my middle name,
---
Traveling ^tedium Chef.
---
Ok. Now I know. Thanks.
---
100x this
---
You‚Äôre welcome! The good news is that all your atom challenges on a new platform will be unlocked so you can do all of them to earn atoms.
---
Can you even carry over progress from 1 console to another?
---
Even if you have full power user, jet pack operation will suck cores like there's no tomorrow. Sprinting is bad, but jet pack is brutal. 
---
I‚Äôm going to do half, maybe a quarter of that price. Robot Vendors give me 10%, so I still come out ahead
---
Why would they have to check and review names? 
---
I chot the cheriff.  But I did not choot the deputy.
---
Glad I could help haha
---
I wouldn‚Äôt fast travel to a player Vending Machine, treat it like a random encounter
---
Exactly. Value of trash goes up because we can get legendary tokens. Value of super rare goes down because we can use tokens to create similar items.
---
I‚Äôve yet to test myself but does anybody know if the items marked in the fermentor count towards the overall stash?  I‚Äôd check it out myself but don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be on until tomorrow.
---
Next time you find him, and he doesn't have the right plans.... Have someone hold him there for you, don't touch his inventory, and log out and log back in. It will reroll his loot again for you. Keep doing that until you get the right plan!
---
A little gift. Gotta go now
---
stable flux?
---
You can try building a half wall, then building a flat roof on top of that wall. That should work. No easy way to make steps for it, perhaps the slanted walls and roof could make a ramp?
---
Awesome thanks! Let's run something sometime were on the same time
---
I would say, depending on the item, use your judgement and say, "Item actual value plus 5-75 percent" based on item rarity. Obviously not with ammo or common items, but if a plan worth 100 caps is sold for 200 in NPC vendors, people will buy it at 150 or so because  they're getting a bargain from the NPC vendors.
---
Bwhahahahaha. Unfortunately I can only upvote once, but you get mine. üòõüëç
---
Or maybe the laser grid-type door found in Riverside Manor 
---
Yes! Apparently some people whine about darkness so they keep things bright.
---
Easy solution... A menu option for dark nights. There is no reason that each player can't have their own lighting effects.
---
I would like to see heavy torrential rain and heavy thunderstorms with lightning strikes too.
---
I see them pretty regularly around the second row of buildings along the back road
---
Sounds good!
---
Why'd you have to pay 10 a month to play?
---
Pretty much.   
---
This isn't WOW. There's no auction house and no legendary vendors to buy from that demand 10K in gold for your next level of armor.   
---
After a certain point you don't really think about caps any more. 
---
time to put on my full sentinel armor
---
I have a question for anyone at Bethesda about survival mode, or maybe anyone can answer it. If I have no caps, very little aid, and no junk, I don't drop almost anything do I? I mean, nothing comes out of my stash does it? 
---
It could be a menu option so each player could choose what they prefer.
---
...so if I have a low AP weapon, does damage keep scaling with each shot - 4, 5, 6, 7, % etc?  do you know the scaling with rank 2 and 3? 
---
I don't defend fallout. Those who it toxic towards 76 won't play anyway and stuck in their own interests bubble and continue to hate for sake of belonging to "everyone else hate this, me too" group, and those who play must feel how nice it became. 
---
Only issues i have is disconnects and lack of quests. And now, when dlc with more quest coming, it's very enjoyable game.
---
Oh, didn't know that. Thanks for the info~
---
It forces you to get a playstation live account to play it. It's like 9.99 per month or something like that. Could be more.
---
I cheat in single player games. Ever play Lisa The Painful? It's a real bitch at some points. Had to fix the Russian roulette game so I quit permanently killing off my characters. You can't save and reload either because save points blow up after using them.
---
But yeah, definitely not in multi-player. But let's define cheating... Is it editing memory? What if I made an app that scanned your screen and reacted on what it saw, like debuff icons in a MMO? Is a mouse with a numpad on the side cheating? They'll have more hand freedom. Is better gaming rigs in high quality unfair?
---
Cheating is like hacking. Defend one vector and the attack changes. They'll get banwaved eventually, but a new hack will open up.

Make some friends on this reddit and play with them. Or you could go the costly route and buy a ps4

It‚Äôs called fertilizer something
---
Uhm.. Well yeah it's an online game, so isn't that obvious?
---
diseased bloatfly for char disease and daddy-o
---
Oh, ok, I've been looking right at it. Thank you!
---
I'm on PC, and nights look like a cloudy day. Maybe PS4 uses a different lighting system.
---
NEVER! NO! HOW DARE YOU!? I‚Äôll have you know I‚Äôm a proud owner of Blackbird Armor paint! And I‚Äôll be damned if I let my only sense of any self worth go down the drain! I mean what else am I supposed to do? My life is so devoid of any particularly interesting aspect that a digital item in a digital store is of  such importance to me and my self confidence that I‚Äôm willing to deprive everyone else of any chance of receiving said item!
---
Blasphemy I say! Blasphemy! 
---
Good day to YOU, Sir!
---
was not obvious to me. I knew it was an online game but I honestly had no idea I would have to pay extra for that privilege 
---
Nobody is going to sell anything good on them if we can't set the prices ourselves.  
---
no mods
---
I don't play on console, but doesn't every game that's online require a subscription on PS?
---
Quit thanking this company for making good on their work months later! God, they took $60-$200 from everyone who supported their game and did nothing for the first few months but continuously lie to/cheat customers, break the game more with terrible patches, nerf any decent aspects and give the game more grind. What DID they do in the meantime? Add more shit garbage to the Atom Shop at outrageous prices and expect us to eat it up like the cattle they think we are. Fuck Bethesda, they haven‚Äôt changed and have only gotten more greedy. Notice how much harder the daily ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù have gotten? They don‚Äôt even want to give you 10 cents in Atoms anymore. They‚Äôre a company that wants your money, not your friend. Expect better.
---
I do not know. This was the first ever online game I had bought. Will never do it again..
---
unless u start using ur buddy as a bank, i give him like 15k he lives broken most of the time so i have like 40k
---
I would hope so too
---
Sounds like the game needs one of those first boot up ‚Äúmove slider until white dot is barely visible‚Äù setting so we can play with the visibility that is intended. Otherwise we‚Äôre all playing with different brightness settings
---
Hmm yeah understandable :( sucks
---
Agreed. I've been over it for a week now. It's well and good to celebrate the shiny new thing, but when 90% of your dailies and weeklies are alcohol related, it just feels of the same 'haha my alcoholism is so funny (please save me)' products we've seen lobbed at the 20-40 age group for the last four years. Yes, we know. That mug? Might be wine. Your water bottle? There's a chance it's vodka. It's emblazoned right there across the front in giant letters. It's not alcoholism if you're laughing about it, right?
---
And I know I'll get downvoted to hell and called a spoilsport, but that trend needs to die, even in Fallout. It isn't funny. It's the social equivalent of "how do you do, fellow kids?" How do you not.
---
Does the console version require monthly fees? Maybe I will look into that if it doesn't
---
You uist get some caps when you do it.  Watch the bottom of your screen next time.  
---
TBF you can pick up 1 star Unyielding gear super cheap. If you wanna PvP, you're gonna need some Cavalier's or something as well on top of it, but a full set of 1 star Unyielding gear is more than good enough for a Bloodied build in PvE. 
---
I going 5-30 caps per beer or food item cuz im making a bar 
---
hmm im pretty good at memorizing inventories with most vendors..dont think i ever seen these..maybe graham has them
---
Well I know that the Xbox 360 had it, PS3 had it for free. I believe it was switched around for Xbox One and PS4. I think you have to pay to be able to play online for PS4. I play on PC so I don't know exactly how it works.
---
The duping is far worse imo.  You don't gain much from killing people but duping item/money ruins a game economy.
---
Theres a few that spawn in fighting the deathclaw at the power station north of Watoga.
---
Yeah, if I would've known I wouldn't have used my actual name. So now when people grief me I have to deal with them taunting me with my real name. I put in a name change request with Bethesda with no response.
---
Nope. The game saves when the server disconnects. The game does not save on game freezes or server crash. I bought a TS gatling gun at a vendor, then game crashed, so no one gets that gun. Except Todd Howard.
---
Yeah, PvP is stupid unless you've dropped over 50k on Assassin's + Cavalier's/Sentinel's. I want to upgrade my Unyielding BOS set to +1 STR.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be calling people the n-word on Xbox
---
Unfortunately it does not.
---
That's not very good, but oh well 
---
Good company! Thanks for giving us what we paid for months later!
---
for bigger reward for you head in survival. can't wait for that sweet 1000 caps i lose on every death
---
Yeah I do have it maxed out I almost forgot to use it yesterday when rebuilding my base :p I have only one crimson flux and zero violet flux and with the card equipped I think it said three of each are required, not entirely sure without double checking though.
---
The mod or the plan? If he has the either, it‚Äôs not worth it to me. I‚Äôve only seen him once and that was so long ago
---
No it‚Äôs not spawn right on it, but it‚Äôs associated with it. 
---
So like you place it and spawn in a spot off in the distance from where it is placed, and if that spot doesn‚Äôt work it packs it, according to this other user 
---
This is an important fact that nobody else has paid much attention to.
---
It‚Äôs because it only makes one. It would need to be at least 100% more to make more than one core 
---
The game still sucks, you‚Äôve just played it so much your brain tricked you into thinking you enjoy it 
---
I dislike the idea of no build zones.
---
I also dislike the idea of non destructible camps.
---
I dislike how much people bitch and moan about this being a problem. The freedom of the game allows for this happen and for people to create these annoying camps. That same freedom allows you to obliterate them.
---
I really hope Bethesda doesn't cave to the pressure of you Whitespring whiners.
---
Like I said its just a step in the right direction which is what im most excited for. The legendary vendor will also slow the rate of cap inflation too. I think being able to break down and reroll legendarys will help with the cap pricing on them. The survival mode also gives caps a little more value since you can lose a lot more caps and you'll probably spend more than you make in there.      
---
A cap increase will still be only temporary but maybe it will keep our interest long enough and pull more players in until they can implement a long term player market. 
---
I'll be your bank, I've never had more than 2-3k and I've been playing since the BETA. All I need is to hold 12k of your money so I can finally get those damn neon letters.
---
According to other subs, you may be short changing yourself.
---
Civil war era top hat plans can be sold for 2k easy.
---
because you lose x2 amount of caps of your level in survival. Lvl 300? rip 600 caps each death
---
I love FO, but you're wrong. Borderlands has earned it's place with its previous titles. 
---
I'm just annoyed at all the Beer Hat stuff. I have other hats I want to wear, but I am forced to wear that fucking Beer Hat for the past several weeks.
---
Better idea: in order to not keep rolling down the path of "ban this" "ban that" to a point where camps are even more strictly restricted then they already are, make it so turrets do not activate until the camp or the player is actually being targeted by an enemy. That way people are still free to just build their little camp there if they please and the people that are farming a location in the Forest (a biome intended to be for new players) won't have to deal with a little too eager of a turret. Much better plan. 
---
TLDR: less "ban this", more "solve this in such a way it hinders the most players the least". 
---
Wdym it doesn't work?
---
Also, if you ever find BE of the weapons I'm looking for in my posts, I'll glady pay you 1k for them. Holy shit, actually I'll be *any* for 1k. I'll love you forever.
---
Be sure to farm Leader of the pack for low level legendaries. Each pack's leader (3) drops one.
---
yeah, you don't have to create new character for survival, but punishment for high levels is so big you either create new char or don't play it
---
FO76 is my favourite 3d Fallout without question. 
---
There is a Vault in Fallout 4 populated entirely by clones named Gary.
---
Another question to ponder. Are you someone who‚Äôll move their camp somewhere prominent to get customers, keep their camp mobile, or keep their camp tucked away in a calm corner of the map on top of a resource node?
---
Well, it's a free-for-all-killest which is probably not what they were hoping for. I hunted down someone who was #2 in longest-lived. I figured out where they were headed, plotted my intercept course, found a choice hiding spot, and when they came into range just walking along down the road I shot them, with sneak damage, with my mutant's explosive dragon with three rifleman perk cards on. This killed them instantly but it was then that I realized they were level 9 (I was level 129 at the time) and they got on the mic and said "Loser!"
---
My favorite though, with my Jason Vorhees character, was when I broke down the door to someone's camp, came in, and slashed them to death.
---
This gives me an idea...
---
Makes you wonder......
---
Does anyone there even play the game? Of all the weapons in the game why would they use a broken weapon as a reward? Why would they do it twice?
---
The reason I was thinking it might resolve with a texture setting change was my knowledge of imaging, and my ignorance of how games handle textures.  I know that textures are usually a file a max size, that is then rendered at different smaller sizes depending on distance, so I was speculating that maybe smaller renderings of the trouble texture wouldn't error out...but that doesn't make much sense now that I write it out.
---
Someone below says it's in the UI...which kinda throws out my theory, since I'm skeptical that the UI would be affected much by texture settings.  Unless the UI includes the Pip-Boy and PA HUD?  I've seen some buzz about PA HUD crashes in the past, and the last couple crashes were in PA, or looking at the Pip-Boy.
---
Something I'm going to try: GeForce Experience recommends 4k render on my 1080 monitor.  I started off playing at 4k on my TV during the BETA, but on a 1080 Ti (now 2080 Ti).  I'm curious how this forced virtual 4k mode will go.
---
The crashes can happen any time--completely at random.  Often it's a hang that could last a couple second, but could go minutes.  Then it sometimes goes back to rolling just fine, or sometimes it'll CTD.  They do happen more often during Scorched Earth, but they can happen just walking along in an area with no other players and few NPCs.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Sucks more when you sell a BE handmade to the vendor when you just wasted all your caps on buying it from a player.
---
This would be a music video in the Fallout world! haha! Awesome! 
---
That was a question for me as well, it makes absolutely zero sense. 
---
The blueprint thing has gotten better for me. That or I'm just getting better at not making my camp hard to put down. I got sick of needing to rebuild so I made a barebones series of blueprints of my camp without wall decorations or hanging lights. That seemed to do the trick and now I just struggle with building on inclines.
---
Space helmet. Crashed space station.
---
I killed ghouls at Whitespring. Picked up 2 legendaries. Caught radworms. Used a disease cure. Said I was cured if radworms. I dropped a few items to make room for the legendaries.
---
Server disconnects.
---
I reconnect.
---
Legendaries are gone, the items I dropped are still gone, I still have radworms but my disease cure is gone also.
---
One should be a Super-Mutant, and the other a fast-talking Ghoul.  
---
"15 caps, little man, put that Nuka in my hand!"
---
Dang
---
Well, when you build it, pro-tip
---
Store it when you‚Äôre not there/using it
---
Prevents it being destroyed (obviously, lol)
---
"Build vending machines and flag items for sale. Simply set your prices and walk away to continue your adventures in Appalachia, ..."
---
It's this line that people are basing it on. I think this post is trying to stir up controversy, ha. *Set your prices* being the key phrase
---
I have the clean version of the space helmet. I was just wondering if there was anything rarer than that
---
Woof seems steep to me, but that‚Äôs just me. I would never pay more than what the vendors charge. I would rather just wait till I bump into the guy
---
I haven't seen anything fishy accept the other night. A player had an axe and it kept clicking in and out of his hand as if it was equipping and unequipped, it was making a clicking noise. When we were fighting mobs he wasn't swinging, just walking up to them and they would instantly die. It's like he was using some sort of machine gun attack hack for a melee weapon. 
---
Being that it's PC, cheating won't surprise me, I just hope it never gets as bad as GTA V. 
---
"Build vending machines and flag items for sale. Simply set your prices and walk away to continue your adventures in Appalachia"
---
This was in the original Inside the Vault, and seems to imply that you're able to set prices
---
Leave that cow alone.
---
Bug notes:
---
-The issue with sometimes missing the first shot in VATS and all subsequent shots until exiting and re-entering VATS is back, but doesn't show 0% when you enter anymore.
---
-Is the perma-danger sneak bug back? I feel like it is only very occasional, but still happening in inside named buildings.
---
-In Raleigh's bunker, picked up optional quest item while in a team. Marker reappeared and quest reverted to showing that part incomplete upon next login, but the item is no longer appearing on the table. Teammate had to re-complete picking up a heating core at a different location in the same quest on their next login. Not quest breaking, but annoying.
---
-Occasional flying molerats in Asylum. Sounds fun. Isn't.
---
These are just my experiences (PS4) and may not be major issues, but I wanted to let the devs know.
---
It's Todd's fault. I still like him though.  Curse you Todd. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even hit one. They saw me kill a ghoul and started killing me and kept spawn killing me until I lost all my screws to another player. 
---
I mean, if I get a legendary then sure great, but no, my plan is decent non-legendary starter armor and weapons for a minor leg up for everyone who walks by. Just shove the machine FULL of stuff I can craft that will make the first ten or so levels a little easier. 
---
Gear with decent scopes, heavy receivers, that sort of thing. 
---
Ouch.
---
The best would be the Mask of Mysteries, no per negatives
---
Supply and demand, if I see items disappearing like hot cakes I'll raise prices.
---
I currently don't really sell much to players due to the difficulty/time in finding buyers, I'm hoping the player vending makes this much easier. Does the Vending machine have to be on your CAMP property though? Because if so I'm at a pretty bad location to sell.
---
Personally I'd like to have a market network that everyone could access perhaps from terminals at Whitesprings, where all players can buy/sell items even across servers. And perhaps you could build a terminal that connects in via radio at your CAMP.
---
It takes an absolute miracle to change people's minds once the majority decides something is bad. My cousin who has never played a Fallout game or even cared about them went out of his way to point out how trash the game was despite me being excited for it. Granted he listened to my points and actually had a reasonable discussion with me once he brought it up, the fact that he followed the game just because people were shit talking it sums up a large population of people. 
---
Suggestion posts aren't bad. It's the fact that people are so fucking unoriginal with their wording when MAKING a suggestion post.
---
Literally all of them start with "Dear Bethesda". And whilst we're at it, can we ban the useless "THANK YOU BETHESDA" posts where you claim they saved you from depression or some shit thanks to this game? It's getting cringe worthy at this point.
---
I've found that the 50% reflect damage effect doesn't work very well. However, the Reactive Plates for Power Armor apparently works well.
---
I read somewhere that you have to use the clown suit that is sold in atom shop. Don't know if it's true because I myself don't want to buy it.
---
It's called the Veil of Secrets, but you're right that it's the best.
---
I had the same issue. I tried for 2 hours then finally gave up. The next day I logged in, my daily quest was different... 
---
Does it protect against airborne diseases? How do I get it?
---
If u have done major for the day go to watoga and sneak kill the robots. I was stuck too but this worked for me.
---
Made a video. Enjoy! (slightly different method, same result though).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8II_OTQsFIQ
---
I sneak killed dozens of the robots. Still no quest completion. 
---
...who only say ‚ÄúGary? Gary!  Gary. ‚Äú
---
Order of Mysteries story line, have to find a body of a young girl wearing a strange dress. There's several. Google the questline, probably one of the best
---
Well I crashed out 30/30 2 weeks ago so... I don‚Äôt believe that nor even feel like giving Bethesda another chance. That game is ruined for me because I‚Äôve crashed and frozen quite literally 2-300 times. Wasting countless hours and loot because of their greed for money. Why release it with any crashes what took so long if they were gonna release a broken( but willing to fix) game. Take a few more months and perfect it. Bethesda is a fail for me n I personally won‚Äôt buy another game they had part in because of this experience spanning 2-3 months
---
Oh bummer sorry
---
I wish that happened for me. I've been server hoping and logging in for 4 days and I have the same quest.
---
Gaarryyy....
---
Same for me
---
You available?
---
Ya I finished that quest line but I don‚Äôt remember getting a mask of mysteries 
---
Can I post this same thing next week?
---
The game got good, really good now and it‚Äôs just a blast.
---
Hey bud you dropped this /s
---
As someone pointed out, instanced plans won't show up for other people, so there is no reason NOT to take them even if you know them. Why? You can give them to noobs or find someone else and do a "plan swap". 1:1 trade for anything you or the other person doesn't have but is in your (known) category. :)
---
Does it protect against airborne diseases
---
Fallout 3, not 4 :)
---
They've got the mooves.
---
Yeah I plan to only place it when I'm in my base until the zero damage to camps is applied anyhow.
---
IM LOVIN IT
---
&gt; I'll buy for several ~~hundred~~ tens of thousands of caps.
---
FTFY
---
How‚Äôd you get your signs and letters? What‚Äôd ya pay for it 
---
Of topic, but was that you trying to give me an excavator at the vault 76 entrance? 
---
I grab every bit of acid I see! I use so much making gunpowder and smelting lead and iron ore, it's one of my most desired resources.
---
The only reason I can think of is people making their name something inappropriate.
---
But then again all you'd need is some kinda *crazy* filter when making names and I just dont see how it's possible to filter bad words or hateful words from the naming process.
---
Biv has been giving me duplicate recipes for the past 6 days now, recipes for tick blood tequila mixed drinks... but I cant even make tick blood tequila!
---
Nah, I saw a piece for 800. My full set of 2/3 star, just no +1 STR, was like 3k. Just gotta find the right deals. I'll pay this dude like 500 each since he's crazy cheap with his stuff. I'll resell everything of his, too.
---
Did you test it ? If you did give this man a gold medal lol 
---
This, otherwise we have a constantly inflating money supply chasing the same amount of goods.
---
I was not aware that weapon condition had anything to with damage? At least that's not how it works with guns and armor. 
---
Fair enough
---
I'm constantly struggling with the caps cap so I don't imagine I'll be selling anything except maybe some serums.
---
Ah yes. I forgot how logical cults are. 
---
Yup.
---
I am listening. 
---
I would go totally apeshit over a gorilla suit!
---
You should play that song with open mic üéô hahaha I would totally love stumbling in to this 
---
They are supposed to add private servers with mods "sometime" this year
---
Well, I just tested it.  I didn't actually lose any ammo.
---
I had 10393 0.45 ammo in my inventory.  0/999 on my lever action upon logging in.
---
I reloaded.  I had 10393 0.45 ammo in my inventory, 5/99 on my lever action
---
I logged out.  I logged back in.
---
I had 10393 0.45 ammo in my inventory, 0/999 on my lever action.
---
I reloaded, I had 10393 0.45 ammo in my inventory, 5/999 on my lever action.
---
No ammo was lost, just the status of the lever action being loaded is reset.  The ammo quantity in my actual inventory stayed at 10393 the whole time, regardless of what the 0/999 or 5/999 status of the lever action was.
---
Nope
---
There seem to be several different problems at work here to cause this bug. So, if any of these other solutions don‚Äôt seem to work for you, I‚Äôd first try switching servers. If that doesn‚Äôt work, log off your profile and turn off the game. And if that doesn‚Äôt work, try power cycling your console/pc. 
---
Power cycling worked for me after all else failed.
---
They plan to add this eventually, it's been known for a long time. It'll be a while yet before it's implemented, though.
---
Tomorrow ? Next week you mean 
---
I totally understand you,and I wasn't being ungrateful this post was more like inside joke between us fo76 player, other than that I honestly enjoy queen event
---
That's criminal. Lost items but saved the disease? Wow. Fyi though, the water fountains in the Whitespring gazebos cure diseases if you take a drink.
---
How do we tell all 24 Garys apart on the server? When you add Gary to friends, which gamertag is he on your friends list? 
---
Beyond that there is the much more tangible requirement by microsoft to display gamertags in game. (Maybe Sony as well, I just don't know)
---
Odd question. But...
---
Are you doing a melee sneak attack? That worked for me first try. I have seen other threads saying that they were unable to complete. 
---
Chameleon might be a factor as well. 
---
If you want to say atoms equal cash, so that 1000 atom item is $10, then you have to also admit that Bethesda will pay you $30-50 just for playing until you work through all the easy challenges, and then up to $5-10 a week after that for daily and weeklies.
---
Ya.  Or like the other day for me:
---
Got Wasted On for my daily.  While collecting ingredients, server crashed.
---
Join a new server, get "Taste Test" instead upon logging in.
---
Finish new quest (while simultaneously still having the learned recipe from Wasted On).  Get rewards.
---
12 hours later, at 6pm, before the 8pm reset, I log in and get a new "Wasted On" quest instantly upon log in.  No where near Biv.  Finish quest, get rewards.
---
2 Hours later, at 8pm, get new Taste Test from him for the new daily.
---
So occasionally he gives you both, but also the quest can bug out during server crashes and you can get them even if you already complete the new one.
---
This would be very helpful 
---
I don‚Äôt have a pic of it but l I launched a mirluek queen up with my TSE lever and the SBQ swooped in and launched it into oblivion before I could get the weapon. Big sad
---
Most online games on ps4 require the sub. However! If you buy the yearly its $60 (so $5 a month) or you can luck out once or twice a year and get it a on deal (recently $45 for a year). It does honestly blow but it has some upsides with some very solid games for "free" every now and then.
---
I got 3 ‚òÜ Exterminator's Mr. Handy already lol, but thanks for the offer 
---
That's fine. I am just pointing out an issue.
---
understood, thank you
---
Could, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't stack with Speed Demon. Might be useful if you didn't have the mutation though.
---
No, that was a different giant key.
---
Sometimes I do give bullets to other players... One round fired at a time...
---
If you connect two foundations and then move one it won't snap if you're trying to place it back down in the same tile, so you can raise or lower them with a lot of finesse. It gets a little fiddly trying to make sure it's lined up evenly, but once it's connected you can then snap to either elevation and extend your platforms very easily. [Here's an example](https://i.imgur.com/Kswuidm.png) I threw together using that technique.
---
That's actually pretty good, however I do have 2‚òÜ Assassin's Knucle and I don't know if I got it from this event or nt.
---
I hate this kind of annoying, perpetual quest. 
---
Every time I hear about this stuff it makes me glad I play any MP games on my console. My PC is for VR games :) (and games the PS or switch doesn't get).
---
It really is.  I've been super patient with Bethesda because I love fallout.  But this is *their own game's endgame*.  It's literally the climax, centerpiece of the game, and they can't figure out how to have it not crash the servers?  What in the fuck.
---
I climbed up on a hill by west tek, hid and sniped a mutant and it counted. 
---
Use super duper 
---
It's random your quest and rewards, so could be only as many as there are recipes... or it could be forever.
---
What weapon?
---
The same way they filter the tags now.  I've not seen any "Death_to_EthnicGroup" names for starters, and not a swear word to be found yet either.  Just put that filter to work on character names and let us report the ones that make it past. 
---
No more than 300 caps a core. I‚Äôd pay that much for them 
---
You can‚Äôt wear anything over mascot heads either. So make it the same script as those. 
---
And my response was more of an inside joke about the Brotherhood of steel haha.   I kill the queen regularly and I'm almost always underwhelmed by her loot. 
---
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. (With the exception of lead and aluminum).
---
You can try a simple before and after comparison on Watoga protectrons, shoot once without it, take a screen cap, drink up, shoot a different bot, screen cap and compare.
---
I may have to do this myself.
---
Prolly referencing the inside the vault if it comes out tomorrow. But your right the actual patch doesn‚Äôt drop till next week
---
Wonder how many recipes there are
---
In case you don't know, bug parts are good for acid. Anyplace that has super mutants, check the bags of meat. I usually farm steel at Wes Tek by collecting all of the super mutants weapons, and check all the meat bags and piles for bug parts. There's a bunch out front that are flattened on the ground in those cages and more inside. The laundry/maintenance area at Whitesprings has a decent amount of Abraxo, and some of the storage shacks around the course have fertilizer too.
---
Abraxo Cleaner = 1  
---
Bag of Fertilizer = 1  
---
Bag of Chlorine = 1  
---
Bloodbug Proboscis = 1  
---
Undamaged Abraxo Cleaner = 1  
---
Abraxo Cleaner Industrial Grade = 2  
---
Antifreeze Bottle = 2  
---
Bloatfly Gland = 2  
---
Coolant = 2  
---
Cracked Deathclaw Egg = 1  
---
Ichor Sac = 4  
---
Makeshift Battery = 3  
---
Pristine Deathclaw Egg = 1  
---
Suprathaw Antifreeze = 4
---
From what i have been able to tell they do count towards stash space. 
---
Naming the character was likely done for us to tell the difference between our different characters, whereas the choice to use the gamertag was done to allow other players to not conceal their identity (as showing character name could allow for abusive behavior provided they left the server before the victim was able to check the social menu etc).  There is also the issue of possible inappropriate character names being used etc too.  Personally I would like if the character name also showed, but I do feel the tag/player name should be present as well.
---
Xbox 
---
True story. Had to use the disease cure and a stimpack. Was at a lower level (20's) and needed to avoid further rad damage. Radworms increases rad damage by 50%.
---
Nah
---
It really really did to almost a dozen items total üò©
---
Crossbow does have a mod. Prime receiver.
---
Pip boy, data, select quest ,toggle on or off
---
What's so great about Cavaliers stuff in 76? In FO4 I think it gave about 15% damage reduction but in 76 it gives about +20 damage resistance. That's a huge difference and not all that great, right?
---
As long as cap drop rates don't change, I don't think that raising the cap limit will greatly cause inflation. 
---
I farm that event for jumpsuits.
---
I'll hand over all my low level gear if you want and we're on the same platform (PS4)
---
\[PLAYER TAG\] (\[CHARACTER NAME\]}
---
I don't mean to be the dissenting opinion, since I enjoy the game too, but they kind of had an obligation to continue working on this game since they said it would get support for "years", and the whole business model pretty much relies on them supporting the game.  It's only been a few months since release too.  
---
So, while I do like the game, and I look forward to new content, I'm not ready to give them pats on the back for doing what is expected of them.  I reserve that for when whatever they add is very good, since we're still in the process of ironing out most of the issues in this game.
---
That being said, I'm glad that the opinions of detractors on the internet are not the ones making the decisions, you know, those people saying that Bethesda should just cut and run because that would somehow be the better choice according to their twisted logic.
---
Good idea...because I just got a mod for a gun I thought I had every mod for and then I hit a mod for a gun I tight didn‚Äôt have mods 
---
No. Completionist scum, get out of my Fallout.
---
Ready whenever you are GT DrunkenGamer75 
---
oh hey this post again lol
---
but for real, this post at least once a day since release and they still haven't changed it?
---
Is there some secret trick to grinding caps? The difficulty of grinding caps should set the value. It seems caps are too easy to come by maybe.
---
I've tried melee, guns, with chameleon, without chameleon......
---
Correct. I was referencing the inside the vault which I would bet my house on being about player vending and item displays since last week was regarding shear terror 
---
I'd *definitely* try disabling 4k downscaling.  I saw that a bit ago and thought about it, but never looked into it.
---
I'm betting a lot that it's a graphics issue, the "Scaleform::Render::Matrix2x4" lines near the end point in that direction.  Unfortunately I didn't see anything that narrows it down at all.  It *could* be related to the 4k downsampling, or a rogue graphic element (yes, including the HUDs...or the menus, or the grass, or the sky...pretty much everything).
---
With the slowdown information included, it sounds a lit like your graphics are getting overloaded, especially if that sometimes leads to a CDT (I have experienced that on my 1080), which might indicate that your card isn't handling everything well - that's likely more of an optimization issue than a card power one though.  But again, that's not much help, it could also be your crashing when a player inventory loads with a certain item in it, or when someone has 9304803 pounds of crap on them, or the player name has a Z in it...any of which could be a FO issue or a driver issue, or a combination.
---
I'd still go down the routes outlined and see.  Changing up some of the graphics settings (literally any of them) might do the trick, without more to go on it's really a crap shoot.
---
It's still 15%, and it's 15% per piece. So a full set makes you basically immortal.
---
I don‚Äôt believe so, used and scrapped several of them throughout playing the game never come across a mod. Only skin I‚Äôm aware of is the Christmas Slay Bells for the death tambo
---
Ah, that's a good idea, so one can shoot from above and not be as vulnerable.  
---
It brings out bots in stages first 1,3,5. 
---
It‚Äôs bugged and reported 
---
That's about the only thing I haven't tried. I'll try this tonight. Thanks.
---
Thanks! :)  it's a work in progress but i'm getting there.
---
Have you been using the crossbow or have one in your stash ?
---
Same thing happened to me last week and the most reasonable sounding explaination I found was that its caused by something having been clipped through something else in your shop. A plant whose leaves clip through the wall, or a poster that's clipped into the wall. It allows you to place it the first time, but ends up being a conflict when trying to place the whole shop down a second time. The solution was to build just the empty structure, blueprint it, then decorate every time after you place it down. 
---
Yes Bethesda thank you for fixing your many mistakes and trying to make the game you promised at launch months later
---
The times when the bodies just fly are always the best. You get both my upvotes for the vid and post.
---
I wasn't clear, I have met many filthy casuals who I play with when they are online but would be good to play with my IRL friends. The nature of us filthy casuals is that we play at odd times and infrequently due to work etc. so the wider the pool the better. 
---
What about any legendaries you can scrap with the new legendary vendor for tokens to re-roll or improve your other legendary gear? I buy cheap ledge stuff all the time, 3 star rolling pins for 40 caps
---
It does work 
---
It matters with the chainsaw I know that much 
---
Oh man I was just in this spot last night scoping out a new camp location. I like what you did here. I definitely like this spot and plan on building there next time I log on.
---
How much per flux ?
---
It's required by Microsoft.
---
you really cant see any other reason?
---
Literally the first thing that came to mind was: a way of letting us tell the difference between our own characters.
---
They're both equally as easy.
---
Nope.
---
They added the keyword that blocks Super Duper - same one as bulk materials and Mistress of Mysteries 'regalia' - to the records.
---
Always starts with one. During a nuke earlier as 4&amp;5 came out it said one had died when I was certain now had then just said 5/5 after a min or two 
---
Unless they've since changed it since release, quite a few keys were hardlocked. Same issue in FO4 IIRC
---
Good. It should be tedious. I want it to be even more tedious. Bethesda should implement a cooldown for swapping perk loadouts.
---
I will be selling my spare plans way below vendor prices. I was thinking at or slightly below the price you'd get with max ch, grape(?) mentats, and rank 3 hard bargain. It'll probably end up being some percentage of what the displayed value is in your inventory
---
Farm legendaries to sell on the market places and kill people in pvp. I barely even bother with vendor runs anymore. You used to be able to server hop cap stash runs, but they fixed that.
---
If you are going to do vendor runs get an outfit plan that sells to vendors for decent caps: civil war, witch costume, skeleton costume, etc. Craft a bunch with super duper (they require minimal materials, some cloth and plastic) then run through the vendors. Easy caps with little effort. 1400 each day per character. Combine this with farming legendaries and you can easily get 2k+ a day doing nothing else.
---
From what Iv seen it‚Äôs glitched and can‚Äôt be gotten right now as I have done the quest every day and gotten all other recipes plus doubles of a lot I can say it isn‚Äôt in yet ... done it on 2 characters
---
Thanks. Last time I had all of them at once. 
---
No. It wasn't. It was designed so you could swap perks sometimes, not so that you can swap them all of the goddamn time to min-max your degenerate "meta build"
---
In my case it was the worst news of the week. At last I was enjoying "difficulty" in the survival mode and now with the double xp everything is simple again. I can not even enjoy leveling a new character.
---
I brought the game for 25 euro
---
https://livekaarten.nl/fallout-76-xbox-one it‚Äôs even cheaper now.
---
That's true.
---
All of them. Iron sights. Tactical sights. Long range scopes.
---
No, if the game is not on sale dont buy it. Yes there is fun to have but it is not worth full price even at its best.
---
Shop around especially physical copies and get it at a discount.
---
Yeah. I just ignored all of your bad faith horseshit rhetoric and cut to the meat of the issue and that offends the wannabe conmen like yourself.
---
Hm unknown
---
I'd be a little more excited if they doubled more than experience.  Double enemy loot, double experience, now that doubles my interest. 
---
I'd say yes, but seeing as it's spent most of its time on sale at below half that, it's hard to swallow the full price.   The game still has some annoying day-zero bugs and still blue-screens my PS4 every few hours of play.  But I've got hundreds of hours on FO76, even at full price I'd be looking at 20c/hour, so I really have no reason to complain.
---
But full price? hrmmm.    I just checked Amazon and it's $AU 29.   So I think you can do better than 70 euros.
---
Not sure if it is worth that much, but the game is fun. When you stop looking at the bad review hype train, the game can actually be very fun
---
Yea most of the time from my experience the first one comes out then about a minute and a half or less the next 2 come out then a minute later later the last 2 come out
---
I meant to throw a /s there at the end. I meant it sarcastically 
---
I am convinced that there is indeed a feedback loop. I have only found a couple anti-armor weapons in 200+ hours of playing. The only firearm was an AA missile launcher. I remember an AA pole hook and tire iron, probably one or two more melee weapons. At the very most, 5x AA weapons in 200+ hours
---
Yesterday, I found four of them on the same server...two of which were consecutive drops. AA gauss rifle, western revolver, combat rifle, and something else. 
---
If you're on pc check out cdkeys 
---
I saw a player with a name which was a set of numbers. Probably thought the game will have option to name the character but nooo√≤oooooo...
---
Never seen the dual bar. Do you have any pics?
---
You even get an additional action prompt when you hover aim on downed and alive enemies. It says R) Execute or E) Execute, not sure what the key is. A well fed friend told me.
---
I plan on primarily selling vintage booze, but insofar as prices go...I'm in no rush to get rid of them. If people want the stuff, they'll buy it at the price I list. 200 caps for a Vintage Nukashine will probably be my starting point.  
---
That aside, I wind up with far too many diluted healing items (100 of Rad-X, Stim, and Radaway in my STASH, in addition to whatever is on my person). Those will probably sell much cheaper, 25 caps per.
---
Id love a door similar to the Enclave's whitespring entrance. Just a wall and a hand scanner.
---
How much is reasonable to sell regular stimpacks for?
---
Fixed now, sent you a request
---
If you're paying full price for anything, well you're doing it wrong.
---
I'm all for letting people do their own thing. But that doesn't even fit the fallout aesthetic. :/
---
AND HIS NAME IS...
---
~~Ghaul~~
---
GARY! 
---
If you‚Äôve got nothing decent or constructive to bring to the conversation then why are you here? All I see is an arrogant arse bandit trying to gas light folks he doesn‚Äôt agree with.  
---
I see names all the time with numbers switched out for letters, letters that sound the same, and replacing it with so many things.
---
Keep doing line in the sand, I got lucky, randomly got it while looting Fort Defiance :)
---
Yes please !
---
I've gotta disco fever and the only prescriptions, more Brahmin bell. 
---
Tell it to delete blueprint, it does delete the blueprint, but STORES the components separately. Then rather than popping down a single unit, you basically have to build from the ground up. Pain in the ass, but at least you don't have to use your current materials in the rebuild.
---
And there are a ton of things you cant remind, like the build menu. Really frustrating. 
---
Added with the Pioneer Scouts quests maybe?
---
As someone who will be joining the game within the next 4-12 days(curse you shipping times!) This dounds really awesome.  So as a newbie, thanks!
---
Pew pew pew 
---
Are you looking at the Tricentenial version? 
---
Just buy the regular game, the tri version only adds skins and emotes, that you can get from the Atom shop.
---
Mine is giant and permanent.  It‚Äôs my endgame camp
---
I think it is. The gameplay is like any other new wave Fallout game. And zipping across the Commonwealth in my BOS vertibird from one battlefield objective to the next is what I remember most from FO4. After a few days I got over knowing I won't run into any NPCs to charm or con.
---
That being said, after paying more than I needed to to Redbox, I picked the game up on PS4 for $15. I'm certain you can find this for less than ‚Ç¨69.99 somewhere.
---
Thanks! Worked like a charm~
---
I picked a perk card but it didn‚Äôt level the special.
---
If that's the case no one will bother with it cause the vendors screw ya. The value of an item shows to be 150 year you get 20. 
---
My man. That's my plan as well. I have every weapon and mod recipe unlocked almost. Maxed out low level weapons and armor is where it's at.
---
I‚Äôd be all for it. Pistols are pretty weak right now and could use some kind of buff. Would be an opportunity for additional perk cards as well... dual wield at decreased accuracy, maybe some perks to offset that penalty
---
Dumping chems in the river doesn't sound very environmentally conscious! /s
---
Well if you need one made on ps4 send me a message 
---
interesting.  i'll keep checking it, as we've inconsistent results. again, i did only one use case, so it could be ammo type/ weapon dependent; or a variance between hud and inventory; or have something to do with over/under 1K.  was the end of my lunch break, so i didn't have time to be thorough. if it just empties your clip, it's an annoyance, but if it does cost ammo, it's fuckery.
---
I don't know what Bethesda was expecting. That people just wouldn't do it? That nobody would misbehave? Or did they just decide that it wasn't worth the effort of locking the engine down and adding anti cheat. 
---
Here's hoping they will fix it in the upcoming updates. 
---
Sad it doesn't work. So many times I super man into some sniper and only to get a Superman landing and a super death as they super vats my head off. Sucks to be a pa user sometimes
---
Up voted for truth.
---
I'd be Gary 13
---
Your camp's what?
---
I'm not far away either (just to the east of Sutton Station, about a minute's walk from New Gad and Summersville.) 
---
My understanding is all faction vendors will be connected to that 1400 pool. That means even if I don't live at Whitespring, I can just run up and over the hill and get my daily allowance. :)
---
The system that Guild Wars 2 uses for character names is fantastic. The names have to be unique(....so you can't have 50 Garys)
---
From everything I seen, the helmet with the gas mask is not an in game drop but was found by players while in the dev room.   The only marine helmet available in game is the marine tactical 
---
Sadly, I'm on PC. Thanks though!
---
Was worth a shot (No pun intended). Not sure what else may work. 
---
Nice that's good to know! I'm gonna hit that event next time I see it for sure
---
I was building fairly large camps but as I needed to be more mobile for resource gathering (gold, acid, etc) I simplified it down to a smaller building that I have been able to relocate. I may try an even smaller footprint and blueprint it and see if u can have a more elaborate one blueprinted at the same time. The changes they have been making definitely help.
---
The problem might be that you get addicted to alcohol, for some reason this stops the quest from triggering when you get the kill
---
Definitely. 
---
Thank you! Perhaps it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúbest‚Äù legendary effect, but definitely most entertaining. And the point of a video game is to have fun, right? :)
---
The important questions I haven't seen..
---
How much does the vending machine hold? If it has a 200lb limit.. That will change things. Is it shared with your stash?
---
Also, does the money inside it go straight towards the cap limit?
---
I've been role-playing as Gary since launch. Survival mode has made this so much better.
---
Would be nice if there was a Pip-boy interface (maybe another tab like "Communications" ) where it was a server chat you could opt into by "scanning for nearby survivors". Would be really nice if you could communicate in that way for long distance questions, etc. 
---
Yeah, it's not over-powered, but it's a bit of a leg up until they can get their shit together. 
---
Seeing Nick Valentine go flying arms and legs spread like a rag doll is priceless 
---
I think pvp was not a expected primary part of the game. I don't think Bethesda went into this thinking they would have a pvp server and thus even if their was cheating, it would not be a major issue.
---
Yeah I've been giving that a lot of thought recently. Not sure weather I should try and stock up or wait till its released. Also, should I be keeping 3 star handmades that aren't great to re roll them? 
---
I'm betting either during Nuclear Winter (Four Horsemen theme plus Nuclear Winter? Yes please!) or Wastelanders.
---
Weird we can't quick cast pa. Tho you can favorite a pa chest peice and that will show up on wheel. I cycle threw a few depending on the fight. Won't leave base without reactive plates on speed dial
---
Didnt know it showed up as a salute! Was wondering if that was a tricentenial edition exclusive heck yeah AD VICTORIAM!
---
Agreed! Personally, one of my favorite things to do was to use Propulso 5000 against Nat and that paper she was always holding up. Non-lethal Weaponry has its advantages. 
---
I feel like it'd be more like:
---
&gt;Barrels
---

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You really just made my day! 
---
I really need to figure out a way to have higher endurance because right now I'm doing a stealth melee build. And I only have endurance 3 combine that with no power armor and farming ghouls, basically I'm diseased all the time. But now thanks to you I am going to enjoy the healing waters of White Springs on the regular.
---
That‚Äôs a good spot too. Theres one one the cliff south of Denton &amp; Sons Construction near the Ash heap, and a couple in the mire south of the dam.
---
So when a level 50 guy kills you while you are at level 150 you can lose all your chems and 300 caps each time. Sounds good.....
---
I... Didn't know that was a thing. My deathclaw Gauntlet is at 200% and does 299 dmg... But I didn't know the buzz blade and ripper got good... They've always kind of sucked for me.
---
Same with the power armor. The T-60 has so many skins but the raider doesn't have a singal one. I know not many people use it, but it deserves a skin too! 
---
If you scrap the armor helmet you can learn the plans. I got one for 1k caps and scrapped it. Id craft you one but im out of state from my pc for the rest of the w33k
---
MARCY LONG was always the primary target
---
Damn, that's a long time from now
---
As soon as I could, I downloaded the mod that made her non-essential. You can piece together what happened after that. ;)
---
maybe you can contact me next week, whats you ign?
---
This is great....
---
Now I just need to create an excel spreadsheet check list of all my daily chores... Lol
---
It's a bit, sure! But seeing as Wild Appalachia ends at the end of May, I'm sure Nuclear Winter won't be far behind! Maybe a month wait between the two :)
---
Note that there are two ini file sets. Originally the game used the ini files in the program directory. Later they moved to documents/my games/fallout 76.
---
I have a rolling pin stand by now 
---
Hopefully
---
At least it has potential to drop as a 3*
---
Why is wood armor still in the 3* loot pool?
---
Personally, I just don't get it. Generic, bland gameplay with random, childish "humor?" That's all those games are. 
---
The sounds are similar to ones found in shipwrecks and diamond city in Fallout 4. I agree, amazing place.
---
Yea it is a bit annoying seeing them all day everyday. 
---
The easiest way to do this are one foundation camps. You slap down a foundation, you toss up a stair, and you do a ring of floors.  Toss in some walls, place up your work benches, and then blueprint it. After that, add skirt walls down, a roof, whatever, but your blueprint can be placeable anywhere, and you can pop it down, do your crafting, do your scrapping, build around a resource note, whatever. 
---
Same reason drills and syringers are in it.  
---
If you look up the daily challenges and weekly challenges you can get plenty of atoms from that. 
---
That is why it remains uninstalled until the one year anniversary. I hope it will be worth playing for at least a few hours. I hate paying to beta test a game even though I put in close to 300 hours before I quit. It was fun, then it really sucked when I played similar games that are just 20 years ahead of this development.
---
FLAVA!
---
It's common since a patch or two back. I suspect the servers start culling non-critical monsters when the load gets too heavy. Sometimes you'll even get scorchbeasts dropping out of the sky.
---
did they already raise the limit? Thought it was 25k caps
---
It‚Äôs 25k per character
---
Maybe not another "mod", but a finished paint scheme, or an etched finish, would certainly give a finalized aesthetic. Ultimately, it would be ideal if each weapon had a unique "finish". (Ie.: Military weapons - Camo, Western weapons - Etched gold/silver/copper,) giving a little bit more Roleplaying style to an atherwise amourphous character style.
---
Why not 28/30 so I know 2 mods left to learn I dont even need to know what those 2 are ket it be a surprise....
---
My teammate is Fred. I'm Wilma. It would be awesome if everyone knew that.
---
I have two characters that are following the overseers journey and trying to do this as their only quests.  If it was only the overseer, I‚Äôd be sad because I‚Äôm 51/49 on her being dead ;(
---
I deleted the one from the documents/my games/fallout 76.
---
Just after launch, I modified the file to change my pip boy color. Could that have done it?
---
Don't mind a caps stash, but intrest? In a post apocalyptic world? Cahhhmawwnnn
---
I have a collection of drills.
---
And storing five rifles and a gatling gun in a pip boy is post apocalyptic?
---
Nah I agree, perhaps I got a bit carried away with the suggestion, but I think a caps stash is something we all need, I'm honestly surprised this wasn't in the game since launch. 
---
It remains on the list even if it doesn't appear on the main screen. I want to be able to cancel quests.
---
Nope. Definitely wait til it's on sale again which probably will be soon
---
Yea the bayonet looks badass, same one from FO4?
---
Your just a cunt that sees all the problems without offering dolutions. 
---
Besthesda devs: 'All these people and their bobby pin hoarding is killing server performance! What do we do?'
---
Todd Howard:'I'm going on reddit, Hold my beer....'
---
Going rate on here seems to be between 70 and 120 per flux so not willing to go higher than that, I need to double check to see how many I need though
---
Come check me out GT: PurplePplEat3r üòé
---
I‚Äôve killed so many legendaries since getting this game months ago, the best legendary I have found is a two shot pipe pistol, how are people so lucky with explosive guns?
---
Unyielding armor isn't that expensive, you just have to be more open to more options instead of Heavy BoS armor.
---
If you clear out fort defiance there is a wedigo you kill at the end. When you enter through the main door go right instead of left and keep heading in that direction and kill everything and make your way up stairs and through the damn maze it can be and eventually when you get to the top floor there‚Äôs a Wendigo
---
I'll also add that there's a weapon spawn on the table upstairs and I've found a Shishkabab there a few times, along with 1-3 sets of Brotherhood fatigues scattered in the building. Which,imo, is the best under armour in the game as it can be upgraded to have 2+ strength and 1 or 2 endurance. 
---
When a Scorched Beasts drops out of the sky it's actually one you killed earlier. It happens to me fairly often , and I've verified by observing the loot but not taking it. It's the same loot when a dead SB shows up on my doorstep.
---
Yeah removing items that are in the game from the atom store is probably the biggest dick move they've done.
---
Totally agree 
---
Finally some sense. After all this time the game's vaguely resembling something I paid for when it launched. No need to thank them, they're simply doing what they should have done months ago.
---
This is a solid idea. I'd love to have a few ways I could store my money. Maybe not a "bank" but with factions as a way to invest your money. There could even be some risk and reward with each one. 
---
They could make level difference PvP for every zone. For example, in the Forest, you can only attack another player within 10 levels of your own. In Savage Divide you can attack any player within 30 levels of your own and in Cranberry Bog anyone can attack anyone.
---
How about you stfu instead of arguing
---
That'd be a good place, but as far as the wiki says there isn't any. How does the Broadsider have mods and not the Crossbow? The Crossbow could have an upgrade string, trigger, frame, arrow count, or sights.
---
I can craft the helmet. It was not only dev room, but was in beta and is left in game.
---
Flare guns 
---
I‚Äôd love this personally.. at this point with the spawn camping, and the one shots going on... survival isn‚Äôt worth the caps to play.. and I really wanna get into survival.. but it‚Äôs always just a spawn camp fest of one shot kills and cap farming. 
---
Sounds 100 like an universal price 
---
Can you not choose it when leveling up? I'm confused.
---
It's way more effective than the ones we use in real life. Be glad it's just a quick bullet or two that skips and you don't have to reload the entire thing or clear a jam.
---
Your stilll arguing? Wow.
---
Yeah that guys dumb af
---
Honestly interest would destroy the economy pvp is the best way to get caps I don‚Äôt think it would be great to just throw some caps in a box and have 500 extra caps because in game days are like an hour irl 
---
I believe the quest you are referring to was once glitched and kept reappearing, if you do it now it should go away for forever. Otherwise I dont think there is an option or will be an option for what you ask. 
---
Yeah perhaps I got a bit carried away with the whole interest thing. 
---
I know I was able to to abandon a quest the other night. It was an event however, so maybe that's why the option appeared. 
---
Sometimes when I shoot Scorched, if I kill them in 1 shot the physics glitches and sends them sailing through the air...nowhere near the airtime you got there though. 
---
I usually FT back to camp and kill anything first. If if more urgent, sneak in a corner, if it says hidden all good. If not oh well hope for the best anyway ü§£
---
I'd say delete/move all ini files &amp; see where that gets you. It will default the Display &amp; Audio settings, but it should at least be a clean slate to test from.
---
You are not alone. I use a wide array of quality Gatling problem solvers. They all do this from time to time.
---
The entire Asylum is in the same map, so glitches can occur. This one time I kept hearing weird noises while doing my business, the combat music also sporadically activated and I didn't know why.
---
Eventually I finished what I was doing and I prepared to leave....The moment I went downstairs I found myself smack in the middle of a Wendigo, and right charred ghouls, I immediately went back up the elevator as I nearly died, and the entire horde followed me upstairs. 
---
Im interested, too. I would like to add you and hit you up when your back. I can offer you caps or legendaries for it. 
---
My gamertag is a nickname my best friend came up with years and years ago. I decided it to make it my ps4 tag because, well, I never really thought I would be playing an online game and actually socializing with people. It's been *really* funny hearing people refer to me as "muffins" when I've been asked to join teams and such. (Yes, my gamertag is now also my reddit name.) 
---
Imo marine Armoured helmet is the rarest gas mask.
---
I agree BUT it‚Äôs not the only reason to bulk. I do find it more organized and easier to find stuff because it‚Äôs named more logically when bulked sometimes. You don‚Äôt have to worry about whether it‚Äôs loose, waste, etc. 
---
But I stopped doing that because it‚Äôs a waste of plastic. 
---
The odds of me getting 3 pieces of wood armor in a row are astronomical......unless the RNG is weighted towards wood armor. I've got 600+ hours in the game and I don't have a single God roll weapon/armor but I can God roll 3 piece of shit pieces of wood armor that can't even roll 3*'s in a row.

You have to go all the way to the other end of the building, up to L3, then all the way back to where you mention... it's there, it's not glitched, it's killable, it's just it can only be accessed by going the loonnggg way around.

Sounds good to me I'll be on shortly so I'll double check what I need and message you my gt

Yeah. For me when I scroll, I forget which direction, that 13x7 resolution doesn't show in the list, but it's there when I go the other direction.

Is 76 30fps on consoles? That's my biggest gripe with them, I can't go back to shooters that run below 60fps
---
Max the Pharma Farma perk in the luck tree and press the search button on chem containers. 80% chance if finding extra aid items.  It'll help you with stimpacks, radaway, rad-x, disease cures, and antibiotics
---
I want to have character with certain friend groups for different role playing. 
---
Run through morgantown airport. Lots of chem boxes
---
Pharma Farma is a good starting point (luck perk). Buy the recipe from Enclave Medical Bay And always have Super Duper and Chemist equipped when crafting. 
---
Or you can do the absolute lazy way like I do: but them in bulk from Market 76 on Reddit. I carry a minimum of 300 at all times as my build rarely, if  ever, dies. 
---
Says the self-proclaimed member of the mothman cult...
---
I sell all my ammo for 4 bullets a cap (with the exception of Fusion cores, .50 Caliber Balls, prime ammo, and all the other rare ammo), whenever I have too much. It sells out quick. Also why do you have .45 marked as 3 caps, that's way to high (in my opinion). I craft and find all my ammo except Fusion Cores, I almost never buy ammo (I have a few times though).
---
nm 11th time the charm. I was able to get it there. Thanks for that. I will update it in a sec with that location.
---
Really? are they worth that much? I normally just drop mine at containers in stations. (I normally max out the vendors with just stimpacks)
---
Get pharma farma perk and got to flatwoods/vault tec farm. There‚Äôs about 12 chem coolers to search through and you can usually pick up quite a few a day 
---
TBH 150 hrs in and still have never been there! Not a fan of that part of the map 
---
Selling so low that you're taking a loss but being nice?  Or are you still cutting a small profit?

Nice tip!

Watoga emergency services is a good place to run through with Pharma farmer perk.

I don‚Äôt get these posts. Did you honestly think they‚Äôd drop the game cause of the internet being a bunch of loud mouthed haters?

Mirv isn't broken. It just works differently. You don't fire it *at* the target, you fire at it above them. And yeah, that means it doesn't really work with vats.

---
Sucks to say but the only way is to replace your camp. Sorry man.
---
Quake Champions is only played by one person and they keep putting out updated. Fallout 76 will live forever.
---
I also have disposable income but as you just stated it‚Äôs just not worth it at this point to spend actually currency on the game, so the least they could do is fix the bugged out challenges that still plague the game to this day.. it‚Äôs not too much to ask for a feature of the game to be fixed, it‚Äôs been how many months now since the game released? 
---
I think I seen something written on the patch logs awhile back that they addressed this for certain individuals, such as people who have just gotten the game and haven‚Äôt done any challenges yet, but it never fixed the problem with pre-existing players yet, which there is no real excuse for? I get that they are busy with other things, they are a rather large company but they could devote a single person to fix it and I doubt it would take much coding to fix, atleast you would think that.
---
It‚Äôs simply just a matter of the challenge being counted as completed but not checked off within the challenges log, or the challenge being bugged out from the start and being unable to be checked off to begin with. 
---
Maybe they are afraid of accidentally screwing up and making the challenges re-doable for those who‚Äôve completed them or outright just making it bug out more and give out free atoms in mass, even to those who haven‚Äôt actually completed the specifications yet. 
---
Either way they could atleast look into it rather then upright ignore it, it‚Äôs not game breaking but at this point when I‚Äôve completed everything else to do I would atleast like to check off those challenges at this point and unlock something, rather then have nothing to do but make alcohol all day or be forced to buy atoms because I‚Äôm limited to their overly grinding daily and weekly challenges.
---
TL;DR 
---
Would like them to finally fix the bugged-out challenges for pre-existing players for more to do in the end game, rather then force people with limited hours or lack of remaining challenges to grind daily/weekly or buy atoms. 
---
I paid 100 something for the tricentennial package and it‚Äôs kept me entertained since beta so I‚Äôve more than gotten my money‚Äôs worth
---
Mine might have to be SLIGHTLY more expensive just because I‚Äôm out in the boonies. But even then, ammo will always be 1 cap. Stimpacks, 2-3 caps maximum of 5. Decent legendaries 10-20 caps. I‚Äôve never over charged and you can actually buy my stuff and go sell it for profit at the vendors. All junk is 1-2 caps. 
---
And honestly I wish you could switch things like caps between characters easier 
---
The impression I got from a recent interview with the developers is that survival in the future will come in "seasons" where everyone has to start an entirely new character.  They are allowing players with ridiculous OP builds into survival mode so they can see how just how broken the game is so they can fix it
---
dang I was really hoping that wasn't the only answer. Thanks for the help!
---
I prefer flare guns and syringes. At least I know I got fucked before I finish looting the body. Nothing worse than needing Unyielding 3* armor and seeing........ Unyielding...... fucking wood piece.
---
The preservation tubes are those blue ones that were meant to save people from the nukes (think discount vault) but didn't do crap. They could be reworked to drop like power armor and you could chill for a few mins. 
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary, from what I‚Äôve heard of how the CAMPs will work after that update, if you attack the camp (and subsequently do no damage) if the camp has turrets they will attack back- thus entering the camp into PvP and letting you then damage it. 
---
So if the camp has turrets you can still destroy it, and if it doesn‚Äôt have turrets it‚Äôs probably just there for trading or whatever and it‚Äôs not a big deal being there. 
---
No

This isn‚Äôt a fallout thing. 
---
This is a you as a consumer failing to understand the costs of your choice in platforms thing. 
---
Don‚Äôt blame Bethesda for not doing your homework. 
---
Reasons? 
---
Survival is probably one of the best additions to the game they could've done , I was against it at first but now it's my main thing , need those high level weapons to have a chance tho.  Overall imo the game is way better than it once was the people are super nice and the games far less buggy. 
---
Full nope.
---
You are aware that this breaks the rules of the sub right? 
---
Nope, leaving server or just letting them take it over 
---
Do you realize you've replied to a 3 month old post?
---
Yes.
---
I do something similar. I have one foundation. Then put two concrete stairs down, and two metal stairs up. Let's you place one turret on the foundation, and three above to cover that 180 enemies can come up.
---
Nope it popped up 1st in my phone
---
Why would someone spend caps to settle? My Unyielding BOS set was like 3k. If you're not willing to drop a few thousand caps for something like this, you shouldn't be even buying any in the first place.
---
i was joking bruh..approaching 500 hours..been playing since launch..havent played any other game really in between other than when there was a big update and i had to wait hours..im not sure why you stopped playing but ive been having fun since RD
---
Can confirm. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time going the long way around looking for uniforms and scrap.
---
On a side note: I also agree with what you said, there‚Äôs nothing really worth enough to buy with actual money at this point in the atomic shop, maybe if they added realistic prices like you said and didn‚Äôt charge 20-15 dollars worth of atoms for one paint job for your power armor. 
---
If they wanted to charge absurd prices the least they could do is bundle their things in the atomic shop, examples of this would be: Furniture bundle, Power Armor bundle, Weapon and Armor Paint bundle. Etc. with enough content to actually cover the get/cost ratio.
---
I really liked the camp! Thanks for having me.
---
Score:
---
Creativity: 9/10
---
I liked the waterfall design and the camp, however I think a more formal entrance in the front would be great.
---
Looks: 13/15 
---
Once again, looks great. excluding the entrance (area with turrets), the whole camp has a cozy feel and looks amazing!
---
Location: 3/5
---
I liked the use of the stream and waterfall, the lead deposit and the cliff side for your camp. However, the Mire is really far away from most locations, assuming caps are a problem, which, for you, they probably aren‚Äôt, but for me, they definitely are. Also, I assume enemies attack quite frequently but at least the turrets  deal with them.
---
Use: 8/10 
---
You had all the crafting machines, however they were spaced far apart, which could get annoying.
---
BONUS: loved the music area, +1 point.
---
Overall, great camp! Loved it. 34/40
---
No one can pronounce my name either
---

---
just curious..which type of legendary are u looking for? what are the *'s?
---
I was lagging a whole lot at the time, couldn't advance in the main quest due to a bug, and I was dropping from servers like crazy.  I'll definitely have to pick it up again though when I get some free time 
---
Acquire butchers bounty perk card in perception and chemist in intelligence then farm moonshiners shack and the lumber yard south of it. I can usually get 8+tick blood and then I just craft my own stimpacks. You'll have to get the plan for stimpacks, so maybe Google where to find it. Its been about 70 lvls since I got it so I cant remember where it is
---
Referring to that quest specifically, Bethesda are aware of the issue. They plan to provide a fix in an upcoming patch.

server stability has been enhanced greatly..barely any noticeable disconnects recently..they've added additional content..i still havent tried survival yet..but that is soon..im not mentally-prepared yet lol
---
Make friends with a decent pvper. If they dont have a mule they end up vendoring hundreds of stim packs and aid each day once their stash is full. I am sure you can find some one who would rather sell then vendor them.
---
I always just ask them to stop on area chat.  9/10 they do. I usually end up playing with them a little. Today a kids gave me stim, armour, weapons for my low lvl character.  I gave him lead I was harvesting at Poseidon.
---
Yeah, just move camp a couple feet. Things get buggy when you get creative with stairs giving the parts become inaccessible error
---
Assuming you have the recipe for stimpaks (which you can get from the Enclave), max out the perk Butchers Bounty under Perception and Max out both Chemist (under Intelligence) and Super Duper (Under Luck) and go through the Moonshiners Shack and Lumbermill near Vault 76 and kill ticks to get tick blood and the blood sacs. Once you killed the ticks, search them to get more tick blood. While making blood packs on a chem station, having Chemist and Super Duper equipped will net you a lot of stimpaks. I can get around around 50 stimpaks in about 15 mins server hopping those locations.
---
bruh thats not an even trade..go on the market subs they are like 200 caps

For real. Only took them half a year... After most of the people have left and moved on...

Sigh......
---
i am a rifle build..and i love handmades..do you know the extra damage output for AA? 
---
So with PvE melee you absolutely want to stack damage and run around one shotting mirelurk queens and chunking the SBQ. Not the case for PvP. The one shot protection brought in with the last patch means no matter what your damage is it's going to take 2 hits to down someone at full life and still 1 hit against a bloodied build. This means that running bloodied weapons and Unyielding armor is almost a complete waste in PvP. The str is not going to get around one shot protection and you don't need much damage to one off a bloodied build anyway.
---
 So optimally your aim is two hits per kill. It's kinda a bummer if you're used to being a pve one shot machine but the good news is non-bloodied melee weapons are much cheaper. Depending on the base weapon any damage primary becomes a waste. For instance a death claw or super sledge doesn't need a dope legendary affix to two shot. So what should you get? Vampires or suppressor on a high base damage melee weapon. Why? Literally everything else is damage that isn't going to help you kill players faster. These affixes still aren't great but they're really the only things that do anything. Get your sheet damage to around 300, run incisor and martial artist and that's about all you can do as far as killing faster or better is concerned.
---
Armor should be all defense. Unyielding damage isn't necessary and sneaky in PvP is kinda wonky right now. Plus you're melee so almost always you have to go to them. You can't just sit in stealth and make them look because you have to move. 
---
Run stealth boys and adamantium skeleton. This shuts off crits and cripples (Which are also staggers). You're still susceptible to straight stagger chance though same as anyone.
---
Account for crit generation in your build. Crits ignore damage reduction and will be the only way you can kill certain players. Always have one charged and make charging one easy. It can be a real chore with no perks or luck.
---
Get your build as tight as possible. Cut out anything you can that doesn't contribute to your in combat build. Relegate repairs and crafting to another character because you're going to die. A lot. People use guns rather than swords these days for a reason and fallout isn't an exception. You're at a huge disadvantage by not being ranged so do whatever you can to make death less punishing.
---
So following my own advice, I do die constantly and have the lowest kill streak of all my friends but that's expected. And I've still hit caps max at least twice since survival came out.
---
So, mine was bugged. Thank you!
---
That is with an estimate. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs 800 caps or 1200 caps it‚Äôs still too expensive for new players.
---
That's the sad part.
---
Bethesda developers are out of touch with the game and the community. There is no way to contact them and the complaints on this board go unheard while the team works to develop things that people don't even want. Ironically they heard 'Nerf TSE'.
---
It makes no sense though, this is a 50 Cal vs 308! https://m.imgur.com/gallery/gttMH
---
To help another's camp - the build menu comes up like your own?
---
Nah but all my AA weapons rule! It's one of the effects I like most. My anti armor explosive combat shotty rules but there is some debate around that. People say AA an explosive don't work together because explosive is energy and AA and energy is bugged currently. I haven't noticed tho.
---
one thing i have been noticing lately is the glowing ones in WS that arent even legendary sometimes drop 3*..yeah its all over the place
---
Sadly, my CAMP boundary doesn't reach far enough to place an extractor, but I probably wouldn't even if I could, just for aesthetic reasons. Thank you for letting me know, though. I appreciate it and I hope that this information is useful for someone else. It certainly took me a while to notice the node was there in the first place!
---
This is what I do. Then paired with Chem perk and Super duper. I've got 329 stimpacks.....
---
The silver lining is not getting ‚Äúthat name is already taken‚Äù messages.

my next big purchase is actually an AAE..im saving up caps for that..these are actually not that heavy..im gonna have someone mod the crap out of it

I would really like it if they added this into the weekly challenges on survival 
---
My camps have never used a foundation, and are generally built.out of the way (depressions, cliffs, etc.)  They only.consist of the folllowing: armor, weapons, tinker and chem benches, stash, pump well, bed, fire.  Low cost, easily moved, and hidden so no interlopers.  I feel that lack of walls helps.make the place low vis.  Now being pretty compact, I've been able to get some good views.  Best one so far is looking the entire length of Toxic Valley.  I always figured why invest in something superfluous that could  e destroyed?

I managed to complete this fine recently, even at higher levels it seems they're spawning. Might be due to the lack of players farming whitesprings for legendaries?

They themselves said this is the best place to feedback, so no, don‚Äôt change anything, let people post their ideas and be voted and discussed is its own place.

And the sticked thread proves this, BGS with through and updated it with issues and planned releases and nobody saw, they constantly had to point back to that thread to get people to read it.

I've never thought of it as an escape plan. Excellent idea.

Yeah.....if 1*'s were dropping 3* loot we'd get a hot fix for that within 24 hours.

Same, good luck on your journey. Remember to scrap all your weps that are useless and keep an eye out for aluminum.

Yup.  If you are on the same team. You can't move their items or anything but you can place new ones which they can move and/or scrap if they want.
---
Its not a "brightness" issue, its way too much ambient light at night.  In the case of it being to bright its not fixable with monitor adjustments without completely screwing up daytime.  Could be something with HDR makes it darker, not sure how it would though or the people complaining about pitch darkness just need to calibrate their monitor/tv.

All I know is that with the vendor costs for plans being higher now, I'm constantly out of  money. So any prices that are on that order of magnitude, I just can't afford. We'll just have to see how the market settles out.
---
You nailed it on the head. Very overrated games.
---
Lovely idea. You can probably help out a lot of people by looting all of the junky gear you don't need as a high level from safes, steamer trunks, etc and selling them off for a couple caps each

I didn‚Äôt read all this because it‚Äôs way too much to text over a destroyed camp LOL.

Camp repair takes two seconds and a few wood and steel.
---
I was just talking about a bank for us last night a financial friend. Here‚Äôs what I pitched. 
---
I think at this point in the state of the game we don‚Äôt need one. Simply put people are spending caps either really quickly or aren‚Äôt spending them at all or even spending them in short bursts. 
---
With things being overinflated now, a bank would either increase that or reduce it. Really hard to see the affect it would have. 
---
If we do get a bank either the tail end of the summer dlc or the fall dlc would be best. As time will let us see how the cap is valued. 
---
A cross character bank with a max 75,000. Cap limit is fair. And 30 pounds of storage is also fair. 
---
My top three tips would be to remember that inventory management is key. Embrace the friendly players, they‚Äôll be giving you stuff periodically. And have fun exploring. 
---
Wait which console?
---
*Bzz bzzz bzz*
---
Move your camp just a small bit and it should repair itself and would be smart to teach her to log off when they start doing that then relic back in won‚Äôt have to worry about that
---
But so you know not all raiders are ass hats and raiders are a necessity for this game.
---
Didn't even think about it,  but that would really help. 
---
I love my CAMP being next to White Springs. Gives me an easy start up and loot, constantly high level monsters by my CAMP which I always prefer to go back to, next to White Springs which has plenty of vendors, constantly gets nuked with glowy fat bois. It's an excellent spot for a CAMP.
---
lollllll
---
Someone else was just posting about it so I guess it isn't fixed yet. I have a number of quests that I would like to dismiss but of course Bethesda would have to deem that capability important
---
And gears and nuclear and etc.  And that‚Äôs not the point.  Bethesda has made us content for you.  Just think a bit and if you want to be. A raider...do it in survival maybe?
---
Yup, I can get there without rotating the camera at all
---
This place really makes me wish we had an indoor map

Farm snallygasters and set up shop on an acid node.

In my opinion, they are.  Let me opt out of dealing with you shit is all I ask.
---
Pc only
---
You probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing this game then..be it raiders or creatures it would have happened either way
---
Luckies. I wish the Marine Armor was given more love on console.
---
Good place for snally? Toxic valley maybe? I see one once in awhile in Charleston 
---
You deleted something that made it think that the object is now floating. It is possible to backtrack by building pieces...then you could delete the ones you wanted. But it would be hard for me to determine what it is without seeing it.

One day my wife was in here talking to me. I had a soda in one hand and was doing this run with the other. Never changed perspective, just ran it backwards, sideways, etc all while talking to her. After she saw me do it a few times she asked how often I did that... when I told her she gave me a chore list and told me to turn the game off üòÇ

 Chill. Games not amazing. It‚Äôs better than what it was. If we start calling it ‚ÄúAmAziNg‚Äù now then they‚Äôll start to pull back and think we‚Äôre content with what we have.

I think the point of OP is to make camping behind the golf club against the rules. Screwing up the entire server's Whitespring's golf club loot for everyone is the reason why.  Anytime you do something that costs a player the possibility of a legendary drop with something this obnoxious and self serving is asking to get griefed and murdered.  There are MILES and MILES of land to build on in the world so making the area behind the golf club a no build zone is not going to cause a housing crisis.  It will instead solve a ghoul crisis at the golf club created by camping right behind the golf club. If they do the same douchery elsewhere that's 'hot' for legendaries, it will result in the same treatment by the same players.  I'm not a fan of backdoor campers and I don't actively destroy anyone's camp, but I'll watch someone else do it and not feel bad at all if it's a camper at the golf club.
---
If BSG decides to go ahead and make bases invincible AND still allow campers outside the back door of the golf club, I'm predicting that there will be a group of vigilante players who will make that camper's time on the server  un-fun in the same way they are making the game un-fun for everyone else except them.  If the turrets are still vulnerable after patch 8 then you'll have target practice on turrets behind the golf club a new unofficial event. It could even get entertaining with all the different kind of mines and weapon possibilities.
---
The smart thing is for BSG to do is disallow golf club camping in Adventure mode and encourage it in Survival mode which has a way of dealing with this kind of thing a little differently.  Either way it will be entertaining to see what develops as this is going to have to come to some conclusion one way or the other.

If you‚Äôre talking about the keycard all you have to do is find a point where it goes over. They travel the same route choose a spot where it‚Äôs closer to the ground and is close and stay there and wait for it to come to you.

I have a powered door on my compound and security fencing around it. When I spawned in, whilst outside fhe fence I heard a scorched babbling. I looked around, no turrets firing, figured was a glitch. Went inside, through the closed gate and keypad security door, and scorched was INSIDE my house. It had completely destroyed two things... my Mothman Poster and Vaultboy Statue... was weird and kinda funny, but whats the point of security doors and fences if they can spawn inside your home?

I haven't played in a while. My character was/is named Gabe Lincoln and I wear the Civil War era costume. If people saw my name they'd get my costume. Instead, they see that I am a stoner.

Mine works in VATS. It doesn't do any damage to the target......as in 0 DMG. Lock on target.....launch nuke.....huge explosion......target comes out with full health. I hit a super mutant from the roof of West Tek with 4-5 mutants standing next to him 4x(24 lbs of nukes) and didn't scratch a single mutant nor did they even notice me..... didn't even break my sneak.

I consider that broken.

Does it work if you're overencumbered?
