I didn't know I needed to go into a nuke zone for PVF. Thanks for the info. If that's the case, I'll wait. I wasn't planning on being a noob in a zone until I hit Lvl 50 at least, don't want to be in the way.
---
At Lvl 50 I was planning on running around and taking out everything I could on the ground.
---
Erm what?
---
I‚Äôm not following any build lol it seems like you‚Äôre angry about something else 
---
Thank you so much!
---
I had already figured out that it had something to do with my Fallout76Custom.ini (because it isn't the first time that i had this happen) but was clueless on how to solve it.
---
Thanks again for helping me out.
---
Uh, edgy.
---
Totally. I habe my set fully Polymer and Ultra Light...but like you said, just can't do it without legendary effects.
---
And it‚Äôs not about my weapons it‚Äôs about not bitching and just playing the game üòÇ
---
Username checks out lol. Also pretty low level troll op go ahead and waste time writing a reply. I'm not here to read it
---
13 mutations times 500 caps is how much?   Because the player that walks through a decontamination arch or uses a RadAway could lose all their mutations to get rid of Adrenal Reaction just to reacquire it.  Then they would have to pay for all those replacement mutations.   It would be much better if Bethesda would just search all accounts that have Adrenal Reaction that also don't have the benefit applied properly and apply the benefit effect back to the account.   They could write a script that does it at login or they could just mass-fix all characters at once.  They can search all accounts for duped crap, they can do this.
---
Those are nice but I wouldn't even call them god rolls.
---
I tried multiple of those.  Didn't count.  Didn't complete.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Have you gotten this week's "Kill a Huge Creature" quest to complete?  Or are you just tossing suggestions?
---
I can re- equip the weapon after I get in or out, I dont think that fix is for this issue, also I never had this issue until after this patch.
---
&gt; any amount of ultracite ammo past like 3k imo are bullshit.
---
lol You're adorable. I crafted 20k ultracite .50 just on the day I put a prime receiver on my bloodied explosive .50 cal, and that was only a bit before the TSE nerf. Since then I've crafted well over 100k of ultracite .50, keeping about 15-20k of it in inventory at any given time and burning 1-5k each play session (SBQ obviously eats a bunch; back to back to back SBQ kills before server hopping for more = a lot of ammo).
---
That's a long list...probably should have been fixed before release.
---
I do just tired of complaining idiots who lost all their stuff or got banned and then cry about it. BooiHooo !
---
It's a location in game
---
Exactly
---
I just logged on for the first time since patch and walked through a crowd of scorched in crouch (wearing marine) and never left hidden. I took a few pot shots at a 48 super mutant (I'm 74) and never left caution. Soon as he was dead I was back in hidden.
---
Not sure if escape artist works (or has ever worked / will ever work) but it seems like I'm spending a lot more time in hidden.
---
Can you not see them if you havent bought them? I cant find them in that section anywhere
---
but the ban was to combat duping, If he was not duping what's the point?, is true maybe he violated some TOS, but there should be different types of bans. And I think that when a game has a problem and a lot of people exploits that, is more a problem of the game, that from the people.
---
Because they definitely wouldnt drop stuff then screenshot their inventory to prove their innocence
---
Oh I see thank you I was rather confused!
---
You're welcome :D
---
This is actually even more important and I think they said it‚Äôs coming (?)
---
Maybe you should go back to fortnite 
---
oh, after just reading the title I was about to type "yeah, in my X-01 PA" but then I read the post...  that's cool, I have always wanted to do both, and proximity flying, but my back is fucked up so I can't...
---
Nope; didn't work.  Even after relogging.  Even tried applying a 2nd serum on top of the 1st try.
---
OP has 810 in their name or august 10 if you add a 1 to both its 9/11..Conspiracy proven! 
---
There's a lesson in there somewhere.
---
Leave Bethesda to discover the duping methods because they did such a GREAT job finding them on their own in the past and fixing them almost immediately /s
---
Despite meaning well it's used by those caught in the act quite a lot. Giving yourself an alibi in advance such as writing a note saying you were going along to a drug deal to catch a drug dealer. Then if you're busted by undercover police you try and say, "I was only doing this to help catch the bad guys." It doesn't work. I'm not saying you are doing this but that it could be viewed in this light.
---
Anti-armor ranged does pretty solidly against me in PvP, certainly makes me approach PvP with strategy when going against those that know how to use it.
---
Definitely not just run up and whack until one of us dies otherwise the AA will usually tear me up.
---
Should they boost ranged? Of course, we need more options than just AA or melee, that‚Äôs really boring at this point.
---
I dont think you read what he claimed. He said he crafted the ammo but he never crafted as much as the email says. He said they may have detected him transfering ammo between alts. You are helping no one by being toxic on this sub. 
---
Some barely coherent mess that's basically defending people while simultaneously taking a swipe at casual players. You're a real piece of work. keep using those emojis ppl will definitely take you seriously
---
whoa dude i was just recommending you might enjoy filthy casuals because its full of people that are enjoying this game rather than "fucking cheaters" that you were griping about, but on second thought i don't think its a place for you
---
&gt; You have carnivore. That and herbivore have known bugs associated with them preventing you from gaining further mutations.
---
That was patched quite a while ago.
---
Does salt ever *leave* the menu, really? 
---
Nah, the roads part was a joke. 
---
It's to help attract the mothman! lol
---
What about ultracite POWER ARMOUR?
---
You could actually see them if you haven‚Äôt got them with an atom store sign , yellow if have gotten it red if not 
---
Same problem here.
---
Shoot them in the face for not sharing their stuff
---
No.  TSE was overpowered.  I find it incredibly frustrating that they nerfed TSE into oblivion.  Bethesda overreacted and went too far with it.
---
Also, No, I do not think that Melee doing high damage is bad.   Melee has to get up close and personal. They have to take a lot of damage in order to deal a lot of damage.    Is there room to dial them back a little bit?  Maybe, but I would fear that Bethesda would do the same thing to them that was done to the TSE and now we'd have no weapons that can be built up to do good damage.   
---
Keep in mind, these aren't people that are just walking out of the vault doing that kind of damage.  These are people that leveled up, got the right legendary weapons, the right perks, the right build / stats for their character, the right mutations, the right armor...  they literally created a build to do high damage.  They earned that.   If an argument can be made that 2000 damage per slow swing is too much, then maybe dial it back to 1700 or something BEFORE damage resistance perks / before armor, etc.   
---
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
---
Most people in this game are down for helping out like that. I had a super dope experience with a guy myself like this. He built me excavator armor...ever since I went up 27 levels lol.  I've really only run across a couple d bags the whole time I've played since beta. If your on Xbox..I just decided to open a shop. It's right by Morgantown town train station. I have loads of lower and upper level legend gear and weapons for the low. 
---
With a proper alibi, or video footage of the incident in question, a negative can be proven (at least within a reasonable doubt).
---
Suppose the guy had game footage or home security footage of himself playing all 900 hours that could be reviewed to show him crafting all the ammo and never duping...
---
Fun fact: I tried it and it entirely removed my mutation
---
Liiteral child confirmed 
---
Well sir, i use it because I like it :T
---
You were a griefer that harassed some random guy with a workshop for hours on end. You used duped TSE and duped meds. You used the out of combat damage glitch to kill without being in PVP. We only started spanking you once I'd follow you to hurt you when you went to use more duped meds. You ran away and started harassing other workshops. All you've done is defend banned people for two days. I hope they caught you and I never see your again. ü§£üëç
---
Sometimes people sell it but its not a natural item they sell. Its only in their inventory if another player sells it to them.
---
As a fellow Home head I can feel a lil of what your saying....especially with the camps and decorating along with finding different outfits....now if I can ever get that pool table to work....
---
I‚Äôm not pressed to be taken seriously on Reddit maybe that‚Äôs the root of your anger 
---
I received some sort of huge creature notification after offing a behemoth 
---
Actually I am not using mods, have never used mods.
---
Ironclad is not worth it.
---
You are aware he did try and help the community right? What do you gain from him being banned under the assumption he was a false positive? If you know nothing about his account why do you assume him a cheater? Actually sad to see that this sub is so toxic to others for no reason.
---
They absolutely should try new things, but they should also allow for optional functionality. I think it was safe to assume quite a large percentage of Fallout fans were big fans of the single player PVE experience and were curious to explore without feeling forced into certain elements. Something like PVP enabled servers vs not would have been a terrific preventative measure and everyone could have what they want in that respect.
---
As for a "casual sensitive" I don't think that's kind, appropriate, or accurate. Someone disliking competition or pvp does not mean that they are overly sensitive or not serious about their gaming. I spend quite a lot of time gaming, and titles by Bethesda are always at least a hundred hours per game. I just don't get the same joy from playing against people and feeling stressed when I game. Getting griefed, however common, makes the game less enjoyable for me and stressful. Common does not mean desirable. That's why most players who dislike it tend to avoid such titles (hence me uninstalling this game once it reached a point that it was negatively impacting my experience).
---
You literally post in fortnite subreddits 
---
why wouldn't you go with the Forrest/Urban Operative Underarmor?
---
not a matter of hard to find, it forces you to have way too much at any given time. shotgun users and energy weapon users can't afford the luxury of having their items bulked mainly because its simply too much plastic.
---
Is it possible to get his ip and his fallout username?
---
Yeah it's a good game, you literally prowl people's Reddit history online to make a glancing blow in a conversation? That's fucking sad dude. 
---
&gt; 13 mutations times 500 caps is how much?
---
Google can do simple multiplication for you. Try it out.
---
You can also get serums for FREE just by providing the materials. They're a joke to craft, even if you wipe your mutations completely it's only 39 flux.
---
But if you just want to whine about the problem go right ahead and don't get yourself fixed.
---
I CANT GET IT BACK HELP
---
Sometimes, but not always. To this day i'm innocently banned from XBox Live for having done nothing, and nobody on the XBox team could tell me why i was banned, but they were all quick to assure me that looking into this case is unnecessarry, because they only ban with evidence, so if i was banned, that's evidence enough that they had evidence at the time and therefore the ban is valid. 
---
Damnit Jim!  I'm a doctor, not an architect!
---
ok sounds good. I have the BOS combat leg plan
---
Haven't had any issues...yet.
---
No, no it is not. Reddit has privacy for a reason. 
---
One of the funnest moments I had was hunting /getting hunted in a white springs nuke zone. You think the monsters are scary? Try it with 2 guys in PA chasing you also! Lol
---
That's awesome man. I have never had that many different types of mobs spawn
---
Haha. My bad. 
---
Source? 
---
Except apparently they've apologized to someone because they screwed up, I haven't found the exact details but this is what I was just told.
---
Also there's a big difference between the shit you're saying and the truth. The truth is that there's plenty of players that understand how this game works, have been storing excess items on alt characters since the game came out and only allowed 400 in your stash, compared to today's 800- that's a huge fucking difference.
---
Also, I'm not banned nor am I defending people who *actually dupe*.. but there's a big difference between that and people who can get the materials to craft anywhere from 10-100k ammo I'm 3-15 minutes.
---
Also players who have been trading from day one, knew how to make a profit and trade up into better weapons and armor from the first month, compared to players that today only have a few 2* legendaries.
---
There's those who got a lot of levels legit and are good at the mechanics in the game and there's those who simply play more, then there's those who do both.
---
If you've played half as much as I have and you haven't found good places to farm legendaries, or perhaps you don't do certain events, you're going to accuse players like me if cheating, when what it really is, I have a better mastery than you do of the game, like 900 hour guy who's played over twice what I have, likely has an even better mastery because of time alone, if not skill too.
---
So yeah, when I see noobs calling people cheaters because of how much ammo they've accumulated over 900 hours of play, I correct them and explain how easy it is to craft ammo(of all things, it's the fastest and easiest in the entire game).
---
But because you haven't played enough **or** tried doing as many things, you default to "they must be cheating" because you don't personally see how they've done it.. not because they actually cheated.
---
And this has been true 100% of the time with the people I've replied to, the average player defaulted to whitesprings for leveling rather than try different events, explore different places and find places to farm, and rely on scrapping for ammo materials rather than learn where ore nodes are where you can get it 100-1000x faster than scrapping.
---
I'm not crying about it, I think its hilarious

They have an atom icon that appears next to one I‚Äôve got stored that‚Äôs in the tricentennial paint, so it‚Äôs possible! 
---
The biggest problem I see is that to get the op damage it requires heavy perk card investment, and running a low health bloodied/unyielding build. While with tse it required just a few perk card investments and you could use it in power armor. 
---
Tse did not require a min max build to get insane damage output, op melee does
---
With my in armed build, I get ~350 with my deathclaw gauntlet. That is with lvl 3 iron fist, lvl 3 incisor, lvl 1 bloody mess (I am still working on respecing), herd mentality on a team, talons, and twisted muscles. And I am a piece of paper in a nuke zone. 
---
I do agree that my particular build is far from ideal, it represents what I feel most casual players would set up with. 
---
My 2h melee is even worse can‚Äôt even break 300 damage with it. 
---
He's not the only element in this story that makes this bad. Many people blindly believed him. 
---
Damnit Bethesda! Can't you fix one little thing without breaking something else?
---
Yeah that's most likely true. 
---
Ahh you were one of the guys last night weren‚Äôt you?
---
If you understood this game you wouldn‚Äôt sling such bullshit accusations. 
---
I don‚Äôt have any explosive weapons at all - don‚Äôt you know what they sound and look like? I was killing you with a one star, Double Double barrel Shotgun and a one star Executioner‚Äôs 50 cal.
---
You and your buddies followed me everywhere. Three of you versus me. I left the shop that you attacked me at and you followed me all over the map. You clearly chose to keep PvPing me. I didn‚Äôt hop or mind since you fed me several thousand caps over that period.
---
Who‚Äôs the griefer if you followed me where ever I went?
---
And no, I‚Äôm not banned at all. I killed all three of you with one star weapons and two star armor, no sentinel and no exploits. You kept on coming for hours. I‚Äôm happy with the caps you provided.
---
Well, you would deserve it
---
I was benefiting greatly from this as I use a Vampiric Gatling as anti SB/SBQ weapon. The crank speed for 3 points gave +30% DPS and thus fast healing. Now it no longer works and I can get only +15% DPS by upping 3x1 Heavy Gunner by that many points but the healing is still the base fire rate. I got pretty close to death after my first post-patch SBQ fight; I never had to spam stimpaks for her before.

---
I reacquired the mutation and it worked for a while, then after re-logging and contracting a disease it's no longer working.
---
Could the team consider allowing certain limited time power armor skins please made available again?  I have been adamantly saving 1800 atoms for months just in case the blackbird paint comes back.
---
I just tested your theory. I got rid of all my mutations and then drank all 11 serums again, with Carnivore last. I had to re-log in order to get the numbers to update, but it looks like that worked.
---
Was it for this week's weekly challenge?  Please double-check if the weekly challenge for this week is listed as completed.  There are non-weekly challenges that can trigger off of this as well, but this thread is only and specifically asking about the 2/19 weekly challenge.
---
Thats actually a great idea. Thanks. I'll check it out when I get home. 
---
Well that's great but thank the dev team, Todd had nothing to do with any of this I'm sure.
---
i need to amend my statement, as i am now experiencing this bug.  i dont know if its related to being idle for too long or vats, but suddenly i wont be able to hot swap weapons with d pad as OP states.

&gt;  Signs point to yes.
---
I haven‚Äôt got banned or am crying about anything other than you‚Äôre lacking sense of humor 
---
Can confirm.  The 4k mutation I JUST BOUGHT is now doing nothing except lowering my HP.  Lmfao.
---
The email is back in the first post, the 900 hour guy transferred 140k ultracite ammo on his account. Not 600k as OP is suggesting here. That is in association with a second "account" not character or alt. This post is misleading.
---
My alternate account isn't banned yet, just had all the items removed. 
---
Still waiting for the glorious email.
---
Two Deathclaws and a scorchbeast and it didn‚Äôt pop for me. The challenge itself must be bugged. I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Ya, it is not.

There is a battle for the heart of the game in this sub, and I intend to fight it.

The brigading from cheaters over the dupe purge that ended up being nothing and the subsequent ban wave show that cheaters are here, lurking, waiting to stir the pot and corrupt objective decision making by Bethesda.

The last few days have been really eye opening.

That doesn‚Äôt mean the OP is not having this issue.

I will try it. I don't see the hat in my apparel tab though? I will take a look at it tonight. If I go to the Atom shop I see it and it has owned on it. Also, I bought some face paint months ago and haven't figured out to apply it lol. The Atom shop didn't tell me how to apply it in the game, PS4 user. Thanks for the reply!

The higher level you are the more camp budget you have.

odd you're showing . I was going to join your server. If you want, join to my server.

REACQUIRE?  I just spent 4 THOUSAND CAPS on it yesterday.  I am not REACQUIRING anything concerning I'm not going to screw up the other 7 mutations I already have trying to REACQUIRE it.  BGS you need to FIX IT.

Can we upvote the shit out if this....

You seem pretty young so I don't think you have a job to lose or anything, it wouldn't matter if they did get your IP. Probably just selling for weed money so guessing like 14. I say this because you come off as really juvenile/probably brain damaged

I am not one of the guys from last night, no. I'm one of the guys you griefed a month ago, right before the TSE Nerf, right after you posted on reddit.com asking for the bug that let's you kill people that you're not in combat with.  I look forward to running it back, seeing as you're not banned and the field has been leveled.

&gt;Troubleshooter's Super Sledge with 40% faster swing and 90% reduced weight

I'll begin by saying "god roll" is wholly subjective and essentially whatever you want it to be, but that's hardly a god roll. +% power attack and +str would be better.
---
&gt;Anti Armor DCG with 40% faster swing and 90% reduced weight
---
melee weapons don't benefit much from anti-armor because of incisor. again, +% power attack and +str would be better. and a power fist, not a deathclaw gauntlet, would be the best roll.
---
&gt;Bloodied Gauss Rifle with faster reload speed and +250 dmg resist while ADS

explosive is the logical choice here. but anything vats-related would be better as well. +agi for dodgy or even more vats-related mods for the minor.

&gt;All looted by me. Never duped. 
---
like I said, it's subjective, but those hardly qualify as god rolls. rolling random, albeit decent, 3\*s like those is a lot easier.
---
&gt;And at least 3 pieces of my Unyielding AP Refresh Heavy Combat set
---
and rolling 2\*s is even easier. not saying it's easy, not at all, just easier. if those were sentinel/cavalier as well, then I'd be impressed.
---
&gt;So, your comment is invalid.

sorry but not really.

Lol - there were 2 lvl80's and a lvl50 at WS last night.

If you weren't banned, there is no logic behind white knighting those that were. It makes you look suspicious as fuck.

24 hours would be ideal, and not unreasonable. I'm sure they know at least that far in advance which server will be offline when.

I guess if you bring your car to the garage to get it serviced and they break the clutch in the process you are happy to buy a new clutch too right?

 "There is a duplicate version of the Bowler Hat, simply named 'Bowler', that is separate from standard Bowler Hats but not discernably different "

FWIW, "Bowler" count's as a formal hat for challenges and "Bowler Hat" does not.  Pretty annoying.

The cable which comes with the bq35 is a pure sound cable. You can not use the microphone with it.

Sadly, you have to buy a bq25 cable to get it to work, then the inline mic from the cable can be used. For PC you mostly also need a y-adapter to split your cable to audio and micro to be able to plug it in to your PC.

If you want cost efficiency then try to farm good mutations through natural means then buy the rest. I just went through a Decon arch and completely renewed with a my specific mutations set

Have you ever tried playing the game with 39 HP?  No...then you probably shouldn't talk about things you dont understand.
---
Right, but after 5+ levels of still having budget maxed out, it only increases when I move the camp. I've had to physically move and replace in the same spot my camp to see the budget increase, over three or four series of 5+ level increases. Is anyone else having that issue?
---
Worked for me, thanks for sharing! 
---
Thank you. Reporting in that killing the Behemoth twice, 5 Deathclaw, and  a Grafton monster did not pop it for me either.
---
I always dump extra plans, ammo and misc junk in the cash registers in front of the vendors. I‚Äôve also been fortunate enough to find some much needed ammo and unread plans at some of the same places I dump! Absolutely love it when we help each other out in the wasteland! 
---
Not without exploiting you arent lmao.
---
You are incorrect.
---
For whatever reason, one of my suits has an Atomic Shop symbol on it even though I don‚Äôt own any skins (the aforementioned suit says the headlamp is from the Atomic Shop).  Makes it a lot easier to differentiate between my Excavator, Ultracite, and X-01 as one of the other two is always in my inventory.  It might be a pricey option but painting one suit (if you have two or three) makes up for not being able to name individual suits of power armor.  Just putting it out there for consideration.
---
Possibly. 
---
Got ya. I came to check out the subreddit from r/all was thinking of giving the game a shot but I was drawn in to all the arguing about cheaters etc.

2 of those are high risk/high reward setups.  TSE pre-need gave you more base damage without low HP high rad requirements.  Basically something for nothing.  My TSE shotgun was 1600 damage before Adrenalin perk being used, my highest damage all rise is ~390 and after Adrenalin maxed about 900.  
---
That is without a low HP/high road build so pretty inferior to TSE plus you had the really monstrous advantage of range. 
---
Now my sledge does about 100 more damage than my strongest gun but without the range advantage, not a huge trade off *IMO.  
---
That unyielding bloodied is a super special build pain in the rear to pull off.  Not everyone has sentinel Assasins is god armor set or bloodied strength swing speed god weapon.  
---
I have died to ranged players just like I‚Äôve died to melee players with good setups equally prior to the latest patch that just dropped when I did play here and there sporadically.  I did notice a sharp drop in TSE style griefing, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
Awesome thanks I might take you up on that but idk I might be done with this game. I took a break for a couple days to try Zelda and I think the only thing that will bring me back now is new content or some significant positive changes to explore. But I don't feel like logging on just to fix a problem
---
Cool. Come get some anytime man. I‚Äôm game. I win some and lose some.
---
I never relied on TSE. I had a lvl 15 TSE that I lifted and I dropped it a long time ago. I have the same shotgun now that I killed you with then. Gotta love that 4 ammo double barrel. It wreks.
---
And you‚Äôre calling workshop PvP griefing? Okay. And that Reddit Post turned out to be because I didn‚Äôt understand how workshops worked back then and got flagged and killed.
---
Go ahead and accuse people of cheating because you lost some fights. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a shortage of people who can‚Äôt just lose and accept it.
---
I love how you just *know* how it's all done.

You are spewing bullshit to get people on your side by trying to add "logic" and "math" to it, but at the end of the day it is just utter bullshit.
---
You claim your accounts aren't banned, but you are sure are putting in a lot of effort toward the idea that Bethesda somehow banned thousands of "innocents."
---
There is bottlecap icon but is it free? That one would have been perfect for trade. Plans just the only one I could think of that people wouldn't use in a million years. Thanks for proving me wrong. 
---
And, for the love of Atom, have SOME SORT of predictable loot pool for each enemy type so we can reliably farm the legendary weapons and armor we actually want instead of ending up with shit like legendary ROLLING PINS. (Aside, if anyone wants my AA legendary rolling pin, pm me) loot pools are not complicated and have been a thing in MMO's for a very long time.
---
Not only that, but you will never see a player that is below level 50 that outputs insane numbers for melee. If I remember correctly there were lvl 5 tse shotguns that were floating around that would one shot almost everything. Tse was very op with little perk investment. 
---
(I never ran a tse build nore ever had one, so I don‚Äôt have the numbers with or without perks for them, but I remember talking to people that did run that meta) 
---
I run a primarily unarmed build with a little ruffle and shotgun mixed in. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDiHxJL-e7I
---
keep in mind his build is "meh"
---
And I think you missed my point- the people that are higher level and have reached end game content sooner didn't depend on cheats that were less efficient or dupes to bring prices down to make reaching that content easier- they were there ones getting those first weapons that were later duped for example.
---
I guess my point is I think there's people that cheated trying to use that advantage to catch up or bypass the people who were in the lead, but those things never gave them any kind of advantage over people that were legitimately farming legendaries from day 1.
---
I honestly was behind many, others were way over level 50 before the beta ended and already learning what nuking was when I was maybe level 19?
---
It was networking and learning/trading with other players that gave me any and all advantage I had. It was spending countless hours on nukedragon website figuring out my build and asking players I met what they're doing that got my build pretty solid by level 70, and rock solid by 120, with refining and testing different things with levels after that.
---
But sure, there's people looking for shortcuts, and those shortcuts actually weren't short.. playing the game like you were meant to and learning from others is what got you farther faster.
---
Bro if you were brain damaged would you even know you were brain damaged? Looked through your post history and your comments actually do seem like that lol. Sorry I'm high asf rn
---
You are very welcome
---
It worked for a Grafton monster 
---
Yeah. I am nervous cause i totally did the xp glitch to get from 25-30. (Spamming the fire trap). Hoping i dont get banned.
---
Good thing the pretend currency you get while supposedly having fun in a game isn't real money.
---
I've heard people say similar things, and that scrapping everything and rebuilding works best. Not ideal, I know
---
Happens regularly to our group on PC as well, though I thought it had been less frequent over the past week. 
---
It‚Äôs widely reported. 
---
It was a joke he was trying to say. Not a good one but still a joke.
---
And who exactly power attacks in PVP? It's a VATS fest in there. My build is optimized for PVP, nothing else. And + str? Did you even read my post? I use Unyielding. Plus Radicool. 40 str there. Any more is overkill. 
---
My Sledge is a God Roll for silos. I don't die in there anymore and I'm running a 20% hp build. Everything goes down in 1 hit, including those bastard Assaultrons and Gutsys. 
---
As for the Gauss, sure it's not the best but imo it was a decent roll. Explosive is unnecessary and what's the point of VATS when you meet someone running Cham armor or Stealth Boys? And + agi? Again, Unyielding fixes that problem. 
---
The more you talk the lower my opinion of you is. + stats is NEVER better due to the existence of Unyielding. 
---
So, yes, your comment is invalid. Maybe even more invalid than before. 
---
You don't need to justify yourself to me and you're trying too hard to do it to literally everyone whenever the topic comes up.  Separate yourself from "dupers" - ask ask yourself why you  see yourself as one.
---
Update: I just re applied adrenal reaction to my main, it was the second to last mutation of 11 to come off, and I am now gaining the positive benefits, thx bugthesda.
---
&gt;Armor: The Punishing legendary effect no longer reflects ‚Äúslap‚Äù damage dealt by another player. This should prevent cases where a player wearing Punishing armor could become Wanted unintentionally due to reflected damage that killed their attacker.
---
What about Reactive Plates for power armor? It does this too. I had to stop using it because people were making me wanted.
---
&gt; i think that whole episode was a children of the corn homage actually.
---
It's part Children of the Corn, part Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. 
---
Is the ability to engage PVP anywhere on the map by failing to claim a workshop still in the game? because if it is fuck Bethesda for making it easier for assholes to do it.
---
I don't see plan in inventory when trade window opens
---
Interesting, thanks for the heads up!
---
Did they nerf bloodied also or is it the adrenal reaction bug that you're talking about?
---
Hm, that actually makes sense.
---
Oh I see, well I've had very limited problems since launch. (Not different from any other fallout game at launch. Lol) So i guess thats why I didnt catch the sarcasm.
---
Right, man. You gotta go to the doctor
---
It is if you want some protection while in a hazmat suit.  Every little bit extra counts.  With normal armor, less so.
---
What annoys me is the inconsistency. Sometimes I'll look at my Apparel while in PA and see that my regular armor is still equipped, I can even unequip it while in PA (but not put it back on). Then, the other 90% of the time, it shows them unequipped. Haven't been able to deduce the cause yet.
---
On X1 here. The update killed all in-game sound. Everything from the loading screen to menu to literally everything.
---
Is Bethesda going to give me the serum or do I need to pony up caps even though I already bought the serum?
---
...And I filled up my stash box again.  200 extra pounds off my character inventory went FAST.  But like someone else said, hooray for not being over encumbered...for the moment.
---
Is he wrong?
---
I mean I‚Äôve killed a duper that had 50k steel scrap on them one time...so if I were  to be banned...how do they justify that? 
---
I mean does the cosmetic item have stat changers? If your answer is other than yes then you are right. 
---
It's nice to know it's not just me, at least.
---
With what 10% health and 90% rads?  Oh and if you have another enemy around to snipe that last 10% off, dead.  
---
I‚Äôd love for my 330 damage super sledge to hit at 2,000 without the high death risk build that is unyielding and all that stuff, but it doesn‚Äôt....
---
sus...  word...  well I never said every ban was wrongful...  it's most likely a mixture, I mean as I said, I have never seen this many claims on social media before, usually it's a few dozen or so, this time there were literally hundreds of claims of false bans, I am sure some, maybe most, of those claims are BS, but math says by the numbers alone at least some of them are wrongful, I mean it's not like the engine the game runs on is outdated af or anything...  and the engine is only one of a myriad problems this game has...
---
Can you make scaly skin?
---
It may be a placebo effect but when I play with my brother or wife we wait for one person to load in before fast traveling or entering a door. It seems to have cut down on this error.
---
It balances the negativity on this forum really well. 
---
Oh sorry. Thanks for correcting me. 
---
&gt;red Mothman headlamp that works once Mothman Power Armor is equipped.
---
Say what now?
---
I'm still waiting on you, I have the plan on me. my gt is phishntrips   I added you, but you are showing offline and I dont see you in my world list. you may be trying to trade with the wrong person
---
Damn, that guy really needs to take a shower. That hair looks dirty.
---
No, the person I know has already been banned once.
---
Yes considering  each costume was 800 points and if you play the game 800 atoms is nothing 
---
I'm not and I don't. There's a difference between cheaters and people that learned how to play the game and basically "got good". People that have played earlier or played more, or just played differently than people who just did lots of nukes.
---
My point was a long winded way of saying one thing =/= the other, that people are making baseless accusations based on assumptions that "you can't possibly": whatever they're trying to say you can't do/have by playing legitimately. That you don't have reasons to have so much ammo or what the fuck ever, when you don't need a fucking reason for anything in this game if you don't pay attention to it.
---
You prove my point every time you or others name assumptions about my character based on bullshit you decided means something more than it actually does.
---
Missing the point there. It should not one shot
---
You know he posted that picture himself right? 
---
Hi There! Please Clarify "reaquire" because if I have to Cure and "reaquire" my Mutations that is going to take Weeks and involve much expense. This is unacceptable to me and I would like a better fix. Thank You!
---
If we have no way of knowing then why bother sharpening Pitchforks?
---
damn yr lucky its not giving you rads
---
No because they only were effective during the event so the cosmetic items activated a perk that disappeared on Tuesday
---
Yeah, I already had to lose almost so my mutations once, to get rid of a "phantom" marsupial (only shows up when suppressed by rad x) that was preventing me from getting the actual marsupial. Didn't cost me anything, because rather than try to buy settings, I just went and got *every* mutation. Even if it didn't cost anything though, the time and effort...
---
And now I get to do it again. Hooray!
---
Does anybody knows where to find this???
---
Nice way of Bethesda passing responsibilities on your son, right? Do not protect them.
---
I have a few mutations that give penalties to my SPECIAL stats (marsupial, eagle eyes, egg head) and I have noticed that after the patch my STR and END are now at 0, and if I remember correctly they used to be capped at 1.
---
Also it seems that weapon damage is quite a bit lower, I'm using an instigating combat rifle that was pretty good for high-tier super mutants pre-patch, but the mutants are back to being bullet sponges now - going through ammunition very fast.
---
I think you misunderstand. He‚Äôs charging 60 an hour to help you. 
---
How much do you make an hour? $13? $15? Maybe $18? 
---
See what I‚Äôm getting at? It was just a silly joke is all 
---
I killed her 3 times yesterday and none of those fights were even remotely as much of a PITA as this one
---
you do realize that apex is just a way for EA to sell you $20 micro's right?
---
We have been for months now
---
No, no, no, no...we shouldn't pay, that is almost a pay2win scenario. 
---
So you'll toss 5 points into END and possibly cripple your build just for +50 dmg/energy resist? Cool story bro, still useless. 
---
You know, now that I think about it, I am wrong. I have my WV lore mixed up! The Flatwoods Monster is also known as the Braxton County Monster. The Grafton Monster has always been as just that. My fault!
---
Go on as long as you'd like, your post history is visible. You say you never bought anything, you've got multiple marketplace posts. You just "picked up" a TSE? You mean bought one? A duped one? Anyone who questions you us just mad that you beat them? I dunno, friend. I've seen more of you than I care to and it all points to one thing, doesn't it? ü§î I accuse you of cheating because I witnessed it in game and see evidence of it on Reddit.com. It has nothing to do with the fact that you beat up some rando for a bit and then we chased you off. 
---
this thread pretty much sums up the differences in bethesta's fallout against interplay's fallout
---
it's broken - I've started the game and have already complet all but Mirelurk Queen. Killed 3 queens, no challenge complete. I really don't know how lame developers you must be to fuck up so many thing - added few things, made fixes but broke many things altogether (adrenal mutation, challenges).
---
For now all i can think of as part of the cause is a nuke launch, because thats when i started experiencing long load times and glitches until i realize im alone in the server. 
---
As for end game, yeah SBQ. Though others continue on making their own end game by helping new players, setting up trade shops or griefing and pvp. For me unless my friends are on i don't play anymore , it just got old too quick, the endless grind to grind only so you can do a chore. I used to have a long friends list now i only see less than 5 ever on, most of them have moved on to something  else.So unless they do come out with private servers or a PVE only mode where my friends would come back and play. I probably wouldn't be touching this game for a long while.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve started bulking everything I plan to sell first, then stashing before my vendor tour. 
---
He always looks that way 
---
You prove all of our points every time you insinuate yourself as the defender of dupers.  Nobody wants them to be defended, and your guilty conscience can let the topic go.  If you're willing to let it go... if you're willing to see yourself as not-guilty.
---
&gt;And who exactly power attacks in PVP?
---
...are you serious? it's the best way to deal with sentinels.
---
&gt;It's a VATS fest in there.
---
not when you're using your AP for something else.
---
&gt;Did you even read my post? I use Unyielding.
---
then it's even worse because you want bloodied, not troubleshooter or anti-armor.
---
&gt;My Sledge is a God Roll for silos.
---
I won't argue because that's subjective. but I'll say that I have a similar build and I can do the same, except more efficiently, without troubleshooter. there are better prefixes.
---
&gt;As for the Gauss, sure it's not the best but imo it was a decent roll. 
---
decent is not godly. I was talking about god rolls, not decent rolls.
---
&gt;what's the point of VATS when you meet someone running Cham armor or Stealth Boys?
---
depends on how you use it. which is why I implied there were varying god mods. but definitely better than the ones you listed.
---
&gt;And + agi? Again, Unyielding fixes that problem.
---
you can never have too much AP for dodgy.
---
&gt;The more you talk the lower my opinion of you is.
---
you'll probably just dismiss it as a persona insult, like the ones you're throwing around, but you don't much about pvp.
---
&gt;+ stats is NEVER better due to the existence of Unyielding.
---
what if you're not using unyielding, though? regardless, +special is better than reduced weight except in very specific cases.
---
&gt;So, yes, your comment is invalid.
---
still no, not really.
---
Lol you‚Äôre an idiot, computer science is one of the top fields you can get into, and one of the easiest to find a job in. I have already interviewed with several companies, of which are just waiting for my degree to be completed before they give me a job offer. I‚Äôm sorry a moron such as yourself doesn‚Äôt have the brains for it. Just because you chose a bad field to go into and got a shitty whatever from some crap trade school doesn‚Äôt mean other people going to highly coveted institutions won‚Äôt succeed. And 21 with a wife and kid? Damn sounds like a mid life divorce and regret waiting to happen, did you marry the first decent looking bumpkin you saw I mean Christ. 
---
And no I‚Äôm not completely bored with the game, it has gone a bit stale yes. But this post wasn‚Äôt even about that, you‚Äôre just trying to make it about that. This post is about a bug that just caused me to have to clear 10 of my 11 mutations and then re apply them all to fix. Something that you will find out in about 40-50 levels, when you actually start scratching the surface of endgame, which you are not even close to.
---
Lol - I had the same problem yesterday after accidently damaging some guys camp.  5 people in WS and not one of them would take me out XD
---
TSE got nerfed so hard it basically sucks now. What's the point in ruining build diversity like that.
---
Beth cant do balance. None of their SP games have ever been balanced and they brought all these issues to an MP "sandbox".
---
Workshops:
---
Revert Acid Extractor values to their original values, since you now need acid to smelt. Almost impossible to keep up on acid.
---
Change Junk Extractors to only collect rare junk, and not materials that you already get from other extractors.
---
Reduce size of the very large workshops such as the airfield. It is way too large to be practical, especially when defending.
---
well appropriated is a better word, I just couldn't think about it at the time.
---
I am sorry about your condition.
---
 I am distressed that my claim that cheating is a black and white issue, is downvoted. It does explain a lot though.
---
Their games have never been properly balanced. Dont expect miracles.
---
I did the clean mutations and regain 'em. It did work at the time. Few hours later I look at it and it's back...
---
‚ÄúCan we install mods‚Äù you already know the answer hence the ‚Äúwill the game get better?‚Äù
---
Terrible shitpost.
---
Yep. Or just trash it like a real man
---
And yes, picked up a TSE. Yeah my market place post for the jet pack, definitely pod caps for that, and I‚Äôve sold stuff.
---
You can believe whatever you want. See you in game.
---
If you get out of your power armor, and then get back in, the armor you were wearing will have the marks. You may have to view them in your inventory while you're out of the armor, I haven't checked that. Interestingly that may be a UI bug, but it works.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure none of those cryptids want to see what‚Äôs down there...
---
I play a sneak bloodied rifleman.  Full set of Bolstering armor with weapon weight reduction in every piece.  My resistance is around 500.
---
I wish these cool beds were bigger. I use that bed with blue sheets and would never revert to a kid size bed,no matter what graphic it has on.
---
I use named power armor and have no space for the statue or billboard.
---
So wow the only thing i could care for is the overpriced poster.
---
That's why i'm sitting on 11k earned atoms.
---
ts has been nerfed ages ago
---
Oh no I got it, was trying to go alone with it but math and humor don‚Äôt mix. Such a failure ;(
---
I don't know the answer... 
---
Publicly shame? You mean orbital strike their camp then kill them repeatedly?
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt owe you an explanation even if you feel entitled to one.
---
Doesn't this also apply to your "If they can‚Äôt provide the product you want, why do you like them?"
---
Dunno how their script is running so don't have that answer
---
Why does  carnivore / herbivore  prevent you from learning other mutations?
---
That's not good.
---
Melee has been better than ranged for my entire play experience until I got a TSE. Now it's back to melee again.
---
Having to close is only a real issue with scorch beasts and .50 cal toting handies
---
Right, and the way it is now is set for spray and pray, and then spray some more
---
800 atoms is not nothing to earn, maybe if your level 2,  at high levels might as well buy them is my experience or go plant a tree outside and watch it grow, that‚Äôd probably progress faster.
---
U just got whooped by a strong build 
---
Interesting.  I‚Äôll have to try that. But also interestingly, that works opposite another bug, related to exiting the Excavator armor...  shhhh.  I hope they don‚Äôt fix that one.  
---
I know it was nerfed a while back. I‚Äôm talking about with this latest update. Yesterday it did waaaaaay more damage that it does today. 
---
Pretty sure english is their second language. You're wasting your time.
---
PA means squat in pvp. and I'm pretty such underarmor doesn't apply inside PA.
---
You're welcome. Gamertag is cspinasdf. March can't come soon enough.
---
I don‚Äôt know, I think it‚Äôs how they are neither meat nor vegetables
---
adrenal reaction is busted so there's that.
---
makes no sense
---
Thank you for this!  Wish I hadn't scrapped my entire camp.  I was due for a remodel anyway.
---
I wrote a guide thru flatwoods. You can read it here. I missed a few aid kits so theres 3 or 4 not in this run down if you look carefully

I already admitted even in my ticket to Bethesda that I've picked up bags all over Fallout but nothing to weigh me down like 100,000 of anything or anywhere close... just random stuff.   
---
I literally have one piece of armor that is 1 star and the rest I made, even my weapons are lame, 1 star 10mm robots, and a 1 star quad capacity shotgun and the all rise you get through the quest.   
---
So I am banned and said I would like to at least know what I did. if I picked up bad stuff ok then but no where near 100k of anything especially since I haven't been on that much sine Christmas.   
---
Guess when tickets get looked at which I don't think anyone who has been banned yet has, we'll find out. 
---
Would that impact me if I don‚Äôt have that mutation?
---
thats irrelvant. his point was correct; not your paraphrasing in OP
---
Thank you. I've been avoiding one or the other because I was worried I'd have trouble.
---
Also I've been frequently getting legendary ghouls that become unlootable because once I kill them.  Their whole body goes into a weird glitchy spasm where I can't interact with the body at all. Eventually it stops, but even then you can't see the loot container and often the body is still standing or floating. 
---
If you‚Äôre Xbox I can make you some.
---
As a regular csgo player, Usually I'd concede to that stuff but if I've got a build centred around defence and i'm wearing a hulking suit of armour whilst they're not. It makes the entire thing pretty pointless. 
---
2 whole layers of armour, lining and a massive level difference yet I get "whooped" by a strong build in one shot from vats
---
Doesn't sound like working system to me
---
If you're at the stage where you can launch your own nuke, you want to shoot for about halfway between Hemlock Holes workshop and the water park.  I've pulled close to 200 in a session, gave this advice to others and they've confirmed they can get close to 250 raw violet flux in that zone from one nuke.  There will be next to no enemies attacking as you gather flux.
---
Warning though - get your other materials from another nuke zone first.  Do the golf course a couple times and collect the high radiation fluids, glowing mass, and hardened mass before you collect the flux because those things don't deteriorate and the flux does.  One each of all three of those for every 10 raw flux to get 1 stable flux, so if you need 6 stable, get 6 each of the masses and fluids and then get 60 raw violet flux and head to a chemistry bench.  You don't need to buy any plans first to craft the stable flux.
---
Hope this helps!
---
That sounds like a bad idea because atom shop loads in immediately for me almost all the time but servers can still he shit 
---
Kinda slutty but okay
---
Same. Killed 2 sloths, a scorchbeast and a mothman and nothing. 
---
Complete an event didnt trigger for me either. 
---
I'm 43 and my mom still calls to make sure I'm wearing clean underwear.

I tell her "I'm in game right now, mom. It's JUST NOT AVAILABLE, yet."

No I think you need help
---
My Fallout character is amazing BTW.  He plays like EVERY instrument he runs across- with no lessons.
---
Damn that would hurt!  you're right about the punishment though 
---
It took me 7 calls, 4 tech visits for Comcast to realize the issue was not on my end.
---
The last 4 calls were to T2.
---
Flat out, I could tell you after the first tech, that it was not on our end.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I understand what you‚Äôre saying but there‚Äôs only one prime, the other fissure sites don‚Äôt spawn the queen. 
---
Because a good bug isnt ever reported
---
So what is the point in PVP if functions of the game don't work during it? 
---
If you like workshop PVP so much want to do it with friends on sunday PS4?
---
I'm out of atom points and they are getting scarcer...  if I were to take advantage of the limited offer I would've had to purchase atoms, there is no way I would be able to grind 800 atoms in the window given...
---
underarmor works in PA except iirc the excavator could be bugged
---
That might count as breaking rule #9
---
Lol, you might be waiting a while for beth to send you a free serum

Disclaimer:

Subject to the same RNG randomness that results in 12 nocturnal armor pieces in a row and other freak streaks... ;)
---
I had no problems today at all! Nuke and everything on my server!
---
I beg to differ. If you have a perk that enables you to swing a weapon faster, it isn't outlandish that it would allow you to crank the Gatling Gun's unique crank faster as well. It makes perfect sense to me, especially considering that the Gatling Gun is horribly sub par without it. They didn't adjust a bug to make it work as intended, they nerfed the perk that could make this sub par weapon viable. 
---
Bwahaha I am a but of an anomaly sometimes. The bottle cap would be perfect. If anything the plans could maybe be a builder‚Äôs icon, (also not me but) just throwing it out there.
---
So they sold consumables ? Which enhanced stats . When Fo76 said that micro transactions would be strictly cosmetic.  You see the issue here don't you. What is stopping them from making more of these limited enchantments. 
---
lmao no
---
Shit
---
We suck
---
Uhhhh new plan. Just dance and everyone will forget what they heard
---
yea hopefully they fix it soon kind of a bummer. Every time I go back to play its something new lol.
---
I don't know? did you have adrenal reaction prior to the patch?
---
beause if you did, and you were consistently low on health to trigger it, your damage is obviously gonna be lower.
---
Did you pick it up? I wouldn't have knowing it's an 'illegal' item. I doubt a human reviews every single case there would be too many so you would get the same email everyone else got, You aquired more than 100k blah blah in 30 days.
---
Again I don't know their script unless they are so kind as to show it to me I can only assume based off what knowlage I have of the process and volumes of traffic provided by the community.
---
Bug or feature, nobody knows. Maybe the game was just rigged from the start 
---
If this happened to you, how did you contact them that you actually got a reply? I only opened 1 ticket months ago when my mutations weren't working and it sat there open without action ever since..
---
At the very least asking could help clarify if Bethesda simply made a mistake and the player base is tearing each other a new one over them casting their net too wide..
---
Rad worms buffed everything last patch
---
[removed]
---
I mean, new patches have a tendency to create new bugs but this game is ridiculous with the amount of new bugs with every patch...
---
rad worms bug pretty much buffed everything by 50%
---
Its the 3rd Weekly in 4 weeks to be broken. Dont be surprised if they think they fixed it internally and repeat it next week and its still broken.
---
There's a perk that eliminates 75% of all armor and combine that with a strong weapon and other melee perks and even ultracite will seem like childsplay
---
Can you pay real world money to get an in game advantage? 
---
The items were technically pay to win for a limited time no matter how you look at it. Did they actually make you "win" at the game - no. It gave a minor boost for a limited time to what is effectively a PvE game. I don't think the bonus itself was that big of a deal, but trying to argue it wasn't pay to win is silly. Arguing it's not that big of a deal makes a lot more sense imo
---
I think the only reason it should be concerning is if they take this same concept and use it in future atomic shop content 
---

I always keep my toilet so clean you can eat out of it, never know when someone might stop by for dinner.

There seems to be a lot of speculation there as well. I'm not defending anyone, but a number of people in those comments back up at least some of what the guy has done as legit. All I'm saying is, if the guy _is_ innocent, what would that look like and what should he do about it?
---
You shouldnt have been duping them

Can you guys please fix the quest ‚Äúkill unruly golfer feral ghouls‚Äù 
---
Ive had the game since beta and i still havent even been able to kill or find one! And i spend quite some time there! 
---
Feeling kind of disappointed to not be banned.
---
Logged in, killed some scorched, ran out of ammo, and ran out of fun.
---
Practical usage! Perfect üëåüëçüòä
---
the dude that called me a liar is the OP and nothing about this post leads me to believe English is their second language...
---
Can second this. Everytime I login I go to kill the Behemoth in the pond near The Vantage and everytime the body disappears instantly I see that there is a new body (which oddly I can't interact with at all) in the pond. I'm on PS4 if it helps.
---
END has other uses too.  So its not a total waste.  Useless is people that refuse to think outside the box and try to mix/max certain things only to go down in one hit cause you couldn't survive or resist a certain attack.
---
Because when you get out of the PA it reequips everything as you get out that's why there's a bit of a delay getting out 
---
I know. I think it‚Äôs because as a consumable serums just don‚Äôt fit in either category, so their effects are not taken into account
---
I have that same sword and it doesn‚Äôt do that. Unless I don‚Äôt have the proper perks equipped. I‚Äôm still pretty new to the game. 
---
try the search bar, a fix was posted several times
---
Atom shop barely ever loads for me. My connection seems fine for other games, but for some reason it doesn't like fallout.
---
I cycle the router, clear the DNS, nada.
---
Every so often it still takes 10 minutes to load a server.
---
Two words. Space management. If you bulked up all the scrap you could you literally can save tons of room in your stash. It's one of the main reasons I kept my stash from ever reaching the 600 limit.
---
I get 2.5k with max adrenaline and a bloody MMG. There's mutations and other perk cards involved but I feel like adrenaline does most of the work
---
You damn well better have the good with salt perk and carnivore mutation too
---
I don't think anyone can confirm, no. but you're right, people say aa and even furious don't work with explosive.
---
I haphazardly "tested" it and, in my experience, it's kinda like speed demon, that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
---
I was excited for the PVP servers tbh but if this is the bar then my excitement has hit Jupiter levels of gravity
---
Ok, cool, I think I misunderstood what you were saying, namely that you had people actively hunting you down across the map to take your workshop. You can actually do, effectively anyway, by just not contesting when someone comes to take your shop. Just leave the area and they'll get it without bloody murder. I know there are those that'll do it for the kill, but they didn't want the anyway. The best way to deal with them is just let the kill you and dont resist. They're doing it to get a rise out of you.
---
Good bugs are called exploits
---
Making caps is one thing, and it's ridiculously easy to do without cheating, without effort. I've met one person that does what you're saying, trying to make real money in any way possible, by streaming, by duping.. and not even just with this game, that's how they are in general.
---
Even though I know that person exists that isn't reason to assume that all dupers are like that, or that anyone who has more free time/no life defaults to that either.
---
People are making hella assumptions about everyone else, all based on a whole lot of nothing.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about
---
900 hours is spread across the total 90 days give or take. This is supposed to have been crafted and done within just 30 to 31 days if I am understanding it all. 
---
I have a lvl 40 bloodied deathclaw that deals typically 800-1200 damage (up to about 1800). 
---
You may be able to block/counter attack? (Works vs super mutants, but I have not tried it in pvp)
---
You've edited and changed the tone of every single reply you've made to me.  You were buying from a duper 6 days ago.   So you're lying directly to me and changing the way it looks after the fact.  I think I'll leave you blocked in game, m8.  *I hope you have fun in game* *blush*  *I had a lot of fun!*  These are all bullshit things you added after the fact.  Why be like that?  No more time wasted on you.  Take care and I hope you get better. :)
---
Wow
---
Other than adrenal reaction not working, it seems great. 
---
With a Bloodied weapon, a set of Unyielding legendary armor, the Nerd Rage! perk, and the (currently bugged to not work) Adrenal Reaction mutation, alongside consumables/other legendary effects to boost melee damage and STR, a low-health melee build can deal damage in the thousands. Don't forget Incisor, too, which will ignore 75% of your Power Armor, as if it mattered at that point. 
---
I assure you, I have no idea what incredibly convenient and useful bug you are talking about.  
---
I switched to X01 armor a while ago though, and learned to manage my hoarding instincts. Yellow's just not my color.
---
Seriously. This.
---
But it's hard to actually actively farm it. There's the two schools and you're out.
---
Recently someone discovered that the meat hook is prolly bugged and it counts as both one-handed and unarmed perk cards so bloodied meat hooks with the right mutations are getting over 3000 dmg with it. Big yikes.
---
Jesus, You'd think they'd give PA a bit of a buff to actually make it feel like it looks. Or at least make it so PA can't be circumvented with perks
---
That sounds bad, do you have an ethernet cord or is it wireless because that may be a partial reason 
---
Well, one big thing though is he was actually not banned during the big ban wave. He got banned before that happened and tried to play it off as if he got caught up in the whole ban wave. 
---
But it's only unbalanced...if it's unbalanced. If the chains and metal bits are mirror symmetric at every cross section, that stuff just adds weight. Assumedly, you'd have a robust enough bearing to not impose a shear force on the drive shaft.
---
Now for the weight, if you decrease the angular velocity (attack speed) such that angular momentum is conserved, the motor strain wouldn't increase either. Now, I don't know if the increased moment arm from the spiky bits that poke out would force you to reduce your velocity to nearly zero. Hard to determine that particular design constraint in this theoretical scenario.
---
I'd be HAPPY to reacquire Adrenal Reaction to test if there were an easy way to lose JUST Adrenal Reaction and then re-acquire it. But there isn't without losing ALL other mutations. 
---
Please $%^@ING fix this, Bethesda. 
---
I'm not seeing alot of people's tickets looked at, or rather thats posting the replies everywhere. The 900 hour guy got his looked at, but then again his posts became rather popular too so that might have helped.
---
Eh I think there are very small amounts of space savings, there's reddit topics on how a lot of that was misinformation. I'll admit, I never had the need to bulk that much, I keep only what I need.
---
Shouldn't the list of what you need to kill update every time you kill one of them?  Also, if you need to kill five, shouldn't it start with a (0/5) and work its way up?  I'm pretty sure you didn't read the actual post (or even the title) and are just talking about what *last week's* challenges were.
---
There is no way to repair damaged camp items that aren't destroyed unless you store and place them. There is zero chance you've "tested it"
---
Maybe... 
---
I would definitely like it if they made PA automatically nerf armor piercing. But not by a lot because I kinda like my bootleg antimaterial hunting rifle 
---
it is. in a nutshell, melee is op and whales who can afford legendary armor are essentially invincible.
---
PA and DResistance in general are useless. incisor, tank killer and even stabilized + anti-armor will eat through it like it's made out of butter.
---
The idea is to stagger which causes the sentinel part of sentinel/assassin to stop working for a moment.  
---
This then makes them open to damage so basically pain train -&gt; head shot crit or just melee hulk smash.
---
Yes. That is what they're saying. Does it suck? Yes. 
---
I‚Äôve also been falsely flagged unfortunately. No explanation from support. I think there may be an issue with their detection system because ‚Äúrare‚Äù items shouldn‚Äôt be junk and annoying which is what I acquire tons of on a daily basis. I think I‚Äôve got less than 20 items that could be considered rare between guns and some armor. üò™
---
It may be the best time ever to jump in.  Bugs and stability is the best yet. But it still has a bit to go. The lack of endgame content was amplified by the awfully massive amount of exp that the game gave out early on. IMO, if you like the fallout world and pace yourself, there is a ton of fun stuff to do. I think this environment is their most fun one to explore yet. If taking time to read notes and terminals isn‚Äôt your thing, then you may be disappointed by the story. This is more prominent than in other fallouts. It‚Äôs sometime a little frustrating that there are no human npc‚Äôs around, but it works with the story so I can deal with it. It‚Äôs not fallout 5, but I‚Äôm having fun. 
---
On PC, thank you though man
---
We don't need patches, we need better PVP, a better game
---
Wow, What an absolute shit show of a system. They've made TSE weapons useless and power armour. They might aswell just make bullets do +1 dmg at this rate
---
Okay I'll check it out
---
That's right. Good bugs get you banned.
---
Second time now an update has completely nerfed my build to shit. I'm ready to give up on this game.
---
Mindless moron
---
I get your point,  but what evidence are you referring to?
---
Then you jump servers and both are available again. 
---
Non-Issue.
---
I suspect Guerilla should be applied to both Automatic Pistols and Submachine guns (10mm and .45). Instead, it sounds like it applied to neither (Sub guns get bonus from Commando).   
---
I just want the perk (Chef/Expert Chef/Master Chef) that makes my rolling pin uber-powerful...
---
This fix mentioned by Bethesda worked, but only for a minute.  Now it's back to normal and when I equip Strange In Numbers, for some reason my damage now drops LOWER! This NEEDS a hotfix.
---
Yeah yeah, heard it all before. Once you start doing it long term there's no reason to keep playing then. You're only doing it for money that's the only eventual possibility to dupe VAST amounts of items. If you duped just to dupe then you're a fucking idiot
---
When did I say I cheat? 
---
I can imagine in PVP according to people here it may get a debuff of some sort. But even if I would've thought power armour would be able to handle melee weapons better than armour piecing rounds
---
When you are ready, the Mire will welcome you.
---
Including me. But what do I know. 
---
To my credit I only thanked him for his quest and wished him luck
---
I apologize if this is common knowledge I‚Äôm unaware of or I‚Äôm just out of the loop, but I thought Bethesda was banning folks who used mods on F76?
---
I feel like there‚Äôs probably some good ones out there, but I‚Äôm paranoid to try them out
---
Im not the one with 12 duped stimpaks missing 
---
It just works
---
Bethesda Support is telling people in reply‚Äôs on Twitter to reply to email ban letter... problem is the email address is literally ‚Äúno_reply@....‚Äù so that‚Äôs set up as an outgoing email no one monitors. I sent a reply anyways and of course haven‚Äôt heard anything. 
---
My ticket has been in since Saturday... still says waiting on agent. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone post anything about their ticket even being looked at. 
---
If they are banned the priority is low at best. 
---
Concern trolling and straw man. You are pulling out everything here.
---
That would be a cool mechanic for the developers to consider. Next patch could implement something to address the issue 
---
Xbox, im here looking at sbq meatpile for 40 minutes now waiting my loot, wtf??????
---
yeah, I get you, You've gotten used to how it works now and it would be really annoying if they debuffed your gear. I think they should've maybe tested the system alot more before just throwing it out
---
I found the marine helmet plan just legit lying around somewhere...
---
Lol I‚Äôm used to non-stop wood legs so how much worse can it be 
---
I defended players, not dupers. Again players =/= dupers by default, and you making assumptions about me when I'm talking about legitimate players (you know, the thousands of people who have played before/since/after day 1). They do exist, people who don't cheat.
---
I'm thinking that a lot of the people throwing the accusations at anyone else is really just projecting. Are you a cheater? If you're going around looking for places to comment about how anyone who isn't condemning dupers must be one, maybe that's *your guilty conscience*.
---
I hope to come back to this game I've day if Bethesda hasn't destroyed the community completely by then, with the help of players like you that is.
---
Level doesn't mean anything.  The people with the best gear get it through trading.  I see a bunch of people now looking for Lvl &lt;10 gear, no doubt just to troll people.  I had someone take my workshop the other day in full assassin's sentintial gear and I couldn't do squat about it.  Typically a good PvP game involves counterplay and unfortunately the only counterplay is to get on reddit and trade for the exact same gear and weapons.   The in-game progression is ungodly slow, you'd have to grind Whitesprings for 100's of hours to get decent gear you could just buy for a few 1000 caps.  Hopefully balance changes and in-game trading will at least give average players a fighting chance.  But Bethesda has no shortage of things to fix and everyone gets butthurt if they even mention PvP in a multiplayer game.

If you can‚Äôt see the people your words hit. I submit there‚Äôs a problem with you.

Tyvm for the responses!

Not to mention his guide was done before the big ban wave hit that he claimed to get caught in.  he even stated himself that he wrote the guide after being banned because he got time to do it when he could not get on. 
---
Have you ever fought a SBQ, only to fail and be out of stimpaks &amp; ammo, while overencumbered limping yourself back to watoga station while enduring a barrage of multiple scorchbeast non-stop sonic attacks? That‚Äôs living.
---
If people want to find the codes themselves, they can ignore this post and do so
---
Ok, thank you for the info! I'm not nuking yet, so I'll have to coattail it. I will work on collecting the proper amounts of fluids/mass needed first. I didn't think it would be as difficult as it seems.
---
I've literally watched my stash dropped a good 20 to 40 from bulking without counting the plastic used in bulking. I think I know how much in saving when I've been doing this since beta. If you collect mass amounts of junk and save or call up for crafting, modding, and repairs you notice these little things.
---
No because it‚Äôs a rhetorical question
---
Didn't know that. I might've spoke too fast
---
And then you murder it!
---
That's pretty nice and fitting.
---
Could you elaborate further on what you're on about?
---
The risk vs reward was so unbalanced, how was this fun? It would cost 10 stimpaks to obtain a scorchbeast wing fragment and some meat.
---
How so? How can you tell?
---
We get it you're a troll, it doesn't make you funny.
---
thx bruh i will check tonight when i log in
---
Some clothing types go UNDER any pieces of armour, they unequip your underarmour.  The other clothing types go OVER armour pieces and are effectively costumes and won‚Äôt unequip the underarmour.
---
Well, I‚Äôm just glad it -can- work again. It could be worse!
---
I don't know what you want me to say, I'm not trolling, I've made it clear I think there are def legit bans, but in this particular case, using the data at hand, I have come to the conclusion that there are most likely more than a few false bans...  Bethesda themselves said they have no way to track what items are dupes...  factor in the aging engine and every other fuck up up to this point and yeah, I am inclined to believe Bethesda fucked up, at the very least the situation was handled poorly...
---
As a Kentuckian from a town that borders your state; I am disappointed in your leaving out of Hillbilly (Hillfolk) Hotdogs.
---
PA has some advantages, especially in the early/mid game, but it's probably balanced to allow non-PA builds to be viable late in the game. 
---
Unarmed melee has its advantages, but there are disadvantage as well, the same with PA-builds.
---
Or, you know, play the game. It's not like ballistic fibre. Much like real life, plastic junk is pretty common everywhere.
---
I do it to lure you guys into pvp tbh. It spices things up. The xp and drops are meaningless.
---
there's definitely something wrong with the fact that objectivity is now seen as a bad thing.
---
they have a job. I couldn't care less about their feelings. people shouldn't get a pass because someone is being mean on the internet, especially when things are this bad.
---
You should make a web site that does that.  It would sell like hot cakes.
---
Word , not gunna lie I‚Äôve done my fair share of duper hunting , but I‚Äôve never taken a bag full of 100,000 rare items or picked up any bags at all , all I‚Äôve done is just blow their shit up and be a nuisance and send pictures of their inventory to Bethesda , the classy way üòõ
---
I know it's fun to rag on people that got banned for legit duping and then claiming innocence, but it's also kind of a dick move to be mocking the ones who may have indeed been accidentally banned. If I spent $60 on this game only to get erroneously banned like three months after launch, I would not be too happy. And let's be real, with this game's track record, you know there was definitely some erroneous bans.
---
That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt even work... just tried to reapply the mutation several times... it won‚Äôt even register the mutation ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Excellent! You find the patch underwhelming and are banned so it won't bother you! And I'm both happy about it and able to enjoy it. This continues to work our splendidly.
---
Not really looking for any other games to get into now though, 76 is all I've got time for and my friends and I are pushing onward, anticipating new content coming soon! You'll likely hate the new content so again being banned should work out great for you there.
---
Have fun!
---
Ahh, thank you!
---
Im sure they are waiting to do it because they want to separate stash items from vending machine items and players are going to treat these vending machines as extra stash boxes by setting stuff to stupidly high prices so that no one buys
---
i was just thinking this and was going to start a discussion about storing caps. griefing has been a bit of an issue and when you get to be higher levels, people target you in hopes of initiating a pvp session to steal your caps. the ability to store your caps somewhere other then your person would partially solve this, but at the same time it would give griefers the ability to kill people, take caps, store caps.
---
One of the train station up north has a ladle in it and soup by it! It's a wild wasteland out there!
---
Loot was 25 ivory pistol plans, seven lvl 35 instigating canes and about 1000 rounds of 10mm ammo
---
The title doesn't match the contents of this post. 
---
Creating a megathread, pinning it and using the body of the post to argue/complain about the content the megathread was designed for as a sub mod is nonsense 
---
As a moderator you take on the responsibility to take on the role impartially. 
---
Community members discussing the game and the impact significant events have had on them is why subreddits like this exist. And most of the banned posts I've seen regardless of the objective validity have adhered to the rules.
---
This isn't an extension of bethesda forums which hasn't seemed to be the case in this sub for a while and frankly this is how you end up on r/subredditdrama 
---
Pretty sure someone was saying stimpaks or some of them if you bought them at vendors may have been duplicated. I‚Äôve seen a few people talk about this.
---
What????
---
In that case, I believe I have a few I could spare for you. Diluted stims if nothing else, but still stims. Won‚Äôt be for another 3-ish hours though, if you ca get on around then. 
---
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer!
---
From what I hear mostly junk, few caps and scrap materials. Sometimes a legendary, sometimes a plan. But mostly junk
---
I killed a Mirelurk Queen , Albino Deathclaw lv 61 , Scorchbeast x 4 , SBQ x1 , still nothing popped .
---
That's funny. I run 4 END and I NEVER lose in PVP. I farm 10k caps a day. I don't blame you for not knowing how to build a character though, not everyone can be smart enough. 
---
The ONLY thing END helps with is HP. That's it. That's all. 
---
Nontangible items aren't protected through Paypal.  People can buy the items, receive them, report the transaction as fraud through their credit card, get there money back, and the seller will pay a $20 charge back fee.  Sounds lucrative.
---
Here is my understanding:
---
Anti-Armor reduces physical DR. Explosions are energy damage.
---
Bloodied/Instigating/Furious/Executioner's buff the weapon base damage AND the explodo. 
---
Anti-Armor works very well on it's own, however, and explosive on per-pellet weapons like Shotguns or Flechette-modded Harpoon Guns is still excellent damage. Explosives aren't great against Scorchbeasts/SBQ in the air, but again, every bit helps.
---
Bloodied builds will out-damage most anything. Anti-Armor is less, but it works "out of the box" and does not (necessarily) require specific gear pieces (or low health) to do what it do - although it will work with a similar build. 
---
If you had adrenal reaction before this patch, the patch bugged out the positive effects. Kinda something you would already know about if you need this fix kinda thing.
---
&gt; Who is going to bother with the Defend events when the moment they enter the Workshop they make it contested?
---
The change doesn't cause people to automatically contest a workshop by entering the workshop area. The change allows people to now simply longpress the same button as entering build mode, while anywhere within the workshop area, to trigger the confirmation dialog for claiming/contesting a workshop. 
---
This analogy does not fill me with comfort, looking at what's happening with Blizzard now. Blizzard is fucking \_evil\_. It's not just a few things, activision/blizzard is one of the companies that, at this point, due to their actions towards their player base and more importantly their employees, I cannot ever give them another dime of my money.   
---
And that's from someone who's logged uncountable hours in the original warcraft games, starcraft, diablo...It was a publisher that I would purchase every title by that company because I knew it was gold, back in the day.   
---
But yeah, there's some disturbing trending in that direction from Bethesda, too. Bethesda has never been a "good company" their track record of spurious lawsuits attests to that, but they aren't...improving. 
---
There are no patch notes yet. 
---
What if you have 30 plans for ultracite vents but no recipe for mutations and you just recently shelled out 3600 caps to buy adrenal reaction from the enclave and now only have 2700 caps?
---
They said no such thing. Support said they can't restore items, and you guys hold that statement up as your battle standard.
---
Then you blame the engine for false bans... what?
---
You are reaching so hard. If you weren't banned, why do you even care? If you were banned, you're just flailing.
---
I'm at work so no I don't know chief. But I should remind you that this is a game. Calm down.
---
Lol
---
Ummm

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asat8r/fallout_76_patch_notes_february_19_2019/
---
I‚Äôm just messin with you, man, you aight
---
Sure. If you're hoarding standard ammo, a few thousand makes sense...even a few tens of thousands.
---
Ultracite ammo does not follow the same argument. 
---
I view the story quests as a tutorial to learn the map and basic game mechanics. Then it is sandlot, I love it!
---
No he didn't. Here's what it is. First, he finds out that he is banned. Then he decided to come up with that farming technique guide in case he needs to explain his mass amount of items. He gets upvotes and support from the community and feels comfortable to reveal that he is actually banned from the game. But it turns out that he was hoarding way way too much ultracite ammo even considering his playtime and farming expertise so people started bombarding him
---
I wish i could, but no, im banned. I picked up a loot bag full of junk items and now im banned. I can not praise the almighty mothman and give him my undying praise. Please...someone make sure to let him know i love him...
---
I'm not challenging you, but could you be more specific about "Still?"  I use a 15 Luck build and had no issues with crit perks last night. Also, I've found bloody mess to be useful on crit builds as well. Your mileage may vary!
---
Yes it‚Äôs intentional, you aren‚Äôt meant to get the buffs of regular armor and power armor at the same time.
---
Logged back in and tried again, only to find the list now incorrectly claims I have killed five different Huge Creatures.  The challenge skill hasn't completed.  This is identical to list errors that occurred in the glitched "pick flowers" challenges in past weeks. 
---
I did at least get the event challenge to trigger via a workshop defending event.
---
Lmao
---
They really need to fix that, kind of shocked they didn't include some of the low hanging fruit fixes in this patch 
---
Thanks for the silver? Never got it before. What do you do with it
---
Wow thanks wont be doing that then. Have to wait for hotfix? 
---
One week later‚Ä¶ ‚Äú800 is NOT ENOUGH!‚Äù
---
I noticed that, my bad
---
I try to defend this game to people but this is another left field idea from an out of touch developer.... and I don‚Äôt even claim that many workshops.... but like , why? It should be a challenge for someone to steal my workshop. I would totally support this idea however in full pvp mode.
---
How many more gigs do you need? 
---
Doesn't the sloths mushroom soup do the same?
---
It actually does...  
---
I made a few thousand blackberry juice and glowing meat steaks a few weeks ago, have done the same with other things, you spend a bit of time doing X so you can avoid doing it later.  
---
Scroll through, I outlined how some of the OP's calculations are off
---
I hope so, I can‚Äôt play this game without it to be effective.
---
I'd just save them for now.  They don't actually weigh anything.  I've saved up around 200 for a full day of treasure hunting.
---
So there is no one that will even attempt to listen to me
---
Nothing increases your camp budget. Your budget is the highest it will be starting at level 1. People saying it goes up with level are incorrect (this has been tested), though it continues to be a common misconception. My level 216 character has the same available budget as my level 50 and my level 4.
---
There have however existed bugs with phantom objects taking up budget, like tamed animals that died and wires from objects that were stored/scrapped. May have been others.
---
I think a high Luck score can factor into it
---
who was initiating the PVP?
---
Sorry to hear about the bug but just some info you can make blight soup for 20% crit buff in the meantime. Travel to Welch station and behind the overseer's old house there is a few blights then a little west of those there are a few more. Should be enough to give you several hours of crit.
---
Obligatory upvote for XKCD reference.
---
Also, apparently Google keyboard automatically recognizes that acronym should be capitalized. :)
---
Dude wasn‚Äôt overly aggressive or anything of that nature lol.
---
Where are you getting the information on the adrenaline reaction mutation is bugged?
---
So.... my friends that have been banned that legitimately have not exploited a duplicate glitch.... when will they be cleared? 
---
Depending on what area you can get rare outfits or power armor plans as well. The best thing to do is swap them to an alt and hit them up for easy exp 
---
Awesome
---
You really need to look into vats rifle crits. Melee isn't the strongest thing in this game. Not by a long shot 
---
I did. Which is why its weird the amount of totals they're telling me that I have. I never once cheated and I am still suspended. If I could make everything I've ever done in fallout 76 public I would. 
---
I thought bloody mess and all weapon specific perk card does not affect Crit amount unless perks that specified increasing Crit amount. Crit amount is based on the base damage I believe. 
---
That's a good way to put it. It gives you things you need to enjoy the other aspect of the game. 
---
What are you even saying? Have you seen his most updated post? He explains why he thinks he was flagged. Which was him transferring ammo to his other account. 
---
Also can you personally prove this alleged timeline of events or are you just assuming someone else said it so it must be true?
---
Also also, people have been doing the math and it is possible to craft the amount of ammo. I don't see why you would do so unless you play way too much but it is possible. 
---
You sure do love to call people stupid for somebody who blindly follows rules and never questions the company who put them in place. Bethesda is trying to shift the blame to people who used exploits that THEY gave them. If they didn‚Äôt want shit like this to happen, oh I dunno, create a new engine for this multiplayer game? No, you‚Äôre going to use the same terrible engine full of exploits and bugs used for singleplayer games? Then you‚Äôre going to be mad at people who do what they‚Äôve always done? Ridiculous, man. C‚Äômon
---
Addressing your edit first...I mean, to be fair, I just think ya'll should have _lost_ your shit, not like gotten banned or something. Seize the ill-gained loot and move on, lesson learned.  I said consequences. Not "The same consequences". There's a distinct advantage for the huge swath of players who have bought duped gear, compared to those of us who have not. Leveling that playing field would be fair. 
---
I honestly am unsure that I believe there's a significant number of people who have gotten traded goods through legitimate in-game encounters. Let's be real here, there's no in game market. In order to hunt for and purchase a specific quality weapon, you have to _leave the game_, find a trading reddit, or discord, or something. If you hang out in any fallout 76 space that isn't the game itself, duper posts are unavoidable. 
---
I mean, I'm sure these dupers do spot trades in random locations, but that's not the vast majority of their transactions. It's other traders, or individuals looking for "just one, so it's ok" on trade forums. 
---
Print it out and show it to your parents thats all its really used for 
---
Lol I know. It's just there taunting us. 
---
The thing is, this game has virtually no challenge for anyone that's played it any amount of time.  Nerfing explosive weapons doesn't make it challenging, it just shifts the meta build, makes the queen fight take longer, most enemies don't die in a single shot.. but it didn't make the game *harder*.
---
That said, I really don't see the point in duping, it doesn't make the game more fun for anyone and there was never any challenge to getting anything in the game. Every material in the game is available even in low level parts of the map with only flux being gated behind nukes.
---
Every single legendary weapon/armor has the same chance dropping from any legendary enemy anywhere, any time. Anyone can get a great weapon/armor they don't want and try to trade towards one they do want.
---
The only unique drops from the queen were serum recipes which you could always buy from the bunker, they were just prohibitively expensive and seldom there.
---
So being honest- why was there ever a reason to cheat? There really isn't one.
---
I would kill for them to be able to release how they gathered that I have that much ammo. Because I did not cheat. Bethesda is just awful. I'm pretty much done.
---
Or talk to it to get those sweet bonuses, you damn monster!
---
That's the shits if true, I am DEFINITELY not a Luck build üòÇ Luck gets in the way of a good super sledge
---
U could just black out all the personal info.
---
So you're agreeing that the only reason to dupe was to make money, right?
---
How the fuck are they getting 2000 damage? I already feel OP with my 3-Star Grognak and it maxes out at 250 for me. 
---
Hopefully they did something to it. Companies do ‚Äòsilent updates‚Äô all the time to address issues that‚Äôs harder to categorize. It was quite apparent that the AI of ghouls at WS was improved after previous patch but they never mentioned it. 
---
Arnt the ones that go under just underarmors
---
That's cute. I farm 10k caps a day in PVP. But yes, by all means claim I know nothing about PVP. Why stop there? Claim I know nothing about Fallout why don't you? You're the one complaining that you never get God Roll stuff, not me. So I'm not sure who knows nothing here, me or you. Lmao. 
---
WITHOUT + stats items I have around 420 AP. And full set of AP Refresh plus a shitload of perks that increases AP refresh, so I regen all 420 AP in 3-4 seconds. I do 1200 dmg with my "useless" build. Up to 2k in certain scenarios. 
---
I have met TWO people that could beat me in 1v1 PVP. Just two. In my months and months of playing.  I go through the rest of them like a hot knife through butter. I've done many 3v1, 4v1 scenarios and won them all. I've made people flee. I've invaded workshops or player bases with 8-10 people there, and I made short work of them. I've hired "merc groups" on FB for hits on myself and won. 
---
Bloodied is COMPLETELY overrated. Completely. I don't need that shit to dominate PVP. 
---
So, try harder to claim I know nothing. 
---
*note, YES all were at least lvl50. Sheer majority was lvl100+, even a couple of 200+. I don't waste my time on anyone below 50.*
---
As for PVE, I can take out 1/3 of SBQ health in -&gt; 20 seconds. I have video proof. And that was with 8+ people there. 
---
Lastly, if you're so good at the game and you're on XB1 feel free to drop by. We'll see who the noob is here. 
---
Why mole rats and rad scorpions? Can they detect stealthed players?
---
No pitchfork sharpening just observing that it is the same mentality in looking online for the decrypted code as going to a duper to get gear.
---
From the looks of the downvotes people are against doing the actual work and earning it themselves. Which will, imo, lead to Beth making it even harder at some point. 
---
There is like 4 different items that can give you +20% crit damage, and in case you are wondering, no they dont stack lol
---
So, are you automatically flagged for PvP if you accidentally walk into the workshop's build zone, or do you have to trigger it (like pressing E and confirming you want to claim like it used to be)?
---
"Person said bad thing about something I like, I must complain on Reddit to strangers" dude, go outside.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but it was 15 per person in the team and it was only temporary for that week.
---
awesome story...lately WS nuke zones have been completely dead..i barely see anyone there..also i noticed ppl started nuking harpers ferry..there was a few glowing ones and i think i got some violet flux..but dont see any real benefit to why
---
I quite literally could not read his post at the time I asked that because it had been removed.
---
Crafting over 100k .50 ammo is a horrible example to work off of because it's one of the few ammo types that crafts in that kind of bulk.  A single .50 craft provides at MINIMUM 100 rounds before even factoring in perks.  Factoring in Ammosmith and Super Duper and you would take on average only about 350 crafts to hit 100k rounds.
---
Compare that to crafting a less bulky ammo like 5.56 that normally crafts in batches of 20 and factoring in the perks you're looking at over 1200 crafts just to hit 100k ammo.
---
But this guy isn't accuses of crafting 100k rounds, he's been accused of producing almost four times as much.
---
He didn't have over 300k of it. He has a few thousand Nd the way Bethesda tracker works ot counts the amount added to your inventory. 
---
Aka pick up and drop 1k worth of ammo 10 times, and it will count as if 10k worth if ammo has passed hour inventory. We know this is how it works because bethseda themselves have said it  and modders from FO3/NV/4 have mentioned it. 
---
They did, so I responded, tried seeking revenge and every time he‚Äôd just use vats to one shot me. I rarely engage in PVP since the whole slap mechanic automatically puts the person who attacks second at a disadvantage. 
---
Zones maybe would‚Äôve been a better way to go I think 
---
This would be good, problem is dupers would love this, and Bethesda would still have to penalize wanted people that store their caps, since their are griefers with huge bounties and no caps to lose when they die. They could also fix it were you don't lose caps based off your lvl in pvp/workshops because losing 100-200 caps vs a lvl 50 losing 50 is just dumb. Imagine someone reaching lvl 1k+ they would lose a days worth of vendor caps dying in pvp.
---
I literally just made a post on this go to my post history and check out everyone defending him
---
Confirming that acquiring the adrenal mutation does not work. I‚Äôve removed every mutation trying to get this one off (of course it was last). I acquired it again three times. It went as follows: Sixth mutation gained: only negative effects. Thirteenth mutation gained: only negative effects. My last attempt I got it first and it was still just the negative effects showing. This mutation is completely screwed after this patch.
---
Another round of patches and still no notes on fixing the Fallout Forever trophy for PS4. Still not playing until it's fixed.
---
Isn't that event long over?
---
If you don‚Äôt engage them back then they can‚Äôt steal your caps tho.. also with the survival mode coming out I don‚Äôt think there will be as many people trying to initiate PvP on PvE servers.
---
Still cant craft Confederate hat or witch hat though 
---
It's all good :-)
---
My first reaction when someone corrects me is that I must be wrong.  I half expected you to read that link and go *"That's for last week's patch, dummy!"* and I'd slap my forehead.
---
You should never pvp in power armor its crap
---
Oh well that's    cool. I bought one from a raider vendor at a train station. I remember that much.
---
That video came out when the outfits did...and the reality is, during that week, bethesda WAS in violation of a promise made. They stated they would not provide players who purchased atom shop goods with an advantage...and yet, that weekly "perk" only worked if everyone was wearing \_separate\_ outfits.  Your opinion as to the quality of improvement doesn't matter.   
---
Ya'll need to stop being fanboys. Bethesda fucked up, the youtubers are sometimes horribly wrong, but generally speaking most of them, especially the ones who've been doing content for years and aren't just trying to do quick cash grabs with promotions? They're pointing out issues with the game.   
---
This was a legitimate fucking issue. Bethesda needs to \_not\_ do that shit. 
---
What dark magic is that lol.
---
You're running into an issue that's common in many MMOs: damage is balanced around PvE, not PvP. Against the large health pools of npcs, doing 400 damage is what you want. It's fun to one shot npcs and that kind of damage is necessary against the huge health pool for the queen. However, against another player, who has 300ish health, and their armor is largely ignored, that's a one shot death. 
---
Some games just reduce damage across the board. Some have PvP specific stats. I don't know the right answer here, but it should probably not ever be one hit kills. That's not PvP.
---
thx - this dude seemed cocky
---
I can!  I crafted one earlier to test :-)
---
Sure. I mean, I could get a piece of paper and do the keyword cipher, but after the first three weeks I'd rather just save myself the 15 minutes and let the computer do it.
---
I'm not sure if that's the same mentality as duping, but it's how I feel.
---
I guarantee you this is what has occurred in my situation. Dropping stuff on the ground was mostly how I traded it to my mules. Only really used the trade window to trade weapons/armor.
---
I got the plans to make a Prime receiver and spent a week farming Ultracite and the stable flux I need to mass produce the ammo before I crafted the Prime Receiver. After I finished farming all that and making the ammo with maxed Ammosmith and Super Duper, I had 36,000 rounds of Ultracite 5.56mm. I didn't want to ever run into a situation where my main weapon was out of ammo since it can't be found as a drop and has to be crafted. 10s of thousands of rounds of ammo is easily doable if you set your mind to the task and you're used to grinding and farming in games. I am really glad, but disappointedly surprised that I wasn't banned just because I had stockpiled and farmed a lot of ammo.
---
With ammo at such low weight, especially with maxed Bandolier, why would they never expect us to not stockpile our ammo?
---
Storing caps would reduce the penalties for griefers. 
---
Ty for a very helpful reply...and yes you‚Äôre both quite right...trouble is I homestead in toxic valley, and the ingredients are always at hand, even know how to get 4 sugars in less than 5 minutes with a quick walk around.
---
Trouble is this isn‚Äôt the only recipe, just the one I would use the most...can‚Äôt make Feverblossom, strangler bloom....anyhoo at least 1/2 of the steeped recipes I‚Äôve learned have the ‚Äúnot enough materials‚Äù bug.  Was really hoping that was over with.
---
Don't think people who actually play gave an f about the bonus. He makes some quality videos but this time, it seems that he was just trying to make some publicity out of the game's in game store. I get that, but I honestly think he should have waited until some actual pay to win items started popping up
---
What?
---
Then mine is either bugged or Bugthesda removed several learned plans from my character's memory
---
That is why glitches/exploits = game breaking buffs lol.
---
I upvoted you. I never cheated/duped/picked up duped shit(never lucky enough to see any and i have +900 hours too). I am enjoying all of these bans, clean the game of this trash. take their money and don't give it back Bethesda!
---
sorry, they [implied](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019) they have no way to track how or when a player acquired an item
---
&gt; These actions were highly-focused toward a list of over 400 weapon and armor items we identified as common duplication targets. 
---
if they knew exactly what was duped they wouldn't have such a broad target.  I blame the engine for a lot but in this case the engine is why they can't track how or when a player acquired an item...
---
further they said this in that post:
---
&gt; **Finally, during our investigation leading up to these actions, we  determined that less than 1% of all Fallout 76 accounts combined across  all three platforms needed to have duped items removed. This means the  vast majority of players did not possess multiple copies of these¬†duped  items, and have had zero items removed from their characters today.** 
---
the amount of claims of false bans can't be far from 1% of the player base...  that would mean all the claims are liars, and the math just doesn't add up there...
---
I looked on the patch notes hub and it didn't show up so I assumed it didn't exist
---
Oh would you look at that, Fallout 76 is still full price on Bethesda's official store front... You'd think being their official storefront and all it would be the first sign of the shift to lower costs officially, or a free to play shift... It's almost like this store ordered more stock then they actually needed and needs to make room for new, better selling games...
---
LO. It does cost me anything. I take no damage from the screeching. Its explosive, and Heavy Combat with Dense is pretty well immune. I can literally put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and take no damage whatsoever. 
---
 My game is hunting them and I am prepared. I put Lever Action .45s into em'. I hip shoot em' and probably get about half of em' into her. I never use VATS and .45 is very common. My Sword ignores almost all armor, so she dies when she lands, most of the time..
---
 I kill a couple a day and eat Scorchbeast a lot.
---
sorry for being late to the party and asking dumb questions, but how can you tell if a gun or armor has been duped? ( sorry if it was posted elsewhere)
---
True, but there are other ways of detecting dupers, and proper bans can solve this issue. Character deletion comes to mind.
---
I have had adrenal reaction and speed demon on my melee character since i made it 2 monthes ago and they still dont appear on my character sheet. I have done everything from removing all mutations and adding them all manually to testing if they work with random other actions (speed demon appears for 1 frame if i sprint then open my pipboy, but doesnt make me faster or appear any other time). I made a bug report sometime in January, but it was never replied to or mentioned in any patch notes thus far. I am at the point of just making a new character to get my meleer actually minmaxed
---
I would suggest hazmat and popping radx
---
Imagine the day when they realize stash should be unlimited and basic carry weight should be 800.
---
The inventory micro management mini game has already worn me out on fo76. Bugs just made it worse. 
---
That'll be akward haven't seen younin 10 years BUT LOOK
---
Absolutely! At least there is a quick fix
---
Every time I down a sloth I pray it‚Äôs fungus infested üòâ I playa vats/crit build so...mmmm slothshoooms
---
No I choose to believe Todd Howard is the only person. Just sitting at a desk whistling the Skyrim theme song, pushing random buttons on a computer. 
---
It‚Äôs all good. I long ago made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm a huge fucking nerd.
---
Wow, this one almost brings the game up to initial release standards.
---
Fair enough! I kind of like that there is someone out there hunting these bats of prey.
---
I did address this in the original post.
---
Any fix to the dissapearance of BOS Combat Armor plans?
---
Ah yes that is quite the trip. Hopefully they get on this bug soon so you can enjoy your cuppa. Save travels out there my friend.
---
Lol I just bought my friggin bloodied explosive lever dream gun and can‚Äôt even enjoy it.
---
If you have certain mutations, engaging might not be optional.
---
AND washers and dryers. hell, I've even seen a washboard.....
---
In this game were there is a ton of legendary effects and perk card combos, it is going be hard for them to balance this game ever especially when every update breaks something.
---
If you mean real money, everything I said would equally apply to reasons no one should/would pay for anything either. Like I said, I know one person like that who tried to, and I don't think they were successful at all.
---
If the game offers little in the way of challenge, why would you pay real money? More so if what you're getting can be printed like money, it's worth nothing if everyone can have it.
---
I heard the old moderator of market76 was found to be exploiting players trying to sell for real money, and I think that was before duping was really a thing.
---
lol is this skyrim
---
I don't want anyone to have to give me any of their hard-earned shit, it's all good. I'll just farm more with that guy's guide
---
800 as of today
---
I have yet to buy anything from a vendor
---
What kind of build got nerfed this time?
---
Its bugged, because at my 20% hp with nerd rage and bloodied weapon that use to do 1k+ damage it only does 600 damage. So, either Bethesda nerfed a mutation, perk card, or legendary effect without telling us.
---
Screw "in use" icons, what they need to do is just leave armor equipped instead of temporarily removing it every time you put on your PA.  If stacking the DR of the PA and armor is a problem or something then that's something to work on balancing separately, but it's a massive pain in the ass losing inventory space because I no longer have the benefit of Deep Pocketed mods or even worse losing the -20% weight bonuses from my legendary armor.  I tend to play MASSIVELY over encumbered because I hoard so much gear and junk and at my worst times putting on PA ended up putting me over the second weight limit and left me barely able to even walk around.
---
I think I would probably get down with some more pvp if I could store my caps for sure. The problem seems to be that I quickly acquire too much junk, weapons, armor, etc. and go to sell it..spend a bunch of time hopping around the server to acquire the max number of caps... then have to hop around to find something I want that I can spend those caps on...and this whole process can take a good long while. If at any point during this process someone wants to engage in good ol pvp I‚Äôm turning it down because I spent so much time running the caps are now too precious to lose. Just my experience, and maybe I go about it the wrong way and I should just not care as much about getting enough caps to buy that next plan :p
---
Kudos to banning all the dupers hoarding "100,000 ultracite ammo, wah wah 900 hours with my broken back but I got this legit!!" LOL.
---
Shoo little fly hahaha chill mate all is good don't stress 
---
Sad thong is level does mean one thing, how much caps you lose which is bs.
---
 Not lately but I do know where you are coming from. My guy kills em' its his purpose in life and its just fun.
---
 I rarely use Stim Packs and the .45 I use never seems to drop much below 2000 no matter how much I use. I make my other ammo but the .45 is endless.
---
 Did 3 level 80s with others at The Whitespring not long ago and people were laughing at my mad enthusiasm. 
---
 "Now this is fucking cake" ;)
---
Girl. And be sure to invest in pharma farms when you level up. You can search containers using Y and will never need stimpacks again. 
---
Thank you and well said. Everything I've listed in my original post was the facts I have and emails given to me. I can't match the numbers of ultracite ammo they claim I have collected. I can perfectly match the numbers of 5mm ammo they say I had. That lead to my theory that dropping items on the ground is what caused me to create such inflated numbers.
---
Possibly they didn't give me the full list of items in the email. On top of that, I had no items removed in last weeks purge. My ammo counts at last I checked are not even close to the numbers they state. If Bethesda could post what is currently on my accounts it would help, I can't access it.
---
Simply put, some facts are missing, and they can only be gained from Bethesda. If you need more info, ask away. Literally all I fucking care about is getting my account back and to be playing 76 again.
---
Does the user agreement say the burden of proof is on them  (Bethesda) for bans? This isn't the federal court system. They made the rules so the burden of proof is more likely on the user, or in this case there is no burden of proof, just what they say goes. Not that I agree with it but that's how I understand it.
---
i just want a pvp and a pve server
---
How should melee be nerfed exactly? As I understand it (correct me if I'm wrong) it's not one thing that makes melee so good, but rather a lot of things combined that just stack up.
---
I will say I think that, on average, melee should do more damage than guns (because of the range factor) but also that 2k might be a bit excessive.
---
Try removing and re equipping all your dmg perk cards. See if something is buggy in registering them as equipped.
---
Lemme tell you something.. Just about every single in-game friend of mine who got suspended this time was guilty of something. Most of them were mass crafting diluted stimpacks to quickly level up their alts of was actually hoarding massive amounts. Not a single person was wrongfully banned and I respect my friends for their honesty. But for some god damn reason, this subreddit is full of wrongfully banned innocent players. WTF should I make of that?
---
It's a solid build, I had set up my current toon with vats/crits and was 1 shotting level 68 super mutants at level 25 ü§™
---
I genuinely hate that term.  Its very generic and unoriginal anymore
---
I got one full sentinel piece from a roll. Assassins sentinel with so generation it was a blessing, until I found dupers rad already duped the hell out of it.
---
Uh you don‚Äôt have to spend money 
---
Oh no, my stims aren‚Äôt hard earned. I‚Äôve gotten to the point of collecting and crafting them specifically to give them away. So if you do want that offer, it‚Äôs still there. 
---
You can achieve the same thing by pressing the E key rapidly. I'm cutting out the excessive action due to a left scapular injury.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
unfortunately none of that relates to my post- at all. I was talking about god rolls and how hard it is to roll them, the odds being less than 0.000001% in fact. then you came along, claiming I was wrong, completely ignoring the math and using your own, personal experience as proof.
---
except not even that was good enough because none of your so-called "god" rolls are actually godly. they're decent, at best. you never rolled an actual god roll. you just stuck with whatever the game dropped you. that's not a god roll, it's just a roll.
---
so my point still stands despite all your, ahem, "achievements"
---
No more Scorchbeast violating my eyes and ears 0.3 times a second?! Thank the heavens!
---
Seems we agree as far as the edit goes.
---
As far as trading. I consider trading discords and sub-reddits legit. They just aren't in game (because they don't exist).  But unless you spend a ton of time in them and know the "players" (big time traders) then it would be harder to spot market swings from duping.
---
Most of the folks I trade with are 100% legit and you can generally tell from the type of loot they stock. You can tell they get it from farming themselves because it's mediocre to good gear with the occasional great piece.
---
When in power armor your underarmor and armor pieces don't apply. So, like everyone said they have perk cards and legendary gears to use on you. Also, in pvp scenario the lower lvl gets kinda buff since it scales them to your lvl. But you should be able do decent damage to them back though.
---
This happened to me a while back when an update got interrupted.
---
Salute!
---
That's almost my entire point. It's hard to save up enough caps to buy mutation serum plans and they aren't dropping for me at all. So if I sit on say 10k caps, at lvl 150, I'm a prime Target for griefing, and if I have the electrically charged mutation, the game considers that an attack, so I either stay in pacifist mode 24/7, or risk losing caps to some griefer who bought all his op assassins sentinal armor off e-bay.
---
We should be celebrating a great new FO5 game but instead we got this mess.
---
Juge brainwave of cheaters and I still get crashes and server drops in just an hour of playing.
---
Maybe it wasnt the DuPeRs afterall and the servers are just shit?
---
There are zones its workshops and pvp events like the one at the fort up north and watoga monster mash.
---
I have the same issue. I saw another Reddit thread where Bethesda responded. In short: get rid of the mutation and then hope to get it back again and it will work.  Which is just great, considering that I spent thousands of caps on my mutations.
---
The way I understood it was that if you can learn it from scrapping it isn‚Äôt available from a vendor. Went through about 60-70 combat armor arms before I got the BOS recipe.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Bethesda fixed this in the last patch, you‚Äôre talking about the electrically charged mutation?
---
I like your kind, because I enjoy racing. Destroy the turrets, generator, and decon shower then log quick. I haven't been caught yet. But I have a last laugh for when I do get caught.
---
That's where we disagree.
---
Enjoy your mediocre build and weapons. :)
---
I cant. I‚Äôm in prison..  
---
I think the pertinent one is sResourceArchive2List. Pre patch 6 this was the new ATX textures ba2‚Äôs but those have been replaced with new strings. 
---
You can't just say there isn't a reason to play, people find different things fun. If you say there isn't a reason to play then that means people are even less likely to have an amount like 900 hours. You keep trying to disagree with me but you're just proving my points
---
they didn't (I'm one of the people tracking and reporting it) and they didn't fix the scrapping bulk issue. :(
---
And that is exactly what drove duping. Right or wrong, the game favors those with the right gear. Find it, and you rule the wasteland. Demand drove supply.  Couple that with an atrocious system and here we are. 
---
I think the biggest problem with end users &lt;-&gt; help desk support is most end users equate "person answering the phone" with "evil SOB who did thing to me and-- I TAKE MY VENGEANCE!" rather than treating them just like every other working stiff most of us are or rub shoulders with every day in the trenches. When people start from "just _wait_ until I get one of these f***kers on the line," things can't but go downhill from there. We all have jobs to do, some parts of them are shitty for us, some are shitty for our customers, some for all involved, but none of us (user support or end users calling support) are working at the pay grade of "EVIL SOB whose decisions have effed me over-- VENGEANCE!"
---
I must admit, when I was much younger, and much angrier, I often fell into that trap too-- venting at customer support because they were the most proximal representation of BIG EVIL. Then my SO had "the talk" with me about how being a decent human being meant not acting on every emotion, and that I had to consider the impact my words and deeds have on others, and the ripples that spread out from those words and deeds... and the scales fell away. There is just too much anger and pain and suffering in the world to put more out into it (though, I do slip occasionally. To err is human... right? ;) 
---
I hope you dealt only with civil customers today. :)
---
Do these Mentats spark Joy?
---
no
---
If you cure it and get it again it comes back properly. I can craft them for donations/materials. 
---
Honestly if they are going do the pvp server they should force everyone to restart so people don't bring their duped crap to the server. It would make everything fresh start and fair for everyone, until people start no lifing farming legendaries and finding ways to dupe still.
---
Thank you for this comment.  I've got two friends that are currently banned and neither are dupers.  Neither player has had 1000s of one item in their stash. It's bogus. 
---
hey man, at least you got yours fairly. it's more than I can say after dozens of syringers.
---
you beat the rng. you can go home now, you're free.
---
There is no 100% way of know other than just being familiar with what is out there on the trade market. Even then it's possible that someone got the same roll on a weapon and even though it might share stats with the dupe pool, be 100% unique. If Bethesda was smart (and they are don't let this launch fool ya) they are likely implementing weapon tracking in some of these patches they are doing. Would be silly for them not to given this history so far.
---
That's kind of what I'm thinking, but with the lack of any kind of armor, you really turn into a bit of a glass cannon.
---
They separated weapon damage from explosive like it was in fo4, so explosive perk only effects the explosive portion
---
you're disagreeing with math. that can't possibly end well for you.
---
but ok.
---
Actually via PayPal as long as you have them do it under the family &amp; friends selection they can not request it back. 
---
Are you using mods? 
---
I literally had no idea this sub even had moderators given such a shitty job they do.
---
Will try this and see if it works
---
Good grief, this surely cannot be the official answer‚ÄΩ Run the radaway roulette and then spend thousands of caps to replace. Please tell us there will be a swift fix.
---
100 percent agree
---
 Thank you for this suggestion.  My friends are in the wrongly banned category and have heard nothing from Bethesda on how to remedy the issue. 
---
I found out the hard way :(
---
Yes, I didn't see this in the patch notes. I've really just gotten used to server hopping at this point to avoid griefers. It's still a pain though, loading screens are abundant and if I'm 1 point above my limit I hobble like an amputee till I can either sell or stash.
---
This should be one of that last trophies you get really. It's technically the last quest in the Story Line, and you should hit way higher levels before that.
---
What do you mean that video came out when the outfits did? That video came out like a hour ago not when the outfits did.
---
I believe the point of that video was that Bethesda said ‚Äúpurely cosmetic‚Äù micro transactions. But these cosmetics have stat changes, temporary or not. So with that line of reasoning Bethesda would‚Äôve broken their promise. At least thats how I interpreted the video.
---
I disabled all of them
---
The fun part is an u er crit in the sbq...sewing her life bar jump and think, yup, that was me...did y‚Äôall see that? *brushes non-existent specks from shoulder*
---
Mentats no mentatas yes. Boobies are never dull.
---
&gt; Arguing it's not that big of a deal makes a lot more sense imo 
---
As implemented at that time there was nothing wrong with the promotion.
---
Despite thoughts to the contrary this game is still mostly played solo, open the map and look. Outside of Nukes/Silo clearings most of the time there are few player dots within gunfire range of each other.
---
So for a short time most of the player base had access to a short term buff in game for free. We've all mostly reached end game and should have finished the Mystress of Mysteries quest line, which has some fabulous lore and story telling.
---
But lets face it, dying in this game has no consequence actually too little consequence. Die, drop scrap, get scrap, keep going. This isn't a difficult game to get through. 
---
Now if you were one of the few that had friends and played regularly with them yeah there was an issue where you couldn't get the buff while playing with your friends.
---
The atoms are fairly easy to get through the daily's etc, but if you had to have it and weren't doing the daily's then yeah you'd have to pay.
---
Personally I'm saving for the poodle skirt now after spending my saved up atoms on some cool mothman stuff.
---
 
---
&gt; I think the only reason it should be concerning is if they take this same concept and use it in future atomic shop content
---
This is important and worthy of a video. While the promotion wasn't a problem because of the lack of PVP on the server, when the new PVP content/modes are released this is a HUGE problem.
---
Getting a leg up on PVE shouldn't bother anyone, getting a leg up in a PVP situation is a non-starter.
---
They need to be aware and limit that kind of stuff to everyone or just on the PVE focused servers.
---
All in all this wasn't worthy of a 12 minute video and makes gamer journalists youtubers seem as bad as the company they promote. You had a much more sensible take on it.
---
It just seems like you‚Äôd be at a disadvantage if you weren‚Äôt on a team because of certain mutations and perk cards and it would force you into a more stealth play style than one might want to play. Anyways I‚Äôm excited for survival mode to drop and introduce y‚Äôall to my Assasins gauss rifle 
---
Well with workshops people use that to steal ton caps easy they block you so you can't see them coming; have a friend to tell you where your location is and attempt to capture your workshop but not all the way to initate pvp even if your in passive then come to kill you without your passive shield and steal your lvl of caps and rinse and repeat. Now with being able to capture workshops from the whole workshop zone it just going be easier for them since they can attempt in a bush or somewhere hidden from plain sight and use stealth boys or chameleon to attack.
---
Whoa, a sensible post, filled with logic and reasoning?
---
Prepare for mass downvotes from this sub.
---
I want a jetpack. I need to spend more cores.
---
So, cleaning it and reapplying it only fixes it for a few hours?
---
you have to modify your falloutcustom ini. or delete it. theres a couple of posts on what needs to be modified.
---
Okay sounds good
---
Exactly.
---
I spent 3600 caps a week ago on adrenal reaction.....and the fix is........buy it again?
---
And if I lose marsupial trying to dump my glitched adrenal reaction?.......just buy that again also?
---
Well I only have 2700 caps right now so I guess I'm just shit out of luck.
---
I meant general PVP zones that are also world spaces. Workshops are a horrid way to do PVP I think. Easily exploitable especially in teams I‚Äôve heard nothing but horror stories 
---
Find grahm
---
If people drop a nuke on the SBQ properly there is easily 120+ violet flux in the area. If they just do the corners its very little.
---
To get to the insane numbers bethesda claim I have would require either incredible dedication or for me to be cheating. Or there is an issue with how they tally the counts. At one point I think I had 25k .45 ammo.
---
If you look through my post history you'll note that I say I spend a TON of time farming nuked whitesprings. And if you keep looking you'll see posts about how I have over 200 pounds worth of stable flux in my bank at once. This is because I play a lot and loot everything. 
---
Now if you keep reading you'll take note that many of the things I post are related to weight reduction. I am and was a massive hoarder. Only recently changing my style after acquiring enough scrap to last for a very long time.
---
If people actually cared, actually gave a fuck, they would look deeper. But they don't. I had write ups ready with detailed lists of The Mire and The Cranberry Bog locations and what each spot has. I deleted both. I don't care anymore. 
---
All I want is my account back and to be playing 76. Once I'm back I'm deleting my friends list and the text chat mod. People are fucking awful. I'm going to keep playing fallout my way, Bethesda be damned.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre comment was the first mention of it I saw, then I kept scrolling on down the newest page and there were several people talking about it. Bummer, I hope they hot fix it soon, until then I‚Äôm shelving my bloody heavy gunner.  
---
Is it possible since they added the plans to enclave bunker and queen got drop updates they removed the mutation plans from her drop table, so only way is to save up months worth of caps just to get 1 mutation plan?
---
Yeah, it explains that other people see it differently then you. And that's okay.
---
People dont always share the same opinions.
---
Maybe it was someone else's i'm remembering then.  I saw a half dozen at least at the time bethesda made that fucking idiotic mistake. I'll edit my reply. 
---
How do you expect them to prevent people from teaming up?  Even if you take out the invite option, people are going to anyways..
---
I actually came out of it pretty well. I got an instigating assaultron blade, and two legendary marine armor arms (left and right!) that are exactly what I wanted. The legendary spawns also put me over the top on the enclave quest so I got the rewards for that too! (Finally got my spiffy hat and coat!)
---
I used to do a decent amount of damage until the nerfs decimated my build. 
---
I've had the simple pylons and the switched pylons do this occasionally also. But not reliably to where I could count on it
---
You are right, must have been a daily for huge creatures that I completed. Looking at this now and it hasn‚Äôt checked off anything that I have killed recently
---
Because he wasn't 1000 hour guy
---
Then thank bugthesda cause they screwed you brother.
---
You on PS4?
---
Or just not use mods....
---
I never see the atom shop load super slow since the recent updates, this would have been a thing when in beta or release. Also, I only check the shop if there is a new limited item or sale lol.
---
I did an enclave quest in Harper's Ferry (the one where you triangulate the supply drop) during a nuke and ho-lee shit was that insane. 
---
Game still locks if you press B too quickly üôÑ
---
Is this real life.
---
Why do you assume melee folks wanted TSE nerfed?
---
Got a source for such a claim?
---
I've been melee only since beta and wanted nothing but buffs for certain guns in this game...
---
Wait, it doesn‚Äôt work?
---
/s?
---
Did any of your friends put in 900 hours? How about 800?  700? No? Thought so. If you only view the world from what you want to see you'll never be able to see what the reality around you is. 
---
Face the facts Bethesda has a track record of buggy or incomplete systems. Just look at the bug list you'll know I'm right. With the amount of people posting about being falsely banned being so high do you think that all of them are 100% lying? We should at the very least be concerned over this not be aggressively toxic like your behavior is.
---
Also you answered none of my questions. Seems you either don't have the time to fact check your own statements or you know the things you are saying is false and you just want to be dismissive. Either or, unless you have something you can actually back up with evidence stop posting your dismissive comments. 
---
They were removed from her loot table? If so I didn't know that. But they hiked the cost of the serums up so high that you have to save for months to get 1 plan. It's dumb. Super dumb.
---
I'm not using any of them
---
Nope. That didn‚Äôt change anything at all. Definitely been nerfed. 
---
When did Bethesda say that as far as modders they have no idea how Bethesda is tracking the data on their server databases for this new game so that's completely irrelevant.
---
"Ya gotta shoot em in the head."
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
I'm a solo player who just paid 3600 caps at the enclave last week and Bethesda is telling me it's no biggie just go drop another 3600 for another serum.
---
Let me take a rad x and hope I don't lose my marsupial mutation........we all know what the Bethesda solution to that is......just buy another one of those too.
---
I feel like most weapons are kinda inferior to melee weapons now. Even with the mutation bug. Still sucks that when your use to one shotting lvl 60+ now sometimes take 2 hits because of the bug.
---
I got banned 2 days ago. I have no idea why. I don‚Äôt have two of any item except the normal stuff like stimpacks and junk. I‚Äôve bought and traded weapons with players. It is possible I had a duped item in my stash but still they said I had 100,000 legendary items wtf??? My account is totally legit. I don‚Äôt even have a mule character. Anyway, I sent a ticket and dude got back to me asking my psn handle and account stuff. He never got back to me. In my ‚Äúaccount suspended‚Äù email it said ‚Äúthis decision is final, and no further appeals will be considered.‚Äù So he wouldn‚Äôt even tell me why I got banned. I know I never had 100,000 legendary items. So either they are completely full of sh** or they had a complete moron write the algorithm to find the duper‚Äôs. Either way I‚Äôm pissed. I didn‚Äôt do any type of exploit at anytime and my account is banned. Now there was the new patch today and my account is still banned. So I have to wait  another month or two for the next one??? Wtf??? Anybody no what‚Äôs really going on???
---
Not really.  Just demonstrates that you have the IQ of a small child and only think about yourself. You can PvP all you want. Just find others who want to also. 
---
Stupid griefers...
---
I did that, still not working 
---
A moderator deleted it. Along with every other "I was banned" post. There is a pinned post about.
---
You can't force anyone to send money through "friends &amp; family" when you sell on ebay.  If you request that it's like saying "Hey, I'm going to steal your money".  
---
  A small example. I take explosive damage in my X0-1, but my Heavy Combat Armor with a Dense Chest and Strengthened Limbs takes none at all.
---
  That's right, no damage at all. So your TSE is just a gun to me. ;)
---
I don't think duping is acceptable ever, period. And I wish permanent bans on everyone who does it, whether to make money or just for their own benefit, because that's an unfair advantage over other players.
---
That said, I understand what you're saying and think most would agree the game is too grindy. I think introducing more RNG to locations and mobs, and making exploring more profitable could do a lot to encourage less tedious approaches to gathering resources.
---
u cant detect sarcasm?
---
Person is offended by a game. Must make a whole video trash the game every single time over every little thing.
---
I feel like what drove duping was because they can and it makes their lives easier in they can rake in the caps without doing work and trade for whatever they want, it basically the people that go into console commands and give their character everything they want and the games challenge is ruined.
---
I did this it did not work!
---
Like Bowler / Bowler Hat, there are also two different Straightjacket items with different weights and values.
---
And one of them thar Scrubby board thingys on your chest for the scratchy scratchy snare.
---
really? glowing ones everywhere?
---
You mean the explosives nerfs? Because I had to go into unyielding bloodied build to kill stuff now and that leaves me a glass cannon.
---
do not buy it does not work, wait for fix
---
Ah damn. Sorry to hear that. Hopefully this gets addressed.
---
This was like when the game first started experiencing duper‚Äôs, I picked all of it up then dropped it all and logged out so my bag disappeared and it all got ate by the void 
---
Can you point me to the law you're referring to? I honestly have never heard this and am intrigued.
---
This was my exact line of thought. When I realized I could keep farming ammo non stop and trade it all to a different account for storage, farming ammo became a norm.
---
Just last week I wanted to make all my shotguns Prime. So I got into nuked whitesprings and gathered a ton of fluorescent flux and enough nuked materials. I already had the scrap for the ammo in my stash. I think I crafted 4000+ prime shotgun rounds while doing fairly standard nuked zones.
---
That blows, but thanks for the heads up before I wasted more caps
---
It just works 
---
That was my thought as well, but I‚Äôve seen more than a few people here say ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs hunters‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt personally done rigorous testing, and my Zealot‚Äôs 50cal is also Primed, so I can‚Äôt compare easily. 
---
I wouldn't call any off-network trading community "legit", purely because there's no baked in backing or protection from repercussions from the company.  Pretty much every game with a tradable item economy HAS them, but Bethesda's in an odd place where they don't provide the _option_ of doing it in house. 
---
As for "knowing the players" I agree. You probably won't concretely know who the major dupers are and are not. But you will be aware that the problem EXISTS, and that you are taking that risk. 
---
Frankly, the hardcore traders who are majorly into it are more likely to be able to walk through that mess safely. 
---
If John Q Public went in, looked at a bunch of listings and went "OOH, THAT looks like a nice gun, plz take my caps" he's not tracking the "meta" he's not looking at post after post of identical duped gear. He's not seeing the patterns of "this specific gun with these specific affects and mods show up all the time, best avoid those". 
---
He's buying the best gun he can afford. Which, most likely, is duped. And if he has half a brain, after reading this subreddit or any other for five seconds, he's aware of that possibility. 
---
Gatling guns are nerfed or ‚Äúfixed‚Äù after several patches of being ‚Äúnot fixed‚Äù
---
I mean, I do agree with you to a point, but I also see a lot of flaws in this game in general that take away from replay value, and I don't mean duping.
---
Bethesda may surprise me and add content that breathes life back into this game, but that seems less likely if they're creating this much chaos banning the wrong people.
---
I have one friend that got banned that I know 110% shouldn't have been banned based upon their reasoning. I'm sure many players know others or their own situation that shouldn't be banned, the first person who commented said they got theirs removed along with an apology.
---
I think the other guy has it right - hit touchpad PS4 to enter build menu - which lets you activate PVP.
---
Stick with what you have however they have said they plan on buffing their durability. I do use a spread shot auto laser rifle and while its damage is really good, it breaks in a few clips so I basically use it as a backup "this needs to die" weapon.
---
I guess really the main thing I am curious about is, how often you moved things between alts, such as the ultracite ammo and how much ultracit ammo would you say that you had in total at any given point?  If it was something you moved back and forth regularly, I could definitely see the problem being that they tracked each transfer as a 'new amount' rather than the same ammo moving back and forth.

I been using escape artist which is actual insane to throw in there, I love the freedom to play how I want to in this game
---
I run an unarmed explosive build.
---
Generally if people place the nuke right for the queen PA or heavy rad resistance is not needed 
---
For nuke springs, if you strength is high enough and you have decent melee weapon and supporting perks/mutations you can rank the ghouls in PA without needing gladiator or slugger though you could consider getting the initial perk in each of the 3 ranks if you‚Äôre having trouble 
---
As for ranged combat, since you‚Äôre already in strength use the shotgun perk (with skeet shooter in perception) or heavy gun perks on strength 
---
Most are just instigating Butthurt.
---
 No it explains the massive entitlement that the young seem to feel. Where I come from and I'm old, cheating is just fucking bad. That's it, no extenuating circumstances, its a game, you either cheat or don't. And if you do you are an asshole. ;) Its pretty simple.
---
They are, made a post about it and lot of dumb replies thinking its not exploitable. Sad thing is doubt Bethesda is going do anything about it. Honestly pvp events would have been fun if they 1 forced everyone into an rp role, like everyone has the same gear/weapons stats, no perk cards or player owned stuff and no one loses caps and junk on death. So, its all base on skill, aim, reaction time, cunning, etc. Also, the rewards need to be better like rare plans, outfits, cap bonuses, 3 star legendaries guaranteed for the victors.
---
You too friend, for the 2 more months ( or less) that the game will last. Try ET for Atari after, they will probably bury Fallout 76 copies next to the ET catriges cemetery, make sure to grab a copy there! If you liked Fallout 76 you will find ET a masterpiece. Have fun!
---
Correct. So it seems. I've got -hp only showing now. Again.
---
Well considering that it's not listed in the hot topics and it's a pretty big f'ing deal for bloodied builds.........
---
What do you expect?.......they nerf TSE and force everyone into bloodied builds and then the update bricks the living shit out of bloodied builds........and you're surprised that there's a bunch of threads being posted about it?
---
You‚Äôll learn, young padwan. 
---
I was like you once too. 
---
You‚Äôll learn. 
---
 Some folks have been emailed,  but not all. 
---
Had my vampire tse smg deleted by a quest glitch and a patch that ruined my gauss rifle. Melee and pistol is all I can do to get anywhere but even then I easily get one shot killed in PVP. 
---
honestly the only thing keeping me playing this game is my love for fallout. Any other game and I‚Äôd uninstall instantly . Let‚Äôs hope it gets better for us 
---
Its not working? Lol okay so that explains my gun damage changing drastically after the update
---
This looks awesome. As I expected the dev's are working through the issues that they can. Many of the items resolved I only saw discussed in the last week, so as always I'm excited to play the game more. Thanks.
---
I don't know was asking if they were since there been a lot of changes to vendors and plan drops ever since plans got guarantee to vendors.
---
Wireless, I've got a length of old ethernet cord somewhere around that I may switch to.
---
People already dump caps to other people so they can attack people at no risk to them. Storing caps wouldn't fix the issue. People will grief just because they are bored assholes. The loot or caps people lose because they choose to engage them just makes it more motivating. You should lose something when you engage in PVP and die. That being said the PVP system doesn't work well in many cases. If you get griefed leave the server and block them.
---
Why would you assume it's melee players calling for the nerf? There's no way you'd even know unless every player who complains says "my only character is melee spec, but TSE is OP and should be nerfed".
---
Breakdown the math on that.
---
I deleted my customini, that did the trick. Thanks 
---
Yea I always had it slotted...then added another pt to adrenaline and haven‚Äôt bothered to make a lower ranking card, bad Yab...Lazy Yab
---
Yeah cause ethernet gives big speeds and it's the best 
---
He's a troll. He's as much of a fool here online as he appears to be in the game. No sense ingetting too worked up about him. He clearly has some issues that he's trying to compensate for. 
---
Hopefully he can hook up with a good therapist. Otherwise heaks destined a life of online trolling and a real life job stocking shelves at payless. 
---
So now you are generalizing, as well as incapable understanding nuance.
---
You really must be getting old.
---
There's something even more wrong now that people stopped understanding what the word objectivity means.
---
Hint: You don't have any. 
---
That stuff you do have, which looks just like it, is called subjectivity.
---
It's been confirmed the cause of the purple color is you have a mod installed, but ok, just keep denying it.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten to play yet, does this mean just walking into an owner workshop zone will trigger taking it over? Only if it‚Äôs owned by another player? As owner do I get a notification? 
---
Dude just run fucking juicehead got involved to 
---
It gets better then gets worst, like a really bad rollercoaster.
---
Maybe by next year if devs haven‚Äôt killed themselves by then working w/ a shit engine that keeps busting out bugs every patch.
---
You can get the T45 T51b T60 and raider PA plans as well as chems junk aid weppons various plans for camp weppons and armour have also got some mod plans for different PA and BOS Marian armour paint plans. Scrapping all weapons and armour I get from these also helps me unlock weppons mods and armour mods quickly and provides me with a lot of junk.
---
Now I know why my enemies are always highlighted when I play with a particular friend! 
---
Very often. Like 2-3 times per week I would drop stuff off onto my second account. Excess ammo, chems, water, scrap and gear. 
---
I recently revamped my play style to both include and remove a .45 gun and a 5.56 gun. Both times when adding/removing the gun I'd remove the ammo.
---
Essentially I am non stop playing a game of trial and error with what I feel is the best way for me to play. Weight vs weapon usefulness. 
---
In PA with no melee perks I can one shot pretty much an entire non nuke whitespring run with an instigating axe (1*). I did it first to conserve ammo ... but man it is so easy and faster with no arbitrary VATs missing all the first shots.
---
So bad bugs we banned Bethesda!
---
No, that's why I thought it was intentional. It didn't affect any other weapons fire rate. Plus in theory the faster you crank the faster you can shoot. Faster melee swing = faster crank. At least that's how I rationalized it. I was wrong though, not a big deal. 
---
You're probably ok, but obviously take this as a lesson moving forward.  Don't cheat or you might (likely) will get banned.
---
Lets try warframe, i just finished installing it. i hope your fallout life gets resurrected though! my name there is obtuseobtuse as it is in fallout
---
I can‚Äôt imagine the rads per second good lord
---
Was the glitch Mama Dolce's event? I feel like pvp is pointless, if they are running bloodied then its probably easy to one shot them if not, there isn't a point to engage cause they can be running assassin sentinel. Only thing keeping me playing is getting all plans, getting rare outfits, waiting for cool stuff in the atom shop. Feel like this game would have been way better if it was released as a fallout story game that you can do coop up to 25 people lol; so that people could build cities, etc like minecraft servers.
---
You got banned didn't you?  You cheated.  Have a nice day, find another game, or if they ever unban you, stop cheating.
---
Too busy getting circlejerk Bethesda hate views
---
Yeah, I had a brief window of play earlier and someone nukes the queen and I thought I was doing way less damage but there was a bunch of people there so that‚Äôs what I attributed it too, now I know lol.
---
Easy, just depends if you want a traditional warrior or a max damage kinda build 
---
You didn't earn 100k+ of anything, you're a duper or you were given duped items. You're also a moron for carrying that much and not expecting to get banned.
---
Thanks. Now I get it.
---
That‚Äôs annoying.
---
Random loot my ass, my trust is dwindling. 
---
I loaded into a nuke literally being dropped on my head recently, got turned to ash before I actually loaded in. I feel like there should be a warning like the CAMP one. 
---
I'm gonna give it 1 more day. A HUGE reason I love fallout 76 is VATS. But I am gonna spend the day watching warframe videos, hopefully pump myself up.
---
In RL?  That'd be murder if you're not familiar with the legal process.  But as we're not discussing murdering or violence on anyone, just removing them from a forum that is specifically related to a game they're banned from, I suspect you're being sarcastic.
---
I was in whitesprings just before the dev room info became widespread and someone dropped a paper bag with 1 each of a bunch of plans I had not seen in front of me. I did the wave emote and picked them up and learned them. Then the  very next day I saw a post explaining that the most likely came from the dev room and have been expecting a ban message ever since.
---
PC
---
I guess I'll just have to jump off of buildings in my ultracite armor to damage enemies with the 30 explosive vents plans that I've gotten every time I fought the queen........oh wait....... explosive vents are bugged and don't work either.
---
My friend and I were playing last night and had a lvl68 legendary super mutant ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù in Westek. He was on the floor above us when we killed him. Both of us are like, let‚Äôs get up there ASAP. We head directly up to the spot where was killed only for him to not be there. I know I was in the correct location because he was standing directly next to another mutant that we killed and that body was actually there.  This is the first time I‚Äôve had a legendary disappear on me, and I am notably frustrated by it but decide to keep searching for the body anyway just incase I am missing something. After a solid few minutes of double checking every corpse and meat pile in the damn building, I actually found him. The body was nowhere near where we had killed him. It was on a floor below where was killed on damn near the other side of the room. 
---
I have zero technical knowledge when it comes to video games so I have no fucking idea what happened but that shit was wild. Glad I found his ass too because I got a bloodied 50 cal off of him. 
---
TLDR: Apparently sometimes corpses drop in alternate locations from where you actually kill them? Check EVERYWHERE for that missing legendary corpse, it might be on a whole different floor than where you killed it. Hahaha
---
Right I get that but then they wouldn‚Äôt benefit from team mutations and perks which can add significant health and damage outputs per teammate. Also the way vats works they‚Äôd probably end up targeting their own teammate at some point on accident.
---
honestly I‚Äôm just ready to PvP but I don‚Äôt play in a team so I feel like it might be a disadvantage, but I‚Äôm also a stealth sniper so I‚Äôm not too worried.  
---
As a side not I think Team servers along faction lines would be Awesome. BOS vs. Enclave 
---
You‚Äôve got it. My Beth name is Nathan_TK. Just drop me a DM or something with yours so I know who ya are. 
---
I found and saved a pair of two-shot black powder pistols on my pistol character. Got to level 50 to use them, and bam! Two-shot nerfed in the patch. Now they're just extra weight.
---
I didn't hear anyone complaining about the unstoppable outfits being pay to win. I have a lot of atoms but I am not gonna spend them on some outfits that gives +15 hp (solo) even if it's permanent. To get a +60 hp bonus I would have to consistently play with 4 ppl. I doubt anyone else lost their shit over the outfit having an insignificant hp bonus.
---
Even if it was, a Gauss rifle should be a pretty high damage weapon. It was probably one of, if not the best gun to use in the older games. 
---
The whole charge thing kinda ruined it for me since the game CONSTANTLY bugs out when trying to fire quickly resulting in the gun not actually firing and I have to recharge it again :(
---
Your son did.  Again, life lesson from it.  Don't cheat.
---
Nope. Don't think they are flagging wrong players. It's just that their standards change all the time and what was thought to be ok turns out it can get you banned now and that upsets many people and make them think they were wrongfully banned. I mean, who would have thought 400k ultracite ammo could get you banned legit or not? Oh and about hours played, someone done the math and it turns out to come up with 400k ultracite ammos, 900 hours just ain't enough unless you dedicated all your playtime on collecting fluxes and ammocrafting. Just an FYI
---
 There is no nuance in cheating asshole. That's just dishonest.
---
Oh thanks. 
---
I've used a 15 luck build and since the patch before today's four leaf clover and grim reapers sprint have never worked since then for me on xbox.  I was hoping today's patch would fix but didn't.  I've tried psycho as substitute and though it's chance to work are slimmer it never worked either.  Still three shots for a crit with critical saavy max on regardless of above said equipped. 
---
I blew out thru my nose a little. 
---
You need 1 hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluid, then 10 raw flux of any one kind to make a pure flux. Different recipes will need different color flux. Fissure site prime has diverse enough plants to farm most of the colors, cobalt being the exception as far as I can tell. You can pick up violet flux from the small groups of trees around fissure prime, I think the plant is a flash fern. 
---
Flux is the easy part IMO, getting equal amounts of the other 3 can be difficult.
---
Not so black and white when supporting it becomes necessary for survival.
---
I'm level 170 now, but at level 60 it seemed like every asshole had a TSE something or other. Closest I got to that? An exploding ultracite laser pistol. Absolute crap. And every time I ran into someone my level or up, I'd be demolished. It's no fun having to battle low levels just for it to feel fair. No fun only hitting a couple glowing ghouls in the nukespring.
---
So I sought out a player who had something I could use to even the field, and he had DOZENS of TSE weapons, selling me one for 5k caps.
---
I had to support a duper just to hold my own against other players, just so I could actually enjoy the game. I shouldn't have to do that just to enjoy a game I payed full price for. 
---
I honestly just set it down when I started feeling railroaded.  This was relatively late-stage, but when I got to a group that I totally disagreed with, there were no options beyond "do what the group says."  Even tried killing them all - didn't get XP, loot, or fail the quest.
---
jumped on for 20 minutes at lunch and it seemed pretty stable.  
---
That said still the occasional hitches just felt a bit less frequent and also seems to recover faster.  This is all on pc.
---
I would too &amp; am female gamer + female character to boot. 
---
Not so easy
---
True, but I never said this would be a be all end all solution.
---
Yeah m8, thank your lads back in Bethesda for including my hometown of Fairmont
---
Oh wait...
---
Ok, that fixed the atom shop items I had go missing, but for some reason my bathtub is invisible? When trying to replace it game says it is intersecting with an exsisting item, but the bathtub is invisible just like the atom shop were. Any ideas?
---
 I'm just pointing out the possibilities in armor builds are extensive and PA is not the best available for some situations.  Unyielding builds will stop a lot of player damage for instance.
---
Please don‚Äôt make me think of what this game could‚Äôve been :( 
---
I was under the assumption when it came out we‚Äôd be able to rebuild the cities using the Fallout 4 styled settlement system with friends. The whole ‚Äúrebuild America‚Äù thing got me hyped
---
But instead we got a buggy unfinished turd with everything scaled back so much it makes Fallout 4 feel like a masterpiece
---
AND WHY CANT I PICK UP WORLD OBJECTS AND THROW THEM AT PEOPLE! I DEMAND BETHESDA ALLOW ME TO HIT PEOPLE WITH MY COLLECTION OF TOYS 
---
First, kudos to you for taking the time to have a legit conversation about this even though you may not agree 100%.  This sub is frequently lacking in that.
---
But the later part of your post is indeed what I was talking about earlier. Some who just pops in and looks for a gun that does what they want will have no idea what the market is for that type of gun.  Should they lose thier weapon even if it was duped. Probably not. And Bethesda seems to agree which is why the snap left one of every dupe in your inventory.
---
They don't really have a way of tracking me (knew the weapon I bought was likely duped) vs John Q Public who just happened to drop by and buy the best thing he could for the caps he had.
---
They could have just removed everything they suspected was duplicated in game but they had to draw a line somewhere. Again, I would have been fine with it. I even stopped trading with folks once I knew the de-dupe was going to happen "just in case" something of mine disappeared. Didn't want any unhappy customers.
---
I just did it and it didn't work for me but it's not a super huge deal
---
I'm pretty sure its a rifle. I have 3 level 50 Perfect Storms on my auto-rifle character.
---
‚ÄúSurvival‚Äù and ‚Äúdisadvantage‚Äù go hand and hand
---
Just a heads up because I never see this mentioned in patchnotes... teammates still ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù all the time. Really kills playing with friends. Any info on that? 
---
I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe the BoS just didn‚Äôt have time to research a jet pack for it. 
---
Besides that though, the T-51b and X-01 have better resistances. The ultra comes in at a nice third place. 
---
I agree. An optional would be to view them on YouTube. USUALLY someone will post a presentation of atomic shop items. Not the best option though. 
---
I'm saying they're being paid to do a job. and you want me give them a pass for being incompetent?
---
yeah, I don't think so. that's very subjective to me.
---
Thanks I agree. I'm happy with what there is compared to what I paid for the game and compared to other fallout titles. 
---
They don't force anyone into any build. That's just people chasing the elusive 1-shot. But they're going to wipe those out soon. Some trash enemies should be one-shots but some need to be a little harder to kill for a challenge
---
Where is it located in the build menu?
---
Known to only work for an hour (or disease) hits.  Not a valid work-around unless they want people to constantly re-apply all mutations.
---
Exp is eh, the drops are garbo, there is barely any 3 stars; don't get why people waste time on nuking that place.
---
And I‚Äôm saying that I live in a different place, where we believe treating people like that is unacceptable, and being a consumer doesn‚Äôt give you a right to treat people the way you do. 
---
An that that matters far more than what you‚Äôre saying matters (game quality). 
---
Played for about an hour tonight on PC. Some observations:
---
* Looks like some little aspects of certain areas might have been altered? For example I seem to recall a toolbox in the back of the dump truck behind the Whitesprings Hotel, and another one in the back of a golf cart nearby. Neither were there but a ghoul was lying in the dump truck (not the usual one beside it but an extra one in the truck bed). 
---
* Encountered one situation at Whitesprings in the laundry building, where looting dead ghouls caused me to become overencumbered - and instead of just having my running cost AP, I was completely unable to run, could only walk. I was at 243/240. After I scrapped that bunch of junk, acquiring more junk behaved as it has before (can still run until AP runs out).
---
* On about 2 out of 5 fast-travel actions, the sound of a mine being triggered sounded - just once, and then stopped - as the loading into the new area finished.
---
* Unsure if this was a slow-loading cell or something more serious, but the Charleston train station did not have a door between the platform and the vendorbot (could walk into his area) and there was no cash register and no suitcases.
---
* Homebody used to bring my health up very swiftly without the use of meds. When I got back to my CAMP tonight as I finished my session, this did not happen. The description on my stats/effects page says "+200 limb regen" so I'm not sure if it was ever supposed to renew HP quickly.
---
Same i found an awesome laser rifle at a vendor someone sold and only bought it out of boredom as im not an energy weapons lover and it is now my emergency backup because its so powerful but so fragile. Cant wait for a buff to them.
---
Queen is different, I mean regular mobs at different lvls.
---
To be fair, they should have been available for it from the beginning anyway
---
I have got hundreds upon hundreds of the hardened masses and such from when the Glowing Ones spawned like crazy in Whitespring. Max out some of the weight reduction perks and they barely weigh anything at all so you can store a shitload on an alt.
---
At least where ammo is concerned, why would anyone ever bother duping and risking getting caught when you can make a lifetime supply of ammo in a week. I've taken a break from the game partly for fear of everyone and their mother getting banned for just playing, and partly cuz of Anthem and the new Far Cry coming out.
---
There are a lot of ways they could‚Äôve balanced it. More testing would‚Äôve fixed about 75 percent of my issues. 
---
And yes, you‚Äôre right in saying it is hard to balance that stuff, which begs the question of why they rushed it out the door. Also not providing players with any form of test environments for potential game breaking patches is beyond me. 
---
Please provide proof he was duping. All he claimed was transferring ammo between miles. And by the way  since I'm sure you dont know how Bethesda ttacks none unique items  I'll educate your.
---
If he had 5k ammo, dropped it and picked it back up, Bethesdas system would read as if 10k ammo has passed his inventory. We know this based on how Bethesda have stated this is how it worked in previous Fallout games, and modders have confirmed it. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand. 
---
If I get re-mutated, the problem doesn‚Äôt assert itself permanently? 
---
Because it was the first article I saw about it, and because I thought I'd share info to others who also may not have seen it. I don't care what articles you subscribe to, they all have the same info. I was telling someone,who was posting about wanting content, about how there will be new content. So no, my post stays up thanks. 
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but 1v5 is a pretty big disadvantage lol
---
This is brigading again... 
---
I saw maybe three post on it and everyone was like meh it's barely a health increase and it only last a week oh no 
---
Yeah was hoping we could build our camps next to each other and have a mini settlement. I think the problem is Bethesda wanted this game to be jack of all trades but master of none. They really shouldn't have went the pvp route and just done pve and eventually do pvp server etc. Funny thing is we can't pick up stuff, but objects kinda have physics so you could shoot them or melee them to move them. Guess Bethesda didn't like people putting buckets on npcs and pickpocketing them freely lol, broke the immersion for them.
---
Did you read the email? His account was banned for 140k ultracite ammo... The other bit with the .45, 5.56, and 5 mm and 220k ultracite ammo was another account. Key word being account, it was in association with a separate account not character or alt. The word chosen was account. Crafting 140k ultracite is possible especially within 30 days. But again we aren't talking about crafting, this is simply having 140k transferred over your account within 30 days which is entirely doable, easily. Please say something relevant.
---
I joined in late on this one as well. Wasn't intending on it. Was on my vendor run and when I got to whitesprings I was just going to nip into the enclave bunker to do my shopping but as I got there all hell was breaking loose. So I joined in. In all the times I've been to a nuked WS it's never been like it was earlier. Glowing ones were spawning everywhere , all the time. Seemed to be no waiting for a reset. I just kept going round past the outer houses on the right then to the club house and then past the houses on the left. Get back up by the laundry then go round again. And they just kept spawning and coming. Also an unusually high amount of legendaries too. Almost everyone was a 1 star and every 5th or 6th was a 3 star. Throw in a load of glowing wolves and radstags and a Scorchbeast and a few other randoms. There was about 6 or 7 toons just going round and round. We were all letting each other get a tag on the mobs too (normally there's that one guy with a TSE just destroying everything before anyone else gets a chance). Got loads of legendary weapons and armour. I did this for about 40 mins and it was non stop until the nuke cloud finally dispersed. Absolute bedlam. I had a riot. It was bloody great and by far my best experience of a nuked whitesprings. 
---
 My present char with Heavy Combat with Dense on the chest and Strengthened on the Limbs is immune to explosive damage. That TSE is just a gun to me.
---
 I have no sympathy whatsoever, you are just dishonest.
---
I know it‚Äôs 180 ammosmith rounds per batch for both .50 cal and 5mm (plus SD‚Äôs 30% chance for an extra 100 rounds, if the rumor it doesn‚Äôt dupe ammosmith added ammo is true), but yeah, Ultracite ammo type would be a huge factor here. The BGS email just says ‚ÄúUltracite Ammo‚Äù though. 
---
Main point, though, is the email doesn‚Äôt say he *produced* all the ammo, just that he ‚Äúacquired‚Äù it ‚Äúwithin 30 days of game play.‚Äù I don‚Äôt see his post as claiming he crafted 140k+225k Ultracite rounds, just that he crafted those he had and thinks BGS is counting ammo as ‚Äúacquired‚Äù every time it‚Äôs dropped/picked up or traded among characters. Which could cause a more reasonable amount of ammo in the tens of thousands range to multiply fast.
---
I've done this challenge before and it worked but this one doesn't. I got feeling it is like that collect flowers/plant weekly that worked the first time and was broken for 2 weeks.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. It‚Äôs a known limitation. Speed demon only stacks with the extra kick from strange in numbers, nothing else. 
---
I will probably be down voted for saying this, but....Jesus, 900 hours? And it just came out in the fall?
---
Brochacho, they did you a favor. Just go outside for a bit. No game is worth your life, and since the fall, you've given yours to Fallout freakin' 76.
---
He didn't have over 100k ammo, Bethesda said over 300k ammo had passed his inventory over a 30 day period. If your wondering what this means because reading comprehension is hard, it means if you have 5k ammo, drop it then pick it back up, it will read as 10k ammo. The dude had moved some thousands of ammo, say 5k, between his 2characters a few times, the numbers would be inflated. 
---
Yeah, this is a pretty popular spot due to the proximity to Whitesprings, as it's outside the average nuke zone. Some put up C.A.M.P. up by the lake with the PA spawn, but I've seen several from Texture Glitch rock all the way towards Blackwater Mine.
---
Mine is hanging precipitously off the cliff face, where I can snipe Moleminers off my porch while drinking Whiskey. Then superhero jump down in PA to loot their corpses.
---
He could have put it better but he is not wrong.  You dont seperate dupers into two catagories.  You are either cheating/duping in an online game and deserve a ban or you are not duping/cheating.
---
Four leaf clover making a critical available no longer happens,  Grimm reaper sprint refilling AP no longer happens for me on Xbox since patch before today's.  Can't get psychopath to work either. 
---
Also, to that point, have caps removed from "wanted" people via their "bank"
---
See, what I'd love is if people like \_you\_ would get the godamn ban hammer. 
---
Duped way to much shit myself...over 1 million nuka cola easy! Hundreds of tse weapons thousands of flux and stem packs antibiotics ammo...ffs I was sure I would never have to pick up shotgun shells again! BUT! I got busted! Bethesda-1 Me-0. Good game bethesda! Had I known they could track this is would have never done it. I enjoy this game a lot! Pushing 500 hours. With this said does anyone have any information on when this temp ban will end? (Fyi before I get roasted I no longer have this stuff...they successfully deleted it all last week. ) I will take my punishment (better then most) just want to know if I have to sit out for a week, month or even a year?
---
Melee.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt worry mate this sub is still trying to push the ridiculous idea that the reception of this game is a huge conspiracy by YouTubers and new Vegas fanboys from /r/fallout to the point there has been at least twenty threads like these inciting others to brigade... 
---
Truly pathetic tbh.
---
From what i know, it's 50% max and missing a bullet doesn't reset stacks. And it's worthy noting that it's 1 stack per burst, which means to fully utilize your automatic furious weapons, you have to land some bursts to get the stacks before going full auto
---
I'd jump back into the game immediately if my Blackbird skin got an Excavator skin
---
PC Player in North America, I need Healing Factor, Speed Demon and  Marsupial. Won't be risking Adrenal Reaction until they decide to fix it.
---
Player Tag: HappyCamper781. Will be home from work in about an hour. Please friend me and I can meetup for this.
---
For sure, aa shotguns are really good atm, I pref to just spray down enemies with shotguns just to tag stuff, let the bullets fly
---
They really shouldn't have done pvp and just put pvp into like a game mode like team deathmatch, deathmatch, battle royale etc, or when you pvp in the world have only aid items, vanilla defense and damage apply and lvl scaling, nothing else.
---
Why would you spend 3600 on a serum? That‚Äôs a little silly considering you could buy any serum you want for 300 caps from someone on one of the trading subreddits 
---
Could you possibly post a screen shot for proof? Just to reassure some of us ?
---
Why would you buy a serum for 4k?
---
Me too i had it entirely destroyed in one hot twice
---
Bethesda has legitimately fucked up way too many times now. What do you expect from a company that cant even fix bugs from their previous titles, and have them show up again in the newest one?
---
There's a perk to negate most of that damage 
---
Hi diddly ho, neighborino!
---
If people don't post a million posts about something, it doesn't garner enough attention for the BGS employees to consider it a priority within the next patch, which would horribly enough probably won't come for another 2 weeks.
---
I don't use a bloody build, but I understand this would be affecting close to 50% of the player base and it's a bit ridiculous that they'll have wait like 2 weeks between patches (that's way too few for a buggy game) that may not even fix it (so many problems are constantly left out of patches).
---
So yeah, they are gonna post. It doesn't affect you, but greatly affects them. Don't be so salty.
---
I'm not talking about the game specifically, more so about responsibility. a continued display of incompetence is a great way to get yourself fired. in the real world people don't care whether your feelings are hurt.
---
and I'd love to be your neighbor because I could just fail spectacularly to meet any expectations set by my job and call out anyone who points it out, because they're being disrespectful.
---
feelings are subjective. responsibilities, a job, aren't.
---
you know i once tried duping.. in diablo 1. i to this day have no idea how i heard about it or learned what to do. but i do remember dropping the gold and picking up the potion off the hotbar at the right time and having it work.
---
i just didn't find it to be an interesting activity other than trying the glitch for novelty. i already got it out of my system with game genie on the nintendo, i guess.
---
Strangely for lvl214...I don‚Äôt really have top o the line weapons.  No good bites on market or bazaar when I post but I get by üòâ
---
It‚Äôs probably just not high enough on their priority list 
---
:((  Good thing is they‚Äôve been listening and addressing issues all this time so hopefully it will be taken care of soon üí™
---
Must been leftover from Valentines day.
---
I just played for about an hour and a half and I can confirm no, no you do not. That mod is essential.
---
I mean, you're not wrong. They should have spent more time on it before the release, I agree. Or said it wasn't a finished product, or left it in beta for a year while they figured out the bugs. But sitting around bashing on Bethesda at every turn no matter what they try to fix or add or who they try to please or help isn't getting us anywhere. This was supposed to be a post about new content, not about how bethesda screwed up something else. There's plenty of threads for that to be sure.
---
Maybe you can fix the problem of being banned because I picked up a bag of junk. Theives
---
Like...I'm an active player. I've got a fair few hundred hours in. The idea that everyone who talks badly about this game hates it without reason and/or is in on a conspiracy theory is...literally fucking insane to my mind. 
---
This company has made some serious missteps. Some of them actual, literal, crimes. This game has had some very serious problems. 
---
People on youtube "report on those facts" sometimes in less than nice ways, because...that's what they do? 
---
*As of always.
---
Ah yes. I should waste one of my limited number of perks to not being instantly obliterated at any time by an over powered alpha strike. What perk?
---
Bloodied. With adrenal it‚Äôs like 300% gun damage 
---
Right with you up to the point it explicitly states melee weapons.
---
is there any official statement on this?
---
Any word on the compass in Power Armor not displaying targets correctly.  They‚Äôre still a bit to the right of where they should be. 
---
That's because when you're running at 20% health one vs 15 super mutants one shot is kind of expected.
---
Keep it upgraded to the highest level you can, keep a high strength, and use incisor and  crit hits and it for sure can. 
---
It's the main armament for my main character. 
---
You wont be one shotting skortchbeadts but a mid 30's player? No problem. 
---
Agree to disagree, kiddo ;)
---
Nah man that's how they did it in ancient Rome 
---
But...I just like being on real, green grass sometimes...
---
I know there‚Äôs no correct answer to this (except maybe, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs my life and this is what I want to do with it‚Äù), but at some point perhaps we might ask WHY someone would spend this much time and effort to hoard ammo. 
---
Not use ammo. 
---
Not trade ammo. 
---
Just make and hoard it. 
---
Per 900 hour guy, there was no team involved. 
---
One imagines that taking on however many SBQs a day is going to use up some ammo, right?
---
If that‚Äôs just what he wanted to do, cool beans.  Sucks that you were banned.  Have you tried any of those clicker games?  They might scratch the giant number itch.  
---
Lmao you‚Äôre right he‚Äôs crying everywhere
---
Mostly because I want to play solo and I don't really care about saving 3,300 caps that badly.
---
I do however expect it to work when I pay that much for it.
---
Gun Smith help with durability as well. 
---
Does 'another account' change anything? I don't think so. He's still hoarding 400k bullets right? What if a duper is hoarding a thousand tse of every type spread over a thousand mule accounts? Does he not deserve a ban?
---
Does it STAY "back"? Or can you "lose" it again?
---
I saw a couple things about the Nuka Girl Rocket Suit, but not what I was looking for... I‚Äôve been having an issue where I put it on and my Marine Armor chest piece can still be seen over it, which makes it look really silly. Was this addressed as well?
---
Yes, I killed 6 scorchbeasts, the Grafton monster, and a couple of deathclaws and have been stuck on 4/5 since the 4th kill. 
---
I think you‚Äôre making a lot of baseless assumptions about how process in software dev works, and passing judgement on an organization based on no familiarity with their work, decision making or responsibility handling. 
---
It also sounds like you‚Äôve watched too many episodes of the apprentice and concluded all organizations work like that. 
---
1. I work with software teams as part of my job. They all differ in these respects, and you‚Äôre utterly ignorant, as am I, about how Bethesda‚Äôs holds together. You‚Äôre not in a position to pass judgement. 
---
2. I won‚Äôt succeed at educating you that the world doesn‚Äôt hang together using assholedom. Really; I won‚Äôt. If you think that getting a person in Bethesda, or your kid, or your partner or friend or whoever, do anything better can only be done by behaving like a total asshole to these people, you‚Äôll probably go to sleep tonight still believing that. I won‚Äôt sway you. 
---
But do know, there is a very large part of the world that sees you coming from that place, and quietly tags you as a juvenile.
---
Because... all evidence shows treating anyone like that doesn‚Äôt make **anything** better.
---
‚ÄúBeatings will continue until morale improves‚Äù is a philosophy that doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
Because not everyone participates in the buy/sell forums?
---
"**I don't want to spend hours walking around the map looking for 3 minutes of content I want to play."**
---
I suspect the general concept was to lure in players who would already be wandering around the map exploring &amp; wouldn't otherwise intentionally pursue team play. I'm primarily a solo player &amp; used to previous Fallout games where extended periods of time were spent aimlessly wandering and exploring the map. 
---
"What about that VOX syringer quest? I've seen people talk about the quest in videos, but I've never been able to find it."  
---
Head to [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Monongah](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Monongah) (or google if you want more specifics, but I'm avoiding spoiler-y things here ;)  
---
"Bases are still being griefed for some or no reason, **AND YOU MADE IT WORSE. NOW** **GRIEFERS CAN NOW TELL WHO'S BASE THEY'RE DESTROYING."**
---
I'm overjoyed about this change. I put time into trying to make my CAMP visually appealing, entertaining, useful to other players, and attempting to locate it in places where other people might stumble across it during regular gameplay. Occasionally I come back to discover that somebody liked it and left me a paper bag "tip" of various items. Similarly, any time I find another CAMP that I enjoy, I leave them a bag. But I'm not going to leave a huge amount of valuable stuff in a bag, cuz I have no idea whether the person will stop by "home" again before logging out.   
---
Yes, seeing the name of somebody else's base could open up problems with griefers, but it also makes it possible for me to find the person and give them a "tip" of something awesome, or potentially even talk to them about a cool thing that they built in-game. I'll be much more likely to seek out random strangers that way...  
---
I've never gotten a "Your CAMP is being attacked!" notification a la workshops.  
---
"The other problem is still with event loot. We have no idea what we're running events for, in the rare instances where we can find the events."  
---
I run them primarily for CAMP plans. But it does get frustrating getting the same ones a bajillion times &amp; having no idea whether I've gotten them all or might get other ones by repeating them. 
---
  
---
Yeah exactly. I'm not stating that these people know for a fact that this specific weapon is duped.   
---
I'm stating that I, personally, find it hard to believe the argument that's going around (and I thought you were putting forward, as part of the issue?) that a lot of these trades are to recipients who _don't know about the problem at all_. 
---
They don't have a known method of tracking trades...but these weapons are clones. "XxXDickedyourMomXxX known duper traded a TSE shotgun to 666grief4capslol666" probably isn't something they can do. 
---
"RandomplayerXx5" has a level 45 TSE shotgun, with this exact list of mods, And this exact same random third legendary (I don't actually know the exact specs of the meta guns...I never shopped for them) like five thousand other duped copies of the exact same shotgun? That would be pretty easy. 
---
They are super slow good luck man. I did the canvas bag ticket got it accepted in few days, said they would give me the 500 atoms in few days, waited 2 months of me replying if they are still giving it or what. They eventually replied and emailed me they were giving the 500 atoms now. Didn't get the atoms until few days later lol. Feel like snail mail is faster then them. They reply to bugs/etc tickets really fast though. So, I think their support is selective on what is priority while everything else is on the ignore until later list. They could also be pulling the EA support where this guy was trying get a refund and got told he can't and runarounds until 24hrs was up were he couldn't refund it.
---
It‚Äôs a crap show, at this point.  Bethesda more than likely instituted a counting system to catch people in the act of duping with the board trick.  some time over the weekend, some genius  in Austin figured they could use this counting system to inventory ban people.   But it counts every item they ever picked up, and they‚Äôve inadvertently banned a lot of innocent people.
---
Also, they ask that you don‚Äôt call it a ban.   It‚Äôs only a suspension .  Which is just more horse crap.  If I masturbate with my left hand, it‚Äôs still called a handy.
---
Their ban/suspension boilerplate email goes on to say that there is no appeal, but promises to reinstate people once they‚Äôve fixed the duping issue.  
---
But that promise is nothing more than another punchline in this ongoing joke.  Listen, this game is more full of duping holes than Diablo Ii has when it was released almost 20 years ago.  For every dupe method they patch, two more will crop up, because any monkey capable of banging coconuts together can figure out a way to dupe items.
---
But when they fix that one thing, which is probably the old method of crafting boards, they‚Äôll reinstate everybody, and everybody will gladly come back.
---
Which is wishful thinking.  In two days, Anthem will go live, and this game will be a distant memory.  In fact, with its recent support for modern systems, it is a solid bet that Diablo Ii will outsell Fallout 76 this year. 
---
No.
---
Next topic.
---
They should. That's an outrageous price. 
---
Yeah, If I do it its because you locked your turrets shot at me. 
---
I drink a lot, as I play Fallout during my time off work; but I know for a fact that I did the 3 different things or whatnot in order to complete this quest.  However, I do not have this in my 'completed quests' area of my pipboy.  It bugs me so much not knowing if I completed it or not, but if that is true I should be able to load the quest and finish it.  Not the case, mayor of Grafton has nothing to say and just repeats his Jack-in-the-box dialogue.  Maybe I broke the game or am in the midst of a bug?  Just sharing my experience is all.  Wish y'all the best, or opposite of my play-through
---
PSN - Wolfmandingo - just over level 100 - help me acquire a nice explosive weapon maybe?  accidentally sold me favorite gun, furious gatling
---
it's even more wrong if you have the text mod, as you can consistently add new players that are actively farming SBQ. When i was playing, every night, i would could have at least done SBQ 10 times in an hour if i were to teleport fast enough before the server hit full.   
---
and this is at least 10 times in an hour. I know it's possible to farm it faster, and it was even faster before beth nurfed TSE. Do note, that farming sbq in rapid succession does not equate to getting more violet flux (i was selling calibrated exca legs since i had the plans... before every plan were in the shops). The fastest method for me was sbq1, farm flux, miss sbq2, stop around 40 violet flux's, hit sbq3, pray it's not the same server, farm more, or server hop, repeat. i was getting around that many within a 20 minute period; along with 2 sb's. 
---
You are, because there is no such system. 
---
"in association with another account" could simply mean he has someone on his friend list who dupes. With 900 hours played I'm sure he has some people on his friends list he barely knows or talks to. "In association" is extremely vague we have no idea what Bethesda means. Maybe Bethesda is doubling down on his ban because he moved a large amount of ammo and had someone on his friends list who dupes so they think it's a clear cut case when it's not. 
---
Blocker at level 21 in Strength. I was over exaggerating with the "most". Rank 3 is 45% which will easily take you out of any one shot a mid 30s player can pull off. And it isn't a waste by any means. Like half the enemies in the game are mellee. 
---
Besides, yes, it's a choice to spend those completely infinite and switchable perk cards on something that will protect you. Just like you can choose to spend them on damage cards or crafting cards or weight reduction cards. 
---
I did with goats perk card and 2 acrobats shoes, barely lost hp. Was a lot of fun lol, so dam high.
---
Power attacks already do an increased amount of damage, why can't that be the one-shot button?
---
Lucky you. I can't maintain a connection to save my life today. 
---
Not that I‚Äôve seen. But I‚Äôve tested it and did a write up here once. Timed stuff with and without power armor, with emergency protocols etc
---
This system is just f'd up. What advantage do I (a LVL 200) vs a lvl 60 when we both have the same amount of perk spots, perk points, base health/dmg/ap according to perk points. But they warrant an extra 150caps for winning? Where is the logic Bethesda?
---
Why should I have to limit myself to that kind of playstyle? I'm a power armour wielding rifleman, who carries no underarmour to save weight for scavenging.
---
I don't need my TSE anymore now the games balanced, but I'm not going to feel bad for not giving myself a chance to enjoy the game. I may be "dishonest", but at least I'm not so jaded to think I'm some paragon of what's fair. 
---
This unfortunately is not a matter of ethics(but it is kinda). You agreed to a terms of service when you played the game. If you violate the agreement you agreed too, you give up your rights to the product. 
---
Are you on PC? I can dig up something cool for you to kick around with
---
That's sad üò¢
---
I had just now gotten disconnected then disconnected 5x now trying to get back in.
---
So i guess i was lucky to be able to play today.
---
Sony was "okay" with crossplatform about a month before release. Not enough time to add it before release.
---
Not to mention crossplatform takes time to integrate. Would you rather they fix problems with the game or spend time adding crossplatform?
---
I think some people in the past had this glitch. Feel like bugs affect certain people and not others like some in the past couldn't use power armor because they would get stuck.
---
RemindME! Two weeks
---
&gt;‚ÄúBeatings will continue until morale improves‚Äù is a philosophy that doesn‚Äôt work.
---
I beg to differ. especially considering the level of incompetence in this case extrapolated any and every justifiable level. but like you pointed out, this discussion isn't going anywhere. you obviously align with left-leaning ideas and I, well, you get the idea.
---
They have said it in their forums regarding their previous games years ago. I tried to Google find it, but results have only shown me people talking about supers in F076
---
And modders do know how bethseda tracks things. The item tracker isnt server sided, its client side. It's been like that in all games running this engine. This includes the TES and Fallout series. This one you can confirm yourself by checking the wiki, or going to Nexus and looking at modders resource tools, or asking previous modders. 
---
Bethesdas engine can not trace where you got none unique items, nor how many you have. In your inventory, code wise, you only ever have 1 of each item, and that item can be used X times. Meaning from a program's point of view, having 100 bullets means you have 1 bullet that can be used 100 times. 
---
Don't hold your breath.  This is the same company that launched a buggy mess, shipped out nylon bags when they promised canvas in a collector's edition, and every patch they reintroduce old bugs they already fixed along with new game breaking bugs.
---
They can't do anything right.  I'm sure the ban wave is powered by the world's worst PL/SQL written by an unpaid intern and wasn't code reviewed before going to production and has some horrible joins causing row duplication or the forgot to exclude items already owned previously by the player.  It's the Bethesda way.
---
Love the Fallout series, but man is FO76 an absolute joke when it comes to product quality.  Every patch they prove they can't develop software.  I'd have been fired by now.  I call out third party vendors for trash like this and would want legal to review SLAs, and I'll work with them if they need help, but I won't install garbage in my environments.
---
Melee is WAY overpowered and more then the tses where at this point, the issue with the tse was the stacking of bobbleheads and magazines and chems and mutations all at once. I won't spend a dollar on this game and haven't played it but maybe a few hours in the past 3 weeks. The durability or lack there of in guns and the fact they are now like shooting bb guns at things
---
When my HP is lowered my damage is not increased....
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asikrw/free_mutation_serums_for_anyone_affected_by_the/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
The gauss rifle isn‚Äôt a Gatling fun though. Not sure why nerfing those types of weapons would change this one
---
No to be fair TSE‚Äôs were wayyyy more overpowered than melee.
---
Ikr, hence why pvp is pointless; and those low lvl turds that try to farm caps on people with workshops that are higher lvl are scum.
---
Cause when my hp is lowered from 100%, my damage is not increased ...
---
The if people want to believe daft stuff go for it but threads like this need stopping. If it happened anywhere else there would be bans.
---
it *could* be a bug, then. especially because my speed bonuses tend to break at random.

Using cheats or a trainer is LOADS of fun for about an hour. Hence why most dupers would either:
---
- give things away 
---
- hog kills/grief people farming Whitesprings
---
- Sell the things for cash
---
When you have even 1000 of every mat, there is no reason to leave your camp. When you can trade 10k nuka colas for some gun you want, there is no reason to farm legendaries. 
---
These people are damning themselves by sucking *their own fun* out of the game and getting their dumbasses banned. RIP.
---
If you wanna cheat get a R* game (for consoles) or use the console in a singleplayer game. Jedi Outcast had best console, imo. Man, getting that dismemberment code to work was a BITCH though. 
---
Great ideas!
---
Historically I've been the kind of person who would spend real life money on silly avatars and etc... and in theory I still am, but I haven't gotten excited about very much of the existing shop content. 
---
Pretty happy overall but (sheds solemn tear) how I‚Äôll miss ye, beneficial rad worms. Now I‚Äôll have to start using the drinking fountain again ;-)
---
Enjoy spending your life on your slave ship. Or prison. Or wherever it is you work. 
---
You know what software teams that behave like that are called? 
---
They are called software teams that no good developer will work for. Not one software dev team thinks like that. And your strong belief in that tells me you don't come from the software world.
---
have you checked out the filthy casuals page yet?
---
Pete Hines actually responded to this before he went dark. He said "You mean why haven't we worked on a feature that wasn't even announced until the beta was underway? There are other features being worked on before this" this wasn't the exact response but it was the gist
---
Matches my experience today pretty much... It's been completely unplayable every time I tried today. 
---
Your lucky he didn't attempt to attack your workshop and farm you for ton caps, because getting wanted doesn't the victim lose less caps compared to pvp deaths?
---
HAHAHA
---
I killed that last week it worked. I killed it this week and nope.
---
Yup. Griefers are the second biggest issue this game has, after the bugs. 
---
So others can dictate how I play but I cant dictate how others play. Nice contradiction there, and I have the small iq.
---
Stupid morons
---
I can make my own, but you can confirm it doesnt break after relogs?
---
On forum one person had received an email listing only somethng like 140k plastic. Don't take the "rare" too literally.
---
They don't accept screenshots as proof of anything. The point is that you *cannot* realistically prove a negative.
---
It's like nobody in BGS team working on the game had any foresight to see how so many game mechanics would be taken advantage of or so naive to believe everyone would play the game as 1 big happy loving community
---
God Howard givith, God howard taketh away.
---
Why this sub thinks brigading is acceptable behaviour to take part in I don‚Äôt know.
---
Oh damn, I didn't hear that Sony finally wised up and realized we are different systems living in the same world. 
---
I've heard that some Atomic Shop cosmetics will increase a player's health significantly for a time period of 7 days? Is that really the case? If so, that will make the whole "cosmetic only" microtransaction moot and effectively a lie.
---
Pretty much my standing position at this point, not gonna lie.
---
I think you're mistaking the meaning of the word griefing
---
I dunno, I assume your ok as you don't sound banned but its a mess 
---
But that's all 'maybe's and nothing is certain at this point. I get your point and concerns but we are both assuming and this ain't going anywhere. What is certain is that those accounts banned are his main and secondary accounts and none of his friends was involved. You are taking unnecessary extra steps here
---
It does grow by level. =\]
---
This bug effect people w/o blooded builds?
---
lmao did you just watch yong's video, because that happened like two≈∫three weeks ago
---
Did he mention that Bethesda's response to feedback for that week was "we thought it was fine since there's costumes in the game that worked, but we'll be more careful in the future"
---
Yep, sadly this challenge is bugged.
---
Do it to me once, kill me or I kill you, and we move on if someone wants to move on. That‚Äôs cool. It‚Äôs called griefing when one of the players refuses to let up and continues to harass. 
---
No, Im saying I dont take it that far but Ive had my base leveled twice and it led to the most fun hours of my gameplay. Im saying its a part of the game thats under appreciated. 
---
Good post, I agree completely I so don‚Äôt want PVP,  personally I wish contesting a workshop would give the option ‚Äúrequest to team up‚Äù and give us a basic team builder that way 
---
The VOX mission is started near a house north east of the Montogah  power plant. 
---
How is that griefing though?
---
I assume its because of my playstyle but as far as me being banned in Fallout, not going to happen, but thanks! :)
---
Worst part i got my friend involved and he is banned also! Smfh.
---
No amount of paying could make you a winner, now go find a bridge to be under.
---
I thought last week's weekly was to kill 5? This week looks like you just have to kill one. Or am I stupid lol
---
Yes, no, maybe, I don't know
---
I know :D
---
Fusion generator
---
Everyone has been posting about this for the past eight hours. It‚Äôs broken. Everyone knows it‚Äôs broken. 
---
Well by that logic I can only carry 250 .50 Cal rounds but realistically 2 bullets should kill anything at that point
---
Naa Xbox...the tse shotty is still workable, it‚Äôs my lvl 40 F/Ex/negDmg assault rifle that I miss the ex dmg on the most...used to 2 shot everything: tap-tap....tap-tap, now takes 5-6 shots of Betsy...my only decent weapon drop that I‚Äôve used since lvl 60 lol
---
This is literally how YouTube works too. Honestly this is how most platforms work, so they don't get bad publicity, because at the end of the day, its a company that makes money from consumers, that's it. 
---
Wow that escalated quickly. He wants to end this convo and you call him a kid because he doesn't agree with you or have the same views? Sorry bud but you sound like the childish one here. Coveted, even. Life just doesn't run the way you want it buddy. You must get a lot of sand in that crack... 
---
I also don't agree with you at all btw. We have a right to complain &amp; be vocal about it. It's our right as consumers. It's our money they're laughing all the way to the bank with.
---
You have the right to your opinion/ideals &amp; thought but don't try to shove 'em down our throats.
---
What about snipers?
---
One shot.....one kill. 
---
Isn't that what the snipers motto is?
---
Yes thats how I play but its the apocalypse, there are going to be bad guys. 
---
Okay, so Bethesda DIDN'T say that about Fallout 76 and modders know stuff about other games but not this one specifically. Also nobody has any idea what they can track server-side except people with access/working for them. 
---
Gotcha. 
---
You could be right, but your "evidence" isn't as solid as you seem to think it is. Just like all the people who said they had no way to track people using exploits at all and they were absolutely certain, until the first ban wave hit.
---
What is also concerning is YongYea's lack of discussion on how minimal the +60 hp bonus is, and how relatively easy it is to gain atomic points. (if you don't play a lot then you won't get atomic points, but if the outfit is exclusive to a week long in-game event, you also won't get it.) He and many other youtubers have already made video about a false rumor of fo76 going free to play and profited from speculations and rumors. I doubt his intention is that noble that he simply wants to bring awareness. Also, by focusing on such insignificant bonus gained for a short period of time, he is drumming up more speculations among his viewers who don't play the game and who don't any research. He could be more responsible do a more objective video with a less clickbait title but that won't get his views. You can do a well researched and objective video about a potential issue, but the bethesda hate train is strong so YongYea is gonna capitalize on that by finding any little issue to complaint about.
---
when skyrim was new i played through the game to completion 284 hours in 28 days while working a full time job... 900 hours in 3 months is not a stretch lol
---
Oh no I‚Äôm fine, only thing I‚Äôm having a problem with is a Bankruptcy fine giving me 50% less damage to players...which seems extremely unbalanced if someone wanted to pvp me.
---
Well the dress from the Mysteries quest was available to use for free and was included in the Unstoppable costumes list. 
---
Yup, Bethesda certainly has that list of "30 guns" and those were the targets of the de-dupe a couple weeks back.
---
I think you imagine the trading discord to be a den of iniquity, full of dupers. The fact of the matter id the majority of folks in there are not like that. Most of the big time traders that I knew to have stocks of duped weapons are mostly gone. They left after the de-dupe and weight limit patch.  Now it's a few big time players, lots of part time traders (like me), and a heck of a lot fewer duped items.  The market has actually started to level out some as well. TSE guns flew into the market after the nerf, you could pick them up for a few thousand caps. Now the market is starting to level off and now that the market is no longer saturated the prices are going back up. It's a pretty neat example of supply and demand and Bethesdas tactics seem to have worked for the most part despite all the grumbling you see in this reddit.
---
Are your workshops stolen regularly? 
---
In the entire time I've been playing on PS4 I can only remember anyone trying to take one of my workshops a few times. 
---
No, they need to introduce more options/legendaries/perks to make ranged weapons equally viable. Obviously guns shouldn't do 2000 per shot but they could stand to be much better than they are.
---
Nerfs are boring and lame, buffs are fun and good.
---
 I Melee always do more dps. It was always too true build. TSE was a faster build and easier build. Also with bobblehead stacking you could out dps Melee.
---
But bloodied Melee was number 1 dps build since beta.
---
No one was complaining two weeks ago and all of sudden everyone complains because Yong said something about it? Brah
---
I'm a 'super' mutant, I'm not afraid of those things. ;o
---
You ever tried a sneak attack crit with an Instigating modifier?
---
Thanks for sharing that.
---
I've heard from others that the big apparently comes back after you take another serum. That is very generous of that player.
---
who?
---
Speaking of a soap box.... you're standing on a damn pallet of the stuff.
---
Please, just stop being such a hypocrite and move on with your life.
---
Do you take Rad-X? Rad-X suppresses mutation effects.
---
Word is, once they can remove the duped stuff and patch the exploit, people will be unsuspend. Thank you BTW for owning up to what you did.
---
Sure does.
---
And this is his second post!
---
No doubt. But people do pay it.
---
Love this update, really shows that Bethesda isn‚Äôt just going to abandon this game at its earliest convenience.
---
Lame paint...
---
I have scraped TONS of combat helmets how do you get it
---
A lot of the items seem to stay in the store after the event associated with them ends. Which lights? Is it the kill, laugh love one? If so, that's still in the store
---
My point is that people are cheating in the game, by duping anything and everything. You were saying that people wouldn't bother duping ammo, which I disagree with specifically.
---
It doesn't matter why they are cheating, or even it was slower leveling then playing the game normally. They should be banned.
---
But what you're describing isn't griefing, mate
---
You are 100% right. But sometimes due to the poor balance and implementation the bad guys can one hit you and follow you around the map and servers if they feel like it. Sure, it‚Äôs very raiderly to want to kill for no reason, but it can be abused in ways that PvE ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù do not.
---
i finally found the stupid thing on a roof in harpers ferry.
---
&gt;  without the jetpack its almost not worth using. 
---
 Gotta disagree with you there.  I think it's the most overrated mod out there.  In game like this, the greatest power armor benefit comes from calibrated shocks. Having them in both legs increases carry weight by 100. 
---
I have calibrated shocks for my Ultracite armor.   Had to pay someone caps to build them though because the plans are a drop from the queen that almost never drops. 
---
lol. fixed.  I have a future again.
---
I'm saying this as general advice, not a solution to this issue, buy your serums on one of the trading subreddits. They're like 500 caps max.
---
Not that often. I usually have 2-3 workshops taken while I'm on. Occasionally, I'll have a pair try to take one from me and pvp. A few times people tried to take one without really knowing whatsl's going on?
---
&gt; instigating lever action 
---
That's the new best legendary (for everyone who thinks trying to stay below 20% health is stupid).
---
The Problem is re-asserting itself after either one hour, or until a (certain?) disease hits. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten all of my best leggies from nuked whitesprings. 
---
Your honesty is admirable. 
---
He‚Äôs been crafting ammo, obviously. 
---
eh , at least you aren't doing a giant rant , here take a upvote . my guess is relatively soon folks will get unbanned but I'm just a nooblet so I might be far off in my estimation of how they are prioritizing things .
---
you mod your combat helmet. it's a paint mod
---
Oh boy, here we go. I wanted to wait an hour in game to see what happened when the negative effect suppression wore off from the serums. The results are very odd for me - your results may vary.
---
First and foremost, here is a screenshot of my effects tab now: [https://imgur.com/TjoDPHX](https://imgur.com/TjoDPHX)
---
As you can see, the effects tab still does not display the positive effects of the Adrenal Reaction mutation. What's odd, though, is that I still seem to be benefiting from the positive effects. This threw me for a loop though - my damage is actually HIGHER now than it was before the patch!
---
I run a low health build, so I spent a few minutes playing with my rads to go over and under the Nerd Rage threshold and logging out and back in each time. I did this because I remembered the exact damage values of two weapons - one Bloodied and one not Bloodied when I was below 20% health prior to today's patch. I was pleasantly surprised when both numbers were actually higher under the same circumstances (same health value, same perks, same mutations)
---
Furthermore, I did not notice a different between, say, 19% health and 12% health prior to the patch. My two different weapons showed 534 and 881 damage from 19% health down to 1%. Now they are showing different damage numbers based on my health value - 595/991 at 19% health, increasing as my health gets lower. I have no idea where the extra 11.4% damage came from at 19% health, nor why I'm now getting different damage values with every % change in health.
---
I definitely need to do some more testing on this, but I'm about to head out for birthday dinner. I'll hop on later tonight or tomorrow to play around a bit more.
---
There are many ways to complain. 
---
Toxic cynicism is one of them. 
---
Being an asshole isn't illegal. Nobody is taking our right to be an asshole away. We're not challenging your legal rights here, or suggesting that treating anyone like an asshole (him-&gt; bethesda, him-&gt; others here, me-&gt;him, whoever) is outside of our rights. 
---
I'm suggesting we shouldn't do it, because it 
---
a. It achieves nothing (except giving whoever is behaving that way some emotional instant relief). 
---
and
---
b. There may or may not be people who worked hard for what you have, and it does actually cut. Bad juju. Seriously. Don't. 
---
You don't need the goat legs perk if you have two acrobat armor pieces. Together they negate 100% of fall damage.
---
Scrapping more helmets sadly. 
---
I know that but how do you get tge paint mod
---
I could be wrong but I think this is meant for IRL travel and not in-game use. Unless that's what you meant and then I apologize.
---
its useful to now where not to go farming for junk/mobs if someone is already there.
---
Shoot first‚Ä¶ ask questions lat‚Äî wait, what? Bonuses?
---
Dang ok thanks 
---
I too read articles!
---
I think he needs to show us on this doll where Bethesda touched him 
---
Oh, so you‚Äôre just an asshole. 
---
You could try swapping the splitter for a beam focuser. The splitter doesn‚Äôt add any damage (maybe +1 dmg), so it isn‚Äôt worth the extra hits to durability.
---
Don‚Äôt use the sniper barrel without knowing how it charges. It has three small lights on its barrel that dim when you shoot once. They light up one by one to indicate charge level. You charge it by not shooting. No need to hold the trigger or do anything. If you shoot rapidly, it does much less than even a normal barrel per shot. Also, any reflex sight or scope blocks view of these lights. Yeah. Super dumb! 
---
Got it from scrapping combat armor pieces. not the helmet
---
Please go to bed, kids like you need to be in school not playing a game which is meant for adults. 
---
Oh wow i will try that
---
that's very awesome of you 
---
Yea boss, if you walk up to him after the event and "talk" to him, you get a timed xp bonus or something to that effect.
---
&gt; Bethesda would still have to penalize wanted people that store their caps
---
The solution to that issue is pretty simple. Their wanted status doesn't get cleared until they actually lose that many caps. If they die and can't cover the bounty then they get the PvP damage debuff until they do clear their bounty. That's how it should be anyway.
---
They do their thing, you do yours. Which is crying I guess
---
I‚Äôm as troubled by the crying as I amid the sanctimonious soapboxing.  They both hit my gag reflex with equal force
---
It's a shame for you to blame, just for the fame, when other just playing the game. 
---
Even diffrent hair styles.
---
so your an asshole. makes sense from your username though. Mods ban him here too. we have lost many, whats 1 more gonna hurt?
---
Thanks, saved.
---
Banned for duping said ammo. 
---
Yup.
---
Been using an instigating lever rifle. I was dropping level 68 Super Mutants with a 1 sneak headshot with level 3 covert operative and 5 rifleman perks..... without adrenal reaction it's taking 2 shots now.
---
Of course my point was that it's perfectly acceptable to want to one shot with a deathclaw when you have 20% health....... especially if someone sitting in a tree across the map with full health wants to one shot 
---
To my knowledge scaly skin doesn‚Äôt work at all. We can all save one serum to be made. Unless they fixed it. 
---
I am. 
---
Some people have said they‚Äôve got the paint from scraping the armor too, which is weird. A little believable since the game is still buggy.
---
It was dropping 8 per play and isn't insistence as such just wait anyone who doesn't take the reward is giving it to some one else for free.  
---
Think I got 32 when I did the quest. 
---
It's often in the Whitesprings clothing shop.
---
 I'm just pointing your cheating was not even necessary, as options exist in the game to do almost any damn thing. As well as being dishonest, its lazy.
---
This is only half true--It will prevent the Southern spawn trigger (Two small bridges). The Northern trigger (Long bridge) still works, as I have gotten the vendor to spawn directly on top of me at the furthest end of the north bridge, and everywhere between the nearest end and train station, with CAMPs at the pond. The trigger is not strictly limited to the southern bridge set, nor does the vendor only spawn directly at the shack - He can pop up in numerous places in the immediate area.
---
no surprises there. the software world as it currently is, is filled with people whose skin is as thin as cotton-candy and can't handle criticism, because then you're sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. take the recent Linux debacle for example, worrying about irrelevant time wasters such as a CoC instead of pushing code. it's funny because you're resorting to name calling, saying I'm a kid, yet people like the ones I just described are the very definition of "juvenile".
---
I'm not American or European for that matter. I come from a place where people want you to get things done. sure the leftist cancer has spread here, but it's contained inside universities. once you're out in the real world, all that crap is dropped and you either fall in line and meet your quota or you're out of a job. **especially in the software engineering world**.
---
I'm a psychologist. but I dipped my toe in the software world during my teens and even I couldn't handle the pressure, how hard they pushed developers. the ungodly expectations literally every single company had for us. and everyone seemed happy to oblige, not even once bringing up their feelings and how much they hurt.
---
so yeah. Rockstar wasn't so lenient with their employees and look how RDR2 turned out. whipping does work, too.
---
Yeah thats what another guy said
---
Kudos for being upfront. Have an upvote 
---
No he ‚Äúcrafted‚Äù it. 
---
No, it is the red and white ones. It was a limited time valentines item that is no longer there. For reference they look like the white ones currently in there but with alternating red bulbs.
---
nope.
---
An hour? Could this be because you're inducing it using a serum?
---
If this is the case, maybe worth picking it up organically?
---
Yes. Here's the damage of one weapon (note radiation/health):

Maybe you can investigate your source code that was originally written in the 1990s
---
That's your power attack button as your one-shot. You think power attacks should be worthless? Also just logged in and while adrenal reaction is bugged I'm one shotting muties no problem
---
Waaah waaah I suck in pvp, pls nerf it!
---
dude, i busted my L2 vertebra, and i still jump.  
---
Its time for us ranged guys to do the same courtesy to melee users. Everyone cry for the nerfs! Also yes, melee is stupidly OP, and anybody saying otherwise is just blinded by greed and power.
---
I think so.  I was an alcoholic and just didn't do anything about it and it went away after some time. 
---
yes, it affects adrenal reaction specifically. doesn't matter if you have a bloodied weapon to go with it.
---
Sounds like ur the sensitive one
---
When I added you it showed a different name. I joined a party with what I thought was you and he didn't have plans?
---
I was just wondering the same thing I just got rid of mine and got it bag I'll relog shortly and test cause I can make mine too
---
No they don‚Äôt, you need an addictol.
---
I dont understand what the outrage is here. You were using a secondary account just to store objects, thats obviously an exploit of the game unless I'm confused. Do you really think Bethesda intended for players to he able to have infinite storage capacity by trading it with other accounts?
---
This. Idk why people get all worked up over pvp. Why i quit playing. I‚Äôm ok playing single player games or strictly co-op but if you put me in a server with a bunch of other guys lagging my shit I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to fight other people. Play not online games if you wanna be safe from ‚Äúbullies‚Äù
---
If you ignore them, yeah.
---
Yeah, but after getting to level 275 over winter vacation, and now only being able to spend maybe 3-4 hours a week playing, the codes being posted like that is incredibly useful as there is no way i could possibly get 8 codes of a single type, with three seperate codes (24 in total) every single week to launch a nuke, the effort wouldnt even be worth it because there isn‚Äôt anything in those nuke zones that i even need aside from higher level enemies and the queen. Believe me, i understand that it‚Äôs probably annoying to you that people give out the codes while you work on solving them on your own, but why shouldnt they, the game was built specifically to have a fan base and the entirety of the end game revolves around ever changing codes, with rarely spawning enemies that occasionally give codes that overlap, one for the wrong silo, or just straight up not give you anything at all, people are gonna just give out the code. Its not even an exploit because youre SUPPOSED to do it with friends, the whole issue isnt even close to any of the previous exploits, like infinite hp, no rad damage, duplication of items, and even straight up instant killing enemies by using 30-40 bobbleheads, the games already incredibly grindy, especially with the bethesda team reducing damage and making items break faster. Its entirely a non-issue.
---
They don't.
---
 There is no paint for excavator so far.
---
Ok so is there something I need to do to fix it or is there a hotfix coming soon?
---
not yet, though it was confirmed excavator paint is coming
---
Zero. Why? Three star stuff is probably 95% duped stuff.  Sure there are decent legendaries for sale/trade not duped,  but the TSE is one of the rarest drops and shouldn't have half the player base with one.  This is why people get bored only after a month of playing.  Overpowered armor and weapons are easy to trade/buy with duped stuff all over the place. Once you've got that god weapon you can farm the hard areas for better than average drops (but probably not anywhere as good as the dupe you bought). But even those weapons should be banned because they were obtained using cheat weapons.
---
How to fix it without half your base crying "Wah ! TSE gone! wah! I worked hard earning caps to buy that TSE! I'm a poor innocent player just doing what Bethesda wants! Trading with others! and now I lost my TSE I fairly traded for..."
---
This part of the game is broken and needs to be fixed.  When anyone has a TSE I already assume it's a dupe via the grey market (whether you were the one buying it or was given it it's still stolen property).  I heard some early dupers were just handing out scads of TSE shotguns and the like to random people. Crazy.
---
How Bethesda is going to take away duped weapons is a mystery to me.  A lot of people think they have legit claim to duped stuff because they paid caps for stolen goods.  These are stolen goods. Bethesda never intended for weapon dupes and any copy is an unauthorized and thereby stolen copy which should result in surrender of duped weapon with no warning.  Bethesda is not banning players forever, they are actually leaving one copy for everyone - doesn't fix the problem, but slows down the dupers until they can generate more with the one copy they were left with.  
---
What Bethesda should be doing is tagging every three star legendary so they can follow the trail from origin (when/where dropped and picked up by whom) and when dupe erase time happens, they all dissappear without any wah! wah! because no innocent mistakes can be made.
---
You can check on your pipboy, there's a "effect" tab that lists all of your current buffs with timers on them.

---
With full anyeilding armor and bloodied melee I could probably 1 shot just about anyone who didn't buy a full set of sentinel off e-bay, so why don't you go troll elsewhere.
---
A sword through your face wouldn't put you down? 
---
Are you sure? Are you REALLY sure?
---
&gt; Heck, who has 10K of anything in their possession?
---
I think I topped that much steel before at launch. Sure I couldn't fast travel and had to use my AP to move, but I didn't want to drop that stuff.
---
Leftist cancer? 
---
funny thing is more than half the player base plays with low health on purpose now. so pretty much a useless buff.
---
Well they posted a fix that didn't work,  and could potentially cost a lot of players a lot of caps.  Until they at least commit to fixing this, instead of providing a costly solution that solves nothing, we should keep talking about it.
---
no word from Bethesda. users report that, if you get rid of adrenal reaction and then re-acquire it, it should work.
---
but it's easier said than done. I'm the process of reacquiring it myself, will edit the post once I can confirm it works.
---
people who use the term "toxic" unironically, for example.
---
I think so, I think it was that last bit where you finish all of the initial quests (deathclaw syringer super mutants ghouls) and then have to go back to the top of the world.
---
Do you actually have to remove and reapply or can you just take another serum?
---
In power armor? Yep! 
---
A sword should do more damage than a shot gun? Than a minigun? THAN A FREAKING NUCLEAR DETONATION IN YOUR FACE? 
---
Bikes the queen earlier. It got super choppy. Then I got the glitch where I was the size of power armour but naked. Couldn‚Äôt exit my ‚Äúnude power armour‚Äù and lost all my fusion cores. Everything reset back when I rejoined the server but fusion cores were still gone. Also continuous loading screens on most of the creatures in the nuke zone. I did get my SBQ loot though. A plan for a buzz blade :/ and a plan for an electrified something or other. (Another blade)
---
This is true. Happened to me early so I switched my build up but I hear you. 
---
the first step is admitting to it. congrats on your recovery.
---
Nice Ghandi quote, but still dosen't change the fact that the same goes for ranged users whom obtained TSE weapons to use. It takes grinding to do legit, the only other ranged option that comes close is Bloodied, and that requires the same sacrifices a melee users would have to make. 
---
My point is that just as much work, if not more, goes into a viable ranged build, barring the dupers (but that applies  to melee as well.) and is not an excuse to keep melee safe from nerfs.
---
It's really interesting to watch the absolute denial of people on /r/fo76 
---
It's like an abused wife defending the abusive husband. "N- n- no... I just t- tripped and f- f- fell down the stairs! It's my fault, honestly! Bethesda didn't do anything wrong, t- they're good. I mean, e- even if they're not-- and not that they're not-- they could change if they wanted to! I love you Bethesda!"
---
Wonder how many times they have to shit in people's living rooms before they take the hint.
---
Yeah the other counter is vats crits in aware in also aware of the massive ego the sentinel effect gives players did not know that till today.
---
just taking the serum **does not work**. I know that for a fact.
---
I'm still trying to confirm whether removing it and then taking the serum works.
---
Stable is a pound each too. I know because that's what I bring up whenever someone said the stash is fine. If you even want to save up like 60 of each stable flux that was half your stash gone right there.
---
PLEASE READ! 
---
Reacquiring the adrenal reaction mutation fixes until you relog or get disconnected, then it breaks again to negative only. 
---
Please upvote so they could see this.
---
I removed my mutations, bought the serums, reapplied them and everything was ok. I got disconnected and logged back in and it was negative only again.
---
I'm sure you are. You probably also have more points dedicated to rifleman than I do. 
---
Where are we going with this? It seems like you are just trolling.
---
bs explosive can hit multiples at once and so can the explosion from a regular guess rifle
---
It's the apocalypse, shit happens!
---
There's also perks to negate all TSE damage but that didn't stop the nerfs.
---
Don't you find it funny that absolutely no one was calling for this to be fixed or considered it overpowered yet beth went on ahead and took away the one thing that kept gatling guns from being useless? Who cares what the card reads? When you first encountered a gatling gun I KNOW you tried your best to get it firing faster like the firing speed "explicitly" (see wut I did thar). Here we are though. One more nerf to whittle the already low amount of viable ranged weaponry even more. 
---
It would have been easier and made more sense to change the tooltip on the card to include gatling guns. Again, faster swinging speed and faster cranking speed is more than enough to maintain my suspension of disbelief as to why this wasn't an issue
---
Yes. I am sure. Fight that guy with the minigun with your sword. Good luck. 
---
You'll learn why melee being high damage has ties with **BEING MAULED REPEATEDLY BY ANYTHING THAT MOVES.**
---
A sniper rifle, minigun, rocket laucher or anything ELSE you want to list, does not have that danger. 
---
So yeah. A sword in your face should put you down. 
---
At least get the information correct, he didnt remove his post as it would then say deleted not removed, that happens when a sub admin removes the post.
---
He had "aquired" high amounts of ammo, nothing in his post said he currently had that much ammo simply that it was acquired in the last 30 days, this can very well be ammo moved between accounts of his, or duped ammo,  but nothing says it's not just a tally of ammo that's been moved back and fourth added up.
---
The OP posted the reply to his own support ticket showing the ammo, with the explanation that he has moved it, generally the guilty dont follow up there post with stuff that incriminated them unless they honestly feel their was a mistake.  The OP has asked what levels of ammo he has on his account and that he has never had more then 36k of any one ammo type, leading to his thought it was a tally of moved ammo.
---
At least get the information correct instead of repeating what you read on the 4th or 5th thread about his original thread posted today by random people.
---
Whether he did or didnt dupe the ammo or Bethesda screwed up their tracking like they have screwed up so many aspects of this game is yet to be seen and there is no more proof for one scenario or the other, at least for now.
---
Reacquiring the mutation temporarily fixes until you relog. Then it goes back to negative! 
---
You're. 
---
It doesn't go away. It may disappear from your effects tab on your pipboi but the addiction stays unless cured with addictol
---
I used to just destroy all their turrets and have my friend claim my bounty. Fuxk those guys.
---
Just like you can use a Dense mod and the perk Fireproof to negate all explosive damage?
---
I speculate the collection of that many resources would have taken all 900 of his hours. Lol
---
Ah I see. So you only want realism when it suits your argument and "balance" when it suits your argument. I understand now.
---
And a .50 through your chest, center mass wouldn't kill either right? Because right now, it doesn't.
---
Greifing is prolonging an encounter past the point of enjoyment. If I have to disconnect, then your are greifing. If we can fight and walk away amicably afterwatds, then it's just PvP.
---
No I mean with my bloody sledgehammer build. It's like with the TSE nerfs, people were claiming they couldn't one-shot lvl 10 super mutants lol
---
Pipboy even shows "Adrenal Reaction: MAX HP -50".
---
That's it, no positive effect. ;(
---
Bummer. By chance did you join the SBQ fight by using a discord LFG? I seem to have issues when I join a server that isn't in my region.
---
I feel a little bad for the guy, after all he‚Äôs played it for over 900 hours. He must love it and for it to get taken away, I can see why he‚Äôs butt-hurt. 
---
Lol perfect response.
---
Holy shit is this guy behind the eightball. Wait till two weeks from now when he hears about the bans and 900/1000 hour guys.
---
Reacquiring the mutation temporarily fixes until you relog, then its back to negatives
---
I don't know about  Adrenalreaktion , but my Marsupial keeps kicking out for no reason.
---
Play it like a single player game and you will be happy IMO. I am also a new player and that's how I feel so far. It doesn't have the best single player aspects, but the atmosphere is amazing, also may be in the minority with that but just my opinion.
---
I found 30 stimpaks in a container once I was da fuq. 
---
Got this same thing yesterday. Literally found a bag with \~750k Lbs of stuff in it. In a game with resources so scarce sometimes who wouldn't pick it up? Now im a "duper"
---
Fix your game you thieves
---
So what's up with the bitchy post? Please don't lie about your "capabilities". You're most likely running a 1 star Hunter's level 30 shotgun or something crappy. 
---
So, again, "waaah waaah I suck in PVP, pls nerf it".
---
I may actually go after them now instead of running to save ammo and stils
---
Yeah. That's another strategy. You can stack them all too and be a far better tank. Thrown on Barbarian and White Knight too. 
---
Isn't the point of rpg games to make choices where getting better at one skill makes it harder to be good at others? That's like a thing right?
---
Are you... upset? About making other people upset?
---
Do you not see the irony?
---
Wow you just sound butthurt just because I‚Äôm telling you like it is from experience man
---
According to the boilerplate email sent to everyone who submitted a ticket, the ban will end when Bethesda fixes duping.   May as well watch the weather reports, looking for a surprise polar vortex to pass through hell, because any monkey who can bang two coconuts together can figure out how to dupe in this game. 
---
Bethesda has no control over the economy, and are banning people dupers, but also many who were inadvertently affected by their completely naive approach to online economies.  The most egregious dupers are always 5 steps ahead of them at all times, and probably have a guy or two on the inside.  If they really want to hit dupers, right now, they should ban any assclown who has more than 500 ultra-rare outfits, which are currently trading north of 10k caps per.
---
Come to the wrong forum bud. 
---
We‚Äôre all cry babies here . 
---
Is there a way to make them show up again or check that they are still there?  And if it doesn't show up there does it affect junkie's weapons?
---
They really lost some money on this one. One of the only items I'd pay real cash for.
---
I don't know. Do you feel a compulsion to play the game? Can you choose to stop playing the game whenever you want? 
---

I joined via the Xbox game hub. 
---
It‚Äôs actually the first time I got the glitch. But it seems very choppy every time during a SBQ fight. Likely due to the amount of players it brings out. Just happy we killed her this time. 
---
By that reasoning literally everything in this game should one shot everyone.
---
I wasnt banned and have never duped, but with over 30 years gaming I have seen bans done correctly and wrongly.   Bethesdas history suggests they are more likely to screw up then get this correct, they cant even fix minor issues without creating 3 more.
---
Some of the people crying they got banned for sure deserved it, others probably didn't.   But nothing supports any story currently outside of Bethesda having a horrible record with any sort of code implementation. 
---
I play with a ragtag group. We come and go, none of us take the game too seriously. You can join our discord if you want.
---
Good to know. Thanks for the advice. Explains why he was able to do it if he has things added on

Exactly, griefing by definition is not enjoyable, OP has the definition wrong.
---
Let the kiddies have their own play space. You can hang out here with the immature man-childs instead :) 
---
Its amateur year it seems
---
Yeah I'm a gamer, I feel for him. I'm sure I got duped items all over my 2 characters lol. That would suck if I got banned because I got those from somebody else in a trade etc. But I mean that's a ton of ammo. I traded for 5k 556 the other day and I'm constantly fighting weight capacity with bandolier rank 1. üò©
---
This ain't a denial or anything. If the buff said something like 5% dmg bonus per stack, people would have flipped. but since current meta is built around keeping your hitpoints lower than 20%, benefits of hp bonus is minimal and nobody cared
---
Essentially 
---
I‚Äôve only done the horde events a couple of times, but once I‚Äôve paid the caps to travel to the event, the objective updates and then on my map there will be three-ish little circles near the area, with the actual horde being in one of those circles.
---
Gg
---
Dude, you got banned for spamming the same comment repeatedly over and over... like a bot.
---
This suspension is to keep any dupers away from the game since they've also put checks on if you pick up 100k "rare" items. The BanWave already *supposedly* caught duper hunters in it's grasp as they might take some mats to dispose of or for personal use. 
---
See, if dupers were still roaming around they could **LITERALLY** kill the game by duping millions of items and dropping them in high traffic areas. As Bethesda has no notices or bulletins on consoles, most console players probably aren't aware of these bans or the 100k limit on rare items, they may see a bag of nuka colas and say jackpot. Hell, they could even engage in pvp and when the player goes to their bag to take all real quick, boom, they're fucked. In fact, these limitations can *easily* be used nefariously by a sinister duper with about 40 bucks to spend on 76. I don't imagine that accounts are flagged in real time so this guy, with revenge in his heart, could try his darndest to hit the filthy casuals and white knights. 
---
I guess we can add Fallout to the list of things Bethesda successfully installed Skyrim onto! Ha-ha 
---
All joking aside, if I wanted to play melee, I would play an Elder Scrolls games. When I think of Fallout, I think of Power Armor and energy weapons - not swinging a hammer.  I would like to see other builds buffed to be as powerful as melee or TSE before the nerf. 
---
Yeah, not even logging back in until this is fixed, and I'll be PISSED if I have to remove all my mutations and re acquire them.
---
It's not a question of building right, it's a question of the disparity in the builds' and weapons' damage output. People can choose whatever builds they want and use whatever weapons they find (or in your case, bought), but there shouldn't be a 30-fold difference in damage output between a max build and a non-max build. Why? Because most of the people in this game, the ones with non-max builds, wind out missing out on lots of XP and loot.
---
I know that doesn't matter to you, because you're selfish. But it matters to me and the other non-maxers.
---
Well I'm using a rifle build that has been converted into a melee/rifle build after my explosive radium build got nerfed to death. There is a very noticeable difference in from yesterday to today. 
---
I'm not sure what your argument is at this point...... adrenal reaction makes a huge difference. It didn't hurt your build good for you. Ironic how my build was never one shot killing mutants but yours still does.......yet I'm the guy looking for one shot game play... LOL.
---
Of all the decisions your mother made in the back seat of that Ford fiesta on prom night, it's a shame swallowing wasn't one of them. For the record, I'm only lvl 174, with a pretty beafy set of unyielding armor and a bloodied super sledge... Under the right circumstances I can hit for 1k&lt; and 3x when hidden. No chems, bobbles, mags, or mutations.
---
Unless you're ranged...
---
Lol man I feel ya, spent hours saving to buy tse weapons to use, and not they're excess fat hahaha
---
I got campfucked(they destroyed my whole camp and I couldn‚Äôt stop them)by some level 200+ kids. Is that casual PvP or were they assholes? 
---
Either way: NOT expected behavior?

Some advice, pop in minecraft. Dig a very deep hole and just sit in it. It could help your ego I heard and we wouldn't have to see your glyph of a post.

Damn straight I do!
---
You're not running 1 END unlike some people.  That's really bad.  4 is workable.

I just did it and it don't show I have the mutation however I get the effects of the mutation. So it's working just not showing

no. I tried everything but it just disappears and doesn't come back. What I can say is if you are trying to utilize your junkie weapons, you don't have to worry about your addictions curing itself
---
Thanks! If I think of it, I'll post here April 19th or 20th to cry over the terrible time I'll have had between now and then in 76, and over the game being dead (servers empty, dead modding community, end of new content and patches from BGS, this and other 76 subs being dead, etc.); it will be sad indeed when, as you predict, all of that happens within two months.
---
You should definitely remind me then of how you told me so, and I'll reiterate how lucky you were to be banned from the terrible experience that is the soon-to-be-dead Fallout 76.
---
I'm such a glutton for punishment though, that right now I'm going to go play for a while. Maybe I'll decimate a horde or two--heavy machine guns and nukes blazing--with a buddy, or start the BoS quest line (lvl260 and I still haven't been through the DMV!), or continue on the main quest line, or build a brand new CAMP (just got some new plans), or help a noob or two with some backup or supplies ... so many unfun things to do! Thank goodness your ban prevents you from partaking in any of that horrible un-fun-ness!
---
Lol , admits he cheated but still bitchs about punishment , my question is how the fuk was you raised, lol I been to jail but u do the crime u do the time or at least expect and accept that it is a real possibility 
---
Guns far too weak? Are you insane or just a crybaby? Get a legendary handmade of any kind and a good sneak critical build especially with grim reapers sprint, and scope with long range perks. You can kill everything within a half mile without even moving. Your dps is fucking insane. 
---
Melee has to run over to everything and hit it manually while you can literally just stand in one place and pop off dozens of shots in seconds. Learn to play maybe??
---
The switch is at the bank of the QA testing room, and that place has been on fire for weeks.
---
I switched away from it to a Switchblade build with vampire and swing speed. It kills in the same amount of time with an Unyielding set, just 3-5 swings. Only switched back to check about the bug and one-shots
---
if you have friends, force them to join you. even if it means they hate you afterwards. if you have no friends play it like a single player game.
---
Its gone for me, even in numbers.

&gt;Way to screw up you F-Sticks. If this is resolved by the end of the week Im gathering up everything I ever bought from you and dropping it off at your Bethesda MD location.  
---

&gt;1370 Piccard Dr #120, Rockville, MD 20850
---
While you may not like the Nerf the people on here have been begging for it over and over and over. I personally like the challenge. Don't blame Bethesda, this was requested.
---
Aww now you resort to personal attacks. How cute is that!! Grow up, kid, and go back to school. You can't spell for shit üòÇ
---
And what's up with the "I'm level ___" comment? Level matters nothing past 50. What a dunce. 
---
And you only hit for 1k with a BLOODIED Sledge? Lmao. That's hilarious. What a loser. Try harder.
---
I have a camp there and someone destroyed the generator. House is unlocked and open to anyone who wanted to come in for benches or box. Or relax  and play an instrument. 
---
Directional clues from talking? Haha, buster you‚Äôre funny. 
---
Sometimes my normal armor is shown as equipped when I'm in PA... maybe when I'm in Excavator PA but not the others?
---
I love this part  
---
&gt;For .50 or 5mm you just need less then 500 fluxes. You get multiple fluxes per queen and you can kill her multiple times a day. 
---
You do only need less than 500 fluxes, but that ammo requires Violet Flux, which is one of the more rarer drops.
---
So with Level 2 Ammosmith you get 180 rounds of ammo each time you make it. If you have Level 3 Super Duper you get a 30% chance to double the results, however every time you dupe this way you only get the base ammo, which would be 100 rounds of ammo. So on average every time you make .50 or 5mm you will get 213.3 rounds on average.
---
In order to get to 100,000 rounds you'll have to craft that ammo 469 times on average. You can only launch each silo once every 3 hours. So you would have to launch each silo 156 times, plus one silo. To do every silo solo every three hours the fastest you can do it would be 471 hours. So if you are getting 6 hours of sleep every night you can launch 6 groups of nukes that day. Which would amount to 26.166 days to launch the nukes and kill the queens. That's not taking into account the time to launch each nuke and the layover time between the first nuke in the group and the last. 
---
Lastly the amount of materials you would need are crazy as well. It takes 8 Gunpowder, 15 Lead, and 30 Steel to make 5mm Ultracite ammo, not counting the Flux and Ultracite that you would get from the Queen. The materials required for the ammo would be 3,752 Gunpowder, 7,035 Lead, and 14,070 Steel. This is also hoping that on average you're getting Violet Flux every Queen kill.
---
waaaah
---
Is this going to be fixed? Will players regain the effects? Or is the fix to just suck it up and buy/farm another serum?
---
love you bethesda thankyou so much for stash increase wooooooooooooooooooo
---
It‚Äôs ok coz meelee wasn‚Äôt nerfed 
---
If Sony was okay with it back in 2015-16, it‚Äôd be ok the game now. But they didn‚Äôt say it was fine until a month before release, way too late for Bethesda to implement it into the game. And now, I‚Äôd rather them spend the time and money getting to an actual release state than them let me play with my friends that don‚Äôt have a pc. 
---
I highly downtown you could do better without chems, mutations, mags, or some other exploit. If you can, prove it.
---
Hahaha. 
---
I second this. The fix should not be "suck it up and buy another serum"
---
New paint schemes for industrial equipment are okay. What I REALLY want for my Excavator is a beeping safety claxon when I back up. 
---
My bloodied gauss rifle can't even kill in one shot.
---
Just like the TSE nerf I find myself back to a lame melee build.
---
Another broken update .
---
Where would you say its better to get legendaries?
---
on those red creatures once they are at your base if you pacify them then log off they will stay with a white bar, and may i ask what was the highest lvl of those creatures? 
---
if you're on PC, I'll just make you a few adrenal reaction serums if you have the flux for it; or if I have some spare.
---
I never said guns were "Far too weak" I said that they were far too weak in comparison to melee. There's a difference
---
If they didnt want us to share the codes bethesda would have made the quest have different codes for each person and make it impossible to share. They made it this way for a reason. YOU ARE DEAD WRONG SON NOW APOLOGIZE 
---
I guess this is the stealth nerf everyone was afraid of for low health builds...
---
This is such a hand wavy argument.
---
Because the game has bugs it definitely means they can't ban people correctly.
---
Wow.
---
Oh man, r/quityourbullshit type stuff now. 
---
Not every Bloodied/adrenal build is melee. Mine is a rifle
---
My AD is borked too.  Have a two shot single action that was doing about 150 dmg yesterday and is doing 100 today.
---
Thanks for the nerf.. again.
---
LoL balancing...
---
Yeeeeaaaaaaaah
---
As long as you don't have turrets pointed at the golf club, you should be fine.
---
But some people just see any camp on the White Spring property at all and nuke it from orbit whether it's being problematic or not.
---
ok?
---
word, I've got a few collapsed disks, doc says I can't
---
The game has been out for 90 days, or 2,160 hours. 
---
He has 37 days played, or 888 hours. That means he would have to play 9.87 hours a day, every day, for 90 days.
---
This basically means he did little other than play this game.
---
I literally just put Wrecking Ball on and Demo Expert and 3 Nuke Mines later. Poof. Camps gone and I have a 2000 cap bounty on me. 
---
I love you
---
I had 1400 atoms, prayed for the armour skin to be at 1400 or under, it was at 1400. Bought it, no regrets. XO-1 looks dope as fuck with full mothman paintjob and headlamp
---
But they hit ranged weapons AGAIN with this "nerf"
---
It seems to me that the problem is not melee, but the Bloodied build. Both melee and explosive guns are overpowered in that build. I use melee without the Bloodied build, and I get 400k max damage with All Rise.
---
I agree with you, ranged weapons need to be buffed. Hell, I used to use guns, but switched to melee because guns are ridiculously underpowered. Buff the guns, leave melee alone, and nerf the Bloodied build.
---
He thinks Bloodied builds are strictly melee I'm guessing?
---
I want that job lol
---
I'm still getting the positive effects as I said it's just not showing up on my mutation list. Did you happen to use a rad-x and that not wear off yet? 
---
I have been scrapping them since the first week and no longer get mods when I scrap combat rifles or lever guns, but I still don't have everything unlocked for either.
---
Nope they are suspending the accounts of anyone who ever accumulated 100K of any item, not even in their inventory at once. Apparently between people that received gifts of Lrg QTY, those that found bags with a whole pile of junk in them (my problem) or people genuinely just good at the farming in the game we're all just "dupers" according to Bethesda. 
---
Got any input?....or just another asshole hiding behind a keyboard?
---
Not taking sides here, Just wanted to pop in for a quick FYI

That happens to me too all the time. Oh man this one time the ghoul I killed got up and walked headless backwards to its spawn point. It was like it was being re-winded, super creepy. I could also loot it as it was walking.
---
You ever heard of power creep?
---
this I know where to go to be solo or where to go to group up and be social.
---
Have could have used a vats crit too
---
Check in the pavilion next to the Landview Lighthouse. There's a corpse laying across one of the tables, and he's always got some Daddy-O on him or near him (I forget which).
---
Old bug. Log off, log on, get another commendation if necessary.
---
I doubt you've played the game then, you must be trolling. Your comment was also very vague and generic.
---
Interesting, when it dissapears from pip boy, do the stat penalties still apply?
---
This guy here is just a junkie lurker who needs to crawl back into his hole.
---
 LOL. The same thing happened in ESO. "Oh its too hard!" and the nerfs began. It was actually a hard game for a while and fun for those like me.
---
 A pity but the way of the world. Too bad. 
---
Just report and deport
---
where is the random enconter spot i went south is it on the  road?
---
more interested in that than the BF :) i'm trying to find them all
---
Scorched inquisitor, I believe. They shred through PA. 
---
the fender shoulders and whatnot would really lend themselves to the hot rodder flame paint job. 
---
[maybe](http://cdn-webimages.wimages.net/04fdc5ffeb7a78849656a80d26043aabcbc627-wm.jpg?v=3)
---
I had a similar issue. After getting it fixed I joined a party and applied strange in numbers, which actually lowered my damage. I then removed and it fixed it back, I then ran a silo and a queen fight. After dying in the queen fight I noticed it had bugged the adrenal again. Later I relogged and it was working correctly again.
---
Idk man idk
---
Funny you assume a CM can help you. Lol
---
If you build like a glass cannon, you are gonna die. End of story. You have no room to complain if you aren't even using Blocker. 
---
Ummmmmmm when the hell did they get added to the game? I've never seen them till today then if that's a thing
---
Yes. it's just that it doesn't appear on effects tab
---
sorry, would you prefer "stop complaining and get the fuck off this subreddit hurr de durr mai loots!" 
---
you had bad RNG. Get the fuck over it kiddo. Now im being an asshole. 
---
That is not entirely true, I have seen people with full health one shot or two shot a level 91 Deathclaw and a level 80 Scorched Beast with a melee weapon.
---
Then, don't expect people to spoon feed you when there's a comment about 5 or so upwards, explaining why Sent/Ass is so good. You literally don't even have to leave this post. It literally took more effort for you to write a comment asking, than to scroll up three inches...
---
Trying to do the update buts it's trying to download the entire game instead? 
---
I miss some of the house building mods I had in FO4. O e had like Victorian houses and another had the 1960s opening house style. More rugs would be nice too. But I order to do more building. They need to increase the lot size and budget. It would be nice if friends could camp together in one larger base. Like if 3 friends decided to join together it makes the base area larger and does a combined resources and the whole base shows up if one friend joins.  Of course it would also mean the whole base would be destroyed in one friend decided to move. 
---
Part of me rather cross platform at the moment, I‚Äôve enjoyed it even with it‚Äôs all it‚Äôs glitches but as time goes on, I just yearn to experience the game for its purpose, to play with others. If I wanted a great fallout solo experience I‚Äôd replay Fallout 3 or New Vegas. 
---
&gt; You also need to be ridiculously low on health to output that type of damage.
---
This is the key point. Melee damage gets an extra 75-200% or more damage out of Strength scaling while SPECIAL stats do nothing* for any other kind of damage.
---
Dealing high damage at 20% health would be a fine trade-off if it actually increased risk but the same build can also become nearly invulnerable.
---
*Increased VATS accuracy doesn't count.
---
Just added it for humor really.
---
I hit for 1.2k with my Anti Armor DCG. Under certain scenarios I hit for 2k+.
---
"Prove it" I would if this was FB where I can easily post screenshots. 
---
Why is clean underwear not in the atomic shop? Come on charge like 10 atoms Bethesda will clean up on that one! 
---
Currently if you have 0 caps and engage in PvP it results in 50% damage to players leaving me to just get wrecked since I can‚Äôt pvp anyone cause my low damage just results in them preventing me from getting their caps.
---
It's not targeting one specific person or naming them so it's probably fine.
---
You can build pistols by default. Then you change the Stock to a Rifle Stock and it becomes a Rifle.
---
witch hat and skeleton mask can be made now 
---
exacly I miss Adrenal üò´üò´üò´
---
Just make sure not to treat it too much like one of the main fallout titles. The first problem I had was getting too thrown off by lack of dialoge options. You juat need to get into your head to treat this more like an mmo then Fallout game imo. The one thing this game does great though is story telling, get immersed as much as possible. There is tones of story to discover so take yoir time searching places. On top of taking tim, take time doing the story quests. Between all the content and mobs getting over leveled due to nearby high level players it can be hard to get past even the Savage Divide. If you truly love Fallout then youll love this spinoff, it has all the quicks/bugs/randomness of any other Fallout game but now with other people running around. :)
---
He's lying, they patched item transfers in this way. How would I know? I used to transfer items this way and after the last patch ( like a month ago) my friends would be standing there and my items would disappear if they didn't pick them up. I tried putting them in workshop containers, random pubic containers, and on the ground. They used to stay in that instance but after the patch the disappeared. LIAR LUAR PANTS ON FIRE. GTFO 
---
TLDR: Bethesda shouldn‚Äôt have messed with PvP in Fallout, which doesn‚Äôt even play well as a PvE game (not that I don‚Äôt love it nonetheless).
---
5k is just people quoting sneak attack numbers, a bloodied super sledge or grognaks will get up to 2k-2.5k when you are at low hp, full unyielding +1str,with full food and drink and Chem bonuses. 
---
&gt;I was a melee + heavy gun(for queen) build and still got suspended. Found a bag with a S-load of junk in it and now i cant play the game i paid $80 for. Thieves.
---
It‚Äôs not that serious
---
good find. I learned something today.
---
That's correct. Scrapping any piece of armor can unlock any scrap-unlockable mod for that armor type, so you only need the light arms plans to unlock everything.
---
Well shoot. I'm not 100% but I know my deathclaw was 20 or 21. The mirelurk was 15 and the wolf was low. I believe it was only 7. The wolf I just tamed about a hour ago and logged off. I just logged back in and he is gone. :(. As for the rat's level I have no clue..
---
Right, but you're missing the point entirely. To me, you shouldn't be able to log in, open the map, and then be like "Oh, looks like my favorite grinding spot is taken, guess I have to avoid that area for now or just server hop." Server hopping is another thing I hate about this game but that's a discussion for a whole separate thread.
---
There should be risk / reward for going to a "popular" area and not knowing if someone is already there until you actually get there. Again, like I said Bethesda will probably never do this because more of the playerbase is like you rather than me. If Bethesda gave us the option to join special servers like this it would be awesome for the players who want to, I know I can't be the only one like this!
---
Thanks for letting us know guy!
---
TSE was a problem *in comparison to other legendary affixes*. Two-shot being +100% damage unconditionally and explosive also being +100% damage unconditionally and stacking multiplicatively was a huge disparity - almost 6x as much benefit compared to the next best thing.
---
Melee is doing so well because it is the only damage to scale with a SPECIAL stat and using unyielding armor and consumables can push a player's strength beyond 40.
---
Your right and I don't think most of the replys your getting actually read you post and just heard what they wanted to assuming your hitting all dupes. The grind is to tough, so I've relied on trading to get the ammo and scrap or mods etc I need. But now all the traders are getting banned for trading to much(not duping) . What exactly are we supposed to be doing in this game beside trying not to get banned. 
---
I agree with all this.  The main story becomes more difficult quickly.  If you rush the story you‚Äôll quickly be under level.  Take your time exploring you‚Äôre not getting to some special end game that only happens after beating the game.  Second resource management:  you need screws, springs, and gears hoard them.  I recommend around 200 each in your stash as a goal.  Plastic, steel, and adhesive up to 300 -400.  Only bulk lead and aluminum for your stash all other bulking makes the material heavier.  Watch out for ammo weight,  choose two types of guns or melee weapons sell the rest.  This saves valuable space.  As far as building do power plant missions for generator plans and visit the dmv for a purifier.  
---
Enjoy the game and ignore the negativity.
---
What do you mean? Many, many headsets and even TV's offer digital surround sound nowadays where this is possible?
---
Well you've obviously never met me. I use wanted status regularly to bait people like you, and 99% of the time they fail to kill me (because of Ass/Sent, dodgy, dense, fireproof, blocker, lone wanderer, etc) and I make hundreds if not thousands of caps from their continued attempts at revenge.
---
Yeah. What a dick.
---
Anyhow.....
---
So level 40 mole miners can't drop level 50 gear but level 68 mutants are dropping level 40 gear?.......... c'mon Bethesda......wtf?
---
So you put your camp there
---
Especially when said ban is based on a score that is legimately attainable (in this case bullets). It's like a cop giving you a speeding ticket for getting across the state in a couple hours when really you just didn't make any stops.
---
not no one
---
Really? I have seen players walk up to level 80 and 90 creatures including Death Claws and Scorched Beasts with hardly taking any damage. People are just defending the melee builds. I agree the TSE was op and needed to be brought down a little.
---
Mate go ahead and read your comment above and tell me that sounds like you are telling me (how it is from experience man) you gave me and everybody else  judging by downvotes a im better than you nice try buddy like come on man. Assassins sentinel is already frowned upon  and you just fit stereotypical I win you lose me better bullshit.
---
I'm outta the loop, what's wrong with AR? You need to retake it? Can you help the helpless? Lol 
---
Bothers me since fo4. 
---
It might be a bug, you might of gotten another players loot table. I played with my girlfriend earlier, and shes level 35, i got a lvl 30 leather chest piece. And she got a lvl 50 Robot chest piece (Im lvl 213)
---
1. Yea... the sneak bug is still there.
---
2. They removed Flare from legendary drop table but I just got DRILL from legendary mob. I'm pretty sure Syringer still on the loot table too. Like are you guys serious? How many patches do you guys need to completely remove Flare, Drill and Syringer from the legendary loot table.
---
3. The bulk junk issue still there. I just wasted a ton of plastic just to rebulk all my junks after login; thinking that they have fixed it.
---
4. And I heard Adrenaline mutation's not working now.
---
Saw a few posts like that of Boston when 4 first came out. It was neat, so I know it would be good for 76 too 
---
Yea I noticed this two. I tried to build next to my friend with the idea one is could have the water and the other could have the Work benches but couldn‚Äôt get very close.  Maybe they are thinking of increasing camp boundaries in the future. 
---
My first base when the game launched was just outside of the golf course on a cliff. I liked being close to it because I like golf in real life haha. It turned out to be a good spot for a while 
---
Because the complaint was about PvP, why else would people care if they only could do that damage against npc enemies? 
---
Yeah it was during week 2 when the game was a hot mess so it didnt seem like they cared about glitches at the time. After that i never did another.
---
What happened to Adrenal Reaction?
---
A quick circuit of Watoga by the Super Duper Mart and the high school --especially post mayor for a day-- will generally produce at least one one-star level 50 pacifist legendary protectron and I've occasionally seen two and three star legendary protectrons. There's other places, like West Tek that can reliably produce decent legendarie, but Watoga is my personal favorite.
---
No I‚Äôm telling you that your plan is flawed severally, helping you really. If I had the attitude you claim I have then I wouldn‚Äôt say a word until I killed you, then boast as you seem to think I would.
---
Tested on Watoga robots with a furious semi-auto combat rifle. It's roughly +30% base damage at max, probably +5% per hit. Due to the way the damage formula works, that's +43% real damage.
---
Not sure about the missing and target switching rules.
---
ok just curious highest thing i have been able to tame is lvl 30 mirelurk king but i have seen others say they have tamed higher than that i am lvl 260 and can't find anything higher than that mirelurk king that will let me tame it
---
From what I can see in the Pip-Boy, it is definitely still working for me.
---
They broke it you don't get the positive effects from it atm.  If you can't make it yourself I'll give you 1. Gt is the same as here 
---
Which were available the same way tse weapons were. 
---
Seems like it, and it seems like what most ppl think.
---
Bloodied isn‚Äôt op, melee is.
---
Ty for the tip...I do want to see if the lack of addiction display is just hangover (never apologize for puns) from already being addicted pre-patch.  Just have to gather the chems.
---
That's absolute bullshit. He is not hitting for 15k for starters, he's not even taking off big chunks of the queens health bar. I knock off bigger chunks than that with my bloody 40% power attack grognaks axe and it lists damage at around 2k maximum. And the video is from December lmao get outta here. 
---
Xbox 1
---
I crashed to dashboard twice today in a 1 hour gaming period.
---
But you are forgetting that this is NOT Fallout 5. It is a different game entirely, and the people who don't want PvP are upset at this. Bethesda is trying a new type of game. 
---
This game is slowly being gutted and shifted into what PvE players want. I thoroughly enjoy both, I have played every Fallout title, as well as Elder scrolls since Morrowind. I love games with aspects of both PvP and PvE. And I especially love it when my work in PvE makes me stronger or better geared for PvP. Games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne got this spot on. 
---
I realize that the majority of Fallout fans don't want this type of game, but it wasn't meant for that. It is a new game in the Fallout series, but a different animal entirely. Maybe I am a minority with my gaming joys.
---
@PS4 players, DO NOT play Monster Mash event until after level 100 unless you don't care about risking not getting that trophy.
---
^
---
I like that idea. I'd add, also split Bobbleheads/Magazines into their own tab too. Aid is just too broad of a category and there's too much stuff piled in there.
---
I've got the recipe but thank you. My dmg has been off all damn day but didnt know why. Normally I'm 1 hitting in the silos, but it was taking like 6-8 hits - total wtf moment. 
---
If 15k 50cal rounds is your maximum then I'm pretty sure you're fine.
---
Thanks. I had posted before I realized the ban.
---
No speculation whatsoever. The ticket shows he created 225,000 ultracite ammo at the very least. There is no possible way for him to have done that legit. 
---
He 100% cheated and so did most of the people being banned. Does it suck and seem a little extreme? Yes. Does it make sense because people were infact selling this stuff for hundreds of real dollars. Absolutely.
---
I think it sucks we lost a large member of our community who put in hundreds of hours. Would a inventory wipe make more sense for these players? Probably.
---
Don't u need to unlock higher gunsmith levels 
---
I never stated my age. You know what they say about assumptions. Let me make one about you.
---
You're mature enough not to respond anymore.
---
I will don't let the door hit your whale ass on the way out üòä
---
Because they got tired of getting one shot in pvp. Now someone wit a tse takes 10 shots or more to kill, but a melee can one shot.
---
Hey there watch it.
---
I am happy I bought bc I like the game vary much . Bc I play with my friends and we do stupid shit. This game wasn't ment to be played solo 
---
If you think FO76 runs differently from previous Fallouts, your flat out wrong. FO76 has bugs that have been present since Fallout 3. Its literally the same enging, turning it online wknt change this. And thinking otherwise is moronic. 
---
No chems, no mutations, no bobbles, no mags, no exploits, and you claim to do 2k with a dcg, what perks you running and what other mods on dcg. Cause I don't believe you.
---
Broke it completely. Doesnt work anymore unless you reapply the mutation..and all the other mutations you lost in the process. 
---
Well put lol
---
Yeah just take off starched genes and get rid of AR and take it again. I reloaded and AR isn't on my mutations list however my damage numbers are up idk if they are as high as before cause I haven't played in at least a week but they not as low as they were when I logged in today
---
Shew, what a bitch made, dumpster fire of a post this is......
---
It went from 2nd page specialty item with a strong fan following of people that had never been to the restaurant to the featured du jour main course every weekday.
---
Your life must suck if this is what you have to do.
---
Not my type of game.
---
Honestly I agree 100% - I was gifted 2000 5.56 ammo which i went though a ton of at west Tek and Now it‚Äôs just a constant struggle again. But that period when I had a large amount did allow me to just relax! And that was so so nice. So I share the sentiments of the original post. I dont feel this need to ban and hate dupers, making the grind easier is natural. I didn‚Äôt because it just didn‚Äôt motivate me at the time. But I‚Äôm def not about the witch hunt like some. Like you do you. I avoid people and run into few problem. I have some friends i play with and thats a blast too but either way freaking out about gameplay that honestly probably effected me 20% of the time is a waste of my time. I‚Äôm glad they moved extra items because I didn‚Äôt know that was causing server issues so once I learned that I was grateful but I still don‚Äôt feel this need to get so angry
---
I don't understand why people trade game items on the web. If there's no trading post in-game, just stick with what you find.
---
Okay! Look I'm sorry! I was running around the nuke zone and I got to ground zero and thought it would be cool if my camp was right there. I didn't realize it was a dick move! I'm sorry!
---
I store my stash..and I dare u to try to grief me 
---
I have this recipe.   If your on PC I can help you out.  Just provide the mats.
---
Can I pick just one to get rid of tho? I run about 14 mutations. There are a few I don't want. 
---
Newb, here.  Please explain why that's bad/wrong/inappropriate.  Thanks.
---
This is the only thing I could find, though it doesn't mention the employees being from a "discard basket" as the prior poster said: [https://www.pcgamer.com/battlecry-studios-is-now-bethesda-game-studios-austin/](https://www.pcgamer.com/battlecry-studios-is-now-bethesda-game-studios-austin/)
---
It‚Äôs only an unfair advantage over other players in PVP, otherwise my gear is meaningless to you. 
---
The cries over duping are far too loud and lack meaning. Unless you‚Äôre invested in PVP or on the end of a griefer then duping doesn‚Äôt mean anything. The economy was ruined from the start with a caps exploit, so duping items doesn‚Äôt even hurt the economy.
---
Someone is salty as fuck their mom didn't let them have a Klondike bar before bedtime... 
---
This was 2 weeks ago
---
This video is all hype. He's hitting for no damage while saying WOW LOOK AT THOSE BIG CHUNKS. lmao dude look at the upvote to down vote ratio on that video, why would you even post this trash? 
---
Hey, could I join the discord as well?
---
Wall of text did not read
---
No you can't pick and chose sadly. I just jumped in my rad shower and luckily it was the 2nd to go I only run like 6 mutations or so atm should probably have more just don't feel like it

Thinking they took an offline single player client and turned it into an online game without major changes or additional server-side functions is what's moronic. 
---
Bugs related to game mechanics are not related in any way to client-server functionality, that's a really silly thing to compare.
---
Thanks for the laughs though!
---
Just... wow. So instead of taking any responsibility Bethesda is really just going to tell anyone who uses exploits they should just patch that they are the ones in the wrong. Self absorbed money grabbing, backstabbing idiots.
---
Everyone needs exploding farts üòÅ if only it sent out a cloud of glitter, I'd be a happy unicorn.

The cries over duping are far too loud and lack meaning. Unless you‚Äôre invested in PVP or on the end of a griefer then duping doesn‚Äôt mean anything. The economy was ruined from the start with a caps exploit, so duping items doesn‚Äôt even hurt the economy. It‚Äôs like everyone is getting tunnel vision saying duping ruined the game like the long list of other issues doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
I'm having fun!
---
Strange, that shouldn't happen.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I lost 4 of our 6 person squad from beta days in about 40 days. We all grounded hard, we all leveled together, 1 of my friends was at 100 by the time some of us hit 50. He was the first to quit. The others slowly caved as they each hit 100. None of them ever got any decent legendary drops while I specced for charisma and team perks with max luck and some how was getting 2shot and explosive weapons and lovely melee items daily. I shared everything I looted with them but they weren‚Äôt getting any of the reward feeling at all. After I hit 100 they all quit. I know rng is rng but Bethesda should come up with some way after you reach 100-300 hours that you end up with a few decent drops to feel rewarded. Flat out relying on rng hurts for some players that just never get anything. I felt bad watching all my friends just quit while I still play solo a good few hours a day. 
---
Lmao nice. 
---
Yeah it's a pretty good place if you can get a spot that doesn't get claimed often. It's pretty central and you're close to a lot of fun stuff.
---
You can get quest legendaries like All-Rise etc. if you don't have anything better available. 2h melee can be pretty strong even with minimal point investment.
---
It was a sales event. it is over and done with and if you think for a second at the very most 60 hp makes any sort of difference then you aren't playing the same game.
---
you want pay to win? look to games like RDR2 the amped up the grind so you buy gold to bypass level gates and can actually get gear will it still matters.
---
oh, and nice way to bring up the false loot boxes again. when they still dont show up in 2 months (like they didnt show up at christmas like people were claiming originally) are you going to move the goal posts again?
---
I'm not.
---
Now go to bed you fucking nobody
---
How do you know "they" arnt other gun users?

This whole post reeks of elitism against a perceived 'other side' for some reason without any proof

No. The ticket says they believe with certainty that he has. What's to say this isn't a glitch or error in counting and they're wrong? I'm a big fan of Fallout 3 (favorite game!), Bethesda and hopeful for the future of FO76. But we're only a few months into a game built on an engine never meant for multiplayer, by a company that has more or less never done online multiplayer to any relevant degree worth mentioning, and with a technical track record that is sketchy at the least. Todd Howard said it best when he told us to expect spectacular bugs on launch. World of Warcraft suffered years worth of bugs that stemmed from the earliest days of their engine being modified for multiplayer. This is _no_ different. Don't kid yourself that it being 2019 must mean the technology is somehow more fool proof.
---
Again, I'm not defending this guy. I don't know any better than you do. All I can say is I hope the people writing this response to him are being genuine in their research into the issue and in their reporting to him. I say this as a guy who has on many occasions had trouble tickets blatantly blown off by developers who didn't bother reading into my problem or doing some research into what I'd found. Who has gotten snide responses to issues, only to get grudging acceptance when I push a little harder despite all the idiots telling me I'm wrong.
---
One spawns at my camp. It's by the lookout tower behind WS, the cliffs there. He comes to say hi when I log on üòç
---
Don't care if you believe me or not. The fact is you suck, so I don't need to prove myself. 
---
idk either. bottom line is they should just fix It lol.
---
Sneak rifle build works well too. Up to 2.3x damage. 
---
Are you sure about the addictions not lasting?  How did you determine this?  I posted about this and was told that the addictions just stop showing up in the effects tab of the pip boy, but you still have them.
---
This was my first fallout game to play. I liked it very much maybe to much.
---
I have played about 5 to 8 hours a day from the time the game came out and i have  made lot's of characters. 
---
The friends I have made in this game are the best and i hope to talk to them again.  
---
I stood up for the game even with the glitches  and server crashes friends walking a away from the game i stayed.
---
But this last friday (02/15/2019) they suspended my account. I got a email from them Monday saying i Duped 100,000 rare Items. I know i did not dupe.   I don't know  what i did to get suspended it sure was not that. 
---
You are correct, that other guy is talking nonsense. 
---
IRL, You‚Äôre a trash bag, bro...
---
They are common but once in a while a legendary 3* will spawn and it shreds through everything. I feel like it's a bug though. Way over the top damage. 
---
It will bug out again eventually. Don't waste your caps on this solution.
---
Do you have to unlock the mod? The rifle stock mod that is.
---
We all are, brother
---
The Better Inventory mod does that... [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32)

I have Gunsmith 5 and Science 1. 
---
I could go for more 3 npc factions vs each vs player stuff... lol
---
Yes, so much for slap huh? I have had it happen too. I will get the name next time and report them. I just usually do what you do, but I have had them follow me too. I even blocked them, and they still found me. I think they may have someone on a team with them that is relaying the information. It would make sense. It really bothers me when they are really high level like 200+ and do it. It just tells me that they likely are bored, or fed up with the game. 
---
**The pacifist mode should be updated to not allow players to hurt you.** If you have pacifist mode on, then you get twice as screwed since you can't fight back (no damage to other players). In the case of one shot, it wouldn't matter, but in all other cases it does.
---
It may have been because I think both of them were at the generals steakhouse.....on 2 different servers though.
---
I did have another one in Watoga drop a max level 3* suppressor's spear.......and no that bad boy is not for sale.
---
do a tandem jump.
---
Do u guys kno if the shadowed paint is an obtainable mod?
---
Melee's downside should be that you can't use it for groups of mobs that are going to shoot you. Unfortunately nothing in this game hurts except mirelurk queens acid, and even if it does you have a huge supply of healing items. Love this game but the severe lack of any difficulty whatsoever really hurts it. And Bethesda won't be able to fix it or players will accuse them of "nerfing things to make us play longer". Buff every enemies damage, nerf melee slightly, buff guns, buff energy guns...alot.
---
Yeah. Part of the game (all fallouts and elder scrolls) was dungeon diving and mat acquiring. Sure you can give yourself two million gold, but then what do you leave the house for? What's the use raiding a dungeon for gems when you're already rich?
---
Meanwhile I'm still logging in after 250+ hours and just now got access to the Whitesprings bunker because I accidentally stumbled on Senator Blackwell's hideout looking for strangle pods.
---
Sometimes my damage dont register when i play with america ppl. Lags betweeen me and american server.
---
Melee weapons do more damage than ranged weapons.
---
Lol, I discovered the same thing the day I got marsupial and accidentally found out I could jump into my 2nd story windows...
---
For example if they made 10mm ammo which gives 86 per craft, or ~114 per craft with maxed super duper they would need close to 3200 stable flux to make this amount of ultracite ammo. Even playing 900 hours I find it very, very hard to believe someone could get that much flux. Then you have all the other ammo, the amount of steel/lead/gunpowder is just not feasible. The guy was a duper or collected the ammo from other dupers without doubt.
---
It just goes to show the amount of effort these people will go through to make a convincing sob story how they did nothing wrong when 9.9 times out of 10 they fully deserve their ban. I for one am happy these posts aren't allowed on this sub anymore.
---
nevermind i found it i think it's just a random creature spawn not a "random encounter" like i was thinking
---
I run a powered armored heavy gunner build. Which is GREAT for PVE. Especially with damage buffs and perks that help damage threshold while firing.
---
Unfortunately, when it comes to PVP this build gets me killed constantly. A ranged build just needs to use a powder rifle or dragon and I'm INSTANTLY dead. A melee build is fairly easy to handle if you can jump to higher places, but going up against an equally-matched suit of power armor/mutations will kill ya.
---
Alternatively, a VATS-central sneak build is super dope, on both spectrums. Someone took me out using a revolver, popping 3 stealth boys and other related items/mutations, crouching and one-shotting me lol much respect to that guy. 
---
Lol.  well they didn't include Bluefield either (unless you count the Salt Pork song), but...uh, small surprise there
---
there ya go.
---
I have the plan for the arms 
---
I'm sure u can craft them..I will find out how
---
I've done both of the suggestions you've mentioned before to no avail unfortunately. Hopefully they patch this soon.
---
You say I'm moving goal posts, but ignore that it's gone from rejecting all pay to win, to ignoring pay to win as long as it's only temporary. 
---
How do you know they weren't melee? The reason the op was getting downvoted is because melee players are salty and do not want to be nerfed.
---
I'm seeing the same with twisted muscles. No positive effect on login.
---
So there are plans..are u ps4 and how much 
---
I had to make multiple threads asking for a new one, then a month after my third attempt it happens.
---
[tinfoil hat] So...  BGS broke another go-to high damage build. What are the odds of that...  [/tinfoil]
---
Yeah I definitely did monster mash long before level 100 and still got the trophy too 
---
No shit it's on Bethesda, so instead of throwing away caps just sit the fuck down and wait for them to hotfix it.
---
I am on ps4 100 caps sound good
---
Ah, more baseless accusations. Because that clearly worked out so well for OP.
---
When it says deleted that means OP deleted the post. When it says removed it means a mod deleted it.
---
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah‚Ä¶.you can buy Unstoppables outfits?! Gotta check out that Atom Shop! 
---
You need to know you may have 24 hours to return it. Haha nah I'm jk.  Seek guidance from in game players but it gives you a decent tutorial in game. 
---
Yeah, nah.  Don't go to Welch.  OP was just acting in the interest of public non-boredom ü§£
---
Good work and nicely told, I especially like the three piggies imagery.
---
That is an awesome photo, thanks for sharing. :) 
---
Listen I get your point, it can be summed up pretty easily- dumb people cheat, but that doesn't mean all cheaters are dumb. Also my earlier point is even someone who *is dumb*, isn't going to duplicate *only ammo*.
---
What do players currently do with ammo they cannot use? They give it away, sell it, or drop it. This is because ammo has almost no value, you can't sell it to vendors, you can't break it down.. 
---
So, using logic explain to me why players who aren't dumb would duplicate ammo?
---
You can't just reply with they're dumb, and you can't say the goal is to sell it unless they've been caught duplicating something else *with it*.
---
Do you know why I included that last part? I'm going to test your reasoning and logic skills, because so far your reasoning has been "people cheat because they can, therefore it makes sense they duplicate ammo" which doesn't make sense considering it's worth so little that most everyone drops any they*do not need*.
---
For me personally, I‚Äôd rather be able to use my character than not, as adrenal reaction is 30% of my dmg. It is a costly fix and does requires relogging sometimes but at least I can play my character effectively.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 üòï
---
if you're on PC, add AlcaTabs. I have some spare adrenal reaction serums, and I can craft them, for when/if they fix this shenanigans. I also have a spare marsupial serum you can have in case you lose it. About to crash for the night, but the offer's there at least.
---
Wrong!

Push the view button while the pip boy is up.  Select on Xbox, Touchpad on PS4, Alt F4 on PC. üò¨

sent u message 
---
I'm not sure. I was trying to figure out what was happening too. I have a melee build with an Instigating Super Sledge, and it seemed to not be one shot killing ghouls at Whitespring during a rad storm from the nuke.
---
I didn't notice the Stimpak issue, but I did notice that when I took a Rad-X, that my rad meter jumped up (spiked) and seemed like I was taking more rads initially.
---
Ah, irony.
---
Should be available by default. Of course there are BETTER Pistol Grips/Rifle Stocks that have to be unlocked, but the standard ones should be available from the start.
---
It's just a bug that his damage is showing up as 15k. if he was actually doing 15k per swing the queen would die in about 6 hits, yet he's only doing tiny slivers of her health.
---
[Here's a video of a guy doing 40k per shot] (/https://youtu.be/0GSl607RJrM) and the queen dies in 2 hits. How come your buddy doing "15k per swing" isn't dropping the queen just as fast? You obviously don't even play this game if you believe that guy is doing big numbers with his gauntlet. 
---
I mean I'm lvl 213 and I don't think I've ever ran into one till today. It was crazy like a auto explosive gamma. Granted I run low heath most of the time but like 40% not 20% like most crazy people. An I couldn't do anything. Mainly because I didn't know who or wth was doing the shooting cause the damage area was all around me. I really thought it was the dang scorchedbeast except when I died the 2nd time they were both already dead so I ruled them out. I guess it just got me off guard at least now I know 
---
You know you can switch between the two right? They let you choose to have the power armor interface even when on foot
---
For the ultracite ammo alone making say 10mm ammo for example it is ~114 ammo per craft and they would need about 3200 stable flux. Way outside the realm of possibility for one month of play and that isn't even taking into account the other ammo. Guy deserved the ban.
---
No good reason why there aren't paint jobs in every basic color, for every set of armor and power armor. Sell them for 100 atoms each and I'd buy like 6 different ones. 
---
All I read was "blah blah blah I'm banned and now I'm crying". 
---
There are literally 10000s of "essays" on how people got banned blah blah and I say the same thing to all of them:
---
Enjoy the ban, hope you learned your lesson. Bye bye.
---
Some of those accounts seem to include real names. (When they set up their accounts, I think no one anticipated Bethesda would display account names in-game.)
---
Someone got to them before you on the server?
---
Well, if you can afford to keep removing it and re-adding it after it bugs out after every DC, crash, server hop, or logout/login, then keep doing that. Most can't afford to reapply all the random mutations that get lost from random mutation removal. Even if you can make the serums, that's a lot of stable Flux.
---
Im looking for these plans. Anyone able to come build a cabinet for me? I'll pay in caps
---
Let me add this as a warning, as a \[East\] Virginia native- if any of you do travel to WV but continue on (or come via) I-77 or I-64 through VA, be aware that Virginia takes law enforcement (specifically any speed greater than 7 mph over the speed limit) VERY seriously.  Like, unbelievably seriously.  And they have a LOT of state troopers.  So many.
---
&gt; Thinking they took an offline single player client and turned it into an online game without major changes or additional server-side functions is what's moronic.
---
Untol you realize thats literally what they did because everything points to this conclusion.
---
&gt; Bugs related to game mechanics are not related in any way to client-server functionality, that's a really silly thing to compare.
---
I never said game mechanic bugs. I'm talking about engine limitations and such. Fallouts engine can not read different items of the same ID, aka nonunique items instead it reads that same item, and a use number of it. You dknt have 100 500mm rounds, you have a 500mm round that has 100 uses. 
---
Yes it sounds dumb, but that's how the game reads and runs. That wont change by going online.
---
&gt; Thanks for the laughs though!
---
I doubt your laughing harder than me. Someone actually thinking Bethesda bothered to program something properly? That's a big joke.
---
DurzaTheShade#5560
---
when the topic was actually relevant I said it was in a grey area, because it was a meaningless buff, but it was a buff none the less, but hardly big enough to scream p2w. and was only for a week as a sales event to have people enjoy playing as a group of superheros rather than just buying it and taking a couple pictures and forget you have it.
---
unlike games like RDR2 where if you want to win you have to pay. perspective goes a long way.
---
but it was a buff none the less, but hardly big enough to scream p2w.
---
What do you need? Umm... It's a game so you cn play it, i guess.
---
This isn't complaining. This is saying you people think you'll finally have a fun game to play without cheaters, but the cheaters are definitely active. Way to miss the point.
---
If the truth hurts, All I am saying people assume what they want, you say how do I know, but you don't know. When it was a mix of melee and gunners without tse. You can't prove it was or wasn't either so asking someone else to do it is ignorant.
---
Been thru 3 servers. I hope new patch didn't wipe out
---
yeh i dont get that 900 hr guys post.
---
who has enough freaking time to collect so many thousands of a certain flux its just not viable at all.
---
As I'm sure you've already seen, that doesn't work.
---
1. Even if it did, that's a terrible "fix." Go randomly remove mutations until you get rid of the one specific one you need, then pay a ton of caps or hope to find someone helpful to get you back your mutations?
---
2. The "fix" is temporary and goes back to being broken after you relog.
---
I know others have said this, my intention isn't to clog the post with redundancy. But it's the day of a patch and your inbox is going to be full of all kinds of stuff. I'm adding to that clogged inbox, I know, but it's in hopes of making sure this gets seen and addressed.
---
Just 2 shot?
---
Doesn't change your point, but explosions are some sort of hidden third type rather than energy: Even with max level heavy leather, you still take massive damage from them. Add a Padded or Dense mod and the difference is immediately obvious.
---
Last I heard only the silver shroud did not remove your armor when you wore it.
---
This. The amount of variety for the current power armor paint jobs is very few and this would inflate the skins for power armor. Red T-45, Cyan T-60, customization is endless if Bethesda gives us a variety of solid color paint jobs. 
---
heard they fixed it from several people
---
One of the posts telling peeps how to fix this is here:
---

---
Some of the resources called have had their names changed, the manual install instructions for all the nexus mods needs to be updated to reflect this.
---
What did you expect to drop?
---
Yes, death to all commie bastards!
---
OP is saying melee users are the reason TSE got nerfed because "they" complained too much.
---
Yet when asked he cant produce even a single thread that supports his claim.
---
The burden of proof is on you guys, and it sounds like you are ceding the arguement since you cant produce any proof of it either.
---
I got the .45 rilfe. I don't want it. You can have it. 
---
Thats fair. I‚Äôm way to quick to believe a sob story. 
---
True dat!
---
Does your weapon damage increase as you lose health? If might be just a display glitch. Can you test (stand in radiation and let your health gradually drop and see if your weapon damage goes up... Check across a few weapons as you are losing health). I tested, and it definitely is re-broke after applying. So for me it is not a visual bug. Not sure what caused it to bug out again... Either Serum wore off, or server hop, or crash/restart, but it definitely bugged out again for me.
---
At least u found one. I only find crap.
---
People go to Whitesprings to farm ghouls. These enemies respawn when new people arrive, so naturally, people arriving consider them "their" ghouls to kill. Some sharing is expected, but the camps are set up to steal all the kills before anyone can get to them. The camp owners don't even get experience for the kills. They're just making things harder for other people.
---
"suck it up and buy one to 18 serums depending on how many you had to remove to get to Adrenal Reaction" 
---
Gauley Mine, or something like that.  North of Flatwoods.  The coal deposits are around the yellow tractors typically.  Look closely at the walls and floor near them.  
---
I am on PC. No I don't actually like PvP. If I wanted PvP, I would do Black Ops, or another game which has a more sophisticated PvP system. I just was not willing to give up.
---
It is a shame. I take over the various workshops, power them up, and give the materials/food/fusion cores away. I even put signs up saying free food, water, etc. They didn't even need to attack me. I would have let them have it for free. I only take what I need, and defend the workshop so others can benefit. Hence, I don't care for PvP. It is the reality for taking a workshop over though.
---
Yes.
---
thank you very much
---
You can get a plan from the reenactor
---
Yeah is it explosive?
---
HeY tHeRe WaTcH iT
---
I like taking trophies, guess i got to pay for it.
---
So after you compete mayor for a day, go hostile with the protectrons outside the shopping center and take the drops? 
---
Alas...buffout.  If you meant the open world chem on the picnic table next to the chem box and corpse then it‚Äôs not like the daytripper at the palace,if you meant another spot at the pavilion then someone already snagged it.  I‚Äôll check back from time to time, maybe it‚Äôs a high probability spot.
---
I wiped then re-applied my serums and Adrenal Reaction is working.  It doesn't show up in the status text, but as you can see from how happy my lever action is again in the screenshot, it's working.

---
My biggest issue with this as a melee dude is people thought balance = a melee can one shot you and a TSE can one shot you so it was even.
---
In no world should you be able to one shot someone *from a distance* and have that be even. If you have a distance advantage, there must be a trade off or it's automatically superior.
---
In my case I considered TSE only as good as their users. Sure if you ran blindly at them you'd get a face full of lead. But utilizing cover, stealth boys and simply watching their reloads, you could get in and knock them down. It wasn't fair, but it wasn't impossible either.
---
I mean now people have just switched over to Fat Man launchers anyway. Can't live without a ranged one shot but at least these idiots blow themselves up half the time now.
---
&gt;!evil evil person!&lt;
---
Damnit I thought I was right. Took me 3 years and I was wrong
---
I need this hat!
---
So when do we get new content? We need more missions etc. 
---
So if I, a player who will avoid all kinds of pvp at all costs, were to dupe, how exactly would that give me an ‚Äòunfair‚Äô advantage and ruin the game for you?
---
Love the downvotes we are getting talking about our game experiences lol. All them lurkers 
---
Idiot!
---
You hurt my feelings
---
:D . I lasted about 5 minutes, but I think it may be time to completely rebuild my CAMP. Which is fun. The new Mothman statue is cool.
---
Bruh don't feel bad twice this week 3 * legendaries dropped a mutants hatchet for me
---
I feel this so much. Picked up baggy of bobbleheads, popped like 30 for a queen run and dropped em again. One and done. I tell my story tho and ask about the ban that I have no info on, and flamed as a liar and a piece of shit. 
---
Bethesda and fucking up more things then they fix.

Name a more iconic duo.

---
just a huge misunderstanding lol lets hope it gets resolved :V
---
In my early days I thought I was a genius for doing this (did it once ever) and while it did kinda work I felt like a jerk and never did it again
---
Wait really how?
---
Might be a display bug only ... but if it is, then it's going to be hard to tell if you have the pre-patch mutation which absolutely doesn't work; or the post-patch mutation which only has a display bug.
---
Totally appreciate the offer but I'm not going to stress over it.
---
Go ahead and get some sleep I'll try to contact you on here if I decide I need to.
---
Nor bought or accepted clearly duped items.
---
It's hard playing a game without cheats these days I guess.
---
Didn't even think of ppl pvpin an using take all command on the baggy and screwing themselves.
---
Didn‚Äôt think this would be interesting or make my eyes open wider than they have in months but you did it, damn that‚Äôs something else.
---
Wait u saying they are going to fix dupping. I thought that shit was already fixed! 
---
Are you sure it's just not displaying in effects but actually giving you a damage bonus if you check your weapon damage?
---
I don't doubt its random. However, I think they just don't do any due diligence to make sure that the lists make sense. Some items may be for those who wish to have a challenge. A mutant slayer's rolling pin for example. I got one and said "challenge accepted". It took forever to kill one overlord and a lot of Stimpaks. I did win though. Then I chucked it like the junk it was into their meat bits.
---
Some items just should not exist. A prime receiver crossbow is one of them along with the XXX rolling pin.
---
It also means he was duping, and you're the only one having a hard time reading *that*.
---
For real?
---
Never had this problem
---
Yup, and she has the "glowing" enemy effect for the first few seconds when she emerges
---
Level 50 gear.......since I'm level 156 and the mutants were level 68 and all.
---
45 extra HP means nothing in this game. Just saying. If they make it +500 per mate remind me.
---
It's actually a psychological experiment.
---
Yep, checked it
---
I did an event and that one popped, was an escort Mr Gutsy that I tried. Also, was the only event I completed before heading off to night shift. 
---
If you still aren't getting it, please report back to us :)
---
And try things from different DATA tabs... meaning, MAIN/SIDE/DAILY/EVENT, so we can see if it is buggy for just one 'type' of event!
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
I ran into a guy who did this the other day, turrets aimed at the back door and windows of the golf club.  So I decided to be that guy and put on wrecking ball, explosives perks and dropped 5 orbitals on the place, leveled it to the ground.  Fast traveled to some friends an let them take the bounty, best 250 I ever spent.
---
I thought it was supposed to and that the bug was that it suppressed mutations when it went away
---
LOL...it just keeps getting worse.
---
Turns out we can probably have more stash space when dickholes aren't running around with a few million pounds of duped items on them.
---
Im not feeding you your troll chow. Move along.
---
OMG if ppl don't start searching if there's already a thread related to their topic

My online sarcasm detector is a bit defective when it comes to reading messages online.

"quickboy" interface. Press and hold the first/third person button with pipboy up to toggle on/off.
---
Well, you can area chat with people you come across (maybe to drop items you don‚Äôt need), and if they seem like minded, you can offer to team up, and go from there if you want. 
---
Having the same issue. 
---
"raiders" while used in game is pretty much a catch all term for groups that feel they can pretty much be bandits/rapist/murders ects since there is now "no law".
---
it bothers me more why "raiders" is already in use on the east coast more than the raiders existing.
---
Who told you that you were always only  supposed to get level 50 gear when you were 50 and above?
---
Boss shit tbh
---
I like my keypad entrance too much to ever remove it though.
---
... I have shadow on all my armour pieces, and chameleon legendary perk on 1 bit making me invisible when sneaking and not moving. I also have a legendary that makes me invisible when hit.
---
Why would I want to swap to wood? 
---
Humm I can. What program  are you making this in? Are you the same person who did the map for the resources? 
---
Strength does add 5% melee damage and +5 carry weight per point.
---
Touchpad on PS4. If on other console look at the bottom of screen when in pip boy menu where it says View, to the right of move camp
---
I have an unyielding set where the minor mods are all for weapon weight reduction, so i can carry a shit ton of legendary weapons and such to sell, later moved that armor to a handgun build and get crits every other shot because of the plus 15 luck and have insane accuracy with over 30 perception, plus with my agility over 30 and my stealth card maxed im pretty much invisible to the enemies, and with my ap at nearly 450 and the armors major modifier being ap regen plus the ap regen from nerd rage, i get a full regen within a split second, its pretty stupid what a full set of unyielding armor can do, especially when you have a lot of time to just do missions that specially give you legendary heavy combat armor, like the sbq and highschool event
---
weird once I add these my game just crashes. put it back in and the game works fine, but textures are all purple for atomic shop stuff.
---
personally, im not sharing camp info online anymore.  the more popular a camp location becomes, the harder it is to find a server with it open.
---
Word up!
---
I have a camp there, the door is always open for you if you want to come in. :)
---
Always makes me laugh when someone destroys it - I make enough junk in one whitespring run to rebuild after all.

Nonworries~ this was more an offer for whenever it gets foxed

You can "fix" this by wiping then re-applying Adrenal Reaction, I and others confirmed this works.  After re-logging you won't see the description in the effects screen, but the effects are active.  There's a proof screenshot I posted in the other thread.

Oh if u were PS4 I'd give u some 
---
This exact thing happened to me too! 
---
Specifically people who ignored explosive damage resistance (dense/padded existed long before the buff to fireproof) complained about pvp while choosing to ignore tools that would have helped.
---
What's the point in being "invisible when hit"? It doesn't actually do anything.
---
I don't need armor! I'm ***UNSTOPPABLE***!
---
Yeah, people like to cheat at videogames for a variety odnreasons. That's why cheat codes exist.

Do you have a head injury?

He would have been banned..duh

I don't think it looks as nice. The cammo pattern looks better on the BoS armor. I also have the Shielded BoS underarmor which I think has better perks.

been using an instigating hunting rifle all evening, had no issues with vats, my gauss rifle on the other hand...

Ah shit! Did I get you Cricket?

Ah OK I got'cha. I'll keep better track of the levels from here on out. 
---
Bethesda would be clutch if they fixed the Level 100 trophy so I could be one game closer to get every fallout game 100%
---
Not sure I'll try it later if I get back on. At one point it was showing the dmg it should be. Which is 499 (which is what it was yesterday as well) before adrenaline or buffs (not counting nerd rage and unyielding). but as soon as Adrenaline stacked it would sometimes go lower than 499 and stop at like 600-700, when it used to go up to 900 sum. It's wonky. Waiting for a Bugthesda fix at this point.
---
It shouldn't be up to us to find "Fixes".
---
Really? I did not notice when I was moving around the points. Is there a chart that someone has made, or something, that I can look at for reference?
---
Yes OP is over reacting for sure, but...
---
Why TF doesn't Bethesda have a test server? Drop updates the day before on test, or week before, or whatever. Other games do it, both big and small. Example of small - Standing Stones makes Lord of teh Rings online. They have a test server, has its own name, Bullroarer. When their shit is ready, they patch Bullroarer, and all the die hards log on with fresh toons and start pushing the limits, and there is easy feedback for anything you unearth. Polish and repeat so you can confidently drop it live. 
---
I work in IT and we have multiple isolated environments for the engineers to configure firewalls or whatever without risk to our clients. This isn't some crazy idea, it is industry standard. 
---
OP has a great point, despite his frustrations, in saying " Play. Test. Your. Updates. "
---
Whether someone is getting an unfair advantage or not(cheating) is objective,  either you are or you arent.  Taking advantage of the duplication exploit, either duping yourself or using duped items, is undeniably cheating.
---
Whether someone who is cheating is an asshole is subjective.  Personally I agree cheating makes you an asshole but can understand how/why the cheaters rationalize cheating.
---
Too bad the dupesauce winners got to keep one of every legendary item huh?  Doesn't really matter what the meta is, a goodly number of players likely have a whole set of soon to be meta armor and weapon lying around somewhere.
---

I accidentally duped once.
---
There's a bug where your worn power armor appears as a separate frame in your inventory but when you try to place it, nothing happens. It's a ghost suit! You can't tell the suits apart in your inventory, so it's like a constant troll from Bethesda when you're trying to manage your power armor collection. Every time I try to place a suit and it turns out to be a ghost suit, I hear Todd Howard in my head saying, "Ha!"
---
Well, this one time I was trying to put down the suits in my inventory (I'm trying to collect a full set of each), and one of them turned out to be the ghost suit. *And this time it actually placed.* There it was, same suit, same mods, same paint; identical to the one I was wearing at the time. I don't know how it happened when every other time it just does nothing.
---
I don't remember what I did with the suit. I suspect it wouldn't matter if I'd destroyed it or sold/scrapped the pieces if there was some mechanism of detecting "duping" like that. I'm not sure where that put's me in OP's hierarchy of "for friends/for profit" dupers.
---

The "Vanilla" Ammo doesn't matter at all TBH, here is an Example of what I have on one of 10 mules...

I always gave away thousands of rounds away at a time, usually when a new player bought (or was gifted) a weapon, and since "Black Tuesday" I've been dumping tens of thousands of rounds every couple days, so most of these numbers were in the hundreds of thousands previous.  
---
I generally don't use guns, and when I do it's very light ammo usage..  
---
So basically IMHO a 900 hour player could have millions of rounds, or 10 million rounds (I've likely given away a few million rounds of ammo) of Vanilla Ammo, and it's within the range of what is doable.  
---
   
---
As for the Fluxes, another author posted the math, for 5mm it would only take 1,350 fluxes, and that is collectible in a few days of work.  
---
yes, they should be banned. No, you are not the only one who can fight them.
---
I play loads of pvp and I have seen some really strong builds that are all legit. Including myself and we come across loads of these types of players. 
---
Well, you could say they are literally the source of my caps and junk when they come guns blazing and end up on their knees only to seek revenge and keep losing caps.
---
Smart and well constructed builds beat duped jacked dependent players any day.
---
Charted been 130something for a long time
---
Bloated used to be 400+
---
Yeah, I decided to make mine shadowed and ultra-light. I had it Polymer at one point. It took a lot of caps and time to get a full set since the mods don't say: arms, legs, chest. I was annoyed. I bought a dozen more mods than necessary at least to get the ones I needed. Then I decided to make it shadowed... lather, rinse, repeat.
---
I reported that I got attacked while crouching, and invisible thanks to chameleon and in trade with harper ferry vendor. I have every stealth perk, and all enabled. I also have stealth increasing breastplate.
---
When I started the trade I was [Hidden] and had got to the vendor without being seen or attacking anything. (i never even got a [caution]
---
30 seconds into the trade I am under attack by 5 supermutants, 3 physically hitting me with melee weapons they were that close.
---
Meathook works with one handed perks??!!
---
The mods said they were removing/deleting the posts yesterday...   
---
All the posts from yesterday / two days ago had the same tag..   
---
Unless the Mod's say otherwise, it looks like they were doing it.
---
Also the M-2 weights \~80 lbs and a 250 round belt of .50 BMG (which no one makes) would weigh 35 lbs...  Realism means no one would use heavy weapons... ever.
---
You bastage
---
Stop spreading this info
---
&gt;If you are afraid of having a Bounty, and thus of PVP, why are you contesting a Workshop, thus triggering PVP?
---
Problem is, I don't think the new system flags you as wanted. It just forces PvP. But even then, not really. Worst case scenario someone hides in a corner of your build area and "claims" your workshop. Now all your assets are theirs. YOU get wanted for unlocking/opening/damaging your former assets.
---
They made it more griefable.. I cannot believe it.
---
Exact same thing happened to me just a bit ago on Xbox 1. Frustrating. 
---
Way to compare apples to hand grenades.  Melee can get vat crits too you know.
---
That sounds like it was an epic encounter, thanks for sharing this amazing experience.   
---
I came I it with the same mindset as you, past fallout fan, knew all the negatives going in, and I wasn't disappointed.  I just play by myself for the most part unless someone is in the same area as me and think it's fun.  Ask all your game questions on here, people are pretty helpful. 
---
That is part of why I'm kind of boycotting until then. This just confirms they do not test anything. It's not ok.

The only one I have found is in the Hornwright Summer Villa greenhouse. 
---
In a nutshell, yeah. I'll do my business at Watoga station, cross the parking lot and pick off the one by the truck, then pick off the 2-3 in the alley by Phoenix (usu that prompts a mini horde of scorched, ghouls or muties), do my business with the BoS, then head into the two shops 'round the back and pick off those guys, cross over by the diner and up over by the high school and back to the station. There's probably ~10 Protectrons in total and a couple of Mr. Handys the only one that gets aggro'd is the one you're shooting and usually they're dead before they have a chance to react. Generally all level 50 and usually at least 1 will be legendary. And generally because of how the protectrons keep regenerating you can rinse/repeat that run as often as you like but I only do it when I'm in town on business. Worst case scenario you've picked up a few hundred XP and some lead, steel and aluminum with some fusion cells to boot.
---
I know, I have some taking up stash space too.  :)
---
But Lord_Emperor  stated he was a 'really casual player' and that he had hundreds of pounds of the stuff, so it was entirely believable that Mr '900 hours' could easily craft enough ultracite for hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo.
---
Mr 'really casual player' mistook inert flux for stable and 'Mr. 900 Hours' is entirely unbelievable.

Here is the article, the Author was off by 60%+ On what fluxes needed to be collected every day, I've personally made 250+ Violets in a day, with a record of 350, spent doing nothing but server hopping and collecting in the SBQ Area, you can collect 120'ish per hop, and I'm using 2 to 3 accounts, so every 20'ish minutes I was previously collecting between 300 and 360 raw.

I found it. It is indeed available by default and you need Science at rank 2. 
---
On PS4 today gameplay was noticeably *more* choppy for me personally. Tried a few different servers but always felt like I was just about to dc.
---
I have found a few two shot weapons. I just found my second explosive weapon (a scorch killing Gatling gun with explosive effects). I have never found a TSE. I have been playing since beta.
---
TSE got a nerf because a large portion of the players and apparently Beth realized it need it.  Two shot should have been left alone, as having 25% damage and keeping the massive accuracy penalty is just too much.
---

It is confirmed you are wrong. I don‚Äôt have any mods installed. 
---
PS4 here. My Adrenal Reaction isn‚Äôt working. Not sure if I had Rad-Worms or not. I have several other mutations though:
---
Twisted Muscles
---
Plaguewalker
---
Marsupial
---
Unstable Isotope
---
Carnivore
---
Grounded
---
Scaly Skin
---
Chameleon
---
Speed Demon
---
Healing Factor
---
That‚Äôs true too. I keep forgetting vats is in the game tbh
---
More like power leap with some of these folks.
---
I'm not saying I was the only person who can fight them. I was getting at how a lot of the people saying that got banned were people who were fighting them.
---
Well don't give up location or landmarks. What they gonna say, over there by the trees?
---
Is it your first install of the game? Because it was only like 4 gb for me on my PS4. 
---
I was going to do this research and name names but it would probably be labeled as witch hunting.
---
With the mods' blessing I'd look into it more seriously but I don't see much of a point unless I can name exact users full of shit.
---
...oh. I liked to set up my fort camp right on the green because it offered something to run back to if I am getting swarmed.
---
Unsub from r/fo76
---
Nah this works for sure I've done it
---
But Skyrim didn't have Rocket powered hammers.  Or baseball bats with coiled cigarette lighters bolted together.
---
It's not your level.
---
It's the level of the legendary. In this case a level 68.
---
You are really really reaching
---
I went to Camp Venture and was killing the ghouls when they all just died. I was doing the Forbidden Knowledge quest. Then I ran up to the scorched up above, and the same thing happened. No loot though. Just dead as I went to fight them. I swung at one, and they all died.
---
It just sounds like a circle jerk of complaining to me. I went melee early on cause I hated hunting or crafting ammo all the time. It's a pain to run after every single enemy. My best weapon does about 320 damage. But I have to be in PA if I'm in a crowd. And even then.... Today I got slaughtered a few times by a group of mirelurk Kings. 
---
The stuff you see here and other forums. It basically exists in a bubble. you see a few people with crazy builds and think everyone is running that? Nope. Not how it works. 
---
Report for?.. I don‚Äôt think you can get in trouble for being an asshole. I‚Äôd have just left the server as soon as I was one shot. Now if they sent rude messages on Xbox live, then yeah report them. But I mean, come on.
---
I hopped on briefly today to check it out, and the only issue (if you even want to call it that) was the audio seemed choppy at times. The background music (with the radio off) would seem to skip as well as some sound effects. Other than that, it seemed smooth, with quick loading
---
He has been showing up to my camp a ton today which is very close to the Site Alpha launch silo, its quite the sight when the missile comes blasting out.   The first time happened before the patch so I don't think the increased spawn rate effect had come into play yet.    Three additional times after the patch when I fast traveled to my camp.    The last time he showed up to my camp I immediately ran up the road from my camp and another Mothman showed up on that road 30 seconds later.
---
Thank you for all the ballistic fiber! 
---
If they nerf melee the game is done
---
Well, It was better than the other bit or armour i have for my left leg, and since it has a legendary perk attached I can't accidentally scrap it when wearing excavator armour and trying to loose weight.
---
But since I have all sneak perks, and going into sneak is supposed to help loose enemies that had seen me, I had hoped it would increase my chances of getting away enough to shoot them. Or at least if I kill the one near me help those further away and shooting at me might loose me quicker. 
---
(I have yet to loose single enemy since the Jan 29th patch I think. I stopped playing as i kept getting stuck in PA again and I was unable to get cores thanks to them reverting core generators to 0.8 per hour.)
---
I am a sniper build, If I am meleeing enemies, I fucked up. (but I now carry 'all rise' to try and help out because enemies zero in on invisible people sniping from the darkness at night reeeaaaaly quick.)
---
Ok then who told you that you were always only  supposed to get level 50 gear when you kill an enemy 50 and above?
---
Happens if someone has been there and removed their targeting parameters before you.
---
Only problem I had was that it kept forgetting what my backup weapon was.  In under a couple hours of play it forgot that I had my hunting rifle or super sledge set as backup about 6 or 7 times.  Kept on coming up with empty hands.
---
Is that why? I've just level those bases because the 20 turrets firing lag me out.
---
It was mentioned in the patch notes.
---
I was experiencing this last patch as well. Ever since they started messing with rad worms, (that nobody cared about, noticed, or asked for) the mutations and perk cards have been wonky.  Who knew the rad worms disease was somehow tied to everything in the game?! lol! 
---
It was one event they had were if you wore  a piece of a set (grognack, Silver Shroud, etc) in a team your max health would increase by 15 points.  Maxing out at 60 hp.   
---
It isn't that large of an increase and to achieve that you needed 4 people in a team with you. 
---
3.5x if you have the perk that makes silenced weapons do more damage at night. 
---
still cant craft confed though but as mentioned aboe all others showed up
---
My Adrenal Reaction and Marsupial have no positive effects anymore. Fix this ASAP as this is a huge part of my build. 
---
Are you saying that for certain level 40 gear is part of the loot table for &gt;50 enemies? Or are you just trolling?
---
Disappear how? Like right next to you and you can't see them? Or you walk to far away and you lose sight of them?
---
Fair enough tbh I didn't know if they would or wouldn't but figured it wouldn't hurt to take them either way.
---
Honestly, stash size increases are only a temporary solution. There needs to be a change to how junk storage worksalong with a stash size reduction.
---
800 is an insane amount of space IF you factor out junk. 
---
Just looted a drill from a legendary ghoul so they are indeed taking up the slot from the legendary loot.
---
I am saying that I have never heard of this rule that all level 50 and above enemies are supposed to ONLY drop level 50 and above loot. It‚Äôs never been a constant for me, it‚Äôs never been a constant for anyone else in the game either including you. 
---
yeah! THATs true! üôÇ
---
Tbf he's probably posting via Internet Explorer.
---
Unlimited stash would be nice. Or at least allow us to build up to increase stash limit. That said basic carry weight shouldn't' be 800.  The fact you aren't really effected by being over burdened until you hit 1,500 over your max carry makes the game a bit to easy. 
---
Posted this on another thread, figured I would comment it here as well...

**TL:DR**
---
It's also doable with a week's worth or insane work to likely craft that amount of 5mm Ultracite ammo, if that was the goal of a hard core player running multiple accounts, so spread out over time is also inside the range of possible.   
---
irony
---
Boomers are slow folk
---
Honesty is good, But should those who just are victims of picking up too much stuff (especially after the previous patch basically forcing tons of people to drop their ill gotten gains). Not everyone keeps up with this sub, so I kinda have a hard time feeling like those who felt they just got lucky with a jackpot bag in the open world... Considering there's even a bot who tells you that you win the lottery... should be lumped in with those who actually cheated. 
---
But fighting hypocrisy is a really uphill battle. Especially when most of this sub seems to have adopted a "If it isn't affecting me, to hell with them, they probably deserved it" mentality. Or a Bethesda can do no wrong one.
---
Ditto, just -50 HP showing up in Status and NO +Damage on my weapons, any of them.  I logged 4 times so maybe on the 5th it will be ok, or not......./sigh
---
No, that's me. I forgot the week rolled over, and we got new challenges. I still had that this morning when I signed out at 2am, and IT was bugged for me. 
---
I got it from scrapping armor 
---
Yeah add on the gun nerf and you can't do anything.
---
You can avoid it.. Like the guy I pk'd last night at the Poseidon workshop. He made a bed right right in front of the bench and was sleeping! Was 2x my level but he got up and ran without pants on. Made it to the street. I bet he won't be doing that again!
---
Well you can't be one shot if you aren't in PvP with the other player. 
---
The statue doean't need to be destroyed. It has an activation (X on PS4) that triggers its' animation
---
Thank you, just doing what I can to help.
---
celebrate what? the junk loot????
---
If my guess is right, they probably have. They even "fixed" the explosive crate that gave you a bunch of aid items &amp; that safe that often gave you bobby pins in Morgan town airport. Used to walk away with over 10 - 40 stimpaks(and others like decease cures...etc) and 5 - 100 bobby pins almost every time I server hopped.
---
People who volunteerely play fo76 deserve to suffer.
---
nice to see someone is a yongyea fan lol, yeah this was already addressed and corrected by the community weeks ago. Imagine being a fan of that lazy turd yong, yikes.
---
I cannot keep my main 50 cal on the wheel and the one I use for robots in silos is permastuck on 2 
---
Almost every patch more issues arise. 
---
Totally agree. With melee, you do more damage, pay less maintenance, and don't worry about ammo. It is the most powerful build after the TSE nerf.
---
They must buff ranged weapons with a mix of damage, durability and ammunition fixes. 
---
It is complete laziness that melee out damages any heavy weapon build. 
---
The whole TS(e) re-balancing was handle wrong (No offense to anyone) and it didn't address the root balance issues in the first place.   
---
Yes it's silly a bloodied sledge can do 2k, and a powefist build can get to 10k (reportedly)   
---
But the problem isn't melee being OP, its the fact Ranged needs a serious buff. 
---
Yeah, but rad rage builds are the melee problem. Vats rifle crits can drop entire teams out to 100 yards in less than 5 seconds. I watched my buddy do it. The other team got off one shot between the 4 of them.
---
Just reduce the budget for certain items.  5 Turrets shouldn't be half your camp budget. 
---
lol over a single mutation.  BTW, it can't do 'the bulk' of your damage. It can just about double your damage at most, and if you are hardcore bloodied you need a nerf anyways, because the damage is just a little too much with those builds, even with the risks.
---
Ok. Well wood has a unique mod called Shrouded. It makes you move faster while stealthed and harder to detect etc. if I remember correctly. Chameleon is a good stealth legendary also, as it lets you go invisible from just crouching. If you don't have that it's useful mainly in PvP, but I'm pretty sure it adds to stealth detection also. You can get the shrouded wood armor mod plan from the bunker quests. Raleigh Clay's bunker I think. So that's why you might like to try wood. I actually have been collecting some wood legendary pieces, and also have a full set of Chameleon if I remember correctly that I've been collecting from drops. Haven't really tried them out much. I sometimes use just one piece of chameleon if I need to for PvP situations.

I just put my camp on the golf course cuz I liked the flatness of the terrain, it was good to build a little house on.
---
Bold strategy, let's see if it pays off.
---
Real men use artillery 
---
U never know, the bans r temporary and they could release them all anytime. just be patient and let them fix the game.
---
: (
---
Just don't put it where the turrets hit the stuff still at the clubhouse. Particularly don't arrange it so they fire into the back windows, bottom and top levels, constantly spraying everyone and everything. :)
---
Let me guess, only shoot level 15 and under too, am I right?  
---
20% HP. If I get hit basically at all I die. That seems fair to me. 
---
Totally get that. Why don't you just crop the image or take a screenahot with a generic looking backdrop? Thats what I did. 
---
Even if the location is figured out and becomes a hot spot, meh.... ill just move its location. So many awesome spots on the map anyway. 
---
more hitching and micro studding here :(
---
anything that is a plan can not be learned from scrapping

harpers ferry... i think is in the north behind the church next to that small camp on the cliff.
---
will make an screenshot today if youre not able to find it.
---
Dammit that's a nice rifle!  Btw your weight is messed up cause it's looking like a 100-ish lb rifle reduced by 90%, that's some funky Bethesda math lol
---
Thank you! 
---
Twisted Muscles and Talons needs a nerf. Plain and simple. Nerf to 5-10% and itll be fine. 
---
I did two. One was queen of the hunt and another was for the watoga medical place bot to clear squatters. So both would be daily events I believe? 
---
Man, I feel let down now.  I am a solo player, never joined anyone or teams, no idea how many hours I've played.  Got it for a Christmas gift (xbox) I'm somewhere around level 115... I'd have to login and look.  I've never traded or bought anything from another player and never looked into how to dupe anything.  I guess I should have looked into buying one while I could.  
---
I know how to find quests, but of all the times I've been to manongah, it's never popped up for me. One of the design concepts of the game is to flag interesting content for you, so you don't miss it. If it's a daily quest, then the daily quest mechanic is broken, as demonstrated in so many other places in the game üòï I've been missing so much cool stuff, and it's not for lack of trying.
---
do u think this is a correct method to release patches in a 60$ game?????????????  
---
WE R NOT FUCKING BETA TESTERS WE R UR COUSTUMERS!!!!!
---
I mean there is was a mod for it
---
Yeah, sounds fun that way.  
---
Someone mentioned the same thing in another post. I killed it just like another poster, and damn if another one didn't pick it up off his body and start using it again.
---
I've usually made good use of them by spraying a group of ghouls with an auto and kiting them to a kill zone where someone set up a CAMP with turrets. I always figured it was an easy way to kill them without wasting my ammo.
---
Only two shots I ever got over the span of 2 months farming nuked WS are:
---
Black Power Pistol
---
Fat Man
---
LMG
---
Some of them were repeats too.
---
Then a level 30 Nocturnal Combat Rifle that had a explosive effect.
---
And the only TSE I ever got on my own was a Western Revolver
---
This. exactly.
---
Well the reason nobody bothers with uranium fever is because mole miners only spawn up to level 40 which means you can't get max level gear from legendary mole miners.
---
I've been watching for a few weeks now since learning that and I haven't seen anything above level 50 drop anything less than max gear...... until today, which oddly was right after an update.
---
Oh definitely, I had tons lag at work stations, I would select the work station and it would take a bit to actually load it, now it loads immediately 
---
https://imgur.com/w14QI8L.jpg
---
Cool, thanks. I don't have any wood armour recipes. Though I prefer having legionaries due to them not appearing in the scrap option window when i am wearing PA. Have lost good bits thinking they were spare due to them not having an being worn indicator.
---
Do you know if chameleon stacks? (ie, 2 bits gives even better stealth?)
---
Oops lol. This was me tonight! Sorry everyone who was on my server. 
---
I play solo and have such a hard time levelling up that I hit as many ghouls as I can with one shot to help with XP.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm at the awkward teen stage of level because all my enemies are significantly higher and the armour/hazmats/literally anything I pick up is unusable until level 50. So I‚Äôm trying to get to level 50 as quickly as possibly so I can use 90% of my stash. 
---
900 hours, did you lose a bet
---
Any luck having the same issues? 
---
Got a 2-shot Automatic Shotgun.
---
I have no shotgun perks.
---
Maybe that's what happened to me cause I thought at 1 time in between scorchedbeast kills I had all the scorched dead but maybe not idk. When that damn thing started hitting me all I could do was hit a stim and move out the area and try to locate the issue but sadly it didn't work fawker got me twice and the area was clear on my next respawn. Still kinda pisses me off I want a rematch damn it
---
I just use a suppressed hardened lever action, mister sandman, all rifle perks, and max sneak and just do vats headshots.  Everything except scorchbeasts dies in one shot.  With instigating dragon, even death claws go down in one hit.  Not sure how much more power I need when one shot is already killing everything as fast as I can pull the trigger.  
---
Ha no. With optimal sentinel gear, you can face tank anything at 20% health, as long as you got a rad shield going and a order of mysteries mask. Sure, there's still risk, but not like that.
---
JUst a q to both of you talking in here.  Why do you give the benefit of the doubt? In 99% of the cases the ban is proven and upheld.  
---
Great patch. Still waiting for word on how you are going to fix the disparity between ranged and melee that you created with the last nerf. Or should we all just go melee now? 
---
You do know that the SBQ always recovers uts health at 50% to full health, the same goes for any three star legendary.
---
and real soldiers use both 
---
Only in that small part of the state are they gone due to scorch beasts . theyre not dead everywhere
---
They said they will release the accounts in a future update. I have no worry that we're permanently banned, especially since when I got hit myself, my stash was just organized and I'm still about 60 lbs free on my toon. I also use melees, so I've just been running around PvPing before TSE was even nerfed. I'm just unsure what I picked up, I just know I'm guilty by association lol
---
On a side note, was the bug while wearing underarmor with stats causing the PA frame to disappear ever fixed?
---
&gt;my pure melee build with a 3* legendary grognak's tops out at like 250 damage.
---
If you have 15 points in strength it does 268 damage as its an 80% increase on the base damage. Also if you're a "pure melee" build I assume you're running maxed versions of slugger, expert slugger and master slugger for an additional 20% each respectively. Try to be more thoughtful when you spew pure lies seriously. 
---
Well some people got a follow up email apparently that said they dupped over 1,000,000 rare items in a 30 day period and their account was banned. so it might just be that they had accounts flagged as possible duppers for gathering 100,000 rare items in 30 day and suspended until they could actually look into it, which might also explain the "no appeals" part.
---
of course you dont sound like you were caught up in it, and I havent really seen a lot of "i was banned" posts today so they might have lifted it with this patch for all I know. If they havent Bethesda really should give a time frame no later than the next inside the vault (and even waiting that long is pushing it)
---
You‚Äôre speaking to the 1%ers. Oh, and they‚Äôre not rich, they‚Äôre the 1% of players who enjoy the game. Nothing you say will get through to them and they‚Äôll hang on you faster than a pack of wolves
---
ghouls are one shoot, best place to farm chems. and junk.
---
Build a nice pc and play with your xbox or ps4 controller with full support. You get 60fps smooth and no nonsense that u get on console. Also plug your pc into hdtv like i did and never ever look back
---
I've had a bug happen before where the SBQ was suppose to do that jump attack that SBs normally do when on the ground, but instead of doing that she just kept backing up until she got close to Watoga and just did that none stop going in circles from there. We never finished it because of that, and not to mention that for some reason we barely did any damage(We had 12 people that were all level 100+, I'm lvl 223). Worse part is that was before Today's patch.
---
Seriously tho, I have no ban email, but I cant log in atm. Like when they unlock my account why even bother coming back. The community here is cancer AF. I hate the duping that sideswept the game too. A ton of the bad reviews are from stability issues. My own brother and roommate, who loves fallout, started the game with me and wont give it a chance now because of all his DC's (which were probly to blame from dupers). I got my dick kicked in by TSE before I even knew duplication was a thing, and lost thousands of caps over workshop battles I had no chance of winning. I fucking picked up a baggy of bobbleheads that a "friend" of mine had dropped for a queen run. I got sloppy, and said "fuck it, so many using this to get ahead and so i'll use them for this run". It was my 1st queen run, I popped like 30 of them sum' bitches, immediately dropped them for anyone else and went on to finish the queen run. That alone got me the suspension. All in all, I can understand whats happening and I don't disagree with it, Im just livid pissed that if I didn't go online and see the community gather all the info and tell me what was going on, that I would be totally left in the dark about this! No response from support tickets, no email of any action taken on my account. And I lashed out immediately in a desperate attempt to understand, and was just deemed a fucking liar, having a few people literally just come to my post to tell me im a piece of shit and I deserve everything. Its like jesus man, I get it don't fucking touch the baggies for real, but is all this aggro really necessary? 
---
I can't say for sure as I haven't really done any testing but I imagine they would.
---
Thanks for the info, I was about to try removing and re-applying. Would have wasted a lot of time and caps. Upvoted.
---
Weeks ago I had to reset my all mutations because some of them weren't showing up. Using boring non serum way it took hours but  got everything I needed. Serums can screw up sometimes. Effects are probably there but I had to make sure. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_primary_statistics
---
Thanks for the support. People really underestimate how easy it is to farm in this game. 
---
I'm still pretty sure their system is not correct. Did you trade the ammo to your mules or drop it in containers and pick it up?
---
Same, then everyone started nuking it.
---
thnx  all.good i found some in gauley mine
---
Yes, why did we even create a character name?
---
ACtually I guarantee according to their TOS they own the game, the server and your character and can ban you for any reason at any time no proof needed.
---
How you getting damage numbers like that? All rifleman perks, nerd range, adrenal, and what else?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/apsa27/my_unique_camp_build_3/?st=JSCP8744&amp;sh=4c646bd1
---
And no turrets pointed at the Golf Club?
---
Like right next to you but you cant see them, but they can see you or vice versa. Happens when you both fast travel or load into a new area, something like that. Have to log out and log back in to fix it, if it doesn‚Äôt work then the other person tries. 
---
Why not try Anthem?
---
Its looking to be a better Warframe.  From what I've played.
---
Flying is very cool.  
---
I had to give up on Fallout 76 over a month ago.  When I couldn't stand all the time waiting for bugs to be fixed.
---
IT'S FUCKING YOU'RE.
---
It‚Äôs still working for me. I haven‚Äôt relogged yet, but upon curing and reapplying it started working again. 
---
No... well maybe. I haven‚Äôt used it in a long time. But it seems popular with Fo76 players. I‚Äôll have to look into it.
---
Which heavy gun do you use?
---
This is my experience as well. Hoping to get some extended play in this week to really test it out.
---
Played all day today and it works fantastic 
---
this company is a shame.
---
I like running up and breaking everything with my axe if they are back there. Especially if the damn rocket launcher turrets are going off.
---
All the armor I‚Äôm wearing is farmed from whitesprings long after I turned  level 50 and the highest piece of armor I have on is level 45.
---
As a test I just did uranium fever and a level 40 legendary mole miner just dropped a level 35 legendary life saving trapper chest piece
---
Then I just killed a level 67 legendary feral ghoul at white springs and got a level 45 two shot 50 cal machine gun
---
This is the norm for me. I very rarely ever have a level 50 anything drop
---
Tedious isn't it?
---
Nope... they take up too much space any how. There are two turrets inside the building to shoot any monsters trying for the stairs. 
---
Solid square for current. empty for will reequip even leaving PA
---
You don't need the atx ba2 files anymore. Bethesda merged those into the main ones
---
They may not make it to FO5. I pre-ordered FNV to get the deluxe set, waited in line at Game Stop for FO4, and pre-paid for FO76 for PS4 and PC. The kids played the PS4 version for about a week and gave up on it. They said PvP is better with Black Ops, and Fortnight. My youngest son played all of the Fallout games since we have them all in anticipation of FO76. He lasted longer than my older son who said it sucked after a couple of hours.
---
I will not pre-order, or pay for FO5 until I see the reviews, and see about trying to play it first. If it is like FO76, then I will not buy it. 
---
**Too bad about PS4. The Better Inventory mod does what you are looking for. I feel your pain.**
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that?
---
That isn‚Äôt character development, just asset reuse. She skis because they already had ski posters
---
Yeah I'm aware of that though I have done quite a few of these and never failed to down her. It was really weird like some changes have been made to the SBQ . But as I said my main complaint was the gameplay.
---
I said it myself that his build is not very good. it's just so people can get a general idea.
---
what is fix it only till next login...
---
Bitches gotta cry about something.
---
Here's my move... Shoot robots then hide behind their stuff.  The robots always shoot the objects in front of you.  I've destroyed multiple structures like this without being wanted.
---
Was that Xbox? Because if it was, I was there and mayhem was beyond word of the day! 
---
We just need a lot more people per server, so it feels like there actually are people.
---
Bethesda never said Humans will never be NPCs.
---
Stop beating a dead horse.
---
Cool, I have a mic but haven't used it in this game. I'll give that a shot tonight if my update ever finishes on the PS4 :)
---
did you really just post the same reply 3 times? and now you're essentially proving that I'm right, that melee is op?
---
I mean, fine by me. but can you even read?
---
That's not what was sent at all. The message was that they accumulated 100k items in 30 day period. Meaning via trade or pickup or dupe. If you think this many ppl were duping you kidding yourself your highness. Anyone with mules, all the duper hunting groups that picked up baggies or ppl helping transfer large quantities of items were hit with a temporary suspension. No real time frame has been given so I'd agree, they will pry take a week or so to address the situation. No progress this patch, better luck next time. 
---
As a NOVA native, thats news to me. Is that just 64? I used to speed through 81 and 64 when visiting home from Blacksburg. 
---
Lolz your right ;)
---
Yep just letting those know that dont read the patch notes or just skimmed it.
---
sorry your own (and your fellow vault dwellers) survival isnt a grand enough rpg goal.
---
I just downvote everything.   The whine of the week is andrenal something or another, I see it just downvote.  Move on.  Literally nothing anyone in this sub can say or post is going to sway me from playing fo76 or any other bethesda title so its just about handing out downvotes like they are going out of style.
---
It's my response to the stupid.
---
I ran away after since I was using plasma and gatling lasers which I wanted to use on the SBQ before they broke. A melee guy came along and started killing the local scorched and fauna for me.
---
BTW I died twice during the fight today too. First time in a long time. I would have died 3x, but someone revived me when I called for help.
---
Sorry I missed you. I can only make Adrenal serums, as it's the only plan I have for serums. The plans are horrifically expensive, but I lucked out and got a serum recipe drop from the queen. I would be happy to sell you a cheap adrenal serum, but be aware that people have been reporting that it is bugged in more ways than just having to re-apply it:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asirlq/do\_not\_remove\_and\_reapply\_adrenal\_reaction\_once/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asirlq/do_not_remove_and_reapply_adrenal_reaction_once/)
---
If you would still like one, PM me and I will meet up with you some time tomorrow afternoon. But I would hold on to the serum and not use it till the devs hotfix the bug it currently has. :)
---
I‚Äôm not counting on them answering any of the banned tickets other than you have to wait for a future update...lol
---
It's not even that. The whole premise of everyone died right before you show is just stupid. I mean it's fine for a quest or two or even a line of side quests, but to base the whole game around reading terminal entries and listening to half baked audio logs is asinine.
---
Then nerf sentinels. Because at the moment Bloodied adrenal is the only things that stands a chance against it. TSE couldnt streak that crap before the damage nerf. 
---
what are these orbital strikes you speak of? where can we get this ability?
---
Here is an idea... you could just politely ask them to stop.  I used to do that because I was new and had no idea what it was doing.  I had a bunch of people wreck my camp and attack me.  Still had no idea.  Then a guy got on area and asked me nicely to stop and told me why.  So I did and I apologized for it.  Or you could be the same kind of ass that puts turrets up and whack on them and their camp.
---
I am 100% in favor of you taking a long walk off a short pier. 
---
Bug Report: The area above the codpiece on the X-01 when using mothman paint shows the missing texture pink squares. (Platform: PS4)
---
The goal is to be so high on your chems that you forget about your food/drink and drift asleep 
---
I was on PC and it was hell on earth. Players were throwing everything at it to little effect. Then the fing game would freeze for the tenth time.
---
So if we only get a bounty if we destroy their shit, can we damage it greatly without destroying it, then position the ghouls to finish the job?
---
And then they spent 20 caps moving their camp away and back, rebuilding all destroyed items without using a single resource.
---
I can understand the lore. I personally want NPC‚Äôs, but at least they made a half assed attempt to explain it. HOWEVER, I think they can fix this with ghoul or SM NPCS. They only said humans, hell we could even have a non feral ghoul companion.
---

Believe it or not the fact that you keep repeating about not being able to track an individual item ID is not conclusive proof. It is a factor but it absolutely does not prove that dropping and picking up the same items over and over again would flag someone. Actually dropping and picking up ultracite ammo or passing it back and forth with a friend to get 100000 "acquisitions" and getting banned would be proof.
---
A very simple way to tell that there is more going on here than what you're implying are all the problems that there have been from crafting and how much crafting lags a server. If crafting an item was just adding one to the number of that particular item you were carrying there's absolutely no reason that there would be lag problems. That is actual evidence that there is more going on in the client-server relationship than you are implying. Not proof, mind you because I'm not a silly person who states things as facts when they can't be proven and are based in assumptions and incomplete knowledge, but definitely some solid evidence.
---
Stash and carry weight being another performance issue also does not support the argument that everything is simply being tracked the way you imply. 
---
While you assume that I am saying Bethesda did something right, what I really think is that they did actually add (or try to) some of these things and they simply aren't working right, were/are too taxing on the client or server side to completely enable, or it generates too much data to actually log and parse with reasonable cost.
---
That is neither here nor there though because all along I have said your concepts are also very viable, just not proven and making some assumptions that are ignoring a lot of potential even bigger fuckups.
---
I definitely think that there is something to the theory that the same items going back and forth between two characters 10000 times could trigger this ban. I don't know if that would necessarily apply to items that you dropped say yourself and then pick up. They may for example be able to track the items are coming out of a bag that you dropped or that you put items into a container and you're taking them out.
---
One thing we know for sure is they cannot track who created an item for the bands would have been much easier and quicker.
---
Apparently, you can ask them to tell you what items triggered the ban, and they will actually tell you.
---
Most tickets even put in on Saturday haven‚Äôt even been looked at. 
---
If you want to play still with a new character create a new email and a new character on your console, open up the game and it will register that new email now you can play again... new character but at least you‚Äôre playing!
---
Mothman predicted a flood.  Guess it's a flood of ban salt.

Well the squatter bots is an actual MISC quest, like on the SIDE or MAIN tabs, so let's stay away from that for now, for simplicity.
---
Queen of the Hunt, just looked it up, is on the DAILY tab. The Messenger I see now is on my EVENT tab.
---
So, this is either bugged, or DAILY events don't count, only the stuff on the EVENT tab. 
---
Super easy EVENT is the teapot down by Poseidon, or Collision Course at Morgantown airport with all the scorched going for your airdrop, or Back on the Beat where you escort the Responder Protectron, many others. Im at work but used the FO Wiki for the list: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_quests#Event\_quests](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_quests#Event_quests)
---
Any chance you (or anyone) who isnt getting the event challenge completed can try only EVENTS from this wiki list?

Thanks for the warning. Holding off until this is dealt with.
---
You posted that fake video 3 times. Stop spreading lies. You should have noticed how many dislikes that video has for starters and anyone who actually plays the game would immediately notice he's not dropping the queens health at all, nothing close to 15k damage. Are you trolling or just dense? 
---
This is where I messed up. Pvm at Whitesprings, found a bag, took all. I noticed a lot of bulk right away, but after I picked it up I was over 800lbs on my character. Got to safety and saw that it had hundreds of flux, died an hour later and lost everything in a bush. I was slightly devastated, but thought that it was for the best. The next day I found a lot of junk in a sack in Watoga and picked it up. Nowhere near what I picked up the day before though, and  I bulked it and sold it on my vendor runs that day. I wish I hadn't been so stupid because I'm seriously missing the game right now. 
---
Oh, I get it! Irony!
---
I was referencing the follow up email some players got that rather and just being suspended for have 100,000 the next email was they were permanently banned for having 1,000,000
---
That is GREAT to hear!!! 
---
I‚Äôll see if I can relocate that and post the link.
---
Looks like fun!!!! 
---
So, question about this mutation: does adrenal reaction trigger based off of  
---
    (current health)/(max health)  
---
or off
---
    (current health)/(max health - current rads)
---
?
---
Certain weapons/armor go 15/25/35/45. Trapper armor from a level 50+ would drop as 45 (max level).
---
Some items like the ripper max cap at 40.
---
A mole Miner would drop level 35 trapper armor because there is no such thing as level 40 trapper armor. The next level is 45 which a level 40 can't drop.
---
I built my camp there as a trade shop ‚ÄúSpyLord‚Äôs Specialty‚Äôs‚Äù
---
That's not an exploit.  An exploit is using a game mechanic in an unintended manner that produces unexpected results outside what the developer intended.  Characters carry items, that's a normal function of the game.  Bethesda did introduce a max capacity for characters, but it was because of duping and not muling.
---
Bethesda absolutely knew people would offload items to mules as it's been done since forever in multiplayer games.  There's a difference between mules and the stash.  The stash can be accessed at various places, like red rocket, and crafting materials inside it are available for use.  Muled items are not, they're basically cold storage and can't be immediately used.  They're functionally very different.
---
So yes, people have infinite storage, but not accessible from any one character at any given time.
---
Ironically I‚Äôm reading that a lot of the actual duper‚Äôs are still playing and escaped with out even a slap on the wrist! 
---
So they lost a few weapons but got to keep 1? 
---
Way better than not playing at all...
---
I'm off for tonight but I'll gladly try some more tomorrow and let you know how it goes. Thanks for the info. 
---
If I could see them I might buy them.
---
I feel for you man. Me too. I have no reason to doubt your case. Guess we both get some time out to think about what we did and also maybe just interact with strangers and random baggies less often if at all. 
---
That‚Äôs what it did to me but once I relived it disappeared 
---
Or even better. non-combat perks should be passive
---
Yeah I it was weird dying for sure. Then I put my x01 armor on figuring that would save me well that was a fail I think I died faster then with my combat armor ffs
---
Ok I didn‚Äôt know this. Makes sense now why I never found it weird that I never get level 50 armor
---
This is exactly what I'm getting at. Thank you for understanding. 
---
I really am enjoying the lore of Fallout. It‚Äôs always the little things that are the best. Almost every little corner of the game tells a story.
---
I‚Äôm a bigger fan of this kind of story telling in fallout compared to the traditional character driven storytelling featured in the previous games. Talking to NPCs was a pain.
---
Muling is an exploit, just because alot of people do it and have been doing it for a long time doesnt make it not an exploit. If you create an alt account so you can have a bigger stash, thats an exploit.
---
All these people have to do is play the game like a normal person and you wont get banned.
---
This happens to me all the time. I was at Whitespring taking down some ghiuls and just bloop! Back to Dash. Then later I was getting into my PA and Freeze! Back to Dash. I stopped playing that day. 
---
The point is that he's not actually hitting for 15k even if his inventory says it is. The queens health is dropping as if he's hitting for less than 1k per swing, which is average for a bloody gauntlet in a mediocre build. YOU just can't tell the difference because you don't have enough experience killing queens, you simply trusted the video and preached it as gospel. 
---
The recent patch fixed a lot however the ability to place your built camp is slightly bugged... More than likely they spent 40 caps to move each time (and even though it says 40 caps it can cost up to 160 without mentioning it)... So basically they might have to rebuild the camp of they do that. 
---
It‚Äôs awesome of you to help but it doesn‚Äôt seem that the fix works does it? After you relog it‚Äôs broken again. 
---
What he said ^
---
Well, that is cool, but as someone else said here, the salt level is so high that pretty much even benevolent camps will always be destroyed. And, one of the vendors in Whitespring is effectively a CAMP anyway, most go there after a run. It could be good for lowish level guys running away from group attacks though.
---
I had no idea such a thing existed.
---
Definitely decided I won't ever pick up another loot bag unless I look through it first, and I have refused to trade with people I can't trust for the past two months. 
---
I hope we're able to get our accounts back soon, but until then, as I said before, I'll do some spring cleaning in my home. Haha
---
Oh wow. I didn't even know something like that was possible lol.
---
While that does seem interesting I think I may take this opportunity to play other games, but I do appreciate the advice!
---
I just linked the video as a reference for melee builds so people would know it's possible to hit for 5k. I don't really care either way, just wanted to illustrate melee is op.
---
you seem to have a problem with me or the author or the video. you should know I have no idea who you are and/or that I can use your video for future reference, if that will make you stop squirming. melee remains op regardless.
---
Oh boy more title gore
---
Don't like it don't watch it. I think he's right.
---
No 
---
Ill try the tech data route, thanks.
---
Your roof lol, wtf...
---
The ban was based off what the guy had collected in one month not all 900 hours of play. I would love to see you getting 300+ stable flux in one day though.
---
Most weapons are still pretty much useless. Meh.
---
Enclave missions
---
I had no clue a following up email existed. Did Bethesda mentioned this somewhere or did someone throw up a post about recieving this email?
---
You can always just have a camp without turrets, mine doesn't need any
---
My main chest piece out of PA is Marine with Regenerating, lighter weapons, and +1 INT.  Almost a shame I don't crawl out of the tin can much anymore...
---
Yea I have to stop playing with certain ppl that I went on that queen run with. Just not worth it. Gunna have to play solo, they was my clan that took me in to do queen runs. 
---
Thanks for this, was on today and everything seemed more spongy than normal, just checked and this is the reason why. No way am I trying the recommended fix though, I can see that going spectacularly wrong.
---
I won't say that the trading discord is a den of iniquity. I will say that a lot of people are trading for and passing on possibly duped items, as a mater of course. 
---
Also, I'm discussing the game since launch, not as it stands NOW. These decisions, these duped items, these purchases, happened. A snapshot, today, of exactly what the market place looks like is immaterial to the discussion at hand. 
---
In the very recent past, you, factually speaking, could not do a trade and know for a fact that the item you were getting was not duped. Further, you know the possibility is there that it was. That's...just reality, the market is what it is, major guns, sure, but also materials, serums, mods. 
---
I honestly suspect that this will be good for the market, and the game, over-all...I'm significantly more interested in dipping my toe in now that it's _not_ a bunch of duped shit. 
---
OMG! The Mothman event is letting kill the Mothman more often, Ballistic farming here i go. OMG! The last event lets us get the 5% XP bonus for an extra hour by being Well Slept. OMG! The event from 3 weeks ago let us get +15 health per teammate while wearing the Unstoppables outfits. If you're going to complain about a game that you seem to not play anymore, educate your self in the subject. Red Dead Online was complete shit, but you don't see me subscribed or posting on their reddit. Let the people be and if you can't, well that's a whole nother issue  that will need facing sooner or later. Stop letting your brain be infiltrated by negativity brother, look for the bright side, it will help you.
---
I don‚Äôt get it... a player I play with quite a bit just a few minutes ago a player at White Springs was dropping all types of stuff and a lot of it 
---
One bag he looked at had 100+ 3star combat armor stuff and a ton of random ammo... but he didn‚Äôt take any knowing people been getting banned for doing so. 
---
Duper‚Äôs still on is wrong, of Bethesda can see someone had unique rare items they should be able to tell who is overweight pretty easily and look at them. 
---
At the armor workbench select craft, then there's different categories, check headwear. And the face paint is applied by using R1 on your map screen to access the change appearance menu. Color of face paint can be changed also üòÄ
---
Damn dude that was sick.
---
You are a decent human. 
---
We put there after doing a bunch up killing at the gulf course only to have my last power armor core go caput. Running to white springs over encumbered  with no power armor towing a low level in my wake and trying to keep him alive when he constantly kept doing what I told him not to do wasn‚Äôt sounding appealing.  
---
Per the description (and my limited testing) they needed to be _different outfits_. This affect was, as far as I'm aware, unavailable if you did not pay atoms for suits, further, if you did not buy DIFFERENT suits than your friends. 
---
Yeah it has to be on same Xbox as your main live account, it works because I did it and already level 7 starting new! lol
---
I made a decontamination shower and labeled the building with neon, "free decontamination shower"...... I agree with OP but people read something like this and destroy my camp (it's happened 3 times so I moved)...... I just wanted to save people some Radaway but fuck me I guess (turrets were inside to catch a stray ghoul and couldn't shoot out)
---
someone posted a copy of the email, same way we got views of the first one.
---
there was also the one where they actually got bethesda to list off what he had and he had over 300K ultricite rounds and was still only suspended.
---
I've had that happen once usually leaving an area fixes it but not had it in nearly a month with my wife. 
---
Yeah, griefers are the second biggest curse on this game. Toxic sacks of shit who get their fun by making the game less fun for others? The fucks wrong with you, dude? 
---
No problem, but remember me if you need something. I deal only in legitimate, non-duped, fair priced stuff and won't bullshit you. Hence my warning instead of just dumping a currently broken item on ya'. ;)
---
Depending on the situation. Normally my gatling gun is the go-to. Just for ammo conservation and damage output. But the .50 Cal I use for big tough enemies (scorchbeasts, mobs, behemoths, etc.) 
---
Whitesprings is still a good XP farm despite the nerf. Personally I like to farm West Tek, less XP but way better loot. 1 - 3 spawns are usually legendaries and super mutants are just more fun to fight then ghouls. The south east part of the Bog and train yard is good too.
---
does orbital strike land you wanted bounty? do you need to first mark them with the other orbital thing?
---
When I was a lower level being swarmed by ghouls and running for dear life, an on-course camp actually saved me, I was stoked. 
---
The real question is why did you use your real name when creating an account name?
---
Like, that‚Äôs internet rule #1. Never use your real name if you don‚Äôt have to.
---
And its why you got an upvote, is a good thing for us all to push for
---
Yeah I just learned this a few weeks ago from someone on here. I avoid mole miners like the plague now..... LOL.
---
For me Mothman corpses are disappearing
---
Oh okay. I guess I have to keep an eye out for that post. I didn't know people were receiving those emails.
---
Also, are you referring to the 900+ hour guy? I remember seeing someone from Bethesda replying about that. 
---
hardly, i only got one piece
---
What‚Äôs wrong with this? I love it: I sit up on their turret platform tagging ghouls, letting the turrets kill them, then reaping the loot rewards. Makes it easier than wading in manually and having to spam stimpaks!
---
Does this cause some problem I haven‚Äôt realized?
---
I changed the people I played with, deleted a bunch of people after I was given duped guns, I didn't want to be associated with them and they didn't actually care that I had left, and then my old crew that I played with after the first crew all stopped playing after the TSE nerf because they had all bought guns. The group I play with now are amazing though and I'm missing them loads.  
---
What the hell are you talking about, you have no experience playing this game if you think those things are true. You link fake videos and post fake facts all over the forums and have the audacity to complain when called out on it. 5k is a sneak attack crit from a 2.5k weapon. nobody and I mean nobody is hitting for 5k+ normal swings on a bloodied build. 
---
Keep using mods.  I don't care.  It's your monitor that has purple stuff instead of textures due to the mods.
---
This happens to be regularly, I thought it was just my internet being crap and not seeing things fighting each other. 
---
Ah shit, I botched it.  Got a botched toe!
---
Yeah don't even understand why they're apparently just permabanning people for this. Like just throw a month ban at them and call it a lesson learned. Honestly I thought just removing the duped items like they did at first was good enough assuming they fixed the exploits. Oh well, I guess. Hopefully you can get your account back though.
---
This game is such a joke.
---
Lol that's pretty good to know. If the suspensions continue pass a couple of months I may try that, but till then I appreciate the information!
---
Clicked on title expecting pedantic literal answers, was not dissapointed. No need to add my own.
---
I walked by someone's camp today and one (just one of the four) turrets started shooting me.
---
No, I absolutely agree. Melee should either do less damage, or guns should do more. Preferably guns doing more, and a slight nerf on melee.
---
Running my second character, melee feels like its way too easy - no ammo concerns, rare repair, and fucktons of damage. Really puts the difficulty of early game into perspective playing as a non-melee build.
---
yep that was him, now he is a meme apparently.
---
also [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as1v7c/got_2_emails_from_bethesda_telling_me_different/) of the emails and [the image](https://imgur.com/a/RF90OmX) if you dont want the post.

Totally worth it.

queue sad trombone
---
Shit man thats awesome! Makes my CAMP look like it was built by a 5 year old lmao
---
LOL thank you for making me laugh out loud 
---
I wonder if its '3D' splashing of water made of like 8 2d splashes? Kinda reminds me of the fake 3d in 90's games where the graphics would turn with the character. Maybe im seeing something else tho
---
I now notice I can create halloween masks at the Armor workbench.
---
They sell for 11 caps. That's way the fuck more than anything else on average. I should make &amp; sell these like crazy.
---
It's not bad, wrong, or inappropriate. some people feel entitled, feeling that by their mere presence alone, you're not allowed to make the most use of your camp farm experience effectively. The people that burn camps to the ground for sitting up next to White springs are assholes.
---
And you are indeed resisting any actual points he is making, dodging all logic and history of the company and stubbornly denying any and all possibility other than thousands of players were duplicating hundreds of thousands of items and sitting on it till this last maint.
---
Right.
---
Really like the way you angled the Camp for the view and used the barn set. Pretty sweet!
---
I literally do not believe that. People are full of shit. I don't know why people on here are so quick to just take people at their word. 
---
You don‚Äôt need the scanner. 
---
The scanner targets an enemy for orbital strike, without the scanner the beacon itself is the target. 
---
Mind elaborating? Do you mean the Clean/Dirty Straight jacket variants? Or that there are 2 versions of dirty?
---
Besides by disrupting performance and stability for everyone else in the server?
---
By giving you trade advantages, empowering you and your team if applicable to hold public workshops more easily by being better armed and armored and able to craft more defenses, and to outgun other players trying to get a shot in on enemies so they can get some loot at sometimes-competitive spots like Whitespring.
---
Unlimited resources disrupt the entire player economy. Flooding a game with tons of valuable items has many effects that trickle down, especially when only certain players (dupers) get those items. Even if it didn't directly hurt other players it would still be an advantage they don't have, and thus an unfair advantage.
---
I did not ever say it would ruin the game for me. It's up to me how I let such things affect my enjoyment of the game. But the fact that I choose to let dupers ruin the game for me does not make duping okay. Do you think players should be allowed to dupe as they please?
---
It's not a bad game but playing with friends will made it way better
---
Videos about complaining get more views than pozitive ones best you can do is dislike it an hopfully youtube stops recomending it
---
I picked up a dropped bag from pvp. Became overweight and was like "wtf". Went through all the shit and most was normal but there was a stack of over 100k bobbleheads. Dropped them. So am I supposed to admit for my aweful cheating? 
---
Right. You guys are on point with your arguments. 
---
Yeah, I definitely saw that post and didn't realize it became a meme tho. That's rough.
---
And I appreciate it! That definitely saved me some type looking through several post. I can't imagine have a million items. That's crazy
---
It wasn't pay to win at all. You got the same benefits from the super hero outfits you get in the base game. You even get one from probably one of the best quests in the game, the others you can get fairly easily if you Google where to find them. The two costumes added to the Atom Store were included for the 'event' as well. Plus it only gave you a buff if you were using it in a team, and good luck fighting the Queen wearing super hero costumes lol.
---
Remove all weapons from the game.
---
Nerf everything to do as much dmg as Commie Whacker.
---
The immense stockpile of duped goods as well as the process of duping itself has caused tremendous stability and performance issues for other players.
---
Made abundantly clear as Bethesda has been trying to make the game run better for months but nothing had such an huge positive effect as when they slashed hard how much people could go overweight, and going after dupers and duping methods.
---
The issues with duping are more than just an unfair advantage, it's been an integral part in diminishing other players gameplay enjoyment. Even if said player never directly interacted with a duper.
---
Melee also takes more damage.  We should highlight that point. But even more so we should highlight how easy it is to keep track of ammo and weapon durability. 
---
I can confirm orbital strikes give you a bounty üòÇ
---
bug? or feature?
---
dont fall in a fissure again, lesson learned
---
Oh you mean how they were shown in the E3 demo?
---
I don't remember needing to steal armor only the launcher.
---
I would love a detailed explanation of what you did everyday to get enough steel/lead/gunpowder/flux to produce all this ammo.
---
Thank you! I keep getting tempted to move to a better place for fast travel purposes but I love the view and resources near by. 
---
&gt;as many as 150 stable flux at one go
---
100 stable flux means you need 1000 raw? if super duper gives you 30%, you still need 770 raw? how do you collect that before they go inert?
---
Dunno, but I'm going to take advantage. A friend was selling marine armor helmets for even more per.
---
Unfortunately that hasn‚Äôt worked for the gf and I :( we have to always log out and back in. We‚Äôre on Xbox though so maybe it‚Äôs worse on there. 
---
Gave em a chance. Didn't turn out so great. 
---
What is it with you idiots? It doesn't matter if it was \_only for the event\_. it was a bonus exclusive for people who purchased atom shop content, which is something that was stated would \_never\_ be a thing.   
---
It's a small betrayal of that promise, but it absolutely was a betrayal of the promise. 
---
That would explain the lack of deep pocket mod for leather armor.
---
Sometimes quests won't load properly. Like, you won't have done them, but they won't load into your quest list and won't update if you complete them. This *very* often happens to that particular quest to steal from a Supermutant camp. Logging out and back in usually fixes it, but you have to do the quest over.
---
Haven't played in a while, why is this a bad thing? 
---
I think it's still working though, even though the display is totally screwed up in the Pip-Boy. See my response to snappzero's question.
---
Thanks. Wish this was documented in the help files.
---
One of the signs that your in a cult is when you brand every single person who goes against your groupthink a cheater or liar.
---
They raid other settlements for supplies. Raiders is a good short hand for then.
---
At least you get to play...  I have to say it‚Äôs kinda nice having quests to do again! 
---
So Speed Demon doesn't stack with a gun with a faster firing rate? 
---
It‚Äôs not a bug you can learn the Halloween costume plans if you know where to look for them
---
God reading this back gave me ebola.
---
Imagine thinking having optional voice chat would make your game worse and that discord is a work around.
---
How are you supposed to discord chat with someone if you can't fucking get their discord because they can't communicate with you.
---
Actually autistic. 
---
Can orbital strike beacons be equipped for the Last Laugh perk?
---
xD
---
In headwear, I can craft:
---
* Civil War Era Tophat
---
* Halloween Costume Skull
---
* Halloween Costume Witch Hat
---
* Union Hat
---
I cannot craft the Confederate Hat. In fact, the other day I read the plan, but it glitched and then showed up in my inventory as unread. The Small Water Purifier plan did that too. I think the plan is glitched so the Confederate Hat cannot be learned.
---
I can still craft the Marine Armor Helmet.
---
I don't know what outfit/craftable they removed in patch 6. Anyone know?
---
That's definitely the truth! One of biggest mistakes in Fallout were doing quest too early. It was nice having the Perfect Storm as a level 13, but now I kinda of wish I did that quest a bit later in my playthrough lol
---
I've one shot people with crafted guns, and I'm a melee-build. Players are squishy.
---
Once I launch a nuke, then the game will be complete. I had so many server stability issues where I got half-way though quests to only get kicked (daily ones for example) that I decided to hold off. Once I launch it, then I think I will have really nothing else to play for.
---
The factions are empty husks. As you mentioned, the people are all dead. I loved the Mistress of Mystery quest line. I completed it, and then.... 
---
Yup nothing. I was hoping that there would be more. No raiders... no more quests.
---
I love the BoS. I was so excited to get into Fort Defiance. Then I did the DMV crap (now I find it funny, but I didn't at the time), to finally get into the fort. Was there something like a uniform issue, weapons issue, or BoS paint for your armor... nope. 
---
You complete the quest to Paladin Taggerdy to get the ultracite armor. Quest complete. Then they have a daily quest (never been able to complete), but everyone is dead so what is the purpose? Forbidden knowledge is OK, but after doing it for more than 200x, I have still never gotten anything but BoS Initiate paint scheme. I have gotten some uniforms in multiple duplicates. BTW Army fatigues should NOT be on the loot list. The lore on the holotapes says that they don't want to be associated with the US military. 
---
There should be quests to rebuild the BoS. Even doing events fighting the scorch beasts as BoS soldiers. Remember when factions were factions and had faction clothing like FNV? Put on that BoS uniform and go to a FOB to take on some SB along with other BoS soldiers just like hunter/hunted. Listen to your pip boy for the event. Only BoS need apply.
---
The same can be said for the Enclave. Quests to fix Modus. Why not have a quest to talk to a Bradly-Hercules like Broken Steel. Instead of a silo nuke strike, launch an orbital strike. You like PvP (I don't), but you could have BoS vs. Enclave. You are a member and Modus would love it.
---
There is a lot of room for improvement, but the Mod community is locked out of this. That is what made me love FO3/FNV/FO4 and Skyrim. The mods and **FIXES** to the game. I have made a couple of mods myself, and fixed things that were broken in those games.
---
Bethesda has an opportunity to improve the game, and perhaps put it back on solid ground otherwise fans of the game will go back to the mod capable versions. I like the FNV project on FO4 engine.
---
Not like they actually work on those critical issues In a timely manner anyway.
---
Seconded.
---
Both ranged and melee damage numbers in pip-boy do not change as my heath gets lower with the mutation.
---
Yes it does. Thank you much.
---
My first (and only) 2 shot was a single star level 20 combat shotgun.  At level 105. I was very sad when I sold it to the vendor. 
---
this is interesting, there should be a statement from Bethesda itself but it would be so stupid considering the event was a long ago, a shame really :(
---
fairly sure all deep pocketed are plans
---
They just mean by the back doors with turrets pointed at windows/doors. Is pain in ass and steals legitimate kills. Anywhere else is pretty much fair game.
---
I don't need the help with the math.  You obviously do.  Your claim was that they are 500 caps like that doesn't matter.  It does matter.  I pointed out that 500 caps with 13 mutations isn't cheap. Your response is that serums are free. They aren't.  Most people charge for them.  Sure there might be one person who will make them for free.  Not everyone knows that and not everyone can use them to make the serums.  Time being a limited factor and all.
---
Further more materials aren't free. They take time to acquire.  Since you aren't good at handing sarcasm in stride, let me warn you ahead of time that this is sarcastic:. We all know the game is really fair about giving you the necessary components to craft.  It's not like you could kill ghouls for 30 minutes straight and not get a single high radiation fluid.
---
The fact is, it can be a pain in the ass to farm Violet flux and enough support materials to make 13 serums of various other varieties. Especially if the RNG decides that this particular farming run if going to result in zero if a required resource.  One run I ended up with over 80 hardened mass and enough high radiation fluids to make one stable flux.  Another run I to ended up with some fluids but not enough glowing mass. 
---
Also, reading a bit more, you can't fix Adrenal Reaction long term.  Logging out and back in removes the benefit again.  So back to the fact your answer of "it's not a big deal" is only valid if you ignore the facts.  Good going. 
---
&gt; God reading this back gave me ebola.
---
Oh, I hope so. We don't need someone too stupid to work longstanding online platforms that they're actually using to dictate how people can't use the very same platform while not having enough experience with the very game they're trying to dictate to know how to initially open a communication to another player.
---
The world needs fewer people like that.
---
I'm dealing with some new issues, specifically with my CAMP. I had my Camp built, moved it to a new location, and now when I'm trying to place it from the stored menu, it just won't work. I can get it to turn green like it is able to be placed, but when I try it gives me either the "selected item is floating" or "intersects with existing item" error. I have made no edits to my CAMP and used to be able to move it and place it without problems, until today. I'm on PS4. I've wasted hundreds of caps moving my camp to new locations to try and place it
---
Does it still replace your underarmor?
---
I have been saving my candy too. I will get another Mutant Slayer's rolling pin... that would be my luck.
---
I do enjoy a nice swim :)
---
Rank 3 Good With Salt
---
This is something that people that push for a melee nerf always neglect. Personally I'm a bloodied player, so I really need to make my shots count and it's slow going stealthing around everywhere, and I die in two hits. That's the trade off...
---
Melee on the other hand might be able to crush enemies fast, but they also get all the aggro and their armor gets chewed up like a dog toy. They're also essentially useless against the SBQ until it lands. And armor is way more expensive to fix than guns... Also after you hit a certain point ammo just isn't an issue anymore. On my main weapons I can't remember the last time I had less then 2000 rounds for them. 
---
Like I said in another post we cant even decide if it is soda or pop.
---
don't get me wrong its not something that I really care about in the long run. it just annoys me a bit when I think about, but then I remember most games are gameplay over story so it stops being annoying.
---
At least the brotherhood and super mutants got plausible reasons and were just dropped in without explanation.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I feel like Bethesda's priority right now is server stability and performance fixes. They've got to get both of those stable before they can start adding shit like factions. But I do see it happening down the line.
---
Ass holes. When you punch down like that your an ass hole.
---
People are just trying to sound impressive by quoting sneak attack numbers. The real attainable number is around 2500 with full Chem and food buff stacking
---
take off your mods
---
It totally wasn‚Äôt because you get no extra benefit if wear atom shop or just wear the costume you earn in game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Do you have that mutation where if you have a disease you give off a poisonous aura ? 
---
Last oatch (patch 5) Strange in Numbers caused the visual bug in the Effects tab, but all the mutations still worked. Now Strange in Numbers is actually causing the mutations to fail to provide all their bonuses.
---
its a bug with your mods. look around there is some line of code to pop in to fix it.

I also read somewhere that though Sony are 'open' to cross-play now, it can be a hard negotiation. Entities have to 'apply' to Sony for cross-play, they may reject it. An indie game developer detailed this on Twitter recently, after being repeatedly rejected. Seems less likely that a big company like Bethesda would have a similar issue though. But it is not just like, add a line in the code 'Goto PS4' for Bethesda to do, there could be other (non-technical) complications.
---
Bethesda doesn't owe the YouTube twats anything. So far they only officially addressed one rumor started by an emotionally unstable neckbeard, and the poor idiot has been having a meltdown about ever since.
---
I've never had the opportunity to own a TSE (as I was firm on my standing on earning one from killing legendaries). Even after the nerf of the TSE I've never gotten one. I love my All Rise, and I'm nowhere near 2k damage on it (I didn't fully spec into melee or really anything lol).
---
Maybe Bethesda should've looked at the way the perk cards would work in game? Maybe tried to balance out across the board? I don't know... But I'd still like a TSE just to say HELL YES I finally got one! üòÇ
---
It was just the item called "Straight Jacket" that you can wear. Everything was the same, just two separate entries. No condition or anything, just put into two places just like the Bowler Hat.
---
Did you forget to shower again?
---
Did you read the article in last week's article? It was article riffic
---
What was the Clothing they removed?
---
first of all, the melee sneak crit is 3 with ninja. and 2.5 with covert op.
---
second, in polarbear's video he's using an explosive weapon. it's stupid to compare it to a melee weapon to say the least, because explosions hit multiple limbs.
---
third, the damage he's doing in his video is actually comparable to cheeseburgercake's now that I look at it. so I don't see why you think the video is fake. is it really just because of the dislike bar?
---
and fourth, melee (and only melee) can easily hit for 5k per regular swing thanks to every little perk melee gets. unless you're trying to make a case that cheeseburgercake is photoshopping the damage in the tooltip, he's sitting at 3.5k BASE, that's without stuff like SiN and Revenant. on a poorly optimized build. you could easily push it past 4k, probably up to 5.
---
Yes
---
For the next week or two everybody has an increased chance to encounter the Mothman.
---
Might want to read the TOS again, or at all. Bethesda has the right to revoke access to your account at any time for any reason they decide to come up with, yes that includes having too much ammo. They could ban him because he has a funny nose the reason doesn't matter. 
---
Any online game you play has this same clause in the TOS, it is nothing new and not surprising. When you buy a game with online functionality you are doing nothing but purchasing a license to play on the games servers and that access can be taken away at any time, you agreed to that when you accepted the TOS and installed the game.
---
At the very least we should be giving Bethesda some credit that these bans are only temporary, cheating in other games gets you a permanent ban no questions asked.
---
That kind of paranoid delusion is not healthy man. You need to see someone to talk about it. 
---
I didn't say that it didn't apply to TSE users.  Go back and re-read what I said with that fact in mind.  Reread where I said that TSE needed to be brought down but not as much as they brought it down.
---
If an argument is made to bring melee down, if be against it because Bethesda is likely to screw that up too.  They don't understand a deft hand with changing weapon damage.  
---
My friend, there are entire wiki's dedicated to the practice of "mule accounts" and it's been going on for more than 20+ years of MMO.

It's not an exploit, it's people playing the game differently than you do.
---
No, until Feb. 25th, there's a higher chance that you have to see mothman. It says it right on the main menu of the game, before you hit "play", up in the top right corner of the screen
---
Odds are holiday ones will be holiday limited.
---
Mulling is not an exploit, and is not listed in the ToS as a violating in any MMO I've ever seen or played 
---
Why would you ever ever ever play with a controller over mouse and keyboard !?
---
Oh, didn't see that. Thanks. Now i feel dumb haha.
---
I like your name, but all the same, your post is lame.
---
I have a fantasy that they would do it, but the reality is that they can't get the bugs fixed without introducing more bugs. They are also interested in doing work on their new PvP mode which I could care less about. Some may find it interesting, but most folks I know would rather have a co-operative experience as promised.
---
**The #1 item for me is to make pacifist mode a real thing. I can't hurt you, and you can't hurt me.** No one shot killing me as a pacifist and taking my loot. That would save all the BS from griefers. Then they can do PvP on hunter/hunted.

Speed Enforced By Aircraft usually just means a helicopter with radar, but these guys sit by the side of the road in tiny jets like Wile E. Coyote... :D
---
Well I honestly would rather take down a sbq with players who worked as hard their gear as I did for mine. Playing with cheaters, even if only coop and at no fault of my own, makes it feel like my victories were hardly earned.

Give it more than a day, they are a company with processes and red tape, and most of the time it's taken atleast a week, and as long as 2 months (no, I'm serious) to resolve some bans.  
---
Not trying to be an apologist, just a realist.
---
What happened to the ‚Äúdatamined‚Äù lunch boxes that were being introduced?
---
Considering how the last few dupe methods has been executed, I‚Äôll take the instability during the actual duping itself as a myth. Before duping was made public it was, if not worse - at least as bad, but then people were blaming the carryweight. Then when that got patched is when people started blaming the duping. Then when most dupes were patched out, servers were still failing but people weren‚Äôt blaming any major glitch anymore. Truth is, only bethesda knows what the true cause is. 
---
But for good measure, let‚Äôs say duping does cause instability. Then the servers may or may not be somewhat laggy for a few minutes. A full dupe, as stated by several from the fo76bazaar sub, took approximately 2 minutes. 
---
The dupe methods double an item, so if you had a single one, you dupe that to over a million in exactly 20 dupes. 20 dupes x 2min = 40 min. So that‚Äôs 40 min of potential lag, assuming they‚Äôd settle for a million. Keyword, *potential*. 
---
I‚Äôm not going to say I defend duping necessarily, but I have almost 700 hours and I‚Äôve had maybe 10? 15? server disconnects. A lot of sessions has been 6+ hours. I realize I‚Äôm just one of many players, but I highly doubt that in my time I‚Äôve never been in the same game as an active duper. I think the whole server instability deal is far more complex than just simply caused by dupers. They may contribute, but I believe there are other core issues with it. 
---
Personally I have also never taken a workshop just to avoid PVP. I‚Äôve played with pacifist mode since day 1 aswell.
---
Only time I ever traded was with a friend, so I would have absolutely 0 impact on economy if I would have been duping. I can‚Äôt speak for others though, as we all know people sell their dupes here and there. Just saying, that I would be completely harmless even if I did anything like it.
---
Goulish goes a long way to doing that when radiation heals you.  Also Deathclaws are easy to stagger at higher character levels several ways using melee weapons.  Deathclaws are harder at lower character levels.  
---
Yea on ps4 with wife we went into the prison and were invisible.  When we exited to the yard we could see each other. That was the only time it happened in early January

He's been in meltdown mode ever since Bethesda official called out the rumor he started as bullshit. Dude needs to go to counseling and get off the internet.
---
You spelled your shop name wrong.
---
store in poland had a sale. oh no what ever will we do?
---
 I can be mistaken, but it seems that this was the idea of the boxes that the developers were going to give out to players for free for Christmas. Some event was planned. But the event was eventually canceled along with the gifts. But the toxic Internet turned everything up as if the developers were going to sell Lootboxes. 
---
He is pointing out that the game can now be bought for 5 dollars , Great game!
---
No need to remove your mods, it is just that their installation notes are now wrong, you need to add/replace some stuff in your custom ini:
---
Perk Loadout Mod is not working atm, the creator of it is working on it (but no need to remove it).
---
Why do you lie? The damage he does in the video with the deathclaw gauntlet is pitiful, you can barely see the queens health go down, in polarbears video he drops the queen in 2 hits, which matches his 40k dmg tooltip. The deathclaw gauntlet is clearly not 15k per swing so don't even try. If you are trying to say melee is op because of revenant you are lying again, revenant works for any weapon. If you think these 10k+ builds are possible, why don't you link me the full item list? You are simply relying on heresay and it's painfully obvious you live on the forums and not in the game. 
---
The silver bridge collapsed in december... There a plaque near the bridge and has a mothman connection

I've got likely the same number of hours on '76...  
---
Guess what?  
---
It was physical therapy for me as I recovered from 1st to 3rd degree burns covering both hands and up my arms.  
---
Playing '76 for hours upon hours at a time kept my hands from turning into masses of leathery scar tissue and was enough of a distraction I managed to avoid opiates except for the first week after the accident (addiction rate is insane with major injuries)..   
---
Know another '76'er with a chronic illness that basically leaves him chair bound, with a compromised immune system, so he literally can't go out.   
---
Short of long of judge, you have no clue what the other person has going on, and it does no good, in fact it can cause harm, when you carelessly try to shame someone.
---
Did that every time I saw someone‚Äôs turret farm right behind the back door. It‚Äôs also a good way to get rid of some excessive mini nuke.
---
Play another game, best decision at this point.
---
Looks like im off to find me my new bloodied ss +1 strength meat hook
---
Was it level 50 tho?
---
I think your junk should burn in the fissures. I mean, are you really going down there for it?
---
could. the sells is over and apparently even the news site he is reading from said it was likely a PR move by the store.
---
I agree. There are a number of posts on this topic already. I think that this was not completely thought out. The idea that you can shoot up someone's C.A.M.P and lure a creature in to finish it off (like a ghoul). Is just crappy. 
---
Anything not destroyed should auto-heal is a good idea if they are going to continue on this path.
---
I like the idea of turning on pacifist mode to prevent people from doing damage to each other and their camps is simpler. Less griefing.
---
450 hours, got 10k atoms just by playing. $ =/= atoms
---
- all fluxes are equally rare, violet is just traded st higher values since it's needed for a lot of things      
---
      
---
- you get multiple fluxes per queen, if you lucky even 3 or 4 violets ; in average you'll get may 1.x violet flux per queen        
---
       
---
- you can trade fluxes you don't need for violet flux (you could easily offer 2 fluxes for 1 violet) and junk you need          
---
- you get 200 caps per queen (3 queens a day are 18k caps a month) which is a lot to buy required junk      
---
- ultracite scaps you get enought from queen kills        
---
        
---
For 100k 5mm or .50 over 30 days 2-3 queens every day are enought. I know this in detail because I crafted over 150k .50 and didn't even traded much. I did like 5-6 queens a day in small group. I rarely had to buy junk from other players at all.            
---
Of course it sounds much, but it isn't over 30 days.       
---
14000 steel over 30 days is **less than 500 per day**. On a average day I probably got 1000-1500 steel. For gunpowder you need just some cloth (far from rare) &amp; acid (just scrap queen wings?.. some part of her) or simply farm super mutants (westtek). For lead I just regulary farmed 2  camps of friends with lead extractors.      
---
Overall this ~150k .50 ultracite were just like 2-3 hours of queen farming a day. The rest of my play time I spent at Westtek or trading.
---
To explain why I downvoted your comment before you assume all your downvotes are just angry fanboys:
---
I think you're missing the point. Where you paint the devs lazy, I appreciate them being efficient while still fleshing out a character a bit. I like that the effort was made without wasting dev time that could be better spent elsewhere.
---
Where you see something to ridicule, we see story and let our imaginations alight. I wonder who's getting more out of the experience.
---
As someone who used to do this you really misunderstand. I was a level 28 who couldn‚Äôt kill the ghouls and used it as an xp farm.
---
You lure all the ghouls out and tag them once each, then the turret gives full experience for the kill. I got from 28 to 50s in a week or two with this
---
No, he just rebuilt on the spot, don't think he knew about the moving trick.
---
Oh me too, but I've bought other things. I can buy atoms, so atoms have a price tag.
---
More people more lag. PVP undoable
---
I had that happen to me yesterday. I was so mad, but I think @SweetT33gs is right. If you fall in... good bye. 
---
It would have been nice to get back the 47 stacks of aluminum and 50 stacks of adhesive.
---
I would guess lights, wall decorations, or at a stretch roofs.
---
Overall good but several crashes to desktop on startup, and an hour in, my social menu went blank, and I couldn't fast travel to my friends anymore. I had to restart four or five times for the social menu to reappear. The stash space was really nice, and I was glad for the rad worms fix. 
---
I have had no problem with my instigating death tambo, but my instigating lever didn't seem to be working right.
---
the issue isnt the atom shop items, its an issue where the process of enabling mods disables atom shop stuff
---
I used to have a ghoul slayer camp and it was because I couldn‚Äôt even kill the ghouls at level 28, but it was a fantastic xp farm for me. I got to level 50 or so in a week or two from it. All you have to do is tag the ghouls and the turrets finish the job, I‚Äôve never understood the hate but was constantly griefed by powerhouse high level characters
---
I think they‚Äôre misunderstood 
---
Ok you do realise how weird it is that you know and i don‚Äôt 
---
And that I created it
---
The whole complaint is based on the idea that two people can not come to the same conclusion.  Which is BS.
---
They can and I have my own experience to prove it. As a kid I watched Dragon Ball Z a lot. I would do usual kid stuff and pretend to be a Z fighter and such.  Well not long after Dragon Ball Z budokai 2 or maybe 3 came out and kid Trunks had the same double buster move and motion. A move that was made for the game and doesn't appear in the anime.
---
Middle schooler me actually became a bit paranoid about it for a week after seeing it in game.
---
Does anyone else get a bug where the Targeting HUD outline will appear even without the mod at times? I have had it appear even when not in PA and haven't eaten a single Berry Mentats the entire time I've played the game. Is there some disease that causes it?
---
damn gatling gun is slower now
---
The statue is cool, just get that, the lilac PA paint is decidedly not MM.
---
I‚Äôll admit it it‚Äôs an autocorrect typo but it‚Äôs really weird how you know my shops name and I don‚Äôt
---
My marsupial jump during patch 5 after strange in numbers was equipped or shared was definitely affected negatively. Not sure about other mutations, as I didn‚Äôt test it throughly. I just assumed they were too since when I went to my effects tab in my pip boy it was across the board. My team and I had stopped using it all together to avoid the bug. 
---
I used to be able to solo her. Then they nerfed explosive guns to the point that the non legendary counterparts we're better. Everytime I've fought her since it didn't matter how many people came. They simply can't deal enough damage per player to the amount of health she scales per player. 
---
The queen needs nerfed 
---
Interesting. Perhaps blue for water and green for food? Then the red could stay as an alert.
---
Awesome. I bet some people can‚Äôt wait to drop $15 on digital paint that probably should have been included in the overpriced base game. 
---
How did you get in? 
---
lol haha
---
Always keep my camp open for anyone who needs to stop by and use it. I run by other people's campswho have a door and if pick the lock anyway just so that I could scrap some junk and fix my weapons. Than I close the door lock it again and leave. Probably never knew I was there.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not going to say I defend duping
---
Really? After all you've typed to paint it as harmless?
---
Sure it will probably get better but the question is weather or not it will ever be good. Nobody really knows the answer to that. I would recommend holding out a while longer but if you can get the game for $15 or less it might be worth buying. 
---
Ok, I might be really dumb here, but so far as I'm aware I'm not running any mods. I had thought about getting the "known plans" mod, but I never got around to it, and then Bethesda added that in a patch. I'm not using the Perk Loadout mod. After looking in my downloads, I don't see any mod zips in there, either. Nexus download history doesn't have anything in it, either.   
---
Is there a way to tell if I do have mods I'm not aware of?
---
&gt; you really misunderstand
---
Are you the guy with the multi-level turrets firing into the upper windows? Because there's no way you could have tagged even a tiny percentage of the ghouls that were killed that way.
---
No I‚Äôm not talking about a nerf. I‚Äôm saying she is bugged and becomes immune to damage during the fight. 
---
Just wait till you see what they broke now that they fixed a couple of things
---

---
Believe it or not it's actually pretty fun do start fresh and know what to look for, what to do, what to eat, what to pick up, where to look for stuff so yeah... it's actually better in a way!   
---
If I get my account back great! But I'm not gonna hold my breath on waiting that's for sure! Future patch or update could mean whenever! 
---
possible sure but not likely, not to mention that its not just a one off thing large amounts of people have to agree on the term or it holds no real meaning. Like how growing up all video game consoles were "nintendo" to my parents regardless of what they actually were. did I know what they ment? sure, but it wasnt what was used on the whole.
---
in the first place it wasnt an actual grip, more of a "you can nitpick anything if you try" example.
---
That may be. Or it may be that she had scaled to the point that you couldn't damage her. She gains a substantial health boost per player in the event. And she regenerates health if not enough damage is being dealt. 
---
It looks like it came back, but the stranger mutations perk card seems to reverse it. Also, joining a group sometimes makes it go away as well. 
---
&gt;Why do you lie? The damage he does in the video with the deathclaw gauntlet is pitiful, you can barely see the queens health go down, in polarbears video he drops the queen in 2 hits, which matches his 40k dmg tooltip.
---
mind explaining the second segment, then? the one where he's shooting at hear and dealing comparable damage to cheeseburgercake?
---
it's almost as if his video was just a mishmash of music, memes and duplicated bobbleheads with little information to go on. meanwhile, on cheeseburgercake's video, you can clearly see his stats throughout the fight. he's sitting at 3.5k base and 5k boosted by revenant.
---
you're literally arguing that he photoshopped, with great skill I might add, the tooltip damage.
---
&gt;If you are trying to say melee is op because of revenant
---
that's not what I'm saying at all.
---
&gt;If you think these 10k+ builds are possible, why don't you link me the full item list?
---
bloodied power fist, adrenal reaction, talons, twisted muscles, unyielding with +str, nerd rage, bloody mess, tenderizer, radicool, party boy/girl, strange in numbers, revenant just to name a few.
---
I have deep pockets for leather, but it was so long ago, I don't remember where I picked it up. So, it does exist.

More free things!!!
---
Watch out, the Fun Police are listening :)
---
Seriously, I've seen plenty of things people "like" getting nerfed to crap in these patches.  White Knight, relog fills Power Cores, etc.  If you have a tip, just keep it to yourself if you don't want it taken away....lol
---
You might think I'm kidding, I'm not :)
---
BTW that worked!! My Wolf stayed white!!  Thanks man.
---
well there is a possibility that nothing new to be mined has been added yet. afterall we havent gone through all the already mined skins.
---
There's no way to know if whatever event they we're planned for was cancelled or just hasn't happened yet. This is the problem with datamining, not only does it spoil future content but it's a breeding ground for speculation and rumors about said content. I try to avoid the shit out of it, but when browsing a thread about say one of the unopened Vaults somebody just has to casually drop a spoiler from the dataminers without prefacing there is a spoiler about to come. Or like the case with the launch boxes people will automatically assume something and start a crusade against the boogyman.
---
By the way, did anyone else straight crash to
---
Desktop the first time attempting to log
---
In, after the 2nd (the short one) loading screen ? Wondering if it's related. I have twisted and adrenal, herd mentality ,
---
And supial and speed demon. No empath, egg head, bird bones, or eagle eyes.

Checked all 3, im starting to feel like its bugged and you cant preview it

The u-mine its in the ash heap can give coal as a reward.

Not griefing, playing the way I want to. You don't have to like it but nothing will change that its a style of play that will never go away in these style of games. 
---
honestly, the beth ppl looking thru the feedback thread should know this already. me who didnt even buy the fireplace know about it because i browsed those feedback thread a couple of times...
---
Consoles are struggling to get that 30fps. No chance you'll ever get 60. Your best bet is getting a powerful PC
---
&gt;you see a few people with crazy builds and think everyone is running that? Nope.
---
Absolutely this. 
---
Most normal, average people are just playing with what they find in the game. Cavalier/Sentinel armor? I have over 250 hours in this game and have literally never seen anything with these names. Don't have mutations or exploiting bugs. I've sold every Bloodied anything I've ever gotten because I don't want to be near death while playing. Same with Unyielding. Ditto Radicool. Never complained about TSE's because I don't engage in PvP so I don't care what weapons other players have. 
---
I don't have as much ammo as they stated. Those are crazy numbers. I probably have like 100k various ultracite ammo. 
---
Lead is lucky hole mine. 
---
Steel is super mutants or ore around southern locations
---
Gunpowder is super mutants too 
---
Cloth is everywhere
---
Acid is everywhere. Just gotta know what to kill. 
---
Well I stopped playing the game but I had about 100K 5mm that I farmed legitimately, so I guess my account will be banned 
---
Ok, I might be really dumb here, but so far as I'm aware I'm not running any mods.

I never equipped strange in numbers or entered a party. I tried to log in once, crash to desktop after the short 2nd ghost loading screen immediately (when I can already hear the zone music has started). Logged in after starting it up again. My damage is wrong and adrenal reaction only has - hp. -37 bc of class freak 1

I'm getting tired of these whiners
---
So I did this exact thing. Removed adrenaline,  reapplied and it showed working. Damage of a bloodied handmade with nerd rage and adrenaline at 300 ..which is lower than pre patch. Logged out , logged in.. now its showing only thr negative effect BUT my handmade is up to 377 .. jesus. 
---
Did you own any workshop? If yes you are free game for them since patch 5
---
Devs tagged the ultracite ammo that doesn't drop. And the overall ammo is way past 100K
---
Tip:  Make sure you're not on any terrain that won't let the scorchbeast land.  They land more often in open fields with no trees / buildings.  I think there's something in their AI that checks "can you land here" every once in a while.  Flat open area = yes.  Trees, buildings, uneven terrain = mostly no.
---
It drives me nuts when we're doing a queen fight and 75% of the players are in the stupid fort.  I'm a melee main, so I get to sit there and get constantly spam attacked and flyover attacked without being able to do damage back.
---
On the flip side, when everyone empties out of the fort, the SBQ attacks don't hit everyone, so you do have time to heal as it switches from target to target.
---
Grab yer ballz and get out there boyz, they're not that hard to kill....lol

I keep myself at 20% hp with rads, and the 3.75x sneak modifier at night (2.5x during daylight) ensures most things die in 1-2 hits.  Lvl 65 scorchbeasts take 3-4 shots in the air in daylight.
---
Makes you wonder: where are all the people that believed only three developers were still working on the game by now?
---
Your missing the points.  They‚Äôre not gone.  The dupers are still in the worlds duping, have multiple accounts on multiple Xbox‚Äôs with a network of people to move items.  This ‚Äúsuspension‚Äù wave hasn‚Äôt even slowed them down.
---
I've always wanted to make a trip round the States, sadly funds have always been kind of an issue.  I've been trying to figure out a plan to go to places though, so I'm adding this to my eventual plans to hit up West Virginia.
---
That's a pretty fair point. Having all that knowledge on 76 probably makes that second playthrough pretty interesting lol.
---
I may have to try that out that sooner than what I previously said. Sounds pretty neat!
---
I‚Äôm not taking any sides. A lot of people instantly jump to this or that, but I don‚Äôt think the cause of instability is only due to duping. I believe plenty of people will still encounter connection issues after all dupe methods have been patched up. 
---
It could turn out duping is 99% responsible for instability, or it could be 5%. Bethesda are extremely vague when they mention it.
---
Like I said though. I know I‚Äôm just a single player, but I have a lot of time and a very small amount of issues with the game thus far. Chances are I‚Äôve been lucky.
---
Why are you accusing them of cheating for recommending a more laid back version of this subreddit?  Calm down mate.
---
If you bring anti armor like endangerol syringer and the aa perks for your gun. Tenderizer, adrenaline, glow sight the bar moves pretty fast. The stonewall is because more people show up and noone has any AA. It's like trying to take down a mutant with a rifle and not having tank killer. If only everyone had the right gear and perks. It's not a bug, just everyone in that group are clueless (imo).
---
How is it stupid? The people of Appalachia literally went through far worse lore wise than any of the lore in the surrounding wasteland. If you actually read the lore it is entirely viable and conceivable that no one survived. In fact to be honest the fact that you can leave the vault after a few decades to begin with is shocking.

No someone around you has either the HUD equipped or has eaten Berry Mentats.

He was injured and was house ridden.  He stated it alot around the post . Idk if he didn't in the revision. 
---
I have all those items and they don't push those numbers. I have the 3* bloody power fist with swing speed and +1str, I have the bloody grognaks with power attack and str, and I have the bloody super sledge with swing speed and reduced weight. The only way to get 5k hits is revenant and sneak attacks, and neither of those things are op. You should take a look at the people doing full automatic for 400 a shot before you even start trying to tell me how OP melee builds are. The numbers from the 15k melee video are blatantly false and you should have realized that by how little the queens health is actually dropping, despite that idiot saying "WOW LOOK AT THOSE CHUNKS" 
---
Halloween costume: turns 2 cloth &amp; 5 plastic into 50 caps per sale.

Yes but you can limit other things on the map to make it do-able. Like no none-hostile creatures on the map. No burn't magazines and all that crap. 
---
Are they like grenades? As in, if you have 1 in your inventory, then you have 1 use?
---
It's happened to me twice, before and after the latest patch.
---
Nope, we can't have any organizational nothing. We can't have perk card storing, or inventory tabs, or action bar / control ui customization. No one has made any acknowledgement the game needs any finishing in these areas. It's not on the known lists, at all. Therefore, I am a sadsupial

Still being salty as they reinstall the game just to log in, find one thing wrong, and then bitch and moan again.

The computer I bought a few months ago is now $500 less. As is life.

Okay, it seems that follow-up mail concerns the account that was banned before the suspension happened. So this guy had two accounts, one was banned a long time ago and bethesda confirmed perma ban with a follow-up mail recently. And another account is suspended due to carrying too much and he got the '100,000 within 30 days period' mail

**Yep, they totally went super nerf on Workshop Defense.....lol**
---
Want a workshop?  Want to get it super easy?  Now we have Easymode Raiding!  Don't bother breaking walls, or fighting the defenses, just step into a random abandoned corner of the workshop and BOOM CLAIM IT!
---
It really feels like they read a few reddit posts, see a possible problem, go CRAZY nerf on the solution, and don't even possibly look for problems it might create.
---
**TSE problem?**  Nerf it until everyone runs from it like the plague.  Bloody, Anti-Armor, and Furious Explosive are the meta now.  I'm waiting until they nerf that.  Maybe the new meta will be Junkies......roflmao
---
**Accidental Wanted Status?**  Let's make it so you can destroy 99% of EVERY object in the base and not get a 5 cap bounty.  RIP your base, and your materials.  Oh, by the way you can't repair partially damaged items.
---
**Do you like White Knight and the Gatling Gun Martial Artist Perk?**  NOPE, can't have any of that.  You ENJOY it, we NERF it.  Suck on that boyz.
---
**Workshops are fun and provide good benefits?**  First off let's nerf those benefits, f you for liking them.  Oh, that wasn't enough?  Watch this, let's make it so 100% of your defenses can be bypassed and you can stealth contest workshops from an abandoned corner of the build area.  How do you like your workshops NOW?
---
**There's someone, or some part of the Fallout 76 team that are hardcore Fun Police.  FUN NOT ALLOWED.**  
---
We will nerf anything you like until you don't like it anymore!
---
We get it, you are sick of posts complaining about adrenal reaction not working. Stop filling this sub with your complaining.
---
That's PUBG, not fallout

We all know Bethesda doesn't give two shits about the lore.

maybe you should revise your build.

well damn. 
---
I am getting tired of all these witch hunters, some players are legitimate and have been banned.
---
I don't think ppl realize how quick you can kill players with the right perks, even with modded non legendaries.
---
I used 250 rounds from a gatling plasma on a guy using it last night. A little broken.
---
That would've been a good drop 60 days ago.
---
\+25% damage now for Two Shot.
---
With +25% damage, that thing is a lead boat anchor.  Vendor it.
---
Very constructive 
---
Then obviously we can take the science route. Stepping anywhere in a radiation fallout zone even after 30 years will kill literally every person. Let alone, diseases. Your argument is still pretty void

Still having this issue here with very similar specs to OP, anyone else?

Popular topics on Reddits you visit make your Google news feed. I get all kinds of stuff from r/fo4 and r/fo76 in my news feed. 
---
I went hunting myself, couldn;t find it either. I found the poster bed and statue though.
---
I am kinda torn on these posts. There has been such incredible incompetence for so long, but because we like the game we so want to have these most recent victories to not be staled by a further manifestation of incompetence. Yet, it seems pretty clear that some of these posts are real. One of them was from a girl trying to make it on Twitter, I find it hard to believe that she is working overtime in the few hours she should be sleeping/working to exploit, then have her separate publicly presentable characters for streaming. So, Sophearia, assuming you are being genuine: that sucks, but perhaps it is a blessing in disguise, a motivation to move on to less shittier things.
---
I realize I'm a month late, but i tried shooting the interloper with the syringer and taking Buffout, but neither did anything. ( I was so hoping)  but there is an audible buzzing around the monster- so maybe it was telepathic. But maybe it died from the cultists poison drinks
---
If Bethesda would actually send me a ticket back regarding my account then you will all see. There are legitimate players being hurt by this as well. This community is just to full of trolls and witch hunters to speak out in.

I pop the vertibot smoke grenade and nothing really happens cuz ‚Äúit‚Äôs out of range‚Äù

I believe [these are the folks](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alpdyf/fallout_76_v_10510_changelog_based_on_game_data/?utm_source=reddit-android) you are looking for.
---
That was the changelog from the last patch, but there are links to the webpage they maintain. I didnt check how long it took them to release that post after the last patch, but it might take them a day or too. 
---
I don't care. Mods stated posts like these should stay in the thread that I mentioned. Notice how other 'innocent' dupers aren't posting? Well, they did post, it's just that mods deleted them all
---
its just the socratic method
---
Put your base on a coal node.  
---
The extractor needs like 15 power if I remember correctly.
---
It will gather up to 10 coal ore.  Smelt it with both Chemist and Super Duper for better quantities.
---
If you're making serums, 100 will last for about 33 crafts of scaly skin.
---
If you're making water filters, please stop....lol  Water filters are a complete waste.  Use the camp purified water generators.  Faster, more efficient, and require 0 materials after you build them.
---
Hope that helps!

So why were you linking that other video earlier showing 16k dmg? Admitting you were wrong finally?

The shmuck can't even maintain eye contact while he's talking.
---
My adrenal reaction isn‚Äôt working either. I‚Äôm not going by the Effects tab either, it does visually glitch sometimes. I‚Äôm going by weapon damage. Most people are having the same issue.
---
How is my argument void? You just made an argument based on game lore then ended it by saying hmm the fact that they can emerge after 25 years is kind of suspect...
---
I'd say that makes your argument void, compadre.
---
lol very helpful..im making scaly skin thnx for the info
---
Agreed, and kudos for acknowledging the effort. They certainly hear about it when they screw up; we ought to recognize progress like this too.
---
Adamantium skeleton makes this not work. I found that out the hard way last night.
---
if anything I'm pointing out you don't know what you're talking about. this guy hits for 12k sneak/4k regular on PA with an axe.
---
in case you don't know, that's worse than regular armor/unarmed.
---
Only if they‚Äôre high levels. When I was a low level I tried grouping up with higher levels so I could level up myself at whitesprings, but people were only there to run the whole area real quick then switch servers. No one would help. So I used turrets to damage ghouls to very low health and then I‚Äôd finish them off for the experience. I‚Äôm sure other low levels have to do the same if they want to level up there and no one will help them.
---
So if it‚Äôs a high level go ahead and wipe their base if you‚Äôre prepared to lose caps or face a 4 hour -50% damage to players penalty, but if it‚Äôs a low level then don‚Äôt be a dick. Ask them to move if you need too but you need to offer to help them as well.

Thats many games. Elder Scrolls Online did the same thing with their pvp cryodill. They got rid of all the Deer and wildlife to make it lag less (not that it helped). 
---
Yes but that would be exploiting. It‚Äôll end up getting changed again or something worse, like temp bans for exploiters.
---
Doesn't this make you Wanted? I always assume so, so never tried.
---
Have you ever considered that maybe Bethesda is also on the internet and has a looooong track record about lying about this specific game?
---
Not everyone that got suspended is guilty. 
---
No, I‚Äôm at the cart path by that cliff down the hill outside, or was. I had to lure them out physically and tag them along the way. I died a LOT in that area but it‚Äôs the only way I could kill them
---
Because it's completely viable that there aren't NPCs from a scientific perspective as well as a lore perspective. You obviously just aren't taking the time to read and listen to the actual story. Beyond that the whole premise for the game is the players rebuilding Appalachia. Sounds like you are in the wrong fallout game, compadre.
---
What I'm saying is don't start a new thread talking about your innocence. make a post on the above thread
---
Anyone?
---
That‚Äôs a bit pathetic.
---
As a melee main, yes, the damage you can crank out it obscene. I made a thread several weeks back talking about how the 2h weapons pretty much just shit on everything.  Unarmed is even worse, BUT you do need some serious investment and nice legendaries. 
---
The problem (aside from numbers that need tweaking) is the legendary system. I never liked the system in Fallout 4 and it is even more cancerous in 76.  
---
3 and NV worked COMPLETELY FINE without dumbass legendary effects like hyper swing speed, increased damage when health dropped, etc. There were a FEW unique items that had cool effects like this, but they weren‚Äôt staggeringly OP. 
---
If you used a super sledge or bumper sword, you knew you were getting a slow swinging, hard hitting weapon. Now you can get a super sledge that swings faster than a knife.  It completely shatters any sense of balance and ‚Äúunique‚Äù feels for weapons. 
---
The legendaries for ranged (aside from two shot and explosive) don‚Äôt really bug me as much, but those two are enough to throw the whole system out of wack. 
---
I‚Äôm not even saying you can‚Äôt have legendaries. And you don‚Äôt need to make them useless, but they should be SLIGHT variations. Instead of 50% armor penetration it should be 10%, etc. 
---
It is hard, I am torn on them too. Some of the items posted in the lists are actually quite feasible, easier again if you farm in teams. Bethesda was just a touch lazy on this one...
---
Thankyou for the kinder words though, perhaps it is. But I was still wronged for no reason and this makes me ever so frustrated...
---
Although I'm not playing until Perk Loadout manager gets updated! Can't play without it :(
---
Bit pathetic.
---
Sounds like you saw a 40 you thought you could bully and got your ass kicked. Get over it.
---
Nope they didnt
---
I have put a post in the thread above as well. You don't have to continue on in here if you do not wish. You never had to too begin with if you so chose not too?
---
Bet they cap number of players on a map too
---
You're correct.
---
Bethesda doesn't think of the implications of what they do, they just Shila Lebouf DO IT, DO IT NOW.
---
Good luck with the griefers now.  Smack all your things to 1 hp, then kite over a mole rat.  It'll do the rest easy....lol
---
Or just leave it as is.  Then you can do the annoying "repair all" multiple times a day every time a stiff breeze and a single enemy shows up....lol
---
Already noticed they haven't fixed things they said were fixed... for example supply drops. I did the supply drop request which was supposed to have been now for the player requesting it. I fight the robots... do the request and when I get there there's literally nothing in it...lol   
---
So thinks aren't perfect in Fallout...ha!
---
People are mad that people are using turrets to kill ghouls so other people don‚Äôt get the experience and loot, but if those people don‚Äôt use the turrets then the people complaining would just kill everything so no one else gets the loot and experience.
---
Gay
---
Hate getting chemed out when all I wanted was a bite to eat 
---
You seem earnest so Ill explain why Im not behind this.
---
OCD aside, having 1 HP walls doesnt affect you. We have yet to see if the griefersr will bother doing this as it has no real effect. The cost to repair almost everything in camps is so minimal that, aside from Decontamination Arches, I can't see how this is an issue, though time may prove otherwise.
---
On the other side of the issue, Ive never been wanted, ever, except for the multiple times a stray bullet nicked someone else's workshop structures. I join in on workshop defenses for strangers all the time, whenever one is conveniently near me. Sometimes people leave me alone for ten or twenty minutes while im Wanted, but eventually, and sometimes at terrible times, a go-getter shows up and baam. 
---
The potential for lost junk due to Wanted from mistakes is super common and a real pain for us timid folk. I can only back Bethesda on this decision. 
---
Convince me Im wrong :)
---
I'm am going off the damage number on my weapons when I say mine is still active. I logged on today and my bloodied combat rifle was at 80 damage it's been at 125 or so damage ever since I redid my adrenal and hasn't changed once. Well unless I loose more health. I don't run a complete bloodied build though I don't do that 20% health crap. I keep mine between 30 and 40% so I don't run nerd rage and all that. Plus I'm more melee build I logged on an my bloodied axe was 500 or so damage and now it's 800+. Not saying everyone will have the same results but my adrenal is working just fine even though it's not showing any positive effects
---
Bro the video is from 3 patches ago, look at the date. Melee is strong but not 10k+ dmg strong, you keep falling for those click bait videos though. Maybe you haven't noticed but you keep getting down voted when you post these idiotic numbers because they aren't real. as of right now, in February, the maximum without sneak attack or revenant for a fully stacked bloody melee is around 2.5k, not 10k or 15k like the video you linked
---
woah bethesda just cant stop fucking up
---
Ask Rafi. He makes the toilet kitchen work.
---
The repair cost is so negligible that Beth should seriously consider a slow heal over time for all CAMP structures, make it part of the lore as a function of the C.A.M.P. device. have an upvote.
---
Then why make a double post then? I don't get it 
---
Is there a way to decrypt the code manually without the command center in the bunker showing the keyword yet? I'm trying to decrypt the code pieces myself (for fun) and I don't see the keyword in the command center yet. I assume there is some way since the NukaCrypt site and others have the codes for this week. I'm just curious. 
---
People get grumpy because you‚Äôre ‚Äústealing‚Äù the kills in their eyes, since they don‚Äôt get to tag the ghouls and get the loot and experience. But if they can, they just one shot everything so other people don‚Äôt get the loot and experience. At least with turrets it takes a while for the ghouls to die.
---
I had to rely on trading to get any of my decent items except for one bloodied explosive SMG that I had to build my character around. I had to grind to get the caps or supplies to sell to other players to get those precious caps. Its disheartening that almost all of my personally acquired loot sucks and I end up dumping 95% of it into the icebox at the white springs because they are not worth their weight to haul to a vendor. While other players seem to get a god weapon every other day. I feel a rebalance of the legendary loot tables would do a lot of good for the endgame content. I've killed countless 3\* legendary mobs only to be rewarded with a 1\* wooden left leg or a flare gun or even nothing at all sometimes. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm confused. Your rifle damage went down (like everyone‚Äôs) but your axe damage doubled? Sounds like your Adrenal Reaction is bugged too bud.
---
Yeah it used to be 200v200v200, its now 100v100v100 since they added so much crap that was playing in the backround (buffs/debuffs hots/dots). 
---
Darn, I was hoping something would happen, all we can do is speculate now! Yeah and I have seen those drinks and some think that the cultist‚Äôs drank them and killed themselves as ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù
---
Unfortunately, the reduced weight effect doesn't apply to mods :/
---
Potato server struggles to handle an SBQ fight. Don't think more than 20 players on a single session is a good idea
---
I has turrets firing through windows and I tagged every single one of them. If the turrets can hit them, so can a player. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd think they couldn‚Äôt. All you have to do is click your mouse or a controller button. 
---
Gottem
---
Lol that sounds about right. It wouldn't be fallout 76 without that! For a better or worse. 
---
With that said I wonder if they will actually fix duping and furthermore unsuspended some accounts like the emails stated, but I suppose only time will tell. 
---
Being caught cheating/duping, resulting in a ban, then lying about it on here, is hardly a "legitimate" grievance.
---
Last I saw there is a legitimate official process for reporting bugs, glitches direct to the developers, who reply. I know I've tried it.
---
All your abusive language does, is reinforce my point and makes you look like you lack vocabulary skills or intelligence.
---
Last I looked, you do not own this forum, so I can post whatever I like.
---
You're too good at the game, they must be killing themselves.
---
&gt;Bro the video is from 3 patches ago, look at the date.
---
what does the date have to do with anything? afaik, melee hasn't been nerfed, ever. and they're not making use of bobbleheads either. so what's your point?
---
&gt;you keep falling for those click bait videos though.
---
**so you're saying these guy who can barely edit a video somehow changed the tooltip value?** that's what you're saying? because otherwise I don't see how these videos can be "fake" or "clickbait".
---
&gt;Maybe you haven't noticed but you keep getting down voted when you post these idiotic numbers
---
only two people here, "bro"
---
&gt;as of right now, in February, the maximum without sneak attack or revenant for a fully stacked bloody melee is around 2.5k
---
even if that was the case, my bloodied shotgun can barely scratch 900. so despite all this mess, my point still stands: melee is op.
---
I ust vault peasant with an intelligent of 1...but you convincing. 
---
Me keep this in head.
---
Most of the issues with Fallout 76 is because of dropped loot. The more people, the more dropped loot on the ground queuing up the server. Which is why it gets worse the more shit dies. They could easily disable all drops during events and make event rewards better. That way we save performance. 
---
Its possible 100%. 
---
What happens when you add a piercing receiver (can't remember the specific name) though? Or various AA perks? 
---
Melee with PowerFist and no PA üòê
---
you're forgetting ts is blind as a bat, though.
---
Well, if you do the same for the TS, it won't matter!
---
Yes, they should do that.
---
24 people will be super boring.
---
How could they achieve that number?  By dumping all the quests and random events.  They can leave the Atom things in there for the masochists (yes, people will hunt you while you atom challenge).
---
Also get rid of world loot spawns and make all loot container based (but put MORE loot in all the containers).
---
If the server isn't trying to track all the various PVE things and world spawn loot, that should free up resources to put more players in there.  How do I know that's true?  I've worked in the industry before.
---
Every player doing a quest is taking up processing power.  Event triggers, enemy triggers, condition triggers, it all eats into the server processing.  If you had 1,000 quests simultaneously being actively tracked on the server it would melt down.
---
Same thing with world spawns.  Constant "is loot ready to spawn here" checks.  Also constant LOD and line of sight checks.  If you had 250,000 open world spawns constantly being tracked, same thing, server melts down.
---
There are ways they could get more people in there.  But will they do it?  Probably not.  Their decision making so far has been pretty garbage.  Chasing dupers and endless bugs, re-introducing bugs and dupe methods, and producing 0 new content as everyone leaves the game due to boredom.  Games shouldn't go on massive sales in the first 3 months of opening, but Fallout 76 has......lol
---
*When hipfired!
---
Maybe. But hey, I ain't a game developer so what can I say :D
---
Mine got filled up with junk quickly. Because I‚Äôm a hoarder and need help. I pick up and scrap everything I come across that isn‚Äôt nailed down
---
I logged in today at 80 damage and now I'm at 125 damage it went up not down. I have no rifle perks on at all it shouldn't be very high
---
Waste more ammo dlc came out, it was a big hit.
---
The trouble is that TS is horribly inaccurate. If you could hit with both shots reliably then it is slightly better, but that's not going to be the case.
---
Probably does multiply with Explosive though, unlike AA.
---
A double post? I said i have put a post in there, not copied this to there. 
---
Each silo has is own loot, so if you loot one, you can still loot the others. They all have a weight room in the first area with 73 lead worth of weights. If you constantly farm them for the lead and then buy or scrap or use the steel factory for the steel you can make thousands of rounds easily.
---
Mine came all the way from the munitions factory to save my ass, where's yours based?
---
Check my 2nd edit, you might have not known that either!
---
This guy is the equivilant of a tabloid magazine. He has 'sources' that tell him stuff then makes up stories based mostly on conjecture. At this point I don't even think the community cares about them off loading copies for cheap, we all know the game has had issues since before its release and although I don't believe it will be free to play this year I wouldn't be suprised if it became one of the free ps plus games this year once its in a better state.
---
No problem :)
---
I had to do the same thing.  I kept googling "Fallout 76 coal location" "Fallout 76 coal farming", etc and was getting nowhere until I hit a post that said "ore extractor it".
---
Simply move the base for a couple of days, frequently return and collect the 10 ore, chemist and super duper it, and you'll be done farming for a good long while.
---
I've found that Scaly Skin is a mid-tier draw of a serum.  You'll get some people wanting it but not a ton.  Marsupial, Speed Demon, Healing Factor, and Adrenaline pretty much everyone wants.
---
Um, I don't know, actually.  No one's ever come after me. Soooo that's all I can say to the few times I've done it.  
---
I feel dirty now. 
---
If you look and hope for negatives, you will find negatives. 
---
As Jim Morrison said: People are Strange, when you're a Stranger
---
If people wanted to bash the game, they should have been focusing on the general instability of the server/client tunnel. That was the damning error by Bethesda, not bags or rum or 75 people's emails being mistakenly leaked. 
---
I get you want your voice to be heard. Just play by the rule next time. That's what got you banned in the first place right?
---
What if someone Negan‚Äôs a member of your family and then held a gun to your head, and the only way to save your own life and your families was to duplicate gear in fallout 76? Would it be acceptable then?
---
Not effected?  Moar crack pleas.     Wtf dude.  
---
Walking everywhere with all these bugs, griefers, and disconnects is a literal hell.
---
They broke a few things but overall it's one step in the right direction in one place one step back in a few others 
---
I watched that video closer and checked his perks, it's clearly fake and he's a total newbie and so are you. He's not even using food buffs and doesn't have all the right mutations and his perks are absolutely awful. I never said melee isn't op, I said it doesn't do 10k. My comment is still right there if you need to read it again 
---
yah i just wanted enough coal for me and my team mates really..because we had to lose all our mutations with the latest patch adrenal reaction failure..and ofc adrenal.was the last one to go with radaway lol
---
Wasn't true the last time I tested it, although I haven't bothered since the nerf. Both two-shot black powder rifles and pistols (yeah, I find some weird stuff) both had clearly visible spread.
---
so I just want to be absolutely sure about this: you're saying these guy who can barely edit a video somehow changed the tooltip value? that's what you're saying, precisely? I'm putting words in your mouth, you actually believe that?
---
I placed mine in on Saturday and it still says waiting for agent so I'm taking it as it's gonna be awhile... Mine was 100,000 rare in game items... I'm like How??? Seriously how? lol But all the ones I've seen are exactly a like so it should be interesting.   
---
Only one out of 10 people I know that play got hit besides me and their like what did you get that we didn't? They don't even know...
---
Those may have spread as well, then, because I know The Dragon does.
---
except no. all duped items were reduced to 1.
---
it is literally the reason and only explanation for them to be gone. 
---
nah man, when sighted as well.
---
My post was directed at a particular user who posts multiple long rants because he was banned yet won't say he wasn't cheating, or admit he was. If you want to take issue with that, that's your problem.
---
Which gun are using?
---
Adrenal Reaction is broke as of patch 6 too. There are lots of threads on that. That is a different issue.
---
I noticed TS weapons break hell lot faster
---
Thank you üôè
---
Hmm.. Well, I'm not going to argue with math!
---
64 is much better especially from Alta Vista/Staunton ( or wherever it branches off) all the way to Mechanicsburg- VA knows where it's money is, and 64 doesn't leave a lot of places for troopers to hide.  I went to VT as well for a brief while.  Blacksburg had some of the most incredible food
---
It shows up on the lights tab after you buy it. I did not see it either prior to buying it.
---
Sure.  I guess.  If you forget about PVP, then always.
---
Yes, I think that's true. Same with Explosive.
---
I'm dying laughing
---
Yeah I got the BoS Helmet mod from scrapping a leg
---
I'm saying the tool tip doesn't match the damage they are doing, idiot. I said that several times. 
---
back then I tried shotguns and heavy weapons. the minigun in particular was awful.
---
Strange in Numbers worked fine in patch 5. But if your teammate went to main menu while you had it on, you'd lose your marsupial jump (and other mutation effects) completely until they came back or you left team.
---
that's not how the game works.
---
I've come across people like yourself on XBone while playing and minding my own business of doing junk hunts or hitting hot spots of high level/challenging mobs.  Always trying to start something to initiate PvP.  Most times I ignore them drop a bag with raw fertilizer and go on my way (wish there was a way to light those on fire.)  If I see wanted status yeah I go check it out and see if the bounty is worth it, stealthed and watching the potential mark.  If it's worth it I'll go take the bounty with my melee build and go on about my ways.  It's usually someone with sentinel assassins gear that I 1 shot because they are moving and don't see me until it's too late.  It's fun making them salty.
---
Don't be surprised adds listen to you with you're smart phone and refine results.
---
It's cool, none of that even happened. Just using an example someone showed me on the possibilities of a flawed system. 
---
Yes, that's true.
---
Quick little jabs like that is why i avoided the other one in the first place actually
---
Ok, well that‚Äôs not how you originally explained it. Still though, nothing was buffed today so I don‚Äôt see how your damage went up.
---
Assuming your playing it straight I am sorry, and honestly waiting for it to happen to me.  
---
It is very "easy" to hit the numbers Bethesda appears to consider the threshold if it was your goal.  
---
No matter how many times I try to explain "multiple accounts" "Power Leveling" or "muling" people can't (or refuse to) grasp the concept.   
---
The more experience MMO players who entered this game just completely wrecked the curve and the average player has trouble grasping anything that deviates from the common Fallout playstyle.
---
It just works. - Todd Howard

It was 3GBs worth (at least on console). There must be *something* new

Yeah, shotguns will always have spread. The minigun was probably due to recoil, you sure?
---
Consoles are fps capped I believe, so no. Running lower res would help maintain the cap.
---
don‚Äôt forget the vertibot at the ammunition‚Äôs workshop
---
Very well said
---
Yeah actually, I always had solid a solid 60-65 FPS with V-sync off but after the patch I'm pushing 90s-100s even in big towns and fighting, no idea what the heck they did but it's amazing!
---
Also loading screens are much faster.
---
Consoles are always larger because they cannot just swap out little bits of code like pcs can. they have to swap out whole chunks.
---
and with bug fixes and stash increases there was a lot of code to change.
---
yes, very funny, but not an argument.
---
Picking a player's lock does make you wanted, but I guess this guy would rather deal with that hassle than having to carry all his junk around
---
It is quite easy, but as you say people don't understand or will not try to understand how some people can manage what they do. People also need to realize that this game was hardly balanced for these sort of things either.
---
Is that where my missing CHA is? 
---
When I load her up tomorrow, Ill take an addictol and see if I get my third CHA back, will report back if it does NOT work. Assuming it does, thanks!
---
In nearly 550 hours I encountered Mothman 3 times (not counting wise Mothman). After last update 5 times. 
---
lol under rated comment over here
---
"Sounds like you are in the wrong fallout game, compadre."
---
No, most players would agree with my sentiments. People that are satisfied at the state of FO76 are the minority, compadre.
---
The more people that join the event the harder she gets. You most likely had a bunch of free loaders who joined took two shots then proceeded to farm the mobs that spawned for exp and let every one else waste ammo on the queen I get those players all the time just there for free loot and exp not actually trying to kill the queen
---
you probably tested it far more extensively than I have it seems, so I'll just take your word for it.
---
the only thing I'm sure about are shotguns, but you seem to have that covered as well.
---
I'm honestly surprised to see people who've gone beyond level 100. I'm not quite level 60 yet and I've already lost interest. The game feels so empty and it's hard to even go out and loot because of the constant inventory management. Not to mention the numerous amount of bugs still plaguing the game.
---
I would love for there to be new content, but the current game still has so many issues. You've got bugs galore and so many balancing issues. I understand they are trying to fix the game, but what a mess they've created in the first place.
---
Some of us are getting burned out (bug report guy)...  
---
Plus it just hit today, takes some time ;)
---
Yeah, shotguns come to personal preference.
---
The point here is that you are a salty shotgun user spreading lies about melee weapons you don't even have (:
---
Where's your spot? If you're in a popular location you might just want to move elsewhere.
---
She scale with how many players are in the area, so I would image people in the 8 man wern't pulling their wait.
---
This became newly-relevant with today's daily challenge. Happily this was the first result on a google search on the topic, so let me thank you from the far future, relative to your posting this answer! 
---
&gt; That's an issue with one of your mods. Add these to your Fallout76custom.ini, right after sResourceArchive2list=
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; " SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2"
---
&gt; I had the same issue.
---
Fantastic!  It worked!  Thank you so much!!!
---
it's not a lie that they're op and it's not a lie that they can hit for roughly 5k per regular swing.
---
you're just making accusations and name-calling without proving how their tooltip is somehow wrong.
---
Cause adrenal is actually working it's just not saying it is. An yeah I'm terrible with words. But all in all adrenal is working for me or I wouldn't have the damage I do its close if not the same as I remember from the last time I played like a week ago. 
---
From what I understood of Two-Shot in Fallout 4, the base damage was increased and then split evenly between the two projectiles. Meaning that both are lower damage, but hitting with both is still equivalent to hitting the enemy twice. Like how the displayed damage for shotguns isn't the damage per individual pellet.
---
Is that no longer how it works in 76?
---
It does sound to me like you've been lucky, but we've had this conversation before (which is why I didn't launch into a full-on response) and TLDR I do acknowledge having no idea how disruptive duping actually is to stability and performance.
---
Given how noticeably scrapping and crafting can cause lag for the player doing a lot at a time, I think it stands to reason that duping could present a significant load. But I've never been of the opinion that duping is THE (as in the only) cause of all instability/lag. Just that it's reasonable to think it may be a factor.
---
At the end of the day, I stand by my assertion that duping on the whole affects the experience of other players in many ways, and is unfair and wrong. I don't think this should be a controversial stance.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you have a custom ini file. Things have changed with this patch and you now need to recreate that file by wiping it and copying and pasting all of the contents of your main ini file into it and then making the changes you require. This will work.
---
Only if you can‚Äôt read
---
You have a shedule on which year you want to tell us about the changes to the dmg-formula ?  
---
Can't see any information published to this ! (AGAIN !)
---
Regards ? ....

---
Were you the guy in the clown suit? Lol. I'm not actually kidding. Two story platform with missile turrets?
---
Any who. There's actually an easier way of doing that without setting up shop behind the clubhouse. The landscape to the south where you can look into the windows. Just aggro one, the rest come running and can't get at you. Best part? Unless they run off for whatever reason, they won't get hit by missiles. Fish in a barrel.
---
Though I was extremely excited tonight when I logged in and found I was the only one there in WS. Would have stayed too...if not for the damn lv 91 glowing deathclaw...
---
You commented earlier that if you aren't hitting for 10k your build must be wrong. Don't backtrack now sweetie
---
I did test a non-TS Dragon as well. Spread was quite a lot smaller than the two-shot weapons.
---
I can't rule out that the BP weapons are weird though. Didn't find many other TS weapons to test. I think I still have a Gatling on someone else's alt.
---
I wonder why these comments got downvoted. 
---
Aah that makes sense, yeah they weren't doing much.  I thought it was the update but you're probably right.
---
Wait, you just played for the first time in a week today? And applied Adrenal Reaction today? If so, we know why you aren‚Äôt effected. You had to have Adrenal Reaction before the patch came out for it to bug out. Bethesda reps are even saying we can wipe our mutations and reapply Adrenal Reaction to fix the issue now without waiting for a patch. 
---
The weapon will do 125% when both hit, and 62.5% when one hits.
---
Yes. It shows but when you test it with damage, you will realize it didn‚Äôt really add any DR. That‚Äôs why most people didn‚Äôt know. 
---
Same thing was happening in WhiteSprings today, high level glowing ones dropped level 35 gear...  
---
Might be a stealth Nerf?
---
Exactly. About 8 seconds after you throw it: Big boom. Enjoy :)
---
Because peons working at a call center dont know that your HBO didnt get activated properly. They can activate it if you ask.
---
They probably didn't know it also takes away mutations, so they got pissed.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** llREDACTEDll! ^(hug)
---
Make marine tactical helmets. They are cheap to craft and I get 29 caps each at vendors.
---
Yes, I'm almost 100% it's just BP, because I've only ever had a Dragon for TS BP, but many other TS, and they both hit 100% of the time ADS.
---
Wait bethesda said the fix was to remove it and grt it again?? Lolsss... this is ridiculous....
---
Quick question from someone about to buy the game: can I avoid stuff like this other guy was doing if I want to? It sounds really frustrating...
---
I'm glade someones finally calling Bethesda out.
---
Eh, all the worst offenders, speed, AP, etc are available for ranged if they are available for melee. So that's not what's causing the imbalance.
---
But you're right, there needs to be a bit more.. incrementation. The fact that a 1star can do 40% more then a 0star is a rather extreme jump.
---
We need a higher star cap with smaller effects for each star imo.  
---
No I've had adrenal for like 2 months. I got sick of all the last bugs with the mutations and diseases so I quit playing for awhile waiting for the patch. Plus I got sick of the drops however all they changed was the Queens loot pool which is stupid all the loot pools are trash at the end of the day I haven't got 1 weapon or 1 piece of armor I would use for a build in 213 levels 
---
Fun vid and chat, why was I the only like on Youtube if the commenters in this thread are all supportive? Go back to his channel and donate some likes, it is how these guys survive on Youtube :)
---
Well where else would you expect it to Be?
---
Is TS still stronger when combining AA with Tank Killer and Stinging magazines? You can get up to 93% instead of 50.
---
But doesn't that mean that the damage reduction from armor is calculated individually for both the 62.5% shots? The way damage reduction works against lower damage values, shouldn't that add up to less damage than a single 125% shot?
---
Wow the hate is strong, your response was -1 before I could even read it.  
---
No, you are correct, the game was balanced for a
---
More casual player, should be aimed for a more central balance point, and hopefully it will get there.
---
I went rafting under that bridge with my grandma who was !74! at the time. It's a stunning place!
---
\^ This. Sure, melee damage is crazy high compared to most ranged weapons, but it should be a fair trade-off to go toe-to-toe with a deathclaw. Recently, I keep playing as a melee character with a friend who plays a stealth sniper. We're both past lvl 50 by now and we do decent damage; I may do a little bit more but he gets to attack from relative safety. And while I'm quite tanky, I still get mauled from time to time if I get staggered (curse you, yao-guais!)
---
And yes, I can confirm that ammo is less of a problem later on, since my main is a stealth sniper himself. He got 3 rifles, each with different ammo for a different purpose (hunting rifle/handmade for regular stuff, gauss for sniping strong enemies and tesla for groups) and it works out nicely... until he gets swarmed by a horde of ghouls. Long story short: Don't underestimate the opportunity to avoid taking heat with a ranged playstyle. 
---
But would it give the alert if it‚Äôs not a PvP action unless you destroy it?
---
&gt; Play it like a single player game and you will be happy IMO.
---
Please excuse my ignorance, but won't other people just murder you? I love the Fallout series but I've never played a multiplayer game in my life, I just assumed other folk wouldn't leave me alone...? 
---
Agreed. I was rather disappointed at that fact. I had gotten my char to look exactly like I wanted, spent quite a bit of time doing it too...though it helps I play the same character in literally every game with a character creation system. I was thinking by naming her, Katherine (same name I use for every Bethesda game and the above CC system games), then it'd show up...
---
Simple test with ts rifles, hip fire you‚Äôll see two holes aimed one hole 
---
You have 0 grounds to make a claim like that. Suspicions at best.  I get you are tired of this but its recent and it's relevant as hell to those effected. This post was pry made to spread the word there may be more to it than duplicating items. You stabbing at the OP only makes it that much more important to speak out on the subject then, yea? You gave the thread in case OP didn't know,  now let it go ya ragey teen. 
---
Bethesda must change this. It's such a slap in the face. Maybe they intended to reward the mask and messed up.
---
SBQ flew more often during my battle, especialliy during the last 15 min. Didnt win and and my gunner go DC twice.
---
Idk if it make a difference. All I did was drop starched genes and jump in a rad shower. I lost healing factor 1st and then adrenal so I stopped. I put starched back on and went on got some rads and adrenal has worked fine ever since. But again on my mutation list it only shows negative but it's obviously working my damage numbers prove it's working. I've seen post with people using rad-x and whatnot I didn't do that just a rad shower. I also didn't log offer before taking the serums like I've seen people do in some posts. 
---
I‚Äôm not here to argue about which is a worse offender, ranged or melee, but I do agree we need a higher star cap with smaller increments of improvement. 
---
But the improvements should be the same weapon through and through. Take a super sledge for an easy example. You have a base level 50 with zero stars. 1 Star super sledge at 50 would do a bit more damage and weigh a bit less, maybe swing a hair faster. This would progress as each star was tacked on. 
---
So the difference between a 5 Star and a zero star would be significant, but there wouldn‚Äôt be random magical effects slapped in.  Super sledge would still be a super sledge, through and through. 
---
Also, it apparently had something to do with Radworms as the rep was asking about it. If you didn‚Äôt have worms you may have been unaffected for that reason, but adrenal reaction for most people is broke for whatever reason. It isn‚Äôt just a visual glitch, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.
---
Well no, but if you do the same for TS, TS is still better.
---
Haha I can relate. Thanks!
---
When both projectiles hit (so any hit while ADS), it's considered a plain 125% hit.
---
Omg. So you reset you adrenal reaction today? That fixes it supposedly. Now I feel like your a troll dude. üòÇ
---
Adrenal reaction = bullshit.   Why would you even use it. Waste of time. Stick to marsupial, speed demon, bird bones, etc......lol
---
Game's bad. Bethesda would go pay to win if they thought they could without backlash. Get over it.
---
Ok thats good to know. I wanted a AAE handmade and got an offer for a TSE for 1200 caps so i took it. Still have tank killer and Stinging so i get 43% armor penetration plus TS effect. 
---
if the player shill and accept this, they will slowly put out more, don't think they love you, they love your money, they are TESTING THE WATER.
---
If you consider 4 people in your party having all those outfits, the bonus is quite nothing, but if players accept this, then you can have my words those lunch boxes are coming out
---
Yup, you can try it yourself with the equation too, if you'd like. You got an amazing deal!
---
That the server didn't immediately crash is incredible
---
Yes I reset it today the issue started today. When was I supposed to reset it? Well its tomorrow now but I probably started playing at 8pm cst after the patch this morning. So how am I trolling? 
---
I would not be happy if that had been my experience, which had actually been my experience in earlier fights. I hope you and everyone has an experience like mine tonight from here on out.
---
Am I trippin? I'm looking at the game right now it it tells me what armor I'm wearing under my power armor with bullet points. 
---
Maybe I just misunderstood you then. I thought you meant you hadn‚Äôt played in a minute logged on and your mutation was just fine. No problems. I misunderstood you after reading back. Sorry bro!
---
Iirc she had an accordion in her room as well, so she was musically talented. I assume this because why would you continue with the accordion if you weren‚Äôt any good at it.
---
What if you aren't running mods, and don't have a custom ini, but still don't have Atom shop things showing up?
---
What the fucks YTA?
---
Yeah, he tries giving facts, but the truth us, we don't honestly know the full criteria for bans. The 100k ammo thing is pure speculation as we've seen just ONE post so far that's given any insight into how the bans were handed out.
---
The simple truth is, the vast majority of the player base won't hit 100k of anything in a month, including ammo. I'd like to believe that the ones that do raise flags get looked at by Bethesda before being suspended instead of just being auto-banned, but we don't really have any info either way.
---
So I'm not going to condemn Bethesda for banning innocent players or say that all bans were justified because we just don't know and we won't know until Bethesda releases more info on the ban process.
---
For a Melee, AP and Stimpaks are your ammo.  
---
Yes, everyone uses Stims, but a Melee is up front taking real damage directly from every enemy, no hiding behind wall, trees, etc. so they need more.  I probably spend as much time farming Stimpaks (plus Pharma Farmer) and the resources to make Stimpaks as most do for farming lead.  Yes, you can be a stealthy Melee, but that goes out the door during Nuke events, where you end up being front and center.
---
As for weapons being unbreakable, that's what equipping 5x Gunsmith and using 3x Weapon Artisan (repair 200%) are for.  The only reason my Melee weapons lasts as long as they do is because I equip the 5x Makeshift Warrior perk.  Given some of the complaints about weapons breaking, I'm assuming that some just don't use these perks to their potential.
---
Thanks for the enlightenment. 
---
It's all good. Nah I see people saying that adrenal isn't working even after they loose it and retake a serums. All I'm saying is I got rid of my adrenal mutation and used another adrenal serum right after and now my adrenal works just fine even though it don't show positive effects just negative. No clue why mine works and other people's don't. Or they just not paying attention to numbers and going by the mutation list. 
---
grind like the rest of us
---
I am not sure if you will see this but I really appreciated these threads when you posted them. I was wondering if any new items had been added since the last time you posted this thread. Thanks! 
---
Oof
---
Well the issue is surely melee weapons with optimised build can do 2k damage. They can only do its damage to a single target in close range. 
---
Pre nerf TSE weapons deal way to much AOE damage from far away. When farming WS ghouls melee player get swamped and  has to use stimpack even they can one hit kill every single target.
---
Meanwhile TSE users can just jump and shot the ground without much aiming and kill a group in one shot. Not to mention it‚Äôs damn cheap to craft ammo especially for TSE shotgun and handmade.
---
You can still kill a group of ghouls in one shot with mini nuke instead TSE and I‚Äôm sure no one will complain mini nuke being too op.
---
That's odd, because I tested it today with a level 5 character and he was pretty tanky. I don't doubt your testing either though, something is very off with mutations.
---
they can't break their promise outright, so they break it slowly, pretty sure there's gonna more like this 
---
&gt; melee or TSE before the nerf.
---
Those two things are very different in power. Yes, melee is very very strong. Just over borderline too strong. TSE was incredibly OP and radically too strong. I watched a group of TSE burn SBQ from full to dead in less than 1 minute. I bet money that a group of the same sized hardest hitting melee couldn't do it in 5 even if she was grounded 100% of the time.
---
Say what you will. There's a saying 'fool me once shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me'. We been fooled 300 times so far and people just keep believing. well shame on you. That's the reason why someone like 900 hours guy is getting 11k upvotes. 
---
Very well, but you should know that YTA.
---
Hmm. Honesty I like the random legendary effects.. But it would be more interesting if each weapon had its own list of possibilities. There could be aome overlap, but they should tailor each list to suit the weapon its for. 
---
Basically what they did with mods. 
---
Have they taken away our stimpacks now also??
---
Still don't have the canvas bag I bought three months ago.
---
&gt; Ranged needs a serious buff.
---
This all day. For ranged to be any good, you need a magic combination of shit, while melee gets to just be solid from the get go and can be amazing with proper tuning and RNG.
---
You are 100% correct! It‚Äôs part of the bug apparently.
---
pretty sure I said they hit for 5k. 15k with sneak.
---
like in the video.
---
YTA= You're the asshole
---
It was never about power levels, it was about enemies being a bullet sponges, and they made them bullet sponges just because AI is stupid AF and they don't have any other way to make combat harder.
---
Yeah i got really lucky. Ive seen people selling tse handmade for like 20k caps.
---
I‚Äôm completely confused !! but hear me out, my level 15  1 Star anti armor hand made kills a level 60 something whitesprings ghoul in 6-8 hits with the rifleman perk at rank 1 per category (reg, exp, mast) . My 1000 caps paid two shot 3 star lmg (ts,50%crit,90% reduced weight )  no weapon specific perks at moment cant kill one ghoul with 40+ bullets or take down a SB full blast point blank and down on the ground !!  WTF!!?? I can melee kill a SB in 5-8 full power wacks or about 30-50 rds with my AA Handmade !!! I wanna love 2-shot but it ain‚Äôt no overseers guardian ( my only go to weapon in FO4)!!!!!! I had the same problem with my 2 shot .50 cal it was a turd. 
---
You know what there isn't? Reports of people who craft at this level and are not banned. 
---
Blaming eachother is pointless, the problem is that the game is super limited in places to farm legendaries or grind exp. Outside of Whitespring there isn't any really solid spot to grind especially now that they nerfed Monster Mash.
---
I actually know only one in Poseidon power plant. And well, since then I didn‚Äôt meet any other vertibot pad to repair so I am confused about mechanics of this feature.
---
&gt; it maxes out at 250 for me
---
Then you're doing it wrong. I can get non legendary sledges to over 600 and that doesn't really require some crazy glass cannon shit. Unyielding armor, adrenal reaction, perks that increase str (radicool and etc.), chems and food buffs(glowing meat specifically). Once you get a couple multipliers stacked your damage really gets out of control.
---
If a lot of them got banned, a lot of them cheated or associated with cheaters. There may be some false positives but I think everyone is jumping on the ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù train.
---
Username checks out.
---
so what about the multiple TSE of the same guns? lol
---
I‚Äôm heavily against extreme leftism. I think it‚Äôs a terrible thing. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt advocating it. That‚Äôs a reel that‚Äôs gotten triggered and is only running in your head. 
---
You probably don‚Äôt treat your mother or children like using asshole behavior. 
---
I was having this crazy notion that we shouldn‚Äôt treat anyone else like assholes either. I say we because I‚Äôm human too and I do it too. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt imply the people we shouldn‚Äôt be treating like assholes have thin skin. It doesn‚Äôt mean their brain will explode if they you use the wrong word to address then. 
---
On average, they have normal human skin. Like you or me. They‚Äôre not crying with Britney.
---
And with human skin, when you spend a few years of your life working on a project you care about, whether it‚Äôs a mars rover, a construction project or a video game, you too, the left loathing man of thick skin, will have an emotional connection to your work. 
---
And when people come, consume it, and then spit on it and insult you, you won‚Äôt cry or scream, you‚Äôll say fuck them and go home at the end of the day. But it‚Äôll feel like absolute shit. And you, my non leftie thick skinned friend, are just as capable of it. 
---
And that brings me to my point. This isn‚Äôt about your left reel. 
---
This is just saying we should asshole less. That‚Äôs all. 
---
And when we do treat each other like assholes, be prepared to get asshole behavior called toxic. Because, well, it is. 
---
Buy a pc and plug into hdtv then you get 60fps smooth. If you want to game with your ps4 controller just plug it in
---
Idiot's gonna idiot I guess .
---
It amazes me that I'm still learning new stuff about FO76 just from reading posts like this, thanks!
---
When I'm sad a cookie usually makes me feel better. You should try it. Have a cookie.
---
Who the fuck uses that acronym. Either way, I've got orbital strike beacon just for WS turret camps.
---
i think op isnt telling the whole story, banned for a reason
---
That's because you combined more armor piercing with the Handmade, *and* LMGs do way less damage than a Handmade, especially with a good receiver on the Handmade.
---
If you were to use a TS Handmade instead, it'd be better than that AA Handmade.
---
No the turret camps are still the arsehole.
---
I had around 20 something, none in stash or inv after the patch.
---
Nice. I never thought about Tenderizer being useful. I glanced at it and thought it was for melee and teams only, but I guess it applies to guns and your own rapid attacks as well? Which a lever action is great for.
---
I do not have a custom ini. I have never installed Fallout 76 mods.
---
Cause they are not banned and don't have to bother making a post telling us about it
---
Well in this logic- weapon as well
---
I wouldn't have expected that. Interesting. 
---
Here's an edge case, while I'm pushing the issue: you think it's a hitscan thing, where the game recognizes both hitscans at once and just adds them up? In which case, what about non-hitscan weapons like the Plasma gun or Crossbow? 
---
So what do you think I should I pay for a standard two shot handmade ?
---
That makes no sense. It would easily put this to rest. And I argue it's because they are all banned. 
---
Also just looked at your posts, you seem like quite the arsehole IRL so nice hypocrisy.
---
Again, we don't KNOW that. The only info we have is from 900 hours guy post saying 100k rare items in 30 days (and that was more focused on his 150k ultracite plus another 500k ammo on a mule).
---
Until Bethesda releases a statement saying that 100k of any kind of item or ammo gets you banned automatically, you're just making suppositions.
---
I think it's because with normally one-projecticle weapons, ADS will cause it to still be treated as a single bullet. But who knows?
---
This is comparing apples to oranges. The guns need to be the same to make a fair comparison ie  Ts handmade and AA handmade. Also heavy weapons are lacking right now and the LMG is just down right terrible that‚Äôs why it can‚Äôt kill any thing. 
---
...what
---
No, yta if you turret the place. When I spawn there to kill shit I expect a chance to kill things. Not have 60% of the mobs killed by someone who can't be bothered to go in there. New players don't need to farm xp or legendary. They need to play the game. The mobs won't leave anything of level for you. So its a shitty move on there part. YTA for messing over peoples play experience with it. 
---
You got that right !!! I literally threw away a 1000 caps today I feel like a moron !!
---
I'm a heavy weapons user and I can guarantee you I've fired away more than 100k 50cals and 5mms combined so far but I don't feel like bragging about it. 
---
I'm playing with those guys about 2 month right now. 
---
People that play so often together that start to visit each other irl, i'm willingly to trust their words more than a random folks i could found somewhere irl on in game. 
---
Why don't you just turn raw materials into counters instead of having them as items? Like, y'know, Blizzard made it in Diablo III years ago? 
---
And yet they don't. Melee is doing 2.5k base, 5k is only with revenant. You said your shotty does 900. Let me guess, that's not including revenant or sneak attacks but when you measure melee you want to include those buffs so you can call them OP. You are a joke (:
---
The same price until they possibly raise after this post, who know? üòÇ I wouldn't do more than 3k for a TSE anything at the moment.
---
Never attempted to destroyed turret camps because of my laziness to switch out of passive mode but lower level players need to understand have an excessive amount of turrets will just piss everyone off.  Best way to not piss people off would be to have maybe 2-3 turrets to draw mobs and then toss molotov cocktails and let higher level players mow down the mob.
---
Yup. Everyone‚Äôs dead, so why are you bothering? Like the missions in the Mire running from bunker to bunker, all because a holotape told you to?! 
---
I had a hard time understanding WHY I would want to run around on missions for robots hat are completely content with just floating around for a millennia. After all, Codsworth did.
---
Why would anyone downvote this? Has this sub really gone such deep shit that anyone pointing out a good suggestion is being downvoted because he/she slightly criticizes the shit show that is Bethesda? nIce.
---
Multiple speed bonuses from what? SD doesn‚Äôt stack with anything else (except strange in numbers). It cancels all the rest. 
---
I learned that the hard way. Soloed a silo and launch and nuked a normal fissure site. I expected at least a super powered Scorched Beast but there was sweet fuck all.
---
Pretty sure everyone on that server was pretty salty for a bit...
---
So I got the custom ini from my brother who was running mods, added the line, and now everything works. 
---
Shhhh. Most of the perks are all useless. ü§´
---
You might be the smartest guy on the sub, but as soon as you or anyone tries to sum up what the other side thinks and uses hyperbole and the most exaggerated other position, most of us turn you right off.
---
There is a fucking ocean between  "Oh we love the game. Everything is great. Thank you so much" and what real players have been typing here since Beta. Your post is describing a revisionist and false history.
---
OMG I wrote this reply before I saw it was this dumbass, he spends hours a day with these BS responses. Sorry for wasting everyone's time with a serious reply :(
---
Not sure why you feel the need to color your opinion of my post with my (mostly conservative) history on topics unrelated to gaming, but thanks for commenting; have an upvote.

My brother quit playing cuz he kept dying to ppl at workshops in december, and also he disconnected a ton right after death. He was packratting things always so a death meant a lot lost if not recovered. When he is at work i would use his account to just transfer guns and ammo and flux. His account got the ban for holding all my shit for me lol. He's pissed. I honestly didn't think trading in large quantities would have an effect on any of this, or you bet i would have steered clear. I just didn't see trading items through another account to store them as an exploit. If im wrong, i guess explain so i can understand. But its not a far stretch for me to believe there is a decent chance at some form of a sloppy job from bethesda. Whether that be false positives, or whether it be slow sloppy work making a slap onthe wrist a more serious perhaps month long concern. Its totally reasonable to be upset from a dude who paid in full, before they already screwed me with a sale right after release, and a promised beta that was like what, 4 days? Eh you feel just as strongly about this as everyone else. Have your viewpoint. You arnt convincing anyone, and I pry am either so lets just let it be.
---
Illiterate moron.
---
I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre trying to do. 
---
Rant at Bethesda for stuffing up, or work out a way to get our rad builds working until they get this sorted? 
---
I‚Äôm only here for the second. 
---
Oof get class freak 3
---
So you can mess up their "experience" they just cant mess up yours?......Sounds about right.
---
Mule characters are against t.o.s. you idiot. 
---
r/AITA is a very interesting sub. I recommend it. Have an upvote.
---
But she always did that didn't she? I seem to remember her having radiation at least since patch 4
---
You‚Äôre literally using words to interact with others using words and your best insult is to question their literacy.
---
Perhaps the reason 900 hours guy gets a lot of attention is the possibilities of faulty play. Not the reality, but the possibility. 
---
I have 2 systems because me and my kids play. They have mules on my account and i have one on theres.  Mules "were" great.  And no real need to really play the mule longer than here hold this or i need that.
---
Potted plants do this to me
---
He's saying the word is "specialities" not "specialty's".
---
You get jail for murder while you just park badly your car...
---
Brigade harder.
---
So they have a right to mess up mine is what your saying there? What gives them more rights? Turrets outside there is a major dick move. End of story. Don't try that. If people are dicks I will be dicks back. If a low level player want to be dragged though there with an escort. Will help all the time. Let them tag shit. There is no way I can run in and tag all mobs before the turrets do there work. 
---
I ducked into a Nuke Silo (Alpha, PS4) the other day to help out a guy who had entered a bit earlier.  The generator had been repaired, doors opened, and I only had to replace 3x more mainframe cores before launching.  Never saw him, though, and not sure what happened to him, whether his system crashed, but it saved me a lot of time.  
---
Thank you; someone else gets it.
---
The point is a lack of facts is a lack or facts, people who say everyone is guilty and come on here to claim why with no actual evidence are just as ridiculous as those you claim are white knighting if they didnt dupe.  
---
says the guy bitching about losing duped items. 
---
Thanks for the clarification, would you mind taking some screenshots of the 2 versions? I would like to see how big they are
---
Saw the queen fall into the fissure once. At least 5 players tried going in for her loot. Didn't seem to work out. The guy giving the thumbs up from the bottom was pretty epic though.
---
I don‚Äôt mind those camps. Do whatever you want. Sound extremely boring to me though. 
---
Denial of all facts is a hell of a drug when you have selective fact acknowledgment. 
---
It was a misinterpretation.
---
I thought he was mocking me and trying to say the fo76 sub was only for meta building exploiters.
---
He explained this in a subsequent comment.
---
What gives the turret people more rights? Explain to me why its OK to be an arse?
---
74?!  that is awesome!  i am 15yrs behind her and still jumping out of planes.  :-)  hope i am still jumping at 74.
---
No worries and thanks :)
---
Don't worry about the local community, 169K subscribed and only a few hundred are vocal haters. I'm sure you know that most of the players just play, come here to get questions answered, and maybe to find some players to team with that post things they agree with. A few downvotes on my post don't indicate the sub has gone to deep shit :)
---
For the record, I'm usually downvoted cos Im the Bethesda fanboy. Most of us real fanboys criticize the company a lot, we just don't jump on bandwagons like Nuka Dark Rum. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the real fans attacked Beth for the disconnects and server instability, not for licensing or a very fair Atomic Shop.
---
Finally, check out /r/fo76FilthyCasuals if you want to know what a proper functioning Fallout community can look like!
---
Oh really? Your brother got banned for holding your stuff? You sure you aren't a cheater?
---
just 2-shot.  no explosive.  have not been lucky enough for that.
---
not at all. in the video, his base damage was 3.5k. on an unoptimized build. how do you explain that?
---
Yes, that totally makes it okay to lie about the game for views from dipshits like you, right. God you people are pathetic. 
---
But I just missed 4 shots in a row at a Scorched at 85% vats chance with my TSE Lever. I know it‚Äôs anecdotal but it seems I‚Äôm always missing similar sniper shots with my TSE but my Instigating Hunters Rifle hits as I‚Äôd expect in VATS. 
---
Is it just confirmation bias?
---
Absolutely. 
---
Ok, I got the custom ini from my brother, added the edit, and now the game works again.
---
i also have an explosive handmade.  
---
Whole heartedly completely. No doubt in the pits of my soul. 
---
Maybe you got banned as well and that's why you are defending this guy? That makes sense. 
---
Nah everyones decided mules are an acceptable exploit but everything else is bad. Dupers,campers,xp vultures TSE users etc are all evil but mules are cool. I dont personally understand it but thats the hypocritical consensus on exploits.
---
Sony became seemingly okay with x-platform a MONTH before BETA if i remember correctly. Are you seriously expecting them to implement that feature in such a short time? And would you rather have their network engineers working on that?
---
I am honestly stumped sometimes by the amount of sheer stupidity/ignorance people can have.
---
Defending him or arguing you have selective facts and quick rude assumptions?
---
and since you said there's no official statement confirming that it was designed that way, I'm inclined to believe it's a bug until Bethesda says otherwise.
---
OMG!! gimme!!  i got all the shotty perks!!  lmao
---
on PC
---
IGN  Immelmann
---
Explain to me why it's not okay to use a game's features to one's advantage. The highest/best use of the CAMP system is to use turret placement to kill mobs above one's level. it's like a portable team for solo players to enhance one's DPS.
---
But I get it, deflecting the conversation from the original point means you cant be wrong. 
---
I trust the analytics and metrics they used to do this over gaslighting pitchfork posts from a bunch of brigading serial liars.
---
Congratulations to you. 692 hours here on xb1
---
**Psychologists are professionally trained in not judging people.**
---
You are not.
---
They are among the best trained in not getting swallowed whole by a single viewpoint. 
---
You just showed how to be swallowed by a single ideological world view. 
---
Spare us. 
---
Let‚Äôs end this here. 
---
Maybe you were cheating without knowing? FYI, duping counts as cheating
---
Thanks for your reply; have an upvote!
---
Wait, energy weapon users actually exist? 
---
VATS is a way different animal. I believe TS decreases VATS accuracy, because I've experienced that too.
---
It's the same reason why Twisted Muscles decreases gun accuracy, yet it only applies to VATS and hipfire, not ADS.
---
AA hurts sent/cav gear tho 
---
look in the mirror some time whale
---
The only objective fact here is that Bethesda banned accounts. 
---
If you got banned, take it up with the proper channels instead of trying to corrupt the community with horseshit.
---
No but srsly, why would anyone defend this guy unless you were a cheater as well? 
---
On the rim of the fissure, which is where it was the last time I walked into a fissure (like 6 weeks ago).
---
Its a game feature to blow up camps. Doing so let's me farm WS with out having to make sure I tag everything and run the risk of getting surrounded. Try again
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I never duplicated. I was flagged (no permanent ban) for picking up and dropping 100k bobbleheads. I knew what it was and I used 30 of them on the SBQ and dropped em. I know what i did. But hauling my own items, nah dude. I got a lvl 118 lvl91 lvl 40 and lvl29. I gots lots of stuff. You seem to have a lot of personal aggression in these empty accusations. You going to be ok?
---
I used my real name because it is the name I use on my email. I get sick of account names I can never remember and getting locked out because of it, so I've started using my email as my account name. Stupid that our account names are displayed ingame, I expected my character name to display like in ESO.  
---
What does he do?
---
Cool well I‚Äôm using a feature in the game which allows me to blow you base to hell
---
I guess we'll just have have to agree to disagree, but thanks for your comment; have an upvote!
---
And I'll be sitting in the game in no time. Cuz I got nothing to hide and bethesda has finally made a statement on their plans. 
---
Maybe it is a bug. I don‚Äôt know. 
---
I‚Äôd love to be fixed. I‚Äôm the guy who wrote the min-maxing guides for maxing speed on the F4 subreddit.
---
I‚Äôm just not holding my breath though, and suspect it may be a deliberate ‚Äúeither-or‚Äù, with SD being the easy way, but without it being harder but capable of going faster (on a rad build + power armor + DMS + optimized (not overdrive) servos + well tuned. 
---
I am level 187 and until last night never came across it. Then TWICE last night it appeared. Heard the different dramatic music while just walking about and saw it in the distance staring at me. Went to run up to it to melee it and it flew away. I thought, "Damn, that was my chance finally!!". Then half an hour later i was running, very briefly heard the music again, but that time didn't even get chance to see it before i saw the black smoke and off it flew upwards never to be seen again.
---
So i guess, the tip is to once you hear the music and know it is around you somewhere, stop and have a good look, use VATS or whatever to try to pin point its location, then try and shoot it.
---
PS - I haven't bought any Mothman merch so it is just a week long bonus for us all to have an increased chance of seeing him. 
---
Is that what that was....   
---
I was in a Nuke Zone battling the SBQ and I see gamma waves just blanketing the area and rapidly taking down my health.  I downed diluted Stimpaks like candy and barely survived.  I originally thought that it was another player taking advantage of the chaos to reign death down on those fighting the SBQ and the scortched around her but when I had time to check the map I didn't see any Wanted players.
---
Thanks!! The state of things here has just got me down though.
---
Yeah, I noted that this only applies to PvE.
---
It doesn‚Äôt bug out every dc or whatever. I actually just played 4 hours straight without it bugging. And if it does I just relog.
---
/r/fo76 was constantly put down and attacked from /r/fallout since beta, is only this month that they migrated over here and ruined this place. I was subbed to /r/fallout for years, and last month I unsubbed from /r/fo76 as well. Don't understand why that crowd gets more kicks from following and griefing irl than from playing the damn IPs!
---
If anyone doubts this, go to /r/fallout. go back to Xmas dates on posts, and read a few... 
---
Wait what? You are banned as well? lul that explains a LOT. Thx for clearing that up
---
I believe that they like to play fo76 and people deserve endless chances. It is not fair for a game maker to take someones money then stop them from playing. I forgive the glitchers and dupers totally.
---
From what I know, all these posts about bans for mod usage were just fearmongering. Also, sometimes people said that they got banned while using mods because they didn't want to admit they used other tools or even exploits, which were the real reason for bans. This way, ofc other people might think that mods might be the main reason for bans.
---
I personally use mods since day 1 (and I use a ton o them atm) and I make F76 mods myself, which many people download and use without any problems. Still have to see even one negative response about bans for using my mods (Which are purely cosmetic, ofc). Nothing like that ever happened. (name's Rigell on Nexus)
---
Same thing happened to me in the Ulcite Cave near Cranberry Bog. (I got bum rushed by by M irelurk Kings and was lower on health than I thought!)
---
Thanks Mo0kish for the fix. Hopefully I won't have to try it, but if I do.....
---
get rid of your mods
---
I also agree with people mentioning the accuracy problem. I use vats alot and ts weapons have bad vats accuracy as people have said
---
I just started playing this game last night. Its very interesting reading these post. I guess I‚Äôm in for a long journey that‚Äôs seems unfair lol. 
---
One possible explanation is the rad worms bug that causes mutations and bonuses to apply incorrectly, making them stack much higher than they should. The "strange in numbers" perk can give you almost 200 extra damage and it also can stack incorrectly. There are many possibilities, you should trust the dozens of comments saying "I can only reach 2.5k" instead of the one random YouTuber that is magically doing high dmg in shit gear. You just want to hate on melee because your 2se got nerfed, all your old posts are about buying and selling shotguns lmao
---
You keep using words like defending. Did you not post here being tired of seeing shit? Yea me too, the witch hunt and crucifying people just cuz YOU want YOUR voice to be heard. The hypocracy is all over the place. 
---
So i should let people lag whitesprings and ruin the only source of peoples farming? Lol
---
Thanks a lot for this info, helped me with the issues caused by my own mods, actually! Fixed my nexus mod descriptions accordingly.
---
And keep dodging my previous statement . My logic doesn't fit your propaganda now does it?
---
I've seen people build giant concrete walls to block others from being able to do this, and I love it
---
No, server hopping like that has been patched for months... You hop servers and you won't see the junk you took earlier
---
Mate, anything i've bought in the atom shop was bought with the atoms i earned via the game. I've never spent money on this outside of the initial purchase of the game itself. You save that whale insult for someone who gives a fuck. 
---
Fact of the matter remains that you people, who lie about the game like this, and treat it as if it's okay, just because bethesda didn't give you a game that catered specifically to your needs and wants, are pathetic as fuck. You are the reason why this community is shitty. 
---
Ok thanks for the info! At 20lbs each, it‚Äôs important to make informed choices about the rifles I carry and how best to use them. 
---
Yes, I forgot to mention VATS. I don't use it, but I know hipfire accuracy is correlated with VATS accuracy.
---
Crazy. I use Glowing meat a lot with the multiplayer. Otherwise I‚Äôm fully stacked at Strength, with all the seemingly right perk cards for my two-handed along with Incisor and such. Don‚Äôt have any Unyielding though. I use a lot of drugs. My Grognak already has added swing speed too. I‚Äôve heard the Adrenal mutation got nerfed on the latest update. I still haven‚Äôt seen anything like 600. That would be dope. 
---
You 100% sure on that? Gonna install the patch today. Want to be sure before i start removing mutations
---
Its a ESH scenario really. I only blow up turrets cos they force me to rush in there. And I don't even farm it to be fair. I might pop in there once I log in to have a go and finding gear. Im not a true farmer there. More of a Gardner :) but it does boil down to not enough good spawns for getting legendarys or xp for each party so they clash in the only good spot. 
---
No problem!
---
Explain why my brother is pissed? You repeat yourself a lot and dodge conversation, but sure act like you have convinced anyone other than yourself, who came into this convo with a mind made up. 
---
White Springs isn't the only place to farm XP.  It's a place that offers a ton of XP with the least amount of challenge.  There's other places that can provide as much XP if not more.
---
Yeah and for sniper rifles hip fire is usually bad so I stay away from ts weapons lol
---
Personally I don't see why Bethesda can't just make setting up c.a.m.p at the Whitesprings null and void. Problem Solved XD
---
She lands much much less and carpet bombs none stop. We almost failed our first run after patch. Had to swap characters to my heavy and take it out. 
---
I'll make that distinction more obvious in my post, actually. I should do that
---
Damn algorithms
---
Again, the primary charge of "YTA" is directed at Bethseda for creating an intentional shortage of efficient XP opportunities. There's no reason for there not to be more areas with rapid mob spawning. Thanks for your comment; have an upvote!
---
What are you even talking about? I JUST did Watoga High School twice. Yes its a well known spot to farm plastic, but a few server hops and I found a "fresh" one to farm.... about 5 mins ago.
---
What gives you the right to dictate whats right and wrong in this game? You want to trash a camp do it,thats your choice, just dont act like your the lesser of 2 evils. Somebodys experience is getting ruined based on self righteous thoughts better them than me though, right?
---
I never take of pacifist and never been 1 shotted...after the patch when u could not stack bobbleheads anymore. 
---
Yeah yah enjoy your ban. I can tell you are biased towards cheaters since you got banned for cheating as well. Lemme know if you get your account back. I doubt you'll survive this since you were hoarding enough to get someone else get banned 
---
THeres also ski equipment so she skied. That must mean if she hadn't studied at Vault Tec she would have been a Raider Boss.   
---
Mods? I'm doing a scan/repair see if that fixes it.
---
Biased toward cheaters? Man you really just make shit up. You should work on fox news. 
---
Just check here for the solution:
---
Downvote for post, upvote for this actual logic. 
---
I will give you a screenshot of me when I log on tho. You being a prick doesn't change reality :) 
---
Agreed. Ultimately, Bethseda's the asshole for not creating more areas like Whitespring.
---
yes, it was reclamation day something.
---
I just don't wanna converse. You are obviously pissed off at bethesda cause they banned you, you are pissed off at me for talking shit about cheaters. I don't expect any positive outcome
---
Keep reading. People fuck with my game experience I'm likely to do it back. Who says I'm dictating what is right/wrong. Its a dick move to have to force someone to change the way they are playing for your own sake. I've said this. Force me to rush in there I will destroy the reason behind it. Do I make out I'm better? No. Its arseholes being arseholes. 
---
Got a 3 star medics vats explosive submachine gun off of a legendary 3 star bear in sbq fight blast zone few hours ago.
---
Yet using a melee weapon you are susceptible too taking armor damage, however using a ranged weapon if you're good then you aren't. So the overall repair costs and ammo needed balances out. Good try but you fail.
---
Her diploma also has her SPECIAL stats on it.
---
Scorchbeast Queen is glowing?
---
I'm lvl 12 and just bought the game. You. Fucking. Idiot.
---
There ya go sayin shit. Where am I pissed bud? I just want you to continue this to show others who you are as a person.  So they can ask themselves what happened. 
---
For an equal amount of challenge? For players under lvl 50? Do tell (no seriously, I started at Christmas and am only lvl 20 because I work for a living and have kids...help...).
---
&gt;You probably don‚Äôt treat your mother or children like that, using asshole behavior. 
---
you'd be surprised.
---
&gt;I was having this crazy notion that we shouldn‚Äôt treat anyone else like assholes either. I say we because I‚Äôm human too and I do it too.
---
I treat people the way they deserve it. and the team behind Fo76 doesn't deserve much.
---
&gt;It doesn‚Äôt imply the people we shouldn‚Äôt be treating like assholes have thin skin.
---
it does, sometimes. which only aggravates me further. it's not like I'm being unfair, although you clearly disagree with that. point is, you messed up, just own it. people like that are not in a position to argue, let alone if the point they're trying to make is that their feelings are hurt.
---
&gt;Well maybe just getting to that point, from where they started, was a huge undertaking you don‚Äôt have the vantage point to understand.
---
and that's the team's purview, which is subjective by definition. it has no bearing in the discussion. what I *do* know is that modders with no budget at all can do an infinitely better job, that's gotta tell you something.
---
&gt;And when people come, consume it, and then spit on it and insult you, the person who worked for years on it, you won‚Äôt cry or scream, you‚Äôll say fuck them or whatever and go home at the end of the day. But it‚Äôll feel like absolute shit.
---
and what's wrong with that? it's suppose to. they're not doing a good job, not even doing a mediocre one. I'd rather someone told it to my face. they deserve whatever comes to them at this point, this isn't a case of 'mistakes were made' anymore. it stopped being forgivable a few patches ago.
---
&gt;And when we do treat each other like assholes, be prepared to get asshole behavior called toxic. Because, well, it is. 
---
not gonna argue that. just that, by the same logic, some folks will instantly associate you with the far left, like I did. glad I was wrong.
---
Reality is that you are banned and Can't play while I'm enjoying my camping life in wilderness of Appalachia
---
TS doesn‚Äôt hit anything on automatic. The recoil is out of control. 
---
Grasping at false accusations in order to dodge cognitive dissonance.  Classic move for the emotionally unstable. 
---
But there's posts like that all over the front page and have been for months?  This is as silly as the people who claim we bury any criticism of the game.
---
Wait. Honest question - what's wrong with "mules"?  
---
I was hoping to eventually build up a shop CAMP on a separate character, and just toss all my other stuff - like known plans and ammo I don't use - over to it to trade/sell.  
---
Is this considered a mule?
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/0N7WjZC.jpg) is from the day I first got adrenal reaction, I wasn't that low on hp and I was totally naked from getting mutations the free way. Learning to optimize it without making myself a total glass cannon took some work and experimentation. I recommend taking radicool and keeping yourself around the 50% radiation mark, but also taking healing factor to keep yourself topped off and deceptively tanky.
---
And? It's a week off vacation. I work 45 hours a week. 
---
I was told those numbers are a visual bug with adrenaline. I‚Äôve gotten similarly 1000+ damage values on my rifles with the same build as you.
---
I feel sad for that people downvote you, you made a joke and even if you mean it, still it is your opinion. I think fanbois are as salty as haters. Life balance.
---
Which weapon? TS shouldn't affect recoil, only hipfire spread and VATS.
---
you do know there are dozens of different branches that specialize in different treatments, right?
---
Don't think that's gonna happen. Mods deleted this thread
---
Yeah. The LMG has been shit since launch. 16 damage max... No upgrades. Yet the same round does 140 ish on a sniper rifle. Funny how the AK with a smaller barrel does more damage
---
Today was the first day I could play in ultra without lag. Nice
---
it's one of my favorite things. they are so perfectly done ...I love them.
---
How long did it actually take between the first and second though? There's an implemented delay on them being visible again for you
---
Sure will. Still here
---
&gt; You sure do love to call people stupid for somebody who blindly follows rules and never questions the company who put them in place
---
Because you fucking are. Rules are put in place for a reason. You don't exploit the game for your own personal gain, when it tells you literally in the game's terms of service which you agreed to when you started the game. Full goddamn stop. Like...this should be the end of the discussion right here. 
---
&gt;Bethesda is trying to shift the blame to people who used exploits that THEY gave them. 
---
No, they aren't. They're rightfully banning people that are exploiting the game. Which it says in the TOS that you can't do that. 
---
Lets say I cheat in a game. Knowingly. Do i deserve to get banned for it? If you answer "Yes", then you have no fucking reason to defend this guy. There are no "buts" for this. if you cheat in a game then you 100% deserve to receive the consequences of your actions.
---
&gt;No, you‚Äôre going to use the same terrible engine full of exploits and bugs used for singleplayer games? Then you‚Äôre going to be mad at people who do what they‚Äôve always done? Ridiculous, man. C‚Äômon
---
Doing it on singleplayer is one thing, but in multiplayer it's completely different. You're affecting people. 
---
By duping TSE weapons or whatever the fuck the meta is now, you ensure that no one is going to be able to go up against you. You could, theoretically, take over an entire server with the amount of ammo that fucker had. What legitimate player is going to be able to go up against some fucktard in power armor using explosive weapons and shit? They wouldn't be able to set up anything. It's cheap. That is why it's against the rules, you absolute fucktard. 
---
Even if you aren't running mods, you can run into an issue where Atom things don't show up. I had to make a custom ini file, and edit it. 
---
But you are being unfair. 
---
You‚Äôre judging people from a position of complete ignorance towards the real wold choices they had in their circumstance, judging form the outside. 
---
You‚Äôre an over-opinionated armchair critic who wants an excuse to behave in a way you find emotionally rewarding. Who either thinks he knows more than he actually does, or just doesn‚Äôt know how to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know enough, so I‚Äôll stay out of judgement‚Äù, or **needs** to judge others to feel good about himself. 
---
Not a good look no matter which of these you are. 
---
Played 20 min on ps4 before the first crash.
---
Found the dumb cunt. Congratulations!
---
I asked if you were 19 because you were acting like an immature child and your name had the number 19 in it. Next time I want to ask a similar question I‚Äôll make sure to specifically pick a number that isn‚Äôt in their name.
---
I'm currently screenshotting to use your mentality and attitude as an example. Thanks for the odd maga country mentality. 1 Mexican a killer they all killed get em out! Lmao.
---
Yeah that fixed it, I was using text chat but that's gimped until further notice. Boo.
---
Even if you had .ba2 mod files in your DATA folder, they're harmless there. The key is your Fallout76Custom.ini. 
---
If you aren't modding or editing some settings, delete it. The lines in the Fallout76Custom.ini override the Fallout76.ini (which you shouldn't edit as it will update).
---
If you want to disable mods without deleting your Fallout76Custom.ini, then delete the line/s that mentions: 
---
    archivelist= 
---
This is not the exact name. Most mods will tell you to use the atom shop archive list, which is currently:
---
Considering they still haven't addressed the thing that kept me from advancing in the main quests... Yeah. I think I'll keep it uninstalled.
---
I removed the mutation and re applied it, as well as the other 10 I lost. It worked for about 45 mins until I died a few times in a row at the queen, relogging fixed it. I then played for about 4 hours straight without it messing up again.
---
I‚Äôm not defending dupers, I‚Äôm defending people who were falsely banned. Why are you lying?
---
My main has a similar name to this. I use this account now because the other got banned for a silly reason. Just waiting until it‚Äôs unbanned.
---
&gt;One possible explanation is the rad worms bug
---
no such thing at the time the videos were recorded.
---
&gt;The "strange in numbers" perk can give you almost 200 extra damage and it also can stack incorrectly.
---
I'll give you that. but I don't think it can stack up to 2.5k extra damage.
---
&gt;There are many possibilities
---
you cited two.
---
&gt;instead of the one random YouTuber
---
two now.
---
&gt;You just want to hate on melee because your 2se got nerfed
---
whether I'm right doesn't matter, 2.5k is plenty op. like I said a few posts ago.
---
Some will, most won't... best advice, Stash often.  That way even if someone does take out your character, you don't lose all of you're junk.  You're junk drops in paper bags and if you get killed anyone can pick it up.  However, you keep your weapons, armour, aid, etc.
---
Personally, I will, from time to time, just craft a good weapon for low level players and escort them around a bit higher level areas to help level up.  Plus, I'll drop a collection of plans for players to sort through.
---
TF? this thread is deleted man. It doesn't show up for others to see. And in case you hadn't noticed, YOU are the laughing stock here not me
---
The only people who associate me with the left are idiots who can‚Äôt quite wrap their tiny brains around the world not being divided into two neat buckets of prescribed opinions that every human on the planet *must* belong to one of. 
---
you wouldnt happen to have an extra tattered field jacket?
---
Lol if they actually reply to you. It seems majority of the time they just ignore you
---
If I were you, I'd just use "mildlyinterestingyet" for my account name everywhere.
---
Anyone that got banned deserved it 
---
They did something wrong and now they pay the price 
---
I shouldn't be surprised that since you cant find a way this could be spread to others, that it cant be screenshot and added to the official thread any time I need context of someone being irrational and aggro :)
---
Damn. Thanks. I got to get my shit under better control. I‚Äôll look into that. I want to max out this Grog. 
---
Is that why you get the most downvotes on this whole post? Man, you seriously delusional seek professional help.
---
Any hints? Let‚Äôs make this a treasure hunt
---
Only twice? 
---
Melee is the only way to do decent damage now, all the guns feel like pea shooters.  That would be a dealbreaker for a lot of people, unless they buffed guns at the same time.
---
I can get you some downvotes if you want, it's obvious you are the one who's doing it lul
---
you dont have any mods installed on your game? 
---
Yep PS4 Player.. I found a bag of tons of items in it enjoyed... Im banned... Good thing I platinumbed... And lost the game :D Nice and easy
---
Do it then haha 
---
So it's one of those guns at sporting events they use to shoot hot dogs and t-shirts out of at the crowd?
---
No idea. I'll send you a message on Xbox tonight. I waited to about 750 but had to bail so I could get to bed. I'll hold the plan for you no worries
---
We got to start making noice so we get a fix now and not 3 weeks from now! Not tempted to remove mutations once again 
---
I have said no lie. The game is indeed bad even if they fixed the bugs it is fundamentally flawed on a technical and design level, and we have seen bethesda employ multiple manipulative tactics through the atom shop that are straight out of the depth of mobile gaming we have no reason to trust they won't try to exploit us if we cut them any slack. 
---
What's pathetic is you long time bsg shit drinkers who go with whatever todd says like a bunch of sheep
---
&gt;But you are being unfair.
---
unsurprising you think that way.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre judging people from a position of complete ignorance towards the real wold choices they had in their circumstance, judging form the outside.
---
I'm judging them based on the fact this dumpster fire has barely improved in 3 months and they can't fix things modders could get right in 10 minutes or less.
---
if I, an "ignorant outsider", can fix basic bugs, why can't the team with access to the source?
---
&gt;Not a good look no matter which of these you are. 
---
I guess you're the shrink now.
---
&gt;The only people who associate me with the left are idiots
---
people who unironically use the term "toxic" are automatically associated with the left. that's just how it is.
---
If bethesda banned you they are in the wrong unless your profile has code showing you diped or something along those lines they need to fix it and honestly reward you for the ban. This game has been a joke so far and honestly if the update I'm downloading does not fix the issues iv been dealing with I'm done with the game and selling my disk. Iv put a lot of time into this game, like many others, and so far the players have been the main reason I'm unhappy with the game. Bullies and assholes is all i come across lately, usually working in groups with with simular names, one attacks you and if you fight back you get gang up on and killed then they destroy your camp. It's already lame that they made fallout an online only game but they steadily fail to address the actual issues we face trying to play their lackluster game. If they do not reinstate you honestly I'd get a lawyer. It sounds petty but that's a lot of time invested and if you actually did nothing wrong then bethesda needs to make it right. I'm thinking like a metric fuk ton of atoms, reinstate your profile, plus more
---
I don't agree that 2.5k is op, you have to have a tiny sliver of health for it to work and you can do the same thing with a bloodied ranged weapon. You can get full automatic weapons that hit for 400+ and absolutely melt anything in seconds, 2.5k is a lot but it has a lot of disadvantages and the overall dps isn't great because you are running around with 25 hp and die often. 
---
also, some items are not what you think they are.  like i bought the vault-tek bed, and it was not there.  i had to buy a modern bed, or some thing like that, to get what i actually wanted.
---
Also, where did you see they nerfed adrenal reaction? It's not in any patch notes, I just went back and looked. I haven't played since the new patch so I don't know if they really did.
---
Most melee users seem to agree that it needs a nerf. The difference between overpowered melee and overpowered ranged weapons is ranged weapons can kill instantly from a distance, melee weapons have to rich  up close. This means a disadvantage in pvp and it means they can‚Äôt do shit against a scorchbeast or queen unless it lands.
---
Agreed üëç
---
Or have the ability to select 20 to craft and then start.  It will automatically craft 1 at a time until 20 made, pausing 1-2 seconds between each.  Like a progress bar showing while crafting.
---
Shotguns always have spread, but with the spread reduction park unless you go quite the distance you can keep the spread fairly small
---
&gt;you have to have a tiny sliver of health
---
sentinel, cavalier. or even protocoled PA.
---
&gt;you can do the same thing with a bloodied ranged weapon
---
no ranged weapon in the game can hit for 2.5k under the same circumstances that a melee one.
---
&gt;You can get full automatic weapons that hit for 400+ and absolutely melt anything in seconds, 2.5k is a lot but it has a lot of disadvantages and the overall dps isn't great
---
it's precisely the opposite. with faster swing speed and martial artist, your dps is far higher than any auto weapon. mainly because each swing hits for a ludicrously high amount.
---
Yes, TS lasers are nice. Once they rebalance, it'll be my main weapon 
---
used to be rather common on the vendors untill the vendor blueprint patch. I have gotten a few random ones of treasuremaps and marine is allways at watoga vendor.
---
Could be confused but I‚Äôve seen that people are pissed about something Adrenal being affected. 
---
God damnit Bethesda...
---
Yeah you've gotta repair the pad and be in control of whatever area has the pad (the power plant, munitions factory, steelworks, etc) before the flares will work. 
---
Meet those conditions and throw the flare and the vertibot will show up and machine gun your enemies!
---
&gt;The game is indeed bad even if they fixed the bugs it is fundamentally flawed on a technical and design level, and we have seen bethesda employ multiple manipulative tactics through the atom shop that are straight out of the depth of mobile gaming we have no reason to trust they won't try to exploit us if we cut them any slack.
---
Not what i'm talking about, bucko. I'm talking about yongyea and his misleading circlejerk against this fucking game. 
---
&gt;What's pathetic is you long time bsg shit drinkers who go with whatever todd says like a bunch of sheep
---
You misunderstand me. I fully acknowledge that the game is flawed, though despite that i do enjoy the game. Because apparently that's hard for people like yourself to fathom, because apparently it's not okay to enjoy a fucking game just because people like yourself shit a brick because it wasn't built to your specifications. 
---
No, sir. It's you that's fucking pathetic. You're like that fucking child in walmart whose parent won't buy them a toy and so they throw a shit fit throwing everything around and screeching like a fucking animal in public.
---
I had a similar experience are you on PS4?
---
Sure go ahead brah. Lemme know when the thread is up
---
You must be new here. You serious?! 
---
Any automatic weapon. 
---
Handmade, assault rifle, 10mm SMG, you name it. 
---
TS blows both recoil and hip fire accuracy so far out of the park that your third shot onwards is basically coming out sideways, no matter how many recoil control mods you strap on. 
---
A furious/AA/bloodied will place all 20 rounds in a handmade with a perforating magazine on target. Maybe 19. 
---
A two-shot is shooting at the cloud from the third shot on. People who use it either use it in non-auto/2-shot bursts, which loses you the x20 damage from accurate auto-fire, or they use it like a melee weapon, running to every target to compensate for the inaccuracy. 
---
It‚Äôs a crude spray and prey weapon, not a disciplined automatic. 
---
It's actually worse on weapons that can be modded with armor piercing, or are receiving armor piercing from another source, since it's multiplicative not additive. Ideally you want a single, largest source of armor piercing, additional sources are going to have diminishing returns.
---
Also there is AA perk card. If perk card is applied first and then comes Legendary effect, then later one will have even less damage.
---
Strange in Numbers is also broken as of patch 6. Seems to be unrelated to this bug with Adrenal Reaction.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asja3o/strange_in_numbers_is_broken_after_patch_6/
---
It‚Äôs not even difficult to get XP, literally everything you do gives you XP... scrap, build, kill, take a shit. Literally everything. 80% of the things you pick up from an enemy in whitesprings can‚Äôt even be used so why set a camp there? ~120 hours in I hit level 50, play the quests, explore, kill enemies that are near your level. When I was around level 20 and first got to whitesprings all I did was follow around the higher level players and they didn‚Äôt care at all I was leeching off them as long as they got the XP and loot. I was happy because I got the same.
---
Moral of the story is don‚Äôt be a lazy fuck in a game just like you are in life. Get up and do some work, shit doesn‚Äôt come free. You set up camp like a prick next time you‚Äôre back it will be gone if I pass by. 
---
FYI you don‚Äôt need to say I‚Äôm an asshole, I already know ;) but at least I have courtesy and standards.
---
That‚Äôd put a lot more on servers, linear tracking from x (hash function?) big O
---
Somewhat related question, does this extent to shotguns/flachette harpoon guns? I know in fallout 4 two shot would only add one pellet, instead of another shell. If this is the case, I imagine AA would be better for those weapons
---
I realised today if you don't touch either of the joysticks when exiting the bench, it seems to leave ok.
---
Good suggestions...but lets be realistic, they cant release a single patch without braking something.
---
How the hell would they succed at those implaments?
---
Meanwhile,all my arsenal who is 100% duped that i bought for caps is still here,i thought they were gonna do a big deletion of duped items
---
Today I had to log out and log back in to finish that line 
---
Do yourself a favour. Don't click on his videos. Don't comment or downvote. Next time you see it pop up on the recommended feed:

1. click on the 3 vertical dots in the bottom right just under the video window
---
2. select not interested
---
3. Click on Tell Us Why
---
4. Click on I'm not interested in this channel
---
You won't see it again on your recommended feed.
---
As with these sorts of thing in real life, the best thing to do is to sap the wind from its sails by not engaging at all.
---
It wasn‚Äôt tse in general (though that was very strong), it was tse shotguns. The explosive damage was multiplied by the number of pellets, so if there were 8 pellets and the explosive damage on legendary explosive guns was 20, it did 160. 20x8. Doubling that with demo expert, using an explosive bobble head and adding in the shotgun perks for good measure made for a downright broken weapon.
---
Nope - not true.  I just had the same experience on a high-spec gaming PC with a 1080ti.
---
"continual game freezes , severe server lag and eventual drop out from server"
---
This is absolutely the norm for 76.  The game constantly lags and freezes in weird ways - more so than any other game I've played.  It's just unstable and full of bugs.  These issues manifest themselves more so when the server is under heavy load.
---
After the 2/19 update, the SBQ seems to spawn wayyy more minions.  It's more fun, but it definitely felt like the game/server was struggling to keep up.
---
Still need this armor?
---
You really are bad you know that? You don't go wild meleeing the queen, you power attack while spamming ap items. I have unyielding sentinels marine armor, it won't save you from the queen when you have 25hp, and the main problem anyway is the radiation unless you want to manage radshields during the fight. Most people settle for melee in power armor so they don't have to worry as much, and without stacking buffs your damage is 1500ish with just power armor and bloodied and mutations. You can stop crying about op melee at any time buddy, you are noob trash that doesn't know anything about endgame min max mechanics and what the meta op builds are. You haven't even mentioned the OP commando sneak crit vats builds. 
---
I've used TS with multiple weapons, those weapons you listed don't experience more recoil...
---
Why are you mentioning other legendaries? I never claimed TS to better than anything but AA; those increasing damage are just up to personal preference. I personally believe Bloodied is the best, followed by TS, Furious, Mutant's, then Instigating.
---
I have a friend who mainly uses a TSE .45 SMG, and from what I can tell, the bullets always seem to land on target and kill fairly quickly. He never complains about accuracy either.
---
You have to realize that automatics also just plain have more recoil. It's not the TS part at all.
---
I know what you mean and it‚Äôs annoying, but you can use bats to teleport next to them and hit them.
---
www.sadtrombone.com
---
Ya I had rad worms pre patch, all my other mutations work perfectly fine but I only get negative value for adrenal reaction, please make haste with a hotfix lol
---
It‚Äôs somewhere on the map between crevasse dam and dryer chemical it‚Äôs not always there and you‚Äôll know you‚Äôve found it because you have to loot a body wearing that particular costume that coincides with the plan example find a witch body should have the witch costume plan or hat plan fine the skeleton body it should have either the costume or hat plan unless somebody got there first 
---
Sorry lad, didn't get banned.
---
I just had the same thing happen tonight.  She's way tougher than she used to be, and spawns 2-3x as many minions which crushes the server.
---
Fought her a few times last week and never had a problem with varying squad sizes, as low as 2.  Today we lost the quest and she flew away.
---
No, everything is the same except you can 'start' taking the workshop from anywhere within the boundries of the workshop. Before you had to walk over to the actual bench and click it to get the 'are you sure'. Now you get that same message from anywhere in the boundaries by entering workshop mode (from my XBOX controller, it's holding SELECT down a long time).
---
I dont speak for OP, but I assumed he was saying 'I build a room around my workbench to protect it, now that doesnt help anymore'
---
Regardless of the point you are making, you tried to make it while being a bit of a sarcastic bitch. So people are going to dish it right back at ya.
---
Good to know, thanks. I was sniping from a distance, I guess the sneaky sniper build has a slight flaw. 
---
TS does only add an extra shotgun pellet, but I'm about 90% sure that TS also increases the damage of each pellet to make it do that 125% damage. You can compare on the pipboy and see that as well.
---
I have no idea about the Fletchette, I'm sorry :(
---
You pick your primary legendary effect for the biggest DPS increase. Your choice is not ‚ÄúTS yes or no‚Äù. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúS/Bloodied/AA/Furious/other‚Äù.
---
TS is better than other. But worse than all the others. You have an exponential drop-off from enemy DR **and** from distance. 
---
You‚Äôd rather 1x200 shot (furious/bloodied) or 1x100 shot where enemy DR is halved (AA) to 2x100 shot. 
---
the queen isn't the only mob in the game. yeah, melee sucks in nuke zones. does that justify it dealing 2.5k damage per swing?
---
&gt;You haven't even mentioned the OP commando sneak crit vats builds. 
---
still nowhere near as good.
---
Your post was about people above level 50.  I'm talking about people above level 100 who are still nuking White Springs and farming XP.
---
I have 3 different TS BP pistols lol. Almost all of my TS drops have been BP pistols. I also have a TS tesla and a TS auto grenade launcher. Thanks Beth, you really give me the good stuff...
---
You need it equipped.
---
That was more my experience, it was hard to get her to land for a while.  We ended up losing, and she flew away, which has never happened.  Bummer.
---
Its not hard to figure out. It was based on server delay (lag perceptually to us) and you just experiment with said lag. Once you know any condition where the server has a delay, you start doing stuff in that 'window' of opportunity.
---
Naming them is important. I want to put a Z in front of all the stuff I want to keep so they go down the bottom of my inventory when sorted alphabetically and I want favourited/marked items to be unscrappable.
---
Level 100+ ex-player, guide-writer (if anyone cares): The top tier prefixes are Bloodied, Junkie's, and Furious (semi-situational). Two-shot is an alternative for a 'no-strings' damage boost for weapons where the accuracy drop won't bug you (no-vats builds, shotguns). Anti-armor is PREFERABLE to two-shot on any weapon with NO OTHER available sources of armor penetration AND if you care at all about accuracy. Other viable alternatives depending on the weapon are Instigating and Quad. Secondary effect you want to be looking for explosive bullets or increased fire rate (preferably the former). I imagine a viable alternative for Survival mode will be the +50% crit damage for player killer builds. Tertiary effect you want damage resist while aiming. Barring that the runner ups are reduced vats cost and +1 agility. In my opinion these are what can be considered 'god rolls' right now.
---
Hi! I'm just dropping in to let you know that I think you're an asshole! I hope that tomorrow you wake up 30 minutes before your alarm and can't get back to sleep. Bye! 
---
Oh that sucks then, thanks for the reply! I was trying to decide if I should level those up or level up my Power User perk. 
---
This game engages in very poor consumer practices and if it experiences any success or profit they would very likely make more like it (they said this was an experiment after all) any sign of support is not ok if there is some element from this like of shit you liked you could find it just as readily in many consumer friendly games on the market (for example subnautica for explorers, base builders, survivalist's. Borderlands for shooting things with friends) 
---
The market us saturated with options there is no excuse for accepting comprise yet you stubbornly persist in your delusions. Your divergence from reality and willingness to be used by an uncaring corporate overlord is quite pathetic.
---
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying? If you're asking what I prefer, it's Bloodied.
---
When it comes to max damage, Bloodied, Furious, and Junkie's have the max potential; they max out at 150%. But we're not talking about that.
---
I'm simply saying that TS doesn't increase recoil.
---
You don't fight the queen in the radiation zone... She has an aura of radiation that only affects people in melee range. You have a distinct advantage with your bloodied shotgun. 
---
Spoilables and the rest, would be huge for QoL
---
big oof
---
Well, yeah it's bugged and doesn't work at all for some people, it's partially working for others and some have it working just fine. No nerfs at all, just classic bethesda coding.
---
I‚Äôve found at least 12 TS weapons from farming WS, I didn‚Äôt get my first until I was near lvl 100 but since I got my first I do ok. 
---
Exactly OPs point. Youre an ahole cause your so personally offended that someone play the game in a way you dont and you will punish them for doing it. You've decided that whitesprings turrets are wrong and if you see them you take it upon yourself to trash them, thats you being "better" 
---
Excuse me, Mr High and Mighty, but you might notice that my question was asked BEFORE that person had posted an explanation... So am I supposed to travel forward in time to find my answer? 
---
You could do with some bolstering gear, for the brain.
---
but isn't SBQ around 400 DR and sometimes 800 DR?
---
Also bloodied doesn't cap at 50%
---
Hey, at least there is some kernel of truth in the logic...   .grin.
---
&gt;You don't fight the queen in the radiation zone... She has an aura of radiation that only affects people in melee range. 
---
no way! really? /s
---
point is, yeah, melee isn't good against rads. *still* doesn't justify the 2.5k tooltip.
---
&gt;You have a distinct advantage with your bloodied shotgun. 
---
shotgun have to be really close and don't deal 2.5k damage per shot.
---
How is a game that easily includes a hundred+ hours worth of quest and exploration content overpriced, even at $60? Just because it's not the game that you wanted doesn't devalue the game content as it exists. There are a lot of games that have far less gameplay for the same price, just look at anything EA has put out in the last two years.
---
I agree with you, mostly. But the terminal entries and audio logs are the best written they have been let. IMO. I don‚Äôt mind reading them at all. But the fact that there isn‚Äôt even just one survivor around is a bit ridiculous. 
---
Yes, Bloodied, Furious, and Junkie's have the max potential for damage. That's why I noted that, and also said that TS doesn't affect regular ADS accuracy, except on the weapons I meantioned. Just as you said.
---
However, AA is only ever possibly better than TS when hipfired or in VATS, regardless of the enemy in PvE.
---
Nothing, people just like to pick and choose what exploits are ok to use. I say use them all, others say no your a filthy cheater for using ones i dont use. It was just funny to see posts with people ranting about server issues cause of dupers yet you had people throwing thousands of pounds of items onto mules and not a peep was made. Cause mules are necessary.
---
Queen resistances never change, only HP.
---
Yes, Bloodied reaches it's +50% cap at 20% HP. It's equal to TS, +25%, at 50% HP.
---
Melee is strong however rifle stealth vats build is strong as well. I can 2 shot 3 star legendary easy with my crappy lvl 45 lever action rifle.

‚ÄúMule‚Äù characters are essentially a method of circumventing a deliberate weight limitation. It makes sense that Bethesda would frown upon them.
---
Personally, I‚Äôd be playing it safe until there‚Äôs official word from Bethesda on they‚Äôre looking to crack down on...there‚Äôs a lot of rumour and conjecture being peddled as fact around here. 
---
&gt;The logical conclusion is if there's no point in having that much ammo, and they don't say he's duped anything else then why would he dupe ammo, and nothing else at all that's actually valuable
---
the logical conclusion is he duped the materials to craft ammo. what a backwards way to use logic; "if he only got ammo that's proof it's of no dupe" \*while\* you just admitted yourself it's something you craft.
---
&gt;Also you talk about the gym for lead and shit when that's not how people who actually know how to craft ammo do it.  
---
wrong. 2 lead ore gives you 5 lead. 10 lead ore is 50 lead. using the excavator on lead heavy mines could yield up to 30 ore at most - we're talking about 150 lead ore (which requires acid by the way!) gained through considerable amount of time (running through a whole mine).
---
in comparison, the different gyms grant you:
---
* charleston fire depertmant: 60+ lead
---
* green country lodge: 50+ lead
---
* vault tec university: 20 lead
---
* palace of winding path: 30+ lead
---
in addition to gyms, there are other locations like the hardware store in a grafton city (forgot the name) which gives 25 lead (5 cans).
---
hopping servers between these locations will give you far more lead than you could get with an excavator armor, and requires no acid. do keep in mind that the locations i have listed are not even half of the locations with highly concentrated amount of lead.
---
&gt;a few hours gathering could do a months supply of almost any amount of ammo. 
---
agreed; if it was for one or two ammo types. but over a million ammo? for so many weapons? with over 200k of them being ultracite? you'd have to put in some serious work every day for 30 days, which, again, i seriously doubt anyone with a sane and reasonable mind would do. craft 100k of something? OK; fair enough. guy likes being prepared. nevermind that it weighs a shit ton and bogs up your stash; whatever floats his boat. 200k of something? OK... i guess... 300? nah, 600 fucking K! like dude, **no way**
---
the more you talk about it the more you just look like a shill/duper/friend trying to fix for your friend.
---
It‚Äôs not that shocking considering that is what the vault was designed to do. 
---
Early bird gets the worm
---
Yeah a good chunk of it is retreading your own opinion, but I just wanted to get everything in it, even if it's already detailed in your post. (Good psa btw)
---
I‚Äôve only had this happen with Scorched, I assumed they were dying from their disease. I‚Äôm only level 19 so I‚Äôm still working through the story, unsure if it is a glitch.
---
I encountered a diseased super mutant this past weekend. I paused to observe him and try to get a sneak attack, then realized he was in combat... with another super mutant. I‚Äôd never seen that before, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a bug or if they attack their own if they are diseased.
---
As I said autocorrect but I must say you have a good eye I recommend you use it
---
I did not have any mods of any sort at any time. I did NOT have a custom ini file.   
---
To fix this issue I actually got the custom ini file from my brother, and edited it as directed in this thread. Now my Atom things work again. 
---
Yeah, thanks man. I agree with your secondary and tertiary affects, too.
---
lol, yup!  :-)

this is amazing, thanks for the tip !

i use a meat pile glowing mod.  helps me locate those meat piles in tall grass.
---
Seems like alot of people are experiencing the same thing with adrenal reaction.
---
Once in 212 hours (saw him at the 199-hour mark). It was so creepily fantastic.
---
I think that the rarity of the sighting enhanced my enjoyment of it. I can‚Äôt help but feel a little disappointed that the frequency of appearances has been tinkered with. 
---
the healing factor also not functional.
---
IF U CANT FIX UR SHIT JUST REMOVE RADWORMS.
---
Way to lame up one of the best events in the game. Hope it gets fixed soon. Only nukes I've seen on pc for at least 3 months
---
The only dumpster fire I see is the system that gave you and your ilk such poor emotional regulation skills. 
---
I guess.... Thought the neon letters spelling it would've helped.... Question though, without starched genes lvl 2 how would they keep the mutations either way?  With that perk the mutations are locked in (I have Speed Demon And Marsupial and constantly use my decontamination shower)
---
Yep I‚Äôve had a fair few rolling pins, drills and just bobby pins from legendaries at whitesprings, their loot is pretty poor. On the plus side though flare guns have been taken out of the legendary loot pool so that‚Äôs so,etching I guess
---
Ive killed 40 *** legendaries. Ive gotten 2 *** items (1 from an SBQ), 2 ** items, and 36 * items. Something is fucking wrong with this system.
---
Sorry, just venting. Imma watch the video now.
---
Useless for consoles. 
---
I saw him twice today. Before that I had only seen him once since beta, and that was very brief. 
---
Yo.  (Thumbs at self)  ...maybe.
---
I mean, I'm really happy they're moving in the right direction.  But when your biggest update accomplishment is that you changed a config variable from 600 to 800 without breaking the game...that doesn't exactly scream elite, well staffed development team to me.
---
That said, I get the impression that they're working uphill against a chaotic mess of spaghetti code (mostly due to the regressions they've had with old bugs coming back).  They could have some really competent folks working hard, but you can only do so much so quickly when your code base is a few jenga blocks from falling over.
---
I live in hope, I could use some too üëç
---
and what is better?
---
1. ts gauss + adrenalin reaction (when work...)?
---
2. blody gauss + adrenalin reaction?
---
I saw him once during the beta but never since, scared the shit outta me
---
Same here. Only saw him once and that was over 200 hours into the game. I actually fast travelled far northeast because I wanted to explore... and got plopped right into the middle of a fight between it and hermit grab. Killed the crab and then had to deal with Mr. Hoppy. Made for intense experience.
---
Tse does increase recoil. Take a normal vs ts/tse weapon that's auto and test it out. It did at least in fo4
---
Absolutely 
---
This doesn‚Äôt follow if you look at their reasoning for not having real npc‚Äôs. They didn‚Äôt say that they didn‚Äôt include them for story reasons because it will be cool to include them later. They said they didn‚Äôt want to include them, because as a game design choice, they wanted all characters running around in game to be real life people and not to cause any confusion about that fact. 
---
If the decision is a game design decision, I‚Äôm not so sure they will add some in the future. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want them to add them really badly. I just think that if there were open to it/able to do it, they would have already done it. 
---
Yeah that's my worry. I'm ready to move to another game. I'm just so bored and wasn't ready to be finished playing fallout. I'm mostly watching many a true nerd fallout challenge runs to pass the time. Might try fallout new California. 
---
Well, that depends on your HP. Bloodied becomes better than TS when you go below 50% HP, because Bloodied does +25% which is the same as TS, at 50% HP.
---
I love Bloodied and I always keep half my HP full of rads to take advantage of Bloodied, but if you want to have full HP, just go with TS.
---
I'll try to simplify it as much as I can: it's not my problem if it affects them, **especially** when they are very much at fault for delivering such a poor product with terrible support. and to prove that I'm not exaggerating, a modder could do a better job.
---
I just dont get how they are able to mess up something after every update
---
Yeah I agree, it was awesome when I first saw him because at first I had no idea what it was. He didn‚Äôt hurt me, I went up to him and after a minute or so he was gone in his cloud of smoke. But I still am looking forward to the Flatwoods monster, I‚Äôve still yet to meet him. 
---
Actually also a sloth, actually never saw one of those
---
Explosive increases recoil, I believe. TS doesn't.
---
One door closes and 3 more open, it seems like.

I like everything he said and agree wholeheartedly. AT LEAST MAKE 3 STAR ENEMIES DROP 3 STAR LOOT BETHESDA!!
---
Cool! I hope they don‚Äôt make him like a ghoul for the next week, where you see him 59293 times :P I still like him scaring me when he appears haha
---
You mean unlike you, who must spend hours on here bitching about one thing or another. Maybe it's your PC set up. Maybe you're just rubbish at gaming. Maybe you should go back to playing Spyro the Dragon or Farmville. Maybe you should get lost.
---
My screenshots shows otherwise https://imgur.com/a/NhqdSDH
---
Anyone that doesn't believe him deserve the fucking bullshit they get from Bethesda bug filled monstrosities  
---
Keep believing in Howard next E3, bunch of cucks
---
Yeah excactly. Would probably be wise to test the game before releasing it to the public
---
Your problem, not them, is the reason you‚Äôre spraying sensationalist statements like ‚Äúdumpster fire‚Äù. 
---
You want to judge something HARD to be satisfied, and be seen doing it, and Bethesda just gave you an easy target. 
---
It‚Äôs probably not even your fault. You didn‚Äôt pick your brain chemistry any more than I picked mine, and different brains regulate emotion differently. Mine, for example, is weaker at it, which is why I treated a lot of people like an asshole over my life and why I write long posts nobody reads on reddit. 
---
I should have been clear the spawn is next to Abby's bunker, but it only spawns if you come in from a distance.
---
&gt;**Wanted:** We‚Äôve made an adjustment so that players must now destroy objects in another player‚Äôs C.A.M.P. or Workshop to become Wanted, which should reduce cases of accidental crime.  
---
&gt;**Workshops:** You can now contest a Workshop that‚Äôs owned by another player from anywhere inside the Workshop‚Äôs build area, which should make it easier to attempt to contest a Workshop, even if it‚Äôs been barricaded by the owner.  
---
&gt; **Server Maintenance:** As we work on world servers that have been running for a long time and hitting some lag issues, we‚Äôll be performing maintenance on those servers more frequently. You may receive an in-game message alerting you to this maintenance when it occurs, and you may be asked to join another world. This should improve the play experience for everyone during your adventures in Appalachia. 
---
I see problems with the above changes. I dont really understand how they can't predict some of these problems.
---
**(1)** Players could easily grief your base by getting all your camp items down to 1 hit, and then throw a grenade or artillery for the last finish, destroying everything in one go before you could do anything to stop them if they dont go to wanted before destroying an item. A better alternative would be to require players to sheath weapons when entering a camp area or turn wanted.... or ya know, use the existing passive mode. perhaps a popup warning and option to turn it on?
---
**(2)** The workshop change is lazy and the odds of finding a player contesting your workshop now will almost guarantee they take it over before you can do anything about it, especially with stealth / chameleon. A better change would be to make players wanted only in the workshop vicinity for destroying barricade  and lockpicking.
---
**(3)** This is going to be a disaster with nuke zones unless you add a way for nukes to merge onto another server when you "ask" people to change to another server for maintenance. Even if you give an hour notice, it can take that long just to get through the silo  for new players.
---
You could just finish the main and side quests for XP, loot, and materials.
---
Enjoy the game; don't rush through it by farming as much XP as quickly as possible.
---
By the time you finish all the main quests and the side quests, you'll easily be above level 40 (at least).
---
You have Adrenal Reaction, or anything else I'm unaware of that increases damage with low health.
---
üòÇ
---
Thanks for the info! Keeping the main gear makes it sound ok, kinda fun actually, might be interesting to try and escape an actual person, especially if there's some sort of stealth mechanic. I'm in!
---
AR is currently bugged and working
---
I tried non explosive TS and I‚Äôm pretty sure recoil on it was worse than vanilla. 
---
I thought, since Fallout 4, Two-Shot literally fired two shots, each of which would be reduced separately by resistance. I know I can see that my Two-Shot missile launcher files two missiles.
---
I think the "125%" is only given as a single number for damage displays, but it in reality it does 100% (bullet 1) and 25% (bullet 2).
---
I‚Äôm loving these bans bahhahaah
---
Many people share the same thought. Youre probably the 6th person ive seen with this serum issue.
---
Oh, yeah, I forgot. There are some perks that increase damage as well.
---
Hm, it's always felt the same for me.
---
I was not talking to you.
---
Bug:

If the roof is on the building and you try to place or move a pot plant, the plant flies up onto the roof.  The only way to place them inside is to remove the roof and replace it after placing the plant.  This occurs when placing the ferns in covered balconies and verandahs. 
---
I didn't have Nerd Rage equipped. 
---
They do cry alot on there.
---
&gt;My statement was directed to counter a statement that proposed the principle of limiting speech and had absolutely nothing to do with OP.
---
absolute bull and you know it. let's run through the context again, lest you think changing goal posts are fine.
---
the entire thread - mind you, the context, which is quite important - was about how this guy was unfairly/wrongly banned. a top level comment to which you responded to said this:
---
&gt;the more i read this sub the better i feel about taking a small break from the game and playing other games 
---
it's quite easy to infer with the context that this posters message affirms the story of a wrong ban and it happens to sway her or his feelings for the game. this is where you pop in writing:
---
&gt;All that's left is the awkwardly positive posts and front page threads with titles: "Playing in an abandoned server is literally the best" since those are the only people left playing. Sad at the same time. 
---
you're saying "I don't care who cheated. I don't care that the person who I replied to was replying to another person who was replying to OP." like you can just wash your hands after the fact by saying you don't relate or care to it. but let's be honest here. your comment here:
---
&gt;Playing in an abandoned server is literally the best" since those are the only people left playing. Sad at the same time.
---
is absolutely a bash of the game and the developers. more-over, it's also a bash toward people who still play the game. but whatever, this is reddit and people are allowed to share their feelings even if they are misplaced or based on lies. what happens next however is the most damning part:
---
&gt;Awkward is the posts that dissent from the mere expression of opinion and not the opinion itself. Just because people pop back in occasionally to see the state of the game they hoped was going to be good isn't a disparaging act. Criticism is the best chance consumers have at improving an out-of-touch business. 
---
this is in response to people who cautioned you to not jump to conclusions and to not let your emotions be swayed. funnily enough, by responding as if you were defending yourself, you implicitly admit that you are one of those who "pop back in occasionally to see the state of the game", but at the same time you are willing to ignore truth and listen to lies that affirm a negative state of the game.
---
even so, all of that would be OK for a reddit standard. it's OK to be negative and lost in an echo-chamber. but then you just had to end your message with:
---
&gt;Grow up.
---
and what's this bullshit about "criticism is the best chance consumers have at improving an out-of-touch business."? you're saying this game is shit in the context of a cheater being banned unfairly - then you quickly change tracks, saying you don't care about the cheater or anything about that; then why the fuck are you even posting? how can you simultaneously pretend to be sharing earnest criticism and at the same time trivialize the hype kicked up around a banned that turned out being just?
---
it's the worst type of hypocrisy. and you couldn't even see it, with all of that explaining. cherry on top? pretending that i am "refuting an argument that was not presented by an opponent (you)": or do you seriously not see what it is i am refuting? incompetence or unscrupulous, either way it lessens your credit.
---
but like i said. feel free to pop back in on this sub and jump on the first chance you see to project your anger at the state of game. complain at people who tell you to chill. then say they are all overworking it, and downsize the whole hype you just took part in, trivializing shit you kicked up because it turned out being wrong. what can man do against such reckless retardation?
---
I think the think that scared me the most was the music/noise when you meet the Mirelurk King.. fast traveled to Cranberry Bog and as I started off I hear this creepy shit, turn around to that little bastard.
---
Maybe if you‚Äôre used to some level of spray and pray it‚Äôs less noticeable. 
---
Configure it to reliably place your entire mag on target on full auto and try to reproduce that with a TS. I couldn‚Äôt. 
---
In ADS, every weapon, except the ones I mentioned in the post, will do a single, simultaneous 125% hit on a target. VATS and hipfire are different.
---
Done this a few times while fighting scorchbeasts whilst not looking where I‚Äôm going lol
---
My experience is that 10+ people make her practically unkillable in time as her effective health scales super-linear to the number of players. Now that bloodied seems to be bugged/nerfed, one can't rely on hard hitters anymore either.
---
My very first nuke hit prime and we failed her after spending 5k ammo with 12 people. Later, I could solo her with the same build (vampiric gatling gun w/ anti-armor perks) under 15 minutes as I had to dispatch the ground mobs myself too, pre patch 6. Post patch 6, the loss of Martial Artist buff on the gatling gun had me kill her in 20 minutes with a group of 9 people, 2k ammo spent.
---
A little extreme to call someone names for liking an ASPECT of the game. And only because their opinion is different from the majority here or there.
---
I had a ts auto combat rifle vs reg combat rifle and i could have sworn it was increased. I tested this in fo4 just recently but maybe it's not exactly the same in 76. 
---
I was testing in 4 to see what had more recoil, ts or the violent effect, which was +25% dmg and +25%recoil. I was curious since they knocked ts down to 25% dmg, and I wondered if there was a difference between those effects. The violent effect had the highest recoil. Followed by ts then default. I'll have to test this when I get on with some of my weapons. 
---
That's probably what I'll do. If I can find it for cheap I'll jump in.
---
So they decided the way I play it is wrong and have done that to hamper my progression. To leech of the way I play. It not me being better its giving people who play the same as me a chance to go in unhindered by the playing of others who force me to rush there. Its ESH, as I have said.  They think the way they do it is better by your logic. No one win here. No one is better. 
---
Actually I prefer to battle people my own level or close to. However anybody is fair game if they look the part.
---
if something‚Äôs terrible i wouldnt advertise it even more, that just gets the low effort youtubers more views and more $$$
---
I figure everyone is affected, and still no word of a hotfix. R i p bugthesda 
---
Hm, I'm not sure. I've just seen a chart that showed a 50% cap, but it may be wrong unless you have some bonus that you're not even aware of, which I think is the case
---
I know I know, very true my man's. Just frustrates me. 
---
Well you're the one trying to incite a witch hunt because my opinion is different than others.
---
The stash increase really makes my life easier. I can finally dump a heavy weapon and still have space to accumulate bulk junk so I have a reliable supply in case I ever want to build anything new for my C.A.M.P. I was surprised to find that COPPER and RUBBER is necessary to build conduits. I had just vendored a bunch before.
---
I killed the SB Queen 3 times yesterday and didn't encounter the out-of-bounds bug people talk about. Is it back?
---
I don't know what to say about the dupers/cheaters who got banned. I am, though, a bit skeptical that you could come across 100,000 rounds of ammo even if you're trading things back and forth and/or possess a mule. So I side a bit with Bethesda.
---
also, i feel this needs to be reiterated, because you so brazenly glossed over that part:
---
&gt;you also said 'grow up', as if you were in any part exemplary. you're just here whining, ignoring basic facts, telling others to grow up because they don't instantly believe a sob story at face value.
---
cheers buddy
---
Yeah, I've hardly messed with TS auto. You sure that wasn't just the recoil from auto?
---
They used to, idk why it‚Äôs fuccked up rn.  Recent patch didn‚Äôt do jack shitt, probably only made it very slightly better. 
---
show me the chart
---
They were enemies too strong for your current build/level. They happened to be attacking your base, same thing happened with NPCs in Fallout 4.
---
Who knows, but good testing
---
The loot is just a bonus cherry on top of those sweet caps!
---
Google "fo76 bloodied percentages"
---
Yes, very surely 
---
Autos are the most powerful weapons in the game. They start out weak, but if you carefully manage them to hit everything then shoot, a handmade does an order of magnitude more damage in 2.7 seconds than a gauss, forgives misses better and takes an order of magnitude less time dispatching a mob of 20 enemies. 
---
I'm nearing lvl 120. I have religiously farmed, never traded for anything. The best weapon I have is an instigating black powder rifle. Which gets the job done for everything but the Queen with my rifle build. But I could farm for ten more years and never get anything better, given the odds. What annoys me the most is actually leveled items. What, you got lucky and found a TSE instigating dragon? Too bad it's a level 5 weapon and so it's damage will always be less than half of it's potential. Which makes it useless, and most events that don't drop lvl 50+ items not worth your time.
---
Console players get all the fun while PC is full of players breaking servers with exploits
---
I had nothing else over **just half the limit**... only .50 ammo at over 100k. Yet I'm banned.       
---
I asked Bethesda twice for a reason but you won't get an answer without thousands of upvotes...       
---
So yeah... call me liar, duper or cheater but I know that I got banned for stupid .50 ammo because for the ban-script 99k fusion cores are fine but 101k .50 not...
---
i'm only joking, i don't work
---
It for sure wasn't instant, but it took no more time than it did to go to Whitespring and clear out the Golf Clubhouse building and then back after a server hop.
---
It's not in "Google News" it is you're Google News "feed".  You don't have to click follow for it to send you this info it just sends it based off of your searches:)
---
Yes, it really is sad because I was looking forward to a Fallout game with awesome PvP and raiding elements. The people here and there have mostly done everything to sway Bethesda away from it. 
---
I have hope that Survival servers just may attract some like minded people. Except these same people are trying to dictate that mode too. 
---
In my experience this genereally happens if you revisit an area too often with one character. In Watoga you can trigger it just by going into the instances in the area (like the hospital and civic center). Once the bots start dying in the streets, the mobs in the hospital and civic center will also suicide. 
---
If this NPC behaviour is a bug or if it's a game mechanic to prevent farming I leave up for discussion.
---
&gt; I separate people who dupe for themselves or their friends vs scuzzy people who are just doing it to make real-world cash (ick).
---
A cheater is cheater - we don't want cheaters here.

I posted the exact same thing a day or two ago and got downvoted.  This sub has a lot of toxic people in it, ignore their childishness.

A fact is a fact my dude, just because you don't like it does nothing to make it not a fact. You can take issue with him as a youtuber but once cosmetics give a tangible gameplay bonus they are no longer just cosmetic.
---
I‚Äôve seen some people using a mod for the aid tab where if you press a button it arranges them into food, drinks and chems. 
---
If just the players are able to create a mod where this can be used to benefit the game then I don‚Äôt see any reason why Bethesda aren‚Äôt able to do the same
---
I really liked the first suggestion. My twist on it would be that it doesnt learn that exact effect. It could learn any major, minor, or prefix. And it wont learn every time, much like how we scrap weapons and armor now. 1, 2, or 3 stars would change the likelihood of us learning a new effect for that weapon.
---
* = 33% learn new effect
---
** = 66%
---
*** = 100%
---
Still keeps that fun bit of "what am i gunna get", but makes me want to farm more and be excited getting every legendary. It would also boost the market with people that do effect services.
---
Fighting the queen for me is terrible, the lag is almost unbearble, people are just stationary, then got disconnected after a while, died, disconnected and lost all of my precious lead I was carryin.
---
Didn‚Äôt make much money &amp; not going to fund a dying game, so we‚Äôre the test servers
---
I aimed at a protection lvl 50 or so and pulled the trigger only to realize I'm outta ammo, but it died as if it hit it....... I laughed but seriously, I've seen room fulls of them robots just up and die in the whitespring bunker.
---
I‚Äôve never used it let alone saw someone ‚Äòs C.A.M.P. having artillery piece. What about your experience?
---
Good suggestion. We want some randomness, farming, and hard-mode but not impossibly rare and unlikely drops.
---
I wouldn't assume the worst in people, I bet most of them don't realize what they're doing.

all faction vendors have connected caps, like raiders all have the same 200, responders all have their own 200 etc. so you can only sell for 200 on one vendor in each faction before the whole faction‚Äôs vendors are out of caps

Shogun + Enforcer perk + 2 knee caps help me with Deathclaws usually.

Ive been playing a few weeks and loved it- had hardly any problems. However the last two days ive been kicked from server 5 times... but it stables itself eventually. Its still so fun regardless and although it feels like an uphill struggle sometimes... still love it, so says a lot 
---
&gt; This game engages in very poor consumer practices 
---
Oh please. 99% of you didn't buy the collector's edition for the bag, and if you did any research on the fucking rum thing you'd have seen that the case was never meant to be glass in the first place, and they've been banning people that dupe something that's against the TOS in the first place. Cry me a fucking river. 
---
&gt;if it experiences any success or profit they would very likely make more like it (they said this was an experiment after all) any sign of support is not ok 
---

&gt;if there is some element from this pile of shit you liked you could find it just as readily in many consumer friendly games on the market (for example subnautica for explorers, base builders, survivalist's. Borderlands for shooting things with friends)
---
K. but i don't want to play those games, in fact i fucking hate borderlands with the same passion as you hate bethesda and i have no interest in subnautica, if i wanted to go play a game, where i scuba dive i would load up bioshock or go onto ark and go get my ass eaten by a fucking mosasaurus or a pliseosaur or a lieoplurodon or a fucking shark, i want to play Fallout with my friends without having to use a broken ass mod on a computer that will burst into flames if i do. Stop using this as an argument, you twit.

&gt;The market is saturated with options ]
---
Those options don't interest me and aren't what I want.  
---
&gt;there is no excuse for accepting comprise yet you stubbornly persist in your delusions.

There's no excuse for being a pathetic manchild throwing a bitchfit because they didn't get what they wanted.

&gt;Your divergence from reality and willingness to be used by an uncaring corporate overlord is quite pathetic.
---
I'm not being used. Again, I have literally never spent any goddamn money on the atom shop and anything i did buy on the atom shop came from the atoms you earn in the game by doing challenges. because, y'know that's possible and has been possible since the game launched.

There's an explosive defense perk. So your wrong- cute math but your still WRONG. ANTI wins..  I ate Fatman's and two shots today from a group of try hards. Only guy who could kill me was using bloody build and armor piercing. TSE is low level PvP or PVE only now chumpy

Real late to the party, but I must know. Where is the rock arch at? I‚Äôve looked at your post multiple times trying to locate it based on the background but I simply cannot find it.

I feel like the previous patch was much more significant.  Server stability for me was much improved after that one, it is now actually worthwhile for me to take workshops.  The new patch is going in the right direction, sure, but the only thing I personally noticed was the stash increase, which IMHO is a result of the increased stability from the previous patch!
---
I'm not knocking it, regular updates are great.  I just think this isn't their best work.

Paul Howe, former Delta Force and retired policeman shot this down already.  Look him up and his thoughts on revisionist 2nd amendment enforcement.  Not possible at all for the government to take everyone's guns away given the amount of them in possession and logistical aspects of patrols in an area to target individuals.   At least not in our lifetime.  The seas will be over cities and the crops dead before they take the guns away.  
---
Btw, if climate aware people got off the gun talk, I think we could get more done on this world before it kicks us off.  Just my two cents.
---
Okay here's a tip. If the game crashes, open up task manager. the game will overlap task manager so you won't be able to click anything but don't panic. Just press F and delete. F will will let you select 'F'allout 76 process and delete will terminate the process. easy
---
Thanks for the feedback, I‚Äôve been thinking of reinstalling, doing a solo play through for more immersion, and actually doing a competent character build. It‚Äôs nice to see the game has been making some improvement and still has a community.

Tent workshops can be done. A PITA granted, but possible. Try this layout

TSE is for people with no aim and who spray and pray.. so we're already off on a wrong foot assuming he can calculate accuracy... 
---
That is bizarre.  You shouldn't need a custom.ini at all (if you are not tweaking). All the custom.ini does is override lines found in it over the ones in fallout76.ini.
---
So maybe your Fallout76.ini is didn't update properly (locked to read-only?). Can you open your Fallout76.ini and find the  line:
---
    sResourceArchive2List=
---
It should read (without touching it at all) as:
---
     sResourceArchive2List=SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2 
---
If it doesn't, it means for some reason the file did not update properly with the patch.
---
If it did not update, I'd recommend deleting (or just moving it out somewhere else as backup) the fallout76.ini and then in the bethesda launcher verifying the installation. It should then redownload that file from the bethesda servers.
---
"Cute math?", "chumpy"
---
Yeah, sure, dude. Cute way to project your insecurities there, pal.
---
No one here is talking about explosives, dumbass. TS is better than AA, and explosive defenses don't have anything to do with that.
---
Good thing Bethesda is just fine with perks being considered "required".
---
Yes, but more importantly:  Tab/category total weight numbers.
---
I'm surprised I didn't get banned, I duped a LOT. Like I had 50,000,000 of nuca colas along with millions of other shit and I logged back in today after not playing for 2/3 months and to my surprise I along with my friend weren't banned. 
---
By that do you mean Adrenal Reaction? I haven't looked it up in a while, but I've seen the numbers for Bloodied on Reddit too. Who knows where that post is.
---
More of this, please.
---
There are more comprehensive guides on the interwebs than this but there's basically 7 vendor "factions" in Appalachia each with their own factional pool of 200 caps daily (i.e. resets every 24 hours). This means each player is limited to a maximum of 1400 caps per day not including travel expenses.
---
Initially you'll be limited to just the Responder and Raider factions in the Forest (generally found at train stations, but there are others) but as you make you way southeast and progress through the map and the story and the faction quests, you'll get access to five more vendor factions like the Whitespring Resort, the Free States, the Brotherhood of Steel and others.
---
Also just in passing there are a handful of wandering vendors BUT they are SUPER rare and shouldn't be relied on as a source for daily cap runs.
---
Ghostcrawler must be enjoying this show 
---
Genius.
---
It all makes sense now...
---
Right here.
---
Most people on this sub are in complete denial of where this game is headed.
---
It‚Äôs cool to like the game and enjoy it and not care if Bethesda back track on things hey said hey wouldn‚Äôt do. But don‚Äôt get upset at people pointing out the facts.
---
Bethesda: you should use some survival and some damage perks for a balanced build
---
Players: I WANT TO USE ALL DAMAGE PERKS AND STILL BE UNKILLABLE. BETHESDA PLS FIX
---
Can Confirm this happens all the time for me... For me when my friend steps out of his PA I can see that but not him, and the second he clicks enter the PA disappears again 
---
Agreed.  Why were so many people desperate to get their hands on a TSE weapon?  Because ranged weapons are generally weak compared to melee.    So yeah, you have a valid point about people doing 'naughty' stuff to make the game less grindy. 
---
And Bethesda did a terrible job of balancing this game. 
---
Everyone goes to White Springs and Uranium Fever to farm loot.  Those are fine for lower to mid- level players, but you see players well past 100 there to. Why is that?  Because there's nowhere else to go, which is ridiculous. 
---
The right side of the map should have events that are much harder but also more rewarding versions of White Springs and Uranium Fever.    I think this is what they were going for with the "Scorched Earth" event, but they killed the incentive by having the queen drop loot that is awful and very few legendary drops from other enemies. 
---
Event missions in craberry bog/ Watoga area should be high- level versions of White Springs and Uranium Fever, but they aren't. 
---
Some time ago i got downvoted into oblivion for saying exact same thing. I hate exploiters as much as the next guy but in case of F76 they were a remedy for a horrible RNG system. I mean in 300 hours my best drops were executioner's/haste moleman gauntlet and bloodied/haste pitchfork and two 2-shot black powder pistols. I sure as hell enjoyed the game much more when i finally bought my TSE combat shotty and it only took a week or two of caps grind.
---
i think 100k ultracite would be do-able, especially if you trade. i just don't see it happening with over half a million ammo, with over 200k of them being ultracite.
---
they might also have tagged other things that we are not aware of.
---
&gt;just feel like when it comes to bans we should take everything into consideration 
---
that's exactly the point. you should never take any side for granted. companies should always have transparency, so players can see how and why the decisions are made. conversely, players should never be believed at face value. it's hard to prove your innocence, and you shouldn't, so it's up the bethesda to prove your guilt.
---
Same here, Fort Defiance as well.
---
I‚Äôm level 76 and I haven‚Äôt seen him once. Feelsbadman
---
I sometimes try to aggro the ghouls in Clubhouse, tag them and do funny Benny Hill style running around not finishing them and waiting while others join our fancy party.
---
How do they do 2000 damage? Iv'e maxed out my perk but only do like 350 with all rise 
---
Woah, missed the reports of bloodied being bugged/nerfed.  That would explain a lot.
---
The map in this is great! Thanks so much
---
Nobodys better is exactly right but you are definitely trying to make the case that you are cause you earn your xp and they dont. Youre just mad cause you dont like how they do it and insist and prevent them from earning xp unless its done how you want. You can still get xp off a turret kill if you destroy their camp they get no xp at all.
---
Yup
---
Agree, I am tired of shuffling through power chasis to find armour I need. 
---
I really don't know if I should up vote or down vote for this one ü§£
---
Interrobang.
---
Yes, but it seems to be broken to the point that reapplying the serum won't give the positives anyways so no reason to even try.
---
Its affected by health not rads. You get buffed even from taking damage
---
Basically in your DATA folder for the game are .ba2 game archives (packages of data that contain the model meshes, textures, UI, etc.). The Fallout76.ini tells the game to load these files when the game launches.
---
    sResourceStartUpArchiveList = SeventySix - Textures01.ba2, SeventySix - Textures02.ba2, SeventySix - Textures03.ba2, SeventySix - Textures04.ba2, SeventySix - Textures05.ba2, SeventySix - Textures06.ba2
---
    SResourceArchiveList = SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, SeventySix - Materials.ba2, SeventySix - Meshes01.ba2, SeventySix - Meshes02.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, SeventySix - Sounds01.ba2, SeventySix - Sounds02.ba2, SeventySix - Startup.ba2, SeventySix - Voices.ba2, SeventySix - ATX_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX_Textures.ba2
---
    SResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - ATX_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX_Textures.ba2
---
So the Fallout76Custom.ini file is telling the game to load up all the main game textures, load up all the main game meshes, load up all the main game sounds files, load up all the other main game files and then finally load up the Atom shop data.
---
Modding introduces additional and overwriting .ba2 game archives. e.g. a map texture replacement adds a file called  UHDmap.ba2. Inside this .ba2 file is just a folder structure and texture to replace the map texture. Something like Data/Texture/UI/Map.dds or something.
---
So what we do to make the mod work is add this new file to the end of the game archives list loaded.
---
The benefit to the Fallout76Custom.ini is it just overrides what the Fallout76.ini.
---
So before, we had a line in our custom ini as
---
    SResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - ATX_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX_Textures.ba2, UHDmap.ba2
---
So the game loads everything as before except the new line loads the atom shop items PLUS the mod.
---
The last patch changed the names of the data archives and updated this line to match the data package names.
---
So we had to do the same in our custom ini:
---
    SResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, UHDmap.ba2
---
I saw that post, it says it's for AR. And some bloke linked it saying it's for both AR and bloodied without evidence.
---
Yeah, that's why I said I'm not talking about that one. However, that person might be correct in saying that, because Bolstering also follows that same pattern.
---
Yeah, WTF is up with bloodied? My bloodied explosive prime receiver .50 cal was showing less damage at 19% health and all explosive/heavy perks than my trash mob double gatling gun. 
---
Sorry man but I decrypted one for fun and there is no way a casual player will ever figure that shit out... Even in the animated game trailers it said that with friends you can launch a nuke by combining codes... Reddit is that group!  If you don't wanna see them don't look but it's part of the game and not exploit...... However on a survival server the codes should be attached to account and unique.
---
&gt;Your problem, not them, is the reason you‚Äôre spraying sensationalist statements like ‚Äúdumpster fire‚Äù.
---
what else would you call it? there's nothing positive about Fo76 development. it's a continuous display of incompetence. I'll say again: **modders**
---
&gt;You want to judge something HARD to be satisfied, and be seen doing it, and Bethesda just gave you an easy target. 
---
seriously, where are you pulling those assumptions from? no, it's just that I have to live with their mistakes, that's why.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs probably not even your fault. You didn‚Äôt pick your brain chemistry any more than I picked mine, and different brains regulate emotion differently.
---
you're trying really hard to justify their mess ups, aren't you? I don't know about your brain but I know it's natural to be angry at a point when it almost seems like their doing these things on purpose. "there's no way anyone could mess up so bad", one would think to oneself. it's completely justified at this point, really.
---
&gt;Also, you can associate me with whatever imaginary totem you erect in your imagination and label ‚Äúthe left‚Äù.
---
you're thinking too much into it. just like you see me being toxic and then label me as such based off your preconception of toxic people, I see you (and people like you) typing "toxic" unironically and assume you're just an insufferable jerk. which was solidified by the rest of your sentence, and the rest of this lengthy discussion, really.
---
&gt;I can guess what country you‚Äôre from, and yes, we kinda look down on you guys for it,
---
I have a general idea where you're from, too. and a good chunk of the world is mocking you for your current geopolitics. in fact, your... "docile demeanor" is probably a product of it as well. but hey, we all have our ups and downs.
---
&gt;Also. I‚Äôm not the left you insist is implied every time someone uses the word toxic, so there goes your theory.
---
we had already established that a few dozen posts ago, yes.
---
&gt;its really you, not them, who is forcing that association
---
it's a meme at this point. it's definitely not just me.
---
&gt;Where I live, toxic is not what a political side does.
---
and that's why Trump is seen as the devil instead of just a republican. the west has gone limp.
---
Three months to fix mamma dolce doesn't exactly scream full scale, crack dev team does it. They also managed to break some mutations anyway so it wasn't a flawless patch. The Jenga block analogy really nails it considering how rad worms could give you lvl 4 lockpicking. 
---
Who is this Beth and what does she have to do the the storage slots? 
---
Scorchbeasts are. The aa like stabilized and it's the damage stacking with tenderizer and the syringer that take her down pretty fast. On my end I see a lot of grey in the bar from indirect damage done by other players.
---
If it's me and a friend, we have no issues taking her out no matter who's there.
---
There's other tricks to farming her you'll see it a lot, but has to do with the drop. The guys I seen there today are all in pa xD Which is fine if you need it for stabilized but know when to jump out and manage health/chems and down any livers early.
---
I showed up late for queen today and it already took too long and quest failed. Ended up killing her anyway. It's all about the aa, perks like adrenaline, tenderizer, and stacking the syringer. Imagine the damage if even half the people there did this.
---

I have seen a Mutant Hound attack a Super Mutant, it was weird.
---
Banned?
---
\&gt; Everyone goes to White Springs and Uranium Fever to farm loot. Those are fine for lower to mid- level players, but &gt; you see players well past 100 there to. Why is that? Because there's nowhere else to go, which is ridiculous. 
---
Well. there are loads of other places to go, but not with the guaranteed legendary spawn. I do got most of my legendaries just roaming around and encountering random 3\* mobs, but once you explored the map, you are not going to constantly explore anymore (except for certain junk and plan runs perhaps).
---
This is to passive. Bethesda should give reasons for ban. But you only get a standardized email. Make a ticket &amp; ask but as of now the very most GOT NO ANSWER at all.       
---
Imo it's far from ok to say...    
---
'Bethesda didn't admit false bans and don't give reasons despite having actual numbers SO all those help-me-I'm-banned posts should be put on hold &amp; discussions make no sense'        
---
No they shouldn't stop posting and they shouldn't get deleted from mods here. Because even if some exploiters are in between, most banned players clearly have not even idea for what they got banned or do know how exploits work.       
---
Also I have dozens of examples of false bans on my friendlist... I wonder what would happen if YOU got banned too.
---
I've had some luck by either traveling away from the area, turning tracking off then back on then traveling to the place where my loot should be or dying in the exact same spot as before with no junk to drop. 
---
I know it's a lot of effort, but I was desperate to get my ballistic fiber back. 
---
Yeahyong warning. This is old news. The guy is slippin.
---
Ya fk that prat lol
---
From what I can infer from reading here the sbq battle and loot is much improved and people are going for it. I had epic fun with it today. Big shout out to the guys who launch.
---
This. I was trying to do the vox dart quest and kept killing the cats with my plague walked mutation ü§¶. Killed then all before I could figure out why they just kept dropping dead
---
What's your build and hp%? 
---
That makes sense, but the Mirelurk Queen situation was the 1st time in days I was in that area. The other times it was the 1st visit to that area, that day. 
---
I think you don't actually do 125 damage at once with TS, but do 100 + 25 damage, each bullet vetted against the DR individually:
---
`100 * ((100/185)^0.366) * 0.5 = 39.91 dmg`
---
`25 * ((25/185)^0.366) * 0.5 = 6.01 dmg`
---
Total: **45.91 dmg**
---
My handmade has a base damage 77 dmg/shot with Tank Killer 3 and 2x1 Rifleman:
---
`77 * ((77/185/0.36)^0.366) * 0.5` = **58.21 dmg**
---
I don't use Awareness so I don't know exactly what damage is dealt with ingame, so correct me if I'm wrong.
---
the blackbird and camo are the only power armor paints that actually look good and fit in the wasteland so i was really disappointed to miss the blackbird paint
---
It happened to me yesterday night, we started fighting the queen, on her last health bar i noticed i was not dealing damage when she was at 75% health.
---
Everybody was shooting all kinds of weapons to her, but whe was immune.
---
At some point she landed and stayed on ground for good 2-3 minutes. But still immune to TSE/melee and everything else. We were more than 10 players.
---
At the end everybody left, but I have to say it was a good xp farming factory down there, enemies were respawning because she was still alive. I had to leave cos I was getting hit very bad when almost everyone left.
---
Pretty annoying bug, obviously event failed and no loot for anybody.
---
I'm annoyed that they sit and harvest the stuff I spawn when I go there before I have a chance to do anything. I never fast travel there if there is a person there as I want a chance to get the loot I have spawned in that  location. If you are doing a silo run and some one runs in after you have cleared the way and then they launched the nuke before you get a chance. That's a dick move. But to you that's OK because they are playing smart, bit hard. But you Cant get defence about they way they play. If I feel the need to blow up there camp. You should defend that as my right as a player. Jus as much as its there right as a player to put the camp there. No one wins. No ones better. Stop trying to force the narrative. I know what is dickish. And both party's are in this regard. If some one steps in front of you in combats and you hit them, you have passive mode off. Then they kill you is that a dick move? Is it right as a player to try and force that? or Its your fault for not being in passive? This is not a right/wrong topic of WS Turrets, this is a subjective arsehole question were there us wrong in both party's. 
---
Joseph Anderson had a 76 hours achievement at about 90-95 hours in-game. Can confirm "game can't count".
---
Video's titled 'The 1001 Glitches of Fallout 76' and is the last one in the huge list with examples. Timestamp for it is around 2:52:00. 
---
They should always drop loot corresponding to the number of stars they have, I think. 
---
You need them equipped for them to be active. But to be honest, at lvl 307 i run around in lvl 45 raider power armor as with the "fix it good" and "power patcher" and "super duper" perks equipped when repairing them, it basically costs 2 screws and some steel to repair and is hard wearing enough (at 200% cnd) that i can, quite happily, steam roll around West Virginia and not worry about it getting smashed to buggery. The other armor sets are nice and ive got x01 t51 excavator and ultracite sets, but with the cost of repair being way higher than the raider variant and being able to make up the damage resistance between the sets with perks etc, it just makes sense to use the raider set. I use the x01 or ultracite for queen fights but thats about it really. Hope this helps. Btw you can usually find a full set of raider power armor by the missile hatch of alpha, east of harpers ferry before you get to top of the world area üëç
---
I 10000% agree - I use X-01 only and none paintjob looks equally cool as that one (and I tried default, Prototype, Patriot, Tricentennial and my friend has Camo). Please, even if it'll cost 4k atoms I want it badly!!
---
The caesar has marked  you for death, and the legion obeys!
---
I think it's about a 20 minute delay, something like that. Still, not perfect for farming, you've gotta have some time free.
---
You can give it a rest with the "18$ skins" argument.
---
You can earn roughly 1000 Atoms a week, which stacks with the Atoms you pay for.  
---
Therefore you can easily earn plenty of Atoms and just supplement a little with paid currency.
---
At most if you're going after an "$18 skin" you would be paying just $2-6 if you do all your weeklies and dailies for a week.  
---
If it was about greed, you'd never be able to earn ANY Atoms for free.  
---
Server maint isn't the only thing MTX pay for, they pay for the Devs to keep working on the game as well, giving them their weekly paycheck so they can keep working on patches and new content.  
---
We've already been promised all future DLC will be free thanks to the MTX as well.  
---
The Creation Club is an entirely different thing all together, the Creation Club is about paying Modders and getting money directly into their hands.  
---
The Creation Club also can not exist without free modding such as on the Nexus where modders build a reputation before being asked to work on a CC Mod for an upfront commission.
---
When in regular ADS, both always hit, and the damage is calculated as a single, simultaneous 125% hit. When hipfired and only one projectile hits, it counts as a single 62.5% damage hit. It never does 100+25.
---
Also, the math for your Handmade is incorrect. You're supposed to multiply the 185 by .64 rather than divide by .36, because the Queen now has only .64 of her resist with Tank Killer.
---
You dirty, dirty wastelander.
---
can't promise that. I'd love if you tried though, it's the only reason why I'm still up.
---
I read through the whole thing and what I gathered is that you're under the impression you're factually right. in my opinion that's not the proper way to start a conversation. for example, I'm still more than willing to concede that I'm wrong. my only interest here is to learn. except you haven't presented enough evidence as to why I'm wrong. but are you willing to do the same?
---
because, to me, Bethesda's performance so far more than warrants the hate. this also seems to be the status quo. except for you. you seem to have this whole perspective that proves the vocal majority wrong.
---
but I haven't heard it yet. nothing you said so far convinced me that I shouldn't be so jaded.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Technically it is a cosmetic. The temporary health buff could also be received by a outfit already in the game for no cost. And it only lasted 2 weeks. Also, the game gives you the currency needed to buy atom shop items. This YouTuber is hunting for misinformed people that just wanna get angry so he can make money off your views. And he got ya good. 
---
Just battled the sbq with a group of 8-10 unknowns and it was a fight but definitely not impossible. Was my first sbq too. Agree everyone has to pull their weight.
---
That was the advertising for the production model. We only build a prototype.
---
üòÇüòÇ the mental picture that conjures for me is hilarious. A frothing, slobbering infectious adversary positively drizzling noxious saliva and mucus as the flail away at you üòÇ
---
I'm currently using the X-01. Here's a link to my build if you can help me with feedback. I'm going for a Bloodied build, so like mutations, protocol mod, etc.

---
Yes, the handmade calculation was wrong, and also irrelevant to the topic so I edited it out. Are you sure you get one bullet with ADS? I had a really bad accuracy 2-shot pistol that when ADS, the wall had two bullet impact 5-6 inches apart.
---
Seen him about 8 times, killed him 5. He ran away the other 3 times...
---
Typically the players that own those camps aren't even nearby so they don't get xp anyway.
---
Yeah, players will easily have twice the DR/ER of what you've listed here, though one advantage of Two Shot in PVP is that you would double your chance to proc status effects, like Staggering.
---
It still shoots as 2 projectiles, but ADS makes it so that they always either both hit or miss. And this damage is never consecutive, as in it does 1 hit at a time to the target; they simply count it as a 125% hit.
---
I cant even get the Monster Mash to trigger anymore. It used to start when I changed server and entered the school. Now it doesnt seems to start ever.    
---
Whats the new trick? 
---
it might've been the rad woms bug, but my BE .50cal stabilized at 240 damage (have just 1 of each heavy gunner card) at 20% HP.
---
I just tested it (managed to get it working by getting rid of all my mutations and drinking the serum) and now it's 280 at 20% and goes even higher at 10%.
---
so definitely an improvement on my side. but I didn't play around with it much prior to the rad worms bug.
---
Yeah, I edited my posts once you reminded me of that to mention that this is only for PvE. Your comment is also why shotguns are so good in PvP.
---
Warren ain‚Äôt native 
---
Oh awesome mate! Thank you so much. Really glad I could provide you content over the years :) 
---
Are they? Can you qoute the specific part of the tos that says that?
---
Thank you
---
Ohh interesting thank you 
---
Feels.
---
I wrote to Bethesda for this paint. It's so sad that we can't buy it anymore because maybe you too started playing later than others. And this paint is badass... i want it so bad. Hope they will help us
---
Very good very good indeed, then I think I will buy it
---
Have seen and will report back to the team. Thank you so much for letting us know mate
---
it worked for me, somewhat. at first both the suppression and the effect showed in the pipboy correctly. it was also increasing my damage.
---
then I logged out. now the suppression still showed but the effect was nowhere to be seen. oddly enough it was still increasing my damage.
---
logged out again and waited for suppression to pass. now the effect showed only the total HP loss but not the damage increase, except my weapons were still being affected by it.
---
logged out and back in one last time. effect shows but still missing information, damage increase still works. for now.
---
Faction share caps. So a raider vendors will have 200 between them and the responders bots have 200 between them. Always been that way
---
Unless I've miss understood what you are asking 
---
Always used diluted first, then normal, then super, ime 
---
Honestly i would not build yourself into a corner and leave yourself vulnerable to certain types of attack/damage . Flexibility is the best thing to be imo. When you get god tier legendaries then you can build around them. I have made my character so i can switch a few perks around and basically be ready for all kinds of situations. 
---
1-10 Do the quests/events
---
11-20 WV Lumber Co. (Take Tyler County Dirt Track every server swap)
---
21-30 Grafton Steel Yard (Clear and capture the workshop then server swap)
---
31-40 Huntersville
---
41-50 West-Tek
---
Every day I'm more grateful that I refunded my preorder. The way I've historically grinded in fallout games and I'd be in the same boat as you OP. I'm real sorry that Bethesda seems to be incapable of a proper game currently, I have high hopes that Rage 2 isnt disappointing.
---
Ah ok, thanks. For some reason I thought that each vendor had a separate cap limit.
---
Do a Google search for 'fo76 vendor map' there's a map with location and factions.
---
Caps are shared between factions.  All responder vendors share the 200 caps. Then raiders have their own 200 to share.
---
Then the single vendors Watoga, BOS, Enclave, Free States and Whitesprings each with it's own 200 caps pool.
---
And of course Graham and I believe there's a random vendor bot also.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Yep, i started playing in 2019.
---
Now i love the game so bad and i want everything, every projects, im a collector in irl too.
---
Cheers, thought it must be me as the subreddit wasn't screaming that it was broken :)
---
Thanks
---
I had that issue yesterday, but I use few mods (proper 21:9, silent camp, clean brick walls) - after adding one line to dustom ini file it's alll good now - every item from AS looks ok.
---
Vault-Tec makes sense lorewise though
---
Raider, responders, graham, free state, BOS, Enclave. Think that's everyone you can sell to. Might of missed one.
---
I saw him twice yesterday, I don't mind seeing our holy and marvellous mothman more but he seriously came at the most in-opportunist of times.
---
First in the mire near firebase major, I was surrounded by a small army of gulpers, then 3 vertibirds came, scorch, a scorchbeast and then a vengeful mothman.
---
Second about a hour later near west-tec, surrounded by a crap ton of high level super mutants, another vengeful mothman decided to grace his presence and for the sake of it 2 scorch beasts decided to appear just for shits and giggles. High tailed it outa there only to be chased by them all then faced with ghouls and mole miners as I was heading to whitesprings with the whole menagerie of creatures

If you actually read the thread you‚Äôd know I don‚Äôt PvP often and I didn‚Äôt initiate it. Nice try though you little wet wipe 
---
Strange thing is I use both vendors daily and they don't share caps limits - Sutton one is Raider's, while Charleston is Responder's. Done my usual vendor run after patch and everything was all right. Are 100% sure you checked the right vendors?
---
it worked for me, somewhat. I removed all my mutations (with radaway), unequipped all my perks (including starched genes), armor and weapons and relogged into the game. took the serum.
---
at first both the suppression and the effect showed in the pipboy correctly. it was also increasing my damage.
---
then I logged out. the suppression still showed but the effect was gone from the pipboy. oddly enough it was still increasing my damage.
---
logged out again and waited for suppression to pass. now the effect showed the HP loss but not the damage increase, except my weapons were still being affected by it.
---
relogged one last time. effect shows in the pipboy but is still missing information, damage increase still works. for now.
---
just quit the launcher and tried again. still working.
---
Well you would want more object oriented instead like...
---
consumableMats items = characterInventory.ScrapNonBulk("
---
   "name": \[\[shortName\]\],
---
   "type": \[\[metaType\]\],
---
   "weight":\[\[itemWeight\]\],
---
   "bulk": \[\[itemBulked\]\],
---
}
---
So when you pull the data, you can query just the "type" and "bulk" filters so you are returning "junk" and "itemBulked" set to false.  Then you do not need the check for bulk.   Just zip through the collection and scrap.
---
on an unrelated note, I'll forgive this if you make them bring the blackbird paintjob back.
---
please.
---
Cringe
---
Thanks for the commentary brainlet.
---
Well damn that‚Äôs awesome then, thanks for the explanation
---
I‚Äôll jump on and see what you‚Äôve made and give some a go, cheers :)
---
Super mutants 
---
thanks for the info, i never noticed trust me. Maybe it was a pure coincidence because i usually sell diluteds, and yesterday i produced 100 diluted with my new super duper lvl 3 and chemical (dont know if translation is ok) cards. My bad then, sorry
---
Flat Dark Earth.  Please.
---
This happened to me trying to backpeddal out of the screech spam (trying to see an actual fucking anything). Lost like 4 hours of junk, but was my fault so I can hack it. 
---
I can fire a minigun on Xbox one and my framerate stays steady.  I'm happy as hell.
---
&gt; I haven't played the game in a week
---
So you haven't played since the latest patch.
---
No Bethesda has a long track recore of being accused of lying about this game, but NOONE actually showed a single such lie. Only bullcrap like "Well, I assumed that...", "This being announced as a multiplayer game should imply..." or "A released game should...".
---
No. Single. Lie. Period.
---
Compared to that, gamers that didn't want this game to exist (most of them FaNVboys) were caught again and again lying and willingly spreading misinformation about this game. So do you blame people for not believing gamers on the internet?
---
Sir that‚Äôs my emotional support supersledge.
---
The question that‚Äôs not being asked here is if said person is a melee build then why would he be spending all this time running around and farming ammo he can‚Äôt use?  I could see building up a stockpile for a different build but it makes 0 sense to spend 12hrs a day farming something you don‚Äôt use. 
---
Ive been saving would you say its worth it to grind 2k more?
---
still seems like a useless perk though
---
&gt; mostly due to the regressions they've had with old bugs coming back
---
There was, as far as we know, one regression with an old bug coming back.
---
All the other bugs are exciting new ones.
---
&gt; Arguing how the week we had a bonus from wearing one of the Unstoppables! 
---
Bethesda stated, cosmetic only, no stat altering stuff. And then came the Unstoppables! costumes and they broke their promise and added a stat modifer. That is what he points out. Bethesda did the opposite what they have said and you blame him!? I mean, whats fucking wrong with you? 
---
So, I‚Äôm trained in this. Got myself a masters in entrepreneurship, graduated circa 2012.
---
First thing they teach you is that what kills most projects (whether 2 guys in a garage or big Corp trying something new, doesn‚Äôt matter) Isn‚Äôt a shit product. In fact, customer forgive shit products all the time. 
---
What kills most projects is that they built the wrong thing, and by the time they realize it, there‚Äôs too little cash runway left to change course. 
---
So what they teach you is not to aim for perfect, but to drop the product in front of your users as early as you can humanely get away with it, and then start very aggressively using the feedback to drive the product. 
---
That has a **much** higher chance of inoculating you from death by building the wrong game than building the perfect thing. 
---
The big difference with these kinds of projects from, say, Skyrim or F4 style ones, is the aggressive continued development post launch. 
---
It‚Äôs like the difference between a 90‚Äôs feature phone and a modern smartphone. The former will never do more than it did the day you bought it. Fallout 4 never did more than it did at the start. DLC‚Äôs didn‚Äôt change much about the core world (ok, NW did a bit). They were all sidecar worlds. 
---
F76 will (hopefully like a modern smartphone) grow, and it isn‚Äôt just Todd  and friends steering it. We are.

---
You really think they reinstall the game?  Hell, I'm pretty sure none of them ever installed the game in the first place.
---
So a weapon that comes stock with 189% damage is worthless?  Its better than any other weapon in the entire game still.  That is without any perks/mutations/chems.  It just is 189% damage right away.
---
I got a Bloodied Explosive Pump Shotgun to drop last week for me when someone dropped a nuke on Whitespring, got pretty lucky. Didn't even know it was good, so I'm just building a build around that weapon. Like I'm trying to go for a close range shotgunner build who can pack a lot of damage while not dying instantly. That's why I have shotgun perks and power armor perks, hope that explains it. 
---
Yup, extremely fun, was on a trippel a month back, (xbox)  :D
---
Needed a cig after that, lol
---
Eat you alive, you better build church and pray at his statue.
---
Yup, meat hooks profit from unarmed and one handed perks
---
My buddy and I grinded out his first nuclear launch today, I started with about 700 5.56, about 400 shells, and 30 stimpacks. We make it through, and launch the nuke to fissure site prime, and attempt to do scorched Earth, no one was even attempting to attack her, except for me. About 15 minutes in, she does her regen, so I dip out, only to realize *I don't have any ammo, or stimpacks.*
---
Unfortunate
---
Yep it is same as last week you had +15hp for every guy in your group.
---
There are different kinds of mothman. You came across stalker one, he run away as you enter combat.
---
There are also agressive ones with red eyes and scroched agresive with green eyes.
---
WhiteSpring + Watoga.
---
This used to happen in Whitespring a lot back when the spawns were out of control.  Including the unkillable vendors who would drop dead then power back up again a moment later with a sliver of health and repeat the process.  These days, I see this mostly happening with robots in Watoga where they will come out of their spawners and then immediately die.  I figured it had to do with only so many AI able to be active at a given time for server performance but who knows.
---
 Priced this on the bridge, ghouls ‚Äúpop up‚Äù much closer since the patch,  but while near scenery does look better, distant scenery is not as sharp.
---
Which games have those rules? Sounds insane.
---
Staying up late writin drunk letters again, aren't ya, Jed.
---
Doing crazy damage seems like a fair trade when most enemies will outplay you with distance or even flying.
---
Melee is OP.  With a normal melee weapon and no melee perks in melee, I can kill stuff faster than using legendary weapons WITH several perks.
---
Killing stuff with 1 or 2 hits in melee is too much.  Needs to be 3-4 hits to make it on par with guns.  Guns already have penalty which is ammo.  Melee has penalty (kinda) with having to be in range.  But most stuff in game need to get close to you anyway or they come melee you.   Only difficult/annoying mob in game for pure melee build is SB/SBQ.  Thats it.
---
Sadly immortal / rapid healing enemies back.
---
I put 500 .50 rounds into gulper and would came back all healed in moments. 
---
But checking your inventory shows your other armor *sometimes* (even though you don't get its effects).
---
hey! team for queen?
---
Will check later, thanks
---
I wholeheartedly agree with everything you said. the problem is that I wouldn't qualify what Bethesda is doing as "aggressive". they've shown utter incompetence this past few months.
---
there are far better examples out there, games that did a whole lot more in three months. or, at the very least, they didn't break other things. they just broke a core mechanic for a popular build while fixing something they broke a patch ago (diseases, rad worms) which is seemingly irrelevant to every other fix.
---
Don't do it Bethesda! If you missed it TOO BAD! You dont deserve it :p lol
---
What bug was that?  I've got resistant lining on my vault suit and I've never had my PA frame disappear.
---
I had a similar bug back when I was constructing my X-01. 
---
I was sorting through my PA frames at camp, had 5 or 6 of them and was looking for the one that was empty. I placed the frames down and my various suits were attached, so the last frame should have been the spare one. It wouldn't place or drop in the world. Assuming it was lag or the server starting to play up, I tried logging, server hopping, restarting etc but it still didn't work.
---
In the end, I gave up in frustration and decided to just go and grab a new frame from one of the spawn points. When I scrapped the bugged frame, I suddenly went encumbered. I thought the bug had somehow applied to my character and broken it, but I then discovered a full set of Ultracite PA pieces in my inventory... despite the fact my UPA was sitting on the frame already deployed nearby. Don't know how or why it happened as I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary and I simply destroyed the pieces.
---
Twat.
---
I think I once repaired the pad and launched the vertibot and only later acquired the Workshop but not 100% sure
---
No one reported being taken out by a group of superheroes in PvP AND you can't wear them in nuke zones. Besides this old news, OP. It's funny you're getting slammed so hard in the comments but you're not replying to anything lol
---
Lol reminds me of a drunk texting to an ex
---
I am still disappointed. I didn't want to spend real money on a paintjob when I was sceptical about the game.
---
Now I wish I got it. 
---
To make this constructive.
---
There are a few things that, currently, make melee -- especially the AllRise build -- "broken" comparatively with the other builds available.
---
First of all, All Rise is stupid : it's a quest item so you have it automatically, it's 90% weight reduced so you don't have the issue of sacrificing carry weight, and it's the best weapon-type in the game as far as melee is concerned : a super sledge.
---
Now, why is a super sledge the best weapon ? Because of how damage reduction works. That's a whole topic that should be adressed, some people have done the calculations better than I could, but basically : armors reduces a fix amount of damage from each "hit". Hence, the less hit you have to do for a given total damage, the less reduction will be applied... 
---
But that issue also concerns every range weapon, and is the reason a shotgun is better than a sniper, if you don't consider sneak, range etc.
---
The second issue is that melee benefits from strength. If I remember correctly, it's something around 5% damage bonus per strength point. That means a player with 10 in strength has 50% damage bonus. That's plain stupid, and totally unfair to other builds. Why isn't a sniper-build's damage changed by perception? Energy and intel ? Heavy weapons and say endurance ? 
---
This is even more "unfair" due to most of the melee perks being directly related to strength. Explosive perks are distributed between perception, intel, strength and luck. Shotguns perks are in strength and agi. But blocker, gladiator, etc are mostly in strength. "Easier" to build.
---
The last issue is that melee weapons don't need ammunitions. That sounds obvious, but in a game where you have to grind that much, it's incredibly easier to carry two super sledges than to worry about having enough ammos. I have a shotgun build, and ammunitions are eaten super fast. I've another character who isn't even melee builded, and I one/two shot mutants with a basic super sledge. No ammo issue. 
---
Some of you will say "yes, doctorPrisme, but a hammer doesn't need ammo, that's normal". Yeah. Have you looked at the super sledge ? That shit is powered by a rocket. It could use fusion cores, fusion cells, fuel, oil, whatever. But they chose that it doesn't have to. 
---
Same goes for the power fist, the chainsaw or others. That shit doesn't just magically work. Or at least shouldn't.
---
Now, I have heard the argument "but we are at closer range, our armours are more often destroyed, that's another ressource-eater you range builds don't have.
---
First, that's a lie. There's the Blocker Perk, there's the right click on your mouse to block attacks, there's the "unstoppable train" perk while in PA, all this makes a "decent" melee build able to one-shot 90% of the ennemies without getting hit, don't mention getting your armor damaged. (I haven't run empirical tests on those to check in detail, feel free to prove me wrong).
---
Secondly, aside from low level ennemies, most of the ennemies met have ranged weapons, and shoots as much on melee builds than on ranged builds. So that argument isn't really valid. 
---
I don't mind players wanting to use a super-sledge to bash skulls. What I do mind is that those players have it easier AND are more efficient than other builds. I understand that having your head crushed by a 120pounds-steelbar hurts a fuckin'lot. I also believes being in the radius of a miniaturized nuclear bomb should prove at least as deadly. I also think that being under the assault of a plasma gatling should be as deadly. I am pretty sure taking a shotgun shot full face at close range should prove not only as deadly but way more dirty.
---
And that's what I want to see change. I don't ask for Melee to be nerfed. I ask for a balance between the damages and quality of life of melee and those of the other weapons.
---
Currently, energy weapons are in a pit, but it "should change" ~~SoonTM~~ (sorry wrong studio). Explosive and heavy weapons are laughable because of the scarcity of their munitions, their weight and the improbable way they do damage. Pistols are so lame there's actually no stats concerning them because no one gave enough fucks to try. Shotguns are decent, but the lack of range and the fact their munitions requires plastic makes it a pain in the ass compared to melee. Which leaves sneaky builds, because there's actually a sneak-bonus + critical damage bonus that makes it viable; otherwise it would also be ignored.
---
Thoughts ?
---
Change the way damages are applied. A big hit of 10 damages should not be more efficient than ten small hits of one damage each.
---
Change the perk distribution so that players can't just max strength. Or so that other builds don't have to take a bit of everything without the ability to max in the same way.
---
Change the bonus related to strength so that melee damage aren't directly related to strenght. Or so that other builds are also related to their perk. 
---
Seems like a solid and simple situation, having a test server process. Fuckit, have my upvote.
---
No, just no. Obtaining Atoms is too easy, but thanks to limited time sales these skins are somewhat valuable. They should wait atleast year till bringing it back to sale, otherwise what the point of having limited sale if it is going to be back on sale so soon.
---
Ahh shit i probably should have specified, yes I do know the cable that comes standard with the nose qc 35 is just a standard one with no mic as the mic is actually built into the headphones themself. Have had to buy maybe 4 nose qc 25 cables whilst using them but still no luck. This is the most helpful anyone has been though so I greatly appricate you mr noodleparty :) thank you
---
In my experience is always like this unless you have some rapport with a CM that can speed up things for you.
---
Otherwise waiting between 3 days and a week for the first copy&amp;paste reply is business as usual.
---
If you have actual issues that you may want to see at least acknowledged I recommend contacting a CM and bombarding them with properly formatted and courteous tickets until you make a manager cross.
---
I saw him twice today. Never before thoose two times.
---
Bethesda made some internal changes that broke how Text Chat and Perk Loadout Manager work behind the scenes.  So it'll be a while before those mods come back.
---
Come check it out, since you already own it!
---
And does OP dispute that? He admits 
---
&gt;The game is a shit show
---
I am waiting for a video on why is reddit hating on me 
---
WTF is "opps"? WTF is "Watagoa"?
---
OP does not deny that. He explicitly writes that the game is a shit show. 
---
You don‚Äôt have the means to assess how much effort is required for each release. Your opinion on what does qualify as competent or incompetent is uninformed. 
---
Do you know how much budget Todd has? 
---
How many devs are on the team? 
---
How they divide those resources between bugs and new stuff? 
---
How they divide those resources between f76 and f5? 
---
How long it takes the automated test harnesses run, and how long it takes the human testing to run? 
---
How the inherited code hangs together (remembering there‚Äôs code here that dates back many titles, these games are generationally layered one on top of the other for the game system complexity, you‚Äôd have a much smaller game if we weren‚Äôt getting freebie assets from past titles, but that always comes with technical debt), and how you manage unexpected ways in which X causes some completely unrelated Y? 
---
You know none of this. 
---
What we‚Äôre seeing could be the product of utter incompetence, or it could be the product of a small group of hard working people bending the laws of space and time in some heroic effort to get this thing to start and make us all want to play more of it. Most likely, something in between. 
---
But, when we don‚Äôt have data to feed into our equation, we don‚Äôt make it up to tell the story we want to tell. We admit ignorance and let people have some benefit of the doubt.
---
There‚Äôs a lot to be desired and even more that just needs a bit of TLC and fixing, but there also **is** a lot right with this game. 
---
I do want to be playing it. They built the right product, and, despite the two steps forward one step back, it is growing. 
---
Is that not different from what you're doing? Balance is subjective. Melee has inherent risks tied with it. Go ahead and sword that deathclaw outside your power armor. See what happens when you're using a regular plain sledge and not Instagatorizor-3000. 
---
Do that same fight with a gun. Which goes better? I leveled as melee because I knew heavy guns and their ammo were fubar. That was my primary leveling choice and I had to always have a melee weapon because I couldn't take any rifle perks. Ranged weapons are superior to melee ones. This isn't being contested. 
---
There should be a payoff for the additional requirement of having to manage your health bar in addition to your ammo counter. The reward? Higher damage. Of course, there are other ways of going about it too. Sneaky stealth build vs. grognak the barbarian. 
---
A side effect of current implementation is bullet sponges. Do you enjoy putting 60 .50 rounds into a **ghoul** to kill it? Have you seen a .50 round? It shouldn't take more than 3. 
---
But no, can't have that.
---
Container contents are (usually?  always?) per character instanced.
---
A lot better - all my stuff is still here wooohooo!
---
And boom you have games like stalker and wasteland and arma. 
---
Yes. absolutely. There's a reason I picked the .50 MG. it saddens me to see the state of the MG42. It shouldn't take 60 .308 rounds to kill something. 
---
Same bullet the hunting rifle uses. It's stupid. One does less because there's more of them. 
---
i dont have to provide shit, he was duping, fact, case closed. 
---
Attitudes like this are exactly what killed Fallout in the first place

In his original post, the 12k upvoted one he said bethesda might have just gotten the total amt from trade. 
---
Meaning if i drop 10k ammo for another guy to pick it up and he drops it again for u to pick it up  both of u might get banned because the bethesda's item counting system doesnt recognise when u drop items and only counts when u pick it up. 
---
Its all explained in his post if u read it. 
---
So much bullshit that you included a link to help him make money.
---
So far, my experience with this perk is it works well with combat shotgun, even better with double barrel...... utterly useless with mini gun,laser gatling,plasma gatling,gatling,50 Cal..... haven't tried rifles...I can farm mole miners for several hours with this perk and a combat shotgun without having to repair
---
Lol, so true.

I never thought about it, but yeah I havent come across one laser/plasma user.

Ahhh! I should name it Betsi my dear love. Maybe next time... :D

That's a great adventure! I would have forgotten to get the snapshot ü§£

(You might know it already, but taking your weapon out when landing cancels the smash animation)
---
Ahh yeah that one I know thats where I've got most of my armour plans. Not seen any deep pocketed there though.
---
In all seriousness, didn't they remove those from the game as well? (As in, they don't spawn anymore?) 
---
Many have asked, few cared on the other side it seems. Good luck 
---
Have fun doing doing free QC for Beth, I'll be waiting for them to use your efforts to actually finish this game.

They are cosmetic only. It was just an event, and the outfits didn't give any advantages except for when the event was active.

If you craft or collect your food/drink in decent amounts, just add it to your quick select radial menu.  Seriously, I don‚Äôt get how people still eat the old fashioned ‚ÄòWait!  Let me eat!‚Äô method.

when using alt-tab you can see where fallout is on the list in task manager(for me it‚Äôs always at the top), so when I have task manager selected I press the down arrow(on the keyboard) then delete. If you aren‚Äôt sure you have fallout selected you can use alt-tab again to check what you have selected in the task manager.
---
You're obviusly stoopid.
---
The frame would randomly disappear so you could never exit your PA. Someone else posted a thread about it a while ago and said the solution was to un-equip your lined underamor. I un-equipped it and it stopped disappearing, so I assumed that was the cause.
---
But now you are
---
Yes he does. He calls it a 'non-controversy' and describes the 'claim' as 'ridiculous'. It is not a claim, it is a fact. Your reading comprehension is lacking.
---
He didn\`t used exploits. He just given ammo from 1 of his chars to another his char. And the moment his lvl1-2 char dumped 30k ammo into chest. he got autoban.
---
Problem is i think system is set to auto delete account. Instead of autoban.
---
And now devs is prob ignoring him. In hope of r\*tarded funbois bulling him out of the game
---
cfchan17. Whats urs?
---
Specifically, I remember some complaints about TSE being able to wipe out entire mobs in seconds, and no one else in the vicinity would be able to tag anything. It was also considered a way of griefing. Heck, even without the 100% damage multiplier I had a guy with a TSE do that to me last night during the Wild Night event. 
---
Also, I used TSE as a melee spec character. It‚Äôs weird that you‚Äôd say you have to fully spec into any firearms in order to fully use any TSE weapon. The damage was so high I could one shot myself(oops) or any player I came across without a single perk outside melee or weight carry.

eeeeh, nah ? Please.

Bacterias just jump of enemy's blood on your weapon right into your bloodstream.
---
I don't think you really understand the demographics behind the players. I'd say only about 10% of players enagage in PvP on a regular basis. Starting asking people on these subs, and especially actually in-game, and you'll see that most people focus on PvE.
---
Also, PvE is not a factor? üòÇ Dude, try comparing a 3* max modded, max perk weapon to one that has none of that. Yeah, you'll see that these things actually *do* matter in PvE.

What do you mean stealth is broken, I go deal some sweat sneak damage on MELEE on super mutants like they're made from cardboards boxes lmao

Right. Cool story bro. I mean, "mang." Carry on, shitbag.

Cranky because you got a ban aren't you

Wait till the other person has loaded in the area to fast travel there.

You need to get the salt out, man

lol what? You either have mental issues, or are intoxicated. Either way, not worth my time. Peace out, shitbag who can't spell.
---
It's been butter smooth today for me. 
---
Yeah so this is the perfect example to why these bans are hardly ever lifted. Great it's always good if there is one less cheater out there.
---
its limited for being free once that time is up you will no longer have the pose remember bethesda can not be trusted with what they say 
---
How the fuck do they managed to mix purified water and bobbleheads ?  
---
I understand the amount of work you have to put in the code base of something like Fallout, but there are some issues I can definitely not understand.  
---
Ah, Bethesda, always the best bugs.  Never seen this one myself, but I don't tend to spend much time in PA, just for fast traveling when overloaded and SB fights.
---
No wait. Re add them but not before you make them available to excavator and ultracite too.
---
&gt; Have fun
---
I certainly will.
---
You're still a twat though.
---
Must have been a slow overblown outrage day to post something so old.
---
&gt;Also, PvE is not a factor? üòÇ Dude, try comparing a 3* max modded, max perk weapon to one that has none of that. Yeah, you'll see that these things actually do matter in PvE.
---
only 8% of players killed the scorched beast queen  and only 6% or so got to level 50 (this was posted on this sub)  making so that the player base that uses tse only at end game . meaning the tse weapons ware fine since it didnt disrrupet the balance for the rest of the players in the game. and we are talking about pve . you know bots with little to no ai or challenge  .. there is no competition or anything .
---
and yes i am aware most of the fallout 76 base is casual .. they shouldnt be heard in the first place. specially pve players when it comes to balance of the game.

you get detected easier since last months patch. it's a confirmed bug.

You're wrong on the "breaking even" part.

You could have 100 down votes to 30 upvotes and it'd still show as zero...

Now YTA

That's not the only thing broken from last patch.

Give it time. I'm sure it'll be EVENTUALLY resolved. Hopefully.

Technically swimming is safe from diseases, it's when you're diving that you're risking diseases (more likely once your head is under the water level)

yeah neither of those things were said but whatever

Bethesda kills a mod. They care a lot about that. They're truly sorry.
---
Then go play Skyrim. No one is asking you to play. No one is wanting to to play and no one is compelling you to play. Frankly no one cares. 
---
The game is enjoyable for some the game is not enjoyable for others. If you do not enjoy the game then why are you here? Go...find something you enjoy.
---
Would be a bit to much asking for, wouldn't it?
---
Oh I'm sorry professor, I thought we were being sarcastic. 
---
It always works perfectly for me (aside from queen despawning before loot loads) when I'm on a team. Whenever I join the event solo I burn through 300-500 rounds and disconnect from server.
---
Also digested goo needs adding to that list, spent half hour the other day collecting some for making Overdrive and accidentally scrap it all :(
---
I have never experienced this. You do know that if you sneak your bubble is not on the map right?
---
I have had zero issues
---
I was invisible when switching weapon, no chameleon gear or mutations.

Downvoted huh? Unbelievable

honestly, i tried to love this game. I really did, but it's not a complete game. it was clearly rushed. there is still so much to do with it and im sure later, it might be awesome. However, i dont want to play a game where i have to use a VPN to protect my IP address and deal with glitches that really shouldnt have been in the release to begin with. All i want is my 60 dollars back and maybe, JUST MAYBE, once they get their shit together, ill consider getting the game again. for now im calling up my bank.
---
That's just one of hundreds. Stop paying attention to these kind of posts. Silently downvote and move on!
---
These are the only options currently. I do recommend doing the awol armaments event every time you see it as there is a guaranteed 3\* in the last wave every time. I've gotten my best drops from this event.  
---
They changed the graphics. Things render further
---
It's a down vote bot. Everything gets down voted here because people don't like you talking about this game. Salty mofos.
---
No XP for turret kills so I don't know what leveling people think they're getting... I never wee anyone around when turrets are ganking mobs 90% of the time so it's not like they're tagging.
---
Fuck them.
---
They should Hazmat suit into WS nuke zone, sit on that wall and tag glowing ones for big XP as a low level... 
---
And this twat won't work for free. I will enjoy playing this game once they finish making it, so keep up the good work üëç.
---
I comment because of new players or interested potential players that may come here and think that the very vocal super minority that cries about this game are a larger representation than what they actually are. Shit posts like this can and have given the wrong impression about the game.
---
I agree with your second comment and respectfully disagree with your first. Again I would ask you not to project your play style onto other people. I detailed how simple it would be to collect all this ammo and more in that time frame especially as an active member of this subreddit who trades and thus has access to mass quantities of resources without having to farm them.  Like I said previously I collect at least 8k rounds a day so just be aware that how you play the game can differ greatly from other people with more free time. 
---
Anyways at this point there‚Äôs not much to argue about, BSG banned this player and sent him an email stating it was because of his mass quantities of ammo.. I detailed how collecting this much ammo is both profitable and sensible if you‚Äôre a trader. Unless BSG or the OP are not revealing part of the truth then I believe this to be a case of failed algorithm. 
---
I understand what you‚Äôre saying about not believing everything on the internet, however I refuse to live life skeptical of everyone and everything so I‚Äôll base my opinions on the facts at hand and if new facts come to light then I‚Äôll re-asses. Notice I‚Äôm not really criticizing BSG just pointing out how easy it would be to get caught up in this ban as a hardcore player and informing the people who say it‚Äôs impossible to craft that much ultracite ammo in 30 days. Not only is it possible but sensible in a game such as this.
---

*Wise Mothman disliked that.*
---
Did you have a specific issue or did you just ant to rant?
---
you were? i thought you were disagreeing with me, good to know that you werent.
---
Aye, but a downvote does that more  effectively. If he got traction and some upvotes, then participate. By responding first, you enable the post.
---
The white knights in this board are a cancer.
---
I‚Äôve seen you. You are the guy who posts YouTube videos he disagrees with and invited others to brigade them.
---
Might be that.
---
Yeah its nonsense. For a couple of days it's quite positive here and constructive but then Bethesda  balance something and people start throwing their shit at the walls and calling people fanboys if they don't agree Bethesda is EA. Then it evens out for a couple of days. Cycles and repeats.
---
Remember when two shot and explosive was reduced damage? They are debatedly still the best weapons ffs but that was just loads of "I'm done" posts here.
---
Maybe they stopped playing.
---
AR is bugged: the negative effect is working, but not the positive. The first hour after you take a serum all negative mutation effects are suppressed, which is why AR is not showing up in the list with the others.
---
Hopefully, they will fix this soon. 
---
Oh yeah forgot about events. I never "chase" these but the 3 I will always do and only these: AWOL Armaments (sometimes there's a second legendary) Scorched Earth (if I happen to log onto a server and see someone in a silo or see it active on the map) and Horde events (depending on which type and only if it's in the Cranberry Bog)
---
They were pretty clear that their issue was the lack of a test server for upcoming patches
---
Actually naive enough to believe you can afford it with the piss trickle of atoms you get at endgame...
---
It‚Äôs half the reason I don‚Äôt go on the filthy casuals sub. Non stop crying about people who don‚Äôt like the game. 
---
Did you even read the post?
---
Just added a new guide on Mutations!

Why give his videos any life by providing a link to his video? It just feeds his channel.
---
They're not guaranteed to be lvl 50 spawns but I've actually gotten stuff I could sell out of it. But once I did get a 35 off of a Super Mutant Horde, the boss was a 42 instead of 68. It happens sometimes, that's why I said you gotta make sure of the type
---
I would like to point out this is like the 5th i hate yongyea post i have seen today
---
that makes sense somehow, it's a lot more valuable if nobody can buy it anymore. So lucky the guys which bought it back then. But why coming out with such a nice paint so close to release date? I started playing in late december because ive been really busy with my second job, with crazy shift. So i lost a bit more than a month, if im not mistaking. you know how many got the game as a christmas gift and started playing later? It's not my case cos im a 34 yo, but I think about young players too... 
---
It would be nice from them to bring it back available and give us too a chance, but... for a limited time only!!! :D
---
RNG strikes again.  
---
Yeah and there‚Äôs always a link to the video and you and others slagging him off.  That‚Äôs brigading.
---
I‚Äôve seen you and others commenting why are you genuinely trying to AstroTurf the sub as if YouTubers are responsible for the reception of this game like it‚Äôs a conspiracy?
---
Are you really this in love with bethesda to go as far as to defend them online like this?
---
After 2 months of playing and multiple patches , I learned something:
---
SCRAP MANUALLY ALWAYS
---
I view this like instigating drills ... yes usage (VATs or no) is important but also the chassis. A low damage weapon gets more benefit (like autofire weapons) as the TS won't bump the damage enough to overshoot the AA gain. 
---
In general though yeah ... my TS weapons still outperform. AA comes out on the big armored things.
---
Oh and I still want a 40k bolt pistol, so will still look for an AAE 10mm, but that's all for silly points.
---
Ok thx for clearing that up. Funny how bad bethesda is with updates
---
Yongyea, is that you?
---
Buy a ps4 and I can give you a ton lol
---
Just go back to r/fallout you clearly don't like this game and think new vegas is the end all be all of fallout games when it's not
---
It‚Äôs possible the time ran out on the Scorched Earth event, you only have about 30 minutes to kill her before she flies away as you stated.. prob trynna meet up with the Scorchbeast king  in glass caverns ;)
---
When you plug raw damage of 1 into the equation, TS is still better against the Queen.
---
My whole post was dedicated to TS being better against *every enemy*, even the best armor, the Queen. So no, TS is always better in PvE, regardless of armor.
---
Thanks for the PSA! Mothman is my fave and I haven‚Äôt been on in a while 
---
Sure I do. Nice strawman you got yourself there buddy!
---
Bolstering goes up to 35 at 20% same as unyielding +3. Not sure what correlation you are referring. But I guess I understand the agenda here. 
---
I actually did a horde event in the uncanny caverns. Killed a lvl 9 feral ghoul and got a lvl 50 armor it was weird 
---
You've always been able to harvest any crops without a bounty lel.
---
Cutting things open is often messy. Blood splatter into your mucous membranes is the most common vector for blood borne disease. This is why you should only go zombie hunting with polearms
---
What about magazines and bobble heads. They would t fit the above categories?
---
Is there meant to be a fo5?
---
Mhm very nice buddy just scream in the void
---
Not a gatling laser either. You can clearly see two red lines per shot fired, sometimes quite far apart. That's while aiming through the sight... 
---
That's nice dear.
---
The correlation is that percentages of the boost for Bolstering go up at the same rate as percentages for Adrenal Reaction.
---
At 20% HP, they both give their full boost (+50% dmg, 35/35 resist)
---
At 50% HP, they both give half of their boost (+25% dmg, 18/18 resist)
---
And so on. There's no agenda here?... I'm just telling you the numbers behind certain effects.
---
I‚Äôll just have to do like I did with hardened mass before the patch, drop the royal jelly then scrap all and pick it back up and hope it doesn‚Äôt fall through the map.. cause ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that manual scrap bruh only so many times you can smash that A button until it breaks 
---
Yes, I'm not talking visually. You can test it yourself.
---
Shoot an enemy with TS ADS, and even if you see a stray projectile, it still does the full damage if you look at the HP bar. Then, do hipfire and land one projectile and see the different in HP reduction.
---
First of all, I play melee, started with guns, like everyone, but found that replenishing ammo sucks big time, so I changed to melee (unarmed to be exact).
---
I agree that melee can get a vast amount of damage per hit with the right combination of RARE ITEMS, LOTS OF PERKS and SKILL, cause you need a very specific weapon (I still haven't found in 267+ hours of play and several nuke zone runs) and also a "not very safe" combination of perks, mutations and chems, with the addition of LOW HP.
---
But I really REALLY hope that if devs decide to do something about that in the future, they apply the nerfs to the perks, not the weapons, cause being a melee player I've never used the low health build (I find it troublesome but also very boring) and if suddenly, the melee weapons do something like half their base damage, then they would really be rendered useless, unless you adapt your playstyle and start using said perks. 
---
That would be annoying for me, but I could roll with it, casual players surely won't. 
---
Sacrificing the weight reduction perks, or maybe the durability extension ones would be too much to afford for many players.
---
In short, with the right combination (not easy at all to acquire) you can get 2k+ a hit, but then you get shot by a rad rifle and poof, dead. Obviously cause it reaches you from afar, wich you do not.
---
TSEs were high damage, high range, high area and ignoring PVP rules too. Melee is brutal (wich is melee's trademark in any game) and can be broken if you take it TO THE LIMIT.
---
TLDR: Melee itself is not OP nor broken. Please don't ask for melee nerf, study the real problem and make an educated suggestion instead.
---
I'm pretty sure a bounty was put on your head if you stole from others, but ok. What a shitty idea not to be flagged in the first place then.
---
What you just said literally makes no fucking sense. Think about this.... The extra characters slots are there to be used if the player wants. They have a designated weight limit. This limit is there for players to use to the max, if they want.  
---
If they didnt want players to make extra characters and use them why in the hell would there be extra slots? And if they didnt intend or anticipate for players  to use characters as a personal bank ,why in the hell would they have set the limit 1.5k over max carry.  
---
Come on man, think. Most every single MMO allows for mules. Thats the rule not the exception.
---
I usually just throw up the heart emoji and quietly back away and hope for the best 
---
Not able to turn off all of teammates missions on my screen, only some of them.  This can take up alot of space if folks don't want to turn off their missions.  Also, what is the thought on bigger teams in the future?

It's fucking fruit dude calm down its all over the map

Will try it out when I get a chance :)

Hey are you on XB1? I‚Äôve got some lower level legendaries you can have 
---
At times I played with my wife, her brother and a friend. I could count the times when all four of us could see all the other three on one hand. We all had that bug, constantly. This had nothing to do with sneaking or something, it of course mostly appeared when we ported, and to different degrees. We sometimes saw no sign of the other person, sometimes we could see them on the map at least, and every now and then we would have a floating name tag to work with. But it was happening all the time, and our gameplay was dominated by figuring out if everyone was there and ready for the next action. We could even see other people's maniputions on the map like blowing up cars or placing structures. But someone was always invisible. 
---
I‚Äôm not the one upset some youtubers doesn‚Äôt like my game enough that I go and try gather mates to brigade them. 
---
Who‚Äôs really screaming here man? 
---
What about it? The guy guy were talking about didn't have any multiples of the same TSE gun. 
---
How about just a sort category for each of those. Tap q a few times and only see what you want.
---
i see the white knights still exist in defensive of a shit product rofl. i will thx, have fun getting banned from picking up a weapon dupe that some cheater spawned in. XD
---
should i know that person? or you just meming?
---
Unless you want to involve in PVP accidentally or not, you should be a pacifist. 
---
Otherwise you will get smashed , by that guy or some other in the end.
---
At first, I was up in arms about the dupers and cheaters. I blamed them for the server crashes, the lack of economy, and much more.
---
Months later, game performance is a bit better. Population seemed to be a down a bit, but seemed to indicate that most cheaters had gotten bored and left. However, duping was still a thing!! They removed duped items‚Äîcool! Then they suspend people who have in the past.
---
While I never cheated or reaped the benefits of others cheating, I have to ask myself at what point does the blame shift from the player to the dev team? I‚Äôve played MMOs for years. Exploits typically occur in a swift chain of events - exploit discovered &gt; exploit fixed &gt; exploiters banned. I feel like these exploits weren‚Äôt handled quick enough, and they suspended people too late in the game for it to matter. 
---
I‚Äôm glad they only suspended people, but honestly, it seems odd to take action now when deleting the files items and patching the exploits would have done the same thing. On the other hand, not playing with cheaters is nice. Somehow though, this situation feels weird.
---
It seems most likely
---
I heard the new PvE dlc is going to have a lot of mirelurks tho so it could be viable for that. 
---
Go to "Documents&gt;My Games&gt;Fallout 76"
---
Open Fallout76Custom.ini
---
Find :
---
\[Archive\]
---
sResourceArchive2List = 
---
Remove the name of the mod files on that line, for example "BetterInventory.ba2"
---
If you can't find this in that file (Fallout76Custom.ini) check the other .ini files.
---
Also go to your Fallout 76 install folder, go into the "Data" folder and delete the .ba2 files for the mods you wish to remove.
---
I am going to assume you know this already but your build is easily countered. I know crits negate sentinal assasin as i play it. I also know you could tweak your build for even more damage against us.
---
The easiest way for someone to take you out (Any serious pvper will know this)  Is to pop some berry mentats. This will highlight any living target and even do it thru walls. Your invize gear just got broke and your 1 hit away from death with your low heath build.
---
Your set-up can work very well against someone who doesn't know all the tricks or once in the right senarious but it has serious flaws. Berry Mentats light you up like a christmas tree.
---
DoN't ChEaT. It's that simple.
---
Try the waste dump southeast of whitesprings... Can usually get a lvl 91 to spawn at bottom.
---
Yeah ime if you have healing salve in your inventory it uses that before stimpacks even.
---
thx honey, i just wanted to say that i found your lingerie at EA, and i will be filing a divorce. My child Obsidian Entertainment will be coming with me.
---
The cave near the pumpkin house
---
I tend to agree. Did not get it myself back then, but i dont mind that that or other things in the future is only avaiable for a little while. It would kinda loose whats special about it if everyone have one.
---
Tell that to my skin burrowing parasites
---
no... what he said went over YOUR head... jesus, kid.   
---
and, btw... most people dont just randomly record their entire play session. thats ridiculous.   
---
fyi, one would only ever ask someone to prove a negative if they were, well... pretty much an idiot. appeal to ignorance... you really, really should look that up. no im not being facetious... look it up, youll help yourself a lot in these instances. i can tell you arent entirely retarded, and this may actually be the one time which I can pass this one to someone who wont just waste the knowledge. 
---
He's accusing Bethesda of lying about the amounts of multiple types of ammo he had now.  I'm sure they just used made up numbers...
---
Unless you are reporting people, yup
---
Oh no what we are complaining about is that he basically did this for views not to help anyone or do anything positive for the community literally he spent the first 5 minutes going through all of Bethesda's fuck ups you can tell clearly this was made for views and fake outrage 
---
Aaaaaaand he did. Well, at least more than the attempt here.
---
highly highly unlikely, and you knw it. the purden of proof is ALWAYS on the accuser... thats how i works.
---
I'm 110 can I even tame a level 91?
---
funny how that 4 months passed and now it's filled with hackers and glitches that was discovered at released. Say what you want, but the game isn't better then release, it's only worse.
---
Maybe players should be able to pay other players atoms to craft it for them? I think that would be kinda cool 
---
My sneak attacks are doing 3.75 dmg currently. I'm pretty sure I know how this happened but I'm not sharing :o also andrenal reaction is broke but I guess this is a fair trade :)
---
Good job!!! üëå
---
my impression of the game is that their are a lot of cheaters in it, and people getting banned for no reason. I also have the impression that it's still super glitchy. am I wrong? What part of what i said is wrong? shit post my ass, your just in denial.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Of course youtubers make videos for views...
---
As if they are going to make a video nobody is going to view...
---
People are still cross at the state the game released in and some just aren't over it yet unfortunately if you don't like that don't watch any of their videos i guess. I'm not a huge fan of 76 but i'm not in the purely positive (or at least crying about people who don't like the game rather than just the game) filthycasuals subreddit slagging the game off.
---
So, anyone knows a map that shows where the workstations are? I need to find the closest Chem station before my raw Flux decay. And a Tinker station to replenish my ammo stash. And so on...
---
Also I think Graham shares caps with some faction? I‚Äôve found him randomly and he had 0 caps so I assume it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs tied to some other faction, can‚Äôt speak on the other wandering merchants tho as I haven‚Äôt encountered them yet. 
---
fair enough, i don't mind being an asshole rofl I use a website where a bunch of opinionated assholes spend their entire day telling others how they are wrong for having a different view rofl. Can't share your view without a bit of toxicity, then you might as well act toxic yourself. xD
---
&gt;Where did you hear this?
---
A few inside the vaults ago bethesda admitted that they couldn't tell the difference between items even duped ones. Which means they have no way of following a stack of ammo because they have no unique ID.
---
As for bethesda not being able to look into peoples inventories? This was fully automated and we know how often bethesda has screwed up with this game in the recent past( releasing a old patch as a new one, having the lockpick sweet spot be client side, completely breaking the end game of the game for an entire week (when nukes just stopped working for a week), etc. 
---
No idea... But if thats no good, try deathclaw island to the Northwest of vault 76.
---
Zenimax did you a favor.
---
Trust me.
---
Move on with your life and forget about FO76.
---
I'm not for cheating, but the lock pick one I consider a grey area. I have played thousands of hours between all the fallout games and I don't need the lock pick mini game in my life any longer. We split up amicably back in FO:NV days.
---
The sub station outside of Watoga spawns an albino, regularly. 
---
If you go to the swamp just south of the chemical plant near Haven church, a few spawn with a team of supermutants. I watched that group for a long time, and it looked like they were talking to the deathclaws. 
---
Sometimes one will pop near the bathrooms to the west, across the green from the golf club. 
---
Lastly, in the triangle of the radio observatory, Sugar Grove, and the research facility, you can sometimes get a high level scorched deathclaw.
---
That's all I know about, as far as high level spawns. 
---
Given this is the early EARLY days of the bos, I really doubt it. 
---
Cool idea but fallout 3/4 and 76 are set about 190 years apart. And I believe that airship took quite some time and resources to cobble together from parts. I doubt they would have had sufficient time to build and design any airships yet. 
---
They‚Äôre still in an era of getting established as an organisation. 
---
Maybe a convoy of APC‚Äôs could arrive if Appalachia was deemed worth the manpower investment.
---
Some good news mate. The latest patch has certainly helped! 
---
I got 44 minutes solid gameplay before a crash to desktop, and before that only got some server not responding disconnects, which in total was about 2 hours of gaming before that CTD happened.
---
A significant improvement; not amazing; but somewhat playable now at least.
---
Might have a better chance on          R/choosingbeggars 
---
Is there anything wrong with mule characters? I have a super mule that i played to level 50, all weight reducing perks. I love it. I can collect weapons and armour that i would have just dropped before. Also sweet that my main can focus perks on kicking ass, and not managing weight. Also sweet is vendor caps reset per character, so i can grind 2800 caps a day. 10/10 reccomend everyone build a sweet mule.
---
Yes this, and magazines/ bobbleheads needs own tab
---
And it will grow again
---
They paid top dollar to have the chance to get that.
---
Not $39  or $10 .
---
Which makes early birds unique
---
My question though if your in PA how can you get a disease considering that the suit is air tight (you can can go underwater), and the suits cosmetically have either air tubes or a filter system on the helmets.
---
My answer, Bethesda.
---
I use a hazmat while swimming and aqua girl perk enabled.
---
The only issue is things in the water, mirelurks 
---
Is that because breakage is calculated per shot or damage expended,  as opposed to trigger pull?
---
The benefits of team mutations and perks pale in comparison to sheer numbers.  Just two people have 2x the possible health and 2x the damage output and you need to go through 2x the ammo to take them out, and that's without it being a team.  
---
If you choose to play solo on a PVP server, that's the risk you take.  There is no feasible option to prevent teaming up with other people.  Yes your at a disadvantage, if you don't want to be, you should partner up with someone else.  That's how survival games like this have always worked - such as DayZ
---
I have the similar idea right after the first wave hate after beta...Which can significant save this game.
---
But i don't think they will add it in the near future.
---
Its now a standard event
---
OK..... I don't see why you're angry...
---
I'm not exactly sure, but that's what I've always thought it was.
---
Yup. Junk in the box, stuff on the mule.
---
Actually... your comment is is horribly, horribly ass backwards.  its on Bethesda to PROVE here... This is why it is called the burden of proof, and if you know anytihng about accusations, law, or science you would know that the burden of proof is ALWAYS on the claimant/accuser. Its is nigh impossible to prove a negative rather than it is a positive.  
---
BGS has failed to meet the burden of proof on these instances, and I, along with many others KNOW we weret duping. What sucks is that lack of compassion for the fucking oer we have received. Is it really that hard to believe that Bethesda may have fucked up... AGAIN, as opposed to believing that every single person that is  appealing to the community for help in an unjust action is a liar?  
---
If this issue is about excessive amounts of items being in the game, then BGS is to blame anyway.... did they not fail to stop duping, over and over? Did they not fail to remove all of the excess items created? You just cannot blame people for taking free items they are giving, or picking up shit when its on the ground....   
---
I mean, I can tell you right now, I saw noobs running around picking up bags stuffed with duped items, not ever knowing the difference. I looted several bags without looking in them from people using carry  weight glitches stuffed to the brim with duped junk ... thats not fair. Thats not right... shit like that happened on accident... and youd be hard pressed to make me believe that almost everyone in this reddit hasnt taken duped items, whether on accident or on purpose.   
---
Point being this... I know, at least in my instance and in the instance of a few friends I met along the way, not a single one of us ever duped and we actively opposed it. Now, bc of this stupid shit, I have watched some of the kindest, non toxic, friendliest, and most generous players quit the game... meabwuile toxit shitlords are still here, fucking with them when they come for help. Bethesda is absolutely killing this game... everything before this, that they did, I was down with... but I know first hand, by my own experience and the experience of peope i truly know that this was wrong, all wrong.
---
Uh.... what is ADS?
---
Thank you!

This is a step in the right direction. Now we need some more content.

Grahm shares with Watoga station

Ehh I still do uranium fever event every time and I‚Äôm lvl 175. It‚Äôs one of the few places I know I‚Äôm guaranteed at least 3 legendaries and if that‚Äôs not a good enough reason then Idk what is. Also don‚Äôt understand why nuking whitesprings is unacceptable for higher lvl players? Some times you need mass quantities of hardened mass, glowing meat, etc.. and the ghouls are usually around lvl 62 so not exactly a cake walk imo
---
FWIW, it wasn't a non-controversy -- a lot of people were upset about it. And he is right in that it was something more than cosmetic, which is what Bethesda original promised. What it is is not a current controversy.
---
Haha thanks! 
---
Yeah but we are talking about bloodied here
---
Yeah, and that's why I said that it's probably safe to assume Bloodied works the same way.
---
Keep dreaming boy
---
They can do what they did in fallout 4 and patch them before releasing the update.
---
My whole camp is a big farm right outside Charleston Station. It's help yourself. 
---
GET OFF MY LAWN!!! üò°
---
Must be just you. Mine works fine.
---
Thanks!
---
Diggin the extra space. Gonna work at keeping 50lbs at all times now.
---
Except it's not? 
---
Gotta love it when someone gets angry at something like this that has always existed.  
---
All the time. Hasn't stopped since November.
---
Watoga actually shares it's cap pool with Grahm. Thpught he was broken for a while there...
---
I think we are far more than 6 ppl with the issue. Go bethesda , yet another great patch lol
---
Which also is why I said that it might possibly be wrong, but it's just the safe bet to assume it work the same and you have some effect enabled that we can't think of. Have any other Bloodied you can test with right now? I can't at the moment.
---
You...tried to murder a man for taking food that regenerates over time? A human life is less valuable to you than vegetables that respawn with no resource cost? And you're upset that the perpetrator just left instead of trying to kill you? 
---
Yeah couldn‚Äôt agree more, I never used to use melee weapons but the guns in this game are too damn weak, I tried a few times taking down a Queen mirlurk and decided to use a pick axe and well it did the trick ever since then that‚Äôs all I use, they need to figure this out anyone else noticing this? 
---
Ehhhh not trying to be a jerk but did you compare the damage before and after the mutation ? Or at least plug numbers into formula to see if the result match?
---
Because ‚ÄúTanky‚Äù is not a measurable thing. I am just trying to figure out the testing you did and how it‚Äôs done. And of course they could be stealth fix it too. Just want to know. 
---
I have encountered some people swear to god that bloody mess increase their Crit damage because they felt that. But actually with numbers and formula it does not. 
---
Seems like it was already fixed week ago. We suffered from this bug too, but last week everything was ok. 
---
No, we wants no scrubs. Scrubs are the kind of guy that gets no love from us.
---
&gt;But why coming out with such a nice paint so close to release date?
---
Because on release F76 had much bigger playerbase than it has now. It made total sense to release it back then than it would be to release it now.
---
How about they give us working shoulder lights too? I want mole rats to back off with burnt retinas from the three flood lights on the front of my armour.
---
The game has level scaling in every area except the green zone.... 
---
&gt;... you probably don‚Äôt need that extra carry weight anymore.... 
---
Typical salesman, always lying!
---
Ash Heap, Forest, and Toxic Valley all appear to have caps on creature level.  Pretty much the whole west side.  Not just the Forest. 
---
What about increased TS weapon wear?  The gatling is also super accurate hip fired unless you have a TS variant and has issues with aiming.  And when using heavy weapons (non explosive) outside of power armor, AA stomps TS as your Stabilized will stop working.
---
You are also stating that the queen has 185 ballistic DR - you should clarify that is with Stabilized.  She has 300 ballistic DR.
---
The much underrated variant to me is actually Furious - it ramps up to 1.3, doesn't have the negatives of the TS...  I'd rather use a Furious in power armor over TS/AA for the Queen.  I can't say though if Furious/Explosive is working correctly - some people claim Furious is broken with Explosive, in which case, TSE/AAE might be better in that regard.
---
and except the toxic valley... except the ash heap... etc...
---
You can also take things from people's extractors and purifiers without getting wanted, if they don't put a lock on them. The part that flagged you as stealing is picking the lock. Kinda hard to put a lock on a plant.
---
I‚Äôve seen it happen at the Flatwoods red rocket.   Their corpses reanimate and walk around but are still dead. 
---
Weren't you the one on chat mod saying people shouldn't have 100,000 of a certain item even if they were donated?
---
Why are you begging here now.
---
SBQ is bugged for real. Had two nukes that night, never eat even half of her HP. Everebody just leave. 
---
Still an issue 2-20-2019 and they just updated again submitted a ticket but well its Bethesda expect nothing to be done about it
---
Yeah, sarcasm means saying something then saying the opposite, both while being sarcastic.
---
If you're waiting for idiot savant to kick in I've got bad news for you.
---
No, that's exactly where your junk bag should be after walking into a fissure.
---
I think that bug was here since maybe even New Vegas. It's goddamn gamebryo or what it's now being called. Gets me everytime. 
---
Yes, I wasn't talking about condition. If that were the case, unmodded plain weapons would be the best.
---
I addressed hipfire at the bottom of my post.
---
Why are you talking about other perks? If you add Stabilized to both TS and AA, so it's a fair comparison, TS is better...
---
That DR is *not* with stabilized. She has 185 ballistic. Energy is 200 and something, I forgot. And she's immune to rads, just a side not. Please check sources.
---
We're not comparing other legendaries... I personally prefer Bloodied over everything, but I didn't mention that because it's unnecessary. The whole point of this post is to mention that TSE is always to superior to AA in PvE.
---
AA *anything* is inferior to TS, dude. All the points you made are either false or off-topic.
---
*small growl*
---
*screams his Damn lungs out to the Point where it does damage*
---
Outside of the lighthouse event, twice. Once near the Atlas Observatory where he just teleported around and scared the shit out of me, and once in the Mire near Abbie's bunker, where he was scorched, aggro, and still teleported around and scared the shit out of me. I am ashamed to say I slew our lord and savior that day. I choose to believe he was testing whether his most devoted disciple could survive in the world, and that I passed. 
---
Hopefully he will see my new PA paint job and it will please him, and he will once again bless me with his presence. 
---
The pic posted many items over 100k.  Do the math his 1 toon, was pushing a million if not already each time he logged on with each toon.
---
I‚Äôve had folks attempt to trade w/me and weird stuff suddenly happens. I‚Äôm not saying theyre dupers but 
---
Running away or server hopping usually fixes it.
---
Also, when my toon is overburdened, I can see how slow they get when they‚Äôre just a couple hundred pounds over. Imagine that in hundreds of thousands pounds.
---
I don‚Äôt believe pushing mats to a dedicated mule to farm can get the numbers you claim.
---
That means 900 guy would have a steady stream of folks with him pushing mats to farm as well.
---
But assuming 900 guy did have folks working with him, then yeah they‚Äôre part of whining banned.
---
FWIW, ZeniMax/ Bethesda patching is constantly weeding out mules w/deep pockets.  If you‚Äôre a mule and you haven‚Äôt ditched all that extra weight they‚Äôre coming for you. Not a question of why, but when.
---
Well, maybe for that gun, my .45mm submachine does 53 damage with hardened reciever and 40 with Scorch Killer Reciever, so plus the 50% it would do 60 damage against scorched and 40 against everything else.
---
My question is does it only affect scorched humanoids or every scorched creature, including the queen and her minions.
---
Fools, we are already in! 
---
Where did Bethesda confirm this? I'm not saying that I don't think it's broken, I just never saw confirmation.
---
Well juicehead needs something to fucking moan about doesn't he....
---
OK so what your saying is that they should be at the level of the highest level in the area? That seems pretty unfair to anyone lower level then you.
---
How does that affect non ballistic? I have a two shot Fatman and it does one more point of damage than a normal Fatman.
---
Dead?
---
Hate when you accidentally pop a dose of psycho instead of the pork n‚Äô beans.... 
---
What‚Äôs lookup failed?

Im curious as to how they are identifying the dupers?

---
I would of thought all as  a while back my Mrs used a scorched killer pump shotgun on a scorched deathclaw and destroyed it. She didn't even have any shotgunner perks on lol
---
Which is?
---
I've seen that many are overlooking the fact that we have faster loading times.Also now the game just frezees for a split second after fast travelling.
---
This a major quality of life improvement to me.
---
The reaponder protectrons like Skyping each other constantly or even having some private Telegram channel where they coordinating how much caps each player traded every day. That makes them kinda smart. But in the ex-76 dwellers culture it's sure considered a dick move. 
---
Well, explosives count as ballistic damage. I'm not sure about Fat Mans (Men? üòÇ). Do you have any mods on either of them? Are they the same level?
---
The OP wants these largely unexplored areas to have higher spawn capabilities so that he has reason to go there.  Currently no one goes there and when anyone does the max level enemies are level 1-6.
---
Who? Oh wait I couldn't care less and neither should anyone else.
---
And you shouldn't make threads about idiots to spread their name
---
Oh FFS. This is not the sort of thing OP is looking for. You would like to think you are being helpful, but you aren't. You aren't clever, you aren't witty, and you sure as hell aren't wise. 
---
He was just stating a fact. I would gladly say that however.
---
Low levels aren't going to stay low level forever and I think there should be fewer low level events and places than higher level ones.
---
Underground enemy bug.  I find Bloat Flies are the worst when they do this as they can shoot through the ground up at you.  
---
Just run away.
---
You are missing the latest strings.
---
Check for updates in your chosen favour of tagging/sorting mod. 
---
How do the peasants play without it all the time? I spent a shit load of mats crafting armour before I realized my muscle memory change of load out hadn't actually changed anything!
---
Excellent work here on the map. And once I understood that this was based on your own travels it made sense as to why you picked these items. 
---
I traveled a bit in WV last year before the game came out, and one of the most amazing things I did was to visit the [Green Bank Telescope](http://greenbankobservatory.org/). Definitely a must see if you visit WV.
---
Wow, were you born this much of an ass or did it take time for you to grow into it? 
---
How do you tame? Do you just pacify it? I have max budget.
---
Why link to his video and which means more views?
---
All you folks sounds like you got never properly tried to engage a pvp fight with a melee build against any kind of ranged build, you are gonna be wrecked open field.
---
And for those who are gonna say ‚Äúi can‚Äôt care less about pvp‚Äù, well the real problem for the pve is the ‚Äúlow‚Äù damage from several ranged enemies and their poor targeting response against the player. 
---
Close combat should be ‚Äúhigher risks / more dmg reward‚Äù.. actually in the current state the game allows you to rush into groups of ranged enemies and just go full berserker with the aid of just one or two stimpaks... 
---
True! That would have been funny! :D ...but they did have weapon enchantments (lightning, chill, soul trap, etc.) that made them powerful; plus you could use magic spells (freeze, fire, etc.) as well. Oh, and let's not forget about those shouts!  
---
I always kill the turrets. They're annoying and i like a nice little bounty also if they kill a 3* without me hitting it. I'm destroying that whole base 
---
Actually it‚Äôs vice versa. TS does increase recoil and explosive doesn‚Äôt.  I got AAE, TSE and BE handmade. 
---
It was there last night. Empty, but there
---
Yeah that is true. 
---
if you are in xbox right stick pressed in allowes you to ‚Äúsort by‚Äù. one choice is ‚Äúspoil‚Äù. choosen, all my perishable food is at the bottom of the list all next to each other.

I wasn't sure about Explosive, but I know TS doesn't. Can you provide or video or something, please?
---
Same here, after dropping in my alternate armour set, weapons outfits etc this morning I‚Äôm now up to 748 so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going to try and keep it and be super disciplined on what I pick up. Was great to finally blow a load of atoms on a monocle and outfits from the atom store to this morning now I‚Äôm not stuck using P.A lol
---
I‚Äôm upvoting for your passion in changing this sub perception.
---
But suggest your fight has 2 fronts.
---
Here in this sub and more importantly, ingame where they peddle their wares. As much as ZeniMax and Bethesda try, there will always be prix trying to work the system
---
I fully expect dupers to ditch or get banned but its revenue stream for them 
---
They‚Äôll hide in the shadows to see what and where they can exploit
---
I bet 900 guy is already trying to find ways of getting back in...
---
Hmmmm.... no consistent answers really. I‚Äôll just assume based on the prime reciever description that it doesnt affect scorchbeasts but does all other scorch creatures. Even so, would love to see a solid answer
---
No worries, I wish you good luck!
---
What a jackass you are. 
---
It's true; both IRL and in video games- I work smart, not hard. Does society characterize this as lazy or efficient? Doesn't matter to me, so long as success follows in the wake of (minimally efficient) action...it's been working out pretty well thus far. :)
---
I also assumed this tied her to helvetia and german roots.
---
She has 300 ballistic, 300 energy.  Go recheck your numbers.  185 is with Stabilized and a Heavy Weapon if you check with Awareness.
---
Talk about the person inferring I'm making false/off-topic items when he can't even get the queen's DR correct.  You can't compare things in isolation, we have to view the big picture.
---
I never see the one by the assaultron under the register in the Whitespring bunker anymore.
---
The one, ONE person that plays their ass game and you get wrongly banned.
---
God help this company. No power left in our mortal realm that can.
---
Holy shit, never occurred to me more than one mod could be broken. Got so used to the QoL "just working" I forgot it was mod support providing it.  
---
I used to get LOOKUP FAILED before I was using mods though so I never made the connection.  
---
Much appreciated.
---
"No, keep playing." -Bethesda
---
Had two SBQ battles after patch, failed both time. Everybody just leave. It was really easy before, even few days ago, when we dropped our first nuke with my wife and killed SBQ with one random guy.
---
I don't have adrenal reaction, but i think my damage output is somehow lowered too. 
---
Your calculation numbers are wrong but the conclusion is right. 
---
I just didn‚Äôt post it. 
---
Also bloodied is not cap at 50% and furious is cap at 25%. 
---
That's what nukes are for.
---
I‚Äôve had the chameleon mutation it‚Äôs slick. Not while wearing PA though.
---
Sadly lost it. 
---
The chameleon armor is nice too but without added strength or protection youre naked. 
---
I know I mean it could of changed since I played 76 so I have no clue
---
Imagine feeling like such a self righteous jerk that you have to hang around subreddits and read posts about things you DON'T like, and then expend energy attacking anyone who appears to actually have been enjoying the game, rather than just, instead, taking the time to play or find a game you actually enjoy? Who's the real loser here? 
---
Dead... but in!
---
Fast travel/enter buildings one at a time

shush now we've moved on
---
Shit, you're right. I used the wrong screenshot. I updated the numbers, thank you for telling me.
---
Pleasure.
---
Whoa now don't be suggesting stuff thats common sense, you know  thats not how bethesda works. Good suggestion though, shame this idea won't be listened to. 
---
Im so dumb. what is ADS?
---
LOL stop chatting shit,  you traded me a weightless armor set for a serum recipe a while back and then offered me the exact same set for something else a couple days later, your both a duper and a idiot, acting all innocent and shitüòÇ 
---
 this post if fucking hilarious 
---
Duping has provided enjoyment where this game would never provide it with the shotty unrewarding loot system they have. And again it‚Äôs easy to get tunnel vision and only blame duping but this game has had performance issues with or without duping. Even now there are people complaining about performance issues and crashes.
---
One retailer in a foreign country giving it away for free does not make a decision for the whole corporate structure, but I wouldn't expect someone like you to grasp nuances.
---
There's no reason anyone should be banned for ammo when you can make it so easily. 
---
I can chew through 10,000 .50 on my alt easily in a few hours play. I made 10,000 .50 ultracite last night on my main to give to my alt and that ate up my stack of flux that wasn't muled. I would have made more if someone else were on and had the patience for me to screw around looking across characters to find it all.
---
The reason this problem exists is  because of how poorly this game handles inventory management. It all flows back to that. Don't get me wrong, I love FO76 but this is its crutch.

---
I'm not sure if it has ever been acknowledged beyond this or if it is fixed. I gave up on stealth snipping after the TSE nerf and this bug.
---
I think you‚Äôre not understanding my last post, I‚Äôm cool with people teaming up but I don‚Äôt think you should actually be able to be in a team together and benefit off team perks/mutations. It honestly sounds like we both agree on that so I appreciate the feedback. 
---
I guess I‚Äôm just a little bitter because of all the PvP traps people set up where you think you‚Äôre only fighting one person but turns out everybody in the area is on a team and you‚Äôre severely outnumbered.
---
At this point I‚Äôm just ready for Survival mode and I‚Äôll have a blast either way, but having free for all and team faction servers would be really cool imo and add a lot more variety. 
---
Meh, I‚Äôll slap it on, it sounds cool lol.

Human use big words. Devilpup no understand. Devilpup want to smash üòâ

As a Minnesotan, I think an 'Ope' emote would cover about everything I need.
---
Wow you're on a nickname basis with Bethesda now? Beth? Haha. 
---
Good, now avoid a subreddit about a game you don't play. 
---
Yes, I realized that and updated. I had used the wrong screenshot.
---
After testing more, I realize that Bloodied has no cap. I've never used a Furious and tested, but I was just recently told it was capped at +30%, so I don't know which to even believe.
---
Be happy that you could loot them - I have the same problem but my ghouls couldn't be looted - they just lay on the ground like a background. I've lost loot from \*\*\* that spawned (I just seen for the fraction of second it was Legendary Cryolator :( FUCK bethesda quality control (if exists....)
---
From where are you getting the damage multiplier data for your variables? I agree with your algebraic operations, but I‚Äôd like to see the source where you derived your values for ‚Äúfurious,‚Äù ‚Äúbloody,‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-armor‚Äù (I can safely assume ‚Äútwo-shot‚Äù is twice as powerful as one shot).  Thank you in advance. I‚Äôve been trying to figure this all out, myself. :)
---
Shameless melee player here. Bloodied is good but I've got an anti-armour meat hook that ignores 50% of target armour and that hook is the bomb. It's my go-to back-up weapon. I don't do 2k worth of damage, tho. I'm not that sort of melee.
---
Ah ty for the info 
---
Both are the same level one is a Daisy cutter modded back to a standard fatman the other is a a TS.
---
Basically, he has a modded game, like most of us, but has not updated the mods that edit the strings. so he gets LOOKUP FAILED. Once he updates they'll be gone.
---
perks are the same for each upgrade between those armors, what camo pattern?  you can change the skin on underarmor?
---
I always said TSE needed balancing and I'm glad it got it. Melee is still OP and needs it too. Even 1000 damage on something is ridiculous.
---
Not sure what platform you're on, but if it's PC my Warframe ID is QU67. Got about 650 hours in the game, so if you have a question or need help with something I'd be happy to help.  
---
Just a warning: Warframe is very grindy and does not do a good job of explaining most of its system or their importance. The Warframe wiki is your friend.
---
Oh, I agree, TSE was OP and needed to be tweaked a little to be on par with melee/unarmed builds, but Bethesda should have buffed other builds as well to give players other options. I like role-playing as BoS or Enclave, so I want my energy weapons to be great again (M.E.G.A)! :D
---
In regards to the SBQ, pre-patch 5, I saw an unarmed knock her from half health (after her health regen) to dead in about 2 seconds. I'm sure they were stacking bobbleheads and sneaking, but my TSE on its best day couldn't do that. Then again, I didn't make use of any exploits either, so yeah.
---
I did kept telling my friend trade the AA out when it is still in hype though. Now you are the person that destroyed the economy single handedly which is why I didn‚Äôt post. ;)
---
really wish I could
---
Well maybe he should be
---
 900 hours in a game. FFS, what a waste of time and life. 
---
This is absolutely ridiculous. As a melee character from lvl 1, I picked up a lvl 5 explosive shotgun at lvl 15 and used that for almost 100 lvls. I would bust out my melee weapons every once and a while but it just didn't compare to an explosive shotgun. It took almost no effort or skill. Ran vanguard heavy combat armor and never died unless I killed myself. 
---
I diligently (over 225 lvls) collected bloodied weapons, a full set of unyielding heavy combat armor, and the perfect combo mutations. Now I feel about as powerful as I was when I was lvl 90 running around with a lvl 5 shotgun and full vanguard. Still die alot more though. 
---
Yeah I can kill the SBQ really fast with my build. I also could when I swapped perks around to run a 1* furious prime Gatling gun with overdrive and PA armor piercing. 
---
TSE was just easy mode and needed a nerf. You didn't need to optimize or sacrifice much to get endgame damage. 
---
Bloodied has no cap. Being at 75% HP gives a 25% boost, being at 50% HP gives a 50% boost, and so on.
---
I'm not sure on the Furious cap, but I think it might be at +25% or +50%.
---
AA is straight up -50% of target's resists.
---
TS used to be +100%, which many thought was OP, but was nerfed about a month ago. This is why people though AA was now superior to TS.
---
This, but with Enclave.
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about the op. I meant to reply to another poster in regards to everyone calling out the op for posting this.
---
I had no issues with them last night. It‚Äôs the only way into my camp
---
I'd like to be able to eat things I see laying around right from 1st person view. Kinda like how you eat the hotdogs at camden daily quest. Instead of picking it up and going into your inventorry to eat it.
---
You hit the main reason as to why guns can never be as strong as melee on a hit for hit basis. Unlike FO4, there are no melee perks that give you sweeping AOE attacks so you literally have to run up and hit each enemy at least once. If guns were as strong as melee then team play would really suck as it would be far less likely for multiple players to tag enemies before they go down.
---
Maybe people like you feel the need to take a dump on things other people enjoy. How wonderful of you, you sound like that is really helping you out.
---
It is weird that if you are testing and you don‚Äôt have variation of the same gun.......
---
It‚Äôs true. I don‚Äôt have time to provide you the video tbh. Just acquire those guns and test it yourself. 
---
Before I get into testing I only use TSE, and when the nerf hit I start using bloodied and I suddenly realize how less recoil and more accuracy of guns that I am using. And that got me into testing realm. I am 100% sure that TS make more recoil and less accuracy. 
---
Ah, Uniques always do more damage than their regular counterparts.
---
Nope you're still an asshole. 
---
How many hours did you put into Skyrim, or Fallout 4,3, or New Vegas? 
---
and where is the Radiation Emitter now?
---
How about I unequip all perk cards and redo it with a bloodied lever, a bloodied gatlin, and a none legendary lever as a baseline? Say 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%? 
---
I never tested recoil, I'm just talking from experience. I could be wrong, but I'm fairly certain it doesn't affect it.
---
Wish you were on XB1 I‚Äôve got 3 extras but can‚Äôt remember where I found them sorry

---
\`you need maxed Animal Friend perk. You should then get an option to Pacify or Tame. If you tame you will then have an option to send to your camp. 
---
Good patch, I guess. However, as many problems as this game has, you need to be patching this stuff **WEEKLY**. A ton of potential, but who wants to wait around for another 6 months just to get the basic problems fixed? The communication is terrible and with every item you patch, you break something that worked. There are so many core things that are broke, it is becoming ridiculous. Maybe you should keep "early access" or "beta" on your loading screens to give you an excuse. It worked for Fortnite PVE. That game may be a "dirty" word here, but at least they patched their stuff weekly and communicated with the community to make the game better. Not so much here.
---
Did I mention that your communication is terrible?
---
Did I mention that you have basic core issues with your game and your priorities need a little rearranging?
---
I can go hide like a little bitch and contest workshops now, but I cannot even reliably spawn into my own camp without being inside the map or foundations. Sounds like a win.

The Periodic Table is in her parents room.

The tape you mentioned has her talk about her father grading papers, so I think he was a teacher/professor (unsure where though).

Adrenal Reaction is not working since patch 6.
---
I have 5 mutations, and I really don't feel like playing the lottery removing them, paying for the serums again, and then hoping the re-apply sticks. 
---
You want the Albino one from random encounter spawns. Try Crevasse Dam, at the intersection. I get the deathclaw there a lot
---
Test and tell please. Not trying to be a jerk. Just the argument won‚Äôt be an argument once you tested it. 
---
If you take the right perks you can send animals (only aminals from random encounters) home. They take up budget so you have to have room
---
Yup, you're right. Bloodied has no cap. It can hypothetically reach +100% dmg, but you'd be dead. My friend tested and showed me a bunch of screenshots and proof. Thank you.
---
I will
---
Just re-run the translator utility and rebuild the strings files in the game.
---
Luckily me and a friend glitched in without dying slot of ultracite would have been lost
---
I have also seen whole powerarmor as pink too, not just random pip boys.
---
&gt; nukes

You mean either the SBQ grind or Whitespring for a truckload of 1 props ? Because those are the 2 only zones people dare to nuke.

In any case : z¬≤z¬≤¬≤zZ¬≤zZZ¬≤¬≤ZzZZZ
---
shhush now
---
What anti armor does but not TSE. Just curious from your standpoint. 
---
Is there any way you can pinpoint this location a little better for me? I would love to give it a go. Leveling has been such a grind for me. 
---
This has been the only thing I‚Äôve spent real money on and I don‚Äôt regret it for one second. It looks badass. Today I‚Äôm debating spend real money again for that mothman statue. Equally as badass if you‚Äôre into building fancy camps

Careful with the name calling, dude, you could get banned. Why are you so mad about this? It‚Äôs a video game, I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt get this riled up over real world issues, so why do you have so much hate for some dude who duped a virtual toy in a virtual world? The PvP in this game is basically nonexistent. Every time I try, I get a thumbs down emote and they run away. And why worry about a dude‚Äôs duped weapon? Have him dupe it for you haha
---
I recall someone saying that weapon condition reduces based on hits. Since TS weapons double your projectiles for normal weapons, your condition drops twice as fast if you're scoring twice as many hits
---
I saw high tech light set plans on sale yesterday.  I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to where though. My usual route is:
---
Flatwoods, Sutton, Whitespring, Enclave, Watoga, Phoenix, Harpers. 
---
Pretty sure it was one of the last three.
---
Some of the CAMP plans still rotate.  I see lockers, benches, and tool chests on/off each day.  Took me a couple hops to find that Tool Chest.  
---
Nah you can get disesases from waist-high water, the game will give you a prompt saying "you risk waterborn disease" when you stand in water.
---
It wasn't before the most recent patch so if it's now it's a sneaky "fix".
---
That's different. I plan on using my CAMP as a portable DPS station. If I'm not farming, I'm moving it out of the zone or storing the turret.
---
Can we please get a hotfix for this? We've just spent the entire last patch cycle with broken mutations, don't want to have to do it again...
---
Empty would be ok but it's just not there anymore.
---
Considering the fact that TSE weapons were easily able to do 500+ damage a shot with the right perk cards at a range, with some guns being fully automatic, I believe it was a welcome change. The big difference is that melee weapons require you to get up close and therefore tank a lot of hits. Farming ghouls becomes painful when you get overwhelmed, deathclaws can chunk your health with a single swipe, and fighting/killing scorchbeasts is literally impossible unless you somehow get them to land. It was wholly right to nerf TSE weapons, and maybe melee weapons do indeed need a nerf themselves, but you can't take away from the fact that, at their prime, TSE weapons absolutely dominated the field of best weapons by far.
---
From what I've read of people's experience, durability loss is always calculated on a per hit basis. This is why say the scattershot laser mod makes laser rifles break super fast.
---
Mind that faster firing weapons, mostly, have proper reductions to their durability loss per hit so they break at a reasonable rate.
---
I always turn subtitles on too, I retain information better when I hear AND see what is spoken. Atleast the radio drama has a clean crisp orator. It‚Äôs easy to understand the story
---
True, but with how minimal the other bonuses are the extra armor piercing is likely better. Most larger magazine sizes are nothing compared to FO4, save for a few such as the handmade and gatling gun.
---
For free, right? Or for $20 in Atoms? Imma guess which one it is :)
---
This plan is only found on Graham and is not guaranteed to be carried as its a camp plan.
---
Appreciate the update and change to the main post, having accurate numbers is a good thing!
---
one of the only intelligent posts here.
---
That would be a terrible idea. 
---
I don't give Bethesda any credit and the people who make these "lets thank Bethesda for the great fixes this week" - i'm pretty sure they're just doing it for karma whoring. 
---
You think fixes we got this week is worthy of any praise? There are way smaller studios pushing out way better updates for other games. The most content we've gotten since the game dropped was all the reddit drama.
---
Cheaters, dupers, exploiters, ALL of them aside none of this bullshit we went through would have happened if they knew what a hotfix actually was and didn't let the shit exist for 2 fucking months.
---
Awesome! Thanks for sharing that it worked!
---
Well, that‚Äôs just what Mothman does. Only some of them stay to fight. (I think the red or green eyed ones?) Vengeful Mothman for sure, and then Glowing or Scorched.
---
omg I been looking them everyday after the previous upadate and I havent found them since
---
Nice! Very well designed, I like it!
---
I like what you did with the roofs, I have a hard time making mine not looking square/boring
---
Do you have targeting HUD on your power armor? It causes crashes.
---
You all just can‚Äôt seem to get it right. So happy that I put this awful game down months ago. 
---
Sounds annoying, but if that's a functioning workaround we might try it, thanks!
---
I'm not sure the reason why, but I do know that TS breaks faster.
---
Love the castle shape
---
Looking to the future of good updates
---
Yup!
---
My two shot gatling is not lacking. I shoot lvl 80 scorched beast out of the sky. It does take some shots but still. 
---
The PA perk for penetrating/heavy weapons helps and since the TS nerf it helps to pop a hit of dope. Usually psycobuff or overdrive.
---
Nah, she's just a big Weird Al fan and got the accordion autographed...
---
It‚Äôs just unfortunate for people who were incorrectly flagged. I‚Äôve read people got suspensions for having too much junk and ammo. I actually fell into this suspension for the same. With that said, don‚Äôt loot or farm too much or you‚Äôll be next lol 
---
You know where is milk... of human kindness? Do you seen Mack Beth?
---
Haha Murder Church is awesome. Even more suprised you were able to do that on xbox, the joystick placement controls are hard to work with sometimes.
---
Flatwoods camps are pretty slick too!
---
I have a ps4 but I play on pc lol
---
The downside to this is all the legendary loot that comes from the quests scales with level; I was annoyed to learn that my Summerset Special could have been much more awesome had I waited until later to turn it in. The downsides of questing at low levels far outweigh any benefit.
---
Well i wanna loot your house irl but i have to pick lock to your door and i'll become wanted for that. So screw it, now you just don't have right to put that door on your house. 
---
What do they do when they get home? Do they become temporary companions or like guards?
---
Sad but true.  Some people just show up to get the loot and not fight the queen.  There should be a cap of damage that is met before you can get an award.
---
Drop a nuke anywhere and it becomes a max level zone. The events become max level. What op is asking for is the intended usage of nukes. Op can drop nukes on the areas and have max level zones. That's what they're there for. Drop a nuke on Morgantown and collision course now spawns waves of level 68 scorched. Back on the beat spawns bloated glowing ones. Why would Bethesda bother changing an entire area's spawns when they gave us nukes to do it? Lol
---
Thats pretty creative man! Definitely got the castle look down inside and out!
---
Devilpup, hungry....Need food...
---
No I understand why it was there ppl couldn‚Äôt understand why Bethesda did something no one asked for 
---
Nuka grape removes rads, but not mutations.
---
Where is your camp located? What system are you on? I have only see the mothman once
---
You're not wrong. We're still seeing huge patches of pure bug fixes 90+ days into the game now. I wonder when the game will finally exit beta.
---
Well graphics always looked strange, so i had to turn on nvidia dsr and now im playing in 2880x1800 or something scaled down to 1920x1200, with that game looks much much better. 
---
Guards. They'll die for your base. Don't get anything that carries a good sum of caps, mats or a legendary. People will kill for them
---
&gt; as personal power armor stations in homes existed
---
I always though it was car station, but used by wastelanders for PA (because most of them are in red rocket stations, like the Atom Cats)
---
From where are you getting these figures/statistics? Do you have a link? Just trying to verify and do my own calculations for other applications. 
---
so carry less shit with you
---
Can‚Äôt break concrete right?
---
I've been attacked by invisible mole miners before. I wouldn't say it's common but something to be aware of I suppose.
---
There's also that bug where like approx every hour you just randomly take some damage from nowhere.
---
Yeah, sadly no so much as "confirmed" as much as "thank you for your report"
---
Also, the owners of workshops are displayed on the map with the current update.
---
You do get XP for turret kills if you tag the mob before it dies.
---
I'm on PC and its near whitesprings...
---
Why would you ever ever play with mouse and keyboard, when you can buy a decent controller and dive in a whole new gaming experience? 
---
Nononono never re-release 
---
Yeah maybe for Bethesda‚Äôs bottom line but not for the community, if you‚Äôve got the time do you mind elaborating on why it‚Äôs a terrible idea?
---
Bloodied was my own personal testing, along with some friends. You might be able to find it somewhere, or you can do it yourself by taking rad damage and looking at the pipboy dmg stat.
---
Furious has been tested by people, but I personally don't know.
---
AA says right there in the description.
---
TS used to obviously be 100%, but Bethesda put in their patch notes that TS got nerfed to 25%. You can also easily compare with a non-TS.
---
Cool thanks this was what I was looking for.
---
Can you bind a PTT button on your controller? 
---
Nobody ever does that.
---
LOL
---
Tee hee
---
We're fighting a losing battle here.  It seems like many people thing that mtx is ok.  It's not.  They've been conditioned to think it is.  Mtx are not ok, especially when the game should still be in beta.
---
Thanks for the update, glad I didnt try this. I hope there is a fix soon so I can play again. 
---
Add in an "Ahh Cripes!" Emote and that pretty well covers everything.
---
Hi if you dont want it i take it.i realy want to play it but dont have a single cap.
---
Ive seen him once since it started, Before the event I could find him each log in.
---
So what if no one does it? That doesn't change what they do and what they're supposed to do. 
---
No, it's been like that since the patch that made the stashes instanced. Half the times I go for a stash, it's not there. You might just have been lucky if it was there for you every time between patches.
---
I looted both bunker stashes last night, so no, no stealth nerf.
---
My god Bethesda this Mothman event is great lvl 236 love it  thanks PA looks great (already purchased)
---
I also see a whole power armor as pink yesterday.  It almost burned my eyes off ;D
---
Ive seen it three times, two of those times was after successfully completing the mothman event at the lighthouse.
---
+1
---
Not a bad idea 
---
I just liked that I got to see one. I even bought his hat.
---
You mean what ? Grinding for the nuke for 30 minutes, wasting a keycard just so one can get level 68 schorched that drop nothing interesting whatsoever and a few 1 props. 
---
I get better loot by visiting a bunch of known high level places without even dropping a nuke there.
---
And bulk items!!..
---
&gt; Why are you so mad about this?
---
Because i've repeated myself over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and you fail to grasp the importance of what i'm saying, dismissing it all together as "BUH BUH IS JUST A GAEM WHY U HEF BE MED".
---
You're literally defending a cheater, a man who literally broke the rules of the game and duped his weapons and ammo, then came here to bitch about how it was unfair whenever bethesda caught him only to have it come to light that he actually was 100% in the wrong. You don't have the high ground here. Like...There is no argument here. 
---
&gt; It‚Äôs a video game, I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt get this riled up over real world issues,
---
No, you're correct i don't. However, i'm more pissed about your flat out refusal to understand what the fuck it is i'm trying to tell you. Again, **you're defending a cheater. Someone who literally broke the rules of the game and came here to whine about it only to have it come to light that he was 100% in the wrong for everything**. Like...Jesus goddamn christ, i shouldn't have to explain this 500 times until you get it. 
---
If you want to bitch about the fucking game bitch about actual goddamn issues, like the server drops or the glitches, don't fucking make up shit like this prick, just because you're pissed that bethesda put out a game that you don't like. 
---
&gt;so why do you have so much hate for some dude who duped a virtual toy in a virtual world?
---
This. This is why i keep calling you an idiot. It's not about a "virtual toy". It's about the integrity that this community should have that has been getting drowned out by people like you excusing it. Again, if i knowingly cheat at a game, i should be banned. Fullstop. 
---
No one is above these rules. You can't just pick and choose what shit you want to follow. 
---
&gt;The PvP in this game is basically nonexistent. Every time I try, I get a thumbs down emote and they run away.
---
Irrelevant. 
---
&gt;And why worry about a dude‚Äôs duped weapon? Have him dupe it for you haha
---
See my second to last point. 
---
Well, you could try not being a level 17 character near Whitesprings...
---
Karma whoring? Hahaha. Have you been in this sub long? They hire two-three PR kids at the cost of one dev, consider those posts authored by shills. Anytime I see someone argue in favor of Bethesda it‚Äôs the exact same script handed down through corporate. 
---
Speech check pass every time. 
---
for some reason anti armor negates the damage reduction you get from sentinel armor lol
---
Like I said... At least 90% of the time I've come across a turret camp it's vacant... The owner isn't tagging shit.
---
What they **are** doing is fucking up spawns for anyone that goes to WS while they're off doing who the fuck knows what, who the fuck knows where... 
---
Harpers Ferry will spawn ghouls, Super Muties or Scorched. The spawns seem random so it's possible to get glowing ones there
---
I just want it to prevent rad damage from collecting dirty water. If I have aquaboy and level 3 lead belly then why do I get rads from collecting water. I can be completely submerged and not take any, but the moment I put it in a fucking bottle.
---
What a clever shitpost. Go post this shit on r/Fallout for 7 New Vegas points.
---
When you're barely ankle deep. That's always been hilarious to me.
---
You got time tomorrow Thursday? Could we test this please ? I want to know if it is the anti armor thing or just simply the DR reduction is acting a role in it. 
---
So go do that and don't go to the area you aren't willing to nuke. 
---
Can confirm... TS is awful in VATS. I regularly dump them in the ice chest at White Springs.
---
He is completely in the right people can't face criticism. I mean saying he probably hasn't put more than 25 hours into the game. How the fuck does that even matter that's like saying a movie critic is low effort for only watching it once. 
---
Good one, you're going to catch some with that one.
---
Every patch that comes along make me think that there might be only two or three people working on this game now.  Either that or the Fallout 4/Skyrim code was so poorly labeled, it's taking them an eternity to find the bugs.
---
So my point is, I don't think they have the staff to run a test server.  I think they took the money and ran.
---
Just because a TOS says something doesn't mean it is legal, look at the huge lawsuit going against bethesda already due to this game from the bag controversy, remember their TOS says you aren't allowed to have a class action against them. Yet, the law firm has already gone ahead and started the class action lawsuit.
---
Man. 
---
You've clearly never grown up. 
---
If you can't see the fallacy in your reasoning then, yes, you would appear to have a very limited IQ. 
---
With that attitude maybe.
---
Was the gulper still hanging in a tree when you did that? I haven't noticed any healing enemies with the one exception of gulpers hanging in trees. Seems no matter how much damage I do while they're hanging when they hit the ground they get all their health back.
---
For me it's the Grafton Monster
---
Why though?
---
Nope I had done all the updates per normal but when I went to do this recent update it was like 52 GB....  
---
Foundations are the only indestructable item as far as I know. All of the concrete barriers in defense are destructable. 
---
You know the problem with this right? What if the new patch has exploits? Then only the testers will have access to a patch with exploits and people will use them. Giving people 2 different builds to play is a bad idea. I say it be broken for everybody or nobody. What they need is more internal testing. If they can't get it done properly in the alloted time frame, they need to hire more people.
---
I've tested this theory with the 10mm Sub machine gun, Shooting a Clean Wall at 30 yards +/-;
---
3 weapons with Identical mods;
---
* TSE, 90% reduced weight
---
* TS, + 50% Limb Damage
---
* Standard, Non Legendary
---
I found no deviation in recoil (Hip Fire or Aiming), and only a slight deviation in spread, with the TSE &amp; TS having greater spread while hip fired.
---
Who gives a shit though?
---
Pot meet kettle. 
---
Come on, lad. There's no need to get all butthurt about a simple comment on Reddit.
---
I'm sorry that you didn't notice that the name I gave was a joke, though. Hey, you'll get there eventually, don't worry. Just keep practicing.
---
Lead belly only reduces rads when u consume water I thought.  Besides why are you collecting water when you can have a water farm at a workshop active for a while and have plenty of purified water.
---
Please and Thanks
---
Why are you even picking up dirty water? The game throws purified at you. I have like 56 and I'm lvl 17.... 
---
In general it is a bad idea to settle around white springs. It‚Äôs a hotspot for endgame players that nuke the area and bring high level enemies with them 
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I used to play Neverwinter mmorpg on Xbox. For the big updates, they had a special test server for some PC players to play on, before the official release, to hunt down issues. The server was closed, and the progress/items wouldn't carry over to the actual game. Some bugs still got through, however, it helped them smooth out the launch. At this point Bethesda may NEED something like this, with live players doing the tests before launch. The updates would probably be delayed a bit, but at least be worth it 
---
Well isn't someone a little passive aggressive.
---
This is always one of the first things I do when I load into a game. "Well, let's check to see how much food I need to cram down before it spoils!"
---
BREAKING NEWS: NASA has decided to use a new time standard they call the '76' standard, in which all clocks within the building and in their satellites are set relative to how often Fallout 76 fucks up, proving to be more accurate a measurement of time than the current standard for accommodating for GPS time relative drift.
---
Never noticed, guess my luck has run out now. Thanks for that. 
---
Same here.  It's an engine hoist. 
---
Except it doesn't Daisy has the same page as a normal Fatman it just weighs 90% less
---
&gt; What if the new patch has exploits? Then only the testers will have access to a patch with exploits and people will use them
---
That's why you'd copy your save over to the test build to test it, and it's destroyed when the test is over. That's basically how Diablo III's PTR works.
---
I‚Äôve hated every g**damn 706 hrs I‚Äôve played come on Bethesda get your shit together 
---
This, but with Enclave, BoS, and Raiders. Or the other factions, Sons of Dane, Responders, Firetooters. 
---
Bullshit
---
&gt;Technically swimming is safe from diseases
---
Technically, you're wrong, because as others have said, even being ankle deep gives you a disease. 
---
What is broken stealth wise is the combination of the chameleon mutation and the Escape Artist perk. With both active, it‚Äôs easy to make your character ‚Äòappear‚Äô permanently invisible no matter what you do (in combat, fast traveling, even switching servers), but you don‚Äôt appear invisible to any other players. There are multiple ways I know to activate this and it‚Äôs been there since launch. Obviously a bug and not a useful one, please fix this! 
---
Let this chad of a gamer play the game.
---
One of the vendors has them, I bought them from Watoga station I think. It's been a few days.
---
You know. With all the flak melee gets. It takes a lot more than just a weapon.
---
Reading though this thread "Unyielding armor, adrenal reaction, perks that increase str (radicool and etc.), chems and food buffs(glowing meat specifically)."
---
Just for melee. I mean. Thats a lot of shit. For my commando/guerilla character ALL I need is a mehish gun. I use a auto pipe pistol, auto 10mm pistol and a combat rifle {furious}. No issue what so ever in my game play. I also don't need any buffs and the only mutations I need are solely for QOL vs combat .. such as marsupial.
---
I mean, call for a nerf if ya want. I just don't see the need due to the cost of investment to not just be killed at 10 hp with the bloodied build.
---
Because you can't cook with purified water. The point I'm trying to make is that I can equip two perks that completely eliminate my radiation damage from water, even if I'm submerged or consuming it. So what sense does it make that collecting it gives me rad damage? 
---
I usually have over 90+ purified on me and keep my boiled in my stash for cooking. I have sun kissed so I'll stand in a puddle and collect dirty water till I'm over weight, boil it and throw it in my stash for cooking. 
---
I have NO IDEA why you can elect to cook with purified water but I guess it's just too complicated for them.
---
The silo has a cooldown.
---
yup!!! ha only wish i noticed it before lvl 65 
---
I have the animal friend perk maxed but only gives the option to pacify, I‚Äôm guessing because my build budget is maxed.
---
Upvoting 
---
My main and alt use PA. but Considering ditching or scrapping lower levels of PA for stash space.
---
if I ditch some lucky lowbie is gonna be pretty happy!
---
Duhhhh If you read my post (yes I'm the OP you're referring to) I want incentive to go back to the western area of the map, no beat the same area over and over again, which at level 250+, I've done and redone. 
---
And I certainly don't want to waste nukes on zones with terrible loot.
---
Yeah I saved and saved and finally, after 5000 candy!  A junkie's Crossbow....
---
Shhhh!  we don't talk about this one, else it will go away.
---
But this one does prove the point that people are not getting banned from having crafted a few too many of some item, I personally make around 30 Marine Tactical Helmets every day.
---
PC will always be significantly more powerful than any console period. It's not the limitation of the games so much as it is the limitation of the hardware you are playing on. You get what you pay for and that's why PC is more expensive.
---
Yeah some are like you and seem to see a damage increase, but some people are saying the damage numbers don't go up after removing/reapplying. 
---
No, I think any fallout fan knew it would be full of bugs out the gate.  Rather play in while it‚Äôs a work in progress then not at all.  I got a full world to explore, loot to hoard and get to share the experience with others.
---
Nice thanks 
---
Congrats.
---
yea this.... This has got to be the most aggrevating thing ever. Twice now, I've gone and bulked all my items I could only to immidiately go to a bench adn click scrap all before storing just in case I missed a junk item. Boom all the plastic and time I just used. gone...
---
You know you can mute them, right?
---
I was worried about this issue and I looked into last night when I got home from work. What a coincidence that I had literally just started my bloodied build the night before the patch rolled out, so I already knew what my damage numbers were supposed to be on my weapons upon entering the game. 
---
So, I logged in last night and I can confirm that the Pip-Boy is definitely only showing the negative aspect of the mutation. What's weird, though, is that my damage numbers are still identical to what they were before Patch 6 even though it's not listing the positive effects in my Pip-Boy. I didn't remove the adrenal reaction mutation at all, just logged in and checked my numbers before and after equipping my weapons. The numbers before equipping my weapons were lower than the values that showed up after equipping them and they matched up with what I was expecting to see based on my previous night's numeric values.
---
I'll also note that I didn't have rad worms upon logging in last night. To see if that made a difference, I went and acquired said disease from Whitesprings. My numbers before and after removing the disease were as expected, too.
---
That said, for me at least, it seems like this issue is strictly one related to what's displayed in the Pip-Boy. Is it possible that's the case for you folks, too? Give my method a shot and see if you notice a difference. If not, I really hope that they fix this soon because it's definitely not cool!
---
My .50 Cal build begs to differ. Also, the new meta is VATS/Sniper with the Chameleon mutation and Weightless armor, at least if Reddit is to be believed. 
---
It's art. Just take it as such, lol.
---
The only times I've ever seen the mothman was at Whitesprings.
---
You're sticking your head in the alligator's mouth and complaining that it bit you.
---
OP knows and just wanted to bait people.
---
I laughed.
---
If you're cool with people selling in game items for real world money then I guess it's a good idea.
---
A "OOPS" emote would be cool.
---
They already have a test client - you're playing on it, along with everyone else.
---
I opened a shop. Traded with over 90 unique visitors last sunday. By thursday i was banned -_-
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Lol same thing happened to me. I killed a ghoul on the BOS third floor section and instead of just dying and falling over, it kept walking and legit walked straight through a wall into oblivion. 
---
Not so for me.  Double check your perks, make sure you still have any weight reduction ones equipped you may have had before.
---
Were you using Radworms to boost a STR effect?  They fixed the Radworms bug (I know my carry weight went from 305 to 325 when affected by Radworms prior to the patch.
---
My Power Armors (Excavator with 2x Calibrated and Motion Assist) and X01 with just 1 Calibrated appear to be working as intended.
---
 this is something entirely different.
---
I have general problem with Lever in VATS - it‚Äôs inaccurate af in point blank shots. Switch back from VATS to normal mode - enemy dead.
---
Great update! However, after installing the new update I just got a few bugs I never had before. Maybe they're already known to some of you but they were firsts for me.
---
\- Character freezes after gesture. It keeps repeating the gesture. Unable to move.
---
\- Black screen with just the HUD showing after fast traveling in Power Armor. Not possible to get out of it, unless you quit the game and restart it. Just switching servers won't do the trick. 
---
\- Unable to select entire structure in C.A.M.P for blueprint (it shows a green glow around the building but isn't actually selected).
---
\- Spinning wheel of death (loading circle) in C.A.M.P whilst creating blueprint. Got out of it by running away from my camp.
---
No one knows or cares about some bootleg polygon wannabe do yourself a favor and take a break from youtube
---
Then you'd have to provide some sort of incentive to play the test build. Otherwise there's no point at all to test their game for them. Again, if they can't test properly, the answer is not recruiting players to test their game, it's hiring more testers.
---
Turns out it's a stat boost telling me I've got a better chance of seeing the mothman.
---
I figured as much, but not sure how... Voice chat mode -none? Voice volume 0?
---
Saw the heart in the beginning. If he wasn‚Äôt grieving then he makes a great asshat.

I would like to get a chance to acquire the Blackbird paints, too. I've been playing since the Beta but I guess I was on vacation when that paint dropped in the Atom Store. It's hands down my favorite power armor paint job.
---
I totally understand that it was limited time only and I would be fine with having to wait for it to come around again, although I can only hope I don't miss out on it again next time! Yes, it's rare and those of you who have obtained it should enjoy that prestige for a good while. Maybe make all limited time offers available to everyone after a year of having been obtainable in the first place, as others have suggested?
---
I died at my camp while crafting from random unknown damage sources. It keeps going on for no reason (unyielding build)
---
People WANT to test. People are begging to test. I agree that more internal testers would be nice but it's pretty standard for online games to have test servers.

The creature needs to be half your level to tame.
---
Ah well ok then your argument is now completely understandable. Except. That's what nukes are for. If using them as intended isn't enough for you... Well... Don't go there. Bethesda needs to make nukes work better so that all nuke zones are better. Still doesn't change the fact that what you are asking for is in game with nukes. Lol
---
Turn you lights off
---
Nope. I was having an issue launching the game. I put in a support ticket yesterday morning and had a response a few hours later. Heres the key, I was polite, had a real technical issue and wasn‚Äôt demanding.  Im sure many people are just whiny little bitches with bullshit ‚Äúits not fair‚Äù complaints. I would ignore those too. 
---
Better ask another rank imo
---
Cheers mate -)) Hope you'll like 'em!
---
Presumably for cooking?
---
Haha thanks for this, this morning :)
---
happened to me a few times when i got the game but like once its happened in a month.
---
playing at 4k hasnt changed, its hot trash, they need to fix that shit ASAP.
---
No. I can still lay waste to melee in PVP. They deserve to one shot me if they can find me. 
---
Note - I also have a 70+ bloodied melee alt and while I can one shot most things, PVP is frustrating as hell unless the person is dumb enough to just stand there. It might also have to do with knowing how easy it is on my VATS-crit-spammer main.
---
Ooo whitesprings and surrounding area isn‚Äôt great for a camp if your lvl 17 tbh, high traffic of high level players and if your near the cliff the other side of the lookout you might find a SB turns up an destroys your camp, happened to me a couple weeks after I settled there. On the plus side if you kill the mothman his wing fragments are made of ballistic fibre
---
That's what gets me with this fuxking company. You leave exploits in the game for months without even addressing them or addressing possible consequences if people dont stop doing it. And then when the time comes they just start banning people who took advantage of it and some who possibly didn't. They should have addressed issues instead of staying silent about them.  I'm honestly shocked people still play this game. Well, after these ban waves maybe they wont. Lol
---
He is right though.
---
Beth said multiple times explicitly that there would only be STRICTLY cosmetic items in the ATOM shop. That has turned out to be false.
---
Ok, it's only +15 HP now but once they see that ppl buy that shit more since they get an additional effect with it, they will just introduce more and more such items with more gameplay altering effects.
---
This is a slippery slope and he is right to point it out.
---
You can be outraged all you want but these are just facts. Also, if you don't like it, don't watch it.
---
What's the point of testing if all your progress there is not accounted for at the end. There's no incentive at all man. People that want to test are not going to want to test if it means not saving any progress they make there. What incentive do I have to test their game for them? 
---
Sad that you have nothing better to do than bitch and moan about an "awful game" you "put down months ago". 
---
I run unyielding and have random loss of HP as well, it's strange 
---
Anyone having more than one account, should likely have several chars in each. Having two accounts one char each makes no sense.
---
Personally I can't really say. Swapping ammo back and forth doesn't make sense. In his later post where he was prevented from playing and probably knew he was banned, he showed his build.
---
His build had no ammo weight perk.
---
Yet on his previous posts he said he had. That's 2 special investment, out of your 50. That lack of perk seemed more like made up explonation for swapping ammo back and forth between chars.
---
Also would you farm absurd amount of ammo if you aren't using that much of it. Earlier posts a month ago, he had pretty high amount of .38 utracite, like 32k or something. Doable maybe, but requires quite farming. If you are farming, why are you farming the least effective ammo. I've crafted that with my extra flux because it was too slow to sell it, and I wanted to free some weight. But that amount he had on screenshot, requires quite farming for raw flux, it doesn't come from SBQ.
---
Yet, I've seen someone saying get got banned while the emain listed only 270k plastic. 270k seems a lot, but only plastic. No one would dupe only plastic. And several traders have said they were banned, which most I would trust what they say.
---
It's really hard to know what to think.
---
I do the confused question marks emote, repeat it if they turn towards me, and then add a heart. I have always been forgiven.
---
It‚Äôs sad that you have nothing better do do than bitch and moan about what I said üòÇ
---
Most of us have made that mistake, once, if you find it's happening more than that then you still haven't learned from the expensive lesson.
---
Asking for a change like this is comparable to saying, "Don't let others take my junk in a blast Zone", the lesson there is Don't take your Junk into a Blast Zone.
---
Oh no. It was a mess at launch. Heck, patches removed "extra" NPCs for stability for a while. 
---
But they patched like mad. FO76 patches are ridiculously glacial in their pacing.
---
Then what is his problem? Yong is stating a FACT, not a conspiracy. The OP's post is a perfect reflection of the game, a shit show.
---
Then explain how every Blizzard title has successful test servers where progress doesn't transfer over? 
---
Gamers want their games to be good, so they want to help. Not everyone will, but that's fine.
---
Yes still happens to our team. Going try this work around, thanks u/tacticutie
---
It‚Äôs been reported. They just keep breaking things in the new patches...
---
Thankfully after my 2nd time I started to pay more attention to what I was doing. Painful lesson as I was always short of plastic. 
---
Preach on brother, the grind continues!

Just open your map, then the social menu; you can scroll down and select their user name, then mute/block from the drop down menu.

I've used it a couple times at SBQ's, don't really want to hear someone weezing into their mic for 20-30 minutes.
---
Ima give you an upvote

I could not care less.  
---
Yes. I killed 3 yesterday, love the death spaz-out animation. Dig the ballistic fiber too.

When I did it some time ago, I got a drill. Not a legendary drill, mind you. Just a drill. I'm not really sure if that was better or worse than some of the legendary options.
---
I was worried about this issue and I looked into last night when I got home from work. What a coincidence that I had literally just started my bloodied build the night before the patch rolled out, so I already knew what my damage numbers were supposed to be on my weapons upon entering the game.
---
It teaches you to learn to watch where you walk.
---
There are environmental stories everywhere, though. And creepy moth man/Lucky Hole mine shrines scattered around. If not for the enemies, for the fun of exploration.
---
Its cool man, YTers arent real people anyway.
---
Double checked all perks.  Did nothing special with rad storms and such.  The part that is puzzling me is when i put on Power Armor.   Weight jumps up 100Lbs.  This was a similiar issue with excavator armor issue we had a few month ago.  If you got out of the armor and back in again, you get a +100 lbs to weight.  If its just me, i will close down my computer and reboot.  Maybe something funny is going on in my scripts.
---
No what I'm saying is people don't get two builds. The game gives you the option to download the patch early (at your own risk rofl). As for exploits so what, like there has already been exploits in the game and people are playing it. They can just remove them before the official release comes. Its much better than downloading a patch then discovering your mutations don't work of you die randomly.
---
I don‚Äôt want to
---
Or you could do it like that.
---
Yep. If Lava in Minecraft taught me anything, it's be careful walking around the one thing you can't get your stuff back if you die. 
---
I don't recall ever saying that. All i said was if you're carrying 100k's of items dont be surprised if you get banned. Were you the guy that got butthurt trying to convince us that you can legitimately have that much shit? olololl
---
Dont you have to use the wall inside out for it to be usable though? I really wanted a keypad door, but the pad is on the inside and im just not ready to entertain such bad design lol.
---
Wear a mask next time so your face doesn't scare him off. 
---
Naw on PC sadly.
---
Thank u guys üëç these things are nice reading for us not so smart with numbers ( talking about myself)
---
Boring.
---
Veey cool!
---
I wonder in this case if there are situations when one shot hits snd the other misses? Or it‚Äôs always both hit/miss.
---
My first experience with one was the texture glitched and remained there. So he wasnt targetable or anything but easy to take pictures with.
---
THANKS!
---
Yes: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asmek8/after_patch_thoughts/
---
I had something similar earlier in the game, also at one point had a -4 phantom weight decrease.  Unequip all armor and Class Freak, exit game through menu, reload and reequip worked at the time.
---
Well, When I go back to the newbie area there is plenty of pure water, not so much in the badlands. But with sunkissed and way too many radaways, I can drink from pretty much anything and the rads will be gone in seconds. I mostly collect and boil water to make drinks. I only need purified for meds crafting. When you get high enough to go to whitesprings, you get free disease cure  as well from a water source (still gives you rads).
---
I got two outright bans on accounts I hadn't played in over a two weeks.  That's a ban wave.
---
Oof 11k. I need to up my game.just under 5k here. I've spent a few thousand though I suppose.
---
I've encountered maybe 5, 1 of which I was able to kill the rest vanished. Same thing seems to happen with Flatwoods Monster.
---
Thank you 
---
sure ya did buddy. 
---
The ones I found pre patch only had one cap
---
I‚Äôve always found it uses the minimum level that you actually need dependant on how much health you‚Äôre missing.
---
Ah, not just me then.
---
Thanks :)
---
That is very cool!
---
I will try.  Thanks.
---
I can't wait to hit level 25 so I can get it for myself

np man.

I‚Äôll take my face over yours all day.  But I‚Äôll stop bringing your picture along with me as a means of scaring those monsters off üòÇ
---
Man, that's too bad.  Maybe it's just the resoltuion.  I'm playing at 1080p and things are just so much more responsive.  I'm not just talking about smoother frame rates, but interacting with containers and workbenches are magnitudes faster.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I don't disagree with you on the point that this should not be deemed Fallout 5 by fans or equated to the single player titles, but the general fanbase I expect will want a solidly built single player experience. I think it's important that they cater to both audiences and I do think they are slowly trying to achieve that goal. As per usual, this game was released before it was ready, as if often the case with AAA titles these days unfortunately. 
---
However, I will say that people who only want the PVP experience are likely to get that joy in other games as well, so it's difficult to pinpoint the target audience. On your note of more challenging titles, I tried Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, and I found myself not enjoying them. For me, I like a narrative more than the challenge. Can I handle the challenge? Yes, but not without some frustration, and it won't give me the satisfaction of achievement that so many people get from accomplishing their goals in such games. When I was younger I'd revisit games to beat them on hard and very hard. Now, I don't bother because I just want the narrative. Given that, and the lack of direction in the two titles mentioned, I ended up leaving both games quite early on as they were too unforgiving and I didn't enjoy that.
---
How does that come back to Fallout? Simply because I want to be able to enjoy the world and the gameplay and my own goals and the narrative on my own time and at my own pace. I don't want to be randomly bombarded by someone else who enjoys the game differently interrupting that experience. If someone comes in to help me take out an event, great. If we are exploring the same building, great. If we are all at SBQ, great. But if you are killing me or griefing me, not great. I'm all for cooperative, all against PVP, and it'd be nice to be given some sort of mechanism to manage that. As it stands, the true mechanism of avoiding pvp is... well, to not play. Right?

Hey u/LoneVaultWanderer, I thought I'd pass on my comments added to other related posts.

**TL;DR = for me, this is merely a display issue within the Pip-Boy and my numbers are identical to pre-Patch 6**:
---
Hey at least I am not scarin them off with my looks :p I just get the glitched ones i can take pics with.

Yea increase to a monster spawn does not a better game make
---
Could be a Maple Leaf
---
Or add filters.
---
Haven't touched my PC account in ages, but on PS4 this didn't happen at all last two weekends, though I did experience it farther back.  I have still had the bug where your teammate shows up naked, though, and messed up player geometry if you're leaving your power armor as your teammate is loading in.
---
I see what you did there
---
That's cool I knew the frame was there but did not know it could spawn the Raider I was going to have to farm an area I haven't been to yet near the Crosshairs I think is called. 
---
I'm in favor of it, but it would take an extraordinary long time I would guess for them to have to sort through every single item and retag it...
---
Are the plans to make nuka grape in the game?
---
Yeah even 1440 runs fairly smooth. But I play on my 4k tv hooked up to my pv. Usually every game runs fine but fo76 hitches like crazy
---
Hold up, what is a brain bomb?! I gotta look that up now I want to craft some.
---
Also 2 good places for Royal Jelly is the ‚ÄúFreak‚Äù raider camp and around the tree house. Good luck.
---
But I have that posh BOS officer boot going. Rated highly for post apocalyptic travel.

Happened to me a few days ago. Went for the queen who dropped into the fissure. I obviously died. I tried getting it back and while falling into the fissure i pressed X to access the bag. I didnt die and stood on the green stuff. I was so happy and surprised but i take it.

This is why you‚Äôre better hunting legendarys Off legendarys

Servers are more stable because they removed a TON of excess inventory and removed the turds responsible for it.

"I suck bethesdas **** and can't handle any criticism of the game even if it's entirely true."

Who said I was complaining about atom ingress? Okay sure we get atoms. Fact of the matter is we still have a store with over inflated prices in a $60 game. Sure it's less bad that we still earn atoms but it's still bad we havr to deal with hefty prices but sure, I'll humor you. 1000 a week? You're delusional. You get 150 from weekly and 50 daily (7 days). 500 a week if you don't miss a single challenge. There are other challenges but there is a hard cap of 4-5k points in general that you wont ever get again after that. You can't earn 1000 consistently and the further you progress in the game the harder and longer getting those atoms is. 
---
MTX funding devs? Ok... then how do the devs for CDPR do it? How do the Naughty Dog devs do it? How do the Insomniac devs do it? How do Guerrila Games get by without MTX? However could that be? 
---
Man, I'm not even going to argue you defending the CC. The whole thing just disgusts me. They're still MTX in a single player game WHICHEVER way you look at it.

Lol I know. Can't believe they make mistakes we paid money so I expect them to flawlessly code everything. I mean what are they humans???
---
I'm not banned why should I be butthurt. Did you not read the posts showing the math that it is possible? And pooling stuff together isn't legitimate now? Have fun begging on here. 
---
I am not banned banned but my account is suspended and I can still log into Bethesda page with my account, do I do that as well to recover my account? Idk if that counts through in-game really need help 
---
I‚Äôve killed 3 star enemies that don‚Äôt drop any legendary loot and that‚Äôs a fucking shame.
---
Its fucked up. People want to turn the whole CDPR GOOD into a meme and call it a circlejerk but really- they have set an example of good consumer practices. It's plausable but devs are becoming lazy and want to crash the industry with all this nickle and diming.
---
Yeah. That's what I meant. Kind of like when crafting you can only display things you can craft.
---
I played last night with no disconnects and no crashes and I can put some of my alternate ammunition guns and some decent legendaries to sell in my stash and still have plenty of room for a reasonable amount of junk for repairs later. It'll take a little bit to scavenge enough junk to overfill my stash again
---
Some guys made a mod that sorts out everything for you and calculates what every specific part of the inventory weights[Nexusmods better inventory FO76](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) 
---
I'm also interested in knowing this. I may have to do the test myself. Don't know if I'll ever make it back here to report my findings however. 
---
I did the math you‚Äôve presented and what you‚Äôve just said does not add up 
---
There are 2 Items labeled Royal Jelly; The Junk Item that drops from the Honeybeasts on occasions, and the Aid Item which only one can be found located behind Middle Mountain Cabins in a small basket next to a grave marked with a note. It is the only way to make Black Berry Crisps and Royal Jelly Taffy. So far I have acquired 15 Royal Jelly Taffy from daily raids on the basket as it respawns every day. You'd be better off with Can Do as you can get Canned Coffee which restores 200 AP and Canned Dog Food. They're much more plentiful and less likely to run out.
---
I understand your point, I'm saying that the benefits are so minor it's not worth them trying to recode the game to prevent grouping, not when more impactful things exist to PVP.  The real issue is being outnumbered. 
---
At best, they are using empathy and all sharing a perk.  I don't feel that whatever perks they share, in a PVP scenario, are even close to the impact of using Lone Wanderer (which they can do if they team up without teaming), assassins gear, and sentinels gear. 
---
Those traps are still going to exist, and in fact will be easier to pull off in an always on PVP server.  
---
pc?
---
I don‚Äôt think they would allow people to make their own tapes. Free speech is a thing but it‚Äôs not hard to imagine people going way too far. Maybe they could allow players to create quests though. Request an item and select a reward to give. I think it would be difficult to do anything more than fetch quests but it would be a good addition 
---
You think they are competent enough to have a separate client for fo76? How much more frequently would they roll squashed bugs back into live if they had to manage 2 different versions.
---
they said over and over that this isnt a traditional fallout game.
---
do research next time. 
---
Love it! Check [these clips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCbWUGGTvBiwzWZEg06l0w) out...

Found a bag with \~750k lbs of junk in it. I'm very sure it came from someone doing the duping (because how the F do you get that much of it right?) but I didnt/ have not ever done the duping glitch. As soon as I even heard of that glitch I stayed very far away from it. But lets be honest here its a game about post-apocalypse, must use resources, must farm resources and must struggle to survive. When you find a bag with an A-load of Aluminum, Steel, Springs, gears, Copper, Ultracite, Oil and everything else you'd ever need to never struggle in the game again, why wouldn't you pick it up? Also which item of junk is considered "Rare". I mean I guess from the perspective of "you're supposed to struggle for these resources" but none of them are like TSE Mini-gun rare. (thats my bar for rare because i want one and have not found it)
---
But hey F-it right? Im just a "Duper" according to Bethesda and to the keyboard cowboys. 
---
Right but my point as pointed out, is that they are duping tons of stuff, breaking it down and using that to make ammo they do use.
---
Up until the last update that limited char carry weight, a mule could hold unlimited weight. There were some reports of players with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stuff on a single char.
---
No one cares if they are duping ammo or duping other stuff and scraping for the parts to make ammo, which also gives then exp.
---
The issue is that under normal gameplay people can't or won't have hundreds of thousands of bullets of multiple ammo types, in a 30 day period.
---
Life Hack: enemies can't climb stairs.
---
it sounds like your internet fucked up.

Overwatch literally already has this, a separate place to test out the new patch.  The incentive is getting to try out the new stuff before it goes live so you get more practice and can know the maps sooner.
---
A friend duped a bunch of stuff for me and now my stash is broken and I just want out. 
---
Sorry I shoulda put xbone

He was mulling. And you dont know what a fact is. 
---
It was for one week, I wouldn‚Äôt consider a temporary incentive a p2w advantage.
---
Besides, this was two weeks ago and he‚Äôs only covering it now for some reason.
---
Possible if you have no life and spent every waking hour at it maybe, but nobody did that.
---
bonerstrike
---
No, he was mulling. Aka passing on over items from 1 character to another. You dont need 2 accounts to dupe. 
---
No. I am sorry I didn't mean to imply that. I think the cammo pattern on the urban scout armor more closely matches the pattern on the BoS fatigues (underarmor).

I think the shielded upgrade is different between the two. I seem to remember them updating different special attributes. I am not online so I can't look.

I (like most Fallout fans) expect there will be. I have no knowledge of such so it is just conjecture.

This is awesome.

I mean in Skyrim dropping gold and picking it back up adds to total gold earned stat. I wouldn't put it beneath Bethesda to just record additions/shots fired.

Haha it could be fun nonetheless

What if you went commando in your bathrobe? You could be the creepy uncle of the wasteland. Just need to add a Fatal Attraction leg uncross emote to complete the look

I got tired of Yong veeerrrrry quickly when he started churning out 10 minute videos, 5-7 minutes of which were him reading someone else's article, or even worse, a bunch of tweets or reddit posts. It's fucking lazy and these "content creators" only do it to get a second ad on their videos.   
---
Laymen are a little better, but maybe I'm biased being Australian and all. I also respect Ralph a lot for his Skillup content.
---
It is systematic that they brake something in every patch.
---
There are lots of people who have hundreds of hours on 76 because they are on long term leave, some medical. So does that mean they do not have a life? Guy with 900 hours did say he was on medical leave due to a recent surgery. 
---
Yeah sure. That's also why I'd like to go there more often. The zones (especially the forest zone) is pleasing visually and, as you said, there's some fun exploration to do 
---
It starts with a temporary incentive then it goes to permanent. Why do you think they introduced temporary incentives? To sell more items. How will they be able to sell even more? Offer permanent advantages.
---
Hopefully it won't happen because the community shows enough push back that Beth won't implement these but it usually starts like this... 
---
Yeah, dude, don't stop believing! Or maybe try it for yourself first ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I feel the same way....there's a perk card can't think of it now...that decreases disease chance from environment I was going to give a try

Ha ha ha, he deleted the post just as I was about to read it. It was that bad?

Laughed at this, then realized how upsetting it is...
---
wow. I have to say I never envisioned myself visiting West Virginia. After this game, I probably will have to rent a room at the Whitesprings.
---
That would be too cool. We can't have that kind of coolness in game.
---
So this post gains an F-load of attention and Bethesda buries it. What a great company. I wanted to work for you guys at one point. So glad I dont now. Couldn't imagine being attached to this colossal of screw up. 
---
What does PSA mean ? I see this everywhere on this reddit
---
There was a guy yesterday who was saying that Bethesda needed to lay people off for these mistakes. I disagreed.
---
If they have an open window near a work bench you can activate the work bench from it. This places you in the camp without getting wanted.

Next update?

I want to do it just because their tourism board is embracing the tie in.  I can't imagine their job being easy all the time.

great suggestion.

since we're on the subject if we're splitting up, i want outfits/armors! im tired of scrolling through my dozens of golf outfits to get to my chassis and pretty much anything else i wear.

It‚Äôs not an insult. It‚Äôs a fact from observation. If I say something and someone comes out of left field with something unrelated, or just asininely wrong, they obviously didn‚Äôt read and just commented to comment. Which happens quite a lot here. I posted a specific question the other day here, and three of 4 people just commented random unrelated things. 
---
Not my fault people either can‚Äôt read or can‚Äôt comprehend, and always need the last word on something. I don‚Äôt have time to suffer fools.

Look broham, nothing you say is going to convince me anyone legitimately farmed over 100k of anything on this game. Unless you have solid proof, sit down and shut up.

tl;dw: Equip head. Drop all fusion cells. Pick all fusion cells back up. Issue is resolved. Load cells with the reload button up to 5 times. Fire with 1 to 5 cells loaded.
---
Even fixed, it's still garbage. And a fully charged proper shot gives you +49 rads and the damage is still crap.
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug get out a melee weapon and start swinging away until get a hit marker. Seems to me they visually appear underground but still maintain a hit marker above. Or just run as far away as possible or get near some turrets they will usually take care of what you can‚Äôt see. 
---
People give me stuff all the time. Maybe if the grind wasn't so awful I wouldn't need to ask. :D I'm sure I'll pay it forward after lvl 50.
---
Probably because I've built a rifleman character and using melee is still significantly easier. I don't have to manage ammo, carry only the one weapon and it does significantly more damage than any of my rifles even though I have 0 melee damage perks. 
---
need to delete that weapon
---
Nah, the damage is definitely way less.
---
I couldn't agree more! Overall, I think the patch was a success. I am honestly loving the game as it is now, but if we keep on getting patches that improve the game (without breaking big things, or undoing old fixes) and some good DLC, this could end up being an amazing game before too long.
---
But... why do you all need NPC ? 
---
What do you expect them to bring ? 
---
The quest won't be able to permanently affect the gamestate anyway, because of the multiplayer nature. Which means you will only have "small actors" npc with fedex quests.
---
What's the point ?
---
Dont worry about it man. It was only a matter of time before you got banned anyway for being too good at the game. 
---
Thanks, that helped !
---
This patch kinda sucked actually. Haven't you been reading about all the bugs introduced? 
---
At least you can scrap it for a scrapped head, and then scrap the scrapped head for a chance at the Assaultron helmet plans!
---
Plus, after scrapping, they give a handful of useful junk.
---
"People give me stuff all the time." Still comes on reddit to beg. 11/10.
---
Yaaaaaaaassssss
---
It‚Äôs such a shame, I just got the mutation a day or so ago. I hope it‚Äôs fixed soon. 
---
Thanks for the feedback. I can start grinding now !
---
I'm very sorry to hear that! :(
---
Not at all.  A sufficiently large random string that gets created on item generation adds one line to the activity, at the expense of a tiny bit of storage (or a couple lines to only tag legendaries, with largely reduced storage).  
---
Nothing *needs* to be done with those strings, but they're available to check in the database as needed.  A bit more overhead could automate some real-time checks for duping, but in reality that can just be checked manually as needed.
---
I'm a bit familiar with how that's been implemented on other games, in much higher traffic and population games.
---
Yes. Plus a bunch of server and client optimization/performance.
---
I submitted a support ticket on Bethesda page, idk how to delete the ticket but if I close it will they still be able to see it somehow or no? Like idk if they can open it and see it old how close tickets work 
---
It would definitely be nice to have some lock feature on certain items. You can't scrap legendaries already, so surely they can apply the same mechanics for us to decide which we do not want scrapping. 
---
I scrapped my X01 power armour and a set of shielded underarmour to that curse. Both times when my power armour was recalled to my inventory and shifted my apparel list down one :-(
---
It does annoy me a bit when people push the 'no story' crap. It's not hard to find but they've skipped most the content and say it's not there. It doesn't spoon feed you everything, so they rush and miss it.
---
As a side note (not *story* as such) last night I noticed the asylum showers have lots of rope, a couple of straight jackets and a camera in there... what was happening in the showers exactly? *Please don't answer that: I already have some horrible ideas.*
---
This is why we need high level servers. No enemies would spawn below a level 50 and you have to be lvl 50 or above to play on them.
---
As someone who lives in Pittsburgh, I've never had a bad trip to West Virginia. Tubing down the Shenandoah River is a great time - there's a huge stretch of it that's clear and about 4 feet deep that's great for it.
---
Hopefully you jumped on Bridge Day in October since it's illegal any other time of the year!
---
When I was a kid I watched this older guy have a heart attack and die while doing the jump. Now that I'm married and definitely more fit for jump, I still wont do it. I've got 2 dogs and a lady to take care of.
---
[Hiking around that area is great though](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dz2peP7W0AAYIka.jpg:large)
---
There could be a bulletin or "message board" on the trainstations with a dropbox for some fetch, requests quests and trades. Would probably have to be instanced across all servers
---
I definitely have seen some complaints, as well as some people with nothing but positive things to say about the update. For me, the only noticable difference has been an increased stash size, and a much, much more stable client.
---
My first build was a rifleman build on PS4 but when I went to PC, I found out how hard and frustrating it was for melee. It's a real bitch when you are getting shot at and you have to jump off something, or try to find the right way to get around something so you can actually reach the enemy. Even worse when they are just chilling on a catwalk above like at Poseidon energy plant. seriously fucking annoying having six of them just sitting there shooting you repeatedly while you have to run all the way up to the top just to hit them with a hammer once. 
---
Yeah, it does more damage, but much, much less DPS if you actually look at DPS. You can't do damage if you can't even reach them
---
It's still broken. Happened to us last night. I had to relog to see my team mate. 
---
mine is already full.  i think i have a problem.
---
That would be really cool
---
I think you're full of shit 
---
Maybe I will launch a Nuke it seems stable !!
---
Are you programmer or engineer by trade? 
---
Never had that problem. I always eliminate an enemy then take cover to find out where they are before I rush to engage. 
---
they could roll up in those APC trucks we'd see all over Fo4 as they wouldn't have the Prydwen yet.
---
Because my rifleman build can one hit anything with melee. It‚Äôs f*cking op!
---
Damn, really?  What happened?  I was able to play it last night, and other people were there playing too.  I sleep for a few hours, wake up, and now it's broken and dead?  WTF?  
---
No we cant. Mothman got banned for being too good at the game. He's still in the appeals process in Charleston waiting for his number to be called. Doesn't matter anyway. As soon as he does get to the window im sure he wont have what the clerk needs to help him out. Anyone else experience this?
---
the junk extractor and river gives away your location entirely, i know exactly where that location is.  Im not going to disclose any info about my best camp spots.  my location near the monorail with a junk extractor would be in use by another player at least 1/3 of the time i joined a server.  same with the lead/junk extractor location, and most of the 2 extractor locations i detailed in my on post months ago. that was my mistake, wont happen again.  having to keep jumping servers to be able to place ur camp is a pain, when u've played more hours maybe you will understand.  
---
So was mine initially but then I cleaned up a lot I didn‚Äôt need. Like I didn‚Äôt need 25 fusion cores üòØ
---
Pathetic, I had 8 mothmen on my tail during a hunter/hunted  event
---
XD
---
Events that guarantee 3 stars like awol, sbq, sons of dane, census, etc.
---
TS is not just +25% damage, but shoot a second bullet with 25% damage of the first bullet.
---
I played for seems about six and a half hours straight yesterday with no disconnections or crashes. Didn't do any Queen runs or fight any scorchbeasts during it but there was a white Springs run. No stuttering no lag no issues really whatsoever other than the bodies still occasionally dropping through the floor before you can loot them. Xbox One X, smooth as I've ever seen it.
---
It was on simething I read to figure this out. Mentioned the armor. I only saw the launcher. Thanks 
---
The only thing on melee i think needs to be done is make it so the high damage melee builds dont entirely destroy power armor in one hit so power armor is actually has a chance in pvp
---
This was an issue before the patch as well. I have born survivor and it was wasting all my stimpacks. The perk actually couldn't keep up after the patch and it killed me twice in a row. I sever hoped and that seem to resolve the issue. I don't run unyielding and was in power armor. This needs to be fixed though.  Seems to always happen to me in or around white springs.
---
This is really cool! 
---
Nah dude, no reason to.
---
its broken for me as well. they run across a large area to attack me while im in stealth.
---
A **fact** is a thing that is known to be consistent with objective [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality) and can be proven to be true with [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence). For example, "this sentence contains words" is a [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic) fact, and "the sun is a star" is a [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological) fact. Further, "[Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln) was the 16th President of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)" and "Abraham Lincoln was assassinated" are also both facts, of the [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History) type. All of these statements have the [*epistemic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic) *quality* of being "[ontologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontologically) superior" to [opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion) or interpretation ‚Äî they are either categorically necessary or supported by adequate historical documentation.
---
Conversely, while it may be both consistent and true that "most cats are cute", it's not a fact (although in cases of opinion there is an argument for the acceptance of popular opinion as a statement of [common wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wisdom), particularly if ascertained by [scientific polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_polling)). Generally speaking, facts transcend [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) and serve as [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_and_concrete)descriptions of a [state of affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_affairs_(philosophy)) on which beliefs can later be assigned.
---
The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability ‚Äî that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience). Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [Scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiments) or other means.
---
I do indeed need those 25 fusion cores!  They go so fast when you wear power armour 24/7!   I hate having to farm them every time i play. 
---
Who cares what you think? You‚Äôre nobody to me. At least I‚Äôm not insulting people online by calling them names. And the alarm thing would actually be nice, I could have a nice breakfast and watch some tv. I set my alarm for the last minute so it‚Äôs always a mad dash to get up and out of the house.
---
Hey, I didn't think positive posts were allowed in this sub
---
Definitely visit Fayetteville while you‚Äôre here in West Virginia. That town represents WV way better than Lewisburg does. 
---
Why not recommend it on the "dev"(?) stream in a few days? I don't see how that stream could go wrong...
---
I will try again tonight. It got late and did not want to.do it over again and ended up getting slaufhtered by a gulper. üòÇ
---
NO, really ?! And why even bring Arma up ?
---
And stalking Mothman.
---
I've encountered him five times so far, four of those at my camp.   He wouldn't get off my lawn so I filled him full of lead.    Mothman had the last laugh though.   After he died he left a glowing pile of crap behind on my lawn.     Bethesda we need a giant fusion powered bug zapper please!
---
Someone else has already mentioned this, perhaps its the type of Mothman that is spawning for you.   The odd time I ran into him when lower level he would always immediately fly away.   I am currently in my 90's and all these Mothmen definitely fight.
---
Yeah that would be good and bad, because if they get their wanted so high and have some caps but not enough, do they keep losing caps on each death and stay wanted. Like say they are 1k caps wanted and was able to kill some people, sell to vendors, find caps in the wild and have around 500 and then get killed. It would seem unfair for the person to kill the wanted not get any caps for wasting lead on them.
---
You are right, TOS do not have any legal baring. This isn't really a legal issue though. There are no laws protecting your access to a private companies server and they can and will ban you from using that service if they want too. A company isn't going to do that for no reason even if they can though, it's bad for business, just another OP is very likely guilty of what Bethesda claims.
---
the animations of them hanging from a tree, waiting is terrifyingly incredible. they will jump back up to get higher ground mid fight too even inside buildings. i want to tame one for my camp D:
---
Someone on Bethesda's board posted a screenshot of there email on a ban for over 100k of Plastic (only item listed on the email).
---
Eh thats not true I had 2 and still took slim amount of hp, were I could use a diluted stimpak to cover.
---
Yeah they should fire their game testers lol.
---
I think this is a good feature to add. Also, on top of the oops/Sorry emote, an option to send to the player accidentally hit to repeal the wanted level. I was by the munitions factory, taking out a vertibot when someone claimed the location as i was finishing up destroying it, and caused a wanted level and the gun turrets to take me out. 3 deaths later, and having to message the player who claimed the location off-game and finally he got his revenge. 
---
It would be nice to be able to repeal the wanted level if unwarranted or accidental. 
---
The incentive is a better game. 
---
Just read the patch notes. I haven't played in a while (too many other games was the main reason) but I'm excited to get home and play some tonight!
---
I have no clue why it's suddenly popped into my head. ü§îü§≠
---
I think Bethesda feels there is not enough raiders and attempting to make killing random people easier.
---
I'm getting same problem too any fix to this ?
---
PC 1080 AMD 1920x 32gb ram 4k
---
Yeah‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs also one spawning near Crosshairs in the raider camp.
---
One of the better patches imo.
---
It does not apply underarmor stats, no.
---
Keys on a keyring or something please
---
Not true, there are several things that break sentinels, that everyone has access to no matter what their choice of weapon.  Dumb TSE people just firing with no tactics... 
---
Lolz
---
That‚Äôs not a glitch, that‚Äôs a EXPLOIT.
---
you got an excavator PA without doing the miner miracles questline.
---
IF YOU HAD, you woulda got the plans to create.
---
If you completed the quest, you got the PA repair station.
---
Don‚Äôt call this a glitch. You cheated your way to the end AND NOW
---
Can‚Äôt repair or replace excavator.
---
Try duping..
---
Downvoting for whining.
---
Did you even read what I said or are you just disagreeing? If you are on the ground and they are up on the rooftop shooting at you, there's nothing you can do. You literally have to run to them... Rifle can just one shot them from the ground. 
---
As someone from Pennsylvania, can confirm, especially during early fall. 
---
Yeah, this was worse for my group in early February and we didn't have trouble with it last week, but there are still enough reports that it seems we just got lucky. 
---
Are you sure you removed it and got it again?
---
Brilliant 
---
Okay! Have an okay day! 
---
Great idea to capitalize on the game. A couple years ago the wife and I went to Boston and hit all kinds of locations from Fallout 4. Even took my Vault Boy Bobble-head with us to photograph at key landmarks. We had a great time. If 76 brings in some tourism to the area in West Virginia I think that's awesome. 
---
Rats, i was hoping it would lol
---
So, once you get it free, how do you get it to activate? I don't see it on the emote wheel, not even under the "expand" option for other emotes. Any tips? 
---
Maybe one off but when loading yesterday on two different occasions I got notified my camp couldn‚Äôt be placed.  It did ask if I wanted to try another server and clicked I yes but it just hung up both times and had to reload the game. 
---
nah. we need global and local chat.
---
Except they would probably ban the testers for finding the exploits.
---
temporary are WORSE than permanent. If there was just one hat that gave +15 HP and that was that then everyone could eventually earn it in game with earned atoms. If it's temp and everyone has to be constantly paying more and more money to stay up on the latest bonuses then the game really does get pay to win
---
Thank you for your service. F
---
Okay yes, but most people are reporting that if you remove it with radaway, then get it again, it works.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt you ask Bethesda instead of Reddit?
---
The current model of the game is to use paying customers as free labor and depend on support tickets to identify problems to fix.
---
Would be the most useful and versatile of all the emotes.
---
That Greenbrier looks so ridiculously amazing in the photos! 
---
I just farm for Power Armor. I was only level 25 and was searching for level 25 T45 . When you find any Armor it usually has a power core. So now in all my searching I have my T45 and T51b just missing a right leg for my T51b. They are super easy to get. I gave 7 cores to one guy on my team and 7 to the other. What platform you on?
---
Shhh
---
Okay salty! Lay off the salt it‚Äôs bad for your heart. Apex legends is waiting. Guess you‚Äôre getting destroyed in that game so you decided to insult people in this sub :) find something better to do salty. 
---
I love the idea of being quest givers. Maybe after level 100.
---
That's a nice crafting cost.  If they do "nerf" it, it will likely be to something similar as the Confederate Suit, which takes 1 Gold and some cloth to craft (and sells well, but Gold is considerably more rare than just cloth).
---
I haven't checked to see if I can make the hat.  I know I can make the Suit which I think I found in Helevtia back when I first started playing (they have a Civil War museum there, and I think I found the plans one day in that area, as well as suits/hats).
---
The Tesla rifle (and possibly others) trigger the bug since 1.5 that enemies heal their damage and all ranged weapons have no effect.
---
This was actually fixed with 1.3 or 1.4 so a fix for this bug should not be an effort. Why was not fixed with 1.6?
---
I'm more annoyed by the fact that there really isn't any reason to get the perk: There's not much water on the map, and what water there is doesn't act as an obstacle.
---
Fallout 4 had rivers everywhere(basically highways when you have aquaboy/girl) and a whole coastline, *and* Far Harbour was way easier if you could just swim everywhere.
---
Appreciate the Stash increase but servers were garbage last night, lag was the worst it has been since release.  Not that dupers are banned I hope they can look into the real reasons why server performance is so bad.
---
Sorry to hear that. Will test again with my wife soon. 
---
i was able to instantly know where OPs camp is because of 1 picture,  location and landmarks just make it easier.   the junk extractor by the river is a dead giveaway, just like many other visual clues that a photo would show.  I don't want to go into much detail, but how many treehouses with working radios and extractors do u think there are?  if i posted a photo u would be able to find my treehouse because of the map of extractor locations.  if i didn't show the extractor in the photo,  there could still be people looking for treehouse locations in the region the photo is taken.  no way to show a treehouse camp without showing the type of trees in the area, giving away the general area.  i get that you may not care about this, but i made the post detailing all the locations on the map with 2 resource extractors, then they became useless to me because they became too popular and i dont want to server hop multiple times each time i log on.
---
I'm doing okay in it, not great but I def get destroyed sometimes!
---
[https://coub.com/view/ss79p](https://coub.com/view/ss79p)
---
Couples who game together stay together! My wife and I are in the same boat. I really feel like, being a multiplayer rpg, they should pay more attention to group building mechanics. Like, I trust my wife enough not to destroy the house I spent hours building so it would be nice if we could combine camps and almost double our defensible space. 
---
That‚Äôs nice to hear though I‚Äôm not going to reinstall until they add a huge update with a lot more quests and such
---
yea, i find them in power armour and in the fusion core generators and stuff. but sometimes it's nice to just spend a couple hours defending workshops and getting a bunch of 100% ones that will last for a while.
---
+.5
---
This is on paper.  In practice, the accuracy debuff is a serious pain in the fucking ass.  Losing functionality when hip-firing and in VATS is pretty huge.  Shotguns with TS are unusable since they suffer such a penalty.  I also call bullshit that weapons have 0 spread when ADS.  Maybe I haven't tried it enough but I seriously doubt the spread is 0.  I think it is just too small to be easily noticed but it's still there.
---
Thats hilarious, I literally accidentally crafted 2 MTH last night b/c of Super Duper and stumbled upon this. I don't think crafting to sell to vendors is likely to get nerfed, but the fact that everyone is nervous just goes to show how ridiculous Beth can be.
---
Yeah that is much better than the marine helmet, it will be patched.
---
You can't possibly be this dumb, right? You must be trolling.
---
Public Service Announcement
---
mine was running a lot worse. I generally get about 70fps but i was stuttering worse than Jimmy from south park
---
I know, then you lose it again if you relog. My whole build is gimped right now. And probably won't be fixed for another month...
---
Holy crap I just googled WV white springs resort. It‚Äôs actually called the Greenbrier but everything else is exactly the same!! I don‚Äôt know why it impresses me so much, but I definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting it. 
---
Sure think. But did u read what i crying about? Is not a idea! Its what they give us! A s@&amp;‚Ç¨ in candy paper. Any one even remember what Todd Howard says back on stage? ‚Äû16x better this! Better that from the previous one‚Äù What? Where? 16x more bugs i guess. 
---
Open your eyes. They give F76 with mouse pad... MOUSE PAD... But Here on Reddit true hero defenders will smash all bad word directed towards Bethesda. 
---
Upvoting!
---
Free weight reduction
---
Inb4 somebody says "lul just use Power Armor Jetpack"
---
Assuming they're being truthful about it. Considering the result of the "I got banned" claim of innocence, I'm not convinced.
---
Ban time
---
lol
---
Ok, that's new... and if they banned someone for 100k plastic, then theres a problem. Plastic is pretty easy to get... though you'd have to really do nothing but farm it all day every day to hit 100k in 30 days.
---
bum-bum-ba-bumm waaaaaa!
---
Especially because the Greenbrier had a bunker underneath it which was the designated fallback position for Congress in case of a nuclear attack on Washington. This had long been a rumor in WV but was finally confirmed by the government in the early 1990s once the Cold War ended.
---
I'm sure we can get one, For 500 Atoms
---
yeah, now do the same thing with an artillery smoke grenade box and you figure the secret to infinite items. 
---
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!! 
---
FYI - the pictures don't even do justice to the beauty that you will find here &lt;3
---
Not quite focusing yet and read the link at the bottom as "Free Vaccination Guide"
---
Junk farming is to tedious. 
---
That needs to be addressed. 
---
Starting point would be upping vendor caps. 
---
Keep us updated dude.I feel bad for you..many people shit on the game and Bethesda is trying to get better reputation.Then they will ban someone loyal as you.They should unban you and give you lifetime Bethesda games subscribtion :D
---
Yea im considering just not playing until they fix it. If they take too long to fix it.. might not want to play it again...
---
Yeah and it will stay broken if nobody continues to voice it.
---
Why the fuck is that the players job? Wouldn't making a better game be the devs job? I'm not doing their job for free. For all the criticism they recieve, this is something that's clearly supposed to be their responsibility, not the players.
---
Why is it Bethesda‚Äôs job to wake you?
---
Downvoting because you sound deluded, entitled and arrogant.
---
Thirded. My gauss rifle lost 300 damage after this patch.
---
Yer and wana talk about the 4 legendary 3 stars I‚Äôve had ? Coz they are all so useful lol
---
I'm lucky enough to have gotten the Blackbird paints - was on vacation/staycation so I was playing the game a lot, it was the 2nd thing I purchased from the Atom shop (1st was the Sugar Bombs Vault-Boy skin which I regretted getting since I wanted Black to go with the Blackbird)...  and I fully support this!  Limited time items should be rare but definitely obtainable again in the future.
---
My favorite is either the close up of their faces/head when previewing a fully body costume or the same exact screenshot with just a pose change.
---
You still paid to play. Whose the chump now?
---
I think the vendor cap limits are fine. I make more than enough caps selling legendaries to players. I don't do a vendor run half the time.
---
No you're not being a jerk. Demand empiricism and proof. My test was I was running around with a level 5 that had scaly skin and was readily tanking level 42 super mutants in a vault suit. This is not normal for a level 5, I've leveled about five characters now.  
---
Of course, this is not definitive i.e. doing a PvP test with strict controls, but I would suggest retesting after Patch 6.
---
WHAT. thank you for passing on this information!! I‚Äôm gonna go google and try to find IRL pictures of the bunker now lol
---
Happened to my friend, right in the middle of prime. I made a "bridge" of some sort out of placing my power armors, maybe like 4?, and was able to retrieve his loot for him. Good times.
---
Yeah, I agree with those three, but if you're the second player on the server chasing those spawns, it's going to feel really empty. 
---
Quitters, never change..
---
Legendary epic quitter.
---
That‚Äôs nice. 
---
I don‚Äôt have time to farm legendaries and sell them to other players. 
---
Ridiculous for you to even suggest such a thing LOL. 
---
Can we also get an Armor and Apparel split?
---
I think even if removing and reapplying works, you can't expect players to do this, unless you are willing to somehow remove everyone's adrenal and provide a serum to our inventories.
---
Ah yes, domestic kitchen tables. This was one of the last camp plans I unlocked. I found it on grahm. Not sure if it is a world drop, but after months, I only ever saw it the one time on grahm.
---
A tuba is not a wind instrument. It's a brass instrument, like a trombone or a trumpet. A flute, clarinet etc are wind instruments. Geez. Can't they research anything? 
---
You aren't either. Paying to play an Alpha version of a game? lol you all got suckered.
---
maybe take the caps lock off of ALWAYS or change the word, since its objectively not true.  as u said in ur edit,  two shot is not better than anti-armor for vats builds.
---
Not to sound skeptical, but how are you able to produce hundreda of thousands of ultracite ammunition? Posts in response to this have criticized the banned user for how dogged and dedicated one would have to be to gather all the ingredients necessary for ultracite rounds. 
---
You ever had a Mothman spawn inside your C.A.M.P?
---
It's like something out of a tv show. You open a door and BAM Mothman is in the middle of the room and there's a bunch of awkward staring and silence.
---
There are many other weapons you will receive that are just as good if not better than that weapon.
---
From what I remember it's a snub-nosed .44, correct?
---
I haven't maxed out the pistol perk, but I'm pretty sure it's not a good weapon. Low rate of fire, and low damage.
---
I don't "farm" them. I don't "farm" junk either. I don't know where you're getting this from. I just play the game normally. 
---
lol so something is seriously wonky I take it.
---
I wouldn't expect you to grasp anything except a handful of money to dump on the next crap game that comes out.
---
The is no way currently to do that in 76. All containers are linked to you same stash
---
Yes you do. 
---
You‚Äôre lying if you don‚Äôt farm, straight up 100% fucking liar if you‚Äôre saying you don‚Äôt farm. 
---
Upvoting because I agree users post bug and service issues on Reddit not Bethesda expecting support.

Now with all the plans available at the vendors, Grahm doesn't have it anymore.  Perhaps that's it then - they removed it from his rotation and its not on the loot tables for workshops/defense either?  I've seen him a bunch of times since the patch that added full time plans to vendors, and not seen it on Grahm. :(
---
i vendored my TS hunting rifle cuz instigating was so much better lol Two shot sucks for vats build, its a trash roll
---
Yep always thought this. Take the upvote :P
---
Set up a quest in flatwoods. Bring me 3 radstag meat for 150 exp and 50 caps. 
---
I got it from him since the update.
---
and in vats.
---
Played last night also, game felt great for the first time in a while. No lag or long loading times.
---
So..... Played, and not once saw a mothman. I saw the lighthouse quest, which i see occur maybe once a week, but that was about it. 
---
Better yet, stop with the timed 'sales'. If there is a skin in the game files, just add it to the damn store.
---
This is gonna sound strange but I just want a regular one. DOn't like the Albino Deathclaws!
---
&gt; I scrapped my X01 power armour
---
At least when you scrap a chassis the items in it are deposited into your inventory.  Then you just have to go find another Chassis to carry them (which, people tend to leave empty chassis at all the world spawn locations).
---
I do hate that the inventory shifting causes stuff like this though.  It also affects offering items for trade.  If your inventory shifts, the item you are putting up for sale changes, even if you are already setting quantity and prices.  It can lead to you mistakenly selling the wrong items for the wrong prices.
---
Only way to get reasonable spread is with combat shotgun long scope. (actually short scope is okay I've found, as long as you are looking down sights).
---
Probably not until private servers with mods due to server stability and tracking all the objects etc. 
---
Whoa there this is my christian fallout server
---
Don't they have one. The tricentennial emote, opps I paid to much for this pack. üòâ
---
Its well known since last night. Only the negative effect is there if you had adrenal reaction before. The CM gave a bullshit fix of just "reaquiring" another serum, barring the fact that after relogging, it's back to square one, and you have to remove adrenal first, risking other mutations. 
---
This is NOT ok. It damn well better not be a bug that they ignore for a month.
---
The ones I get are 100% and if they‚Äôre not I drop them.
---
If it makes you feel better, laser weapons are still pretty weak.
---
They're kind of fun to use, but any handmade, shotgun, or sniper rifle is generally better all-around.
---
The only thing bethesda said he was guilty of is having too much ammo for their liking.
---
As for the claim about them being able to ban for any or no reason. That isn't how it works. You cannot legally remove someone's access to a game they paid for if they've not broken any of their stated rules(which he hasn't). That would fall under false advertising at the least or more likely fall under consumer protection laws.
---
Where in the hell are you getting that idea from? You must be projecting. I just kill legendaries as I come across them. Also I didn't suggest you do anything earlier. I just suggested there is more than enough player market out there. Vendors should not be your primary mone maker.
---
So what you are saying is that you'll take my TSE combat shotgun for your AAE shotgun in a trade? Deal!
---
I need more content as well.  I'll even happily pay.
---
I went as a kid and it was awesome. 
---
It's probably your budget, yeah. But also it has to a random encounter creature. For example you can't go to Deathclaw island and tame that one.
---
Imagine not realizing that we don't "hang out" and there are other avenues for this thread to reach us. I'm guessing your making assumptions based on projecting your own Reddit habits onto everyone else.

Attacking every single post with an opinion you don't like?
---
You're the jackass.
---
I personally think that, after this last patch, the game is stable enough where they should be focusing most of their attention on DLC. I am not saying they don't need to fix some things (adrenal, bulk scrapping), but overall, my only big complaint with the game is that I am getting bored with it. I am getting close to 200 hours in, and it is getting to the point where I am running out of things to do.
---
I think you can do this in the prefs file? If your on PC check this thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4cbku/guidepconly_pipboy_and_power_armor_ui_color/
---
There is not enough players out there. That‚Äôs a lie. 
---
The entire concept of the game is farming. Are you sure you‚Äôre playing the game correctly? 
---
If you‚Äôre playing for more than 1hour. You are farming. 
---
If you‚Äôre walking around killing legendaries, you‚Äôre farming. 
---
If you‚Äôre walking around collecting junk. You are farming.
---
If you are doing mobs over and over, you are farming. 
---
I'm a fan of things moving in the right direction. 
---
Little salty this morning though because I just solo ran a silo and launched a nuke on Whitesprings. I get there,  I'm the ONLY player there wiping ghouls which was awesome.... server disconnects. 
---
I'd like to see team-towns, but my teammates and I spread our camps across the map to maximize the fast-travel benefit. It would be tough to give that up since we spend so much of our time jumping to events. 
---
I'll probably have to do the quests a couple more times then... Whenever the quest is completely done they just stand around. I know from the mr. messenger quest that it's very easy to distract NPCs from moving anywhere, maybe I'm just interrupting them.
---
But for you they actually start walking down the road and go to locations or something?
---
Maybe its not a 100% appearance?  I'll try hitting him again.  Thanks.
---
ha ha. me last night
---
Oh yes. Yes it is. I'm not 100% sure they fixed rad worms either.  That awesome ap boost we got before from it.. it seems to still be there.. I would have to check more to confirm,  but it sure seemed like it hasnt changed from before when I acquired rad worms religiously. Haha 
---
&gt; rad worms could give you lvl 4 lockpicking
---
Lololo I'm sorry, what now?? That's a hell of a bug
---
I used to think ash heap was level locked too, but I have spawned lvl 65 super mutants and lvl 65 Scorchbeasts, so I'm not as sure as I used to be.
---
Welcome to Bethesda games
---
They were pushing updates to PC the week before console to work out things like this.  It worked well, so they stopped doing it.
---
The pip boy locking your screen if you open it up right after joining a server wasn‚Äôt fixed either despite it being in the patch notes as well
---
Want to add my voice to those asking for this to be reconsidered.  The only real concern with being able to accidentally scrap a bulk item hidden in a list of hundreds of junk items is the loss of plastic.
---
There's no logic to having plastic be consumable (it isn't in real life). Presumably, the player is wrapping or bundling items in plastic wrap or cords and **the act of bundling or un-bundling should have a minimal impact on plastic consumption**.  Allowing all bulked items to receive at least half of the plastic back from bulking would be a big improvement imo. 
---
Please do not require players carrying large amounts of bulked items for sale to individually scrap all other junk they acquire along the very long trip across the map to hit all vendors. You are just slowing players down who are harvesting and selling resources for caps, a staple of gaming economies. And worse, if someone accidentally hits scrap all out of reflex, they can lose hundreds of plastic for no reason other than bulking and unbulking their own junk.
---
Thanks for the pics.  I like the idea of adding a scar after each death.
---
Also materials for syringer mods: radscorpion stingers, bloatfly glands, etc. 
---
For me, if I would load into a game in excavator, then I'd get an extra 100 carry weight on top of the 100 you already get, then if I'd exit the suit and get back in, the extra 100 would go away. I haven't played since the patch yet.
---
Slim no play game like I play game. Anyone no play like me, they do game wrong.
---
Unfortunately the only way to do this stuff right now on PC is mods from nexus.
---
I suggest reducing the budget space of lights.
---
I'm TA
---
60$ Game... Oh Bethesda how far have you fallen..
---
pretty sure you can only tame animals from random encounters
---
Yeah, grahm and vendor bot inventories are not static. Every time you find them they will have different stuff. I had a friend hold him while I logged in and out of the game while I ‚Äúfarmed‚Äù for the plans I was missing. It‚Äôs how I got mirror ball, stone benches, table TV, and metal picnic table. All from grahm. All since the update.
---
Damn it sucks that this game is so bad. They spent a lot of time making this for all 400 people who play it. 
---
I dont which is better but did either of you consider the DR ratio chart? It fluctuates based on damage done and DR value. 
---
I wish I could explain it well after reading about 4 times and I still dont think I get it. The formula is wonky as fuck. 
---
 Find a day job and a family?
---
With a job and kids I'm lucky to play one hour in the night...
---
&gt;It's possible to make a good multiplayer game without cashing in goodwill and treating your costumers like dopey marks in a get rich quick scheme.
---
That's not what this was. Now yes, bethesda did make mistakes with the game, major ones, yes. No one ever said they didn't. However, you've done nothing but screech about how bethesda is the devil. 
---
&gt;The borderlands series is a good example but you already admitted you have no taste
---
[Gearbox literally ruined what could have been an amazing aliens game by outsourcing the work off to various other game devs while putting in the bare minimum of work into the game, all while literally stealing the money from Sega to make borderlands and duke nukem forever and possibly borderlands 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens:_Colonial_Marines#Controversy). Forgive me, if I want nothing to do with Gearbox and their godawful generic bullshit. Not to mention their CEO, [Randy Pitchford](http://archive.is/oPm9e#selection-1403.0-1403.479) is a probably a fucking pedophile. 
---
That's great and all, but Adrenal Reaction is actually screwing the damage outputs of one of the more popular build types. 
---
Its a little bit more imminent than not accidentally scrapping junk.
---
Yeah, and there is a high chance of non-final boss 3* legendary spawns as well, the most I‚Äôve ever seen from that event was 5(!) 3* gutsy‚Äôs
---
&gt;We mentioned our upcoming ‚ÄúSurvival‚Äù mode is currently planned for release in March for fans of PvP, but we will also be introducing new PvE content for those of you who seek adventure through quests, events, and other features. We‚Äôre planning to do this through series of weekly updates we‚Äôre calling ‚ÄúWild Appalachia‚Äù, which will be our first big content drop of the year and spans the next few months. In addition to new quests, events, and challenges it will also bring new content to C.A.M.P.s, Crafting, and much more.
---
Our 2019 Roadmap, which we‚Äôre currently looking to roll out later this month, will give you a broader look at what's coming to Fallout 76 with Wild Appalachia. Additionally, ahead of each Wild Appalachia update, we will share a more in-depth preview of the new content and features being introduced to the game the following week.
---
The incentive for test servers and PTRs are generally playing new stuff before anyone else. Playing new maps in the PUBG/Overwatch PTRs? Playing new builds in Diablo and WOW PTRs? 
---
The incentive is only there if a player is already invested in the game enough to be excited about new stuff.
---
Incentives or first looks Beth could do: 
---
New Vaults
---
New Enemies
---
New Perk Cards
---
New Weapons
---
New Armour
---
New... stuff in general 
---
People invested in the game generally WANT to play these as they will see what might become in the real game. Whilst also reporting any bugs. 
---
It's not our responsibility you're right! but I don't think Beth have a testing environment that recreates 10000s accessing multiple server instances on a brand new build of a game. It's why PTRs are commonplace for multiplayer games these days. 
---
ya i was pretty sure AA for pistols is still better cuz pistols need vats to be viable and there are no anti armor perks for pistols.   title of this post is clickbait
---
A temporary ban should have been in order, I think, after a warning that they would be acting as of a particular date and what this would entail. That way people could get fair warning then maybe 2 strikes and you're out.  I understand that they had to act against dupers for commercial and technical reasons but I don't think Bethesda handled this particularly well. 
---
+2.5
---
100-150 maybe, over a year for each. I coudn't imagine putting in 900 hours on a game that released 90 days ago. Are you playing a game for 10 hours a day everyday?
---
Sent you a PM about plans - I'll gladly pay or trade for them.
---
+0.25
---
I'm pretty sure it's not just pipboy damage values as I'm able to 3-4 shot scorchbeasts from the sky as before the patch.
---
I can't really test to be sure since this is literally the only MMO I've ever played that doesn't have either floating damage indicators or a combat log to see how much damage you're really doing. \*hint hint Bethesda\*
---
Doh!
---
Woop woop, got any secret top tips? 
---
Theres more than a decade of spaghetti code tangled up in these games. By now, every inch of this engine, ought to be documented, with best practices clearly laid out.
---
Instead, they're still doing this shit.
---
Bethesda needs to scrap this engine and replace their cadre of Gamebryo mod makers, with actual programmers and game devs. They use this engine because if you can write a fucking script you can make a quest or mechanic. ..but it's so tangled now I'm not sure the can fix it.
---
All these scripts are tripping over one another, hanging up on irrelevant code from older games...its a disaster. I'll be shocked if its fixable at all.
---
Yeyyyy! 
---
Also, it's "there are" not "there is" when referring to a plural noun. 
---
You must be lonely or something, I make thousands of caps everytime I log on from selling to other players. Are you sure you're actually looking for people to play with?
---
Might just be me but if someone shoots me then heart emotes I think they're going to continue shooting me, so the offender must be ended. 
---
You shouldn't need much radaway, just aim to barely hit prime and drag her out of the nuke zone.
---
We need Adrenal fix ASAP. I could give less than a half of a fuck about scrapping bulk junk. You shouldn't carry bulk on you anyway.
---
Please consider reverting bulked items to be not scrappable via autoscrap, or have bulked items return plastic.
---
plz provide proof for ur claim that "only 10% of players engage in PVP on a regular basis"
---
Hold up let me go find some kids real quick then I‚Äôll go check the playground for new content ;)
---
The Mothman will eventually come for us all...
---
Next patch, you should reduce the budget space that lights take. It'll be very useful for people who like putting lots of decoration into their base.
---
Ok. Are you joining?
---
Thank you, I saw the other thread as well and just had to laugh, I‚Äôm glad you found the energy to explain this to people who just don‚Äôt seem to understand.
---
If it's a 'legendary' butthurt, it will be useless but you can't sell it or scrap it. You must carry that butt-hurt around. 
---
And suggestions for how to fix them
---
"I . . .  find it incredibly frustrating and hypocritical how the mostly melee players who called for the nerf"
---
Been around since launch and I don't ever recall seeing melee players calling for a TSE nerf. I saw plenty of people complaining they were being killed in one shot, but I don't recall anyone in the same posts also stating they played melee specifically. Do you links to support your position?
---
Same exact thing for me.
---
I fell into a fissure one time and was able to jump back down and get it. Don‚Äôt know how but it happened. Probably won‚Äôt be that lucky ever again.
---
The net damage gain as a percentage from AA and Two Shot actually don't vary with the DR of the target thanks to Bethesda's strange damage formula. The actual raw damage you do, however, does. I have a bunch of calculations in the OP at various DRs that show this behavior.
---
You're forgetting about PvP where armor values can be much much higher than 300
---
The adrenal reaction being broken is too big an issue for me to be satisfied.
---
When it happens again, pay attention to what friends are on your server, then server hop.  Whatever friends follow you are probably on their team.
---
I can't believe I didn't know this until last night - but I have one more piece of advice.  Equip the Green Thumb perk (Perception) and you get double your harvest.  If you can't get someone to nuke that specific spot, keep an eye out for off-center SBQ runs, there are some ferns down in the bog, just not a ton.
---
Good luck!
---
Ah, the old "the total hapiness in the world increases" argument. So, whatever?
---
Yup. Feels like the game changed entirely after I started using it too.
---
We need a damn Watoga vendor bot hotfix too.  Can't believe they left him broken with yesterday's patch.  Running off to fight his own kind mid-sale is less than awesome.
---
You‚Äôre missing out if you don‚Äôt do ‚ÄúOne violent night‚Äù, it has a usually 3* glowing wendigo at the end and at minimum a crown ghoul every wave of enemies, with a high chance of legendary spawns (I‚Äôve had three 2-3* charred legendary ghouls spawn during this before) I get enough treasure maps and chems from this event to never have to farm stimpacks or anything chem related.
---
But, and I'm speaking as a melee player, you can't argue that 2K damage isn't outlandish compared to what the typical riflemen or gunners can do.  That's why I suspect the high-damage/low-health builds are the next thing on the chopping block.
---
If you play melee as intended, so to speak, you do a reasonable 200-500 damage per hit (lesser values are compensated by stab speed).  You'll also take hits/rads commuting there and enemies like Super Mutants are rather fond of blocking rocket-powered concrete sledgehammers with the back of their arms.
---
It has enough downsides to not be something you want to do all the time.  That's why I carry around a Tesla Rifle, so I can deal with mobs of Charred Ghouls, or especially the painfully tedious Mole-Rats.  It's also why I carry around a Quad Combat Shotgun, because I'm not going to play chicken with a charging Deathclaw and I need *some* way to bring the Scorchbeasts to ground level.
---
I want to know how Bethesda came across these numbers. Seeing how Beth has been so incompetent  the last few months I dont think its wise to take those numbers at face value.
---
And ammo with the right perks can weigh nothing. 
---
At the highest amount I could probably have 10s of thousands of rounds on me at any time, from crafting and picking from enemies.
---
Also it says within 30 days. Not having all at one time. So if I craft/buy 100k rounds within 30days, that would be flagged, right? And if you have an automatic weapon build you could easily go through thousands of rounds every day.
---
Maybe someone buys it off them, and they only have 1 of the item in stock at a time.  Then you have to wait for it to regenerate.  I know Signs and Letters seems to behave that way.  Perhaps the best time to track him down is right after an update then.
---
Job 45h/week here. We play almost every night 2-3 hours, but thx anyway.
---
I don't give a shit if the player donates $1000 to charity each week. Friendliness has nothing to do with it.
---
Did they benefit from someone cheating? You bet your ass they didn't go throw away those dupes and put in a ticket.
---
They tried to get away with keeping items they gained from someone's exploits. Intentionally or not. Weird how seemingly all the toxic assholes who didn't do shady shit didn't get banned yet your nicest bestest buddies do.
---
Don't buy it.
---
This. Rifles might not be as bad as people allude to, but melee is indeed broken and op.
---
idk his post made sense
---
&gt;Free speech is a thing
---
Your understanding of the First Amendment is sorely lacking.  There's no "free speech" in a video game owned by a private company.
---
My teammate who uses one does as well.  He was complaining about having to reload his Plasma Gatling every time he changed to it.  Even prior to this patch.
---
I never bothered with the energy type weapons so I never ran into the issue.
---
As a criminal once told me "Don't do the crime if you can't do the time." 
---
I tried to join but doesn't say your on on Xbox
---
How did you just pull "one of the more popular build types" out of your ass? Where are the numbers to support that idea? No one I know uses it. I don't think I've ever even played with someone that does... I don't know how many people use it either way, but I'm not just going to make stuff up because it fits my idea of what the game looks like. It's probably less than 5% of the player base that uses adrenal reaction to be honest, but I could be wrong. I don't know how many people use it. But... niether do you...
---
"Vengeful" was my first Mothman encounter, before I even knew they were in the game. Underpants were soiled that day. 
---
Bethesda had a pre-release and pre-beta press event there, they brought in a bunch of YouTube folks.  Sadly they couldn't take too much footage of the grounds--apparently some areas are still...sensitive...even though the official refuge is elsewhere now.
---
I mess around with my friends and turn off pacifist and attack them for the hell of it. Last night I did notice I was doing a lot more slap damage than usual, none of them owned a workshop or retaliated by turning off pacifist. My build is the same as always and same weapons. 
---
Found it a bit odd.
---
Was emailed about the "suspension" after I out in a ticket. FWIW I traded on discord, which is probably why I was flagged. 
---
That happens when another persons camp is placed within your build area.  
---
Been having a ton of issues loading into the PIPboy or map when i first load into a new server. Game cold stops for 30-60 seconds (sometimes it'll even trigger the windows "close unresponsive app?" Usually works itself out in a minute or so.
---
Of course the dupers downvote you.  They are so salty haha.
---
I like to load the game each patch, but this patch completely broke scorchbeast queens:
---
Turns out you drop a nuke and after a brief battle they fly off never to be seen again. Disappointing and guess I'll see you next patch..
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/383782669
---
Do you know how long it takes to regenerate?
---
&gt; A few inside the vaults ago bethesda admitted that they couldn't tell the difference between items even duped ones. Which means they have no way of following a stack of ammo because they have no unique ID.
---
But...that's not even remotely close to what you're saying above (that they "only count it when you put it in your inventory"). Just because every item doesn't have a unique ID that *in no way* means they can't *easily* tell *exactly* how many, say, .308 rounds a character has in their stash/inventory.  
---
The rest of your comment is, again, speculation. Even if The Purge was "fully automated" it's a completely trivial action for Bethesday to "look into peoples [sic] inventories." Certainly they aren't manually inspecting each character on every account and counting items by hand (hence, automation) but it's exceedingly easy for that automation to basically be, "Flag every character where count of .308 Ammo is greater than 100,000" or something like that. Yes, they've made (many) mistakes and poor decisions but to extrapolate that to "well, the count gets doubled every time you put it somewhere else" is a major leap that makes no sense. 
---
When was this even in the store?  Been playing since release and it's exactly what I want
---
Wow. I need to go there in *real life..*
---
The DR directly impacts how much is mitigated. Higher damage requires vastly more DR to achieve say 50% mitigation. 
---
 10 damage against 10 DR is 5 damage. While 100 damage against 100 DR is 50 damage. That's the only true rule in their damage formula. = DR to damage is 50% reduction. The rest scales up or down. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
I don't carry bulk on me... It goes in your inventory when you craft it, duh...
---
Because of this, I finally broke down and made canned dog food / purified water my sole food sources, then favorited them so I could get to them easier on the wheel. Made life so much easier.
---
Similarly, do something with the damn misc tab. I suggested bringing back the key ring like in fo3 and NV a long time ago. This is a single misc item at the bottom, which would hide all the dumb keys we never need to see   inside it. You can open it up and look at the keys if you really want to.
---
Yeah, guns tend to be better at range. Melee builds have the option to also carry a gun for those situations. A baseball bat should NOT do five times the damage of a .556 rifle.
---
If this were FO2 you'd only be able to grunt lol
---
This is pretty damn cool.  I would've liked to go to WV one day and then playing FO76 really made me sure that I would.  I think WV is a real American gem.
---
The issue about hidden events in the Pipboy, that you have under daily quests, is also affecting events for our group. At least three people in our group seem to have permanently lost access to "Patrol Duty" and "Powering Up", along with several others. Thanks for documenting.

Yes I have seen this too. Killed her at the bunker and her corpse appears in the fissure, unreachable for looting. (PC)

Old bug, not new one.
---
I completed it at sbq fight because all type of creatures spawn during that fight
---
Unyielding/bloodied build here -12 HP is negligible honestly. The Atom shop buffs during the silver shroud event are stronger than this debuff. Remove Adrenal Reaction. Re-mutate yourself. I can craft you Marsupial or Speed Demon for free if you're on xbox (and have materials)
---
You can join now
---
Just use marsupial.
---
Did not pop for me either. I bagged a deathclaw, Grafton monster, sloth and scorchbeast.
---
Don't bulk junk if you don't plan on selling it right away. And you get a better view of how much junk you got of each. 
---
Pacifist mode  made you immune to becoming wanted by accident. So if you are timid, you literally had a built in way of shielding yourself from that wanted label. This change only enables a potential griefing method.
---
If they make a new fallout single player game, they should bring back those cages where you can catch and use creatures for defence 
---
Same here I killed deathclaws, grafton monster and a scotched beast last night none of them show completed on the weekly challenge.
---
I think it unlocked when killed a mirelurk queen but not sure
---
Bungie is about 500 people, and I hear *the exact same* complaints about stuff being broken for a long time in the Destiny sub.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
I have never had a problem with rifles - I kill most things in one hit as long as I'm hidden.  I can clear entire open air zones from high ground in seconds with my lever action.  Damage per hit isn't as high but what does it matter if you kill something with 300 DMG or 2000 DMG - it's still dead either way.
---
I have long believed this to be true, even after the nerf patch.
---
It's why my storage is full of just about every two shot weapon I have come across.
---
I've killed all but a Mirelurk Queen today and the challenge never completed so guessing its completely bugged.

Patch #7 will address this.
---
Crafting cosmetics will no longer give exp and they will add the 'UnsellableObject ' keyword to them.
---
You may want to actually poll the player base before assuming that
---
Interesting thought. However, it just adds work to a game. If I get frustrated enough, I would just quit, and not bother playing rather than waste more time on bad people. It is supposed to be fun and not work. There is always FO3/FNV/FO4 and Skyrim which won't cause me that frustration.
---
A test client for the *next* couple games at that.
---
If you combine using a jetpack, and marsupial, you can close a lot of distance in melee. You can activate vats and close quite a bit of distance. I do feel bad for melee builds when scorchbeasts refuse to land though. 
---
Numbers don't mean a thing, when your weapon is firing in two directions at once like a post-coital urine stream.
---
I told my wife I want to visit the Mothman Museum. She looked at me funny. 
---
I want a tour of the bunker under Greenbrier.
---
Still had it yesterday 
---
I still haven't seen a mothman outside of the lighthouse event, including playing last night after the patch. Fingers crossed.
---
Mannacc bell√π
---
So the game duped it!? The game is going to get banned now and nobody can play anymore.
---
Only one on the list I have not tried is the mirelurk queen so. Gonna try one now and see.
---
It had all of the monsters pre checked for me but the challenge is not complete.
---
This works for certain things that stack up, like purified water and stimpacks.  But it doesn't work for all the assorted soups, teas, roasted animal meats, etc.
---
Travel Agent perk in Charisma helps with the cost.
---
But otherwise, yes.  There aren't enough Events that just "happen" in the world.  It is especially noticeable on a server with low population.
---
Gatling laser is the same...been that way since beta unfortunately
---
50 caps
---
Right! It definitely seems like we're saying the exact same thing in different ways. Most of what I'm trying to prove here is the improvement to a given damage number as a percent based on the different legendary prefixes. This lets folks decide which is stronger and why.
---
Only PC users that have mods.
---
Have to disable your mods or fix them for the new updates.
---
If you are on the PS4. I will gladly take them off your hands.
---
Facepalm emote, please. I will spend Atoms on it.
---
Burn like the rest of em
---
Happy to help and thanks for adding another confirmation!
---
Not really - but I believe its like the vendor caps, takes them about a day to regen?
---
Sorry, I have a PS4.  Thanks 
---
I preferred the original issue of bulk not scrapping during crafting. Give us back that bug pls it was much easier dealing with having to manually scrap bulk before crafting rather the bulk auto scrapping to scrap all
---
Someone in a post yesterday claimed they got that challenge from killing a grafton but I've killed 4 now and nothing. Killed several Queen mirelurks, deathclaws, giant sloth, behemoth... killed em all and no challenge. 
---
Wow haven't had that happen yet, but I look forward to the day it does.
---
Ill give you free stuff, I'm quitting soon.
---
I got a 1\* Nocturnal Wooden Arm...so there's that.
---
the [wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing) has all that info, the Brotherhood underarmor all get DR 13 ER 9 and RR 5 with shielded, and the Scout underarmor all get DR 9 ER 13 and RR 5 with shielded, so you are correct, they are different, the DR and ER swap, the first time I looked I thought they were the same, the numbers are but they are swapped, so you get better DR with Brotherhood underarmor and better ER with Scout underarmor...  I think Scout looks better personally but now I know Brotherhood underarmor has better DR I might go with that from now on, thanks!
---
Nothing new, haven't made much progress yet... but i'm still looking! 
---
Poor raider, nobody cares for raider. 
---
this
---
Remove your foundations. Might be a trapped creature
---
Ill give you the free stuff. Platform? 
---
Oh yeah? I'll take your stuff buddy, no qualms at all. Why quitting? It's not *that* bad. It can be fixed.
---
If a higher level player enters the boundary of the area, it will cause enemies to respawn  scaled to them.  They don't even have to stay there, just cross that invisible line that counts as the area.
---
It sucks for lower levels in the area.  But it is the way it currently works.  I think they should take into account the people already in the area before doing so, as it does lead to level 15-20 people being suddenly surrounded by Super Mutants that are at the max level for the area.
---
Yes they can, sorry man but you have to get your facts straight before spouting off nonsense. Please, I implore you to show me some source proving otherwise. I will be waiting 
---
Oh yeah. I was losing sleep over that Nuka Girl outfit fiasco. I slept like a baby last night! Thanks Bethesda! Hugs and kisses xoxo
---
I'm not afraid to admit I'm a duper, but I don't AT ALL do anything to harm the Fallout 76 economy. All I duplicated was all the materials I need to build because all I love to do in this game is build. I build camps for other people and I can't really do business if I don't have what I need to build for people, I get about 4 or 5 requests a day to build so I need all materials to build. I have been banned and stuff, but I don't think I did harm to the economy at all?
---
It's also a location in real life.
---
You can repair it.  You just can't use it.
---
And it doesn't appear to be scaled.  So repairing a 0% Condition weapon costs the same as repairing a 90% Condition weapon.
---
Yeah that scorch beast struggle. Also as a unarmed build , pa isn‚Äôt really an option.
---
Damn. I can make the SBQ's panties drop more than these plans!
---
Ha, join a SBQ fight. They'll all spawn as soon as you're encumbered.
---
Be careful with scrapping though. You're duping the mats the items scrap for. Lol have to drop that 1 steel to be safe
---
The OP is assuming two shot and anti-armor doing the same damage though.........
---
Which are not. 
---
How big are the area margins? There was nobody around anywhere near us, at *least* 15 caps worth of distance.
---
Incontinent Mothman just wants to find a restroom dammit
---
On PS4, I had the pop up twice in a row.  Second time I got infinite loading screen.
---
Why store bulked junk? Just store the junk as it is. 
---
What are the mats for marsupial?
---
Can you put a price on your soul cause I'm pretty shur at this point you your to sell it to get them
---
"Do something great. Make yourself proud," he said. "Make the player proud they played it. Make them proud they bought it."
---
Except if you read the email they sent it doesn't say they have 100k of sn item just that in a 30day span 100k ammo went through his inventory in thst span which could be easily done if you have an alt you move ammo you dont use often onto the alts.
---
I keep a powershell prompt open just for exiting the game.  Just paste this into the prompt, then when you're ready to quit you can alt-tab to powershell and press Enter.
---
(gwmi win32\_process | ? { $\_.name -like 'fallout76.exe' }).terminate()
---
Leave the powershell window open and press the up arrow to get the command ready for next time.
---
Hmmm - I have only been getting the one defense mission within the first couple minutes of taking a workshop and then nothing the rest of the session for a couple weeks at least.  I know I've had to go back and defend a workshop plenty of times, but not lately.
---
It aint march jus chill
---
you can tame animals for your camp defense. I keep trying to find a rare spawn to do that but I end up running into wendigo and scorchbeast before I find a...sloth or would adore a wolf :O (I want one to follow me like in Skyrim, ok?)  one of these days I'll have a camp defender... 
---
\[This sub right now.\]([https://i.imgur.com/IMMdPJW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IMMdPJW.jpg))
---
I don't know what the actual statistic is on the PS4 (for example), but I do imagine the percentage of players who have actually killed another person on FO76 is *low.*
---
Just stay out of the golf house...
---
What? Didn't understand what u said
---
Try Abbie‚Äôs Bunker.  Walk south halfway between the bunker and the power plant.  A random event will spawn.  Mothman is a percent chance spawn there.   After you walk halfway, if he‚Äôs not there, travel to Abbie‚Äôs Bunker, logout, repeat.
---
Ok. I thought bulking makes it less weight. Is it not?
---
You read the updates and the Inside the Vaults they put out?
---
Cause they said starting March, (no specific dates) that new content should be coming. 
---
So just have to wait. 
---
Looks like Bethesda has issues grasping with the concept of Bank alts, a toon made just for the purpose of storing stuff, that never sees any action in game. 
---
Not sure why you're downvoted. At this point, FO76 is not the best way to promote WV, unless it wants to associate itself with an utter failure.
---
How much? 
---
I dunno... What's the going rate? 
---
I will do, in don't know how it happened
---
I bulk everything I can and then when it's more than 10 stacks I sell it next day.
---
It varies by area.  I have been able to stand just outside an area and snipe all the enemies, then walk up to the building and they all respawn because I "entered" the area.  Happens to me all the time at the Relay Tower just west of Flatwoods.  Stand out by a hill, snipe the turrets, protectrons, and the Crowned Mr Gutsy.  Walk up to the armored vehicle, and the Gutsy and Protectrons respawn.
---
Okay but there are a lot of people in this game who don't even play with power armor. I myself feminine power armor build. Meanwhile, rifleman can literally just stand in one place as I've said many times. If I was aiming for the absolute laziest build, I would go rifleman
---
I love you too
---
Adrenal reaction is broken and does not work. This is the thing that sucks for me.
---
Are you suggesting this sub represents the player base? If I polled here and all of my discords and EVERYONE answered, I'd reach approx. 10% of the entire player base... I'm not sure you can grasp player base vs. how many people are on here and various other avenues of communication. 
---
(1.4 million DIGITAL copies sold. That's not including physical. If we just take the digital copies alone, this sub is made up of 169k people. This entire sub represents 12% of the overall player base OF JUST THE DIGITAL COPIES SOLD.) 
---
Haha I'm kidding about the 1 steel 
---
Rooms at the Whitesprings (Greenbrier) are expensive, but we almost did the [bunker tour](http://www.greenbrier.com/Activities/The-Bunker) last year...but were short on time. We will next time we are near by, even at $39.
---
This game definitely needs some balancing.
---
Doesn't take away from my enjoyment though.
---
Gal üëç :D
---
i attempted to do it aswell. took out a megasloth, grafton monster, scorch beast, and a death claw. no changes
---
Can confirm Grahm still has the Domestic Kitchen Tables plan, bought it from him last night
---
If you drop an item, I think loot bags will "shift" to the new position (as long as you are close enough) and combine.
---
Try standing a couple feet away and drop an item.  Repeat as needed to try to move your bag.
---
Loved item sorting mods for Fallout 4. I need this in my life in F76.. Aid, Chems, Food, Drinks.
---
Can't be. My CAMP is elevated from stairs, there's nothing under it.
---
(Although mobs can definitely spawn inside (another bug or dumb "feature" if you ask me), but I would have seen the mob when I went back to my loot.
---
Also this happens everywhere : While I'm vendoring, just running around or after fast travelling... 
---
They can even make it lore friendly, and add a quest that rewards you with a pip-boy software update.
---
wahahaha
---
BAN THIS PERSON
---
Um... so i can sell it later?
---
Radworms, which iirc causes %50 more radiation damage, was buffing things like lockpicking, marsupial jumping, speed demon, and probably more things by %50... for weeks.
---
Oh that's painful man. After soloing it and everything, that was your reward!
---
The more players doing it the higher the mob density, and more chances for legendary spawns. I think there was three of us that time. Whenever I see AWOL I invite a bunch of randoms to my team, usually nobody takes me up lol. 
---
I had this glitch again last night on ps4, my teammate could see me no prob, but then i dies, respawned into the world at my partners marker, and then i was invisible (i could see her but she couldnt see me at all) so we fast traveled to a new location, then we were both invisible.... made it really hard to play together lol
---
Clearly Fallout 76 is pay-to-wind, despite Pete Hind‚Äôs assurances to the contrary. 
---
How does this help console players who are the majority of the playerbase? Lol
---
Guess I'll have to try jumping of the bridge. Every jump I've done so far has not caused any damage and that is definitely how it worked in FO4. I'd be surprised if they changed it but who knows.
---
Find the Top Hat plan. 35 caps a pop
---
Amazing idea! I‚Äôve been thinking the same thing.
---
yes.
---
Yeah true, that kind of sucks. At least take note of the people already there. Average the levels of the players, or don't exceed +5 of the lowest level player or something. Anything. I can barely play the game because I'm only early 20s.
---
&gt; relog fills Power Cores
---
So they should fix all the bugs but not the one you like?
---
In the percentage perspective, you are right that it increase the number for 28%, but the number it based on is very important. 
---
The damage calculation for ballistic is based on ‚Äúon paper‚Äù damage that showed on the weapons. 
---
And this game is favoring high damage  you can see that in calculation. 
---
Let‚Äôs assume base weapon damage is 300 and SBQ is 300 DR. Let‚Äôs not counting other armor reduction effect at all. 
---
Anti-Armor gun will have 300 damage and TS will got 300*1.25. And then you plug in the numbers and you will see TS is better. If you count the other armor reduction effect too Anti-Armor will diminish even more. 
---
Just roleplay that one of you is the ghost of your dead spouse...killed by a scorchbeast. That way when you exploring you see doors opening and closing and items just vanishing. Luckily this ghost has got your back because your see enemies just dying in front of you too.
---
You could assume that because he mentioned skydiving in the post
---
I tried to live my camp yesterday, but the bottom floor/foundation wouldn't move. That, and the stairs. The whole floor just said it couldn't move because it was supporting something.. There was nothing left to support.. I took everything down. Ugh! 
---
I would also like more emotes that are unique animations rather than just a new icon
---
It doesn't matter what you would consider P2W or not. The simple black and white issue here is that items sold IN the ATOM SHOP, added a bonus. Dosen't matter that you can get it in the game through crafting. I can get marsupial mutation by getting rads or chugging a serum, so is it ok for them to add a set of "jumping pants" to the Atom shop?
---
Thanks for sharing
---
there is a sub reddit that would probably like to see your camp  r/fallout76settlements/
---
They have been duped to shit so I‚Äôd say no more than 500 caps even that‚Äôs too much IMO lol
---
Whats your in game name
---
The mistake the other posts makes is that it's treating the Two Shot mathematically as a flat +25% damage gain for a single shot weapon. If you multiply his calculations through and take the paperdoll damage as base+25%, you get his figure:
---
`125*((125/300) ^ 0.366)*0.5 = 45.365186734 damage`
---
He then compares it to the paperdoll damage for an AA weapon:
---
`100*((100/150) ^ 0.366)*0.5 = 43.1043006787 damage`
---
You can see how misleading this is, right? This sure looks like TS is doing more damage! The reality is that this interpretation of TS is incorrect. How it actually behaves is as follows in _two separate damage packets_.
---
`100*((100/300) ^ 0.366)*0.5 + 25*((25/300) ^ 0.366)*0.5 = 38.4801477101 damage`
---
Now you see that AA is actually significantly stronger, as you'd expect it to be.
---
"TS = ((125/300).366 ).5
---
AA = ((100/150).366 ).5
---
Once you find the answers, you multiply them by the damage of the weapon that the formula is for, as mentioned earlier.
---
Once you do that, you get about 45 damage for a TS, and about 43 damage for an AA."
---
Are you sure you're not double counting the 2-shot?  Isn't it the base damage (100) and not the combined damage (125)?
---
I had a server disconnect plus rollback last night, prefaced by a couple of "server not respondings." Lost a TSE Harpoon loot, so I'm a little sad. Trying not to assume it was rollback dupers. Time will tell.
---
There is a perk that adds damage when firing sighted, are you sure that wasn't in the mix?
---
Well, as long as they don't boot up the game they might be ok...
---
Can someone give a me a quick status of this game? I don't need a bunch of detail. This sub is hard to decipher. I bought it on launch and my friends and I played it for a couple of days before getting pissed off at the glitches. I'm pretty forgiving, myself, so if they're stabilized significantly, I'm desiring to jump back into the playground I paid $60 bucks for. (PS4)
---
Actually yes mathematically it is flat 25% increase. 
---
Because this sub is completely delusional. Nothing new. 
---
Or sell it..lolz
---
In a sense, you're actually correct.
---
There's little to no benefit to having a test server for ~weekly updates and patches.  By the time you've gotten any data from the testers, the patch already needs to be largely in place.  It's just as easy to collect comments and bug reports from live.
---
Plus, as long as they're rolling out 'so many' updates quickly, longer term testing (which a test server would be good for) isn't much use except in very targeted testing, since any small patch can screw up ongoing testing in other areas.
---
I think (and strongly hope/suggest) that once the litany of smaller bug fixes and adjustments are largely done, some sort of public or semi-public test server is used to fix bigger issues, which would help in the longer-term.  But right now, they need to fix the more immediate game-breaking issues, and in a much shorter timeline than a test server could provide.
---
I second the Adrenal issue. Its bloody annoying and screwing over my build. I hope to god they don't take a month before this gets fixed.
---
I played the scrap game with marine armor for days and finally unlocked buttressed along with every other mod for all pieces.  I‚Äôll hook you up but won‚Äôt be on until later today.  Add me and look for me to be online.  I‚Äôm on every day but sometimes not for very long.  PSN: rip67
---
Nice to see that West Virginia is embracing a game about them regardless of the negative press.
---
I guess I am just a basic bitch for now.  Food, drink and all my party drugs.  
---
You imply that they were cheating?  It's my understanding that the use of mule accounts and such was not against TOS, what have they done that was cheating?
---
Odd, wouldn't think my particulars would affect those textures.  Oh well.
---
Same.
---
Trying to level my handmade skills to match a silenced handmade drop.
---
Bought the lever action plans, and trying level up as well

Yeah, what a shitshow all around.

Better not get involved, really...
---
Sadly I‚Äôm Not On PC But Thanks On Your Comment, I‚Äôm Sure It‚Äôll Help Others!
---
Ah makes sense then. I don't think anyone else has ever joined that one with me. Honestly that part of the map is always a ghost town. I rarely ever see many dots out that way
---
I both agree and disagree with this.
---
Like yeah it would stop bullshit like this.
---
But at the same time lt would prevent people who are actually trying to help from getting there loot in more than a fair few cases.
---
And last I knew there was more than a fair few groups willing to help out new players that ask them just to bring like an endegoral? Stringer to help out a bit. 
---
Racist asshole.
---
No. I am suggesting that before you come here and make assumptions, you should instead poll the entire fan base!!! I use adrenal reaction. Did you ask me? No. So do your homework before making another useless thread here. So get to work, you have a lot of venues to cover until you get the results needed. Idiot.
---
Me too.
---
You are almost certainly the person to ask this: can you put Dual Bar and Flamer Mods on the same chainsaw? 
---
I broke down all my chainsaws for mods (still waiting impatiently for the 4 locations to respawn) and only came up with Dual Bar and one other. 
---
Also I have been unlucky locating the Chainsaw Flamer mod or corresponding plan and am trigger shy about scrapping any more chainsaws considering I'll need about 8 of them to rotate through for this build. Any help is appreciated!
---
3 fiberglass 5 oil 1 pure crimson, 1 ultracite.
---
Kind of a nasty comment, but it made me laugh so have an upvote.
---
From reading other posts, I thought the amount being used to justify a ban was not the amount in the actual inventory, but the amount acquired.  So any way you could acquire ammo (crafting, trading, picking up, moving into inventory) would count.  And in that context if say you crafted 20k ammo and stored it all, then put it down and picked it up 4 more times, you would have cumulatively acquired 100k ammo transactions.
---
Can you provide some proof of that either extracted from the ESM or with tested data? My AA Lever Action does obviously more damage than my TS Lever Action against scorchbeasts, which shouldn't be the case if what you say is true.
---
People would say the same about Gacey. Nice guy, good with animals/kids, would never be a rapist or serial killer.
---
I killed a behemoth and it didn‚Äôt count for some reason. So it is.
---
And we get the bounty of their tears! Hahaha
---
Their base damage is too low to matter. At least i wouldn't waste that many perk points for the current content.
---
Was a shame about adrenal reaction as I‚Äôve been running a low health build but credit to them for what they fixed, the stash increase freed me from having to use P.A on a permanent basis and I love that the fusion core with the least charge gets used 1st now. Patch notes were the most detailed so far so credit to them for that too
---
6 major patches in less then 4 months is a glacial pace?
---
Ooh.  Player ran simple quests would be nice.  I could definitely use that to request the various things that I'm needing for my build, like Flux.  But such a system would have to be cross servers, because there's never really enough person on one server to ensure your quest is taken or completed.  So a central quest board that is visible to all servers, that would be nice.
---
The pics floating around showed huge amounts of duped items, 100k or more of each mats.
---
There‚Äôs several variants that say, some mass craft / duped very rare items, and some show large quantities of mats. The similarities are, 100k.
---
Bethesda says that because of mass quantities, the user broke their TOS, and was banned.
---
That‚Äôs how I inferred the ban.
---
very very very very odd. 
---
This and it's good friend, mob visible for one teammate but invisible for the other...  super frustrating.
---
I think they are making a joke about how soul crushing it is to Server Hop at the Enclave Bunker non stop hoping for an X01 Calibrated Shock to be for sale.
---
I would suggest Tested on player so it is more controllable environment. 
---
And when you said that, is it from feeling or actually measurable hp amount? Not trying to be a jerk but just trying to figure out how you claim what your results are. 
---
It was Ultracite ammo, thousands of rounds. Good fucking luck getting the flux for that in 30 days
---
I can tell you that having a full set of unyielding armor, 15 AGI, and all the sneak perks does NOT make you invisible to everything. I actually think the detection system is bugged.
---
i dont take much stock in PS4 trophy %s, as 13% of PS4 players haven't left vault 76.  so 13% of players with the game never made 5 minutes into the game? seems fishy to me
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about the constitution and I‚Äôm not American. I just meant in general. Not in any law abiding way.
---
As a melee who "only" does 200 damage (1 star Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet) with my primary, I think most of the complaint with the TSE was the damage to other players who weren't PVP. If I recall correctly, the second shot ignored the slap damage and hit players for full damage even if they were't actively in PVP. But I'm probably mistaken as I never really got involved with that nonsense. Also didn't care about the TSE.
---
I just happened on it during my sell run. I didn't server hop for this like I did mine. Fucking 18 hrs for both! 
---
Hit circle or whatever the back button on your system is, when you are on the options of picking a perk or moving a point.
---
Indeed 
---
What free stuff
---
You can look at your cards before making a decision, just press back.
---
You can just chose not to level up and press back and look at your perks. 
---
Mine is just south of there as well.
---
I'm glad somebody else found it, in a nearby manor you can actually find what I assume to be her room. Its filled with nuka cola items. 
---
It hasn't been as often since yesterday's patch. Also seems like when I visit the workshop the defend event starts.
---
Seriously man you might need to seek some help. You keep up this path soon you will be declaring broccoli is green because of the mind control serum placed in it by the duck people of the mole universe. 
---
Cancel (Back) at the selection screen to view your Perks.  Exactly the same as pre-50 if you wanted to look or adjust your perks prior to selecting a Special/Perk for your level up.
---
There is somewhere a post of a girl that compare Whitesprings to the real resort. It's impressive. I will search it later
---
Did we ever get a 100% definitive answer on how armor penetration stacks? If it stacks additively I could see situations where the armor penetrating legendary effect would be better (e.g. on a 50 cal where there are no other sources of armor penetration).  
---
Same on PC.

Yes as in you are still able to walk at normal speed while draining AP. In every other survival game as soon as you reach your max weight carry you either stop completely or like previous FO games you start to move at a slow walk. 
---
I think as a species we‚Äôre pretty invasive. 
---
I've done no all cap screeching unlike yourself hypocrisy is also quite pathetic :p
---
As for borderlands It's about the only multilayer looter shooter I've found that didn't treat me like a whale in a mobile game (though I guess I should try war frame one of these days) and it's hands off approach has given the series a lot of life many years later. These are the elements other multilayer ARPG's and looter shooters should follow regardless of other controversy.
---
Are you using auto setting on the CPU? A fixed frequency might help to regularize performance.

what's funny is they have PTSs for ESO

it is for all four of the usual ones. check the images provided on the shop

No, read the description 
---
Which perk is it? I had Awareness + Master Rifleman as a basis, then swapped in Tank Killer 3 as I have PER 6 only. I know only a legendary effect that adds 10% to the damage when ADS, but neither gun had it; 1\* TS vs. non-legendary lever.
---
It does work but it only removes a small amount each time you die.
---
Yup, my wife and I have had this happen on several occasions.  When it happens we usually just run away and eventually it stops.
---
Thanks !
---
She definitely has some kind of out of control scaling issue sometimes. I'd say I see it 10% of the time she is basically unkillable. 2 Bloodied gatlings broken and she still had half health yesterday before we failed.

Yep! Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôll be back..

Go play another game.

Or dont and keep wasting your time crying on Reddit, it‚Äôs entertaining to read.
---
They could probably implement something like the Valdacils sorting mod from FO4, it was pretty stable and easy enough to install. It shouldn't be super complicated (not saying it wouldnt be complicated, cause programming is not easy)
---
bulk only when you need to sell otherwise the junk weighs more

I haven't measured the actual pixel shift of the HP bar, no, but it's noticeable. I agree that a test against a player would be a more controlled environment, though. Do you want to tag up later and run some of these tests? I would have to transfer around the TS Lever Action (since I don't use it any more because it has been weaker), but otherwise I have both available still.
---
What enemy where are you one shotting with what weapon. No firearm I have does nearly as much damage as my fire ax.
---
Support people are an overhead cost that can be cut.
---
They basically changed the pop up for when your camp spot is taken to add more convenience. Before you would have to click out of the pop up, open the map, leave the server, and rejoin the game. Now, there is an option you can choose to immediately join a new server from that prompt.
---
That Gorge Scrapyard is a challenge this week I believe.  Everyone will want it.
---
&gt; Flatwoods Monster
---
That bastard showed up at my base first thing yesterday.  I want to say he was level 30, not sure though, and I'm a relatively undergeared mid-50's.  He beat the hell out of me, though with enough stims I managed to take him down in the end.
---
NOT looking forward to more encounters with that one...
---
Sure. Let‚Äôs do that. 
---
Oh no! Now the game is literally unplayable!
---
Don‚Äôt worry if you guys played a lot, your banned hammer cometh.
---
On a side note. The Resident evil 2 remake is fucking awesome. Just finished Claire B run and now I'm starting Leon B. I hadn't played any game other than 76 since it released, and once I got RE2, I didn't play 76 for a week.
---
Tldr, If survival horror games are appealing to you, and you want to experience a bug free, adrenaline fueling, single player masterpiece, then Resident Evil 2 remake is something you need.
---
Yup because whenever I think about FO76, I think WV is a shitty place to visit. How do people live if they think like this? 
---
Although this is a dick move, the workshop literally warns you that other players can initiate pvp
---
I think there will always be someone trying to find the latest glitch or exploit. Bethesda has released fixes for things I didn‚Äôt know where even bugs. So yes there‚Äôs always a watch for the newest thing.
---
He always does this!
---
In my own humble opinion, balance ranged weapons with melee by allowing SPECIAL traits to buff their weapon types.
---
Currently 1 STR adds 5% melee damage in addition to the carry weight bonus.
---
I'd love to see SPECIAL traits add the following dmg modifiers:
---
1 **STR** = 5% **melee/shotgun/heavy** dmg
---
1 **PER** = 5% **rifle/auto** dmg
---
1 **INT** = 5% **energy/explosive** dmg
---
1 **AGI** = 5% **pistol** dmg
---
Basically if a trait has perk cards to increase a weapons damage, the trait itself should give a damage bonus.  This will buff ranged in-line with the same bonus that melee gets.
---
thank you, the other thread is clickbait trash 
---
So what ?
---
Your kids dirty, bam. Banned.
---
Feel free to add me whenever then! I'll let you know once I've transferred the Lever Action around, and then we can run some tests.
---
IGN: Rising_Dusk
---
Thank you for the video! We have seen similar reports in the past and are still working on tracking down the cause of this issue.
---
&gt; Either that or the Fallout 4/Skyrim code was so poorly labeled, it's taking them an eternity to find the bugs.
---
Pretty sure any moderately experienced modder would have an easier time finding the bugs than Bethesda seem to.
---
Limited time is limited. If there where no incentive for people to buy atoms for real money. The people would just not do it. And Bethesda needs this to keep new future content coming. It's not a secret that the game sales didn't do as well.
---
You the man !!!
---
Lol I had a little platform going up to a bigger platform and have a clown hat! The building would have been half brick and half barn walls (ran out of concrete lol) 
---
I‚Äôll have to try and find that spot! The grind is real at this point lol. 
---
Might not have been the same game, there was a nuke dropped *just* outside the back door and so I set up camp to try and get some sweet sweet XP. (Because my hazmat suit is level 50 and haven‚Äôt been able to find a lower one yet. Sigh.)
---
pretty sure the oil rig would have sent reinforcements to most of the cut connection nuclear launch sites
---
It‚Äôs hard to find someone to tag to test stuff. Good that I found you now. :)
---
I'm quitting because all the players on here just want free shit. I earned my shit. Why should someone else benefit? I'll take other people's shit in fact!
---
Plus, cheap pants at the Gabriel Bros stores! 
---
Can you confirm the source for the 30% to base damage for Furious?  I'd like a definitive answer if its been tested out extensively.  Thanks.
---
Fuck bethesda, id rather see more posts bc theyre fucking ignorant anyways
---
you duped, admit it. Reported.
---
Agreed, 100%.  I'm unashamedly a FO76 "apologist," because I enjoy the game for what it is, and manage my own expectations.  
---
I know people can initiate pvp and frankly I wouldn‚Äôt be complaining if I lost in a fair fight but this was far from fair
---
It just got a lot easier to talk myself out of buying this game. 
---
adrenal reaction broke. Read the post.

WTF is "WTF"?

still on beta. that we paid. 
---
new areas accessible such as the forest down south perhaps containing a mutation of the scorched plague needing an enclave/BOS vaccination with the 2 factions battling other the right to call themselves the exterminator of the plague  
---
Sorry man
---
Good luck. I've been complaining about this for at least a month with most players either not knowing what an event is or trying to quote that you can "just start them whenever you want".
---
It's a joke. Whatever they did when they reduced the spawn rate of the Enclave events dropped all events. :\
---
We need to have a l√§mp that we can hold in our off hand to attract them. 
---
Toddaddy plz. 
---
Yup exactly. I‚Äôm having fun. Maybe too much according to my wife ü§´
---
They cant let you try it a week early, they do the patches like days before theyre due
---
did concentrated fire damage increase get fixed? i was under the impression it was a broken perk
---
Happened since pre-beta.
---
It's amazing how incompetent they are at managing their own game.
---
Or rather 
---
'West Virginia? Wasn't Fallout 76 set there lol'
---
I still have no interest in borderlands. After what gearbox pulled they no longer get a cent out of me. Trust me, borderlands 3 could be the best goddamn game in the century and I would not touch it with a ten foot pole, simply because of what they did with colonial marines which actually was falsely advertised. To be honest, it's quite hypocritical that you prop them up and praise them, when literally every game they put out, that isn't borderlands, is just a cash grab, case in point with duke nukem forever and aliens colonial marines.
---
I don't get how fallout "Treats you like a whale" when you literally don't have to buy any of the items in the game, let alone with money, which really the only ones that i personally like would have to be the camp stuff.
---
That has nothing to do with it, and actually isn't true anyway, is you are on a team with them.
---
What he's talking about is the bug that has been in the game since launch where, on fast traveling or entering a building, sometimes one or more of your teammates are invisible. There are varying degrees. Sometimes the clothing or armor doesn't load, sometimes the whole body is invisible, but you see a floating name tag. Sometimes there's not even a name tag. What makes it go from a minor annoyance to frustrating is that you can't interact with them when they are invisible. No trading, no reviving. Even if you know they are right in front of you, even if they initiate a trade with you, you get no prompt to accept or interact in any way. Sometimes changing outfits fixes it. Sometimes fast traveling again fixes it. Supposedly far traveling one at a time (waiting for the other to finish loading in before traveling) prevents it, but it sounds really tedious to do that every time you travel.
---
Anyway, I haven't noticed it happening as much in the past week or two compared to how frequent it used to.
---
HAHA! Seems true enough. I do wonder what CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) they use. Building software tests in the pipeline always seems to get pushed down in priority in almost all products across industries. It's the nature of software development, unfortunately. 
---
I've got no dupes to give you I'm sorry.
---
Bethesda nerfed it.
---
lol even after writing all that OP thinks rifleman are the salty ones?  pot meet kettle
---
Personally I‚Äôd rather have adrenal reaction back cause tbh since forever I assumed bulk junk auto scrapped and was always careful not to scrap all if I had any on me to sell. It was only when folk complained after the mod autoscrapping fix that I realised bulk used to be protected lol. Thing is during a SBQ fight many of us mutants rely on our adrenal reaction for our damage output where as scrap merchants holding bulked items can always go and grab some more plastic, there‚Äôs a load to be had from farming Watoga and Morgantown high schools and so there is a work around. Atm there is no work around for the adrenal reaction bug and if your used to running a low heath build and fighting SBQ‚Äôs you can feel like you‚Äôve been significantly nerfed.
---
lol, what?
---
IIRC, it wasn't the end of the cold war, it was a reporter exposing its existence rendering it as a secret location useless.
---
Limited time is limited. If there where no incentive for people to buy atoms for real money. The people would just not do it. And Bethesda needs this to keep new future content coming. It's not a secret that the game sales didn't do as well. Just hope for new and cooler paint in the future. I would like coal black, chrome and gold.
---
Yep happen to me, I was level 40 - 180 guy with his explosive shotgun azz  - so i respwan near the workshop and he put storage boxes everywhere ended up getting wanted ... but he did teach me  what to do when I got another place  "box it all u"  üòÅ 
---
And yet, I still crashed to dashboard twice in the span of 1 hour.
---
Xbox1 
---
Maybe now this sub will admit the servers have always been shit and stop using DuPeRs as a scapegoat. 
---
Last night I got one of the plants, I ask other teammates to join a group, three joined, we traded and when I left one of them will have a chance to get it. 
---
No need to be a dick. Sorry man. 
---
Haven't had this issue for a while. Takes around 20-30 seconds to quit out though, sure.
---
Game is installed on a 960 EVO, so it's definitely not computer/drive speed related.
---
and yet here you are being a toxic little prick, thus proving my point exactly. never at any time did they tell people tht they would be in violation for picking up items tht literally flooded the servers. most people accepted that this shit was, unfotuantely, just a part of the game now. they werent stacking legendaries, they were just picking up junka and thought they struck a goldmine. they didnt knowingly do wrong, like you are right now, by being a little shitlord. lol dupers were intentionally cheating... most of these guys were just playing the game in its current state. they had no clue that what they were doing was considered wrong. hell, most of them WANTED the dupers gone, and like me, tried to nail as many of them to the wal as they could.   
---
for all the baseless shit as you talk i would guarantee your hands are dirty too... hell, everyones is probably, considering just how rampant duping was, and considering just how many duped items were out there. the game got flooded with shit. tell me, do you work for bethesda? nah, didnt think so. do you even know anyone who was banned? i do... most of them didnt even get letters, and many of those that did didnt even get an itemized list. i didnt. i personally have no idea what i could have ever had that would have totaled up to 100k, let alone 100k RARE items. literally most everyting i ever amassed I looted myself, or it was given to me by friens, and in low and inconspicuos numbers. my problem was that i played 12 hours a day 7 days a week and picked up every scrappable item i could find, and I picked up every single legendary people dropped in nuke zones. youve got no clue what your stupid ass is even talking about, youre just making blind accusations about things that are literally based in assumptions... your entire weak ass little tirade is based on assumptions, like you even know what the circumstances are. there are a million ways to rack up those kinds of numbers that do not include intentional wrongdoing. i can tell you this, nobody i know ever had 100k of anything rare and they definitely never duped. ffs, thats what the ltter even says, though everyone wants to dance around that topic. they say that the items were gained from duping, and they are keeping people out of the game until they fix duping. thats literally punishing people for a wrong that, even if the DID attain duped items intnetionally (and they didnt), they did not commit. the problem is that you, and people like you, automatically assume the words of people, likely because you yourself are ugly inside. thats definitely what i get off you. use occams razor, kid.... wouldnt you think that its highly more likely that bethesda fucked up... AGAIN? that they made yet another mistake? shit the whole GAME was a mistake, and theyve continued to fuck up every since... this latest patch may be the one and only thing theye gotten right yet, prvdied it doesnt introduce 2 MORE bugs for every single one that supposedly fixed again.... and even that is tarnished by the  clouds hanging over this late, unnecessary, and in some cases even wrongful banning of players.   
---
tell me, if they stopped duping (which they said they did), and the removed all the duped items from the game (which they also said they did), then what kind of fucking sense does it make to ban thousands of players from their dying game for having had items they they said they took out, after the fact? none of that shit makes sense... its just another way theyve fucked up.
---
 at the end of the day, this is all bethesdas fault for living up to their rapidly deteriorating reputation amongst their staunchest fans. they cranked out a shitty algorithm, also based on blind assumption, and legit players like the ones i knw got banned for nothing, while active dupers are STILL in the game. thats a fail on their part. cheaters stacked bobbleheads, and duped tons of armor and weapons to sell for caps and real world money. they NEEDED to go... they DESERVED to go, bc they full and well knoew what they were doing was wrong and was ruining the game for others... but most of these guys were just hoarding junk and ammo and passing it out to everyone they could in order to help out other players and make their day a little better. you should try that sometime, instead of just being a dick lol.
---
As an ammo farmer who can farm &amp; craft 3-10k ammo/hr. I can easily clear 25k  5mm ammo in a single Saturday... kinda surprised I'm not banned given what you're saying. Maybe it's because the ammo only flows one way out of my account.
---
and having 115% reduced damage with assassin sentinel is normal ?
---
I'm actually keen for the pvp servers. However I think making sure the game actually functions: no bugs and test client should be higher on the priority list
---
Free advice. Stop begging on reddit, any shitty items people will throw your way can be obtained and then some, in the time it took you to make this post.
---
On the flip side, I'll humour you and if you join my world and travel to me, I will give you ONE free can of dog food.
---
I hear ya. I just don't know any other way to get actual proof on it and it does give us a pretty good idea on the stat in question.
---
Maybe you can headcanon that the character marks them as they find them?  
---
How I avoided the ban-hammer: I haven't launch the game in like 2 months.
---
alt f4 hasnt failed me once
---
I like how the servers are still shit, a mass banwace of DuPeRs just occured, and you still blame DuPeRs rather than the servers.
---
As of late I have been levelling a few mules to get the weight reduction perks and I sympathise.
---
Doing Rose's quests with a lvl 10 is fun... Go to the array, lvl 68 supermutants, install the relay, lvl 52 gutsies, shoot the yao-guai, spawns the 'blades-for-arms, follows you home, rapes your family' variety and so on and so forth.
---
I feel for those that are doing this for the first time, I really do.
---
Its not entitlement, people are expecting more from Bethesda because they're a AAA company that released a unfinished game, and Bethesda keeps saying that they are going to fix bugs, glitches, etc, but then 3 updates later they haven't done shit for the things they said they would patch. Yes they are trying, but not enough.
---
Excellent point. Bloody mess is multiplicative, rather than additive. I "feel," like my crits gave more punch with it on, but full disclosure, this is anecdotal and I have no resources to test this. Every other shot (roughly) is a critical, so at worst it's increasing damage on every other shot, so (for me) it's helpful.
---
Yup, was just going to add that.  The weight reduction only affects the base rate of the weapon.  All of the mods typically end up weighing more than the gun itself... 
---
Which is kinda funny with the lever... you replace the barrel, receiver, stock... thats pretty much the entire gun...
---
Resort plans still don't work. Resort sign is still locked.
---
Recipes and Plans: Fixed an issue that could prevent a player from crafting a Recipe or Plan they had previously learned.
---
I started a new character, one spawned just outside the vault.  
---
Mean. 
---
Well release the patches a week later and then give the test client some time to do its role. I don't care its just not acceptable for a AAA game to create bugs every time a new patch comes out. There are already more than enough.
---
I'm the OP of the other thread.
---
Dude, you're comparing the changes in the *multiplier*, which is always consistent, yes. Once it's applied to the damage of a weapon (which will be 25% higher on a TS version by default), that increase in the multiplier will prove to be insufficient to overcome that 25% damage increase.
---
As I said, compare *any* damage value against *any* resist; using both formulas, the TS will *always* win.
---
Well yes, when the effect explicitly states it. Nowhere does it tell us that Vats criticals are supposed to ignore any type of damage mitigation. And a full set of Sent/Ass FYI gives around 70% damage reduction because of the way the game multiplies the reductions.
---
And while you are completely correct, if this company wants to put out more online multiplayer games, I would hope they would put down some guidelines for what is &amp; isn‚Äôt okay in their games. 
---
As it stand, this ‚Äúbecause we say so‚Äù attitude they are currently silently promoting (and many here are supporting) make me never want to buy any online game made by them in the future. 
---
Enjoy the game while you can, folks, till it‚Äôs your turn to hit an invisible tripwire &amp; join our suspended ranks; just a matter of time. 
---
Wish it could do excavator PA..... that would look sharp with the two red lights a eyes...lol
---
i usually run 3 - 4 workshops.  getting defense events quite often.  the converted ammo dump is brutal!  last night i hadit for about 3 hours, and it seemed like the event would pop every 20 minutes!  it was also like 4 waves each defense.  goddamn molerats!  i swear to god, there were 100's of them!
---
"loll tse got nerfeedddd gg scrub that's what you get for doing so much damage"
---
Same person - *does 2k+ damage with a super sledge*
---
Fucking hypocrites. It's whatever tho
---
You are obviously salty that there are ways to counter your build. Haven‚Äôt met anyone I could not kill. Eventually there will be more people with builds to counter yours. Good luck finding all the stealth snipers one shotting you. 
---
Delete this post mate this is sacred knowledge
---
I tried to solo that, and got my face eaten. 
---
Wow, why‚Äôre we getting downvoted? 
---
Lvl 245 and yet to grab a workshop as i remember üòÅ never really felt a need to
---
For an online game, for soneone who is injured or disabled or suffers from some sort of mental illness that makes them struggle with human interaction, yes. It's easy to lose yourself in a fantasy game if the world around you sucks. 
---
We took monongah last night from 4 level 20-50 players. My friend is level 69 and I am in the 150s. We went to their camp and gave them a ton of free stuff then took some group photos lol 
---
If you take a workshop, you are fair game. If you don't want to have a pvp chance, don't take a workshop until you can properly defend it.
---
This. So much this! A kind person told me about this trick and I've never had to worry about this issue again when using it. :)
---
LOL!!
---
This shit sucks bethesda i dont play it no longer when they dont fix it 
---
Why would you want Hardened over Buttressed?
---
Your assuming the reported number Bethesda has is accurate.  He did not claim he farmed them legitimately but that his character was never overweight and he didn't have that many plastic.  Working against him is most of the banned people are probably lying, but I think we can all admit it is a bit strange for a duper to target massive amounts of Plastic, as there is not really good reason to have only Plastic in quantity.
---
Da fuck üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
...500 rounds? That‚Äôs two reloads. How did you dump 2 reloads worth of ammo before deciding maybe this wasn‚Äôt working and trying something else? That‚Äôs like the generic marines in sci fi movies who just magdump wildly and then gets slaughtered while the protagonist figures out how to actually fight the &lt;new threat&gt;. Don‚Äôt be a generic marine. 
---
See literally treats you like a whale you described mobile gaming's lies and fallacies perfectly.
---
As for the rest I don't go to bat for gearbox or bethesda I go to bat for fallout and borderlands and the best thing for fallout is for consumer unfriendly titles like 76 to fall and consumer friendly titles like subnautica, etc to rise
---
retired.  kids outta the house.  widower.  got all the time in the world to play.  getting bored too.
---
Fact or not, it's certainly a non-controversy. 
---
Out of curiosity, how do the AA effects stack? I use a legendary AA handmade + stinging magazine + tank killer. When I take off tank killer I don't see any noticeable drop in damage.
---
You are way too invested in this bud.
---
That said you already failed in making a point when you mentioned the fact it takes that many rounds to kill a ghoul. The argument is that with current implementation, melee is infinitely better than ranged because big single hits do more damage than a hundred smaller hits. You even admitted it! (Yes melee suffers from not being able to damage scorchbeasts, and taking damage, oh wait everyone has that problem except stealth builds- which melee has access to)
---
Should there be a payoff to the melee builds? Yes of course. But it should not be consistent hits that are many times what any other build or weapon can perform.
---
Should it come at the expense of energy weapons being useless, (as you said) heavy guns being useless, and basically any fully automatic weapon being useless?  Nope.
---
In conclusion: nerf melee, but also nerf enemy damage resistance.
---
Same, also missed it and been saving up for it since for when/if it returns.
---
The problem is this. They say they are working on it. But that doesn't always mean next patch. See the problem? When they know they are putting in a fix, they tell us. 
---
And being a AAA company has nothing to do with how people act. Being a decent person isn't based on money. Because that's exactly what being entitled means. 
---
Nope, this OP found that the *multiplier* is always a consistent +28%, which *is true*.
---
Once applied to the weapons, which this OP didn't do, the dmg boost of TS will make it come out to a larger number.
---
Try it yourself. Plug in any dmg and any resist to the equation and see how TS and AA come out.
---
will be patched as soon as a youtuber makes a video about it. not even kidding they prioritize "bugs" highlighted by youtube vids.
---
Same here! Since patch 5, sometimes it changes from \[HIDDEN\] to \[DANGER\] when there's an enemy at the other side of a wall, while I'm crouching, totally still, with chameleon armor and all the stealth-related perks equipped... sometimes it goes back to \[HIDDEN\] again without doing anything, staying still... lol On the other hand, sometimes enemies literally bump against me and I'll still be \[HIDDEN\]... lol
---
On some occasions it changes to \[CAUTION\] and never gets back to \[HIDDEN\], even when fast-traveling to another place... it only fixes if I change server...  
---
All those situations happen randomly, sometimes it works perfectly fine as it should, I have failed to realize a pattern or a trigger...
---
I do find them regularly.
---
Stealth vats crit build sniper here, working perfectly well. Have Chameleon armor though.
---
Why is it so implausible that tourism would still be a source if income for WV after the apocolypse? I'm sure there was some surviving staffer in the tourism bureau that took the initiative.
---
From what i can tell is that its not broken but a change they made and its just not working the way it used to. I could be wrong though.
---
Okay so 1 think broke. Anything else?
---
It's not a bug. You need to know the metal signs plan so you can build that resorts one
---
Not really.  An engine hoist is usually one arm over the center of the car to raise the engine.  The power armor station has two arms either side of the armor, and would make crap for lifting an engine as either it'd be one side and unbalanced or trying to lift it with chains at a 30 degree angle which is bad.  The arms also perfectly fit over the shoulders of PA, which if you look at the T60 has the chain hook points on the shoulder armor.  But the power armor station is definitely designed to have the feel of an engine hoist.
---
I'm still trying to figure out where in the ToS does it say you cannot pick up bags you find in the game. 
---
I farm &amp; craft ammo to trade because it doesn't cap at 25k like caps do... I have in the past cleared 50k ammo in a day, averaging 3-10k/hr (depending on ammo type)
---
I frequently am sitting on piles of ammo because I use it as currency... I think right now my main has like 30k 5.56 just as trade inventory, probably 80k total across all types.
---
Please refer to my reply on the top comment of this post.
---
Just some improvements you can do, first off set the nuke so you don't have to fight in the nuke zone like Novareason stated.  Also look at the server and make sure you have some level people who can help.  I loaded in and you have little to no high level people to help.  
---
A timed sale is fine, but not less than a week.  I think the Blackbird was available for 24 hours only.
---
The base damage of an AA weapon doesn't change thanks to AA, so the difference in damage changes nothing. I addressed the rest of your comment in a [post below](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asouq3/psa_anti_armor_is_actually_always_better_than_two/egvp2hn/), as well. /u/gigaking2018 and I plan to run some in-game testing to see if Two Shot actually behaves the way you think it does or the way I think it does.

I miss Sharkies and that fish taco place man...but yes that is also my experience. I see cops all over 29, 64 pretty clear.

Especially for Bethesda Team after a patch.

Oh awesome, thank you! I‚Äôm excited to get searching
---
This is exactly what I've been trying to say over the weekend. T
---
Not every cap stash gets placed on world generation anymore. And no more finding 1 cap in a cap stash üòÅ
---
I was able to hit the one ontop the service entrance last night with two different toons on ps4, so it is there some servers.
---
Also a PSA, if you have cap collector perked, and the search Option doesnt show up, walk 20 ish ft away and back again and the search option will now load, worked 4-5 times last night.

Ah, the old [slippery slope fallacy. ](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope). If and when they start offering permanent advantages, *then* I'll clutch my pearls.

---
Buttressed is the material mod, hardened is the chest effect.
---
Because it was probably really only around 40 shots, but that doesn't sound nearly as dramatic, or rile up the base as much, as saying 500 rounds does. So they lie and get all hyperbolic 
---
I doubt he wanted to wait for you to level up 180+ levels first...
---
After 3 1/2 hours I received a notification to defend them again. Maybe just a hiccup or something
---
It actually has nothing to do with the bunker itself, weirdly enough. A data storage company leases large portions of the bunker so due to security concerns, no technology can be brought on the tour. They give you a free packet of photos when you leave though!
---
Encountered two vengfuls last night that attacked me, and saw one stalking that I avoided.  I guess they are still upset with me for taking those eggs at the shrine, but they were so tasty!
---
You can contest a workshop from anywhere within the build radius after yesterday's patch. Boxing up the workbench no longer works I'm afraid.
---
Okay, I clicked on that linked comment. Yes, that interpretation is what I thought, until I realized that the TS is considered a single projectile in ADS. You will find that in your testing. Thank you for doubting, but I tested.
---
Same here I was about to ask the same question
---
This and that other thread fighting is like the nerd equivalent of a WWII dogfight.
---
So... the eggs aren‚Äôt for making love to?  That may be why they are fleeing on terror from me. 
---
Ah so that's what the other guy was missing in his formula - accounting for the 2 bullets instead of base damage x 1.25.

More like half of my neighborhood it's a murder/rapist/kidnapper

Yeah, I remember watching a guys video where he cashed in for like 100 legendary (he was a duper, but I was interested in the prize pool). Everything was 1 star, and most of it was crappy items. That's why I only play Monster Mash for fun, but I am not super interested in the prizes.
---
Get back in your cage, Cito!
---
I think this note referred to certain costume head gear that could be learned via discovered plans, but didn't show up in the crafting menus (the civil war hat was one).
---
I didn't have an issue last night. I took 3 workshops and did the initial defend. They proc'd a defense event about an hour after that.
---
The blackbird paint was around for almost 6 weeks...
---
I think one of us is confused. Hardened is the mod in the same category that's a tier below Buttressed, from what I'm reading.
---
[Here] is what I'm taking info from.
---
Oh right, this might be a bug. Robobrains have a Tesla Rifle, drop Tesla Rifle Plans but they don't use the Tesla Rifle at all.
---
Took gorge from a 69. Comes in and does the confused emote and stops the capture. Kill them for stopping the capture. They do a bunch of thumbs down and stuff lol. Either defend it or let it get captured. I mean really lol
---
That doesn't require any Npc.
---
No kidding... look at what the modding community was able to do for Skyrim.  It really makes me wonder what the @#$% Bethesda is up to.
---
I want stuff too noob 
---
It was around for weeks...
---
It's definitely broken adrenal doesn't even appear in my effects I just took two serums for it. Does there need to be anything else? Do you think its acceptable that a AAA game creates 1 new bug each patch? 
---
Or maybe they changed the event to a wider range of timing possibilities.
---
I see your point. Here are the two knowns. 1. Servers become unstable. 2. There is a known exploit to duplicate items involving forcing server instability and rollbacks. Not all exploits are fixed yet. The "banwave" was a soft ban until the exploits are fixed. If *I* wanted to know if a particular exploit worked, I would test it after each patch. So yeah, I'm gonna give it a 50/50 ("trying not assume") that it's server side or a bad actor, because I don't know.  I prefer it to be a server issue, personally, because I have some measure of control: I can jump servers with minimal effort. I hope this adds some clarity.
---
Best pa in the game yeah sure its cost is 50 caps what a joke
---
Sweet! Thanks for the info üòéüëç
---
Free tip for Task Manager. Open it when you're able to do so at will and pick two options. Always on top and Hide when minimised. I have run into games in the past that like to freeze with their screen always showing and this is the way I got around it.
---
I'm not surprised they broke something in a patch but the exit to desktop option, again?
---
Yeah me too, should make a hotfix asap
---
Platform? 
---
You probably want to put a description of it, otherwise this is a trash post...
---
I thought its more for buying legendaries and more rare items.
---
Ammo management is not really a problem once you have level 2 ammo Smith. I use. 50 cal with level 2 bandolier and an armor that reduces ammo weight by 20%. I created about 8k. 50 cal ammo and with all bonuses that 8k of ammo only weighs 4 units
---
I hope they never allow that to be honest. I would have scraped so many of my favorites. 
---
Hmmm... we were farming mirror ball from grahm and he had 2 on him for me when I found him. It took 3-4 of us hopping for a couple hours but he had another one on him. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just that rare or if there is a reset, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a day. Maybe for each individual person.
---
Yes. Changing outfit fixes it though. 
---
Me and my team had band night at the Sons of Dane compound yesterday:

---
The higher the base damage of the weapon, the more it benefits from anti armor. The LMG for example would probably benefit more from two shot.
---
Nah. I just don't like people being useless morons who bitch and moan about the same thing endlessly and want to be joy thieves because it is what they think is fun. Essentially, joy vampires. 
---
So, this. I think this is exactly the problem. In another reply, I stated they need to hand out some clear(er) guidelines on what is &amp; isn‚Äôt okay. If it is ‚Äúacquire‚Äù over 100k items in 30 days, and if they don‚Äôt monitor the drops, then by dropping or trading 1k ammo (for example) then taking it back or picking it up will count as 2k ‚Äúacquired‚Äù when you still only have the 1k. With this very rudimentary example, if you did this a hundred times, you‚Äôd be in violation. 
---
Yes, no one would do that, but the theory still stands &amp; when coupled with the 30 day monitoring, it is super easy to be unaware you are in trouble. 
---
‚ÄúHey man, I decided I don‚Äôt like this gun; can I get my 60k ultracite 5mm ammo back?‚Äù
---
you realize 360 bullets per hour is 10 crafts of 5.56 without super duper (7 with). That's 42 lead... I can get the materials for that in less than 10 minutes farming.
---
I'm not saying he's legit, but I wouldn't consider 370 rd/hr to even be farming. When I'm ammo farming I can push ten times that.
---
Salt ;)
---
This makes me so sad for West Virginia. They had a great opportunity for marketing their attractions, but FO76 turned into such an albatross.   That site is well done though. I hope they get as much of a tourism boost as they can out of it.  
---
For those planning on visiting the sites, a few days backpacking through Dolly Sods is a great experience. And if any of you are ridiculously wealthy, I think that the Sugar Grove base is still entirely up for sale.
---
I need to grab a crimson next nuke I see, I just used all of mine on a decon shower. Would you be able to craft me one once I get the mats?  VexingMagpie is my GT.
---
I've seen the crashed satellite a few times, so that's not new.  Haven't seen the brahmin thing though.
---
&gt;When teammate observe my frozen character they say she is running in place. I have to log out and when I come back I have to fast travel away from the area within the few seconds or I will freeze up and have to try again.
---
So is this freeze zone happening to anyone else because it seems like it's just me. I have tried repairing and turning down my settings but if I had no problem before beta and the patch... that's not on my end, right? This is really only happening to me? Please advise me.
---
‚ÄãBy your own description, teammates can go to that area without freezing.  I think it's possible that something exists in that area that you have a corrupted texture file for, and it freezes trying to load it.  Which is why you have to fast travel right away upon loading in, doing so before that texture tries to / finishes loading.
---
Possibly something got corrupted in your update.  may need to attempt a reinstall or "fix it" with a known good install file copy.
---
Not sure about your Whiskey issue.  Sounds like someone sold a bunch to them.  Hard to 100% trust what other people say when they are asked since they may not fully understand your questioning.
---
Clearly a duper.
---
Here is to hoping that statement still works for ya if you are ever wrongfully convicted. 
---
Especially if you're an outdoorsman. Fayetteville has fantastic hikes/rock climbing 
---
The Charleston freezing happens to me when I load in after leaving the DMV building. Or really, any of the buildings around there. If you log back in in that area it puts you up on the hill facing all the buildings and my game (Xbox) just hates it. Freezes over and over and over again. Till I finally log in, catch it just right, and fast travel to my camp or somewhere outside of the area. It's that hillside by the wooden falling apart bridge? I don't really know a better way to explain it...
---
This is a full priced Beta. We're playing in the test environment.
---
They fail to mention that Summersville is the biggest speed trap in the state.  If you're traveling through WV, be sure to take your time and go the speed limit there. :)
---
Oh no, it came to me through a different avenue, but you anti-FO76 people seem to always congregate and come around anything about the game, just so you can post your crappy little poison posts. 
---
Need.. FLESH 
---
There is a coal train in the Savage Divide just south of Top of the World, that you can find some coal. It's in the pass between two cliffs. I found some around the train cars. Maybe more in the area. 
---
I was wondering why I never had digestive goo when I remember picking it up
---
No, I know for a fact it wasn't around for 'weeks'  It was not around for even a week.  
---
It was?  I thought it was a 1 day thing but since I bought it on day 1 I don't know if its just showing cause I had already owned it.
---
&gt;See literally treats you like a whale you described mobile gaming's lies and fallacies perfectly.
---
How? I have not paid a single cent for anything outside of the initial purchase. So how am I a whale? Literally everything i've gotten out of the shop has been paid with atoms given to me by the game by completing the challenges.
---
And water by the dozen for when you have way too much. 
---
Okay, I counter with the folks that have reported said issues &amp; have been banned.  Also a small percentage, but still unfair. 
---
Ok, it was new to me though!
---
Interesting - oh well, I guess I have to go hunt him down again.
---
It's part of my daily routine now. If it's unclaimed, I take it and just hop back and forth. It's an easy 1000 - 2000 ammo.
---
When it takes 1000 rounds per SBQ fight, it makes a dent.
---
Still not sure how the new update is going to affect it yet.
---
Yes, they do, and they each provide the equivalent bonus damage as listed in the table at the bottom of my post.
---
Looks nice bro, gonna create a ncie Whitespriongs Orchestra!
---
Please find last weeks Inside the Vault for more information on it. 
---
I will help you with that.

And look better than the Source missing texture around the waist of the T-51b. 
---
THANK YOU! I'm not alone. The whole area is doing it for me. I couldn't make it into one of those buildings if I tried all day. 
---
Of course, just send me a message on here to remind me! I can only craft those 2 unfortunately. I do have a friend that will craft all of them for cost of mats and donations.
---
You seem a bit dellusional.
---
And tbh there are way more bugs than you both think regarding weapons..........  u/RisingDusk
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use Anti-Armor because of bugs. 
---
Sounds right to me
---
Well the 3rd question to them would be can we please be able to lock items to prevent accidental deletion.
---
Ah, but they left you with the infinitely indefinite statement of ‚Äúa *future* patch‚Äù; so you should have access whenever they feel like getting around to it.
---
Must be an issue with the Gauss in general because when I invaded West-Tek with my Anti Armor, fully modded Gauss rifle I quickly came to realize I was better off packing a water gun...
---
Oh so clever, clearly I'm losing this game of wits with an unarmed person. I don't buy a billion games like most gamers who flit from one game to the next. I make commitments to games I buy and stick with them and play them for a while. I can't afford to just dump money like some people seem to be able to. My $60 is hard fought. I rarely buy titles when they are brand new, but thanks for making that wonderful assumption, pal. 
---
They stack of they have different times or percentages i have 20% and a 30% equipped it does pop 2 stims if i get to low, if i get hit to 30 i get a stim then if im hit agin to quickly the 20 will pop a stim, saved me loads, burns stims tho if ur under heavy fire recommend using diluted 
---
Also the effect that has a chance to revive you does nit work you have only diluted stims, i have found it better to just use the perk card for the auto stim 
---
You're asking if we had rad worms prior to the patch? Do you even play the game?
---
&gt; overkill damage is not factored into it at all 
---
I did my best to account for this, hence shoting 2 Protectrons. The odd shot count indicates that the last shot needed only to take 50% damage or so. I run out of protectrons as I only kept the average of the two best shot counts from several attempts. Also, sometimes shooting their chest did half the damage for some reason with either gun.
---
(Once I had to hop as a lvl 40 player spawned lvl 38 Protectron replacements.)
---
&gt; Note that this is also confirmed by anecdotal in-game testing 
---
I wouldn't say that. Non-AP TS was 8/9 hits while the AP Plain was 10 hits, implying that the TS had greater effect.
---
Assuming the Protectron had 350 health, plugging in the numbers to estimate the hit count gave me these:
---
    Plain Lever:                          11.93       (12 empiric)
---
    TS Lever (combined bullet):            9.45       ( 9 empiric)
---
    TS Lever (separate bullet):           10.37       
---
    TS Lever (combined + 10% aim bonus):   8.29       ( 8 empiric)
---
    Plain Lever + AP:                     10.29       (10 empiric)
---
    TS Lever + AP  (combined bullet) :     8.14       ( 8 empiric)
---
    TS Lever + AP (separate bullet):       8.94  
---
    TS Lever + AP  (combined + 10% ab):    7.15       ( 7 empiric)
---
I found two PipBoy games last night - not sure if they're just more likely to spawn/respawn now, but I haven't found a new game since the beta so that was nice.  I tend not to look that stuff up and would rather find it organically, so it was my first time finally playing Atomic Command and Pipfall - both very well done homages to their Atari counterparts.
---
On the whiskey, if that was the case, why don't others have them to buy when they look? I have trustworthy people I have asked. The vender has 44 for me and 1 for them. 
---
I hope they don't do this. I would scrap so many things accidentally üòÇ
---
It's official, fallout 76 is a communist utopia that bans the rich and only gives food the most productive but not too productive.
---
Right.. make sure I poll the entire player base (an impossible task) before posting. Well boy's no one's ever allowed to post again! 
---
How diluded can you be... You just made the exact same assumption in your favor... (I can assume more people scrap junk than are mutated you dunce...)
---
These have been in the game. I've come across herds of dead Brahamin before. But never sure if they are part of something. 
---
I'm not your pal, buddy.
---
Since lengthening the barrel doesnt give you more rounds I guess you keep the the magazine tube, and the lever. 
---
What it says on the tin reflect 50% of damage, the enemy‚Äôs attacking you do very little damage then u wont likely see it, they also have to actually cause any damage.
---
I think the kicker here is how the coefficient for two shot projectile damage is calculated which is going to be one of the following:
---
1. It is a net %25 increase and the coefficient is calculated as if it were single projectile  
---
2. The %25 damage is added and then split evenly between the two projectiles (62.5% damage each)  
---
3. The two projectiles are calculated separately, one being 100% and the other being 25%
---
Depending which way it's calculated will affect which is better.
---
Are you actually reading it?
---
You are so easy to trigger.
---
I learned to run in staring at the ground. And if I had to attack stuff, I'd look up long enough to be able to attack then look down again. There must be a map leak somewhere. It's causing endless renders or something. I used to make maps for TF2 and oh lordy, if I left even the smallest gap when compiling it would have a hissy fit and jack it alllllllll up. Or it'd compile and you'd drop to 2 frames near the map leak. I have a feeling that's what's happening around there. Not sure if changing view distance would help (or even if you can) but that might knock down the lag for the area until you get close enough to the problem?
---
Someone else on Xbox reports the same freeze. Is this a texture issue for them as well? If I reinstall, is my character still saved? I will try anything at this point. 
---
Because you can't handle hearing things you don't like. We get it, you still have some growing up to do.
---
I am unable to craft that helm despite having learned the plans :(
---
Nobody uses crafted guns the market is legendary, mods, serums and the like 
---
You missed PVP... I smoke bloodied melee builds all day, every day with VATS. It's TSE whining. I have one and it was FO76 lazy mode because I just had to aim in a general direction to smoke everything. They get salty because you one shot all the ghouls at WS but the silly thing is they can too without even being a melee build.
---
This is satire right?
---
Why are you unable to play? Did you violate the TOS and get banned? 
---
Damn, I‚Äôm not Bethesda. I didn‚Äôt need an essay.
---
Do you have screenshots? I know that the Black Diamond and Somerset Special do more damage, among others as well, and older Fallouts also had this rule.
---
:\^)
---
That's a random encounter, the most common one is west of the overseer's camp. The following can spawn: a crashed satellite, an undetonated nuke, scorches, ghouls, protectrons, bloatflies, scorchbeast's guano, unique corpses (some have the plans to craft the civil war era outfits) and even Grahm... to name a few.
---
Option 2/3 will really hurt TS, Option 1 will mean it is indeed better (though the amount better is still pretty small).  Perhaps its best to just ignore TSs then.
---
Douche
---
True... I guess those are the only parts that aren't replaced.  Though, never worked on a real lever rifle, not sure if the lever is considered part of the receiver or not.  Guess the trigger and lever system aren't.
---
The overseers log in the Vault Tec farm notes that she was a great student; something along the lines of ‚Äúeveryone else were good students but I had to be an A+ student‚Äù
---
Also if you are trying to imagine her life based off her house ....both her and her parents lived on the second floor and the only bathroom in the house is in a small corner in the basement &gt;.&gt;
---
That's probably what they are planning to do with it but they can do much more then only that. But maybe my suggestion takes it a bit to far, but hey trying never hurts. 
---
Hw do you know it was printed pre war? There were people alive after the war.... up until very recently, read the lore the issue is here is that u just have the map from start ur not given it or pick it up outside for instance.
---
With how many parasites seem to be in the area, I'd hope they'd be cheap as I'm sure people are shitting them pretty consistently.
---
It has to be satire.
---
Dont care what level you are if u got a workshop i need pow pow, u don‚Äôt wanna get shot don‚Äôt take the workshops at lvl 12 üòÇ
---
there is an issue with AI sound detection and sneak perk/legendary effects/armor mods either not reducing the AI audio detection radius or not reducing AI audio detection percentage correctly.
---
you can still circle strafe around enemies while hidden not firing shots a half dozen times before being detected, but fire more then \~20 silenced shots within audio detection range, regardless of LOS, and all enemies within AI  Audio Detection range will instantly aggro.
---
previously you could pull off a sneak revolver build and it would only become dicey in areas where 5 or more enemies were. now basically everything aggros after the first shot, instead of the caution bar dropping by 1/3.
---
Here you go, straight from actual lawyers, that yes you absolutely can sue for wrongful ban's: https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-i-sue-a-game-company-for-wrongfully-banning-me-1186663.html
---
The difference will only manifest if your claim that it's treated as a single projectile when aiming as opposed to two projectiles overlapping at 100% power and 25% power is true. My experience in the past is different, but it may have been changed with the nerf patch so I plan to retest shortly.
---
OP is talking about Anti Armor legendary, not an AP mod.  Your testing indicates testing for the AP mod, on TS weapons, not a comparison between AA and TS legendaries (they can't be on the same gun).
---
I tested with a 10mm pistol.  I have both. The ts takes 4 head shots to kill a glowing one, the aa takes three head shots.
---
&gt;need dependant on how much health y
---
It can't be like this, cos I usually pop in a stim when Im really low and close to death, as i have the card which boosts the effect of a stim. And yesterday i noticed i was healing not even half of my health. But as said before, maybe it's just a coincidence, cos I never had so many diluteds in my inventory. I always did SBQs with plenty of regular ones, so I was used to heal almost 100% every time I used one.
---
Doub't that, otherwise I would be imagining my Bloodied D'claw Gauntlet (1800 before chem's and Revnant)  taking about 5% of the queen's health per hit.
---
If you were banned for breaking the TOS agreement, I unfortunately support Bethesda. 
---
Not currently I'm at my slave job to pay for my video game addiction.
---
I've been running Scaly only right now, got it naturally. Dropped all my caps on the letters and signs, building back up to make the plunge into mutation serums. I think marsupial and talons will be my next mutations. 
---
I always tip in all my games, it's just courtesy!
---
Nerds 
---
Because you go on a rant (this is a rant either you want to call it that or not) without giving any actual examples or ideas what could be changed. 
---
When people post rants like this it's to bitch just to bitch and people take it as such. 
---
Ultra-light exists for all Combat Armor. I just can't remember if you have to buy plans, or if you learn it from scrapping.
---
Just found him/her near the costume shop with 5 Mirelurk Kings and a bunch of scorched. Top 10 firefights of the game so far. 
---
Because what Bethesda say and Bethesda do are 2 different things. 
---
This! 
---
All of the statements of ‚Äúthe ban worked; good riddance!‚Äù are half cocked. If someone says they were *not* banned &amp; they do the very wrong you are so sure others are guilty of committing, then this *has* worked as intended. Why, if this is the case, is everyone so quick to hop on the ‚Äúyou deserve it‚Äù bandwagon?
---
It's possible (and actually likely) that only one will hit in hipfire. That's why this comparison only applies to ADS.
---
LOL. Just how tiny is your dick?
---
Nobody plays the game! Servers are empty! You know what will save the game! Test server that everybody will play!
---
just one new emote would be nice. i think its been all photomode stuff and no emotes since launch
---
Does AA have a limit? Like most effects cap out at 90% 
---
Such a statement with nothing to back it up. And you can't say the totes. 
---
Why can't you? Because. That's why. We've heard it to no end, and they decided to fix their own fuck up. 
---
They're definitely part of the receiver, but they can be individually replaced.
---
Repairer your broked weapon at bench for fixings
---
Actually, people need to remember that anything to do with hard physical product comes from Bethesda Softworks, and anything to do with the actual game is Bethesda Game Studios, with the exception of the Atom Store, which has input from the two parent companies, Softworks and Zenimax Media. Softworks and Zenimax Media rushed BGS to release the game before it was ready, which is why BGS put out that letter right before the beta opened. Their arms were being twisted. That's why Blades has been delayed, because they now have more leverage based upon this shitstorm of a release. The parent companies had to step back and re-evaluate giving them more time to actually finish the games, rather than hurrying them out the door. 
---
I think the full list of fixed headgear is:
---
Civil War Era Top Hat
---
Union Hat
---
Confederate Hat
---
Witch‚Äôs Costume Hat
---
Skeleton  Costume Mask
---
It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt realize it, I‚Äôm just new to the game and still learning how the mechanics work. 
---
Also shitty to assume you're safe from PvP in a game where the zone is encouraged to house said PvP. A lv 12 has no business holding a workshop if they can't defend themselves. And yes that includes defending from other players who want it. You are not entitled to be free of harassment just because you're new. 
---
I've scrapped nearly a hundred+ and haven't learned it except for torso. This is after scrapping prolly 500 or so and unlocking prolly the rest except boss which has to be found/bought.
---
What answers did you get for the formulas? They should be decimals.
---
Whatever they were, you multiply those by the damage of the weapon you're calculating for, and that answer is how much damage the weapon does against that target.
---
As a person that has sued and been sued...this is stupid and fruitless. I doubt that you have the money to sue or know how to sue
---
I will say an unpopular opinion, but  Fallout 76 did not bring anything new that would not exist in  Fallout 4 (except for the cooperative game). In addition, he lacks the plot and atmosphere of the previous game in the series.
---
It‚Äôs up to you to try, but let it be not because you think that Fallout 76 is a continuation of Fallout 4.
---
Everything is fair in war my friend.
---
It is considered a single 125% in ADS, and 62.5% + 62.5% in ADS.
---
Not ultracite ammo though I'm assuming?
---
Just use the jukebox only, if you get there with 15 or more minutes on the timer and repair it every time it gets knocked out quickly you‚Äôll easily have enough time, and the spawns almost always come from one of two directions. Just post up on a table in stealth (they‚Äôll aggro the jukebox until it breaks), explosives work really well becuase the mobs cluster around the jukebox like they are fighting over it.
---
I'm not sure what you are even arguing anymore the first comment says it won't even accomplish anything. You can sue for anything in the United states what in the world is your point@
---
I'm not 100% certain, but they stack multiplicatively and are capped at 90% total. For example, AA 50%, Perforating 40%, Tank Killer 36% -&gt; (1 - 0.5) \* (1 - 0.4) \* (1 - 0.36) = (1 - 80.6) i.e., as if you ignore a total of 80.6% armor.
---
I can't remember that, I have to go back and check some day.
---
You should be banned for life... cause really bruh that combat shotgun needed to be level 50.
---
Oh, and now look who is becoming obsessed and commenting on all of my comments, even though I left mine in different threads by different people. It's nice and warm and cozy, up here in your head, with such cheap rent. 
---
This is nothing new. Every heroes of the storm patch (choose this game because they also show their bug fixes) shows a few to a few dozen bug fixes every patch. So yes. I think 1 small bug that does unfortunately affects you which i agree sucks is fine. 
---
You kinda sound spoiled atm. Like getting a meal and going, "a couple of my fries are always soggy whenever i come here!"
---
You're a fucking joke...
---
The thing that gets me is that people do seem to understand Reddit is a good sounding board for airing their grievances. What they do not seem to understand is that something well-worded and not filled with expletives and vitriol will attract far more attention from the right people. Rather, it seems a vocal group of people want to just scream "Fuck Bethesda! Fuck this game!" rather than give calm and reasoned feedback. 
---
Calm and reasoned doesn't have to be positive feedback. It can in fact be quite negative. However, it feels like unless you fill your post with cursing and swearing in nine different languages you will be downvoted to hell and just be assumed to be defending Bethesda. This community has become almost as toxic as DayZ was before I quite that cesspit of a game.
---
Players need to wake up to some facts, this is for better or worse a Fallout game. This is not Call of Duty. This is not Rust. This is not PubG. This is not Fortnite. This is it's own strange beast. Expecting it to conform to genre mold of any of those games is to have false expectations.
---
Lol.

A lawyer will cost waaaaay more than $60 of your hard earned money.

Still happens they have an inability to fix simple database sync issues, they are entirely capable of saying hey we fixed this.... this does not mean however they actually have 
---
Yeah, a Radium Rifle is a bad choice, because any weapon with ADS spread by default will be even worse TS. Radium is one of them.
---
You might be right?
---
Im just trying to max out my Marine Armor. 
---
I can't make either one of those mods. 
---
Yep
---
Yeah seriously, people need to quit whineing. The last patch changes to workshop claiming show how Bethesda feels about the topic. Workshops belong to whoever is strong enough to HOLD it. Not who gets there first. And I'm lv 181, I love "teaching" these noobs how a real wasteland works, I'm after your brown paper bag and caps thank you very much.
---
I never signed terms of service....just put the game in played. Woke up the next day and banned. And the person with the dick comment. You really have to rethink your lifestyle. If your idea of life is to scroll through Reddit and post..... nevermind he probably still won't get it.
---
Nah. Just can't stand trolls with nothing better to do. But hey, feel free to keep stalking me like you have no life, weirdo. 
---
Do you have the T45 Power armor?
---
I did this sneaking around inside Morgantown High School. Didn't know anyone else was in the area as we BOTH were sneaking using silenced weapons. I rounded the corner, got spooked and let loose a round. He simply retaliated in kind, we both stood up, gwaved at one another, then we both slithered off in our own separate directions.
---
Personally, I'd like the ability to optionally keybind emotes rather than just use the emote wheel (or if I'm dumb and don't know how someone please enlighten me).
---
1) No companies will refund a game 4 months after release.
---
2) The game is playable, just because it has inconvenient bugs at times doesn't make it not.
---
3) Pretty sure this dildo got banned and that's why he's butthurt.
---
Maybe you can pay a lawyer in all those Nuka Colas you tried to sell...
---
Gunpowder...
---
but yea i'd rather scrap manually after i auto-scrap
---
What you want is a class action law suit but it would be up to the lawyers to contact people not you. Right now you would be technically violating the lawsuit and jeopardizing the case by talking about it. 
---
First you should find a lawyer that would take it on, keep in mind not a regular one but a firm experienced in these actions so unless they wave the retainer... hope you have about $25k to secure for them... lawyers always get paid. 
---
Individual lawsuits will be held up by their lawyers and they‚Äôll take you in attorney fees. Keep in mind if you back out they can then file a lawsuit against you for attorney fees. 
---
Haha nice. If you do get Marsupial, I recommend also getting birb bonez or you'll sometimes die to your own jumps... it was a real pain for me before I acquired that one.
---
I'm sorry :( I wish I could edit titles; I thought that very thing. My point was simply about damage though, not accuracy or recoil.
---
This is amazing. I want more pictures!
---
This. PvP us FUN. It doesn't have to be shit talking and hurt feelings lol. I had an amazing battle last night, me and a friend against three others, none of us below lv 50, and it was a blast!
---
If you're on Xbox I can mod them for you. I got them by scrapping. Buttressed is the highest for the damage upgrade, and there are other ones for the other slot (like Ultra-Light).
---
I'm currently rocking 3* Weightless (buttressed and ultra light on all pieces) Marine Armor...sneaking is a non-issue. I can just creep into mobs and keep "caution", 3.5x dmg to all :).
---
Ok... online now, if you have caps... 2.000 for 3 legs and 2 torsos ok with u?
---
Actually would make the serves more stable calling up smaller containers rather than the current all encompassing stash, anybody who uses server stability have A never hosted a server or B is a moron
---
All of his posts are about selling Nuka Cola (all flavors). He was a duper and got banned.
---
You're the one who triggered like a snowflake millennial. Just because I have a different opinion does not make me a troll. You responded - that makes me a troll. Good job.
---
Well im def going to log on and see later, im kinda pissed about the adrenal mutation not working. Hopefully its not so bad. 
---
Hope you teabagged his corpse too lol. People like this should get out of the wasteland and play farmville or some shit.
---
People take the game way too seriously both players who get raised and dicks who raid. We try to strike a balance of competition and fun and we usually repair shit we break lol
---
Agreed.
---
That's correct. I don't farm the SBQ, so I have no idea what a solid ultracite farm looks like... but the numbers themselves are as insane as most people seem to think... 5mm/50 cal crafts 234 at a time (on average after super duper with ammosmith)... that's just over 4 crafts per thousand ammo.
---
You forgot the part where you duped and got caught.
---
Nothing he wrote is wrong, though.
---
I did not know that (though I did know a lot of similar facilities, like decommissioned missile bases, were being used that way).  Cool!
---
I'm not your buddy, guy. 
---
I just did, yes. 
---
Dude by launching the game and connecting to the servers you have to agree to the TOS and by playing you are, therefore your case is already null and void
---
+3.14159265359
---
Same with me on XB1
---
It feels like a continuation of 4.  A new but similar world.  Very similar gameplay.  Less story.  Every once in a while you will cross paths with another player.
---
&gt;As a person that has sued and been sued...this is stupid and fruitless
---
Depends on the country. In my country, it is quite realistic to sue for violation of consumer rights and not to spend a penny. And if a company does business in this country, it will have problems. In addition, our courts are very conservative and in such matters usually stand on the side of the consumer.
---
They should work the same, only the armor-ignore percentage number is different, right?
---
lulz. loser.
---
You spewed your triggered crap all over and now your upset someone saw it. Bummer, dude!
---
Now this is just me spitballing, but it's possible that since bobbleheads are an aid item, the challenged got marked with consuming Aid items, but wasn't specified Aid-Bobblehead. Again, total conjecture but could be why. Likely just a small oversight. 
---
One of them he is literally discussing selling 6k to some guy.
---
Weird, I'll check it out! Thanks!
---
Please address what is said in this post about anti-armor.
---

---
It's not about the 60$ it's simple....show me where I signed this terms of service (there was none for this game) if you can't show me then either let me play what I paid for or give me the money back. 
---
They made a change to them,  the change was crap half of them are missing now or glitched 
---
Yeah. I'm the one with growing up to do, as you follow me and post comments following all of my comments on the topic. That's really a sign of stability and maturity right there. If you grew up and understood the world a little better, you would perhaps see my point that stealing someone's joy is a bullshit way of living. But no, you're too immature to understand that concept. 
---
Meanwhile, my only crime is just hanging around them to fight them. I guess it's easier to get rid of the ppl who hang with them than to actually get rid of the dupers.
---
I've gotten both of those before last patch, so don't think those are new but they seem pretty rare none the less.
---
D'oh, I was clearly thinking of the legendary effect.  Sorry, old noggin ain't what it used to be I guess.
---
I'm not your guy. pal.
---
I am confused where the source of the weapon coefficient and the 125%damage percent for two shot? What the source of this number?
---
You were banned for cheating.
---
Ok Bethesda 
---
it most definitely was not. don't know if it was a 24 hour esclusive but it was definitely only a few days at most.
---
The entitlement in today's day and age is fucking incredible.
---
its amazing how well the game reflects the actually locations.  when i clicked on harpers ferry it shows the two bridges (when you fast travel you spawn on one of them) and it looks almost identical
---
Why is the playable area so small
---
He is fun to follow and smashes every enemy
---
Its just a room with some posters a quantum and a nuka cola truck. Idk little bit of head cannon honestly 
---
He had ***350 THOUSAND*** ultracite ammo... you need far more mats to do be able to craft that and getting them all is time consuming. We aren't even talking about the regular ammo here. You're saying that you have 80k total across *all types* which aren't even rare.
---
+0.10
---
Right, I was surprised that websites like comicbook etc had written stories about the guy. 
---
Wow. I quit playing the game like 3 months ago because of the Scorchbeast sonic scream attacks. And they just fixed it. This is awkward.
---
Well they said this patch this week is the last before new content in the next patch, so give it another week.
---
So I have an AA Gatling gun and a TSE Gatling gun. If I‚Äôm trying to kill a flying scorch beast the AA does significantly more damage per shot. Even though when I view them in my inventory the TSE shows that it does 50% more damage than the AA. 
---
Well the OP didn't say anything about being diasabled, injured, or suffering a debilitating mental illness. I saw nothing about the game being his therapy. 
---
Yeah colas I bought from another player and sold to others ...didn't dupe. Not a violation.
---
Reading all the comments. It's just yours that stick out as actively attacking opinions different than yours.
---
I got a bloodied baseball bat from it. Never gone back since.
---
wish I would have waited and could have gotten the game free with some thumb sticks or a flash drive
---
Enjoy the ban fuckboy.
---
I've requested to see what items I have that were flagged.  I don't fit the criteria listed in this post or the email.
---
Im going to counter sue for sueing Bethesda
---

---
I think it would be nice to have a non-SBQ boss, yes.  There's something kind of odd about entering a nuke zone to pick some flowers...
---
Here is what is crazy about HUD, I removed mine because I upgraded the helmet level, but I still get the red highlights. Go figure. 
---
I get that... just letting him know that People want to file a lawsuit should know the talk... no one individually could afford to do that. That‚Äôs why attorneys in lawsuits like this are the ones that set up the terms for clients pro bono. 
---
They get a huge part as long as there are enough people to sign in on the lawsuit. 
---
Discovery phase would also open the door on all he duped to trigger the ban which is what happened with the violation of the TOS. 
---
So unless some actual lawyer can get around that, he doesn‚Äôt have a chance...
---
Think it's called ems testing facility, you go there, 5 lead nodes, 5+ iron nodes, little further south, even more if each, more to the West and East and South of there. I usually pull about 300 lead ore and 500 iron in less than 5- but I could just switch server after pulling from the first nodes and have 3x that very quickly.
---
If he duped the materials to craft bullets, it wouldn't be bullets in the list it would be the materials.
---
The way it's worded, simply having 100k of something in any 30 day period would trigger the dupe detection, it doesn't specify well enough for us to argue this point. It doesn't say he had each of those in the same damn 30 days, those could be just the highest amounts he's had of each at any point within 30 days.
---
In *any case* those numbers are actually pretty realistic, not obscene numbers that are impossible to craft. My original point stands that no one is doing to dupe *ammo only*, there would be something else that reaches 100k.. and if he did dupe something besides ammo, it's Bethesda's fault for not setting a lower threshold.
---
Because if there's even a tiny chance that a guy with 900 fucking hours crafted that much ammo (which is more than a slight chance), the issue is how Bethesda chose to determine if someone was duping.
---
I made a post that explains all the different ways they could have and should have tried to detect this, they were just lazy, plain and simple. And you and others like you are basically defending them being lazy, when how much AMMO someone has, has*zero impact on the game or economy*.
---
He was banned for duping
---
[Yeah but...](https://giphy.com/gifs/willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory-dont-care-veruca-salt-vO8F4fYQd39h6) 
---
That said, development and patch cycles take time. Makes sense that some bugs are quicker to get resolved than others. At least they fully acknowledge them even if they can‚Äôt give a resolution date.
---
Its made progress if u already own it play it if u didn‚Äôt own it i would have said wait till march 
---
Happens to me ocasionally. Usually the solution is change servers :/
---
Yes, they said that you can sue and win but the amount you would win wouldn't be much, (the cost of the game) but it would be the cost of the game itself.
---
The link shows that they can ban for no reason, but they will be on the hook for the cost of the game if they do as they are breaking their end of the contractual obligation they put out.
---
It's a really beautiful State and I love that the tourism board has gotten behind the FO tie-in. If you like outdoor activities (as I do) there is just so much to see and do there. Really nice people too.
---
Is it easier to fight? What I mean is Fallout 4 seems very clunky to move &amp; fight at the same time. I'm probably spoiled playing Destiny 2. I was hoping that either this is improved in Fallout 76 or maybe it is just me not used to it yet
---
You need the treated first, learn it and the next level will unlock at the various vendpra. Watoga will have bos plans, raider train station will have the raider versions, the bunker will have the marine versions etc
---
Even playing solo?  
---
Very cool hiking/rock climbing. Been there multiple times!
---
"I didn't dupe them, I bought them off someone else who did" is his current excuse.
---

You must be new to the internet! The reason why this wouldn't be allowed on public servers is because the worst parts of our society can, and will always fuck things up for the rest of us. You, an upstanding citizen would unleash a thousand quests about tentacle rape, dick jokes and racist diatribes from the lowest common denominators. 
---
&gt;It feels like a continuation of 4.
---
"Feeling" is a subjective judgment. Objectively, the engine has not undergone any visible changes, the bugs have been carefully ported (and there are fewer quests in the game). Graphics, gameplay and QoL remained the same.
---
This is an awesome idea. Put out a requisition. 500 caps for what you want, reasonably ofc. You get some exp and caps. I get my shit. Awesome idea. 
---
Everything is better than the two shot right now.
---
upvoted for visibility
---
it'd be a nice "sorry we messed up Adrenal Reaction so bad" gesture
---
I'd honestly pay twice as much for it, don't you want my 36 bucks Bethesda?
---
Then you need to find a judge willing to hear the case without just tossing it out.
---
Are the graphics better? How about building? Trying to place a floor so it is parallel to the foundation of an old house seems impossible. I even googled I'm rubbish :D
---
If you have the game just try it out. There's been 6 patches since you last played, so I'll go out on a limb and say yes, performance has improved significantly.
---
Wish I could upvote more!
---
I'd gladly record some flavor text and hand out a legendary tire iron for 10 deathclaw eggs.
---
I'm currently at Level 135 or so, and over 500 hours, and I suppose I have been lucky with the RNG compared to most. I have gotten many Top Tier legendary drops from the game, including TSE Handmades, Dragons, Gatlings, Gauss, Combat Rifles &amp; SGs, and even a few really good melee weapons, I've also gotten some really great Armor, more so earlier in the game, then lost it all to a glitch (but that's a different issue).
---
I have never been involved in Duping, and even discouraged it where I could, I got an Explosive Hunting rifle just 3 hours after the patch that added them, and turned down an offer of 25k caps to borrow it for a day. 
---
I regularly trade with other players (Fair Trade Only, like Grahm), though all of my primary weapons are self looted, I do have a few weapons (taken on trades) that are most likely Dupes, and I understand why players buy what they can't seem to get.
---
Duping had a serious impact on the game economy, and any chance for successful Player Vendors, (adding most plans to vendor inventory hurt it nearly as much, IMO),for that I am glad to see them banned, but for many I think a 90 day ban, and complete account reset would be a better choice, for those that sold duped weapons on Ebay, a Total Ban across all gaming platforms would be more fitting.
---
RNG can be a fickle bitch, I go for several days getting garbage drops, then get several great rolls in one event, and I've met players who have 300+ hours that haven't gotten anything great, but they continue the grind. I have met a few that spend all their time in a select few locations grinding for gear so much that they have only explored 20%-40% of the Map, and still not completed the main quest lines at level 100+
---
The game mechanics and RNG definitely need some tuning, Quests, and Events should absolutely reward better gear (that you don't already have) &amp; plans (that you don't already know), I'm hopeful that the elimination of Duping and the Purge of Duped items will allow the game economy to stabilize to an acceptable level, where all players will be forced into Fair Trade, until then, it's everyone's personal choice if they want to pay 5000 caps for some Top Tier weapon (nothing in this game is worth that much, IMO), or spend the time Hunting legendary enemies themselves. 
---
Is it March? Everything about survival mode has always said March. Calm down and be patient. 
---
He must have gotten a huge deal to sell then 2 for 1 cap. LoL
---
I use power patcher its been over a month since I last repaired power armour i wear it 24/7 and male scorch beasts 
---
I'm still researching it, but junkies, depending on who you ask, either just bugs and you can't see the effect, or the addictions go away too fast and are too hard to acquire.  So unless you say otherwise, it just isn't feasible to me.
---
Bloodied is okay, if you spec for it or always run at 70% or lower health. Otherwise, don't bother. 
---
Furious does not appear to work on shotguns, and is problematic on many weapons.  I would avoid.
---
Also, faster fire rate is a bit underrated, especially with quad or in builds where you have a chance to cripple imo. 
---
With the right spec, 50% crit is better than anything, and with a moderate spec it is as good as the other two.
---
However, one interesting thing is that crit seems to ignore resist, unconfirmed, but stated recently with some authority, so some more investigation is needed.  That means that something like what I have, an anti armor vats crit shotgun, sort of cannibalizes itself, which is kind of sad.  
---
Yeah so obviously bethesda is fucking lazy, and they didn‚Äôt want to make a whole new model for an engine/car repair prop so they reused the PA frame to fill space. It‚Äôs a game tard. Power armour wasn‚Äôt for public use, in case you forget one of the most basic pieces of lore is that around the time of PA invention and use the public began to riot and civil unrest was rampant as America‚Äôs situation worsened. The US even deployed us troops on their own soil to contain the uprisings. 
---
So you really think every fucking tim and john around had a high grade cutting edge military armour equivalent to a tank on legs? No, Bethesda knows people don‚Äôt care about the Fallout anymore so they could care less. Also really shows their fucking disregard for the series, shitting out two disappointments in a row. Have fun with your ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù until the end of time because they put out a broken game arguably in an alpha stage of development. 
---
Exactly... Judge Judy memes in 3, 2, 1...lol
---
Hence why i bolded my main problem with this whole conversation. 
---
It's definitely odd. But I think it fits the wacky fallout vibe. People killing each other at ground zero of a nuke over flowers. It's hilarious.
---
I wouldn't mind if we could scrap legendaries, but only for regular components. Game is easy enough.
---
You can shoot with water behind your targets and see that it's 2 projectiles. Multiple times I've hit my target (blood impact) + hit water (splash impact). The two shot is two shots which frequently misses.
---
He's so full of shit I can smell it through my monitor.
---
ummmm ok
---
I‚Äôve been bugging my friends to road trip to The Greenbriar resort in white sulphur springs in WV from our house in Kentucky. It‚Äôs about 3 hour drive. I‚Äôve been to the real resort but it was dark and just driving past slow, still very impressive. The game designers got a lot right on the exterior. Having the early release party there was a cool idea. I would like to play golf there but the green fees aren‚Äôt cheap. 
---
maxes out at 80 at level 3. so you need a total of 20 str.
---
Maybe so. But the vendor bot works for bethesda. So if i bought duped goods, bethesda is guilty of selling them, so they are just as guilty if not moreso because they also bought them. And they are the ones who profited from the trade.
---
(See folks, that is how to frame a successful defense)
---
:)
---
Yes. They don't need to be "natural" strength points. Check your pip boy SPECIAL stats tab to see your strength after all of your effects. That's what's used for calculation.
---
Same here.
---
I can see someone wanting to buy a bunch of cheap handmade or 10mm smgs to scrap them.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS?! Honest players who paid and played since buying the game are getting suspended all because some of us went out of our way to stockpile caps for good guns off of Discord. Some of us played hardcore just to own half the shit the duper‚Äôs had. My fucking account just got suspended two days ago, and I‚Äôve never fucking hacked/exploited a single god damn bug in f76. The whole group of hackers has basically fucked over 80% of the Fallout gaming community. I‚Äôve had to resort to GTA online. I haven‚Äôt played GTA in 6 years. Lol and that game seems to be in a even worse state with the amount of glitches I‚Äôve already noticed, yet they don‚Äôt ban people. Bethesda if your reading this just drop the bullshit already and give people their Accounts back. There‚Äôs going to be a shit ton of crap all over social media for months and more than likely the REAL news will be a part of this if it continues to get bigger. Do you want that Bethesda? No other gaming company has done this sort of thing as far as I can tell. And if there is one, they can burn to the ground. Idc anymore if it‚Äôs bad or not for what the hackers did. I‚Äôm missing out on all the cool new updates now, and I bet a shit ton of other honest players are now too. You think I wanna be driving a sports car around just to get blown up by an Oppressor on the streets of Los Santos? No I wanna kill flying mutant bats!!!! Like come on. Lmao /end rant üòâ
---
I do not know whether this is good or bad, but for the court in some cases this will be an empty sound. The ToS cannot contradict federal laws, but there is a big legal difference between ‚ÄúI paid the money and they didn‚Äôt provide me services‚Äù and ‚Äúsee, he made more bottles of soda‚Äù.
---
However, this does not apply to all countries and their laws.
---
True fan right there 
---
I have *most* of them already-checked as well.
---
&gt; all legendary effects with increasing damage (Bloodied, Furious, etc) cap out at higher percentages
---
Source?  What "higher percentages"?
---
I am assuming Black Rider will be the next power armor skin to drop?
---
I know that it is THE most efficient build type for outputting damage. If there's any trend with other online MMOs then there are certainly a large portion of players who are actually "optimizing" their builds. It also covers alot because both ranged and melee utilize this mutation. Melee gets such high numbers because it's overpowered inherently, but those numbers are much higher with adrenal reaction.
---
Simply from the amount of people here that are acknowledging the bug, I would think probably use it. I've seen 5 posts just this morning regarding the bug, and alot more people commenting on it. 
---
Downvoting you because you started a flame response with "lolz"
---
Yes. That‚Äôs the big secret. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs perfect setting for post nuke video game. 
---
We will test with players to get an accurate reading. Water won‚Äôt tell me how much damage they took. 
---
Bottom line if you have a sell/buy system in your game and you buy or pick up items from other players that's not a violation of tos. If I duped I understand but why would I even post this if I duped ...think about it. The tos never specified the amount of items we can have on us nor amount we can receive from other players .... If you walked up to a container and found hundreds of items in it a pressed take all are you in violation?
---
Lol at adrenal reaction literally having "cut" in it's code
---
Not just the hiking, which is awesome. Longpoint trail is my favorite, it gives you the best view. Secret sandwich society is the best place to eat in WV. 
---
Quick question: is it possible to have both two shot and anti armor legendary effects?
---
I'm going to counter sue you for counter sueing him because he sued bethesda just because it seems like the hip thing to do...
---
not protected and shielded I don't think. supposedly they drop from events, raider from Uranium Fever for example.
---
but I've been doing it for months now and nothing.
---
We outta do a FO76 players retreat at the resort and do a LAN party unofficially of course. I‚Äôd go and help setup. We used to do LAN parties years ago with CS it was great. 
---
Performance of servers has been almost flawless for me lately. 
---
I really enjoy reading these.  Thanks for all your work in producing them.
---
Enjoy the ban fuckboy
---
I also have this probalem. Disappointing really
---
Yes. I mostly play solo. 
---
I have the first two. I found treated at Watoga actually 
---
Yeah, this is absolutely right. I know for a fact that pre-nerf when aiming it was two individual and overlapped projectiles each hitting at 100% damage. That's what lead me to assert that it was two projectiles at 100%/25%, respectively. Two folks (including the OP in the other thread) are claiming that it's actually a _single_ projectile at 125% damage when aimed, though, which changes the math a fair bit in that case.
---
I am 100% certain it's not 62.5/62.5, though. That would result in barely an 8% damage gain for Two Shot, and the actual damage gained is significantly more than that.
---
Also, to your edit, that was definitely true in FO4, but I haven't retested that nuance in FO76.
---
I will sometimes shoot someone's wall just for a bounty, then I will repair said wall, I totally want them to attack me too though, but usually, if somebody is avoiding PvP like the plague, I will mess with them for a short bit, then go along my way to the next target.
---
"Just go out of your way to always have contingency plans and you'll never be caught off guard. While you record all 900+ hours of gameplay you should also narrate every little action including footsteps so they know it wasnt doctored footage." - you, probably
---
Bethesda is making a positive claim "you've duped items because we think you have too many of x item" thus they need to prove that he did it when he gives his reason for having it (which he absolutely has)
---
It isn't the players job to prove they're not cheating, it's bethesda's literal paid job to prove it. This is a paid for product, not your zero-tolerance high school.
---
\&gt;  Are the graphics better? 
---
At the same level with minor improvements in the form of some shaders. Many textures and models are copied 1 to 1.
---
\&gt;  How about building? 
---
Unlike Fallout 4, where you have different settlements and they have their own, independent budget, here you choose the only area in which you will build (albeit with the ability to move it later). The budget is much smaller, so many cool things for building are bought in the in-game store.
---
Plus, there are a lot of unnecessary conditions that were not there before. Often the game says that you can not put some construction, although visually it placed well.
---
Woah.. a whole 5 posts on a sub that represents 5% of the player base.
---
6 or so times now, finally scored a kill on that dodgy fucker
---
That's good information to have. This lines up with my numbers as-is. Were you aiming when firing, using VATS, or hip-firing?
---
I'm going to test that shortly when I take my lunch break.
---
What a joke.  Sore loser
---
Proving my point. Thank you. 
---
I have to say I'm not great at sharing.  A legendary glowing whatever (or 3) runs at me I get into a bit of a frenzy and shoot to kill lol.   I get killed a lot at whitesprings.
---
Everyone should be do happy I keep pacifist mode on at all times, I'm a lousy shot lol.
---
Glowing ghouls or super mutants with super sledges hit pretty darn hard, so I am sure no damage is reflected when I block their attacks because my weapon is also Instigating and I notice when I hit them the first time that they took no reflected damage whatsoever
---
Same, and trust me I am shooting at those flying giant bats all the time :D
---
I feel the same as Liquid and have the same weapons.. Although I just got Furious Exploding Gatling and it feels better than both the AA and TSE as long as I hit the target non stop.. 10 seconds it resets but still 
---
True, and I replied to someone else saying the same thing but I realized odds are we're trying to explain burden of proof to 12 year olds
---
Yeah, so this wasn‚Äôt a coding error; this was a conscious stealth nerf that hurt Bloodied builds. They just can‚Äôt seem to stop nerfing the game to death. 
---
yes, we do, and a thank you emote, and even more than that we need a friggin text chat
---
I'm not sure on TSE ones. Mine's TS and 10% damage when aiming. Personally, I'd trade all of the TSE weapons I've gotten for non explosive two shots. Explosive is annoying 
---
Lemme guess... you mashed A to get through the terms of service?
---
You "signed" an agreement. Have fun.
---
oh! :(
---
No, your link doesn't show that. Please stop making stuff up. There is one guy that said you could MAYBE get back the cost of the game. 
---
If you aren't trolling provide some real sources instead of twisting comments from some people on a message board that may or may not even be real lawyers from 6 years ago. 
---
U
---
Pretty sure I got that at the Watoga train station vendor
---
Aiming down sights 
---
Well first you say you have 1 character that level 650 which means you would have had to average of a level just over every hour (Which is not really possible to consistently maintain) unless you were using an exploit. Unless you are just talking about 900 hours in the last 30 days (Because it said those items were gathered in the last 30 days) which is also not possible because if you played 24 hours a day non stop for 30 days, you would only reach 720 hours....
---
i actually live about 30 minutes from here and have visited most of the areas in the game in real life alot of ot is acurate and nice its cool seeing all these areas in a game you grew up around 
---
Well then what is a good choice?  If TS is only good for a handful of weapons but worse for everything else then it's kinda shit.  TS weapons don't do enough damage anymore to compensate for how inaccurate they make some weapons.  My TS shotgun was really good but I had to stand 5 feet away from enemies to kill them but it did kill them.  Now I have to stand 5 feet away for a small bit of extra damage so it just isn't worth it, I'd rather use a non-legendary.  TS weapons were nerfed too hard.
---
Yeah I bought the playtime PA paint because I wanted the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Play‚Äù across my chest. It apparently doesn‚Äôt put the words on X-01
---
i actually asked a local person about whitespring..which is called greenbriar..they said the room are really expensive :(
---
&gt;burns stims tho if ur under heavy fire recommend using diluted
---
Are you saying this because you should keep a reserve of Diluted Stimpacks for manual activation, or is there a way you can make the Auto-Stim armor use those instead?
---
Cool, thanks, worth a shot. :)
---
thank you for continuing to do all this amazing work.
---
Is the "super" damage is in the adrenal reaction table power attacks?
---
Unfortunately there's no option to hide gamer tags. You cannot choose a server so if you want to role play it's best to find a group to play with that wants the same. You can join the server of anyone on your friends list.
---
This is amazing!
---
Can't change to in-game name, and you can't join worlds specificslly for roleplaying... but that doesn't stop me from roleplaying as a wasteland Don Quixote. You don't have to play a "meta" build to succeed in this game, unless you're really into PvP.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs one of the few places I know I‚Äôm guaranteed at least 3 legendaries and if that‚Äôs not a good enough reason then Idk what is.
---
The enemies at Uranium fever don't scale to your level. Not one of them is above   level l 40, which means not one weapon drop is either. 
---
There actually IS new bugs... for me at least. Up until this latest patch I've been lucky and haven't really experienced too many bugs outside of the common rad worms / sneak glitches. Currently I can't play even though I'd really like to because I'm missing all of my atom shop textures. The fixes that have been posted here have only worked to restore the player icons. In the meantime I am missing literally every piece of flooring in my CAMP, and any atom shop product that is left including my pipboy skin is bright neon pink. 
---
I really love this game.. and I've been lurking these forums since beta. I wish people were a little less combative in their replies and a little bit more compassionate to their fellow players who are experiencing issues. 
---
also, on that topic, one of the devs said we could be raiders, not with this fucking slap damage bullshit!  I say screw the PvP servers and get rid of the slap damage, those that don't want to engage can go into pacifist, which should also be changed so you take no damage from other players as well as deal none...
---
oh man never thought of that, we need to all go to the whitespring at the same time!
---
Yea the desktop bug is still a very annoying problem. I found out that it does close it self eventually, it just takes 5-10 mins lol. 
---
the brotherhood is better, it should be the brotherhood
---
They just released the datamined changelog: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asps77/fallout_76_v_1060_changelog_based_on_game_data/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
The only reason I don't have more ammo atm is because I don't have anything to spend it on, so there is no reason to farm more... it's like 200k caps worth of inventory.
---
80k @ 10k/hr is only 8 hours of farming. That's not a lot.
---
You're excellent at sarcasm and sure showed him.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
It's a meme now just avoid this sub until the Lego munchers move on. 
---
And lets not forget how fast the TSE breaks.. It's not even worth using it because it breaks so fast.. The AA last way longer. So efficiency is out the windows with TSE.
---
if not their biolgical age, certainly their intellectual one. lol all of these baseless and erroneous assumptions would be laughable if there werent real, decent, good heated people being fucked over in all of this. ive seem some really good people that were really great for the community just throw their damn hands up and permenantly quit over this. its tragic.
---
I tried to make this post an OP but reddit keeps telling me " something went wrong" im gonna paste it here cause its fitting. Its my RP guild and quest giver guide...
---
I expect this to be a long rambling post, with horrible spelling and formatting. Please bear with me. I will give some history then explain what the guild ive put together has been doing. I dont want recruits. I actually want rival/nuetral/ally guilds to pop up.
---
This is a guide. I want to run into other people doing this sort of thing. I haven't yet. Neither have any of my guildies. As far as we know, we are the only group providing quests, rewards, drama and sometimes death and failure to folks engaging in our roleplay. On PC at least.
---
[How it Started]
---
My buddy and I were end game ready. No content left that we really enjoyed. Kind of bored. Christmas 2018. I wanted to be a questgiver since day 1.  so i found a place with a dead NPC skeleton lady, with some unique decorations around her. I built a camp around her. Named her Carol. This was our first quest.
---
[Carols Quest]
---
So i built a room with a locked door around carol. Simple 2 story camp with 1 entrance. I made a murder mystery type thing.  Clues about carol having a disease and the home owner looking for a cure but unable to sleep due to carols screams. Eventually the clues lead you to the yard. Where the Player1 would find me. Manic. Mad. Crazy. Searching for someone with good news about my dear Carol. Id explain that i didnt like hearing bad news and had to bury the last person who accused carol of being lifeless. SHE CAN BE SAVED!
---
Player1 would have to gain my trust, be nice to carol or give her medicine and i would reward them with a perfectly preserved pie (that carol would "bake" while we watched tv for a short time) . ive had people sing to her. Drop stimpacks yada yada. 
---
We learned alot from the first quest, roleplay mechanics within fo76.  So we had "Hard fails". You pick the lock on carols door? I kill you for peeping at my wife. We needed to make it a bit easier for player1 to understand they were making the wrong moral choice with consequence. 
---
I like base building and the JUG videos came out around this time. So i made a beautiful castle in the lake NE of New Gad. The Kingdom of Gadlantis was born. 
---
Im going to explain some quest givers terminology then get back into Gadlantis quest lines and using the game mechanics like workshops to enhance RP. 
---
PLAYER1 - The real player doing our quests
---
PULL/ PULLING - Approaching strangers with the intent to lure them into your quests. - dont break character!!
---
Tag/tagging a workbench - going to an owned workbench to engage in pvp (Become a red target) with the owner. Not taking or claiming. Just tagging then leaving. You stay pvp flagged with the player.
---
[Kingdom of GADLANTIS]
---
I built a round castle with a small foyer. A locked gate in the foyer and a painting on the wall of the foyer.In small letters, It reads "A KINGS FATE: FIND ((my ign)) , REQUEST AN AUDIENCE WITH THE KING" this allows players to find me in game and ask me to meet the king initiating our first quest line. 
---
So this castle functions as our base of operations. In a high traffic area for mid to low level players, where we arent bothering folks grinding with our RP over area mic. I don't like to pull from whitesprings, nuke zones or watoga to be polite. The king resides there and most of our quests can be given from the castle. 
---
[The kings quests]
---
Basic pull - run to a player1 on the map "our kingdom is in peril! We need a hero! Are you that hero our kingdom needs?" Come to Gadlantis and speak with our king! Perhaps you can save the kingdom. 
---
We have more advanced pulls with mini questlines. Basically some scoundrel greasers roam the edges of the kingdom looking for junk. But they are misled youth's.... Anyway im getting ahead of myself. Lets stick to the basic pull and move along. 
---
So player1 comes to the castle and is in awe of how cool we are. "YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR WILL, HOWEVER YOU MUST PROVE YOUR STRENGTH IN ORDER TO BE GRANTED AN AUDIENCE WITH OUR KING. CLAIM THE WORKSHOP TO THE WEST IN THE NAME OF GADLANTIS. PROVE YOUR STRENGTH AND YOU MAY BE GRANTEd AN AUDIENCE WITH OUR KING!!"
---
Player1 goes to take the work shop. Whe  they get back they get some rewards, get to enter the castle and speak to the king who sends them on more quests. "You have proven your strength, now i must know if i can trust you"...Not just fetch quests. We strive foe dialog, interraction, moral choice, difficulty and risk. We kill alot of Player1's. People want a living NPC that can react to any choice they make. Improv is a big part of being an NPC. 
---
So, we usually ALWAYS make player1 take a workbench. This allows us to tag it during the drama of the second quest. One of us will be a villian, misled youth, misunderstood monster, someone that player1 may or may not need to kill. During our interraction with player1, someone on our team will tag the workbench allowing player1 to choose to kill or fight our NPC (us) during the second quest. The king may not like player1 killing an innocent or misunderstood foe.
---
Its really important to understand how to flag people doing quests as pvp active so they can enjoy the drama, danger, yada yada. We tone it down for low levels. Our "bossfight" might be a lvl 150 guy with a lvl 5 weapon.
---
[Guild structure]
---
Our group content is giving quests. Everyone is encouraged to design a quest and utilize their CAMP as part of it. Lore linking it to the castle makes sense but isnt nessecary. We have sub factions of mothmen and other zeolots for example. We dry run quests with members who try to "stump" the quest giver by taking the unexpected choice. The first rule of improv applies. Always say yes. Go along with it. We "wing" alot of quests to work out the kinks. 
---
Once again im not recruiting, i dont need/want members, im trying to share what we do so maybe others can do the same.id like to see other RP factions giving quests. Im not giving much away, just enough to get you guys going. My guild has at least 3 hours of custom quest content. 
---
[Gushing reviews]
---
One of the best parts of doing this is the player1 reaction. Feelsgood. People have said its the most fun they have had. They laugh and clearly have fun doing our quests. Complement us like crazy after completing 3 quests. People who engage really enjoy it.  Use soundboards. Use music and sound fx. 
---
People will turn you down. Pulling is hard. Its a crapshoot. Some people dont have mics, dont wanna roleplay, speak another language. Half the people wont take the quests. Sometimes you walk into a raider trap. 
---
Id like to see more RP groups so this was a quick guide. Have fun with it and feel free to AMA.  I dont wanna give too much away but i think ive shared enough to get the some gears turning. I havent met another real RP group. I really want to come across other people doing this. Good luck. 
---
Oh yeah. FYI. This puts a target on your back. My castle was nuked 6 times this week. Raided by gangs 4 times. So make sure you are "junk rich" before approaching every player on the map with roleplay. WHO NUKES NEW GAD ANYWAY? LOL
---
You are missing my point entirely dude. Ultracite ammo is a lot harder to craft. If you can craft 100k ultracite ammo I will be legitimately impressed though.
---
Their track record is a whole one nerfing patch, games only been out 3 months get some perspective.
---
Does that change to the prewar safe mean no more stimpaks every time you log on?
---
But then it would have worked with any aid.
---
No way currently to see character names instead of of gamer tags, alas. No real way to find role playing worlds, as server assignment is random every time you login unless you join a friend from the social tab. That said, I have a role playing build and I love it - check out the following sub for RPing :)   
---
[r/FO76roleplay](https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76roleplay/)

this is bad. I'm still missing marsupial.

---
    0.436318212400871
---
According to that math AA is about 17% better than TSE.
---
It's a visual bug. Once replied you get the buff even though it doesn't show up on your status screen.
---
i wishhhhh i could scrap legendaries..i could barely give them away sometimes
---
no it shouldn't, the ability to breath in the air does not prevent you from getting airborne toxins, just as the ability to breath in water doesn't prevent you from getting waterborne toxins, just because fish breath in water does not make them immune to the toxins in that water...
---
Is it pure bug fixes though? We've had a few 5GB patches, that size for what they claim to be changing is unbelievable. Surely it must be Atom Store content bloating it? 
---
Find something that is fun to you and do that rather than focusing on grinding for legendaries. Unless that is your fun, then you do you. Probably half those hours can be assigned to building camps for me.
---
Checked when I got home, it is bugged. I even asked someone to check in discord and they were like "nope same for me" and then "cool thanks for fear mongering" at least I was able to post the fix by then
---
Thank you for your contribution but personally I am still expecting a fix.
---
They have 'reworked' it considerably and said nothing about it, the least they can do is fix it.
---
'cure mutations and reapply' in my eyes is not a fix. 
---
Major.
---
I...dont think that word means what you think it means...
---
I'm not sure what the vendor charges.  But the RNG is so poor it's almost not worth checking to see if the vendor has them.
---
On FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar they typically average for around 2,500 caps each.
---
Thanks, this is the answer I wanted.
---
Good to know.  That was the last thing I did last night before turning in.  Frustration got the better of me.
---
Beth doesn't read this reddit anymore. Face it, its over
---
Well, damn. I think the bones of the game are a good construction kit for a roleplaying world... but it kind of involves everyone being on the same page.
---
...and convincing my friends to even *try* the game, after all the online bitching and drama is an impossibility. I am doing my best to play the game now "in character", and I'm having a blast with it, so I'll continue. Every now and then, a player comes along that "plays along". 
---
Too bad about the gamertags, though. Seems like it would be an easy fix, curious as to why it's not an option, like Zenimax did in ESO.
---
FYI they haven't been duped to shit.  I'm in FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar all the time.  It's rare that you see them listed for sale, and they generally go for around 2,500 caps.  If they were duped like crazy, you'd see that crash down to 250 caps each.
---
+0.76
---
I agree completely.  Im just impatient and didn't want to wait three weeks before they get around to it.  Since I have most of the recipes that we're needed to experiment, I went for it.
---
Man...you fuckers really need to get girlfriends lol
---
that used to scare me all the time when i leveled up..but then i got used to it..i miss that
---
If you're in a group, whoever lands the killing blow gets credit.  Everyone else does not.  Not sure why that is.
---
If it's more broken than that, sorry I don't have any more helpful tips.....lol
---
If only I could craft serums this would be possible, unfortunately I bought mine so I gotta wait and see if they fix it. Cant afford to keep re buying. 
---
Well, according to the [changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asps77/fallout_76_v_1060_changelog_based_on_game_data/?utm_source=reddit-android), even if they didnt break adrenal reaction, they still stealth nerfed it.
---
Assuming they tried stealth nerfing it, fucked up the code, and broke it all together. Queue slow clap
---
Seems to imply that it‚Äôs going to stop being a mutation and implemented on a perk card for the sake of balance the game 
---
Ha! 
---
Thanks for your help. I will aim to maintain the first number now if I can and get used to playing without power armor, will suck down the rads and use the decontamination arches frequently. Not been well so have had five days off FO76, nice to take a break actually.
---
From that perspective, I agree. I was more saying that from Bethesda's perspective something that actively changes the difficulty of the game in such a way is more likely to be considered cheating than something like the main menu music replacer or any of the "realistic reshade" mods.
---
Mothman really likes to hang out near the bridge at Charleston Station, sometimes he doesn't even fly away when you approach so you can pet him.
---
76 is like ESO With a fallout skin even has dragons !
---
I think I know who the 900 hours guy is in game and if he is who I think he is then the guy spends like ten hours a day running SBQ and another ten running mid level players through farming content, while having played from Beta with a group of very dedicated players that have since quit the game from boredom after they found virtually everything there is to find. 
---
It sure didn't seem like it was nerfed to me after I got it up and running again.  My weapons were fully restored to their original power.  
---
Nope, two shot and anti-armor are both 1st prefixes (along with bloody, furious, suppressor, etc)
---
Its all good brother.  You still gave me some solid information. Which I greatly appreciate.
---
So the customer is the problem for being impatient with a faulty product? Is that what you are saying?
---
&gt;The bottom line is this. They are trying. They aren't getting it all perfect every time. But they are trying.
---
The should have tried earlier. I'm not expecting a new game to be bug free and perfectly balanced, but what they delivered was a scandal. Sure they are trying now, but they are still a long way away from making up for the rocky start.
---
Please tell me this: What other kind of products would you be okay with this kind of behavior? Cereals, smartphone, clothes? Cars?
---
Bethesda has the same serial liar issue,  and has shown time and time again they use faulty programming......something required for those analytics and metrics you tote.
---
I am not saying everyone is guilty or innocent, but I'm inclined to believe some are innocent just like Bethesda has rightfully banned a lot of them.
---
You instead assume that all are guilty based on the premise that Bethesda has a solid reputation with online gaming.....which you don't. 
---
But logic is not something you can teach and basic deductive REASONING is something you have shown incapable of, so good luck out there in the real world.
---
watoga and harpers ferry, server hop till your eyes bleed.
---
Pretty sure that refers to the Strange in Numbers boosted version of the perk. 
---
And bonus question: How does lobber interact with two shot?
---
This is beyond stupid, it still functions this way. The weapons I've modded to auto-pistols like my 10mm and Pipe pistol get buffs from Gunslinger but not from Guerrilla / Expert Guerrilla. 
---
Jesus that's dumb
---
What I'm saying is I could make all the other ammo in less than a week if I was on the game twelve hours a day farming, so it's possible.
---
I'm not saying he's legit, I'm saying it's not a smoking gun.
---
The Cranberry Glades sure look absolutely stunning in real life! 
---
yes, but way cheaper, I mean 18 fucking dollars for a paintjob!  but for real I need that for my X-01
---
You ignored every point I made. If you're optimizing your damage output, you're using Adrenal Reaction. End of story.
---
Sorry, Bethesda doesn't understand what that means.
---
They're 100% focused on bugs, nerfs, hunting dupers right now.  New content is the furthest thing from their minds.  The community manager even confirmed it in multiple replies.
---
Its frightening that the mindset of "just prove a negative" is so prevalent in this subreddit. Companies like Bethesda are getting away with more now because their target demographic is growing up in a time where companies are in charge instead of the consumer.
---
Remember when we gave Bethesda crap over trying to sell horse armor? Now they get away with much worse and I only see a few people calling them out on it.
---
They didn't say that two of his *characters* have that much ammo. They said two of his *accounts*, meaning a combination of everything on all the characters.
---
Do you wear operative underarmor?
---
Funny. I'm reading this sipping coffee from my Boston mug I bought while walking the freedom trail... FO4 for the win.
---
Hitting the same level-wall here too - Currently Level 22, and doing the "Forging a Legend" quest to finish part of the Mistress of Mysteries, but everytime I go near Whitespring, I get my ass fed to me on a plate by level 65+ ghouls..  
---
Today, I was lucky and managed to lure them to the front and let the various 'bots take care of them..  
---
Only to get near the location and run into a level 92 Glowing Deathclaw!  
---
Nope! Nope! Nope!  
---
Yet went to Sugar Grove, all the way across the Savage Devide, and the enemies are all Level 5.. 
---
what?   
---
I have:
---
Talons + Twisted Muscles + Adrenal Reaction + T3 Bloody mess + T3 ironfist + radicool and full unyielding with +2 str in some of those pieces + T1 adrenaline and my B. D'claw only does around 2400  (w/arenaline) with the B. mole miner only doing around 1200. am I missing out on Strange in number multipliers or something?
---
If you find things you like in the game that are OP, please be quiet about it.
---
Bethesda has been steadily nerfing things people like (White Knight, Martial Artist, Workshop Output AND Defense).
---
Don't let this be the next casualty on the Fun Police's hit list :)
---
This comment has just reminded me of a horrific Fallout 4 experience...
---
I built an awesome little BoS fort at the Red Rocket south of Sanctuary. I haven't a clue where it came from, perhaps Carla, but I ended up with a Brahmin in the middle of my base. The constant mooing was driving me nuts. I tried pushing it, when that didn't work I tried giving it a nudge (melee). Paladin Danse then immediately turned hostile towards it and turned it into a permanent glowing pile of ash. I had to redesign half the base so I could hide it under a concrete foundation. Even then at certain times of the day I could see the red vapour clipping through. I will never forgive Danse for that...
---
I bought the shielded enclave under armour plans from the enclave production vendor. You couldn't buy directly as you had to buy the previous updrade levels first
---
As a lifelong West Virginian, this state is so beautiful in some areas. I think the game did some regions a lot of justice or improved upon them (Camden Park is so much crappier in real life and Flatwoods is mostly gas stations), especially with the Greenbrier/White Springs, but some areas missed the mark. The New River Gorge Bridge was the big one for me. I raft the New River as often as I can (I think I'm up to fourteen), and there is nothing like coming around a river bend and seeing that behemoth bridge in all its beauty. And the height from that bridge is over 800 feet, so you don't fully get the majesty in the game.
---
So if you want to visit us, please come! We have problem people, sure, but most people are good. We had a huge derecho that cut off power to half the state years back, and the mayor of Fayetteville was out in his yard stopping travelers to come share in a meal since his freezer meat was going to go bad.
---
Also, fun fact, the Greenbrier is owned by our governor. He's... interesting. Just Google "Governor Justice cow patty" and you'll see how we keep up our redneck reputation on the national stage. 
---
I don't know their CRM system specifically, but generally, support reps won't bother to look at closed tickets unless some issue comes up with your account later that would require them to do more research into the history of your account.

---
yeah it happened to me while i was on ps4..none of my armor was chameleon..so i jumped servers and i re appeared
---
Eat my shorts.
---
We've been asking for more events.
---
All they have to do is lower the event cooldown timers.
---
They've proven very resistant to the idea so far.
---
When will they learn that stealth nerfing isn't healthy for their game. It's better to be upfront with the gamers.
---
This happened to my team too. We had to keep entering/exiting power armor to indicate where we were on the road we were traveling. Hated it!
---
Fast travel bug. Happens to me and my teammates often when we fast travel to the same event or location and use social to fast travel TO PLAYER ... not sure if that has any effect on bug replication, but it's how we travel when we experience it.

I could solo the queen with 2k 5mm Vampiric Gatling Gun + 3x3 Heavy Gunner (140 dmg, Stabilized 3): 75% on-ground point blank range. I fail the queen with 10+ people around. There could be some hidden buff as 300 DR should get her killed in 1k rounds. Also her DR display doesn't change with the number of people joining. Maybe her health pool does the actual scaling from 32k+16k?
---
I wont be on until later tonight
---
As pointed out by another poster the change was intentional.  +20% damage at 70% health is now 0%, \~+32% at 50% health is now +12%  
---
Not naive, been playing since beta just actually able to afford them but no desire to purchase because there was no need stop turn nothing into something. 
---
Confirmed, the Adrenal Reaction mutation DOESN‚ÄôT work! They have to make hotfixes, because waiting for the next patch is lame!
---
It is not "cut". The code is refactored, but the main functionality (with tweaked values) stays the same.
---
A person can criticize the game and that's fair. Like I said, they have clearly made mistakes. They don't even have to give constructive criticism. 
---
Saying the game sucks, isn't criticism, it's bashing. More so if that's all they say. 
---
And you are right, this particular subreddit has been made toxic by game bashers. One was gloating how so many have been driven away to the filthycausals subreddit, and now they can freely bash the game. 
---
That is correct
---
Ironically, you can't even  prove that you did *not* do something. That's simply impossible. 
---
At some point in the near future
---
They did it to me too. I just typed a huge post on another reddit forum about more or less the same topic. It‚Äôs not fair how they are going about this crackdown. There are so many honest players who‚Äôve been banned now. I‚Äôm like you I had a shit ton of ammo, but all types unfortunately and a matching gun almost for every bullet type lmao. I never duped, never cheated/exploited once, just worked hardcore, bought a few items on discord and farmed my ass off to make the ammo. I got every prime receiver from farming and made them ASAP then did the ammo grinding with Ammosmitj and Super Duper. It‚Äôs not hard to accumulate a large quantity of ammo or grenades or anything to be honest with the right crafting perk cards. They really need to fix this now. I submitted a ticket two days ago, haven‚Äôt heard back yet. I even posted on their main twitter page about my email. I didn‚Äôt play for a month or so. No I‚Äôm stuck playing GTA and getting blown up by flying motorcycles constantly :( my friends and I don‚Äôt know what to do now as Fallout was our go to usually üò≠
---
Lolz I didn‚Äôt accuse him of cheating. Asking if he‚Äôs angry that he was caught..
---
There‚Äôs plenty of banned folk saying they got banned but since they hadn‚Äôt played didn‚Äôt care.
---
I got a mule account too, and amazingly enough, still playing.
---
Don‚Äôt get your panties in a bind if folks ask a question. Put something out, expect a response.
---
Finally, afaik folks get banned for breaking the TOS. It‚Äôs not my problem to educate folks on the terms of an ELA.  Folks who TLDR aren‚Äôt my responsibility.
---
This is how I read it
---
Not talking about the other ammo. I'm talking about the ultracite ammo. Next time you play go look at the material required.
---
I appreciate the effort you've put into this, mate; thumbs up.  
---
However, as an in-game owner of around 20 various auto rifles and combat shotguns (on PC, no VATS, just ADS), I can safely say that recoil on e.g. TSE Combat Rifle vs Quad Explosive Combat rifle is night and day - by the time you finish the mag on TSE, you have moved your mouse so much down the table it's about to fall down :)   
---
I was absolutely smacked, when I acquired said QE CombRifle, how much smoother the shooting is. Also AAE Handmade is dead on target (vs TSE) and you can very succesfully use Explosive CombShotgun with long scope and Skeet Shooter perk - in TSE variant it's nigh impossible, though it's a great panic-mode carpet bombing weapon, no doubt it.
---
I‚Äôve never had the burger, I always the the Lafayette. I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called, it‚Äôs the chicken cordon blue sandwich. You can‚Äôt forget about the homemade ketchup either. 
---
Theres more to do in West Virginia in a motel than the entirety of Fallout 76.
---
Go to Bahamas, Jamaica, or Hawaii.  Anywhere really, West Virginia is a retirement state if anything, but it certainly is not a vacation.
---
Yep, I am.
---
Totally Fanboy'd this title up in the first month.  Not as much in the 2nd month, but still some Fanboy.  Now in the 3rd month with zero new content and all my friends are gone..........totally not a fanboy anymore.
---
Ok... been busy collecting :-) let me know if you want the last leg crafted... 
---
I hate sharing the best secret but if thay escalation doesn't work look up corporate emails. Some websites publish them others do not but you can often find them anyways. Email the ceo office or consumer support. They have staffers answering and checking emails.
---
ATT wouldn't help me revert my phone plan for days and every tier of support. Emailed  executive support and it was fixed first thing next morning. 
---
Will the upcoming Roadmap also include info on Private Servers?
---
Also all the Cryptids are real urban legends from Appalachia.
---
Mothman especially 
---
Yeah. T45/T51/T60 &amp; raider.
---
Good job proving you dont know what a fact, is but hey that collage copy paste degree is working out for you. 
---
I asked for proof, evidence. You refused to provide any. Hence, not a fact that 900 guy was duping since there is no evidence. You did a good job showing how utterly reluctant you are to even address the initial context. 
---
If you are gonna play that often I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to get mad about content after just 3 months. I‚Äôm not hating, you do you. But I think the average player has stuff to do still. And considering all the other fixes going on and that it takes time and resources to develop quality content, I think waiting until March is totally reasonable. If you marathoned the game and burnt yourself out, just play another game. 
---
What‚Äôs coming in March?
---
But everybody and their moms knows that.
---
There‚Äôs numerous posts wording better all the bugs and problems while keeping it civil.
---
He have the right to be angry at Beth but most peoples are exhausted by the constant negativity ( not just about FO76)
---
What part of West Virginia is this? 
---
PLOT TWIST: They're both chicks.
---
As much as I'd like full Brotherhood presence, I think that it'd be better if they had remote telepresence through getting a remote control of a facility.  In the main quest in F76, you hear from the Holotapes that the satellites they were using to communicate with the HQ on the west coast were failing, so that's why there's no current communication.  Maybe if they got some land lines together that work intermittently, they could communicate with us for the occasional mission to do.
---
Also, I think a small 'rescue' force sent to help might be worthwhile, the person who sets up a small base and recruits the players as new forces to send out on missions.  Since he'd have limited power of the players, we'd have more flexibility on how we handle the missions.
---
And yet when you catch someone like that cheating everyone is like "you just suck he can't be cheating he is just skilled." 
---
See, you are an example of exactly what I've pointing out.
---
I clearly think Bethesda is part of the problem. It's even in the title. 
---
But you seem so angry over a video game, you are quick to assume it means something I never once even said.
---
So please, put your anger away. It's clouding your logic. 
---
Here's your answer. There are many products that have fucked up like this, and then fixed it. MANY. And survived. 
---
Maybe
---
Lolz downvoting for being entitled 
---
So we only have to kill 1? The behemoth also didn't register for me.
---
We already have MODUS, we need more faction 'leaders' to deal with to have actual factions matter in game.
---
Shhh....
---
I used to have some friends that would drop 3 nukes on prime non-stop all night.  3 nukes, change server, 3 nukes, etc, etc, etc.
---
They're all gone now.  All offline.
---
No new content, they're bored.
---
That‚Äôs no glitch. That‚Äôs a big ass bug that should never have passed QA testing.
---
I love my company‚Äôs Director of QA. She keeps us from unknowingly shipping broken code. If we do ship broken code, we at least know it‚Äôs broken, lol. 
---
Clever. Thanks! I'll try that next time.
---
Don't forget a load of aluminium and springs to repair that .50 cal after 2 clips.
---
Yeah, it was probably a couple weeks ago. She crash landed and died on the edge and just slowly slid in.
---
Price?
---
Ha great thought...except, with the current state of the game ( bugs, core issues, etc ) they should be patching this game every week!
---
I enjoy being a sort of random encounter when I come across other players in-game, eerily staring through CAMP windows, revving my chainsaw on the outskirts or playing creepy samples over the mic, like [this](https://youtu.be/8hFaAk_zfOk)...
---
I had to google that. I've never played Elder scrolls
---
If my gf gets on before I get home I'll have her get it.
---
Do TS weapons break more frequently because it's 2 bullets being shot instead of one?  If so, firing a fully repaired TS versus firing a fully repaired AA until the point of weapon breaking will likely show that AA does more damage, over time.
---
you mean you max level crappy lever action riffle?
---
Did they hotfix adrenal reaction yet? 
---
Or is this actually another stealth nerf :/
---
Flatwoods Monster doesn't leave completely, just transports around the area, look around next time, I've killed about 6 of them.
---
If you or a friend got banned and you felt righteous about it, you would do everything you can through the proper channels to remedy it.
---
You are simply casting doubt for the sake of it.
---
Why would you care?
---
My friends and I aren't banned, and we don't care about all the crocodile tears.
---
If you aren't involved, at all, why are you vocalizing doubt on the ban methods?
---
Because it appears all you want to do is cast doubt on these actions and decisions in an effort to damage good faith.
---
Welcome to Warframe.
---
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE BOIS!
---
And he has fun in buggy games
---
I'm lvl 157 and I've had 3 encounters,  one right outside the Charleston station around lvl 100, one at Berkley Springs workshop at roughly same level while I was claiming it, and once in the southeastern part of the map between R n G station and the fissure site.  Quite the elusive bugger... 
---
Are you feeling ok?
---
Sure but you're way overestimating how many people do that.
---
If they bring back Blackbird, I'll riot. It was limited time. If you missed it, sorry bub.
---
It's like releasing a pre-order reward later. Not cool.
---
&gt; This isn't even a post defending Bethesda. 
---
this is  100% a post defending Bethesda
---
&gt; Maybe some of you need to stop being so entitled 
---
Imagine thinking expecting a company to release a game you paid for in a complete state that doesn't require 700 patches to fix all the bugs is being entitled. 
---
&gt; Since the last Inside the Vault, I've seen many posts about new content. It's coming. Besides the Survival mode, the new PvE content that's going to be added is called Wild Appalachia 
---
Imagine if instead of having to 1000 bugs they were just working on new content this whole time.
---
I've never understood these posts defending Bethesda with the whole "They are trying to fix all the bugs!" as if they didn't knowingly release the game with all of the bugs in it. Bethesda shouldn't get extra credit for fixing things that should have been fixed prior to launch.
---
Lies.
---
how the hell did they manage this. seriously. the first time with rad worms was bad enough but this got to be a joke.
---
it's like they purposely deleted a whole bunch of flags. for no real reason.
---
Omg hilarious!
---
Right, and I wouldn't argue that everything should be handed to you. It's more about finding the sweet spot where you're doing just the right amount of grinding and getting just the right amount of reward. Right now it's leaning way too much on the grinding. There are also issues with how certain items are available that encourages both server hopping and gobbling up all of a specific item. For example, if you need or want a lot of fusion cores, you can spend an hour going from spawn location to another on one world, go to another and repeat, and suddenly dozens of players no longer can get fusion cores. If you do the same behavior the next day and the next, it becomes worse.  I use that as an example because more often then not every fusion core generator I find has already had its core taken (I don't really care that much since I don't use power armor much, though).
---
OK-est mouth harp performer
---
Visit WV!
---
Then riot.  What do we care?  Hope they bring it back even cheaper than before just to make you angrier.
---
For real ??? Lmao if its true üòÇüòÇ
---
does it only work on bloodied? adrenal reaction should affect all weapons‚Äô damage so did you check if other weapons were affected too?
---
I wish it was. 
---
Yup. My tse black powder is a fucking hammer. And as sneak sniper build i use long range so vats is a joke to me. 
---
I use vats on molerats. And to look for mines.
---
I thought my mom was the only person that says cripe
---
No, it's a post attacking people like you, that can't read and even when they do, all they are doing is thinking about what they want to say, which is seldom connected to the actual post.
---
In short, you are simply looking for posts to be able to say the same stupid shit over and over. 
---
Because that's also what being entitled is about. You think only what you have to say is worth while and only your money matters. if you don't think it's worth what you paid, no one else should either.
---
And when they do like it, you attack them because you can't handle someone disagreeing with you.
---
It's that simple. 
---
It's not useless tho....
---
That's not what the notes said. The clean clown outfit is a purchasable item from the atom store.. when wearing the clean outfit, it wasn't completing the mission.. they fixed that
---
I do have strange in numbers. I'm also running the full suite of one/unarmed melee and maxed Nerd rage. Keep myself radiated just below half health so a single hit triggers the rage. After the patch though it seems to be hitting for 944 with nerd rage active, solo and 1.4 when in a group. I think my unyielding armor has a bit of play as it's all +1 to strength so when everything kicks in I'm at high 20's low 30's coupled with the damage cards in strenght
---
Lots of people hate on this game but it's slowly becoming my favorite Fallout because of all the accurate WV history and locations they capture. No longer living in WV, this game takes me back home (country roads)
---
I used free atoms to buy it too - up until that point I didn't really feel like buying much from the atom store.
---
Yongs just abit shit, fallout 76 is definitely worse though....
---
Cool. so i just need to stop eating and drinking. healing factor negates non combat health drain. and in combat i mow down every enemy
---
&gt;!they should rename it to "Ravenous hunger" if it becomes it's own mutation!&lt;
---
I've encountered only a few Mothmen at level 130+, the Glowing ones, and Vengeful ones stay &amp; fight, the Stalking version does the Hit &amp; Run thing, I've only managed to kill one of those.
---
I would‚Äôve liked to see this as well, but it‚Äôs likely a server issue of loading two camps together at the same time..
---
Hope they figure it out because I want this so badly!
---
Has nothing to do with your opinion and everything to do with the fact you‚Äôre blatantly trolling for responses.....then get mad when you get your response. 
---
Happened to me last night, at Whitespring Golf Club.  I was the only person on the map, vats showed nothing.  I jumped servers and a few minutes later it started happening again!!  I just logged out and turned the game off for the night.  Hope this isn't ramping up.  
---
What frustrated me more was that I had just given a nice legendary Handmade to another random player rather than sell it the vendor for a rediculous low price.  I kept thinking no good dead goes unpunished.
---
It has gotten better. I played for six hours on the same server yesterday and only got kicked once. Other days I won't get kicked at all. The game crashes more often than getting kicked from the server. I'm on PS4
---
I wish this was a mobile app!
---
If you don't want some high level player killing you in one shot, then don't take any workshops, dude. It's part of PVP, you have to deal with it
---
+karma
---
This drives me bananas. I'm not hearing impaired but I keep subtitles on because I have a learning disability. You'd think in a game where they have no NPCs they could take the time to subtitles what little audio there is properly. 
---
should've mentioned nerd rage, and rads is basiaclly the go to method of keeping health @20%
---
Uhg. I can feel your sadness. I got a guitar sword with junkies... on my sneak sniper build.
---
How about overlapping nuke zones resulting in higher radiation and more varied and higher more dangerous spawns?
---
A double nuked Whitesprings with SBQ type spawns (or just loads of irradiated animals and creatures, not necessarily scorched) would be fun. 
---
Toxic valley is the closest thing at the moment. Up around Grafton. 
---
Here you go. There's a lamp in the middle for scale. The billboards seem to need to be hard-wired to light up, rather than just being in range of a pylon.
---
Also, it may not mean anything but when you buy it, it appears as two known items in the atom shop, rather than one.

Hey - this post is amazing!  
---
But to get more visibility on the stealth nerf, maybe you should make an additional post specifically about that with the code?
---
I feel it is a big issue that may be lost in such a detailed post. 
---
Especially since the Bethesda community peeps are all "oh my, adrenal doesn't work? Wow!". 
---
Either way, thank you for the hard work! 
---
&gt; TS = ((125/300)^.366 ).5
---
&gt; AA = ((100/150)^.366 ).5
---
And you claim that TS &gt; AA
---
But that means you're claiming that 125/300 &gt; 100/150 and that just aint so.
---
Thank you very muchüôå
---
I'm not angry at the video game. I bought it, I'm playing it , and I'm waiting for Beth to fix it.
---
I'm a little bit angry at apologetic behavior like in this post. You can't give ANY part of this mess to the customer. If you are selling a product in that state, you need to get the feeling that they can't get away with this a second time. If we all go like "oh well, I'm sure it'll get fixed eventually" Starfield will ship in exactly the same state. 
---
It might be that many products were fucked up like this. Then it wasn't okay MANY times.
---
Lolz just cuz you don‚Äôt understand stuff doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong.  It just means 
---
You can‚Äôt get past concepts that don‚Äôt agree with.
---
YOU, are the reason why you can‚Äôt understand stuff.
---
If it helps, stop thinking in terms of yourself! 
---
THEN YOULL UNDERSTAND.
---
I do believe that some people can be deluded, (* warped perception) entitled (*right / claim) and stupid about things they dont understand.
---
Yeah, it's like, +150%
---
Not sure, but I heard it a display bug, or a bug that fixes itself on relog (but still has the display wrong).
---
Good info, thanks. I might finish up Res Dead and Spider-Man then give FO another chance
---
Then why don't they say that, instead their community people seem 'shocked' it has stopped working. 
---
What company is this?
---
And what proof would you accept? There is more than 1 person in there saying that they could get the value of the game reimbursed.
---
Also, do you have ANY type of education on contract law? Because I do as part of my business, and banning someone for no reason absolutely falls under a breach of contract. 
---
By banning him even though he broke none of the stated rules they are the ones who aren't holding up to their contractual obligations. He purchased the game under the assumption that he would have access to play the game, BSG themselves broke that obligation by removing his ability to access the game he paid for. 
---
This is really first year stuff.

I‚Äôm staying at the greenbrier next weekend! So excited

Thanks for all the detail, you've effectively proved u/YaBoiDannyTanner is wrong because...

    125/300 &lt; 100/150
---
There's a mod for that if you're on PC. But maybe you could get banned for it.
---
Oooh ok thanks
---
.
---
BUSS DOWN THALENIAA, 
---
I wanna see u bust down
---
Yes I think I do. What you have done how ever is claim I'm wrong without providing any counter examples or proof. So not really helping your argument here. 
---
I just went through and killed each listed once and still not completed so guess one more bug to deal with. Yay.
---
Everything that sucks from Fallout 4 is in Fallout 76 and everything that is good isnt 
---
It's not the end of the world, but I thought they patched this?
---
&gt; **about**
---
I'm not saying nonlegendaries are bad üòÇ How do you think I'm saying that? I'm just saying TS is superior to AA.
---
hey everyone, this guy is the perfect consumer. Sell him anything and he's too dumb to know better.
---
Did you know that there's a quest for the t45?
---
I‚Äôm guessing they really never had an idea how many effects could you stack together making level 50 as god like as level 200 
---
lol mothman.....
---
That's actually an excellent idea
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the single projectile thing be easily testable with some PVP against serendipity perk?
---
Activation animations seem to stack. Though I think they did mention changing one. If you shoot someone with a TS ADS and they take damage with a serendipity activation, then they dodged one attack and got hit with the other. Two animations would mean they dodged two projectiles.

Why am I suspended????????? Gamer tag is the same as my Reddit. I never duped or cheated. I never did a single thing dirty in Fallout 76 and yet I‚Äôm suspended? Why? I never even held over 20k in any inventory category let alone 100,000. I know I had lots of ammo but that‚Äôs freaking normal for a lot of players. I farmed I grinded and I crafted. Anything else I owned was recieved through Farming caps and trading with friendly players. I‚Äôve already submitted a ticket to you guys and posted on Twitter. Please take my suspension away as I‚Äôm missing out on the best patch update so far. I‚Äôm really upset and want to be able to play my favourite game again! I‚Äôve had to resort to GTA online, a game series I haven‚Äôt touched for 6 years coz I got bored of it. I‚Äôd rather be killed by mutants then some dick flying around on a motorcycle with rockets any day! Please reconsider the suspension on my account I‚Äôm begging you guys!

---
Just because they say something is coming at an unknown date doesnt dismiss the complaints about it taking so fucking long
---
It's like if you waited an hour for your food at a restaurant, and someone says "dont complain, the waitress said it is still coming"
---
4 months is the standard of how long it takes to receive dlc on a complete offline game, that's unacceptable for a live service game launched with so little content
---
Over 3 months for a roadmap is a total disaster for a live service game where people are supposed to be playing new content perpetually
---
it's reliant on the servers. depends on how smooth the connection is.
---
if you're the first on the server right after they come back from maintenance you'll see everything loads 10 times as fast.
---
&gt;I think I'm gonna give Warframe a try. 
---
Nice to see a new Tenno joining us. If you need help feel free to hit me up.
---
What's wrong with adrenal reaction? 
---
Where is the disease cure? I had no idea about that. 
---
Would be good, how do we know that though? Any idea what the average age of a world is?
---
Unfortunately I think you're screwed.  They used to be a random chance at both Grafton Vendors (train station and the in-town one).  Now they're in neither.
---
Your best bet is to go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and try to find players with them there.  I sold all of mine for 2k each plan.  Chances are they're higher now as traders quit the game and more plans are not available.
---
I've only done it once and had the same experience.i assumed it was a known broken quest. I can't keep up with all the things that don't work right
---
The industries def structured differently. They probably don't have a director for quality but a few QA testers (that tend to not be tied to the studio). 
---
I think the main problem with their remove/ban/suspend approach is the criteria they used seem to not be nearly so simple as what they present. This might simply be a case of a support team using a macro that was either not written for this specific action, was written by someone who didn't understand the specifics, or they were provided with poor information.
---
One other interesting point you made was putting the onus on the developers. If duping causes such a problem with stability, why is that? Items stack, so why should a stack of 100,000 items matter any different than a stack of 1000? Why does "weight" matter for the stash when weight is simply a property of an item. What would affect performance to me is not how many items you have in a single given stack but how many different items. This is how Elder Scrolls Online storage works, and it makes sense. With FO76, it's like each item in a stack is still a separate row in a db table rather than a single row for one item with a quantity field.

Hunger GameÔºÅ
---
Yup, I confused hardened with dense. Your link is 404d ;(
---
Happened to my team 4 times last night, getting in and out of PA fixed it for us at least.
---
Interesting idea.  Lower your XP by giving it to others as quest rewards for ones you assign?
---
It's a great year to join Warframe. Check the last Devstream on YouTube, a lot of great content is coming. 
---
Don‚Äôt play. If you need public opinion to make a decision, then I say don‚Äôt.
---
speaking of which, anyone got a spare marsupial serum? got caps
---
Max I can craft which is lvl 45, non legendary, just few mods
---
Yes üòî best Fallout imo 
---
Yeah, I still get the infinite loading screen when fast traveling on xbox while owning workshops.
---
I'm fine with balance changes, but they need to be open about them. It seems this may be a stealth nerf, as they have not mentioned it in the patch notes, or the inside the vault article. 
---
I amconfused. So does TS shoot one hit that does 125 or two shots that do 62 each?
---
Ah, ok. That math checks out.
---
I wonder why they do the math ahead of time and create a second table of values, instead of just multiplying the base values by 1.25 if strange in numbers is true.
---
It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ BAAAACK! 
---
I‚Äôve skied Snowshoe Mountain Resort a few years back and had a great time, thumbs up, although there were no Super Mutants messing up the trails at that time.
---
45 is the MAX level for Lever Action Rifles...

If it helps,

I regret you‚Äôre on Fallout 76 sub, and encouraging others to play Skyrim. Lolz
---
Hit ctrl alt del and instead of choosing task manager choose "switch profile" and then log back into your profile. That causes the OS to clean up open programs.
---
I haven't had the issue with it locking up and taking over the screen on exit since a few patches ago, but that's what I was doing. 
---
I did notice though that when I quit now, no matter the option I choose, it seems like my character stays in the world for a time afterward because I quit while stuck in a wall inside AMS HQ and I was irradiated to hell when I logged back on. Last night I did the well tuned and then quit and when I logged back in today it was down about 10 minutes from a full timer. So that's annoying, but you can alleviate the worst of it by making sure you log out in a safe spot or in power armor.
---
I haven't looked to see if the client is still open in task manager afterward but I guess I should check that and see if it is and if ending the task would fix the issue.
---
The BoShas a long history of dramatic air travel. After the defeat of The Master, a small fleet of airships was deployed to travel east in search of the remaining super mutants. They made it as far as Chicago before crash landing, and the survivors formed the midwest chapter of the brotherhood of steel. 
---
That's a really cool idea! I bet it'd take a lot of work though and we might get an MMO-style auction house first.
---
As far as I know it doesn't effect event rewards.  But I could be wrong there.
---
Some things I can confirm though:
---
Intelligence raises the durability bar of crafted items.  Doesn't "seem" to help when adding mods to things.
---
Luck increases the durability of "found" items (not sure if that applies to event rewards, maybe just enemy drops).  Luck also increases the NUMBER of plans you get from doing treasure runs.  We tested a 5 luck, 8 luck, and 11 luck party when doing about 150 treasure maps each.  The 11 luck got the most plans, 8 luck got middle, and 5 luck got the least.  We did not test the "quality or rarity" of the plans though (aka the 5 luck could've gotten more rare plans.......we didn't test that).
---
That is really going to hurt if you're using them with a VATS build...
---
I believe I have seen lvl 50 legendaries
---
They benefits you the style. 
---
When you are down at least you are down with style. 
---
So technically, the glitch is not fixed, it is just less likely to happen? 
---
They just need to make load in times longer then. 
---
I'd rather wait longer to login,  than have to relog 50% of the time, because I didn't wait long enough for the pipboy glitch to pass. 
---
Reading is hard
---
No, no you haven't.
---
As a WV native, I love seeing so many people finding new interest in the natural beauty of our state. I think our economy suffers because we don't have giant tourism traps like Disney World and our climate isn't exactly vacation-y, but I love living here.
---
The hiking is awesome, there are lots of local artists, and the folklore behind our cryptids always had me terrified in the best ways as a kid.
---
Definitely go see the mothman museum if you make a trip, and the state capital is beautiful in the heart of Charleston. 
---
learning mods by scrapping is broken on several pieces of armor. I've crafted and scrapped a hundred trapper legs. i have nearly all the heavy trapper mods unlocked, but have only unlocked two for sturdy.
---
&gt; you attack them because you can't handle someone disagreeing with you. 
---
&gt; No, it's a post attacking people like you 
---
The irony and projection is strong here
---
it's still a post defending Bethesda, whether you want to admit it to yourself or not. Attacking people who don't agree with what Bethesda did/is doing is defending Bethesda, I don't see how you could see it any other way. Also not quite what you're going on about with entitlement. Wanting this game to not be riddled with bugs isn't entitlement, I don't see how it could possibly be perceived as that, your little definition doesn't even apply here nor does it make sense in the context of what is going on
---
have you tried just waiting it out? always works for me.
---
I‚Äôm honestly already so annoyed at how often Mothman spawns with this event. All but one of mine (who spawned at my camp as soon as I logged on) have disappeared as soon as I do a couple hits of damage. They‚Äôre just inconvenient at this point. 
---
So if you use a PA paint your PA should weigh zero?
---
In combot, healing factor won't work, plus thr caution bug that sticks prevents healing factor.
---
In other words, you will die by starving first before you could shoot, let alone the fact that hunger and thirst reduce AP limit.
---
Yeah, it slips my mind constantly if I'm being honest. My numbers could be off as I'm not looking at it right now but max Adrenaline and max Nerd Rage *should* be like an 80% damage increase or something. When I get back on in like 30 min I'll screen shot my current card list because at this point, you got me questioning what I'm actually running. 
---
You got screenshots?
---
I know they use a lot of 3rd parties to expand capacity as a project gets closer to completion, but according to LinkedIn Bethesda has a lot of their own QA staff.
---
What about phillipi? I‚Äôm disappointed they made up some fake ass war museum (the actual one has a couple preserved mummies in it) and the historical covered bridge. Oh well, at least they mentioned it was the site of the first land battle in the civil war talking statue excluded. 
---
You know I just noticed they‚Äôve never had an exploitable mall in fallout to my knowledge.
---
Apparently mutation does work but character has to be thirsty and hungry 
---
Hrm, yes, I think that would be an effective means of testing it. I'll see if I can't run some tests with my friends later.
---
Question: Yesterday afternoon, Installed patch [PS4], Jumped right on a server, no problems. After dinner, went back into game, logged in. I could not get back to my C.A.M.P. I tried 11 times to connect to my camp. I even went to my camp location to see if any other dwellers at location, nada. Whats up? weather of recent?
---
Everyone losing their minds over the Adrenal Reaction thing and here I am wondering what all these references to "Babylon" are.
---
yes, but how do I post them here? This subreddit doesn't allow it. 
---
two shots are pretty meh..ive even seen regular two shots at vendors..tbh..i dont really care if never get a TSE from a drop
---
Maybe not, I could swear I saw something on sale on Fo76market anyways ive got standard lvl 45 and on vats build, stealth i deal very decent damage.
---
The dried up lake feels very desert like when you're in it, but it's not very big though.
---
Imgur?
---
it aint hard to test it urself as well. Just starve lol and ur set.
---
Thank you my friend
---
&gt;the only TSE I ever got on my own was a Western Revolver
---
where
---
But those material are such a pain in the ass to get lol 
---
i prefer anti armor because accuracy. 
---
Cannot get on now but my friend said no it didn‚Äôt change. 
---
Yeah that's why I noted that at the bottom.
---
when I get home, i will sort that out
---
if you need lead / materials i would suggest the amc building if you can clear it its kind of hard though but theirs lots of junk
---
I noticed this the other day when there were two guys having a shootout in the watoga train station and the serendipity indicator kept popping up on my screen even though I was several buildings away and not being shot at. It didn't pop up while I was being shot at by the robots though, so I think it was just showing me his indicator and not giving me the perk. I think it might be an indicator/visual cue issue because I get the highlighted living targets from other players hud mods but not the tagging feature.
---
I agree, gun wear seems faster. Probably another stealth nerf.
---
Only if it's more expensive every time they re-release it. 
---
Yep. Also the Nuka Quantum that's usually to the left of the golf club right in that patch of plants.
---
If I have glitched it, the game is screwed unless I relog. Even if i fast travel (as weirdly, the map still works during the glitch). 
---
Good point. Your so cool!!
---
I looked a while back, and they have off season rates and packages for $200-250/night. It's not cheap, but given that a typical hotel in a big city will cost at least that much I don't think it's outrageous.
---
Neat. Ordered a paper tourism guide for shits. 
---
Tell him to completely deplete it until he sees the starving on his stats. Then it procs from there.
---
I was curious as well. Alas, nothing special. They item mod collections (data struct) and similar exist in the base game. :( Still uncertain why they gave the the "babylon" suffix.
---
Totally. As a former 20 year resident of WV, Fayetteville is where it's at.  
---
Yeah, multiplication is for nerds!
---
Well I am good then. My character needs food and water hourly. They are akways hungry/thirsty. 
---
What a weird glitch. 
---
I will keep an eye out. I seem to bump into grahm pretty frequently.
---
ADS has no spread, except the weapons I listed.
---
For future reference, is there a good place to look for such tips?  The answer given was very specific to my problem, so I'm curious if there is a good source for this other than posting about it.  If you don't wish to share sources, I totally get it. ;)
---
&gt; The first was a fallen Satellite that had a lot of nice high end technological junk in it to scrap
---
Nope, see this quite a bit trying to farm the civil war reenactor
---
The other one I haven't seen though.
---
Thank you!!
---
Is it for sale?
---
I had the same problem but I was level 40 and soloing a silo and almost done too and went to repair my all rise(only good item I had at the time) and sever disconnected 
---
I read that report and I'm checking the code to see if I missed something, but I wasn't able to find a correlation yet. More digging ia in order
---
Is adrenal reaction broke? 
---
Ash heap is pretty wasteland-y feeling also.
---
I believe it was in Whitesprings
---
yeah thats not bad at all..id pay that
---
No some people here will argue against and belittle any criticism whatsoever, as if everything is perfect. Anything even remotely negative got downvoted into oblivion. Anyone who said anything negative got bullied away. So yeah I fucking blame those shill fanboi assholes for the state of the game and every game that releases like this, because they allow it and enable it.
---
U wot mate?
---
I wish I could use this excuse at my job. ‚ÄúHey Boss, I know my work has been far below standards these past few months, but I‚Äôm working on it!‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúWell, you have been trying really hard so kudos to you champ!‚Äù
---
Ok I see that, but is it better than instigating?
---
I needed this! Awesome ü§£
---
Only useful comment in this whole thread lol. Where do you get the taffy recipe?
---
Keep us updated! We need more posts like these.
---
Same, xbox as well. Froze up as soon as I loaded the pipboy. Back to waiting and being attacked until it renders properly
---
thx
---
Gamertags being displayed is a Microsoft legal requirement, it won't ever change.
---
You're unfortunately better off picking a build, and then building your RP around it. There are enough costumes you can pretty much be whoever you want.
---
Yip, learning the Radium Rifle was my biggest quest. I'm not really sure what else there is to do now other than searching for 3* mobs or spunking 1k ammo at the Queen.
---
I thought queen loot was due to get "better" after the patch but it hasn't. I have no idea why they thought ultracite PA mods were in any way worthy as rewards for beating the biggest (only?) boss in the game. Same with prime receivers, there's no way the cost of ultracite ammo balances the extra damage when you consider the cost to launch a nuke and farm the mats.
---
I love this game, but Bethesda are doing a bloody good job of making it hard, us ps4 bros list our biggest player Billions yesterday, after 400 levels he's tapped out. My IRL friends quit ages ago as they got bored and the random friends I had are slowly disappearing due to boredom, new games and of course the bans.
---

Ah the old doesn‚Äôt have a point so deflects to a meaningless comment
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied grog axe player and I only do maybe 1000 at 1 hp. I don‚Äôt know how people get damage to 3000 or what ever
---
i noticed the same happening last night to me as well.  
---
I agree the clothing could weigh a bit less than it does now. They've made all these unique and craftable outfits with no benefit at all (except a couple) if it's purely cosmetic it would be nice to weigh 0.01 instead of 0.1
---
 I got the Dense mod from R&amp;G Station quite a while ago. The actual BOS plans I pulled from the car south of Watoga Station.
---
 All this has changed, so I dunno what's current as I quit farming after over 100 levels on 2 chars. Quit and now I walk everywhere. Try it if you too have farmed too much. ;)
---
Found mine by server hoping at Watoga.  Didn‚Äôt take long. 
---
Yeah they like to pretend that they don't hear us. Also, not only do they have to lower the event cooldown timer, but they also have to make them active more often. They have a chance of activating randomly if you visit a certain area which is kind of silly
---
Only lead and aluminum weights slightly less, some weight more while bulked
---
I had them drop using a treasure map in the Cranberry bog, so they are still in the game, just not at the vendor 
---
As soon as you get the Royal Jelly it becomes available. It's a food item that restores 120 AP and doesn't expire either. It just requires 1 Royal Jelly and 1 Wood.
---
another person not willing to read and just post a reply to bash because you are too immature to manage your own emotions it seems. 
---
That statement is itself a negative and so even if it were true it couldn‚Äôt be proven. It isn‚Äôt true though. You can‚Äôt prove that something doesn‚Äôt exist but there are other sorts of negatives that can be proven. 
---
There is a better mod anyway. I got a heavy heated shock mod for my sledge. It can't be learned I don't think but you can find it.
---
It's the base damage, which is always 125% with TS. You use the number in the pipboy.
---
This makes me think about Seed Vaults. That is some safe data if the world ends. I‚Äôd like to think it‚Äôs filled with precious data but it‚Äôs probably just Facebook posts and porn or something. 
---
(Cool name!)
---
Just checked, you're right.
---
They used to constantly end up on top of the main house in sanctuary hills for some reason. Definitely something weird going on with the code there
---
It doesn't help for low levels. By the time you are max level or even higher than that, you are rolling in caps and laugh at the travel cost because 25k is the cap limit. But when you are level 15 or level 20 and it cost you 67 caps to travel to an event, that's pretty lame. I have to give up 80% of the Caps I have as a low-level and not be able to afford anything
---
I don't even use my TS gatling laser because of this. 
---
How is that remotely the same thing? Lol 
---
Well it don't have to be vendors. I found the legs last week near my house at us-13c bivouac

Did you mean - your write :)
---
definitely not a display bug, my Bloodied Ripper is doing almost 100 fewer damage.
---
Yes, I did test it.
---
Why would you test this, take screenshots, leave your home and then post this? I don't want to call bullshit here, but this sub has a history of people coming in, making a claim and then act all dodgy when asked for a screenshot. 
---
I stopped placing down elaborate C.A.M.P.s, as spawning enemies are glitching into the fusion reactor room and destroying it from the inside, through closed doors.
---
Only using a 2x2 wooden base with a large tent and all stations inside.
---
this is extremely rare..they have them on the market subs
---
Damn that‚Äôs annoying my whole build is based on it
---
They made a change in patch 5, and it borked the outfit. Now several chest armors will clip through, and your armor will appear over.
---
Kind of upset that it worked fine before,and they still  haven't fixed it, even after making changes to it in this patch.
---
I mean, only the cobalt really. But still, **if** you have the materials I‚Äôd be cheaper than buying the mods. Plus you wouldn‚Äôt have to server hop. 
---
I've only ever seen tempered and hardened hardened being the better.  So buttressed is better than hardened?  Wishing i could mod all my weightless armor to deep pocketed and highest defense.  Three pieces  weightless Marine deep pocketed hardened and still hunting. 
---
Could easily do the ESO route... make the character name prominent, and the tag below, but smaller. Allow the player the choice to choose which they wish to prioritize.
---
Agree, the clue is in the name really... just ‚Äúunderarmour‚Äùis often used as the term for the upgradable types more specifically, BoS, Operative, Vault Suit etc. but you‚Äôre right..!
---
PSA - there's a reference to BlackRider PA paint in the latest patch ESMs that was data mined - perhaps there's another black PA paint coming.
---
I saw an article about it. I wanted to write the author and inform them of their ignorance. There was no option or email to respond to though.
---
do u have gunsmith perks?
---
I read your post. I just disagree with your sentiment that because they are ‚Äútrying,‚Äù which I don‚Äôt agree with, that they should get a pass. This is not a early access title sold for $19.99 on steam. 
---
Just because I don‚Äôt agree with you does not mean I didn‚Äôt read your whole post or I am emotionally unstable. 
---
I think events in the forest have a chance.
---
Dead brahmin arent new either. It's when you find them 8n a circle that it's really creepy. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they know how everything works together. They are just moving the pea around hoping the code fixes itself. 
---
What an excellent idea! As others mentioned this would probably get way out of control if given the full freedom, but I can see this being a very engaging tool if applied as something similar to messaging system from Dark Souls series, i.e. a simple sentence creator with an ability to indicate objects, actions etc.
---
Yeah, that's not even accurate.
---
He basically spawns somewhere, and walks along every friggin road on the map.
---
Give it a couple days before the nuka cola shithead from his now deleted thread from earlier is in the media because he's "gonna sue bethesda"
---
Yeah first rule about good things is, we don't talk about good things.  It will be patched.
---
It still works. You need to reapply it though.
---
Wym 
---
Right, why don‚Äôt they test it before releasing the patch? Such amateurs!
---
Yeah this what I was referring to.
---
Vanilla vs vanilla the gameplay is similar but 76 is faster paced combat because of realtime vats and pipboy. Everything else is way more fleshed out in 4. Settlement building is lightyears ahead of CAMP building, and the quests in fallout 4 feel more numerous.
---
Modded Fallout 4 is... no comparison. It's anything you want it to be. They have fixed every bug and you can add in every feature you ever thought was missing. The graphics are as good as your system can handle, with everything up to 8K textures and now they even have entire new actor skeletons that move like the best new games (no weird knees or abdomen when they bend).
---
Where was it revealed he was a cheater?
---
" try comparing a 3\* max modded, max perk weapon to one that has none of that. Yeah, you'll see that these things actually *do* matter in PvE."
---
im saying that the damage difference is irrelevant if u are killing mobs in one hit with non legendary vats headshots.
---
I can confirm that two shot is only using the weapon's base damage and not any additional damage from mods.
---
And Bethesda would of course look like the bad guys as always
---
This sub won't let me make this a separate post for whatever reason but also if you get a picklock card in a perk pack before you reach a level high enough to use it, that card won't be added to your deck. 
---
Interesting, I got lucky last night, I was at Sons of Dane or the Ammo Depot and he walked right past me down that road, I notice it is not on his route as per this map ..

Get a lawyer.! And get all lawyered up.

That‚Äôll teach ZeniMax/Bethesda for denying you your god given right to break an ELA or TOS

Yeah, that could still be a thing.  I haven't tested it since the update came out.
---
Yeeeahhh this is kind of game breaking...really wish there was a fix.
---
Just a heads up from a West Virginian
---
Irl it‚Äôs called the Greenbrier, not Whitesprings resort, and is located in White SULFUR springs
---
Yeah, I'd like an option like that. 
---
But, given the pace of past patches and updates, I don't expect it to ever happen.
---
Your questions have common sense answers.
---
Over-encumbrance is permitted because it's an established quality-of-life allowance in Fallout since Tactics; because resource gathering is key in the franchise; exceeding carrying capacity is a regular occurrence for most players, between looting and scrapping/crafting/stashing.  And in 76, during combat we may switch perks around that dramatically change our carried weight and capacity.
---
Additional characters let us experience the game in different ways, as different characters with different strengths and weaknesses. Player freedom of choice and every playthrough being different is an established feature in Fallout.
---
But in Fallout New Vegas, do you remember being able to play for hundreds of hours, then start a new game and give your new character all your established character's stuff? Of course not.
---
Despite the cries of armchair game devs in this sub, Bethesda had made it clear that large inventories impact performance. And I think the establishment of a hard +1500 carry cap obviously targets mules, not regular players; running around with a &gt;1500 over-encumbrance never was fun, hence miles. In other words, BGS has actively targeted mules for nerfs.
---
All this to red-state that mules circumvent inventory restrictions clearly intended to be in the game. Otherwise there's be a "trade with other character" menu, which would be easy to implement. Again, makes it clear this behavior is not intended.
---
Not new, but unfixed. Pipboy still locks up if you open it when you load into the game. 
---
&gt; Just because they say something is coming at an unknown date doesnt dismiss the complaints about it taking so fucking long 
---
The problem here is that people on this side of the equation always want NOW. And if not now, a promise of exactly when. Which they can't give. People are just don't know what it takes to do any of this, no matter what they claim about themselves and what they know. 
---
&gt; It's like if you waited an hour for your food at a restaurant, and someone says "dont complain, the waitress said it is still coming" 
---
That's a bad analogy. Because the speed of service is part of eating at a restaurant. There's never been any such offer put forward from Bethesda. It just is always in their benefit to do be as speedy as possible. And again, they are trying. I'm not saying they are always successful. Certainly that they have to fix so much is their doing. But they have accepted that, and are working to get fixes out about every two weeks. If you can't accept that, that's you.   
---
&gt; Over 3 months for a roadmap is a total disaster for a live service game where people are supposed to be playing new content perpetually 
---
Actually it's not for what they are doing. And they were always upfront about this being something new, because they want to grow the game based on the players feedback. So first they have to let people play the game. And three months isn't that long of a time for such a thing.
---
Second. That is a sentiment others have said, based on other games doing so. Which is just a PR stunt on those game companies part. They have most of that content ready to go, they just hold it back so they have breathing room, and look like they are making up new stuff to give you. I mean if you can't see that's exactly what that is, then again, you. 
---
I think it should go even further: 
---
* chems (stimpacks, buffout etc.)
---
* food
---
* water
---
* Aid (this could be bobbleheads, magazines, and other misc like blood bags etc). 
---
Reapply? How do I reapply a mutation? 
---
Does it? I swear I've seen two bullet holes when I aim down sights with my TS gatling gun, and the second bullet does miss sometimes. I'll have to check when I get home.
---
This is a really important note then, and actually devalues Two Shot significantly even further. I'll add this to the OP.
---
Me too!
---
Killed a scorchbeast, 2 grafton, 2 death claws and nada
---
It‚Äôs crazy in a nuke with serendipity firing off repeatedly even though it isn‚Äôt loaded in the card stack. I wonder if my lucky break is firing off for everyone around me when it does for me. Free gun repair, just stand nearby. 
---
All I'm going on is things I've read here in other threads, so you may well be right.  But, catch up on the posts here, there could be other circumstances that are causing that.
---
(I don't have any mutations, don't have a melee build...hell, I'm not sure if I've ever swung my melee weapon.  I'm *certainly* not the expert :P )
---
I‚Äôll bite, How does the quest for the T45 align w/your post about excavator?
---
Better at being lame.
---
Complete an event is broken too. Did two daily's and nothing. Going to try some others later today
---
You can either try your luck at farming it again or you can get your hands on the serum. If you don't have the plans for it players sell serums for cheap, 200-300 caps usually.
---
Bumped into him in the mire near the radio station and and was really disappointed in the stuff he had in stock.. The robot in Grafton town is way better.
---
Stop cheating and you won't get banned, lol.
---
ive had it happen once or twice, i kill all the targeted ones and quest doesnt finish. started looking for other mobs, and i have been noticing one or two dont have a kill marker on them until they actually appear on my screen / line of sight then a marker will pop up over them and a pip on the compass.. some have been a good distance from the group.   
---
if it happens again try circling the area, checking ditches, buildings and so on. 
---
one i couldnt complete once because the scorched had appeared inside of a wall in the glassed caverns, i zoned out then right back in and the mob reloaded in the very back of the cavern. he didnt have a targeting pip over him but i was following sound it made as it was the only thing i had left alive in the cavern. when i made it to the back of the cavern the pip appeared above him and in my compass and finished the quest when i killed it.
---
It absolutely is. I don‚Äôt use it but I‚Äôve had it proc in nuke zones quite a few times. 
---
Hey by any chance, do you have a link for that Bazzar sub?
---
/u/Heartwork420 You got anything for us? :)
---
On Xbox? I should be able to do all mods on Marine Armor. 
---
I never said they get a pass. And that's not even what this post was about.
---
it's about keeping yourself informed so you have an idea of what's going on with the game, and what they are doing and planning.
---
So maybe you do need a little work on reading comprehension and shouldn't be so defensive. 
---
Yeah, that particular section seems to have an image of a Scorchbeast. 
---
Very cool otherwise. I recall someone posting that Grafton also has some near-perfect replication of buildings, and was hoping to see some shots of that too. 
---
Maybe crashed nuclear powered air and spacecraft take a long time to clean up. I can't recall any lore off hand, but is it possible they crashed before the war and became tourist locations while the cleanup was underway?
---
Especially after seeing how many nukes we are launching at our own state   WTF is going on down there, guys?!
---
Why do they f*ck up all the time with their patches. It seems the dev team are amateurs! 
---
They want your flux. 
---
Aliens! They love brahmins.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I was there. I almost fell in because I could see the loot as she was sliding in but couldn‚Äôt hit X fast enough! I didn‚Äôt fall in but a few people died trying to get that loot.
---
I think you incorrectly spelled dupers :P  
---
The chest, legs and arms are now random plan spawns in the Toxic Valley. I would plot out a plan route and server hop until you get them and yes this is for the BOS Combat armor.  
---
Happy Hunting.  
---
Yeah, some uninformed "journalist", writes a biased article on a tech news site, and then people will be citing this bs as "proof" it was mean ol' Bethesda picking on "honest" players.
---
*sigh* I had to use *way* too many quotations in that.
---
Yeah, the guy promoting two shot is actively looking for bloodied explosive guns in the trading forums so I'd suggest he has an ulterior motive to posting... 
---
Global chat might be ok as long as it's not forced. I have no desire to hear the lil 150 guy on the other side of the map talking shit in between his dorito crunching. 
---
I have a fab ryzen 2700x system with a 1080Ti it can handle anything tell me more about this modding business please :D
---
Aim your explanation at the level of a thick four year old, not joking either ;)
---
Yeah man I'm on xbox,  that would be sweet. At work right now I'll probably be on tonight Pacific time. I got plenty of caps and materials. 
---
For me I got a 1 Star grognak axe lvl 30, I think it was troubleshooter or exterminator. 
---
Thing was, the event hadn't finished yet. And i froze immediately after death. Had to reload and didn't get my loot off of SBQ oe the XP for the event. That scenario would have made sense. If the event had ended but it hadn't.
---
I guineinly think its because of how customer service is with most companies, often they get the last word because they can just ignore you if they dont want to deal with it and know full well that when a post like this comes up their fanbase will defend the company's interests for them.
---
Bethesda has made some games that I absolutely love, but at every opportunity they prove that they are not a moral company and do not deserve to be protected from backlash. But everything they do no matter how anti consumer it is, gets followed by children defending them in mass because they make fun games.
---
And that is the case for most mobile game users the business model is about getting the most money out of the users that are lose with their wallets you know you won't sell much so you back up the price on the ones that will buy in regardless. Then going further games get designed around manipulating those users. The atomic shop having flash sales and limited time offers that no one could hope to grind out to meet is a good example of bethesda's efforts to catch themselves some whales but it goes deeper the fact that this game is forced public multiplayer instead of friends based is basically so everyone is a walking billboard to show whales what's on offer. 
---
I could go on but the point is you're a whale not because you've pay'd but because to them you are a prize to catch.

Awe a Grammer baby. Thanks for teaching me something. Too bad speech to text doesn't know that.

There is definitely spread in a TS ADS, try it with TSE against a wall and you'll see it spreads less but still spreads. 
---
I'm just yanking your chain..great argument guys! I best look for an AA to keep a foot in both camps.
---
Im not being like that though. I picked up a loot bag filled with bulk junk. Now im banned and can't even communicate with Bethesda. What frustrates me the most is i pick it up weeks ago, was suspicious, and submitted a ticket asking if it was allowed to have the items i found. If it was that big of a deal, why would they have not gotten back to me weeks ago. Instead they ignored me and just banned me instead. I just want someone to message me back instead of telling me im banned and there is nothing I can do.
---
but why?  the ability to breath air doesn't make you immune to airborne toxins, fish can breath in water but aren't immune to waterborne toxins...  why should the ability to breath underwater also make one immune to waterborne toxins?
---
I am not savvy with all that information going on in this post. Can you explain how they nerfed stealth so I can decide if I am going to stop lvling a stealth/sniper build?
---
man....
---
what happens if I charge back through PayPal. Every patch, a new issue or something still messing my game up. The quick 'server unresponsive' issue and the eventual 'disconnected from server' issues piss me off the most though.

Yeah, apparently it scales slower now until around 30% hp... then it picks up.
---
Sounds good. I'm on Eastern time right now, so if by some reason we can't meet tonight, we can make it work soon after. I can also craft you a [BoS Combat Armor Helmet](https://imgur.com/a/IlFhlTk) (pictured with Welding Goggles and Surgical Mask) if you'd like for a cool look. Can also be worn with most of the gas masks :).

Ugh, Spectrum. We had issues with slow speeds during peek times. I worked as a tech at the time for another company. I knew exactly what the problem was, a node, and was even able to ask customers that had Spectrum internet if they had slow speeds at those times and they did.
---
It took countless calls, 3 tech visits, 4 line techs that I watched never leave their vehicle and lie about it later before I filed a complaint with the BBB. Once I did that I got a call from VP of operations from their corporate office who flew down and worked with crews for 3 weeks, still chasing after "noise in the line" and dismissing me saying it was a node because he "checked the node and it was fine" .... turned out he didn't check during peak hours. The night before he decided to give up and fly home he checked the node during peak times only to realize I was right all along.
---
They had replaced every line coming into my neighborhood and ripped up an asphalt parking lot and replaced it all because no one would listen to me or were too incompetent to at a minimum check the right thing at the right time.

I learned recently that Armorer Perk takes away the Ballistic Fiber requirement from crafting marine armor. I share this knowledge with you.

I have seen people griefed at the train station for their flux. That‚Äôs why I leave the server after. You just ran into a jack hole trying to ruin people‚Äôs fun.

I cannot think of any reason to have that much ammo. Not one. I run three different Gauss Rifles and even then I at best keep 2,000 rounds on me and run batteries included level 3 constantly to do it. Even if and I mean if he was able to run all three ranks of every ammo weight perk and multiple pieces of ammo weight reduction gear. There is still no reason to have that much ammo.

Try both, but I prefer Market over Bazzar.  Market has more people, active mods, and a Karma system.  Post your buy or sell thing in both.

Any press is good press, I guess

The nerf has nothing to do with the stealth mechanic. "Stealth Nerf" means, a nerf that isn't announced in the official patch notes.
---
Protective Casual underarmor is on a Levelled List with the name containing Early Warnings but the Early Warnings quest doesn't use this LL, and this is the only LL it appears on so it cannot drop. Without Protective, Shielded Casual won't drop. So both are unavailable in the game. Those that can craft them got their plans from the Dev Room or a trade with someone where they originally came from the Dev Room. See this post for more detail:

From what I've heard large amounts of Ultracite ammo seem to be improperly triggering their "system".
---
I have zero sympathy for the guy. He was a duper, plain and simple.
---
Maybe we don‚Äôt want them to fix it?
---
How did he even kill you guys, you didn't have a workshop before the event by any chance ?
---
These players are probably more rare, but still doesn't make it right .. if you weren't open to pvp mode, he shouldn't of been able to kill you unless he was using some sort of glitch. There have been very confirmations people can kill others with one shot unless they already open to pvp
---
I don‚Äôt doubt they‚Äôre developing new content now, pretty sure that shit should be mostly done before launch. I feel like it‚Äôs pretty normal for games to get some new content after 3 months. That being said, I‚Äôm not surprised they‚Äôre waiting a bit to release the content with the volume of bugs currently present.
---
His primary account ban was for 140k Rounds.  You can legitimately require acquire the 100k rounds needed to get banned.  You can pick up ammo others dropped in the wild and you can purchase ammo from other players.  These are legitimate ways to acquire ammo.  Bethesda could block them from being sold or drop-able like they do with atom shop items (etc) if they didn't want them dropped or sold
---
That's what I thought the general consensus was as well, actually. It seemed fairly obvious.

Is it viable to play like that?

Also more focused on PVP than actual game content.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure if lasers work differently but I had a two shot laser and it could be 1 hit/1 miss while ads, very easy to see.  I would almost bet ballistics work the same and op is mistaken because I have definitely seen damage variation in my hits while ads with a TS handmade.

I like the part were it says ‚ÄúBethesda is looking into it‚Äù... right...lol

&gt; I don‚Äôt think they would allow people to make their own tapes. Free  speech is a thing but it‚Äôs not hard to imagine people going way too far.

Imagine being scared of what people might say for a game rated 18+

The hip thing for the media and youtubers to do is bash bethesda regardless of facts because it gets more clicks at the moment.

Is it a higher jump than off the top of the Garrahan Estates tower?

I meant that they nerfed adrenal reaction stealthily without any patch notes about it. Not nerfing stealth. Sorry if I caused you to misunderstand what I meant.
---
in my experience the rare Event loot clothes are pretty rare on the market too. 
---
That's honestly my gut reaction to this piece, I just didn't want to say that in OP so I could let the article speak for itself.
---
Sneaky mfs nerfed it, didn't they?

Article seems well written and accurate based on what was posted here.

They are nazis but they are kind of soft nazis if you want nazis it's full nazis or no nazis

I just played for the first time in weeks and went to check the Watoga vendors. I heard a booth spawn and went to check if it was legendary only to see the door open and a dead robot fall out. I chuckled to myself then went to find another booth to spawn and it happened again. No wonder there are no robots wandering around when they are DoA - Dead on Arrival. Watoga became safer for those who haven't completed Mayor for a Day.
---
If you have any of the mutations that randomly inflict damage, they have in the past put you into PvP mode unknowingly. In a nuke, it‚Äôs pretty easy to get hit by some other player and fire off the effect. They supposedly fixed it for reactive armor, but not sure for electrically charged, unstable isotope etc. 
---
Definitely psa. For cobalt the best place is momma dulce

I saw a few sites covering this story and it reminded me of this ban that made news on xbox years ago. This kid, may have been autistic but I can't fully remember, but the news covered him being banned on xbox for cheating. The kid swore he didn't and so did his mom. The news made Microsoft out to be the bad guy...turns out, Microsoft did have proof the kid did such thing to earn a ban and he finally admitted it. 
---
Slow news days with zero to little research other than taking that persons word. 
---
Yes, I hear ya. I got it for Christmas. I told my wife and kids to not waste their money to get it for me at full priceit, since it would be at least 50% cheaper in a year. Little did I know it would be 100% cheaper in less than two months.

Fallout has reached the levels of "Free AOL CD," LOL.

50 caps might be your best and only offer,

anyone can get a set for free if they just play a lil questline for it

I believe Luck helps out, I've tested and do notice an increase in the quality and rarity of the gear dropping from 3 stars but this could just be wishful thinking, no hard math put in but before on 3 luck I rarely got a 3 star drop, from a 3 star enemy. Now, I get a noticeable difference with 8 luck.
---
Still happening sucks 
---
It's another story that video game "news" sites can spin to ride on the hating Fallout 76 and Bethesda band wagon. 
---
Gamer journalism has always been a joke.
---
Holy shit. Is this after the patch that changed the vendor items? This is GOLD!
---
/u/Valseek, /u/BethesdaGameStudios_, /u/LoneVaultWanderer, /u/Ladydevann et al. This is a trust issue that a lot of us are struggling with:  
---
1) Ninja nerfs even though we've repeatedly asked for transparency. What are these nerfs conducive to? What is the guiding principal here? Slower progression? Greater resource usage? These are not huge number changes in the grand scheme of the overall damage stack, but they definitely greatly affect players who run around with 60-70% health to conserve ammo.  
---
2) New OBVIOUS (for any developer) bugs identifiable just by looking at the diffs between versions. Your developers clearly made changes to the Adrenal Reaction mutation, why weren't the changes tested before being merged into the release?  
---
This is very frustrating as a player.
---
yes.  and since you are already the leader they make you head of the Appalachia division, I mean they can't just make you leader of the whole Enclave...
---
You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies? ;)

Yeah, that would work too, and possibly be better.

The "Hangry" legendary effect!

You make me head hurt. Me smash you with hammer now.

It's acquiring 100000 of a **single rare** item in a 30 period. You'll be fine. It's basically impossible to do this in normal play, even with Ammosmith and super duper procing.

Crafting 50+ strikes will not get you banned.

Yeah same here can‚Äôt really tell about this one since I honestly don‚Äôt / never used it.

But the wording in the code is what gets me , it was deliberately changed even named for a different resource.

Probably to see how many people will uproar and outweighed user vs balance 
---
Yes. When maxed out, those three are 3rd, 4th, and 5th, following Bloodied and Junkie's for 1st and 2nd.

I personally believe top 3 are Bloodied, TS, then Furious.

It's not a job it's a hobby, I want to make sure Freida Wallbanger gets to roam the wastes free(ish) of bugs and glitches, if they gave the option to run a build on a Test server there are people that would gladly take it, and those that wouldn't. Nothing wrong with that, I never got paid to be the camp cook for boy scouts but that didn't stop me and my dad from waking up at 5 to cook breakfast for almost 60 13 yr olds. It's community my dude
---
Where do you get that general consensus from?  That post was heavily up-voted (12.4K) and it seemed to me that there was way more people feeling sorry for the guy than the opposite.    I don't see how a post gets so up-voted if the majority disagree, if anything they would down-vote the post if they did not agree. 
---
&gt; The guy says that he simply likes the game

Every cheater claims that they are simply innocent
---
I use gunnut 5 all the time so I get a decent amount of time with the TSE before it breaks. I don‚Äôt use vats as my build doesn‚Äôt support it and if I try I get off maybe 3-4 shots before I run out of AP. I aim off the sites and run PA 24/7. On enemies with less DR the TSE does more damage, but when fighting boss level enmities the AA hits harder and kills them faster. Maybe it‚Äôs because of my specific build, but after the nerf I generally use the TSE for large mobs and the AA for SB and Queens. 
---
Luck only affects the CND of items you loot it has no bearing on the quality of loot.
---
Easily achievable by 45 or 50, but I left the nuke until 150 as I needed something to do... :-)

I also ran into this but only once in a few hours of gameplay that included a bunch of server hops. I had other issues however, like the pipboy showing Level 1 for a few seconds.

Thank you for the clarification

woah there is cake, cause this post took it

People get banned from other games for saying racist things.  Am I wrong?

The site is actively maintained and hasn't steered me wrong yet. All credits to them.

Huh, that explains a lot...

This has happened since day 1.
---
But, while your in the battle zone, you are dealing damage.  That would count to threshold.  I launched nukes to arrive there with 6 people.  4 people take one shot and hide in the shed.  The is total BS.  I hate slimy douches. 
---
Out of curiosity, has anyone tested the Blade of Bastet/Eye of Ra 100% AA? I am messing around with using the MoM set on an alt and am just curious if there is any stacking with Incisor or if it truly is 100% and hence caps AA all on its own.

Just out of curiosity did you reapply Adrenal after the patch?

Name twins!! I tried to make it .5pastlightspeed when I originally created this username a million years ago (I think for Xbox Live...) but it wouldn't let me start with a decimal. And 5pastlightspeed is just the incorrect speed haha. Nice workaround, though!

Hopefully not Facebook related.. but porn is probably what we need in a true end of the world kind of scenario!

Wow. Thanks so much for posting that, I hadn't seen it before. That's a ridiculously good resource.

Adrenal Reaction was nerfed but not disclosed in patch notes.  At 70% health damage went from 19% to 0%, at 50% health from 31% to 12%, etc.
---
Damage effects are mulitplicative, armor pierce is additive.
---
Yes, that's true, but that wouldn't be a fair comparison. If you add those same effects to a TS, TS is still better.
---
I was 117 when I finished the main quest.

Actually. I‚Äôll tell you this. I‚Äôm in a BoS discord called the Wolfpack, and a bunch of people have checkpoints along the same road going up through the overseers camp and north from where the road forks. He walks by at least once every time we do anything with an event. If you want to put time into exploring, I‚Äôd say just follow the road. That‚Äôs probably the best way to get him

In some ways it is detrimental to do the quests early. If you plan on playing the game into much higher levels the last thing you want to do is get a good quest reward item at a lower level than 45/50.

Confederate Hat is still bugged and not craftable after you read the plan, whether you read the plan before or after patch 6 (tested both last night). The other hats are fixed and all craftable.

Fact is the Bethesda screws allot of stuff up in the process of fixing anything they touch.  So why would the identification of users to ban be any different?  Are you suggesting that is the one thing they can do 100% right the first time around?  Does not seem likely or reasonable.

It can go up to 50% damage increase

I was just as shocked as you! :D

From what I saw that post did get a lot of upvotes, but the two counter-perspective posts I linked in OP also got a lot of traffic and votes. That, combined with the fact that there were plenty of people refuting 900 Hours Guy in his own thread (who were also receiving downvotes because that's how Reddit works), made me feel like there were a lot of holes in his story.
---
My perspective is that many people *did* support/upvote him at first, but the more they thought about it later the more they realized things were a lil fishy. Kind of like a hangover.
---
Why so defensive? 
---
Pff that‚Äôs crazy, this game sucks!

Devils advocate: The ‚Äùbenefit" is that it has market value. 
---
You could craft tons of outfits and carry them around to sell them to vendors (or players) with no weight penalty.

I mean you could still do that now, just less efficiently.

If I had learned a high value outfit (like the civilwar outfit) thats what I would do :)

 against damage resistance and anti armor works just fine as intended.

but yeah damage reduction . is bugged with anti armor and furios effect and bleeds effect .

I have read a lot more about crashes on PC than on Xbox, and more on Xbox than PS4. I play on PS4 and VERY rarely get kicked or have the game crash.

It's because they were stealth nerfing Adrenal reaction.

I've always had issues with his story, 900 hours is a lot to sink into a game thats been out for just over 90 days. I think that would flag most systems as it would mean you've played this game 10 hours a day practically every day since launch. 
---
I did try finding every single enemy in the area.  Twice at Firebase LT I ran around it, the surrounding areas, went over to the Fissure and spawned a Scorchbeast and lead it back, using the Anti-Air system to defeat it quickly, fast traveled away and came back later, etc.
---
For Bog Town I went thru ever room of the workshop and killed every enemy.  Even claimed the workshop.
---
Thinking about it now, it seems the only time I ever completed the quest was when the quest sent me to an area which had an indoor portion.  One of the Watoga buildings and RobCo.  Every other time it was outdoors and never completed once I cleared every enemy I could find ontop of the marked ones.
---
Damn. That's hard.
---
it really do be like that
---
Middle finger emote please.

its cool. Thanks for the quick response.

I have not crashed ever after January. Maybe I am just too lucky, I *never* crashed in Apex as well while people apparently get 3-4 crashes per hour. But overall, performance is very smooth now.

They talk about "karma" a lot, but they are the ones that have been here farming karma for months. They are the ones that bullied and downvoted away any even remotely negative criticism into oblivion. They are the ones responsible for the toxicity. They will get what they deserve. More rushed buggy games. And those who take a stand against it won't buy another from those companies who keep pushing this crap on us for $60.

Technically doable, but holy fuck why would you
---
Yes, multiply the .36 by 125 TS dmg, and multiply the .43 by 100 AA dmg.
---
You'll see that the TS comes out to 45 dmg.
---
Kinda buggers VATS builds up a little bit, doesn't it? Dependant on AP, which will be reduced because of the mad munchies....
---
Not to mention if you're relying on Dodgy to save you when at 20% health, you'd have significantly less chance to live.
---
Maybe they're gearing up for a new prefix....."Peckish Gamma Gun" - does more damage based on how hungry you are. I might actually play that :P
---
Ah gotcha. Well that's a bug I assume? 
---
Is someone else in the area?  Part of the bug is the HUD highlights were being applied to the mobs even for people not using a HUD.  I've seen highlights with other PA users in the area.  Same for the flavored Mentats (Berry?) which highlights living targets.  I had a purple haze around my character when someone in the area used them.

Your posts are appreciated *Nods once*

Those two are probably pretty close but I don't know for sure. I assume you jumped off the tower without damage?

I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have used such a loaded term. I only meant that there is reason to not allow it, because although everyone should be able to say what they want, there is no doubt some people would go too far.
---
Yes, only the negative effects display for me in my effects menu but my damage is increased, and I feel like I have to be a lower health then before to do the same damage.

Misleading title. Came here for a round of

&gt;*This is for fighting, this is for fun!*

...and was sorely disappointed.

Dude clearly duped and was banned for as much. End of story.
---
Yes, and that math is incorrect. He forgot to multiply that mtiplier by the damage of the weapon you're applying it to.

 It totally does. My TS radium will leave 2 holes in the wall about every other shot while ADS as of the TSE  Nerf

But that would cost "money".

You should see the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers right there at the bridges IRL. Two different colored rivers that do not mix. Very cool!

More like bug injections. Fix 1, introduce 2 more.

Stealth nerfing as in nerfing without telling people.

Exactly.

Let your players know what's being changed. If they care enough to read the damned patch notes, then they probably care about those fine details. 
---
LOL....TRy to do your hording right.. In a hour or two of hoarding like hell i manage to run true my hoarding points and coming out with  2.5k bullets  made each run (i use 5.56)  and each other ammo gets around 200-500....... Its in two max hours.  in a full day of play i made all ammo around 4- 5k... to sell it..I stoped playingt this game but ammo making was my caps machine.  And i played each day for few hours... Before i selled my ammos i had 56k 5 mm ammo and others around 30k... And thats all playing few hours in month.. If i would play like this dude that got banned i could easily reach these nummbers.. Now i  have only so much ammo as i need for me. maxed caps and spended them ,  no more need to hoard.......    Its all bout planing your hoarding and leveling routes....   I hoard and sell from WOW times..

Most likely it was someone who understands just how un- or under-appreciated the Quality Assurance discipline is.

Ok, let's concentrate less on the story and more on the fact of What the actual fuck are they wearing in that image? A Raider Helmet and Left Leg, T-51 Torso and Right Arm, and a T-45 Left Arm and Right Leg. Seriously, what the hell is this.

As long as I can remember, mutations have always been broken in some way. Herd mentality has not worked since day one AFAIK when it comes to sharing cards.

Well, that settles that then.

Four Horsemen themed.  Interesting.

These authors still think nukes in this game are for PVP. Anyone that actually plays 76 can see how ignorant this "journalists" really are.

Thank you!!!!

Yeah.. another thing I noticed is that TS makes your weapon wildly inaccurate compared to non TS. Was ridiculously noticeable on my TS gatling laser.
---
Thank you for answering!
---
 shadow nerf lol 
---
It‚Äôs the material you need for Ultracite ammunition and Decontamination Showers. You get raw in a nuke and have to use a chemical bench to save it or it goes inert. The queen drops stable flux. Violet is probably the hardest to get and you get that from her.

Pacifist off and good riddance to them.
---
It's often been stated that there are two groups of people who got caught up in this. One group who deserved it and another who might have been flagged falsely. After reading all these posts I would argue that there is a third group... one that might have done something to be flagged and simply don't remember. This is because the bans don't count actions from the past thirty days, but apparently ever since the game launched.
---
If you remember the days of the carry weight glitch, it wouldn't be uncommon to find 10k worth of material in a bag after someone dies. Some of these people who actively duplicated probably had so much ammo, stimpacks, etc.. that they freely gave those items out to people for fun. You also had people who traded huge amounts of ammo and NukaCola without questioning it or even realized duplicated was a thing at the time. While the initial stack might not have been 100,000 the items in question, the number of items they found in a container, traded or even given were big enough to give a significant head start towards it. As soon as the item enters your inventory, it is counted even if you drop it immediately.
---
The problem with what causes all the confusion is that this should have been implemented from launch.    
---
Everquest was released 20 years ago so surely there is a wealth of knowledge on what to expect by this point.
---
Speaking of the carry weight glitch, how many people were actually banned for that?  It took several weeks.. maybe a month to fix? Even if fixing it might have been a huge ordeal, where was the algorithm for that? Having persisting issues like that go uncheck creates a Wild West atmosphere where even if something may be implied as wrong, the fact so many people are doing it makes it appear as normal. People perceiving this as normal most likely have no qualms with affecting people directly and indirectly. 
---
Having played other games of this genre (DayZ, 7 Days, Rust, Ark..) rules were often dictated by the server you joined, but they are very clear and followed up with action. If someone did something wrong, it would come off as jarring to everyone else on the server. Servers have admins who make themselves known, actively play and investigate issues as they happen.  When somebody gets banned or even warned, everybody knows about it and why.    
---
Speaking of bans, their system other than "refer to TOS" is a little confusing. At first people got banned and had to write essays. Then some people got permanently banned. Now some people are getting temporarily banned for some of the same reasons the former did. 
---
It's possible Bethesda acknowledges it was their fault they let it persist for so long. That's good. Although part of me wonders if this is also plays into a marketing strategy. Active player numbers dwindle for most games and only a sale or new content spikes an increase in users whether they are new or returning. The addition of new content can make a game grow significantly ( [https://steamcharts.com/app/251570](https://steamcharts.com/app/251570), [https://steamcharts.com/app/381210](https://steamcharts.com/app/381210) ) or just become a flash in the pan ( [https://steamcharts.com/app/438740](https://steamcharts.com/app/438740) ).  Word on the street is that you can already get this game on the cheap. There have been Saturday nights where only me and two other people occupied a server. So when they get around to unbanning people, it could be used as a means to promote new content that is significant. 
---
I have only got it twice since the patch (but only played a couple of times since patch), so my experience may be an outlier. 
---
Still, I think the patch notes did say it was patched. But maybe not in all instances, I guess. 
---
That idiot is just blowing smokes out of his ass.  
---
Well that explains what happened to me last night.
---
Doing the math, that means the person played this game over 9 hours a day since launch.
---
Probably for the best they get banned.
---
Yeah maybe that is the case (that people had a change of heart) I personally did not get that feeling after reading through the mass of responses.   I do get the feeling that the moment anyone mentions the possibility of cheating it whips a certain type of personality into a frenzy here.  I am trying to be as logical about this, Bethesda with this game has a history already of many mistakes in the process of making things "better".  I don't see why this situation would be any different.  The odds that they would properly identify and remove correctly all "cheaters" seems VERY low.  So I would have to error on the side of caution and give those complaining that they have been banned unfairly, the benefit of doubt at this point.
---
There's a bug with the stealth legendary armor effect. I don't know what it takes to replicate but I've been able to exit the crouch stance and move/run with the stealth field active. Not sure if others see me as invisible in their view.
---
Most guns break before 3000 rounds are fired anyway. Of my three main guns I keep about 2.5k rounds for each. Anything else is a waste of valuable space.
---
They could do something along the lines of the player-generated bathroom wall graffiti in the old Trade Wars BBS door game. 
---
Ah so that's what they were going for!
---
He needs a Deconn Shower like a week ago
---
Assuming two shot‚Äôs extra projectile can also trigger on-hit effects, sounds like I‚Äôll only really care about it for those effects. Otherwise, the stability and better accuracy of not using Two Shot makes AA the best choice for me.
---
Amazing post, I love it. Thank you for doing the math.
---
I haven't gotten  to Phillipi yet unfortunately. I'm playing solo and am fairly bad lol. I got to the Lunatic Asylum but had to turn around. Broke my heart, because I wanted to see how similar it was to the actual Asylum. 
---
I play on PS4 and at the time I got the occaisional crash, but the bigger problem was A) teaming up into a party in the first place, and then B) Staying in a party. it would break us up at random when one of us went through a door, or fast traveled to a different location.
---
Yeah I have heard the term before.
---
This is what I've been waiting for from the Atoms shop.  More of this please.
---
Do you have any proof that he cheated to get the ammo? Shamethesda doesn't need proof to ban, but you need proof to not slander the guy. Seriously, if I didn't constantly drop ammo, I would have been banned for having over 100k of multiple types of ammo. That is not a good litmus test to determine the legitimacy of players.
---
Ok, so first off, this isn‚Äôt a survival game.
---
Secondly, This is fucking fallout, the franchise where 75% of the game is about grabbing everything you can find and carrying it around until you can stash it or make shit with it.
---
people who want a survival game have many other options.  This isn‚Äôt it.
---
What happens with soups that satisfies both hunger and thirst?
---
Someone on your team didn't have pacifist on, I'd wager
---
That is exactly my question. We owned no workshops, had engaged in no PvP, and had pacifist on. The only mutations I have are marsupial and speed demon. My husband has none. Are people still stacking bobble heads?
---
Why do you say thanks then ban him from playing the game he has poured so much time into? Bethesda you are really falling from grace. Rapidly. 
---
Ah yes you're right! It keeps micro-adjusting your special stats which can cause shared cards to un-share
---
Oh my....I hate to admit this but I'm willing to drop some money for a few of these.
---
That‚Äôs good to know. Tbh like 95% of the nukes I‚Äôve gone to have all been the queen. The only place I got a lot of cobalt was...Grafton I think? I know it was the northern part of the map, and most of it came from tree sap. But I‚Äôve only seen that place hit once when I was a high enough level to go in by myself and not need anyone to hold my hand. 
---
You can craft the Confederate Hat? After patch 6 I can craft all but that (Civil War Era Tophat, Witch Hat, Skull Hat, and Union Hat). I read the plan before patch 6. Any my teammate just got and read the plan last night and cannot craft it either. Can you clarify which hat you are talking about?
---
Yup, it‚Äôs easy to activate. While the chameleon mutation is active, if you crouch down, unequip your weapon, and put on some armor, you‚Äôll stay invisible. And once it‚Äôs active, there‚Äôs only one way to undo it (besides just turning the game off and back on). You have to trigger the mutation again by unequipping the armor and getting a weapon out. I‚Äôve tested the shit out of it to narrow it down to that perk and that mutation, but not sure if Bethesda even know this causes issues. 
---
Is that a thing? My pacifist can be rendered inert if a teammate doesn't have it on?
---
Woah. I wonder how long these have been in the works, since they didn't appear in any previous datamines. 
---
These are great. Almost makes me want to get a T45.
---
War Rider = War
---
Pale Rider = Famine
---
Plague Rider = Pestilence
---
Black Rider = Death
---
Though "Pale Rider" is commonly used to refer to Death, I think it fits as Famine in this mock up of "War, Famine, Pestilence, Death".
---
It's true Bethesda had made a lot of missteps with this game.
---
It's also true that most cheaters, when banned, will claim innocence. In this or any game.
---
Those two facts together really muddy the waters on this issue, because you are right that we have to be more critical in our examination of Bethesda (they earned it). Which means any person banned that claims innocence has to be given more consideration than they would receive in a different game.
---
Well, I supposed Bethesda dug their own grave with this one.
---
Same here! Literally.... Lucky hole and Hemlock all day. 
---
Happened to me last night
---
YES
---
There are so many hidden mechanics this game fails to explain or highlight, I really suspect that stealth isn't actually broken. Ex: I run ultralight armor (which I thought from F4 gave a bonus to stealth) and if I am crouched and out of power armor, I can walk through a field of high level monsters without being noticed, snipe one and move to another location to avoid detection, and keep myself in caution or hidden without consequence. 
---
There are times when it seems like sneak is broken but only if I do something like fire off multiple rounds into a crowd from close distance. I would not be surprised if the enemy has sight/sound aggro indicators and can literally see the muzzle flash. The more I try to think like a sniper (one shot, keep moving, stay in heavy cover and far away) the more it seems like stealth is working for me.
---
The only caveat to this is that I can't tell if escape artist is working or not.  It seems like when I crouch down while running I go back to caution but I can't tell if that's because of the crouch or because I'm running away. I often try to do it while in a crowd of mobs and in danger, and it never seems to work in that instance, which is when I really need it to.
---
Mole rats and rad scorpions share detection with other enemies often. If they spawn, you‚Äôre detected. If you kill them quickly you can stand up and crouch again to re-gain caution status. Problem is they can sometimes detect you but will aggro to someone else, so dispatching then quickly can be hard
---
This! It seems they tried to stealth nerf adrenal, and the change in code had different ramifications than expected. 
---
Yeah I get that, some people think they have a right to free speech everywhere.  That's just not true, in a virtual world you have no rights and the owners of said world can remove who they choose when they choose for any reason they choose.  We actually pay for the right to enter said world but they can revoke that anytime they want.
---
Eh, it might be annoying but it still gets you much more damage. 
---
Also adrenal reaction doesn't seem to really start boosting damage until about 10% hp now.
---
I have been suffering from the dreaded "Charleston Freeze" forq quite some time now.  You're right that it only started after a patch, because I had no issues during beta or the early days of the game.  
---
When I freeze I can usually wait it out and the game becomes responsive again.  Sometimes it's only a few seconds and sometimes it's several minutes.  It only happens in the general area of Charleston around Poseidon, the train station, and the capitol building.  
---
I have some theories it's tied to the spawning of Grafton Monsters in the area but that's just based on some observations, no hard evidence.
---
I have also Googled the issue previously and have found some people claiming it has to do with running on an 8-core AMD processor - it just so happens I do have a Ryzen 2700.  How about others in this thread?  Anyone else have an 8-core Ryzen or FX processor?  Because this doesn't happen at all to my Intel buddies I play with...
---
General consensus of Bethesda fluffers, he means.
---
Yes, I already replied to your other comment. It's also addressed my post, at the top.
---
Agreed.  I'm getting that.
---
It‚Äôs weird. I tried a Furious plasma rifle and both flamer and sniper barrels don‚Äôt reflect a damage increase when they hit. I can open the pip boy and look immediately after shooting and hitting and nope. Nada. But on a Furious death claw gauntlet, it does show up. I‚Äôve gotten it as high as a 20% damage bonus so far with the gauntlet.
---
&gt; Seriously, if I didn't constantly drop ammo, I would have been banned for having over 100k of multiple types of ammo. That is not a good litmus test to determine the legitimacy of players.
---
That's why they ban people for having aquiring over 100k of a single **RARE** item in a 30 day period and not for having lots of common and completely not rare ammo.
---
Then why does my Adrenal reaction not work at 10% health?
---
If it so fun concept, why is playerbase declining?... 
---
I'll tell you why...Because nukes are bs concept. You spend hour (if you are vanilla) in silo and then when you go into nuke zone  there are chances that you won't see anything valuable in there, because when you are at north side of zone, the legendary monster could be spawned at South side of the zone and by the time you make to south side it will be killed by player who are already there. You have 0 control over what is going on in nuke zone, you can't even communicate with player in there and it is nothing more than freeloading orgy. 
---
Single boss from max difficulty dungeon from WoW is more rewarding, more challenging, more exiting and more working concept than all the nuke zones of F76 put together. 
---
OK that explains a lot. I was thinking it never worked, then sometimes it seemed that if I'd done a TON of fighting it started gradually working. I couldn't figure out why, and it's probably because I wasn't paying attention to my hunger/thirst. I just tested this in-game and I see the same.
---
Unfortunately yes. 
---
Funny, Warframe works just fine with players trading plat for items/whatever, and somehow DE stays in business.
---
I see this as well. 
---
This happens at least once in every session. And it's not firecracker berries.
---
So our "Four Horsemen of the Nuclear Apocalypse" are:
---
* T-45 = War Rider = Horseman of War
---
* T-51 = Pale Rider = Horseman of Famine
---
* T-60 = Black Rider = Horseman of Death
---
* X-01 = Plague Rider = Horseman of Pestilence
---
Although Pale could also be Conquest or Pestilence depending on your source, which would make the "Plague Rider" the Horseman of Famine instead.
---
this is actually pretty amazing lol
---
I see, thanks for your response.
---
Wonder what the corresponding CAMP furniture items will be. I am excited. 
---
'm at 48 and I just got to the Charleston agility quest.  I'll do it one of these days.  I'd rather just roam around and find cool things.
---
Last two I've launched had the server crash 5 minutes in. 
---
Yip, totally, you're in a team dude, check your team mates before going into these things. There's plenty of flux hunters trying to steal your junk after the fight. 
---
It's really shitty of the bandits but if your team mate initiates pvp by not having pacifist on the whole team becomes involved. It's the same problem if a team mate owns a workshop. 
---
Post might be gone but screenshots are forever

---
Pretty much this right here. I‚Äôm not sure Bethesda has my full confidence for me to blindly assent to this. If their detection system is programmed by the same people that made the game,  I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs probably fallible. 
---
Those look expensive. 
---
I multiply by dividing!
---
Yes it is a survival game.  It is very forgiving on the survival aspects for broader appealing.  But GTA is like that as well with auto aim and the now ass load of homing rocket vehicles in game.
---
Just because it has the Fallout name dosen't mean anything.  And in all previous 3D games you had a weight limit that once reached would cause you to inch across the screen.
---
Their CM's might have been out of the loop. 
---
That's not really an excuse to just stealth nerf shit.
---
yes dense and fireproof 
---
So basically, I need to be 90% dead and suffering from starvation.
---
Well that's awesome.
---
Yes, by all means keep using the obvious exploit and keep it to yourself. It's not like BGS is actively looking for people who are obviously exploiting and banning them. Oh, wait...
---
My wife grew up in Philippi and we were visiting the week of fallout‚Äôs release. The museum was hosting a LAN party and you should‚Äôve seen the look of excitement about their small town of 3,380 added in a AAA game then confusion that it was entirely inaccurate  in its depiction 
---
You 100% just read the headline and went straight to comment.
---
I thought it was a 6% increase, up to 36% max, But a Furious Explosive minigun that I sold to a friend recently, seems like it stacks much higher.
---
How did he clearly dupe? I don't see that as fact, we know how ell Bethesda does at "fixing" things, they have shown that time and time again every patch. So odds are not in their favor that they are properly identifying those that they believe duped.  So we have a pattern that has been established by the company that runs this game, and then we have calculations based on both sides some say he could not have created that much ammo, and others that say it is possible.  How is that clear?  If anything it is clear what likely happened.  That Bethesda screwed up yet again..  It's not clear to you, that they keep doing that?  Screwing up..
---
i stopped by from the PC gamer article to ask why people are playing this and why would anyone ever give bethseda money again? how can you squander decades of good will from gamers with such a trash heap of a game and being treated like a criminal from devs?
---
Do hordes of golfers run out and assault passerbys?
---
Nice catch!
---
So I take a workshop for 25caps, for the camp plans. Then waiting a few minutes for the defense for another set of plans for free,  and now at any time another player can come in and force me into pvp. That's wonderful.
---
Yeah but some outfits going on the outside seem to also remove under armor despite supposedly for cosmetic purposes only 
---
Can they mitigate 100% though? There was another thread which I am struggling to find right now which suggested Dens and 2 ranks of Fireproof, but the thread had no two people who agreed on their experience....
---
Alot of people gave up or got bored of the game is my theory. Ive been noticing decline is nukes as time goes on. 
---
Some times the light fades and I need to un-equip and re-equip it to get it to work correctly. Ill check mine tonight and see if I notice the change too.
---
I never suggested it had anything to do with Beths bottom line... It has to do with players that can afford extra atoms exploiting players in game that can't afford to spend real world money on atoms. 
---
Invisible team-members is still a thing as well. Happened to me last night.
---
Otherwise, I'm very happy with the patch.
---
Can you confirm in some way he was duping? As far as I know, all he did was abuse muling and alt accounts. 
---
Pretty sure my Gauss rifles were nerfed. I was doing 240 damage with all the rifleman perks maxed out. Now it's down to 180.
---
I'd love to buy all of them.
---
after they bring blackbird back.
---
whose asscheek do I have to kiss for this to happen?
---
Has anyone else had a wounded Mothman make mechanical sounds, have the head hinge open, and sputter smoke?  
---
Because I didn't get a screenshot fast enough to see inside and I'm danged curious.
---
Exactly. It makes it even more obvious it was a stealth nerf, of their CMs had no idea that any adrenal code was changed whatsoever. 
---
The original comments asked about Rad Worms, ad obviously the code for rad worms was changed in the patch, so the CMs innocently thought Adrenal was accidentally impacted. 
---
Seemingly, unbeknownst to them, a stealth nerf for adrenal changed the code, which bugged it. 
---
I actually feel bad for the CMs on this one. 
---
He tested it, took screenshots, couldn't figure out how to post them, and rediscovered the outside world. Reading comprehension.
---
He didn't duplicate anything. He literally moved the same bunch of munition items from pocket to pockett, Bethesda's shit code counted every action as picking up 595039 rounds from the ground, fresh new. After 3 actions, the system thought that he now has 59485609460769 rounds while still left with the one batch that he is moving around.  
---
Really big fuck up not to take into account where did the picked up items come from.  
---
Lol "sometimes patched"
---
I have an issue with my suit where it makes the lower back look scarred and wrinkled. The spot just below the jetpack part.
---
Have you seen the leaked ones? Save your atoms!!
---
That's a shame. I understand it though, some people are getting up to level 200, there's not much to keep doing. But I definitely enjoyed going into a Nuke zone and all the benefits and dangers that come with it
---
Does it actual carry the benefit of having chameleon or is it just cosmetic?
---
New skins hot af!
---
If Bethesda cannot price they have violated the user agreement (exploit/dupe), then it‚Äôs potentially criminal to deny them access to a product they paid for. I‚Äôm not a lawyer or anything, but that would seem to be logical jump to make here if you deny legitimate players access to a game they paid for because you have strong suspicion they exploited it. 
---
And if Bethesda‚Äôs conduct has said anything since release, it‚Äôs either they are ignorant of the legal implications or flagrantly dismissing them. I think it‚Äôs the former, but still it should be realized and fixed
---
They supposedly fixed stacked bobble heads, but who knows 
---
You guys are all joking right?
---
That what I have. Ryzen 2700.
---
I'm actually really impressed with how the game did the Whitesprings hotel. It looks quite a bit like the real thing!
---
worse. just hordes of actual golfers. 
---
Bloodied is capped at a hypothetical +100% at 0% HP. It's an extra 1% dmg and every 1% HP lost. I tested this myself, as have many others
---
I've never tested Furious myself, but I've heard from numerous people that it's +30%.
---
Nobody knows Junkie's, AFAIK.
---
A $100 bill's.
---
God's work. Thank you.
---
...apparently that is the case for this bug. üòê
---
I welcome the downvotes. This sub is full of crybabies since day 1 so i have no sympathy left. I've struggled through just as many bugs including the PA glitch for 2 weeks. Post the bugs on "their" forums not reddit and move on.
---
Good news is new content coming soon which is much sooner than i expected.
---
It takes more time to wear them down low enough to redo the over repair than it is to just scrap them when their DPS gets too low for where you want to farm so keeping 8 is as easy as hitting the 4 guaranteed spawn locations every couple hours so scrap away after they drop down too low brother.
---
Yes, you can do dual bar and flamer, they are each in different spots on the mod tree.
---
You can get the flamer mod from the vendor west of Big Bend Tunnel West.
---
I've been to the GBO last year before the game drops. The area is completely beautiful and I highly recommend it.
---
But only AT&amp;T seems to have service down there, and if you visit the GBO, bring a old school film camera. Digital stuff (and spark plugs) isn't allowed near the dishes cause they're so sensitive it will pick them up and throw off the experiments they're doing.
---
Yeah the reason why i want to ‚Äùrush‚Äù the main quests first is so i wont scavenge and roam certain places before i have done the quest that has something to do these places because otherwise it kinda ruins the place and the quest imo. 
---
I've never grown up? And a low IQ at that
---
Maybe just learn to make an actual argument that doesn't contradict itself an then we'll talk.
---
Wow, they banned the one player that passionately and consistently played the game. Rest in peace. 
---
I'll attach my screenshot once I get home of a Machine that exhibited this bug with a Nuka Cola Quantum (I'd really liked to have had that!)
---
So i cant launch the nuke several times?
---
I‚Äôd watch out, OP is definitely a bloodied melee build! 
---
That is why he is having so much fun!
---
Better watch out, Bethesda is coming for you next!
---
I just want something thats not a lead pipe
---
Game journalism is pretty bad tbh. Not surprised they failed to investigate. Their ‚Äúreporters‚Äù just sign up to follow various Reddit subs and twitter people, then scan around for a few hours a day till they see something, then employ a little high school level essay-inflation and bam, article! Slap a clickbait headline and crap it out the door.
---
Bobblehead Stacking was supposed to be fixed in patch 5, but they used old code, so who knows what actually got fixed .. smh .. must of been a glitch of some sort .. hopefully when the pvp servers come out, they will tweak the pve servers and get rid of douche bags like this .. block, report and move on I guess. Might actually be worth blocking everyone in a nuke zone, so they can't see your locations ... they can physically see you. I sometimes do this if I find people following me trying to steal my kills at WhiteSpring and using TSE or worst damn grenades really annoys me as it blows the bodies all over the place.
---
HOLY FUCK KNUCKLES TIME TO START FARMING CHALLENGES
---
I will check the map next time and confirm. 
---
There‚Äôs that which has always occurred. There was an early bug where you basically never fell because strange in numbers buffed your bird bones fall reduction too much. I‚Äôm still not sure if empath is meant to be reduced by class freak, but it appears that it isn‚Äôt. 
---
Mutations are such a neat feature, but they‚Äôre broken af
---
just use the wide windows
---
If it has ADS spread when nonlegendary, it'll have even worse spread when TS That's why shotguns and radiation weapons are bad for this comparison.
---
Personally, I'd take *anything* TS over AA, but things like shotguns are up to personal preference. I love my TSE Combat Shotgun, and it does almost 200 damage, no perks. Also, *TS is 100% of the time superior in terms of damage.*
---
nope. :P
---
I‚Äôve never been but I really want to go now, but it‚Äôs not a great idea for minorities unfortunately. My boyfriend, who is Latino, encountered a lot of racism in his trips there :( 
---
Well my TS Handmade Rifle was stronger before, almost everything is bullet sponge now!
---
Did some testing on my own, and the results are very odd. I removed my old adrenal reaction, stood in rads to get a new one. Effects listed correctly until I logged, and from now on only shows negative max HP. But, the positive effects are working, albeit much differently now.
---
From 100% to 60% HP, you get no bonus. But right away at 59% HP you get a whopping 30% damage bonus. That stays until you drop below 40% HP, when the bonus goes up to 40%. So only 10% more for that tier. Going below 30% HP boosts your damage up by 60%, and then going below 20% HP boosts damage by 80%. Falling lower than 10% HP boosts damage by 300%! 
---
Tested this using no damage perks, an unmodded lever action rifle, and radiation to lower my health. Base damage is 75, goes up to 98 at 60% HP,  105 at 40%, 120 at 30%, 135 at 20%, and 225 at 10%.
---
I am using starched genes and class freak, if that matters. One time during testing my health was just above 20% and for some reason my damage reverted back to no bonus. Healing myself back to 100% actually dropped my damage even further to well below base. Logging fixed this but it still happened.
---
I first tested all of this with all my usual perks and modded weapons, but obviously the numbers had a lot of conflicts. I don‚Äôt know all of the damage equations but bloody mess, the usual weapon damage perks like commando, as well as upgraded receivers change the numbers a lot. 
---

Once I found a submerged Explosives crate! Exactly one time!

Aww, man, you're right! I logged back in and shes as glowy as ever. I didn't discover anything! My life is a shambles!

HAY BETHESDA! FIX DIS PLZ. XD 
---
I will definitely be checking that ice chest.  I've put in almost 100 hours now and I still haven't seen a TS or an explosive.  I've had countless low level wood exterminator armor pieces, good for about 7 caps.

Let them Fight!
---
I'm the opposite.  I'd rather explore the places first and then, when I get the quests, I know where everything is. 
---
Depends what they did I'd say, if they are saying they have never duped, but have previously posted about they were duping shit i'd say yes
---
This is beyond frustrating, so yeah some players are invisible AND invincible in the same instance, meaning they can see you, you cant see or interact with them... If that player wanted he could slap damage you into oblivion and even if you shot at your feet with an explosive shotty, the only person you would hurt is you.... I tested this with a couple of friends and its a really nasty one.
---
Who actually duped that much?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt most people do like a couple hundred? 
---
There is no way everyone did 100K plus they should get anyone with a stacked legendary weapon imo. Its not possible to even get 2x the same (or at least extremely rare).
---
Well, yes, but using that logic, unmodded weapons do the most damage, because less mods = higher condition.
---
Check the battery. Maybe it‚Äôs low. Just kidding. 
---
Oooooh my nick here....nothing to do with the game Arma
---
Because video games and reddit aren't life.  It's not hard to test, I can confirm. 
---
Yup,  you have to complete forest events (sans The Messenger).  If nothing is on your screen and you‚Äôve got caps to burn for fast travel (you can use free FT to Vault 76 to help with this), approach the Tea Pot for the daily there, and the water treatment plant for the daily there.  The prison sometimes spawns an event based on proximity, as does, I‚Äôve noticed, a few of the workshop farms that spawn Project Beanstalk.  If server hopping is your game, head to Flatwoods and like every other server will have an active Fertile Soil.  Warning though, I‚Äôm 250 events deep with no love (that I recall-I‚Äôm praying I didn‚Äôt delete something before I knew its value)
---
I have a dense chest mod and 1 star in fireproof.  I can literally aim my tse combat shotgun at my feet and fire off all rounds without taking a single point of damage.
---
you could include the shed in the blast radius. would make it harder to repair stuff mid battle.. but keeps them from hiding in there as easily 
---
I couldn‚Äôt believe this either at first. Then I realized the game was only 1/2 way done when some asshole told the devs to ship it.
---
Probably because he enjoys the game. I've spent over three hundred hours, personally. But I've also fallen off the map and hardly rarely play these days. 
---
If only they could remember vanilla WOW....
---
Experience a similar battle a few days ago, 3 of us over 100 fighting the Queen, but doing little Damage, then noticed several low levels in the Shed, so I kited some mirelurks to the shed &amp; bugged out, checking the map afterwards I realized I was the highest level on the map at 133, and only 4 over 75 on the entire map.
---
I'm not sure who launched the Nuke, but if you don't have the players to kill it, it's just a huge waste of ammo.
---
I have recently been seeing players as low as level 22 at the SBQ battles, so I've started checking before going in, to save ammo, because long battles just break all my guns.
---
Where do you find the collar?  At the prison?  If so where (it's a big place)?
---
That's strange oh, I would have expected the opposite
---
Yes! 
---
I hope, in some strange way, the FO universe had it‚Äôs version of Weird Al. Or if he was exactly the same, but just covered much different songs. 
---
You're right, that isn't.
---
That's because you'll find that the multiplier for TS *is in fact smaller than AA*, but when you apply it to their respective damages, the +25% from TS makes it better.
---
Try the equation yourself and see what you get, with any damages or resists.
---
Same observation. Maps are dead. You could usually find a nuke after a few hops. Now they seem to be rare. 
---
How does this compare to this post?

---
Yeah, I'm now literally a glass canon, I can one shot almost everything, but god forbid a level 1 scorched spots me.
---
Yes. That was a long fall, too.
---
Been wondering this since the game launched. Specifically: 
---
* How big of a % boost is it per hit?
---
* How high of a % does Furious stack to? Is there a cap? 
---
* Is it multiplicative with itself? For example, if I do 1000 per shot, and it does 4% more per shot, next shot should be 1040. if it DOESN'T stack multiplicatively with itself, then 3rd shot would be 1080. If it DOES stack multiplicatively with itself, then 3rd shot would be 1081.6. That doesn't sound like a huge difference, but assuming there's no cap, it can scale quickly, and it matters A LOT.
---
* What happens if you miss? Does the stack reset?
---
* What happens if I shoot a different target but don't miss? Does each target track % multiplier separately?
---
* Is there a time frame where it will fall off if you don't score a hit?
---
Seriously, every game EVER, except for Path of Exile and Grim Dawn, glosses over VITAL information when it comes to gear, stats, and other mechanics.
---
Do Not Dumb It Down. I want to know EXACTLY how every mechanic works so that I can make informed choices when doing theorycrafting. That's like the #1 thing that I enjoy doing in RPGs - figuring out optimal play mechanics.
---
In ADS, it counts as one. Every else, it shoots 2 separate projectiles.

She drank herself to death?
---
Sneak was not nerfed.
---
A specific piece or just one piece in general?
---
Good point. Theres that side to it too lolz
---
Ok, the hide in the shed groups should suffer. they need to add a nasty spawn point in there. Non legendary super buffed level 90 tick on a 10 second respawn timer or something.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for those blossoms for the challenge. Thanks!
---
tl;dr the same system that caused this screwup prevents Bethesda from collecting accurate data on you.
---
If Bethesda is attempting to fix a dupe exploit, then they do not enforce unique item/stack IDs. These IDs prevent duplication of items or stacks by abusing mechanical or network glitches because even if you manage to create a situation in which multiple instances of a stack of ammo could exist on the server it wouldn't accept them. Since there's no offline play there's no way to even create a situation where two instances of the stack with the same ID could occur in the first place, so I'm inclined to believe they aren't using them at all.
---
This means that any ammo that enters your possession in their 30-day review is new ammo. You could drop and pick up 10k ammo ten times and their counter would increment each time. This applies to trades as well.
---
These people are incompetent. Which is news to exactly zero Bethesda fans.
---
140k ultracite rounds.  Not regular rounds.
---
It's quite difficult to make a couple hundred ultracite rounds.  The idea that he made and/or traded 260,000 rounds is laughable.

---
I am standing right behind you in Butler. How about this shitty weather?
---
A TS shotgun is worse than a regular shotgun.  The damage increase doesn't matter since you have to stand in an enemy's face in order to land all your shots.  You'd be better off using a regular shotgun and getting more shots off at a distance with more hits landing.
---
I just about managed to cover all the landmarks, though never actually made it to Diamond City (walked around the perimeter of Fenway Park) my partner didn't exactly share my enthusiasm for the pilgrimage, but as I pointed out it led us to some great landmarks including a trip out to Concord. 
---
do the weapons have reduced weight ? 
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck
---
Instigating does a single +100%, TS does +25% every hit.
---
This means that after 4 hits, TS will have done a combined +100% damage, equal to Instigating. This means that Instigating is always worse if it takes more than 4 hits to kill, or if other people or animals damage the target before you.
---
Having a location to get the flamer is an ENORMOUS help, thank you! I don't know what platform you are playing on, I'm guessing PC, but I haven't been able to get the Chainsaws to respawn for me any quicker than every 3 days or so on PS4. You may know something I don't, but that has been my experience, unfortunately. 
---
Yup, this is absolutely unacceptable.  I'm also fine with them making a balancing change, but 1) Tell us about it, and 2) make it in such a way that existing users of the perk get updated to the new method without breaking them.
---
Yeah same and the belly all distorted and if you crouch the red circles on the thighs are missing

---
Regardless of which OP was correct about how TS calculates damage, can we take a moment to talk about how terrible the Armor formula is in this game? An AA weapon should be inferior against low armor targets and really strong against high armor targets. The fact that you can compare AA and TS straight up, regardless of enemy armor shows you there is a problem.
---
We walked by, and commented on it but we didn't go in.
---
This is client side, mods are the issue, remove your mods, edit your custom ini's or wait for the mod makers to update their mod...

Search this sub, ive seen a half dozen posts about it this morning.

No but they can take down a scorchbeasts in about 45 seconds

Just be aware that if you break into the 120+ FPS, you'll start getting locked and unable to move. Apparently the "fix " for people with high FPS moving too fast was to lock people in place if they exceed 120 or so.

Well, yes. The thing is, that almost never happens against high level enemies unless you use a melee.
---
It happened to me as well but then allot of users on reddit told me to stop crying, my opinion is when you do an event together you are team mates and should treat the game as such, you want to raid do it after at another location. The trend of the game is we are all on the side of our overseer and our current objective is to do scorched earth together, if you want to role play raider do it outside our main story line, you dont like it go play farcry 
---
That's how I feel about it too. Walking through the forested areas, I see little spots that remind me of places my brother and I used to play when we were children. It may not be very strategic game play, but I try to set my bases up in areas that "feel" right vs something that is actually probably a good location.
---
Yeah, at the prison. And you can find it all over. I know it's a big place, just sort of look around near any cells there, you should find one eventually. I've found like 10 in there lol
---
why not also link to the Inside the Vault page...
---
No. I sent two yesterday and got responses to both within a few hours.
---
Tybber, what you are saying sums up the things that happen on this sub perfectly.  Those of us who are not the F-Beth band wagon type feel were you're coming from. 
---
Bethesda actually surprise me with how open they have been with this sub concerning this game; haven't seen it to this ear to the street level.
---
When Bethesda institutes a sort of Anti-bullying/Delete-non-constructive-criticism policy in their responses, then people will be really complaining about their 60 dollars spent 3 months ago smh
---
Yes, you can visually see stray projectiles. But if you compare the target's HP, you'll see that it did full damage.
---
&gt; If you add those same effects to a TS, TS is still better.
---
If armor pierce is indeed additive then this is not true in all circumstances due to the nonlinear way damage resistance enters the damage formula. For instance, take the Scorch Queen and a heavy gun with no possible armor piecing mods. Then the stabilized perk makes her have a damage resistance of (1-0.45)*300 = 165. But if armor pierce is indeed additive then stabilized + armor penetration reduces her damage resistance by a whopping *95%*, to (1-0.45-0.5)*300 = 15. Take, for instance, a 50 cal machine gun which does 36 damage with no damage perks. Then by my calculations using your formula with the stabilized perk a two-shot 50 cal will do 13.98 damage per shot, whereas an armor penetrating one will do 24.799 per shot.
---
This does, however, hinge critically on additive armor piercing.
---
More fundamentally though, armor piercing is non linear. A little bit of armor pierce usually doesn't do much, but if you manage to stack a lot of it you can reduce damage resistance by a *lot*.
---
That's really fucking cool.
---
Thanks for the location!
---
Same. If the health bar is stuck, I move on too looking for the legendaries in the mob. Move the nuke north and fight her in the south. Nowhere to hide. 
---
Yeah that sucks. 
---
I was planning on getting Fallout 76 today thinking enough time has passed, maybe it's better now with the updates and all. It seems like it's a hot garbage headache. 
---
I'm lucky in that my wife is a big Fallout fan as well so she was eager to see all the different places. We went all over the place and took tons of pictures. We didn't go into the ballpark either but we did walk the Freedom trail and see the Old North Church and went up to Salem to the Witch Museum. That area of New England is a wealth of museums and history. 
---
&gt; If crafting an item was just adding one to the number of that particular item you were carrying there's absolutely no reason that there would be lag problems.
---
Let me make this clear on lagging servers with duped inventory. 
---
Duped inventories of 1000 of the same item will *not* lag the game, or else everyone with ammo would lags servers. What *does* lag servers is 1000 unique and specific items. Aka legendary weapons each with their own specific effects, as well as all their different conditions levels. Aka you can have 4 rifles, each with different modifies and conditions, and multiply that by the thousands, and that is what will cause lag in servers. 
---
So no, crafting doesn't lag servers, having thousands of unique items will. Having thousands of nonunique will not. 
---
&gt; Stash and carry weight being another performance issue also does not support the argument that everything is simply being tracked the way you imply. 
---
How so? Stash and carry weight works the same in FO76 as it did in other TES/FO games and that is how they read items. There is no indication o say this has changed. Carry weight for example is easily explained. All the engine does is multiply its uses number by its weight, and that is the weight value shown in your carry capacity. 
---
&gt;  just not proven 
---
Go into Nexus and learn about modding tools. The information will be presented there. It's proven how the game tracks non-unique items. 
---
ü§®ü§®
---
Dense mod alone will protect pretty well. Add fire proof and you're good to go. I do break a lot of bones with my own explosions, though. Could be cause I always have bone worms...
---
&gt; his over 600K in accumulated ammo, including over 260K of ultracite ammo
---
Let's get this straight. It has no been confirmed he *has* that much ammo in his account, only that that amount has passed his inventory over 30 days. 
---
We know for a fact based on how the engine runs item IDs from previous games that it can not tell where you got non-unique items. 
---
Only that brick window. 
---
I had to replace 20+ of those in my house after I accidentally jumped through one on the 4th floor.
---
you might not be able with adrenal reaction being bugged
---
Unfortunately, that post has a few rather large errors. I'm not here to disparage anyone putting work into helping the community, but the OP of that post has not responded to my comment pointing out one of the errors nor fixed the post.  
---
In particular, this:
---
&gt;Also noting that gunpowder requires what, **3 cloth** and **5 acid**. Assuming again **super duper** and **1,355** crafts that's **54,213 acid,** and **32,528 cloth**
---
shows wildly incorrect acid and cloth values because you actually make 15 gunpowder (19.5 w/ SD3), not 1 per craft. This is important because acid would be one of the limiting factors (even more so than Flux) if the OP's calculation was correct.  
---
With this type of work peer review is very important (we ALL make mistakes) and not staying on top of your work causes bad information to percolate and eventually become part of the common lore. It then takes even more effort to undo :/
---
Haven't had those issues, but I mainly play solo.
---
That's an unnecessary ad hominem attack. Some people are really interested in game mechanics.
---
Numbers don't add up dude, you cheated somewhere down the line.
---
It took me forever to find it. As I recall, it‚Äôs under Floor Decorations on a fly out that has some statues displayed by default. It‚Äôs pretty unintuitive 
---
I posed this same question a couple months ago and got downvoted. The geck entry says it does, but no one seems to agree.
---
Id rather have a foot in my mouth than my hands on fallout 76. You guys want to keep going? I've got a bit of karma to spare :')
---
Those were just the ones that got banned.. Others that had excessive stacks of rare items, like 100 TSE shotguns or whatnot had the stack reduced to 1.
---
It's 5% per shot adding up to 50% total. Like if your weapon have 100dmg it will go up to 150.
---
I have no idea what's taking them so long to fix shit like this.
---
no. nothing in the game can mitigate 100% damage from any given source because the effects procc one after the other. they're not additive.
---
dense (66%) and fireproof 3 (45%) are more like 75% reduction. to mitigate it further, you need damage reduction (not resistance) from things like Lone Wanderer, Dodgy, etc.
---
but DR (resistance) does help, of course. the higher the better. although, at some point, it'd be better to invest in health rather than DR.
---
Yes they did fix it a community manager commented that if you had it before the update you have to remove it and reapply it to get the effect to kick in. 
---
Don't even go wanted nuking other players/camps do you?
---
Yes, visually. If you compare your target's HP, it still does the full 125%.
---
Nurgle o_o
---
Can't make them turn it on but it has never been an issue before and we have literally done dozens of zones together. So my next question is, how would dude know we were in a team? We didn't stay together and didn't need any aid from each other so couldn't be that. It is just crazy. Played since the first beta and i have never experienced this.
---
bring it
---
I *really* want blackbird
---
simple math dude.
---
"Technically", sure. If he spent the vast majority of those 900 hours just running around nuke zones picking up flux and hardened masses. Which begs the question, why is he crafting so much rare ammo if he has no spare time to use it?
---
The answer to that leads directly to another TOS violation, selling it for cash.
---
In the end, none of his excuses really hold up - one way or another, it's shady at best.
---
what's the question?  you wrote a wall of text informing the public about Bethesda's official channel of communication but didn't link to it...
---
There are 8 in the garden on the south side of huntersville.
---
One is burying a monkey, and the rest are watching from the outhouse.
---
Holy shit those are good.
---
I mean I'm still going to have to do something with all those .38 rounds I keep stacking up because I have no  38 weapons. 
---
ty
---
He probably wants to test them both head-to-head ... for science.
---
As much as I hate to say it, yes.
---
Think the catch was rare stuff like ultracite ammo, not common ammo.
---
Now we are talking!
---
You can't possibly need EVERYTHING you are carrying.  It sounds like you've been hoarding and just can't get rid of stuff because you "might" need it in the future. 
---
Chances are,  you don't need it and won't.  That's what I've learned.  Happily underencumbered for life. 
---
Mothman actually isn't as uncommon as I was expecting.  It seems if you explore really remote areas in the mountains and stay off the road, you have a chance to see one.  It'll usually get the jump on you, but one time I found one just wandering around, and it wasn't one of the ones that sees you and then vanishes.
---
yep, there's diminishing returns that get more severe at the extreme ends.  
---
That said there still is some utility to tank killer for the stagger, so it actually might be worthwhile to ditch the magazine.  
---
So for example if you have an AA handmade, you could probably swap over to the drum mag which gives i think 50 rounds.  Between tank killer and AA you'd have all the armor piercing you need and now you have a bullet hose with the same damage output.
---
It definitely does. If they expand the legendary stars in the way the files imply, explosive will be outclassed by other effects
---
I‚Äôve had that with Toxic Valley and Mire dailies, but Tea Party, Ecological Balance, Camden quests and Cop a Squatter (in Forest, Ash Heap and Cranberry Bog) will all pop by proximity.
---
This isn‚Äôt how it‚Äôs supposed to work. It‚Äôs still broken. 
---
NOW CONTENT PLEASE.
---
You guys can use the ShowHealth script to see the exact damage done to targets in numbers.
---
Thank you for doing this.  Sad to see Bethesda is still ‚Äúnerfing‚Äù and doing so without transparency.  
---
I was figuring the ban waves may have caught a lot of people with duped nuke cards. Not as easy now to find them.
---
you don't get to be a rider, sorry.
---
Yep it was ini that was required to load mods, that needed to change, just in case you didn't see the other post.
---
It's quite impossible to collect this much ammo in this short time...  he is 100% a duper or took the items of a duper. 600k+ ammo....
---
Also, 900 hours are 37,5 days playtime....
---
Hope they don't unban him. He deserved that one. No mercy for cheaters
---
yeah, but if it's so good, why would you be using another effect? And op already said in his other post he keeps info to himself to his own benefit. I don't care about that but it's worth doing your own experimenting and research :)
---
If you're on PC I'll exchange quests with you.
---
It happened to me as well. I'm in sneak mode with the red caution and nothing in VATS. The music changed to the scary percussion drumming (Death Claw anthem) lol nothing around me! I start to take heavy damage using Stimpacks too, almost died. I go into a cabin and there is no floor? Objects are in there that you run into but you can't see. I jumped to a new server and it was like a new game visually and my health was normal!? I was like ok! lol (: thank you! 
---
When you... find the secrets under Whitespring Resort, it gets explained to you that nuking plants and animals creates unique materials that have "interesting" properties. Which means in a nuke zone plants create raw unstable 'flux' of different varieties (like crimson and fluorescent). But this raw flux decays and becomes 'inert' within a few minutes. So you have to book it to a chemistry station combine 10 raw flux with the other resources you picked up from all those nuked mobs you killed (hardened mass, glowing mass and high radiation fluids) so you can create stable flux, which will keep until you need it.
---
And you WILL need it in the end game because some of the best weapons, armor and ammo in the game MUST be crafted with stable flux. 
---
Now crafting stable flux may sound like a bitch and that's because it is and doubly so considering some of the most critical flux you need (like violet or cobalt) can be super hard to find. 
---
This is why you fight the queen.
---
Because the queen, despite being widely known for dropping mediocre legendaries and ultracite armor mods, also drops a variety pack of stable flux, which saves you a ton of time picking flowers that you hope don't decay before you can fast travel to a chemistry bench. And as you can see this might be worth being a dick to someone who just helped you bring down the queen.
---
And?...You claiming in title that it is fun content, it aint.
---
Not that I've noticed.  It's still every hour or two I see a nuke dropped on ps4.
---
pretty sure the vampiric effect was nerfed like a week ago.
---
Is there a way to see the targets HP in numbers? Also, the second shot is base weapon damage without mods so not a full 125%
---
Ya best not to and definitely stay away from boon /logan county area some places there you could get shot if you went up the wrong hollow 
---
It's annoying that bugs like assaultron head using all of your cells in one shot hasn't been fixed, but anything that is beneficial gets patched asap. 
---
No, I mean I think the formula should be 125\*((100/300).366 ).5 because the multiplier is based on the base gun damage of one bullet.  The fact that you're pushing out a second bullet multiplies that by 125% not 125%\*125% = 156.25%.  The base damage of the AA is 100 per bullet too.
---
the game's engine is based off fallout 4, so with that in mind Luck affects value and a 3\* is more valuable than a 1\* so with that in mind and the current table increase, I would say Luck is important.
---
This is what sucks about the situation, who do I (we) believe? Bethesda, the company that can't fix bugs that are years old without creating more bugs, or some guy from the internet. Frankly, I wouldn't put real money down on either of those options, there is just to much uncertainty. Sadly the only people who could possibly have a paper trail and could tell what actually happened is Bethesda and they aren't exactly a pillar of integrity or competence right now.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the other guy is wrong but I'll test the bridge for myself. Doesn't make sense that the rules would be different for one particular spot on the map.
---
Launching nukes is all I do now when I'm playing. Level 103. Melee build(not glasscannon).
---
At this point it's just so easy to go through a silo solo. It's just tedious. 
---
But launching nukes is super fun,  and blowing up whitesprings is dope. THAT'S when all the players come out of the woodwork to take advantage of MY hard work hahaha
---
No new contest people are bored and playing raiders much more often now.
---
You‚Äôre not listening. I have a t45. Don‚Äôt care about a quest.
---
I'm not banned nor are any of my friends, the reason I care is because there is already substantial doubt in Bethesda,  if they wrongfully ban a whole set of people there is less people in a game I enjoy that should be there.
---
I want the people who duped banned, but by that same token I dont want the game to die because Bethesda screwed up yet another thing they have done with it.
---
Oddly you can be guilty of nothing and still care about those also guilty of nothing, it's called empathy,  you should learn to try it sometime.
---
You come here saying everyone is guilty as if you have any proof of such, people like you are what's wrong with the world today, believing the world is centered on your narcissistic self with no desire to help others.   Again good luck in life your going to need it.
---
Here's how it (likely) works.
---
When you need to update, the patch needs to apply to a *copy* of your working file(s), it doesn't apply them to the original file(s) in case something goes wrong.  Once the copy is updated, it replaces the old file and frees up space by removing the old files.
---
So, you'll effectively have 2 copies of the program loaded on your drive until the installation is over.  Hence the need for the extra space.
---
This is pretty normal behavior.  I've seen this exact situation in a lot of games, it's just most notable on big AAA games.
---
It is possible to mitigate some of the need for the extra space if the program is split up into a lot of individual pieces that can be updated separately, but since HD space is actually pretty cheap, and this limitation really only causes problems in a tiny percentage of people, there's little incentive add extra work to prevent it.
---
Well I have the plan so won‚Äôt be that bad I‚Äôm resetting mutation anyways I got herbivore :/
---
I've failed 2 out of the last 3 SBQ events. Last night there was 10 people at the event, and me and 2 others firing at the queen.
---
Everyone else (low levels in rad suits included) was farming mobs.
---
What a waste of 5.56.
---
 In the mire there are many places where you need to be able to wade without taking damage. Before I took it I went through radaway just fighting Swamp Creatures.
---
Thanks.  I'll try it.
---
Nope. A weapon that takes,  maybe an hour to fire, gives several minutes notice when it's incoming, makes getting out of its way a legit quest and displays the blast radius for all to see is the worlds shittiest PVP weapon lmo. 
---
K, got it dude, but seriously, it can be tough and seems bad at first, but when you get used to it - you'll never come back.
---
Thank you for the suggestions and being so helpful. I've actually tried editing my custom ini's based on the advice of a few of those posts you're probably talking about lol.. that's what fixed my player icons. I've removed my mods hoping it would help with the other textures but so far nothing has worked so I'm looking at trying to reinstall once my internet is more stable. Thanks though!

One on the patio table always outside Watoga train station. Several sitting in the stands at Watoga civic center, several sitting in the jury box below the Watoga mayors office.
---
It's amazing people somehow enjoy this game :D
---
Wonder how.
---
And how they continue playing it.
---
That's up to personal preference. However, it's a fact that TS does more damage than AA and nonlegendary.
---
I personally think my TSE Combat Shotgun's increased damage is more than worth it, especially vs groups.
---
I wrote about people not keeping themselves informed. I linked two official Bethesda accounts. One of them is one that will repost all official Fallout information here. The other is the main customer service rep that deals with reddit, and gives feedback and passes on information. 
---
Posting to one Inside the Vault isn't what I'm talking about.
---
So you seem to have missed the point. 
---
And still my Healing Factor mutation doesn‚Äôt work either because the endless ‚Äòcaution‚Äô I have,
---
It‚Äôs like the game get only more worse than it was....
---
Well offer is open.  It's only the duped level 40 one though.
---
Ah that explains why I haven‚Äôt heard of it yet. I haven‚Äôt been strong enough to explore white springs. Too many level 60 charred ghouls there all the time 
---
All was fine before patch 6 and when a ghoul hits me in PA I see a huge drop in health, before the patch the health drop was much less. Nothing changed in my build.
---
You have the AA math right but the two-shot math wrong.
---
Two-shot compares the full 125% damage against the target's damage resistance, then the final damage is split between to projectiles.
---
AA is still "better" but the difference is only ~1.3% of actual damage.
---
Because Bethesda made it known they were coming for dupers before the bans came out.
---
If they did it your way, the dupers drop everything in a bag and play innocent before the bans come out.
---
Also, the primary problem in duping is not the individual characters, but the ones who dupe and then ebay.
---
He could probably use some time off from the game anyway
---
Now if our state officials would stop farting on live tv we could probably get more tourists XD
---
It does seem like it, yes. 
---
I mean hell, I'm at my computer and I don't want retest everything, take screenshots, and post them on a separate site I rarely use just prove to something to some stranger who won't do the tests themselves.  I just want to play Fallout.
---
The part that says they can ban you for anything.
---
Ugh, I didn't want to buy more Atoms... very cool...
---
You kids and your wacky maths. I'll put my faith in tea leaves and scattered chicken bones, thank you very much!
---
Yep. Rng is a cruel master. Destiny taught me that. The final nail in the coffin was when id been grinding for weeks on heroics. Tryin to get some sniper rifle that didnt spend bullets if you got crit head shots. Ima friggin sniper build in all my games so my buddies knew this rifle was on my list. 
---
Last run of the weekend. A drunkard who played like shit from a fellow team got it. 
---
"Ima shard it i dont even use snipers lolz" 
---
Id carried that muthafucka so many times. I just seethed with anger. Everyone could hear it in my voice. His luck was stupid. He had it all and thought it was funny.  "I fucking hate you and i will no longer play with your pathetic ass" 
---
Yep. My bff was like bro calm down. I shut down my ps4. And uninstalled destiny the next day. I was pissed for weeks. Still havent played destiny and wont play anthem either. Screw those guys
---
Oh, so regardless of if the 2nd projectile hits, you still get 25% more damage? I wonder if it just boosts the damage by a small amount rather than firing a true secondary round.
---
The T-45's helmet looks a little bit like that Deathclaw-themed Power Armor helmet someone here did a while back
---
Yeah, i know you can't make them turn it on, that's their choice. Try it out with your team, have one person leave the team and initiate pvp with one of the team and see if it drags you all in. 
---
I've played since first beta too and only started experiencing this when I started teaming up with people who don't use pacifist mode. I'd test it out for you but I don't have any friends left who play the game! 
---
If you're pvping they can see a red arrow above your head to see if you're counted as an enemy.
---
I mean like... You right, and you ain't wrong when you right
---
Damn, I have noticed that my damage was nerfed since the last patch and I always make sure to max my hunger and hydration bars. Looks like I'm officially on a diet.
---
it's kinda hard to pinpoint what exactly is the broken because the same patch that nefed your vampiric weapon also introduced the rad worms bug.
---
do you have mutations? because maybe the rad worm "bonus" was masquerading the nerf by boosting something else.
---
Also a ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù option for people who keep asking you if you want to trade with them.
---
Well, seeing as reward is you left with no gameplay, the grind *is* the point. 
---
Last time I was real into playing, I'd jump on my stealthsniper and I'd snag grafton steel, ammo factory and red rocket just to keep up with crafting ammo for my 2shot +50% limb dmg handmade. Get at least 1.5k ammo, then grab my anti armor lever action and launch a nuke at whitepsring or queen. Then rinse and repeat. Building up workshops (why I take red rocket, aluminum for fusion gen is like 25) is pretty dang fun, I like to leave signs saying "Kiliox was here" and hope someone takes them over before the server crashes :)
---
As for fusion cores, I gave up on my PA melee girl after they nerfed the processors at power plants. Then I got a map of fusion cores in the wild, but now they've nerfed the wild cores and buffed the processors to half of what they were during beta? Yeah, I'm confused, so, I don't get on my melee character anymore, lmao. 
---
Papa Nurgle is down with the sickness. *^(AHHHH-WAAA=AHHH-AHHHH-AHHHH)*
---
Paying $60 to be Q and A testers.
---
But instead of reporting bugs for modders to fix, you report bugs to a team of folks thats never fixed a bug in their life.
---
And one wonders why they dont hire modders.
---
"Finally, there is no fix for the bulk items autoscrapping with the "Scrap All Junk" button."
---
JFC Bethesda. 
---
This is what I do so much anymore. I figure it hard crashes often enough that alt F4 can't really be that bad.
---
they either broke it or ninja nerfed it. the change was dramatically noticeable for me.
---
Seen people declaring with 100% certainty that the game was going f2p. Then with 100% certainty that the game was getting loot boxes. Then with 100% certainty that they were banning people for just crafting items.
---
Hopefully Excavator gets skins just as cool and creative as those, though. 
---
&gt; Duped inventories of 1000 of the same item will not lag the game, or else everyone with ammo would lags servers. What does lag servers is 1000 unique and specific items. Aka legendary weapons each with their own specific effects, as well as all their different conditions levels. Aka you can have 4 rifles, each with different modifies and conditions, and multiply that by the thousands, and that is what will cause lag in servers. 
---
&gt; So no, crafting doesn't lag servers, having thousands of unique items will. Having thousands of nonunique will not. 
---
This one is pretty simple. If I spam-craft boiled water as fast as I can (prior to the 1 second limit in yesterday's patch) the server lags noticeably for both me and other players. Others have commented on the same behavior quite frequently. The act of crafting these non-unique items is generating lag, implying but not proving that your understanding of how they are tracked is incomplete. Hard to test this with the new patch slowing crafting but it was absolutely a thing. 
---
&gt; How so? Stash and carry weight works the same in FO76 as it did in other TES/FO games and that is how they read items. There is no indication o say this has changed. Carry weight for example is easily explained. All the engine does is multiply its uses number by its weight, and that is the weight value shown in your carry capacity. 
---
Bethesda has stated the limited stash weight (as opposed to the initial claim of "unlimited" is due to performance issues. While it may be only unique items that are the problem, in Fallout 4 it is possible to use the console to give yourself insane carry weights (guilty as charged) and there are no performance issues. If adding things to a stash box is just a item identifier and quantity then this shouldn't be an issue for non-unique items and they would only have to limit storage on unique ones. This might be the case, nobody knows unless they have server access.
---
&gt; Go into Nexus and learn about modding tools. The information will be presented there. It's proven how the game tracks non-unique items. 
---
This proves nothing about how non unique items are tracked on the server-side unfortunately, only the client side so it is not comprehensive.
---
I dont think so. I think it's just been bad luck on your part. I mean, imagine if multiple scorch beasts went after each person in this manner, the skies would darken with their unholy flapping.
---
/r/market76
---
thanks for this, been arguin with a friend since nerf, basically tossed his tse away and respec'd melee, think it may just be his excuse wanting to break 1k dmg so to 1shot everything still which i dont mind just the fact of the tse garbage now and tryin to do the no its not. 
---
i run vats sniper, also hip fire quite a bit as well as ADS. ive noticed the differences in what you have math'd out, i have several of the same types of lever action, AA, E, TSE, trying to find myself an AAE, and a TSE handmade, ive gotten to where i swap rifles depending on vats/hip/ADS shots. 
---
Reading this makes it amazing how folks enjoy this game.
---
Wonder how they do it.
---
glorf12 just bring these motherfucker to the court. demand compensation so much that their whole company get sold to arrange that money. consumer laws says u can't change the product uve promised to customer for. patching means changing original product. get these bastards . don't let them get away with it. if uve made that ammo without any cheating don't b afraid . just Sue them. be a man. set an example. the whole gaming community is with u
---
We are the Test server.
---
Also, as someone who has scrapped countless chainsaws...did you ever eventually learn the Flamer mod, or does it have to be bought or found as a single use item? I was shocked to only unlock 2 mods after scrapping 8 chainsaws, and it was only the first two I scrapped that taught me the plans. 
---
You get that from the fix it good perk
---
I went and sat on the food factory until it produced 50 Salisbury steaks (and put 40 of them into my stash).  Then I stopped collecting glowing meat for glowing meat steaks.  Beforehand, Thru-Hiker made a 50 lb difference in weight.  Now I'm just keeping about 10 steaks and 15 purified water to feed my Speed Demon.
---
My problem is things like a 3\*Vampire Super Sledge, an Instigating Handmade, 2-shot Handmade (that's 50 lbs right there), an anti-armor Gatling Laser, Explosive Gatling Plasma, etc.
---
Bloodied is more damage when played under the right conditions. However, bloodied doesn't work for everything. Every build has a purpose and there is no one size fits all. Likewise, this whole argument is moot if we're talking about what legendary weapon a crit reliant character should use. AA is just better for that.
---
People used to have these same analytical arguments about two-shot and instigating back in fallout 4. There's nothing suspect about peoples' motivations here. It's just people arguing about how they see the game mechanics working in-game
---
Playing this shit like a full time job. Bethesda owed him some vacation time.
---
Just don‚Äôt play the game anymore. Don‚Äôt buy anything in the shop. The way Bethesda is treating the game and their community has disappointed me too often, I stopped playing a few weeks ago and just come here for some laughs. It‚Äôs hilarious they still fuck up. No wait, it‚Äôs sad. 
---
WTF is this serious? How can anyone be so oblivious? Just post a youtube video it's the SAME THING! WTF?! Is this seriously 2019??? WTF!
---
I'm desperate for RP content too but at least i try to organize.
---
1. It was easy and fun! (BOTH)
---
2. No RNG or Boss fights for OP gear ... you just had to find it! (F76 has OP gear you have to grind for)
---
3. No grinding for toon levels and abilities. (F76 has levelling system)
---
4. Zombies were killable. Wolves were a challenge (en mass), and I was sad when Bears got nerfed! (F76 has more to kill, but not too troubling)
---
5. The map was fun to explore! (BOTH)
---
6. You could be old, slow, the phone would ring, could relax with a beverage, play with an old rig and it didn't matter. (BOTH ... IMO, but some of the more tricky npcs require co-op)
---
7. Just find a spot, build a base, claim a car, and your free to relax with mates until next server wipe. (ummm ...)
---
I think the perk you are looking for is called fix it good
---
I've never heard of programs doing this. I can still update a Steam game with an X GB update as long as I have at least X GB free. I can move the game to my hard drive but it seemed to take forever to load when it was on the hard drive. But I need 100 GB to update a 50 GB game? If so that is a shitty system. 
---
You attacked him for disagreeing with you.
---
Hahahaha that is a good one
---
NO SALT! Not going to read past the first title go whine somewhere else.
---
This is unacceptable. All of my char require a prisoner collar so that I can roleplay OZ. 
---
Every Developer has a Test Server, some are just lucky enough to have it separate from Prod.
---
Nice smokescreen :D
---
Likely rad worms bonus
---
Ughh...you're correct. I'm going to delete this post and start over. I knew I should have looked up the right name instead of going off of memory.
---
Yeah... There were plenty of people there at a high enough level. Shit. Even my buddy, who, in the past, being level 20 something helped kill two queens. 
---
Or a no trade icon over your map name. I hate people trailing me like a puppy wanting to trade. 
---
Isnt bethesda famous of doing this?
---
I really think they should have several Pit stops along his route where he will chill for 10 or 15 minutes AND shoot off some fireworks or flares every once in awhile. I only say this because I can never find him if I‚Äôm looking, but when I just play the game regularly I‚Äôll see him every once in awhile. Last couple times I saw him he was in Charleston Landfill after a defend event.
---
I wonder if events have anything to do with his spawn-in. Or if he is always somewhere out in Appalachia?
---
I read the F out of it when I got mine. The ToS and Code of Conduct arent actually that long. Plus you can use CTRL-F to find what you need. 
---
Unfortunately, the end game (SBQ farm) flat out requires not just good, but godly legendary weapons to take down. If you don't have a few people with some combo of TSE, BE, or similar weapons, she just isn't going down. I like that it's challenging, but it's very much a situation of "have's" and "have nots". 
---
Played 2 hrs last night and was so happy not to be overencumbered (Thanks new stash limit!) and had ZERO problems with my stealth. 
---
I did notice that my hidden meter would fluctuate if I tried Running while crouched. If I moved slowly it maintained much better near targets.
---
Yes, AA + more AA perks is better than plain TS. But that's an unfair comparison, because you didn't add those perks to TS as well when comparing. If you do, you'll see that TS is still better.
---
I have no hands now when i hold the handmade rifle in first person wearing it.
---
Yea If you can‚Äôt tell there‚Äôs an effort to publish ever problem the game has no matter how insignificant to try to smash it because they want to kill it and it makes them sick that millions are actually playing it. Mostly the PC crowd are the ones who are attacking it seems.
---
You might wanna say .. "In My opinion" .. Cause its not fun battling the thing with 4 lvl 100+ and 10 lvl 30's to 90's .. Cause we ain't killing her And I chew through thousands of rounds and its not fun.  And she still has a huge landing problem even with people hitting her with a Cryolater.  
---
THOUGH last night we had one that after the timer played out, She stayed grounded for another 5 mins never flew away and we killed her .. had to of been a glitch. 
---
Yeah last night the most I got up to in group was 1.9k. Which was like "ohhh no, now I have to hit TWO TIMES instead of one?! Fuck off Bethesda" /s. I think the biggest part of TSE was bobbleheads and ranged damage. My at max 2.5k (more if sneaking) in your face damage was nothing compared to your 8k from half the map away. 
---
Sounds like someone could use some weight reduction armor haha
---
Warframe has been in beta for 5+ years and is polished, feel more feature complete and feels like it has no bugs after playing 76.
---
And Warframe still in beta.....
---
To be honest I've never been able to hide from scorchbeasts or even outrun their aggro zone. When I encounter one I usually just switch worlds.
---
It‚Äôs actually not near as bad as these people make it seem to be. 
---
You‚Äôre not the only one. And now thanks to the subreddit, he will probably get unbanned.
---
Dupers get banned for breaking the rules and feign innocence.
---
Your response to *everyone* who disagrees with you in these comments has been some version of "you're exactly what I'm talking about, you illiterate rage machine." üòÇ
---
Lol.  Already have 2 pieces.
---
praise be\~
---
&gt; TS is treated as a single projectile in ADS; this is why there's no spread
---
This is untrue. Two-shot increases spread multiplier, aiming down the sights and crouching both reduce the spread multiplier. I stopped using TS weapons because I could observe by two shots going to either side of a monster's head.
---
No, I responded to his first post with the example of doing a bad job at work thing. Because he was just posting whatever hate he wanted to post about the game and Bethesda. 
---
In short, he's not reading, he's only interested in posting his hate about the game.
---
And your backing him up. 
---
Yong is great. Thanks for giving him more attention. Idiot. 
---
Yep.  I have my house set up with no doors.  I just use Marsupial to jump into the second floor windows.
---
https://giant.gfycat.com/LimitedMessyBrontosaurus.webm
---
Just cosmetic to other players, they can still see you. When it comes to regular enemies, it seems to make you harder to detect but not invisible to them completely.
---
You see the crashed satellite every once in a while if you server hop at Charleston station trying to get the vendorbot.
---
I would do bad things for a Combat dense mod :(
---
My primary weapon is a furious handmade, and my impression is that the stacks don't reset with a miss, but do reset and start stacking anew when a new target is hit. 
---
The oft-cited 5% per hit up to 50% total sounds credible. 
---
Even without formal testing I can confidently confirm that there's a cap (or limit function) because damage doesn't noticeably continue to scale against bullet-sponge creatures like SBs, Mirelurk Queens or Behemoths. 
---
I completely agree though. We need more formal testing. I guess I need to see if I can enroll my friends as target-practice guinea pigs. 
---
I have a ssd in my ps4 and there are games with much longer loading times.
---
The real shock was the almost absence of that anoying freeze. Now it just skips a frame but at least you won't be killed while loading.
---
Gaming journalism knows which way the wind blows when it comes to popular opinion of this game (lul u play 76? Heckin dweeb). Crafting an article in that tilt will get you loads of views, just like the hatetube videos get. 
---
They're just jumping on the bandwagon tbh.
---
You can do it against players and ask them their HP.
---
3 more to go! In all seriousness I carry multiple rifles and it‚Äôs a life safer, I hate PA and love to run reeeeeeeeally fast 
---
Lmao i just commented the same thing
---
Keep up the good work, your server thanks you!
---
Controversial sells and research is, like, totally boring zzzzzzzz.
---
Yes. Have you ever seen a group of mole rats, killed one, and had the others burrow underground? They will follow you to the ends of the earth without being stealth and will pop up exactly where you are if you are stealth. It's a bug, but it's also the only thing that handicaps a stealth build and making it too OP
---
Oh it‚Äôs in photomode sadly
---
well fuck me.  That was like the one stop I would make and look forward to.  Can't we have anything nice?
---
You guys are just assholes. Making a game which is just a fucking joke and taking zero shit to your customers. Selling trash bags as a canvas shit. Making trash jacket. Even your hardcore fans are making fool of you. And banning one of your hardcore fan? How deep you still can fall? How ridiculous you could be? You should get lost from gaming market forever with your disgusting attitude and products. I'm tired to hate you because there's no fucking point anymore. You Bethesda are the most disgusting company I've ever seen on my 20years of gaming history. Even the Activision is way more better than you. Congratulations morons.
---
It was the combination of his main account and associated count. 
---
Ultracite ammo is the main culprit. it doesn't drop in the world. You have to craft it. It is 1 ultracite and 1 violet flux per 180 + lead, steel and gunpowder.  He had to use 1,000 of each to hit his total numbers, even with using super duper. and like 12,000 steel, 15,000 lead and 5,000 powder (off of memory, can't quite remember the exacts).
---
Ultracite is easier to get than flux. I could conceive he grinded out over 1,000 ultracite ore... but violet flux? he'd have to be running like 10+ SBQ a day every day. and even then the choke point is the harden masses and radiation fluids. They do not drop in numbers equal to the amount of flux you can get. 
---
Then he had to get the other stuff. Most people know how to grind lead and iron with the excavator armor, but we are back at acid being the choke point. Acid cannot be generated in the quantities he needs here, particularly at the 5 per 15 needed for gunpowder. Hemlock hole is your best bet and it will net you something like 100-120/hr with all three acid extractors going...
---
Then add that in with his other hundreds of thousands of rounds of other ammo, and you are quickly getting in the low hundred thousands of resources needed. even with picking up ammo in the wild or buying ammo. 
---
Is it possible he crafted it all legitimately? sure. maybe. it is exceedingly unlikely and this is not a court of law. 
---
Maybe he got tagged by a tick right as he landed.
---
People who make those threads maybe the dev team posing as players :D
---
And they flood the thread w/ positivity and may even delete negativity and their posting rights.
---
&gt; No speculation whatsoever. The ticket shows he created 225,000 ultracite ammo at the very least.
---
The ticket says he "acquired" "over 100,000" ammo. If I trade 10k ammo to someone and they trade it back to me, have I just "acquired" an extra 10k ammo? There is a very good possibility that Bethesda's tracking code thinks that to be the case.
---
Yeah what are both those things? Are they new? I haven't played lately (Jan 12th I think). I mean when I did play I got all the achievements and think I ended around level 160 or so I played a good bit (not the most, but I thought I saw everything worth seeing).
---
The truth hurts people like them. 
---
Backing him up by pointing out that you accused him of being too defensive after you attacked him?
---
I'm stealth sniper, so I need my Chameleon, regeneration and 2 50% fall damage pieces.
---
It has the same creatures i killed for last weeks challenge checked. No idea if it's counting the new ones or not.
---
Which also means that I'm carrying two sniper rifles, a handmade and a combat shotgun at all times
---
Same just remove and equip it again while you have your rifle out.
---
So just to be clear...Vault 76 is NOT a real thing?
---
What none of the articles mention is that there are 2.1k hours in 3 months and mr. 900 is OBVIOUSLY addicted to video games. 
---
Sorry, waxapple is my boyfriend and was logged in as me when he posted the above comment without realising. I have no idea on how to math so I will grab him and have him reply on his own account! 
---
Dr formula for energy weapons is already super shitty and hurts energy damage overall
---
before that patch you could run behind a tree and crouch with escape artist to lose them
---
You may have to wait until the next ES has been out and milked to death as much as Skyrim before this happens, if it happens.
---
The rivers of Skyrim may have to freeze over :D
---
I just throw it away saves on weight.
---
I never multiplied anything by 1.25 until the end.
---
The equation is to find the multiplier, using base damage and target's resist. Once you find that decimal answer, you apply it to the base damage.
---
I followed some of the Quests early, and thus received reward items at lower than desired levels, as well as struggling to get through many things, at around level 50 with most of the quests completed, I finally learned the game mechanics well enough to realize what a mistake I had made.
---
Now at level 135+ it seems a bit irrelevant for my main character, but will play the next one much differently, and I now offer the following advice to new players I meet;
---
1. Do not Cross the savage Divide before level 45
---
2. Explore thoroughly, and learn to farm everything you need efficiently.
---
3. Ignore the Main Quest line &amp; concentrate on events till you reach level 45 or so,
---
Along with the advice, I often give them a BOS Recon Rifle, leather Armor, a Protective Vault Suit, and enough Purified water &amp; diluted Stimpaks, to get them by for a few days.
---
T60 only worthy skin. Sadly tho, I don't use PA, if I was still playing.
---
Thanks so much for replying, and I gotten my account suspended as well my main and I send a huge long ticket to Bethesda support and I was being extremely honest. If they open my ticket and see what I‚Äôve said I hope they don‚Äôt banned me I mean I was telling the truth I get that I don‚Äôt have evidence to it but I was telling the truth from the heart, I have no reason to lie to have my account banned. (I‚Äôm no duper but admitted my wrongs.) when I read the forum that Bethesda posted and notice there was a message saying ‚ÄúIf you think you are experiencing an exploit in your gameplay experience ‚Äî stop using t immediately and let our support team know in a ticket. I‚Äôve never exploited in the game never intended to do so, so the way choice was to admit my wrongs in a ticket. 
---
 Lucky is what you are. I scan the skies at The Whitspring in hope my lady of madness will appear. I got 3 level 80s last week. They look so good all piled around the place.
---
Skins? looks like brand new armor. Also i remember 4 horsemen quest in fallout shelter
---
From the Community Patch Notes posting looks like they did.
---
What's the rad work issue?
---
&gt;They didn't say that two of his characters have that much ammo. They said two of his accounts,
---
No wrong on both. The number was not amount of ammo IN posession. Check the email what was the wording using, but it's not clear how exactly they are calculating. Ammo picked up, ammo in posession at intervals checked, ect ect, it could be anything except spesifically the email was clear not to claim that amount of ammo in possession.
---
The point was he claimed the number could be so big because he swapped it between characters. So because he may swap it between some characters not all, it could very well result to the numbers were not equal between accounts.
---
Oooh..touch√© that‚Äôs tough. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever carried a shotgun in my life
---
So, this works even if you're not running mods, FYI. 
---
yeah running while crouched isnt supposed to affect stealth with escape artist, but it does because it is broken
---
I already have a TSE, thanks man. I'm interested in BE, if you have any, though.
---
I knew there was something odd about the whole situation. Now thanks to the outcry of the subreddit he‚Äôs probably gonna get unbanned. 
---
It gets worse.  Adrenal Reaction was actually nerfed so health &gt; 60% no longer provides a damage bonus.
---
I get that you need to make balance changes but we should be informed, and when you convert the mutation into the balanced version, you should convert players who use it automatically without leaving us in a broken state that we then have to figure out how to fix on our own.
---
Dude, what kind of retard keeps swapping ammo back and forth though?
---
First thing I thought as well!
---
So you're all saying that that state, like every other state, has some bad areas and racism? So it's like every other place on the entire planet. Got it. Nice insight. 
---
Well if you do unyielding as well I have found the extra strength to be really helpful too
---
You need to apply your skepticism in both directions.  'Cause his story doesn't add up, regardless of your opinion of Bethesda.
---
His first post was to say that I was saying it's ok that there are mistakes in the game and that we shouldn't hold Bethesda accountable.
---
I didn't even come close to that. This isn't even about that. it's about that the fact that there's a lot of answers to peoples questions that they are missing because they don't keep themselves informed.
---
That's what this post is about. 
---
Both of you have failed to get that. And that's why you are both examples of what I'm talking about. You are so intent on pointing out some truth about Bethesda that you can't take in what someone else is saying. 
---
it's right up with this kind of post. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ash1v5/has_anyone_considered_the_possibility_that/
---
Yes. He's nailed it. Bethesda spent all this money and time just so you DON'T play the game.
---
In ADS, it's always considered a single projectile. In hipfire, they're considered separate projectiles, at 62.5% each.
---
Ultracite ammo needs more than just lead and iron, it needs stable flux. Stable flux is a gated resource, it requires nukes to be dropped, and then harvesting an uncommon drop from critters as well as a non-respawning (within the period of a single nuke) ground harvest within said nuke zone. You can \*maybe\* make 3 stable flux per nuke due to these limits. So, some quick math tells me that  in the very best case scenario (finding enough unstable flux to make 3 per nuke, and only making 5mm or .50 cal ammo), he ran 500 nuke zones to get enough to craft the ammo.  
---
With 900 hours in, sure, he could have done it, server hopping to find nuke zones and getting lucky with hardened mass drops off meat piles and pinging SB's to get them to spawn scorched, provided he spent a pretty significant portion of that 900 hours just harvesting nuke zone to make ammo. 
---
But the fact that he could have done it doesn't really cover the reason why he felt he needed half a million rounds of ammo, and raises uncomfortable questions about whether he was selling it for cash on the side. In other words, it's not hard to see how Bethesda smelled something funny about this. 
---
Probably will get plague walker first since it's the crappy one
---
Thank you for the info. If we assume that it caps at 50%, I'd assume that would make it slightly better than TS or AA against SBQ? Still behind Bloodied by a significant margin (assuming today's "nerf" is actually an error), although  Furious / TS / AA don't require you to play suicidally like Bloodied does, so they have that going for them.
---
NP, good luck!
---
I read your post in it's entirety and you say it's not a post defending Bethesda, and it starts out that way, but towards the end you end up completely defending Bethesda, and I read most of your replies to people in the comments, all you do is get defensive and claim the person didn't read the post...
---
&gt;The bottom line is this. They are trying. They aren't getting it all perfect every time. But they are trying. 
---
no, the bottom line is the game as it stands now, much better than it was a launch, still isn't a full retail release $60 game, it just isn't.  Bethesda for their part has listened to the community, the problem is the community is split, they always are, that's why most AAA devs have minimal interaction with their audience, because half want it one way and half the other.  The recent patches have been good, but what you are suggesting is we should just accept that they are trying when in reality the game should still be in BETA, or early access...
---
&gt; Maybe some of you need to stop being so entitled and some of you actually need to keep yourself informed. 
---
I am well informed thank you, and I am not entitled for wanting a complete and mostly bug free experience for $60, there's certain expectations when you take a game out of BETA and put it on retail shelves for $60, that's not entitlement that's reality.  once again I will say the patches have been good steps in the right direction, but just today, in on session, I had at least 3 major bugs...  the biggest was the SBQ falling through the map and no one getting the loot, thank god I didn't launch that nuke, another was the t-pose PA bug, that they said was fixed a few patches ago, had to kill myself to fix that one, another was when I was trying to take over an unowned workshop and the last enemy wasn't there, just a floating quest marker and no way to finish taking over the workshop, I just logged out after that one...
---
yeah, there are shit people that just shitpost, but you know what's worse, pretending nothing is wrong with the game and raising pitchforks and torches for anyone that thinks about criticizing Bethesda or Fallout 76, to be clear I am not saying you are the latter, but you are defending them...  so don't come in here and tell me I am entitled.
---
After all these years on the internet im still nor sure what americans mean when they say "Issue". I believe the word is "problem", but I'm not sure, but if you are server hopping to solve a problem, its an issue. You shouldnt need to server hop to get enough plastic. Thats what I'm talking about, plastic is too precious because of the bulking and the shotgun and the laser ammo.
---
i am following both posts and i wanted to hop in on this conversation and commend both op's of both posts for actually discussing and both agreeing to continue testing.  it is really a breath of fresh air to actually see two differing opinions around here not turn into a "screw you, youre stoopid... no screw you, youre stoopid" arguments. 
---
thank you both for being willing to go above and beyond to dig into it to help find out info to the betterment of all the player base, and sharing this work.
---
Those are weird....
---
Steam may have some games that are more modular, but I've had steam games unable to update for the same reason.  I think it just depends on the game.  And, all that is also the reason I got a 1TB ssd to move everything to, tired of space issues.  Granted, I can afford the $150 easily and not everyone can, but in reality your option is going to be to manage your disk space, or increase it.  There isn't another solution that I'm aware of.
---
Out of curiosity why don't you use their official forums to contact them? Shouldn't reddit be for fun?
---
Don't you feel the need to post proof, like with a video?
---
Nah. If you're still here, bitching about people bitching, I'm going to continue to kill time here having various conversations with various people, even hypocritical people like you.   
---
There is a mild to moderate chance at best. That said, sure. Devils advocate there is a chance he was wrongfully banned based on a history of buggy results in game.
---
 That said when it comes to banning they seem to have been doing their research and the mods even made a post about how most have proven true and the bans should be trusted.
---
I trust the bans. I didnt cheat and i even did the xp glitch for a couple levels and i am not banned. That should have been a flag right there. These were likely the top of the iceberg easy things to point put to players. Not the sum or whole.
---
That also being said, you shouldn't accept items you know are made by dupers in the qty of 10,000s
---
That's a super odd mechanic then. Lesson learned: always aim down sights when using TS weapons.
---
Youre in a reddit of a bugged riddled exploited to death hellscape.
---
What did you expect? People to hold hands and sing kumbaya?
---
Yes, if you hipfire often, maybe go with AAE. Raw max damage, TSE is better.
---
 I have Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs and like you take 0 damage. Its strange at first but you get used to it. "Got another missile?" ;)
---
They are my Scrochbeast hunting clothes. ;)
---
I didn't get banned, even though I repeatedly took some grenades from a trap. So I've uninstalled the game, doesn't really feel like punishment though.
---
Yeah, I'm not gonna spend $150 for a 1 TB ssd. 
---
War looks like a Khorne Berzerker
---
Now they're cooking. Notice that the models are actually different and not just colored different. Still though, If these cost more than 2k atoms each I'm going to be a sad panda. Also the plague guys eyes should be green :p
---
I saw a post on a comic book website as well saying he got unfairly banned. I didnt want to make an account and tell the "journalist" he forgot to do his research on the matter.
---
Also the comments are ppl circle jerking to who played this game more than 5 minutes?
---
I'm currently running Dodgy and Lone Wanderer in a Bloodied PA build. I'm considering dropping Dodgy as I am not sure I get much from it in PA, but it'll definitely be in any non-PA build I do.
---
With a full bolstering setup, I was able to get up to nearly 900 DR in BOS Heavy Combat.
---
I think I'll test out the full shebang of defence then start removing points one by one and see how I go.
---
That's my fear, and that's why the "it's not a big deal" people make me see red. They're the reason bethesda feels comfortable lying to us, because they have a cash paying segment of the fan base that doesn't care about holding the company to their word, and will actively attack anyone who tries to do so. 
---
Yes, visually, it goes stray. When you look at the target's HP, you will see it still does the full 125%.
---
I‚Äôd also like to know, I currently have Dense and 3 in fireproof, which works great, but. I‚Äôve never tried 2 in fireproof to compare, which would free up an additional perk point for me?
---
The Gauss is my favorite weapon since FO3 and when I started FO76 I do recall my normal Gauss inflicting way more damage compared to now. I have a feeling it fell in the nerf pool along the way.
---
Seriously. 
---
Even if he had like 20k and swapped it back and forth, like his dumbass claims, what kind of indecisive person does that? It's such a flimsy excuse.
---
Actually, *I did*. Two shot with *no* anti armor perks for a 50 cal machine gun doing a base damage of 36 does 11.237 damage per shot.
---
Well shit I really should have tried that more often.
---
I heard someone yesterday say they ran through regular loops every day just to calm their OCD. I'm betting they aren't the only player like that.
---
I personally would just log in daily out of habit, and didn't stop playing until I stepped back and took a hard look at whether anything I was doing was actually worthwhile or fun.
---
I have a furious lever action, as long as I can hold VATS and consecutive hits there is a noticeable stacked damage to SB's. They're the only thing that survives enough consecutive hits to noticeably stack damage.
---
I'm sure there's a cap, but it's impossible to determine without testing.
---
I haven't said anything at all about Bethesda or the frustrations you expressed in your post, and I'm still part of the problem? Are you sure that the problem isn't really your psychic ability to identify the opinions, emotional states, and undeclared motivations of people on Reddit?
---
It is actually possible though, especially if you're working as a group. I have numbers if you're interested:  
---

---
He got a twitter fer sure
---
Agreed, there's no hard proof whatsoever that the guy has been duping. He could have very easily "tricked" whatever mechanic is keeping track of the number of items obtained by transfering large amounts back and forth between mules.
---
Can't believe so many people basically just chased this guy of the subreddit without considering Bethesda *might* just have screwed up once again. Especially after they failed to properly merge branches and then pushed a version of the game that brought back old bugs into production mere weeks ago. 
---
You dont go from such a huge and unmistakable declaration of incompetence to "100% trustworthy code with no chance for mistakes" in such a short timeframe.
---
Don't abuse the report system for irrelevant things. We aren't Bethesda.
---
The fact that bloodied and adrenal had code changes at all is highly suspect. 
---
There are 5 or 6 on the garden and shed at the back of The General's Steakhouse
---
This sounds like speculation. Would suck if its true.
---
Did they stop deleting comments and banning users?
---
Oh sad! Now that they have weight, that's a real chore to collect too.
---
I'm holding it in the base rn, just in case. Maybe I'll just give it away. 
---
dont give them more reason to be lazy just add NPCs ffs
---
&gt; but you know what's worse, pretending nothing is wrong with the game and raising pitchforks and torches for anyone that thinks about criticizing Bethesda or Fallout 76
---
Show me where exactly i said there's nothing wrong with the game. Please. Oh you can't. Because I didn't. 
---
Nor did I even say you can't be critical of the game. I used some very specific examples. 
---
This is about keeping yourself informed about what's going on with the game. That's it. Get it. Do you?
---
I do the same! I built my base to be very high so I can overlook a famous landmark, one I grew up just minutes from. Feels just like home.
---
I know it sounds dumb but on my camp they only workwhen jumping out of the place not in....
---
Though I upgraded past those now...
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying. If you apply the same exact perks to both TS and AA, and factor them in the formula, TS will always come out on top. This is regardless of if you use every AA perk or no AA perks.
---
No. The Lever Action is the Rifleman's gun.
---
Well I don't encounter them very often. Scorchbeasts detect me after shooting them and supermutants detect me at shotgun range most of the time despite having near max possible sneak, the only way I can backstab them is by using a stealthboy. Scorched are completely blind to me except when they are with scorchbeasts.
---
Pretty much tbh, although it's quite hard to do in anything non-bloodied. Especially now with the nerf to explosive.
---
More like full priced Q and A test Alpha.
---
The actual team quit so you're all hired.
---
Pretty sure I could trade for mats to craft 100k rounds of ultracite ammo in 30 days. I have plenty of 2-3* armor that I could trade for caps, convert the caps to flux and other mats, and craft away. Really the only thing that would be hard to acquire would be cloth (for gunpowder), and you can easily get 500ish from a nuked whitesprings run.
---
Also, I could acquire 100k rounds very simply and trip the system by crafting 10k (and I've crafted 10k 50 cal rounds in 3 days before), dropping it, and picking it back up 10 times. I'm doubtful the system can distinguish whether or not I'm acquiring 10k more rounds instead of re-acquiring the same 10k.
---
We haven't seen much effort from Bethesda to fix any problems so I wouldn't be surprised if they fucked up things with this customer as well. If someone has any evidence what Bethesda has done right with FO76 customers I would like to know.
---
My point is, you are interpreting the wording of the ticket, passing your quite possibly false statements as something that the original text says (when it clearly doesn't).
---
I heard someone describe their code as a Jenga tower, they can't pull out one brick without the whole thing wobbling and tipping over.
---
Yeah it's happened to me a lot. Once a whole horde started spawning on top of me when I sniped one from the roof of the prison. They were exploding out of the roof. 
---
I mean, let me be _perfectly clear here_ one out of the "not big deal" things you listed is _literally a fucking crime_. "Wrong bag" thing is, literally, legally, fraud, which is a _fucking crime_. 
---
Leaking personal information is unacceptable. 
---
And the rum is a clear case of false advertisement, which could very well be considered a crime as well. 
---
The games failures as a game are a big fucking deal, and to imply people don't focus on that _all the time_ is completely fucking insane. People talk about the general unprofessional, unfinished product we recieved, and are attacked for it all the time by blithering bethesda fanboys every fucking day. 
---
Can't believe Bethesda is still trying to do these stealth nerfs when their community is fully capable of cracking open their code and seeing all the changes the day after an update.
---
Like, what is the upside for them to do this kind of thing? It's only going to lead to people getting pissed off. I don't run a bloodied build but I do have Adrenal Reaction because it was useful even if you were close to full health and the downside was minimal. Now it's basically useless for me and I'm kind of pissed.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
So youre keen to do 0 dmg against players while they slaughter you :D
---
Shoot your friends? 
---
I agree, but I think the base damage for that multiplier of the 2 shot isn't 125, but rather 100.  Otherwise you're multiplying the 1.25 times 1.25.  Back before it was nerfed, that would have meant 200% \* 200% which would be 4 times the damage, not 2.  Here you are calculating 150% of the damage for the 2 shot over the single shot, and I think that is because the multiplier of the damage should be 100 not 125.
---
Think of it this way: you shooting a second bullet that does 1/4 of the damage of the first one, but in your formula, the first bullet is already doing 125% of the damage of the bullet out of a one shot (which is wrong), THEN you're adding the extra bullet which is also doing 32.25%, not 25%.
---
My conclusion is that the multiplier is based on the damage of a single bullet and that THAT is applied to the 1.25 bullets.
---
Yeah during queen fights or even regular sb fights my goto has always been crouched, ads, tse handmade and i can chew into em. 
---
If this game tracks hate like other mmo's i know im getting its attention since i can get most things to run out of a group of players to come attack me bypassing alot of others damaging it.
---
But yeah, reason i want an aae lever im lazy so hip fire alot. Lol
---
You're doing the lords work. 
---
now you need reading comprehension, I literally said you weren't one of the ones pretending nothing was wrong with the game.
---
as to what your post is about, I don't even think you know, you literally say it's not a post defending Bethesda but then completely defend Bethesda and claim no one read your post...
---
Did not know Strengthened worked too! That's good info, thank you :)
---
Explosive affix has a whole other damage calculation... and if you're talking about SBQ she barely takes any explosive damage at all.
---
Because it makes them money. Yongyea started it and now all the shills are trying to make a few quick bucks.
---
Ahhhh.  You just posted a story about a story about a guy who was banned. How is that different?
---
Like I've done myself and suggested to others, uninstall this incomplete software and come back when and if they ever finish the game.  I'm playing Sea of Thieves and Apex Legends, both complete games, without a thought to this game except for the occasion when I look in r/FO76 for a laugh.
---
\&gt; you can now sell one piece of pre-war money for 35 caps
---
more if you have super duper perk along with your hard bargain, which i do... and that plan... so guess i'm bill frickin' gates now
---
The wasteland has no place for fashion or uniformity!
---
I haven't seen any hard evidence to support this, would you have any information on where I can find this? I've been frustrated about this since I found the dang gun.
---
Everything I've found has been mostly conjecture, and it seems there was a stealth nerf from how it worked in BETA, so older posts aren't relevant.
---
Thank you! This OP forgot to apply multiplier. While he is correct in saying that the *multiplier* is larger for AA, once applied to a TS that has higher base damage, you'll see that TS comes out on top.
---
They're not done yet, thy still need to add non cosmetics to their Atom Store :D
---
I would love to see what they have on me, then. I only have 2 duped weapons I got from friends, less than 50 of nuka cherries and phantom devices, and some how I'm still flagged. I'm well aware of what shenanigans I took a part of, but I've also never physically duped anything myself. Hell, I had less than 1k caps when the ban took place. 
---
It gets more clicks because they deserve it, not because they are being treated unfairly.  They started it, the court of public opinion will see it done.  
---
That's a lot of rifle ammo for a guy who almost exclusively uses shotguns.
---
Level 121 and I've yet to enter a silo
---
It‚Äôs true I mean my god why are these people trolling Reddit looking for stories about fallout? 
---
Why don't the whiners just post to Bethesda's official forums? Why can't reddit be for fun?
---
The amount of players organizing anything is disappointing.
---
Having an official on reddit is a worthless placebo and is the waste of money decision that doesn't add content that we should be complaining about.
---
Our format isn't even easier to read unless you use the old style.
---
Check some of the "did the math" posts in this sub. It's...plausible.  
---
Still unlikely the guy is 100% innocent, and a lot of his side of the story hinges on taking what he's said at face value, so there's that.
---
Why not cross savage divide before 45 tho? I have my camp there near to watoga and do just fine there. Or is there something else that makes it bad to low level guy like me to be there?
---
To be fair, you could go a step further and put quotations around "article" and "news"
---
The guy that had 900 hours spent 9-10 hours per day playing every day. Dude is supposedly off work with an injury. If I won the lottery, I wouldn't consider playing 9-10 hours a day for a game I really love crazy at all. course, he could just be lying.
---
at the armor workbench? if u cant contact beth
---
Nope, I did not forget that. TS ADS is treated as a single projectile, with the exceptions of shotguns and a few others with natural ADS spread.
---
This OP also forgot to apply the multipliers, which made AA seem superior, since he didn't consider that TS has higher base damage.
---
My glow is still gangsta
---
It'll be truly shocking if they are any players left by end of this year :D
---
I did the math in the other thread and by calculation to gain the ultracite ammo alone he needed to make 17 flux and 17 ultracite per hour, EVERY hour he has been playing.
---
He claimed somewhere he made 60 per hour, so even if this is true it means he had to spend 300 hours only crafting ammo, or with perk 150 hours? And thats only the ultracite... regarding all the other ammo and probably what else he had plus leveling phase plus normal mob killing farms ... no way, sorry - I really don't believe him anymore.
---
My unyielding rifleman build remains undetected at the scorchbeast queen fight until there's a rad scorpion or mole rat spawned. Same with my unyielding melee build and I'm able to get sneak attacks with that character consistently. I don't even max out sneak and keep it at level 2.
---
There are certain weapons that are stealth bugged though. I believe the chainsaw and super sledge break stealth, whether they're mod or kept at base config. 
---
I'm going to leave the situation where one projectile hits up to practical testing.
---
However in the case I described where neither projectile hits, there is no damage done.
---
Views views views.
---
76/Bethesda popular opinion is that it sucks, so any story in that vein will be picked up easily by the masses. 
---
You know we aren't Bethesda, right?
---
Haha, I just hit 93 and I was chasing the excavator armor last night around a bunch of 20's. Spent more time trying to control the lvl 50 spawns than completing the miner miracles quest.
---
fully depleted hunger https://imgur.com/gallery/6vRGnxJ
---
I'm REALLY hoping these are still works in progress that someone accidentally patched in with the latest build, because while the War and Black sets look fucking awesome the Plague and Pale sets look like crappy recolors with junk glued to them.
---
Thank fuck those poor, financially-incompetent fools have you looking out for them. I shudder to think what might happen to them if they could make decisions on their own.
---
Are you guys getting the +Damage showing up in PipBoy Effects?  Mine's gone and then I cleared off all of the mutations and haven't taken a Rad bath to see if I can get it back.
---
Pc gaming is on life support. The steam machines didn‚Äôt work out and almost everything the comes out on PC comes out on console. In fact more games don‚Äôt come out on PC anymore or are long delayed when they do like red dead 2. They should just get an Xbox one x.
---
We also need a "look in the bag ya n00b!" emote. 
---
It's not an either/or. 
---
It was pretty hard to find 5 pieces that had 2 \* 50% fall damage, chameleon, regeneration and stealth.
---
It was worth it though.  Unless the stealth bug is in effect, I can move crouched right past any enemy except dogs.  Yes, even a landed scorch beast.  I regularly go to fissure sites and mine all the decaying ultra cite veins.  I just ignore the scorched and scorch beasts wandering around.  I have ALL the stealth perks and an adjusted agility of 22 and an adjusted perception of 20.
---
you link to their reddit accounts, what's wrong with linking to their [News](https://bethesda.net/en/news) page where every Inside the Vault article can be found?
---
p.s.  learn how to embed links...
---
What, you don't love the awkward waiting to see if they're interested in anything while they're awkwardly waiting to see if you're interested in anything, so you both kinda just stand there with your thumbs up your ass for two minutes?
---
That‚Äôs a good question. Maybe some do. But i think for the most part it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs no reward system like karma. Plus they can‚Äôt be total dicks there. 
---
Which is what i think a lot enjoy. The like upsetting people. But they also can‚Äôt handle being called out.
---
Hi, I'm the OP of the original thread! When ADS, with the exception of shotguns and a few other weapons with natural ADS spread, TS is always counted as a single 125% projectile.
---
Don't forget the obligatory "I've played a bagillion hours and am quitting now, here's 4 paragraphs about why everyone here should give a shit".
---
I know two shot ones exist. Found one on a mole miner supervisor last night, actually. 
---
Hahahaha look at the comments on the article.
---
&gt;Who the hell has 2 accounts? They didnt say 2 separate characters. They said two Accounts. No logical reason to own 2 separate accounts. Characters sure. But a secondary account. This dude probably found an exploit that only he knows and they couldn't figure out how he did it. and eventually figured it out via an investigation and oh hey guess what. Hes still banned. You literally cant trust anyone nowadays.
---
This guy has to be a troll, no way someone can be that stupid.
---
Yet your casting blame for the sake of casting blame? How do you not see the flawed logic 
---
My best bet, you run a baby rage build? If so, Adrenal Reaction is currently bugged from what I have read. I noticed the same, I run a babyrage heavy gunner, and the lvl 62 charred ghouls did about half my hp with their lunge attacks. 
---
Depending on modders to find a way to fix stuff for them...
---
Or trying to rush out private servers/mods so folks fix bugs w/ the do it yourself kit. (or fix it yourself kit)
---
The 0 on the forehead with the 1 on the nose was a limited release for 800 atoms if I recall correctly. 
---
What is that based on? How do you know it is counted as a single projectile?
---
How about a "Items I am willing to trade" tab instead. That way you can move all your stuff into that tab, and have it be the ONLY things that appear in trade interactions. Would allow for more "character" to be injected into transactions, too.
---
Honestly, it is nothing terribly special.  Most of it is BOS combat armor with varying effects.  Only the chest is unyielding.  One leg is trapper and I believe one arm is leather.
---
Wishful thinking, I guess. PCGamer isn't exactly some random tech blog.
---
The article was made well before the game released. It doesnt have a date, but theres a note in there about someone confirming mothman stuff would be in the game.
---
If I was in the area I'd make an attempt at my own album like this with my favorite spots.
---
Nope, if you want, you can have my bethesda account for 10 dollars (with only fallout 76 on it) i bought the game and ended up not liking it
---
Data minded doesn't mean it's officially coming out. 
---
Still shit after several months.
---
Theres your quick status.
---
So, what you're saying is you want no one to post here ever, unless it's content you fully believe in. You honestly fucking believe that if we don't talk about issues _publicly_ Bethesda, with it's \_shitty\_ fucking track record will address them? Mmhm.  
---
Implying your post only references "I got banned" posts is...amusing, and I'll leave it there.   
---
And if you can't handle one "fucking" you're not mature enough to survive on the fucking internet, dude.  You're trying to enforce your personal views on what is and is not acceptable to post, which is far more offensive to _me_ than some profanity.   
---
If you don't like the content of a post, don't click on it. If you don't like profanity, don't interact with people who use it. If you don't think a forum that is _frequently, often primarily_ used to communicate with _other users_ about issues and bugs and work arounds. _don't fucking post here_.   
---
This isn't a ultimatum. This is life advice. You don't like the content, you shouldn't force yourself to read it.   You sure as hell shouldn't force people to read about your petty dislike of conversations about the game. 
---
But this post takes you from someone who doesn't want to read about bugs to a hypocritical asshole. "I'm going to make a post not related to the game to try to censor what conversations about the game are made".   
---
This post belongs on this reddit less than _any_ post on _any_ subject directly related to fallout 76.

Less than awesome? It's fucking *amazing.* I have never laughed as hard as when I found him halfway to the goddamn ranger station, still chasing monsters.

yep it was really cool. just lose line of sight with anything then crouch and your hidden. exactly what the description says. bugged now though, so is the running part
---
No matter the damage or damage resist, TS comes out better. You can test it yourself with the equation.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that sort is totally broken. I mean logically it would sort the food closest to spoiling at the top, so you can eat it before it spoils. Instead we get basically all food items mixed together with most spoiled near the bottom, but a bunch of other items after it.  
---
I know that probably half the food I cook ends up rotting. Given you have to eat every 15-20 minutes or whatever, I tend to just grab the first food item I find in the list instead of doing O(n) searches every time to find the most spoiled thing. (though I do that sometimes anyway)

FO4 and NV are like this, too. Possibly all of them but those two I know for sure. It's cool driving to Vegas and seeing shit from the game.

my wife and I and another couple we know all play together. We have strategically place all four camps on the map to save travel costs as we can fast travel to each others camps.

When our kids all jump on with us it makes me wish the teams could be bigger.

I have all three rifleman perks maxed as well as tank killer and crit perks. My Anti-Armor Gauss did no where near the same damage as my Exterminator's Lever Action. I unfortunately ended up selling the Gauss and switching. 
---
I use to be pc gamer but now I don‚Äôt have to. Plus the communities are toxic and all the online games have Exploits. 
---
True, but I just feel like the quality of journalism of all types has been on a downward slope for a while now. It's hard to find unbiased writing from journalists that aren't just trying to hit as many buzzwords as possible.
---
I don't have a TSE rifle. I and my 2* Furious Lever Action laugh in your general direction...
---
Yup, Bloodied Handmade is the same, crap damage.  Figures, I just started using Mutations the day before Nert Patch 6.  Just got the -50 HP and every single weapon has lost that +Damage.
---
Hmmm...what if they're also nerfing Bloodied and everything else is fookered along that journey.

Now put a sock in it.
---
You are replying to a post that was asking when they were going to fix the bug....
---
This place, the top floor of the house has one.  If it's hacked you can server hop or fast travel to Ellie's Bunker in the Mire, it also has one to open the door.
---
I would pay real money for these, even more so if I can use it on all PA types.
---
I find it confusing of what they consider rare items. Like is 5mm ammo rare? For me if i want to take on the queen with my friends i would use my TS mini gun and make sure i had 5k or more 5mm. If i did this every day for 20 days thats 100k. Am I banned for that now?  
---
And even through i dont do farming most of my friends do. To make 5k round you need 1500 steel, 750 lead and 400 gunpowder. If you're grinding for 10-12 hours a day thats not impossible to get.  So if you scale it back and say 100K round in 30 days thats 1020 steel, 510 lead, and 272 gunpoweder a day. Totally do-able in a 10-12 hour grind. Might need your mom or a good friend to take care of the shit bucket though. (Anybody? Shit bucket?)
---
When you plug in any damage value against the Queen's 300 resist, TS will always come out on top.
---
I only recently started watching the show, and it is amazing. I remembered the bar in Fallout 4, though, and I'm glad I started watching the show. Every now and then I catch a reference to the area that I know from Fallout 4.
---
That's not a fix.
---
Probably just had a slow run. Nukes were firing left right and center for over the weekend. 
---
Run by a team that knows how to fix bugs.
---
Cant begin to imagine how they thought a team that lets modders fix their games is gonna be able to run an online game. Morons.
---
The same team that expect players to download bug fixes from 3rd party sites. No wonder they were livid when PSN refused mods.
---
It should
---
I‚Äôve noticed this too. Also after the ban wave...guess some people just don‚Äôt want to shoot down the cargo bots and would rather dupe the cards. 
---
"Also, I play like a massive gigantic, not very nice person. I play like a raider, most times. I run up and destroy your base then try to murder you cause I am bored and I want to"
---
Dude, you're a griefer. What you described is text book toxic griefer asshole behavior. 
---
This game is the first fallout game with online aspects. Catering to evil, toxic assholes like you is a major mistake I hope they address in future titles. I honestly don't know what's wrong with you, but get fucking help. 
---
It's super easy to find them.
---
That's your shortsightedness, then. Hundreds of changes have been made to the game on behest of this sub.
---
Also, a majority of banned accounts were proved to have carried a large number of duped items at some point.Either they crafted these items of picked up items crafted by other dupers. It is very unlikely that 900 hr guy is glowing exception, especially someone who has played the game for this long. Bethesda has produced evidence that there has been duping, now it's this guy's burden to prove his innocence,
---
If you‚Äôre level 50+ he attacks you if you engage first
---
Thanks a million!
---
I might have to pick them up now, that billboard is massive 
---
Yeah doesn't seem plausible for someone to play Fallout 76 - of all games - 10 hours a day. Like there's gotta be paint drying somewhere he could observe instead.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good point guess I‚Äôm over complicating it, thanks for the discussion!
---
ahh, nice, did you document any of this? I don't have any mates who still play at the moment lol
---
I played very little in Patch 5 due to the stuff they messed up that was already fixed. I was looking forward to getting back in on Patch 6 with the increased stash and dialed back Beasts... but now I am not sure I want to. These Stealth Nerfs need to stop. 
---
Have they **buffed** a single thing since BETA? Seriously. All they want to do is nerf things left and right!
---
His math is wrong. He's comparing the *multipliers* of TS and AA, which AA *does in fact have a higher number for.* However, once you apply the multipliers to their respective base damages, you'll that the TS' +25% makes it come out on top.
---
Sorry I was being lazy and my comment didnt seem as jerkish when I first read it, now it does.
---
Hope you can solve your issues and get back out there. You probably tried doing the file verfication thing too?
---
Can't be better than m+kb, and someone with a controller will always be beaten in a shooter by someone with m+kb at equal skill levels, no doubt.Why gimp yourself ? 
---
^This, it‚Äôs a different world 
---
Right, so for what we do know, does any here know if the forehead paint was limited and released already? I was out for a week and don't know if I missed it.
---
Only, that's not fucking true, because you needed _different costumes_ for the affect to work. 
---
I just thought it was noteworthy that outside sources apparently care what happens on this sub.
---
So basically with AA and perferating magazine, you don't need tank killer or at least only one point
---
I see it when the server or connection is in bad shape, i.e. slow loading of kill loot, delayed notification of plant picking, etc...  Typically it's indicator for us to hop servers before we each start crashing out.
---
That's the primary argument for having multiple tabs, or some kind of sub-category sorting. If items provide multiple effect (and a whole lot of them do) they should show up in any applicable tab or whatever group.  
---
On the other hand, logical sorting would go a hell of a long way to fixing the problem if they don't want to do it right. Having a sane naming convention for items would work fine, but I've heard that there's already an internal tag for item type that would accomplish the same thing.   
---
Given that, and that they partially implemented type naming for plans and recipes, It's actually baffling how badly they've handled it for everything else. 
---
If you go through and read some terminals and notes in Harper's Ferry, there's references to Vault 94, a GECK and the Free Staters being visited by at least one vault dweller from 94.  I'm guessing Babylon is a reference to upcoming content related to Vault 94.
---
Damn :/
---
I looked in the command center for the keyword and I don't see anything yet. How are the nuke codes solved already without the keyword?
---
Wait a minute you mean just by clicking on a bag on the ground and taking stuff you can be banned? Hell I've had my ass curbed stomped by some mutants and just didn't go back for my little "skull &amp; crossbones" marked bagged. Didn't want a beat-down again. But I'm guessing someone could have come along and found my bag that I never came back for and got...Oh who the hell know some gears, screws maybe 20 aluminum or whatever the hell else I may have had on me. But your saying that action by me could get someone banned because they picked up my bag? Again something I left on my own? If
---
If I'm understanding things correctly, and I hope I'm not, that's F'n stupid by Bethesda. I've also click on a back or two I found dropped, nothing fancy. Some spoiled food, a bit of ammo...maybe a Nuka-Cola and some cheap ass armor and or weapon. Are you all saying that could have got me banned?
---
But they cant cause they have no idea what they doing especially w/ a engine not designed for online play.
---
Refuses new engine, brute forces ancient one for online play. Copy paste data and bugs from previous games.
---
Reminds me of them images made of text being copy pasted from one website to another, it never looks the same. Its all messed up.
---
Thats this game in nutshell.
---
I don't really understand why Yong and this guy made these videos weeks later. Like it's old news. I have mixed views on microtransactions. I've played "Pay to win" Korean MMOs. I spent money on cosmetics and inventory space and stuff. But at the top level you have to spend like thousands on such twisted designs where your weapon breaks when trying to upgrade it, and it costs real money to upgrade it, etc. No way will I spend money on that BS. As for 15 health being "pay to win". Well atoms are pretty easy to get in game and it was a temporary buff. A good build will still one shot you. I don't see the big deal about it realy.
---
Nope, TS is better.
---
This OP simply found the *multipliers*, and didn't apply them to their respective base damages. The AA multiplier is in fact better than TS, but when applying to to base dmg, TS' +25% makes it come out on top.
---
A saxophone is just a jazzy clarinet.
---
I think you're both wrong.  I think the multiplier is based on a single bullet.  It is a multiplier after all.  If you added in the bonus to the multiplier as well as the damage, you get a higher 156% for the "I'm calculating the bullets together" or a low 115% for the "I'm calculating the bullets separately".
---
My reasoning is that the first bullet isn't magically hitting any harder, there are just more of them (1 and 1/4).  Likewise, that 2nd 1/4 size bullet isn't magically weaker (15%), it's 25%.
---
Still, AA is slightly stronger than 2 shot, but they're pretty close in most cases.
---
This is my rifle, which is a gun.

Before the last two patches, using it was fun.

I started as an unarmed, but the queen she was unharmed.

I swapped all my perks, got nerfed, now I'm done.

Has the data been mined since November?

I didnt watch the video because yongyee is a clickbait scumbag YouTuber who feeds off fake drama, but going off the thumbnail, hes complaining now about an event that happened in game 2? weeks ago
---
How desperate can he get?
---
No, I do not.
---
Yeah
---
Casting blame on who?
---
Bethesda says they have evidence of illicit activity and banned those accounts?
---
Who am I blaming?
---
Dang wish you were on xbox
---
I know, I mean I love the mainline TES and Fallout games, but I only play them with the unofficial patchs, I, we all, gave Beth a pass on those games because they were otherwise great titles and single player, where bugs don't matter much...
---
Dunno, flare gun is a comically bad (if fun) "weapon" as well.  Like shooting flaming snowballs...
---
  ;)
---
That's pretty encouraging.....pretty sure I could put together a reasonable set from what I have in storage.
---
By what possible stretch of the imagination is crafting items via a rare recipe included in the game an exploit?
---
That explains a lot, thank you. 
---
I use an instigating sledge with +40% power attack, so my next question is this; if instigating is that 40% power attack also doubled on first strike?
---
Doesn't it only work with the metal armor?
---
Take it up with them then.
---
I don't care to hear whatever you are or aren't making up.
---
I encountered an infinite loading screen when fast travelling from my camp to Whitesrings.
---
Agreed. And clone our characters to it so we can test a copy of our existing characters without messing up the originals.
---
But the problem is he says he moved it around from alt to his main multiple times. BSG has admitted that they can't tell where you get items from or if the items are unique. Which means they could be counting his ammo stash multiple times for however many times he swapped it from one character to another.
---
When you making bank off 100s of people paying $5 or more for items it quickly adds up and honestly makes 900 hours not seem enough. I could be wrong though he could be innocent but those little transactions do add up. Im sure people made a lot of money duping and selling and probably have an alternate account to play legit on
---
No offense me deadpelicanguy but if I want to quest in the forest all day then that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do, given I‚Äôm not gonna ruin some new players experience on purpose.. they do need to realize that it‚Äôs a shared world imo. 
---
Plus I‚Äôd still rather have an assasins sentinel +1 strength piece that‚Äôs lvl 40 than a lvl 50 1star, I just think it‚Äôs a little pretentious to be telling people where they should and should not play tbh, but hey that‚Äôs just me! Have a good one!
---
Need to push those daily unique views.
---
I know it would be a lot of work for them to implement, but I'd love for them to make a "nuked version" of the map, so wherever someone nuked it would actually change the environment on that server until the server reset.  Even after the actual nuke event disappears, the environment appears burned and damaged etc.
---
If all of the Ultracite ammo was .45 or similar, yes he'd have to make \~20 flux/hr during his claimed 12 hours per day. However, if he made Ultracite 5mm, his flux rate would only have to be \~5/hr, or \~60/day, which is definitely achievable in a few hours without tremendous optimization of effort.

Here are a number of threads about two-shot in Fallout 4:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/477aub/25\_more\_damage\_vs\_two\_shot\_damage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/477aub/25_more_damage_vs_two_shot_damage/)

---
One explanation:  
---
"The two-shot variant of the weapon takes the base weapon damage *with mods*, and adds the base damage *without* mods in the paper damage (listed damage). When firing, this damage value is halved, and each projectile deals half of the total damage. ***If both bullets hit one target, it only uses damage reduction once - treating both projectiles as a single shot, meaning it's better at penetrating armor.***"  
---
So it appears to only treat it as a single projectile if they both hit and the 125% damage is only without mods.
---
According to the article the Ammo numbers in the Bethesda notification are disputed by the 900 Hours Guy, who claims that he can't verify the real figures due to the ban. Though that begs the question of why they would be inaccurate, or whose Ammo counts Bethesda listed instead of his.
---
So, stash box full, go dump all extras into vending machine, fill up stash again.  How is this not increasing in world items?  
---
Next, what happens when they leave the server with unsold items?  This is where duping comes from.  
---
Inside CAMP vending machines, that move with you when you leave, which share limit with your stash might work.
---
Yeah, this game sure has alot of console players :)
---
As someone who specifically set out to explore the real world locations that inspired the in game sites, I can say I was NOT disappointed.   Hill Billy Hotdogs should have recieved a lot more love in game.  The real world location is an experience in and of itself.  Mothman Museum?  Greenbrier (Whitespring)?  Any number of other locations were absolutely worth the trip and I plan to do it again, even if I'm not a huge fan of how the game turned out.  If you're thinking of doing it, then do it!  We had an amazing time. 
---
Yesterday was around 4GB. So I'd say no.
---
Firstly, not everyone that can't or won't spend extra money on a video game is financially incompetant. Secondly, I'm not making decisions for them. You're coming off like a real asshole. There was no need for your remarks. 
---
They went into this without a strategy outside of marketing the game.. poorly
---
Articles about it are being translated in Italian as well.
---
Do it. They rather roast over a fire w/ flaming sharks jumping out of it being drawn to their bleeding corpses, then give you a refund.
---
This is the perfect reason for charge back. Jus assume they shall ban you which shall be the most uplifting thing they shall do for you.
---
You may be able to get back in if you repay them when ready to return...Dont see you returning.
---
I think you may be overestimating how hard it is to farm ultracite. Besides glass caverns, there are many fissure sites and, with the right equipment you can easily farm the SB. Not to mention buying it from other players. Bottom line, I don't have a horse in this race. But it bothers me how you're upset with people defending him, saying Bethesda is the one who will decide his guilt or innocence, yet you are vehemently trying to convince everyone he's a liar. 
---
Hell yes those are awesome.
---
Still want a pink or rainbow one.
---
Is there less cheating on Consoles?
---
Tyvm !

Or just be able to flag "tradeable" items in your inventory that show up automatically, and ONLY TRADEABLE ITEMS. WTF do I have to scroll through someone elses entire inventory, or let them do so to mine?
---
Our ISP doesn‚Äôt have retentions = / so we get screwed all the time.
---
That's essentially what I'm getting at. I don't trade often, and if I do I'm usually giving away great items I found to my clan mates that fit their build, or items that are just taking up my stash. As far as that goes, I've come across plenty of bags with mutation serums just chilling there. I've also transferred stuff from my mule, be which is on the same account. I also farm my own magazines and bobbleheads, meanwhile I'm still hit with the hammer. 
---
So he was actually a clever businessman?

Go figure.

Trick for cobalt is pumpkin farm.  Is a small crop just west of it that has ~40 plants.  Get enough cobalt Flux for ~10 stable in a couple minutes of harvesting (assuming super super and the plant picker perk).  Pretty much poop for non Flux drops though.

Well, I didnt know there was a quest for the excavator. I found a suit very early on in the lucky hole mine. And when I found the quest and explored garrahan mining hq, I hit the scan button b4 I built the armor and it completed the quest. I didnt cheat. So, please dont just assume someone automatically did.

Sorry I think I had my recipes mixed up, I meant to say black berry crisp which uses sugar bombs and and royal jelly.. it gives a massive AP boost. But I believe there are brain bombs which use sugar bombs and brain fungus. I‚Äôm trying to get into some more advanced recipes, sorry for the confusion. Ty for the info

Neither he nor the BGS message he posted claimed he actually had 140k + 225K Ultracite ammo spread across two accounts. What BGS said was his accounts ‚Äúacquired‚Äù those amounts (plus other generic ammo) ‚Äúover 30 days of game play.‚Äù What the banned guy said was he‚Äôd crafted a lot of Ultracite ammo, but nowhere near that much, then moved it around between characters and accounts.
---
His theory is ‚Äúacquired‚Äù was/is tracked as any time an item is added to an account‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs the same ammo you just dropped 5 seconds ago, then picked back up. He may be full of shit and a duper, but BGS hasn‚Äôt said it yet. 
---
All they need to do is say those ammo amounts were in his inventory at any one time, or, that all his Ultracite ammo was 365k different rounds. Either one would prove him a liar...kinda weird they picked such vague language.

It's ok. Venting your spleen on FO76 is free therapy. And, unlike sending it to Beth, you'll actually get responses here.

That's something I can't confirm or deny, I don't know if Fallout let's you stack anti-armor perks/mods or if it just takes the highest value. There could be a diminishing return that we don't know about. I just know what I said as far as the actual damage calculation... no idea if they let you stack those things.

Gotcha

Just have it roll this.

They have a week to either fix reported bugs or pull it from patch.

Except the spoil sort doesn't sort very well at all. You want to give priority to the most spoiled food, so it should be right at the top. But they don't do that, and they don't put it at the far end of the list either. Instead you have to scroll down like 2/3 or 3/4 through your whole list till you find the right section, basically scanning the food condition for everything. 
---
Not even close.

I would have to ask my friend if we both get on tonight. I gave it to him since I don‚Äôt really use heavy weapons.

Outside of people saying they are role playing "raiders" it's not really a thing.

Nice bait.
---
Where mistakes?
---
If everything else you craft in the game gives you 1 cap, and this gives you 25, that's obviously not intended behavior. Using something that is not working as intended to give you an advantage is the actual definition of an exploit. 
---
You gotta understand most of these players are lying and do they have this publicly available if not I wouldn't post it for supers to spam call them  and they end up banning Noone the servers have been a lot more reliable after the ban wave even with nukes. They are trying to help but the community belives every fake post...

Damn it Bethesda shut up and take my money

Did you notice your vamp weapon healing you?
---
Do you have the healing mutation?
---
Were you stuck in caution?
---
Tried exiting and re entering the PA? This seemed to work for me in the past if I felt extra squishy for some reason.
---
Hopefully this gets fixed. Happy they made the helmet separate from the suit now!
---
Tax Refund Bay-Bee!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
And it isn't WhitespringS, there is no s at the end.
---
You can, but I wanted to save a quest...
---
That‚Äôs one way to look at it.
---
That would count, thanks!
---
How would you solve when a teammate leave the team and joins a new team? Can they now start building in that general vicinity? 
---
I think scorchebeasts and deathclaws playing not with m+kb. 
---
&gt;The highlight vision bleeds onto nearby players (sometimes teammates who are far away) and causes stability drops and crashes
---
I read that as the outline itself bleeding. 
---
&gt;Highly unlickly or not is not the point it's possible and actually more likly than not with things like shadowplay or OBS or streaming. His statement was and I quote " There will never be a way to prove you didn't do something" There are almost always a ways to prove you did or did not do something.  Just Like When I game I usually have my shadowplay running and recording. I record the entire time I am on the game. I then later after I an done recording I will go through and get rid of the footage I don;t want or can't use or place it in a external harddrive for later use in a video. That  is how I proved I was not the person that was doing what I was accused of and got unbanned becasue I was able to "Prove" I did not do it.  
---
Can you send a link of the latest version? Would love to see the latest camp items!
---
Oh yeah. Makes sense üßê
---
They're both awesome towns.  Fayetteville might get the nod because it has the original Pies &amp; Pints, but Lewisburg is a cool little town, too.  
---
(their)
---
As I said, I went back and checked, and there are other like that in the base game and in use since the first open beta. Nothing special about them, except the strange naming
---
I think part of the issue with reporting this is issue and getting others to realize the issue, is if people don't sneak all the time and aren't fully aware of how enemies reacted in different location and distance  to stealth prior to Patch 5, people try sneaking and go "Oh look I'm hidden I got a stealth bonus kill, sneak works fine.". I sneak like 90% of the time and I can tell you that post patch 5, there is a big difference to enemy detection of Stealth. This isn't an insult to anyone, the randomness of the bugs are annoying because you have to go "trust me it's broken", because you can't have people go back in time and sneak in pre-Patch 5 and then sneak in post Patch 5.
---
I actually think it's multiple issues, not just a single issue. One issue is the it seems like enemies seemingly randomly detect you at distances in the past that would never happen. Another issues is you can become stuck detected when there is nothing around to detect you. This is annoying because then your loosing your bonus damage. Normally logging in and out will correct this.
---
Anyway it's annoying and I feel this probably won't be corrected for a long time, due to the nature of the bug. 
---
I'm lvl 90 and haven't finished.  I haven't completed many side quests either.  Waiting to finish quests after or on lvl 50 lets you get maxed leveled weapons when they are a part of the reward for the quest.  Waiting has its benefits.
---
Sorry
---
Humor can be subjective, and I misread your intentions.
---
You‚Äôre going to have make the awkward decisions for yourself.
---
1) stay banned indefinitely waiting for a definitive answer or resolution.
---
2) spend the money and time to create a new toon and start all over.
---
If you choose #2,
---
You‚Äôre gonna have to buy another pc and software copy, install it on a pc other then current, and associate it a different email, hopefully not banned, and use a different payment card.
---
You could save a some money, by 
---
1) buy a new copy of windows and install *risky
---
2) install a new nic if you‚Äôre reusing old pc
---
3) clean install of Fallout 76.
---
The IT guy in me still likes to find ways to do this cheaply.
---
Fwiw, I think the ZeniMax client ties back to the .ini or config file.
---
I think during the install it pulls the MAC address, host names and windows registry keys.
---
Apps used to be associated w/registry keys not sure anymore.
---
Disclaimer I am not encouraging you to bypass their security protocols.
---
I am not Bethesda and or affiliated w/them.
---
I suspect Your banned account was associated with the previous information 
---
What you‚Äôre doing is,  buying and installing a new copy and starting from scratch
---
No hate and good luck.
---
lmao. Fuck off. You dupe, you get banned. tough shit.
---
1 day account pass 
---
Got ya. Yes it's a bug. Been around got a while. The bug also causes big stability issues and a lot of crashes. 
---
I think I am atm! But my marsupial makes my INT-4.. Not sure if that has anything to do with it. PS gonna pm you for tips if you don't mind! 
---
dodgy definitely makes a huge difference, even in PA.
---
Several craftable items--the rest of the helmets and headwear, for example--are very profitable. The selling price is set by the developers, not accessed by using a glitch or combining various factors in a way that allow for unintended synergy.  This combination of factors does not suggest to me that anything here is failing to work as intended.
---
You make a good point. The more I think about it, it looks like all active players should actually be paid by Bethesda, since we're the ones conducting regression testing for them.
---
I hope your mom and dad admits their mistake.
---
There‚Äôs one place kind of like this by the ammunition‚Äôs factory but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs marked so I‚Äôd have to go explore and find it again, I‚Äôll lyk but I‚Äôm sure someone knows exactly what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Wouldn't it be wiser to have a CAMP in the north and south to better utilize the free fast travel? To add, camps can be built together so if you wanna add flair to her CAMP, you can. Prob should ask permission tho.
---
I guess we'll never know.
---
just use a melee weapon tbh lmao. It seems like they're never going to get tuned-down. Came back after 4-5 months of not playing and I can still one or two shot most things
---
&gt; It's just as easy to collect comments and bug reports from live.
---
I don't think easing data collection should be the priority. If it were, we would have had an actual way to submit bug reports within the game client since beta.
---
Right now Bethesda's priority should be providing some veneer of competence following the consistent string of failures.
---
Ah, nothing too interesting I guess then?
---
PC gamer and "gaming journalists" have been taking front page reddit drama as a creditable source for ages now. Nothing new here besides clickbait.
---
I also am curious which plan/recipe they‚Äôre talking about.
---
"Why The Face?"
---
Scrolling through someone's inventory doesn't take that long.
---
She‚Äôs not
---
brute force normally, when they get a letter they run it through the program and get it narrowed down to about 1-200 options.  then there's a few crews that just spam try options until they succeed 
---
I'm thankful that Bethesda is finally being held accountable for forcing people to break the TOS, and cheat/dupe/exploit. 
---
Those bastards try to make me duplicate 100,000+ Ultracite ammo everytime I log in. I have to drop 9000 TSE shot guns and 1,500,000 ammo every day, just so I can walk out my front door! 
---
It's ridiculous!
---
"gaming media is essentially high school gossip"
---
Yep- gaming 'journalism' is one of the wackiest terms ever created.  
---
Nope 
---
There's one on the top floor of the Agriculture building in Flatwoods.
---
I'm not saying I personally think the guy was innocent, I'm just saying that however unlikely, his story is plausible. In criminal law that's reasonable doubt. Continuing to play this out as if it were a criminal case, I think to actually convince a jury he would have to reinforce his own story (proof he had played that much, server logs etc) and also answer some of the "why" questions you bring up. Because regular people are all going to wonder about that.
---
Tried to message you but it's not popping up for some reason.. can you DM me? 
---
one step forward, two steps back.
---
Damn, those are NICE.
---
What exactly are they suing for? 
---
That is what one of my buddies said. None of his other people play it anymore. Mine Either actually. I'm sticking with it. I really enjoy this game. Just not some of the player aspects of it. 
---
Welp, found the new meta. 
---
In the middle of big bend tunnel there‚Äôs one 
---
That‚Äôs so fucking awesome this is what will get people to buy atom shop items, good start with Mothman items too
---
Sorry, they did say that.    
---
My point stands that it's still adding inventory to the world, so I came up with a workaround tying it to the stash limit.    
---
Discussion and shade are tough to separate these days.
---
Those Cargo bots move fast tho and the load times are so long.
---
While the post that OP linked is from november, it seems that the guy who posted it has kept the imgur albums up to date. The unstoppables items were datamined last month for example.
---
Though [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asralt/post_patch_6_new_pa_skins_data_mined/) might interest you. Datamined today.
---
Yes it is.  There are limitations to what can be corrected retroactively.  Hence why when downloading updates for a game, PC or Console you often have to restart the game or system to allow the updates to be applied.
---
Yeah, I feel like there is always a cargobot within earshot.
---
I'm not trying to convince anything. I already saw an article about how Bethesda banned him unfairly. The consensus made there mind up regardless. The whole point of this post was to get people to adopt some skepticism when dealing with people who have been banned. The 900 hours guys story has plausibility but also some red flags. Despite that, the whole story of Bethesda banning dupers has fallen on deaf ear and the only thing people want to talk about is how 1 guy out of who knows how many may have been banned unfairly and how shitty Bethesda are for doing that. 
---
*I will readily admit to being pissed when TSEs were nerfed, being a Stealth/Sniper Build, it had a very significant affect on my character, and in my opinion only happened because of the Duping of TSEs, and the Whining from Melee Players.*
---
That said, I adjusted, 12 levels of new perks &amp; shifting a few points, and now my Still Stealth/Killer character is a very viable build for any occasion.
---
Primary Weapons include (in order of most used)
---
Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet (Death Tambo backup), TSE Handmade, Exp. Combat Shotgun, Furious Machete (For when i'm in PA), Mutant's Explosive Hunting Rifle (for the long Shots), &amp; a Furious Explosive Gatling gun (for SBQ battles only).
---
Besides the nerf to TSEs, the bigger issue has been weapon durability, TSEs that previously lasted days without repairs now can't get through one good battle without breaking, and no amount of perk adjustments seem to be helping this (Luck of the Draw no longer works as it did before).
---
What truly bothers me the most is how unbalanced things are with reality, My DC gauntlet does over 1200 damage, but my TSE Handmade is under 200, and people are running around with hammers doing over 2000.
---
The Melee players Cry babied about TSEs, till they were nerfed, then started crying about the SBQ not landing enough for them to beat it to death with their 1 viable weapon they carry, now that's fixed.
---
Waiting to see what they whine about next, how about Whaaaa! the rifleman killed me before I got close enough to one shot him with my big hammer.
---
You're awesome. Thank Archy. 
---
Rad worms bug?
---
It was introduced in patch 5, getting rad worms would visually buff and nerf random stats, perks, and even mods. It made carry weights fluctuate like mad, sometimes you could sprint but not fast travel and vice versa.
---
When rad worms was cured/removed it effected some mutations like Marsupial, and buffed / nerfed more random stats, perks, and mods.
---
Basically it just made a rotating mess of your character.
---
Fixed now, at the cost of breaking adrenal reaction and possibly strange in numbers.
---
Ack, thought they said they fixed those
---
I literally left all my chems at my stash with the new 200lb Stash increase. At least now i don‚Äôt need the walking pharmacy perk. 
---
It‚Äôs not just the nuke zone.  I was farming ghouls and critters at WS and some 80 lvl player one shots me and takes my loot.  I respawn and make quick work of him or her, but before I can retrieve by loot then their buddy (who must have been lurking) comes in and one shots me again.  I come right back and they had both bailed with the loot.  
---
I do think there are players that wait in the weeds because it‚Äôs a lot easier to collect loot from someone else doing the dirty work, but what pisses me off is when they quickly run off after stirring up the shitstorm.   Lame! 
---
my wallet is waiting....
---
The price for my eggs dropped down to 9 from 20. Perks didn't change I thought it was nerfed.
---
The game launched with always-on voice comms, I don't think protecting your ears from vulgarity was at any time Bethesda's goal.
---
In fact, the only difference between a holotape and someone running circles around you shouting obscenities is that the holotape is actually recorded evidence you could use to report them.
---
Yuppers, know and reported but might have forgotten to add it on this list, thanks for the reminder!
---
Ah makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. It would explain a lot of my crashes during SBQ.
---
In addition to being a skilled chef, Delbert Winters was also a graphic designer and amateur cartographer. He left those maps all over Appalachia.
---
Just list it for a stupid amount of money.
---
Yeah you can have that shotgun. 25k caps.
---
Ok, this is amazing. 
---
It‚Äôs everywhere ? Find it all over.
---
You think, it's a start, but think harder.
---
Are you comparing the same day in the week?
---
That seems to be an odd bug that effects players sometimes. 
---
I had it once, had to server hop because every where j went the NPCs spawned dead or I could hear them and they died when I closed to sight range
---
for ranged (pvp and pve wise) bloodied or anti armor anything goes.
---
if your dirt poor and want something with damage and cheap . tse weapons.. they go about 1000 caps
---
That wasn't really the point. I don't care how many mole rat chunks you have, or if you're carrying 200 clownsuits. I don't need to see it.
---
I only need to see what we're trading. I also don't need you looking through my inventory, and trying to make offers on something I'm not going to trade.
---
You got it bud.
---
from everything I've read it's 3 points in the perk animal friend and you get a tame option with a gun when encountering a solo pet in a random spawn. must be solo, not event or anything like that. I have tried and in every YouTube  video when I check out the spots they commend there is never a solo spawning creature. I end up giving up for frustration and time reason but one day .... ONE DAY. rawr.
---
(no wendigo tame option I know of but would be cool!!! i have a tree house in my camps backyard I'm working on that would be perfect for him!)
---
It shows up under a store reference so I would guess its going to be atom store and not in game.
---
Lots of people who respec multiple times. He is level 450 and that means he could have respecced nearly 10 times (if you count a full build to be level 50).
---
Do not take this as a disbelief of your findings. I just trying to pinpoint what is going on. I went through the code again and could not find an obvious correlation between Adrenal Reaction and hunger/thirst. Does the same effect shows on all your weapons or only the "bloodied" one?
---
I just ran a whitesprings nuke and came across an AA .44.  I had a 2-shot .44 and was actually curious, so I did a non-scientific test.  I set the 2-shot to hotkey 4 and the AA to hotkey 5.  (PC player)  I went to Watoga after the nuke and tested both pistols on two different lvl 50 protectrons, shooting both in the center of the chest.  The AA pistol did about 10% more damage, give or take.  The AA took down a bot with 4 shots, while the 2-shot took 5 and left a tiny bit of health that required a sixth shot, all center mass hits to the torso.
---
Months previous I had an AA/vats acc handmade on my sniper, and it performed pretty well.  Of course I was a fool and traded it for a one starred 2-shot version, and almost immediately regretted it.  Pre-nerf, I got a damage boost, but the hipfire accuracy was abysmal and i found that only one shot would hit on enemies that were moving rapidly across my field of view (scorchbeasts, ghouls charging other players, deathclaws, etc.)  The second projectile seems to hit a split second behind the first, and you can clearly hear when both connect.  
---
Basically, AA is far superior to 2-shot, not even just for the raw damage.  2-shot suffers from a slight delay, so it only actually applies both hits when the enemy is slow moving, stationary or charging directly towards you.
---
PCG does this a lot. Something like every other article they publish is either misleading, or regurgitating reddit posts.
---
I started to use their site about a year ago because I don't like Kotaku's layout or much of Polygon's content, and IGN is just a hive of worthless trash and native advertising (which is actually common on a lot of these sites). At first I enjoyed it, but it seems they're increasingly leaning on social media and clickbait to try to compete with other sites. 
---
It's a damn shame. Games journalism has very little integrity these days, though as another person pointed out, journalism in general has been suffering to keep up during the age of the internet... and making some bad decisions along the way.
---
I would love this.
---
Yep that's definitely a lot of it. 
---
Tax Refund! WO^O^O^O^O^O^O^O
---
Never trust a law firm that can't manage using the right form of "their/there/they're" when posting on Reddit
---
lmao well I just did it again, and I think every other time I've left before they went far. This time I  stuck around and they'll path around their spawn building, but then just stop in the road.
---
so you're right! they don't "patrol" at all, they just loiter in the road right by the event once it's over, it just takes them a bit to get to where they stall out, so I never noticed before.
---
I met someone because our camps were close together, but they were no way close in the realm of circles touching and if either one of us rebuilt or moved our camp slightly off, the other could not load the camp. I want to say it felt like you could have at least a whole circle camp between each of us. A lot would need to change to allow at least for them to come close to touching.
---
With Can Do I've found over 90 Canned Coffee in just a few weeks of running through Whitesprings 
---
It's RNG. Sometimes hot and sometimes not.
---
Thank you very much I appreciate it!
---
Same, looks like I'm about to break my rule of not buying atoms.
---
Im on ps4.
---
Basically 76 is fo4 survival light with ad hoc coop.  
---
Visually it's drasticly improved, render range is roughly doubled and object complexity is far higher.  For example, the simple green mod would a big ps4 with maybe 1/4 the trees.  Cost of this is smaller bases, fewer scripted objects  (turrers, settlers, critters) and fewer light sources.
---
Overall I'd say it's an improvement trading npc's for coop.
---
guns feel ok for me...    
---
...because I always use the sneak bonus
---
I'm a mathematician and I know that I understand how to decrypt the codes from the code pieces. I would *never* do it by hand. If there weren't an algorithm available already that I could just pop in and use, I would write and program my own first.
---
I've always enjoyed Gamespot and Gameinformer myself. GI is still a paid subscription model for a lot of their content, but it really shows in their quality.
---
The X-01 is actually nice, not much fan of the "cysts" or whatever they're supposed to resemble, would look better without.
---
T-60 looks pretty nice as well, hopefully the default helmet will fit with the rest of it.
---
I'll definitely consider one or both of these when they come out!
---
Oh well, guess im gonna have to buy some atoms...
---
Too busy being conned to suffer fools, I get it. Maybe if you keep having this problem  it‚Äôs not everyone else, it‚Äôs you.  My comment, which was not at all random but instead intended to inform you the guide you were so happy about was created to manipulate the situation post was meant to be helpful.  I guess that was a lost cause because I, and everyone else, can‚Äôt read.   It isn‚Äôt your fault you have these miscommunications,  it‚Äôs everyone else. 
---
Thanks. Could it be your health also though? But it did increase to absurd number. 
---
They took Fallout 4 and chopped it to pieces. Making things that where already instantly available in Fallout 4 part of player progression in 76. Big mistake, it should have been new content all together that is earned through player progression. Plus zero weapon/armor displays is a huge game changer. No npcs just makes the world empty. People hardly team up as well which is depressing. Maybe once they put in area based chat people will band together. Trading with others is challenging in this way. Sure you could hunt them down and use voice to talk them into something but that just doesnt happen. People want to explore and do things on there own and not be lead around by someone else calling the shots and snagging all the good loot.  
---
I didn't take it negatively, don't worry! You know, I actually can't remember if I tried that or not..I'm gonna give it a try just in case I forgot so thank you for the reminder!
---
Interesting... So even though two unique bullets fire and strike the target independently they perform one damage calculation even though on-hit effects calculate twice? Some comments on all four of those threads seem to go back-and-forth on this, too, and only the wiki seems consistent.
---
Once a friend logs on who will help me transfer my Two Shot Lever Action back to my main I'll test this more since I have both a TS and an AA Lever Action with otherwise identical mods.
---
I got 3 identical 3\* legendary weapons in one event.
---
Level 20 Mutant Slayers Tire Iron, +40% Swing Speed, 90% reduced Weight, I was so exited I decided to share my good fortune, and dropped them all on the way out.
---
No way. I've seen all those skeletons on their inner tubes. Not gonna be my bones you're rattling on your way to Miguel's camp!
---
Fellow solo player - another switch like the pacifist option to prevent trading requests would be good. 
---
If I want to give another player something I'll just drop whatever it is and they can take it. 
---
Found nothing worth selling to other players at any time in the past 95 levels. I either snatch all and scrap for mods, or leave it in place if not useful (partly due to the stash limit and being over encumbered as it is).
---
Similar to another post, it would be better if there could be Runescape-esq Grand Exchange approach where you put your item(s) with a price and allow anyone across any servers to buy. The item shouldn't be able to be withdrawn (after an are you sure, really sure option) otherwise it could be a stash limit exploit, the item only stays available for purchase for 72 hours before being deleted automatically, the price can be altered any any point before expiry. Food has a "spoil" time limit, similar functionality. A single shop approach offers less issues with P2P exploits and aggression when one rejects their trade option and offers a much wider audience.
---
I keep it because I certainly feel like it does. Between Lone Wanderer, Blocker, Dodgy (with Action Boy) and Emergency Protocols in X-01, I am almost impossible to kill unless I do something really stupid.
---
Or unless you're a bloodied melee and I'm wanted.
---
Or you're a bloodied sniper and I'm wanted.
---
Otherwise though, hard as a coffin nail!
---
I want to find the armor that will allow me to feel the same way in non-PA :)
---
Literally the world is my favorite one done so far in fallout. I almost burned out of the game in the first week but a high level gave me a good setup so since I've been hooked on exploring and hunting cryptids, flatwoods monster where you at?
---
The Atom Shop shouldn't have limited time items, maybe with the exception of holiday themed stuff and things like that.
---
I use a text chat mod that a lot of people use 
---
OK thanks I was wondering if that was the case.
---
That's so cool.
---
And nice dog.
---
The T-51 chest emblem/pattern looks like a fidget spinner.
---
Looks like they did the right thing nerfing explosive guns then
---
I just got my keycard, after unlocking the quest a couple weeks ago.  Am level 78, plenty of supplies.  Pretty sure my and my two friends could launch a nuke with not much difficulty.  Just going to organize a time to do it with my group.
---
My question is...  If you put the wrong code in, does it fail and lock you out?  Or can you try again?  Does it consume the keycard on failure?  Etc.
---
Same thing with people complaining about being downvoted for fanboi/hater posts. Maybe if you didn't present your arguments on a daily basis with the tone of an angsty goth pre-teen, people wouldn't downvote you, neh?
---
Or just fix the out of control obviously bugged queen damage resistance. I mean me popping magazines/bobblheads/drugs and bloodied gatling/rifles and not seeing the queen health move at all after breaking multiple guns is obviously broken when sometimes you can take her down in 5-10 minutes (without her landing btw). Theres gotta be an in between where she is difficult but not completely broken. 
---
Even if this happened, the durability (max) would be different, and therefore the 3 weapons could not stack.
---
I used Gamespot for awhile, but the content updates seemed so slow that I just kind of started to forget to check in. xD   And sadly, I'm sure that's why so many sites pad their content with trash...
---
Haven't been to Gameinformer but I'm definitely not down with paying a sub for gaming news, haha. It's good to hear some places still have integrity though. 
---
I think the last site I admired and used regularly was Gamespy. It's a shame the place shut down, I still don't know what happened there.
---
I saw it in the shop but since I didn't have money at the time I came back and bought it a couple weeks later, and everytime I checked the atom shop I saw it up until I uninstalled the game 2 weeks ago.
---
not surprised
---
The fix the bulk junk autoscrapping is reportedly going to take a bit of time to work out. They need to make it so that it still auto-scraps when building &amp; crafting, but won't auto-scrap when scrapping all junk which I guess is going to need a new category of item. The fix they did to stop mods from scrapping when building &amp; crafting is what's causing this behavior, and I'd rather have this than go back to having mods getting scrapped by accident.
---
Yeah I plan on using NukaCrypt to get the codes going forward, but I just want to go through the process of getting the keyword letters and deciphering the code pieces using the keyword for fun. I don't expect that I'll be interested in doing it again after that. 
---
I want to give out quest to players to retrieve me good 3Star weightless armor.
---
Yeah, I am not going to say he is guilty either, but this also isn't a court of law - Bethesda can do whatever they want, reasonable doubt or no. 
---
In all fairness to Bethesda, they posted more than one article about the 100k mark being the criteria, and this guy had over that of several items. He at the very least should not have been surprised when he got the email, and there was no real reason to make such a stink over it unless he really needed to in order to get his case enough publicity to sway them - if his excuse is strong enough, opening a support case would be plenty, and Bethesda has said as much. The old addage "I think thou protests too much" isn't helping his case here.
---
Its not the only problem, the weapon breaks too easy. It breaks after 1¬Ω mag, even with 200% durability and 5/5 weaponsmith perk. Its a known problem, im disappointed they didn't fix it on latest patch.
---
Yeah but that is 10 hours a day. If you played every day. Liking the game is one thing, but that is socially and physically unhealthy. 
---
health and hunger, but hunger shouldn't be involved.
---
I have my camp set up in the woods by a river, far from anything really useful so I understand this completely 
---
I found that after switching guns an reloading, it loads a plasma cell that has the highest charge. 
---
To the point of the reply, a third party service you can use works fine.
---
Did you die of ebola yet? I was really hopeful for that.
---
You can always hang out at a train station or Whitesprings and try to give out your quest through area chat.
---
yeah i think a lot of people who dont notice it are occasional sstealthers or not at the same level of stealth as the people who dod it as their life depends on it with adrenal reaction and bloodied weapons lol. and i bet most of the people dont use escape artist either, because most people dont know how it actually works. it aint working at all now.
---
Definitely not saying you're wrong about that stuff needing to be fixed as well, cause you're 100% right, but lower levels showing up and doing nothing besides standing around/dying to everything on the ground just makes her harder to kill.
---
My friend told me what actually is involved. Not hunger though. Hunger is just coincidence that it makes this happen because of hunger side effect. 
---
Nukaholism is a disease.  She should have joined NA (Nukaholics Anonymous).

I really don't care what people put on it as long as it isn't the bad kind of ear cancer like high pitch noises.
---
Put some pants on. 
---
That is super cool.
---
I‚Äôm level 116 and have never beat her because of this. 
---
I‚Äôve tried a few times but what happens is exactly as you described, not to mention high levels tagging the queen and then not helping. 
---
I know they don‚Äôt want to waste their ammo or whatever, but it sucks. 
---
So you're telling me that within 30 days he respecced at least twice? Can't jump on board with that. I know updates have messed with a few builds. Maybe he was TSE and decided to go melee, then wanted big guns. Like, idk, i forget the exact type of ammo the email specifies, I remember 45 and 5mm. That's a rifle and a heavy gun build. 
---
Can't see any reason someone would go inbetween those two, and even then, you'd only need roughly 9-12 perk points to switch. That point actually reinforces your argument as it increases the amount of times someone can respec, but seriously, why respec even more than twice? Three times? 
---
I applaud you for finding a reason why Mr. 900 could be legit, but it's sorely lacking when you apply it to real world scenarios. 
---
it consumes the keycard on failure but there is no lockout, so once launch prep  is complete your only limiting factor is how many keycards you have if you do not know the code and are trying to brute it
---
10k+karma not worried.
---
If you are less than level 50 you should auto die entering the event. 
---
Looks great! I'm a fan of camps that use pre-existing structures. 
---
Getting a strong sense of Daedric Lord.

Holy shit. Have you actually read what you linked? This is the most mouthbreathing, mind numbing stuff I've seen outside of... well, reddit. Surely there must be a better source of complaints to link to. Shit, at least the people on this sub can communicate like adults... mostly.
---
When you fast travel or load into the club, you're facing the club with the bus against the tennis court. It's the platform left of where you're facing by the corvega. There's a door way with a can chime, don't go inside. Jump into the landscape, and follow it back you'll find a wooden crate. And further down towards the drop off the window. I'll snag a picture later, or if you're on later I can show you.
---
That is more what I meant. Personally I don‚Äôt care if a little kid wants to make a recording of ‚Äúnigger‚Äù and distribute it in-game. And I know someone is free to say that in chat. But something tells me it would be treated differently considering it is recorded, saved, and kept in the game. But this is all just hypotheticals. 
---
Most of the "Gaming" news sites rip their information from reddit, or eachother. Rarely do they have OC content
---
I love the world but hate the material outlay just to "hang out" in the game. Armour repairs got more expensive if you don't wear PA, I'm eating and drinking all the time and ammo is a complete pain in the arse now, what with the limited acid one can collect. My new plan is to convert a Combat Rifle to .38's and see if people will give me what they pick up as i'm not sure many people have a use for it and most chuck it.
---
Love, love, love the world to roam around it, love the music, it's just the niggles that get to me.
---
If that were how they tracked ammo "acquired" his main account wouldn't have been hit for a much smaller number of offending items than his mule account.
---
But with all the games out there, fallout, Bethesda titles, and otherwise, don't you still think it a bit loony to spend all your time on one?  I actually was unemployed for several years and found it difficult to keep up with all the great games out there.  
---
They said it... they didnt tho lol
---
Good to know.  I will make sure my friends and I are well stocked in Keycards (we have 5 between the three of us currently).  Though I will also be making sure we have the right code going in.  But would hate to be caught offguard by a typing mistake.
---
Beyond the robots/turrets/sentry/assaultron dangers, is the prepping for launch process as annoying and unspecified as the "repair nuclear power plant" events are?  Does it send you on a mission to fix various points, but not tell you how many or where the points are, etc.?
---
When I find one of these turret platforms I climb up and sit there tagging spawns with a pistol, then wait for the turrets to finish the job for me and go collect my loot. 
---
Except that small patches often have significant effects on any larger changes you might be trying to make.  I think that's how we ended up with some of the smaller changes (lockpick weight) getting rolled back with a subsequent patch.  The second, bigger patch had changes that negated the smaller patch changes, so you had one branch of the updates ignoring/negating the smaller patch.
---
I'm assuming *some* level of competence in the process that got broken, though it's also possible that there is *no* competence at all and everyone is running around individually trying to put out fires.  If there is a high level of competence and coordination, your example would probably work well, assuming you had enough staffing to have testing people also updating dev people's work in unison (so at least 1 team working on both branches).  I don't have a lot of confidence that this is the case, however.
---
Only time I complain about downvoting is the pure negative downvote every post crap.
---
This post speaks of witchcraft. I am shocked... Shocked I say. 
---
You mean all the stuff I see on the interwebs isn't true! OMG!  How it that even allowed?
---
Dear Bethesda. You suck ass. You release a turd and call it a diamond. What a joke. You can keep your other games too. I've been burned by this piece of trash game. Won't happen again. 
---
Can I ask where did you find it?
---
How long does it usually take for the keyword to show up in the command center? Does it only show up in full at the end of the week or is the whole keyword displayed by Thurs/Friday?
---
That's pretty much what it was.
---
Oh believe me, I know fully well why the bug was introduced. I wrote an essay here on reddit, about this 2 week back. As for how much time it needs to resolve, allow me to have my reservations.
---
Yeah from what I heard the silo will consume the nuke keycard, but if you have more keycards you can try again. 
---
I'm at least competent at the snare drum. Hit me up of you need a player!
---
From personal testing, while ADS with a ts gun, if one of the projectiles misses, there is noticeably less damage to the enemy every time. I would say the damage is split, with the extra projectile getting 25% of the weapons dmg.
---
I hate it when we can't take pictures. 
---
If i were to go there, i was thinking of getting a Dry-Pak to put my phone in, put it around my neck then cross my arms to hold it without getting caught as camera records.
---
Or would they check our phones????

I think of saving things to show in the future but no cameras = nothing to show

I would like a belly laugh emote. Instead I do the radiation emote.

If transferring back and forth made items count more than once than his main would have been hit for far more than his mule was. Instead his main account had far less rare ammo.
---
This is just hilarious - oh Bethesda, you keep on doing you!
---
^^^ THIS.
---
I'm sorry you haven't gotten to beat the queen yet, it fucking sucks when this happens. I have also witnessed high levels just tagging her and then just hiding or only fighting stuff on the ground. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the folks who fight the hoards while SBQ is in the air, but it drives me crazy when they don't help out after she lands.
---
Do stored building items (walls, foundations, etc.) still count towards a C.A.M.P.'s budget? 
---
Fallout 4 had a big creative or "build" community. I want to build a new base from scratch but keep my old building items so I can show the old blueprints to friends later. 
---
I don't mind having a buildable budget but having to manage the budget of stored building items is very tedious.
---
A time from of 24 hours to have to buy something that you easily can miss if .. I don't know, have a job, family or other things that might take you away from the game a day or two is total horse shit.  Nothing should ever be available for less than a week.
---
T60 is SICK!!!
---
Lol thanks dude
---
Yeah it should really be a lvl 50 event which would make it more rewarding imo for everybody and if you don‚Äôt have decent gear by lvl 50 you need to find some legendary farming guides and get to work. I‚Äôve had instances where the whole server was there but because everyone was pitching in her health bar melted, but I‚Äôve also experienced what happened to you and it feels like a wast of time/ammo
---
Any idea what the symbol on the chest symbolizes?
---
...I like this, someone hire this man
---
They must be attempting to apply the thinnest coat of veneer imaginable.
---
You really should consider it, SSDs make for a huge performance improvement, and until recently they used to cost much more than that. I've got three 1TB SSDs in my PC now, and everything is so smooth and quick.
---
Not that there is an option to report someone anyways 
---
You can build together at a workshop. Not the same but it's something
---
That is one of the saddest things I have read. 
---
&gt; But the problem is he says he moved it around from alt to his main multiple times. BSG has admitted that they can't tell where you get items from or if the items are unique. Which means they could be counting his ammo stash multiple times for however many times he swapped it from one character to another. Which means he might not have anywhere near that much ammo if they are counting it 5 or 6 times for each time he moved it from his alt to his main and back.
---
Easiest way to see which is the case would be to check his inventories currently and see if he actually has that much or if it is just the same ammo he moved from his alt to his main and back and forth being counted multiple times.
---
I love that bartender at white springs. You don‚Äôt even need to buy just go over the counter and grab some. 
---
They banned the dude because even Bethesda couldn't believe anyone would enjoy this pile of crap that much lmao 
---
Holy fuck those look fantastic!
---
He had over 100,000 of Ultracite ammo.  There's no way he did that.  Bethesda nailed him fair and square.
---
I had the same thing yesterday morning before the patch, I built a turret and gears was in white then I built another one and the text turned green for gears, I was at the Poseidon plant, I dismissed it as one of those things and thought it was just me or just the server I was on. There were already some items built there left over from the previous owner although it said un-owned so I don‚Äôt know if that had anything to do with it.
---
Nah, I actually get this way too. When I really get into a game, I hyper obsess over it. Games that have a lot of grind and no real "end" to them like Diablo 3, Path of Exile... when I really get hooked on a game like that, it's all I do. I could absolutely see myself spending 10-12 hours per day playing a single game for months on end, until I really get tired of it. Some of us really enjoy the grind and finding ways to optimize ourselves and become more powerful.
---
It's hard to explain, but it feels like "why would I play anything else? I could be doing \_insert important stuff\_ in Fallout 76.. or whatever game I'm obsessing over.
---
It's a hardcore gamng mindset. If you play games like Fallout mostly for the great story and such, I can 100% see why this kind of gaming would seem so alien to you. 
---
This sure sounds easy to exploit. Let's not add more of that into the game
---
These are better then any mod I've seen for power armor. (Paints not new PA)
---
Why do you say it‚Äôs intentional? They acknowledged that it‚Äôs not working properly and said they‚Äôre looking into it. They didn‚Äôt say, oh yeah, we nerfed it. Did I miss something?
---
Server hopped a bunch for that, never saw it.
---
 At least build a stage.

I can't confirm or deny that as I am only lvl 29 so I don't have Escape Artist yet. Without it Stealth seems to be fine so maybe it is the Perk that is broken and not Stealth in general?
---
I was banned. Got the generic 100k email around noon on Monday, still can't get logged it. Opened a ticket like others have done. A friend was banned as well ,got the generic 100k email around same time, couldn't get logged in. Yesterday he was able to login and was only missing 2 guns he had traded for. He did not receive a email stating was unbanned/susspension over. Im wondering if that has happened for others and is still ongoing.
---
Auto die and booted from server
---
Speed demon mutation.
---
Well, gossip in and of itself isn't objective, like all journalists strive to be. It can be pretty obvious that most gaming "journalists" are basically shills. (Lookin' at you IGN). Some try to be objective, mostly smaller sites (Polygon does a decent job imo). While most mainstream sites jump on the bandwagon, forbes, kotaku, pc gamer, etc. It's a narrative to them and anything going against the narrative won't be viewed as much and therefore is refused by the editor. 
---
Before anthem started being shat-on on reddit, Kotaku dropped a pretty fluffy post. Granted, most Anthem complaints are "omg loading screens," "wow this ui is bad im a bougie bitch," or "where the endgame, I just binged the whole game I want moar," Kotaku will drop an article about loading screens or how "Anthem players are finding their own way to have fun without an endgame." See, that last one hits 2 birds with 1 stone: Bashes the game and fluffs the community (aka your readers). 
---
Speed demon. It‚Äôs a mutation that grants...I wanna say 20% faster movement and reload speed. 
---
I'd suggest waiting another month, give or take. They're still ironing out issues (see this subreddit for examples). Right now it's a modest game, fun while you level and explore but pointless once you reach the "endgame." It definitely needs friends for shenanigans right now, and hopefully new end game content soon.
---
Aw MAN now I wish i hadn‚Äôt gotten the Mothman armor. Guess I‚Äôm gonna have to shell out for atoms.
---
It‚Äôs endgame not for xp farming. I despise shooting 4000 rounds of 5mm, breaking two Gatling guns and seeing a level 11 run out of the shed when it‚Äôs over. 
---
Thank you for your life story. It was ok
---
Does anyone have a link to the original post and his alibi? 
---
Did you use NukaCrypt to get the code?
---
Items, would remain in your Stash box, so it does not increase your overall capacity, they are accessible from the vending machines when designated "for sale".
---
Upon logging Off, available inventory would update on the vending machine, as the Items in your Stash box are no longer in world (server)
---
Since there are only 12 players per server, with each players being limited on the amount, it shouldn't be unmanageable.
---
I honestly commend all of you for still sticking it out with this game. That‚Äôs some serious dedication and you all deserve at least a pat on the back. I couldn‚Äôt do it after just a few weeks after launch. I really don‚Äôt know how you guys do it, but Bethesda should show some appreciation for those of you still hanging in there through all of this nonsense. 
---
The so-called "banned" for nothing 900 guy admitted to even using a macro for harvesting in his guide he wrote explaining everything he did for all ammo and things. It' also only mentioned using SuperDuper and an ammosmith perks. However, he never mentioned green thumb or anything to get more flux or anything like that in his guide. He also said in his guide that he uses a macro that clicks e really fast to get more items than what is supposed to get for harvesting which is duping anyway. It is also the same way to dupe guns and ammo and things. This guide he did was before the whole ban wave for duping that he said he got caught in the ban wave by mistake. But he also had said he wrote guide after being banned and not being able to get on the game to play. He posted the guide At least a whole day before the ban wave happened. There are so many inconsistent things from the 900-hour guy I find it hard to believe he is telling any kind of truth.  
---
I do not know how the silo quests go down, I haven't entered one yet but I plan to with my team this week. 
---
Agreed, 100%
---
I just did some tests and it seems that only certain legendary prefixes a get a benefit from adrenal reaction now.
---
no-benefit: anti-armor, mutants, instigating, hunters (explosive)
---
benefit: bloodied (swing speed), furious, vampiric 
---
TLDR:  Being banned sucks ass.  If you want to avoid it, don't cheat.
---
And some people are reporting it works while others report it works until they relog, then adrenal reaction gets broke again. The community manager also wanted to know about Radworms so it looks like they are at play in some way. Telling players to remove the mutation and reapply it would be fine if we could chose what we lose, or if that‚Äôs the only mutation you have. Otherwise, they are asking the players to sink more time, caps, and/or resources redoing things on their character they have already done because they broke the game, again. It is not a fix.
---
Neon Slocum Joe and Nuka cola? Cannot wait
---
We have all kinds of bunkers. Eleanor WV has a bunker beneath the city pool, or so ive heard, idt that one has been confirmed

Stealth Nerf is when they change something and don't mention it in the patch notes or to the public they change it in the hopes no-one will notice.
---

This is the link i was looking for yesterday.  Scroll down and click on the specific special stat to see all passive affects.

The whole shtick was "rebuilding the country," so I assumed towns/cities would be in the plans. I also game with my husband, and we were frustrated to find out that we couldn't build a small mansion together.
---
I'm curious what your spreadsheet's plots are showing. I also am curious how you verified the Two Shot mechanics you suggested above. I'm also curious how it resolves if the two shots hit different targets with your setup.
---
I also did some numerical testing and confirmed that Two Shot's listed damage gain is weaker when you factor in mods:
---
confirmed your point about mods not being taken into account with the +25% figure.
---
Prefix|Mod|Weapon Type|Perks|Listed Damage
---
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
---
TS|Hardened|Lever Action|No Perks|111
---
AA|Hardened|Lever Action|No Perks|93
---
That's an increase of 19.4% with the Hardened Receiver.
---
If what I have in the OP is incorrect then I'd want to fix it, but I can objectively see my AA weapon hitting harder than my TS weapon with an identical setup, so I have to believe that AA is stronger. I just need to figure out the mechanic of _how_ if I'm wrong in the OP.
---
Just search 900 hours or search Top Posts of the last week in the sub
---
If I had to guess, there's also a bunch of real players dropping off as well. I've ran into the same PvP team twice since patch. 
---
Close but sadly untrue :). This is the multiplier to the base dmg so the final dmg i  the hit points is weapon_dmg[(weapon_dmg/dmg_resistance)√ó0.15]^0.365. So while the multiplier itself is bigger in a anti-armor, in the two-shot you're multiplying to a higher weapon_dmg at the end so it ends up being always bigger if the weapon has more than 20 base dmg I think. 
---
More then 300,000 actually
---
It seems vaguely reminiscent of the Biohazard symbol.
---
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Biohazard_symbol_%28black_and_yellow%29.png
---
Just with the outside circles being inverted (interior visible circles instead of visible arcs around the circles).  The center ring appears there, rotated about 60 degrees.
---
Which of course, would be more imagery of Pestilence than Famine, adding another mix of imagery into the choices.
---
Would it allow him to run up a mountain in 15-20 seconds
---
I would actually like adrenaline reaction to scale with hunger and thirst haha would be a nice nerf to bloodied/adrenaline which I think it needs.
---
That might be super obvious haha, the tour groups are relatively small and they collect all cameras/phones and give them back to you at the end of the tour. I got the impression that if the data security firm found out cameras/phones had made it through the tour they might limit or end the tours entirely due to the risk. 
---
They give you some printed photos at the end of the tour and there are a ton of photos on Google - not the same as your own, maybe, but at least you'll know the story behind them! The tour is amazing and worth every penny.
---
Would speed demon let someone sprint up a mountain in 15-20 seconds
---
The Atom store is what pays the bills for new content development.
---
For the game to continue, it needs both players and payers. Servers cost money. Artists cost money. Programmers cost money.
---
Reasons why this is not a  good solution:
---
1) Radial menu is already too easy to fill with items that you really need to quick-switch to, like during a firefight. Between weapons and grenades I don't have enough room already, so definitely no room for food/water items in there. (I would actually love an entire second radial for aid items)
---
2) you can bulk craft food but there's really no point. You're either going to eat it all, which drops it out of the radial, or it's going to rot before you can eat it, which drops it out of the radial. Either way it means constantly having to put different food items into the radial. And having to scroll through all your food items anyway to re-select them into the radial menu sort of defeats the purpose of having a quick-access wheel.
---
3) the variety of stuff I craft all depends on what food mats I happen to have on hand, so again we're back to the problem of having to re-assign the quick slot probably just as often as you actually use it.
---
Building in this game is a living hell, getting plabs for things is time consuming, and most of the cool items are atom shop. Its rewarding if you make something cool. If you want, I can send you a picture of the camps I've built
---
Or at least the mouth harp that is in the game but not craftable :(
---
Which makes them useless for vats builds~
---
At least thats good to know.
---
These were datamined months ago, so nobody hold their breath for a timely release. 
---
I think I need to apply that logic to my entire play strategy. Blew through my stash weight increase in 2 hours.
---
Same, I've been watching the game and popping in once every few weeks to see the updates. While I'm glad to see its chugging along there are definitely some things that still need addressing. 
---
Dude, so many people have this issue. Given the state of the game, yours is an odd conclusion to get to. Also, only three crashes at critical moments? Luckyyyy. 
---
You are correct, they did not stack in my inventory.
---
Well that again begs the question why would someone take on immense farming to generate such an overlap on ammo? Like if it was 240k of 5mm ammo he could fire a 400 rpm Minigun for 10! hours straigh (no reloading). Why?
---
Having 100k .38 ammo is night and day different from having 100k Ultracite ammo
---
You could get a passcode though I guess. And the game could allow for players to choose if it‚Äôs locked or not, for the folks that like helping others.
---
Once can only hope for robotic buttercup mounts now. 
---
If they are in a team and they have the charisma card which makes mutations stronger when in a group, they could be pretty fast.
---
I will when I attempt it.  I have never done it before.  But I will use a combination of NukaCrypt and the Community to verify my code is valid prior to entering.
---
Have you seen the ones coming up?
---
Sound salty af 
---
its all linear in the silo as the "puzzles" will be in the main room or a side room at each point, but there are puzzles that tell you to fix/destroy x items that wont give you a specific location.  it will give you a rough count on each fix/destroy though with a fill bar
---
Speed Demon mutation takes about 4 seconds off the Dragon, I have a Union Soldier build and it's fun.
---
Yeah I live in Charleston, its fun to walk by the Capitol lol
---
Which is why depleting stacks to 1 was a good call, so people who get crazy strokes of luck (ie you) get to keep their weapons, even if they are tire irons lol
---
Huh.  Maybe it's boxing, where a coach will call for a specific punch with a weird name so the opponent doesn't just hear the opposing corner shouting "uppercut! uppercut!".  Not sure why Bethesda would need to conceal an identity in the coding, but it might be an inside joke amongst the team.
---
Funny how these "major patches" really haven't accomplished more than some item item and game setting tweaks.
---
Best ones I am in are when the melee players keep the mob off the heavy gunners knowing they will get their shot when she lands. These fights usually end the quickest. If you are a shotgun build you can keep them off the heavies laying down anti aircraft fire. 
---
Yeah, kinda reminded me of that but didn't look similar enough. The nuclear symbol as well but that one's resemblance is even further away.
---
How do you know for certain? You can't. Just somebody fast traveling for a sec it respawn.
---
Yeah that would be nice to see how your camps look! I mean f4 is a pain in the ass vanilla but with some console commands and a (lot) of mods its easy peasy! 
---
I dont think the actual skins/models are in the game yet. War Rider (Second one in your Link) has been in since beta but i haven't found any new PA skins in the BSA file from yesterdays update.
---
Melee player, afraid his big hammer is getting nerfed next.
---
LPT go the speed limit everywhere 
---
The reason I bought the game was because it had Lewisburg and the Cranberry Glades. I'm from Lewisburg (Frankford really) and my family usuallly camps at the Glades around every Mothers Day. 
---
Ok, I guess what we need are about 10 volunteers.  
---
Those people should spend the next 40 hours grinding as hard as they can, using whatever method they feel is the most efficient, and see how much ultracite ammo they can accumulate through legitimate means in that time period.  Then, we take that data and extrapolate it to form some realistic numbers on what would and would not be possible over 900 hours.
---
Next, we need some other volunteers, willing to risk their accounts, who spend a few hours trading 'rare items' too and from an alt/mule until they have 'acquired' 100K or more of something in a short period of time, say transferring a couple thousand ultracite rounds back and forth 50 times.
---
Of course, this will all need to be streamed and archived, so that we can evaluate and improve upon farming methods to ensure the volunteers are actually maximizing their playtime and gaining as much ultracite ammo as possible.
---
THEN, we as a community each write up individual reports based on that data with our conclusions, post them here for a 'peer review' and make our final indisputable determination on Mr. 900 Hours' guilt or innocence.
---
Until then...CAN WE FUCKING DROP THIS?
---
It's ok I still like you 
---
Don't get too excited for mods, private servers and building mods are years away from being added at the moment.
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as4fxi/dev_cells_are_still_accessible_with_nuke_codes_as/?st=jsdlwkbz&amp;sh=02c0bad0) was found by /u/Waffle_cop and I don't recall seeing any notes on it in the update.
---
I think if you take the biohazard symbol and fill all the interior yellow spots with Black and then erase the existing black spots, you will get the symbol on the Pale Rider's chest.  With very few modifications (doesn't look like you even need to rotate it, like I first thought).
---
Except Mothman is more of a hero irl.
---
Missed the Hot Rodder paints? The T-45 and T-60 look great. Both sets have plenty of pink. A bit of purple too as a result of the gradients, if I'm not mistaken. 
---
All kinds of different parts, its like the state scaled down into this map
---
This is how most news and media is nowadays, especially when they have something against who they're reporting on\~ like if they dislike 76 themselves. They leave out the full story/context due to being bias or too lazy to do more research first or no research at all since many just plagiarize each other.
---
The guy claims he‚Äôs injured and can‚Äôt really do much physically so these games are his one form of release. Its totally plausible to me especially in the MMORPG world, 10 hours a day is actually kinda healthy when comparing to other games like WOW where people literally play for 20+ hours straight. Now I‚Äôve gotta go re-watch the South Park WOW episode 
---
Nope didn't even take their junk. Left gorge and forgot about it. Just took it for the challenge lol

Speed demon mutation

Luck perk quick hands i think though i haven't tried that one

I got an instigating black powder rifle long time ago and still have it.  My adrenaline rank five must've been kicking in cause i one shotted a scorch beast who just climbed out the fissure with a critical shot.

No but there is a bunker under the Greenbrier (whitesprings resort)
---
They just buffed our stash limit AGAIN.
---
Proven salty.
---
if you are only level 29 you havent really had to rely on stealth yet. stealth is easy at lower levels.
---
People acting like that's not true of *all* programming... 
---
Go on a sub like programmerhumor and see how many reposts and variations there are of jokes about fixing one bug and multiple new bugs show up.
---
I craft 25 to 30 of the same food, and craft again once it‚Äôs done, so it repopulates it.  I grow crops in my camp for this purpose, so I do not ever have to deviate.  My radial is blissfully efficient and not clogged because of my build/play style, I guess.

What are some good perks for the black powder rifle? I just got a 3 star one that has a 15% faster reloading speed, vats accuracy, and super mutant damage. What perks should i get to test this bad boy out? 
---
I just cracked level 30 lol. I only get to play about 3-4 hours a week on average and didn't start till around Christmas. 
---
Bring me plastic! Dildos are important!
---
This is a huge improvement over they way they first implemented the message about your CAMP not being placed. As soon as they did that, I was wishing for the option to immediately try another server, rather than having to load in, exit the world, and try again.
---
Speed demon mutation makes reloading faster?
---
what perks do yo8u have on?
---
I haven't seen Grahm in over a month, and I've played somewhere around 75 hours in that time, with a good bit of exploring. (Meanwhile, I've been awarded useless junk by the lottery robot about a dozen times!) Last time I saw Grahm was on the same road as the Overseer's camp, so I agree that's probably a good place to start looking.
---
i only go in the shed when i need to put the controller down to step away from the game for a second..i am wearing a hazmat suit..but im not hiding lol
---
Yeah that's what I'm afraid of, i guess time will tell
---
Black Rider, T-60. Mother of God...it‚Äôs so beautiful...

The mechanics are assumed to be a copy+paste from FO4 (this has born true in a lot of cases). Bethesda partly confirmed this when acknowledging that the added projectile was +100% damage before being nerfed to +25% - in other words one additional unmodified projectile at 100% of base damage.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_weapon_effects
---
"The game uses the combined damage to calculate the damage reduction multiplier of the target's armor, so when both bullets hit, it does the same damage that one bullet with the combined damage would do."
---
This is also how shotguns work.
---
I account for adding 25% damage before weapon mods, *Weapon Damage* 69.75/58.5 = 1.192.
---
Coming from FO4 with a primary focus on building and building mods, I can tell you that FO76 is anything but "advanced" in comparison. More challenging? Yes but only because of the things you mentioned such as aggressive snapping (too many snap points in the coding) and many other buggy things. Additionally, the craftable item list pales in comparison to the FO4 base game - FO76 is extremely limiting. With regards to mods, I am not a PC player but my understanding is that just regular mods to FO76 are limited and didn't think that Bethes has approved game modding yet. I bought FO76 so that I was able to play (mostly build) with others and was sorely disappointed. If they approve modding in the future, which will be on private Bethes owned servers from what I have read, will be a lot more fun for us who love the building aspect. Just my 2 cents. 
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that was super unimpressed with the Gauss. I hear lots of people say they are using them, but I think they are all running legendary effects.
---
We had it good for a long time. Early days, the game was a single player game (in terms of loot and advancement) in a multiplayer world. 
---
MMOs need some element of grind to keep people coming back in between DLC etc. 
---
the amount of people I‚Äôve seen over level 200 is insane, and let‚Äôs be real here, nobody should be that level 3 months after the games release. 
---
Bethesda are only now turning it into an MMO by nerfing everything and bringing back the grind. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
I was really hoping the Excavator and Raider suits would be getting skins in this bundle. 
---
As a lifelong resident of WV I find you completely delusional. Unless your idea of fun is sitting inside all day every day
---
They changed to code to reflect the lower damage, just did not tell people about it.
---
Excavator armor users over here with Pikachu reaction face.  
---
You need to learn to not get triggered by opinion pieces that basically only you would see anyway. It's targeted at you, who else is looking at the games nuances this far after release if they don't already have it?
---
Hehe, I think if you state a lot of the things we do in these games in their aggregate forms they'll look pretty ridiculous, especially at first glance.  
---
To answer your question though, human psychology is outside my wheelhouse. I could only speculate as to why, but in my experience the inability for most people to answer that question about an act does not preclude the act from occurring in the first place :p
---
Finishing Mistress of Mystery at level 21 soured me on the main missions, since I was 4 levels away from being able to use the rewards. Started grinding and farming screws for excavator power armor so I could build that at 25, then kept screw farming while learning all the mods for the lower level weapons (10mm, pipe guns, shotguns, rifles including handmade gun and lever action rifle, etc). Level 35 I picked up the main quest lines again, upgraded my Order of Mysteries stuff, did the Free States quests, and started the BOS questline at level 38. Currently 39, tonight I'm doing the DMV and I'm going to divide my time between BOS and farming mole miners to make level 45 excavator power armor. Still getting rewards I can't use, but I scrap them and keep moving ahead, knowing there will be better rewards in the future.
---
Ah so your someone who disregards everything that happens and only complains about the small things. Got it. 
---
If your buying Fallout 76 to build, you'd be better off getting Minecraft, in my opinion.
---
If youre on ps4 I believe I have a 2 shot non explosive im not using
---
And we should be able to give quests to kill raiders. 10-15 noobs will try and fail to kill you then 1 guy with op gear will kill you. Lol
---
It is in the code dupe posted today, not speculation.
---
Of course they make an article. Games 'journalism' is about the laziest of all forms of journalism. Just go to a gaming subreddit, find something with a lot of comments and just copy it like you'd copy homework from a friend in highschool.
---
Wonder why Nevada didn't do this for New Vegas? Too much tourism anyways due to Vegas? Doesn't mean people going to Vegas are going to go to other places like state parks...
---
looks like she was trying to make a Cola-Angel. 
---
I was trying to clear AMS HQ last night and I could walk right up to the top floor crouched (escape artist, chameleon armor) and I could shoot a bot or turret or two with a suppressed shotgun and 50% of the time stayed in caution or hidden.  
---
However...
---
I was hidden in the middle of the third floor area with all the turrets around, no shots fired yet, and used rad-x and they all went aggro and literally blew me into the wall and I got stuck and had to leave the server. I tried the rad-x again when I came back in and it did the same thing but I could escape and regain stealth. It was the chem animation that seemed to be doing it. I didn't know that could do that. I used chems in stealth all the time before and don't remember it blowing my cover.
---
The plan or the mutation I have the mutation serum already made 300 caps psn brc_nadeau
---
I mean he said he played since beta, long before the best builds were already laid out, He may have respecced 5 or 6 times trying out new builds he wanted to try(which is actually what he says in his OP) and to see which build would work best for his play style.
---
I'm nowhere near level 450 and I've respecced a few times because I don't get into the whole "follow this cookie cutter guide to a t" and I wanted to try out different play styles. I don't see why this guy should get penalized for doing the same thing lots of people do.
---
He even said it in his OP that he swapped the bullets to his alt and back quite a few times, sometimes even on accident since he had multiple characters in the same area running multiple games in tabs. I could easily see someone alt tabbing to a different game window to pick up the ammo and not pay much attention and pick it up by the wrong character then drop it and pick it up by the right one.
---
Everyone is looking at his actions through the 20/20 hindsight brings, prior to this ban wave no one knew it was against the rules to have more than 100k of any ammo and didn't know dropping ammo and picking it up would increase the ammo cap for that 30 day span. Which is why I am so confused when people say, "Oh it is suspicous that he would move his stuff from one character to another multiple times" when to me I don't see how that would be suspicous as to me that has zero bearing on playing the game and I see that more as just how someone chooses to mule their items.
---
But I do come from playing games like Path of Exile where alt accounts to hold gear is extremely common and needed by most end game players. So it just seems crazy to me all these people are jumping down the guys throat because he decided to mule gear like people do in online games. Sure it can look suspicous after a ban wave like this happens where now we know that moving ammo around between characters can screw with the way BSG counts your gear, but prior to this ban wave no one knew that.
---
It just makes no sense for the 900 hour guy to go from reporting dupers and exploits to BSG then later duping himself and only duping ammo... If you are gonna dupe why would you only dupe ammo? That makes no sense, likewise, why would he report exploits he could have kept for himself to utilize if he was duping?
---
I don't know if the guy is innocent or not, all I do know is people are acting like he is guilty for sure with no real proof of anything.
---
I mean look at BSG's track record with this game, do you really think it is impossible for them to screw up how their algorithm checks for item numbers you've had go through your inventory over a 30 day span? I mean they have yet to put out a patch that hasn't caused new bugs, so I doubt they could implement something like that without it also having some bugs.
---
I've already seen people who make mods for this game and fallout 4 confirm that BSG has no way of telling where non unique items are acquired from or if the item is unique. So that means they have no way of telling where ammo he picked up comes from, whether or not its from his alt or not and whether or not it is a unique stack of ammo he hadn't picked up previously.
---
All I am saying is, I don't think we should be jumping down the guys throat about this because there is a decent chance he might be legit, and it would really suck if we would run off a die hard player like him if he was legit just because people still seem to think BSG can do no wrong.
---
Nah, you're right. It's a lot to do, but. If you're not working, you can just leave the game up. Go shower, eat. Etc. This isn't China, where you get punished for playing video games. Legally, you can do that here. It's very possible.
---
No one was conned. The farming guide was helpful. You had to be a cunt on a comment you had no business even replying back o except for the sake of making a comment. It added nothing but your quip. And I called you out on it. Now you‚Äôre all mad you weren‚Äôt thanked for making a dumb comment. Go cry somewhere else please. 
---
The problem of asking a question and getting unrelated answers is obviously the unrelated answers. If I ask ‚Äúwhat is two plus two‚Äù and get a diatribe of the values of math vs philosophical complexities of letting math run out thinking, the issue wasn‚Äôt me, but the person answering what was not asked.
---
I don‚Äôt care that it was made to manipulate the situation. That is what it is. But the facts were solid to follow. Go here. Go there. Why he created it doesn‚Äôt affect me, as I reap the benefits regardless. You can all have your political tearfest without me. I don‚Äôt need that
---
And lastly, yeah, it is your fault. Please think before posting, and make it relevant. Thanks in advance. You tried, I get it, but it didn‚Äôt work out. Oh well. Get over it.
---
Yes. On all my bloodied weapons melee and guns.
---
My deathclaw is at 1000+, no perks, handmade 700+, lever action 1100+.
---
Its related to the adrenal reaction cuz i see the damage increase even when its not equipped.
---
Adding you right now.
---
The Fireproof perk got a useful buff a few patches ago. Stash limit got buffed twice. Travelling Pharmacy got buffed to work on more chems (technically it got fixed, since it should have worked on those chems to begin with, but the net effect is that the perk is more beneficial than it was before).
---
Sweet
---
Really? I saw a group of dudes dressed as the silver shroud they seemed to think it worked but also as a solo player could totally be wrong having not played in groups much.
---
Just for those out of the loop. 900 hours guy is a complete and udder bitch and deserves whatever he gets. 
---
He cheated. He lied. He got caught. 
---
Fuck off, PC gamer you stupid fucking trump-era bass ackwards click bait super faggots.
---
Unexploitable? Is that an alternative spelling for "hold my beer?" ;)
---
So you're the dumbass that falls for yongyea's clickbait bullshit videos about something from 2 weeks ago which gave a pidly amount of health for wearing an outfit for 5 days when an outfit is also available in game without using the atom shop.
---
Still have my explosive assassins black powder pistol. But when it went from 890 dmg to 375 dmg I stashed it in hopes it may be viable again
---
If you have any bulk steel I‚Äôll trade you the mutation for 10 bulk steel
---
900 hours
---
More than 300,000 ultracite bullets.
---
Yeah, he's full of shit.
---
I mean, that's how my bloodied unyielding unarmed build always worked anyway. 15 hp, 1500 damage.
---
I wish I could find a job as illegitimate as making news articles from reddit comments.
---
It's definitely worth a stay at the Greenbrier for that alone. It could be back to a fully operational bunker in a few short hours. 
---
yep at the armour workbench - am not a complete idiot!
---
Also prefer playing this game with a controller, not hunched forward too close to my screen.
---
The only way Ive found of any use is unplugging the controller in game, the game goes into K&amp;M mode, then plug in (or re insert the batteries) again. My push to talk is set to caps-lock, and still works when using the controller this way. Far from ideal, but not the worst solution and no need for 3rd party software just for one game.
---
But its beyond me why they didnt have a press and hold button for push to talk, much like build mode. Would prefer a controller push to talk button than a 3rd person button I never use. But is what it is.
---
So again, try your keyboard shortcut. If not working, un plug, plug in again your controller. And it should work :)
---
I was sad to find out that the DMV is real 
---
I have the caps. Not sure on the steel will check.
---
Happened both times I logged on today,had to restart game-Xbox 1
---
Exactly it‚Äôs actually easily do able with all the right perks and crafting 5mm or .50 cal ammo but I guess people can‚Äôt comprehend why someone would do that.. still think it‚Äôs dumb to think too logically about an online fantasy world but hey that‚Äôs just me  
---
Honest people hate it, but they can‚Äôt stop you from doing this one thing 
---
Sad that this has more upvotes than the post itself
---
So with this setup I get the following math, check me here:
---
`Unmodified: 100*((100/300) ^ 0.366)*0.5 = 33.4459568486`
---
`Modified: 119.4*((119.4/300) ^ 0.366)*0.5 = 42.6119624365`
---
`Damage Compare: (42.6119624365/33.4459568486)*100=127.405421915`
---
`Net Damage Increase: 27.41%`
---
It‚Äôs all good if you don‚Äôt Caps always welcome
---
Better than be the sheep who buy broken games....
---
But is the lead pipe AA?
---
Had a friend do the quest and trade me the uniform he got for the reward
---
i put two screen shots on ny link, with hunger going lower and increasing its damage. check the edits on my post
---
&lt;------ SpeedShotgun Build User :  If you want the max speed in game'( caped at +20%), don't use speed demon. Take a perk that gives you +20% move speed like squad manouver, gun runner or Death Man Sprint / grim reaper (don't no the right name of the Agility perk) and break the caped 20% by using a weapon with legendary effect '' faster move speed while aiming ''. It gives you maybe +5% more speed. Speed demon repressed all other speed effects from Perks and legendary effect. :)
---
Yeah it's soooooo broken I literally just stand in one spot for hours at a time....
---
They also second time nerfed weapons durabilities. They did this last update and now.
---
This I‚Äôve noticed since launch. I thought I was crazy
---
Ah my camp is right there that was super convenient thanks!
---
If that were how it worked, his main account would be getting hit for a similar number as his mule account is. Instead it's getting hit for a lot less.
---
I launched five this past Saturday. I launched three on Saturday. Two on Monday. I've seen plenty of other people launching as well, most frequently evenings and weekends. Saw someone else's triple hit on Prime just a day or two ago.
---
I don't blame you - still waiting!
---
If they didn't change TS having 2x the condition degradation then it's still a no-brainer.
---
If you have fun with a game, then who cares?
---
Thanks you for writing that out, so sick of people getting upset about something that‚Äôs finished. There are some legit thing wrong with game this is not one of them.
---
&gt;im gonna mute this thread because messing with conservatives has gotten boring
---
...
---
I mean, I didn't read all the banal replies, but wtf?
---
I think it more accurately shows how hysterical people can be. 
---
It's ok man, you got to lie to yourself in order to not feel bad about it, how is that nylon bag going on for you though ?
---
Do I need to pick the numbers on sales, reviews and refunds ?
---
Also to be able to view items complete stats within the trade menu. "What are the three stars on your -xxxx- that you have?", "Hold on while I back out and check"... Drives me F@ck1n nuts!
---
The person that data mined the latest ESM noted some references to PaleRider which is what got me curious.
---
they buffed automatic weapons. maybe was patch 3 or 4 i forget.
---
rifle perks all 3 maxed out, bloody mess, demo. Those r the damage perks i use.
---
The power armor paints?
---
The temporary +15 HP unstoppables from before valentine's day/
---
What we talkin' bout Willis?
---
GTFO and don't come back then.
---
Why didn't you post this when these outfits (i assume you're talking about the 5 day health boost outfits) were released - WEEKS AGO?
---
I'm tired of the oft-repeated "unplyable" trope.
---
Yes there are bugs but to call it unplayable is blatantly false.
---
I just think people are bored.  There's not a lot for endgame players to do.  Nukes are kind of the "apex" but really it's not a major thing.  
---
The game needs more endgame content and activities.  Repeating the same game loop over and over gets old.  Personally I only log in maybe once or twice a week tops these days and often skip multiple weeks, as all there is for me to do is try to grind legendary drops which is unrewarding for me.  
---
I can see how people get into PvP just as a way to break up the routine.
---
West Virginians are used to getting shit on so it's no big deal.  
---
Yea all those locations are dope and I seriously want to visit the place now...
---
but I'll be honest. I'm more excited for an opportunity to see a real live "Sheetz" than any of the FO76 locations.
---
Addicted to a lacklustre husk of a video game at that.
---
Whoa... this explains a lot.
---
I need this in my life. Just for fun
---
Appears to be correct, yes. Matches closely with my initial 1.3% calculation as well.
---
Optimal work here is "Unlikely" which means there are chances he could prove he did not do it. Like if he streamed his gameplay and or recorded it. That then is proof he was not doing it. Just because something is unlikely does not mean impossible. 
---
Blackrider is Daedric Armor, change my mind
---
I want it so bad.
---
I just got to 34 yesterday and I play a couple hours a day there is some repetition but looking for the flatwoods monster and rare outfits to sell has kept me occupied lately
---
I think we do need to be able to have a way of selling items without having to do it character to character, but there are some potential issues.
---
1. If we're using the Medical Supply Machines - can anybody sell anything or is based on whoever gets to the supply machine first? If it is open to all, do I have to scroll through potential 12 (players) x 800 (stash weight) items to find what I want?
---
2. Who sets the price? How do I set the price or is it game driven?
---
3. How would perk cards affect prices?
---
4. If, as someone mentioned, we put the machines inside our CAMPS, how will people find out camps as they don't show up on the map? Would they become fast travel locations?
---
Caught Gram twice this week, once he was stuck halfway in a rock way north, the other he was just walking down the road. Both times he had no caps and nothing worth buying. The time on the road he had 200 caps for my buddy and zero for me...don't know what I did to piss him off.
---
From a materials standpoint. It seems better to diversify and be able to repair with various junk instead of a single grouping. 
---
I haven‚Äôt analyzed the numbers, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an advantage doing I a certain way. 
---
Interesting point, though I suppose it would depend (hard to really reason it out w/o knowing what kind of acquisition triggers a counter) on which account dropped/picked up the stuff more often.
---
Why did you wait till that dumb twat yongyea made a video about something that happened two weeks ago to complain?
---
Also, did yongyea inform his idiotic viewers that there is an outfit available in base game which also allows the bonus?
---
Yes part of the game that you can easily replace with a little bit of work. 
---
There is no way in hell that this person could have gotten even a hundred thousand ultracite ammo legitimately in 30 days. Not even if they played the game 24 hours a day 7 days a week for 30 days straight. It's literally impossible to do that. Rather than this bullshit sob story he came here with, he should have instead just made another account and save himself a bunch of time so he could get a head start on his next 900 hours
---
Maybe you should just chill the fuck out. It‚Äôs a video game. 99% of the fo76 community is great. You are in the 1% that‚Äôs an asshole. 
---
Let people just play the game. I‚Äôm sorry, are we all supposed to bend the knee to you, Lord Fuckwad? Most of the time people are just roaming around and accidentally enter events. As a new player, I do it all the time. I have no idea what the fuck is going on sometimes. 
---
Then there‚Äôs toxic cunts like yourself who think they have the right to dictate how people play a video game. They paid for it, they can do whatever they want. 
---
I enjoy reading all the meme replies because it makes me think that they all actually don't know what they're talking about. I can already feel the /v/ mentality of wanting another TORtanic overtaking the public image of Fallout 76.
---
It's like I'm looking at stupid people who don't know how stupid they are.
---
does the community manager usually say something along the lines of  "we've PM'ed you, lets discuss this over customer support"?
---
I have a Furious MG42 (LMG) but I've barely touched it so far because it's not a viable weapon till I unlock more mods and cards for it. 16 damage and the mag runs dry so fast. You can't even drop one level 68 super mutant with a full mag.
---
Wait Fallout 76 was panned and has a bad rep in the media and Bethesda is still banning players who want to play? Not a good PR move. Sorry this happened, really hope you can play again.
---
and i like how forgiving you are :)
---
When you pay $70 for a game, you expect to get some entertainment and engagement out of it. If that's not by playing the game, all that's left is talking about it.
---
Can't remember the quest name (Flavors of Destruction?). Everytime I threw the bait mine, it would just disappear. Was enjoying the game, bugs and all, up to that point.
---
Now I see that each patch is making the game grindier and grindier. Seen that trend before. Not gonna play another game that sinks into boosters and loot boxes.
---
Oof, someone's butt hurt. Nice job calling me a cunt, feel any better about yourself? Lmfao
---
There‚Äôs some place called Larry‚Äôs meat shop or something by the wendigo cave that always spawns 3 snallygasters one of which is a boss and they each drop 8ish acid every time just fyi. 
---
Since it uses an unmodified bullet, Two Shot then probably favors weapon types that lack strong receivers. That said, basically everything of note has a Prime Receiver, so AA should still be better pretty much everywhere.
---
Or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored with this where‚Äôs the new content‚ÄùI have easily spent over 100 hours in the wasteland I paid $60 value for money that‚Äôs insane and there is more content. It on me I spent the first 2 weeks after launch burning through all the missions.
---
he apparently cares a whole lot that plenty of other people like a game he doesn't. I'm guessing he's either a TSE whiner or banned duper.
---
Pays bills of content that no one really plays
---
My SSD boot drive is enough for now. I don't want to get dreaming too much.
---
Ballistic and Energy restistance is busted too. All flat resist are.
---
Wanna take less damage get % reduction from cavalier or sentinel. I‚Äôve got over 500BR 500ER and 500RR and still get oneshot.
---
They either need to change how the flat values work or for example for rad resist make the legendary effect be a percentage resist. Or give us underarmor with % rad resist.
---
I'll play and roleplay how I want, thanks. Fuck ya scorched Earth. Don't like it? Go play farcry. 
---
But the pure amount to craft flamer ammo vs like the 5mn is absurd
---
SLAVES OF THE CHAOS SEEK DEATH! DELIVER IT!
---
I would've bought the Mothman set but the purple and checkered pattern seemed a bit too sparse. Would've been nice to see different paints for each type of armour like the Hot Rodder stuff.
---
Lolz you‚Äôre a height requirement to do the SBQ? 
---
You are either the biggest moron on the planet or the biggest moron on the planet.  Please place whole face in front of the shotgun before pulling the trigger.
---
Any chance you can upload the rest of the new atom shop stuff?
---
so first you complain about the atom shop, then about it being "broken" now you're onto sales figures?
---
The train of thought left the station without ya, didn't it bud?
---
Hahahaha you mean the weekend event. The one that included outfits available in the game. The one that's been over and done with already, and you probably didn't even notice. Yea, you win big guy.
---
I'm not sure why a person making YouTube videos should bothef me . I'm still playing and enjoying myself and rarely have any bug issues ,I bought a power armor helmet on the aftermarket in a banged up box for a steal and gave the game to a friend . 
---
 I'm not in any rush to leave ( besides I'm really enjoying the exploring and picture taking aspect )  I'm still searching for a awesome weapon though . 
---
You‚Äôre a special kind of idiot, aren‚Äôt you? I don‚Äôt get why you shitheads even bother with watching videos or post on a sub about a game you don‚Äôt even like. Don‚Äôt you have better things to do? Probably not...
---
Well , you see , I predicted this since the 1st of January.I played this game till bout 5th-6th of January , cus by then I was absilutely sick of it and then I never touched it.Fast forward to now and I see a reddit post about this.
---
Thats what you get for playing Fallout 76. What did you think was going to happen? You were going to have an enjoyable experience? Sike! You thought. 
---
Bro I said this game is a shit show and made an entire thread previously saying fuck off to the amount of screws this Game offers. That criticism doesn't apply to me.
---
Sorry I might be asking too many questions. Can I look at your health also please? Thanks. 
---
Things have been referenced in the Atom Shop files itself long before the actual models/skins showed up in the actual game files. Im guessing thats so we cant Datamine the items themselves. Will dig a bit deeper later this week to confirm the new ones are not there yet and may attempt porting what i find in the game via Baka File Tool or try to get them into Fallout 4 again. Got the PA paint textures but failed getting the new models in during the beta.
---
Currently broken I would wait till its patched and works. Cant sneak in silos, cant sneak past scorched beasts and always caution never hidden. :(
---
people with 500 hours whining about lack of content. Like, maybe you shouldn't play like its a full time job...
---
Do you not understand how alts work? They aren't only for a single character, a single alt will be used to hold items from many different characters. He said he has 4 characters, his "mule" and the 3 characters he plays. So if you mule the ammo from his 3 other characters to that one alt that alt will always have more ammo than any of the other 3 characters as the alt with the ammo is holding the ammo of 3 other characters.
---
Which means his alt with the ammo could be holding 3 characters worth of ammo, while his main character is only holding 1 characters worth of ammo.
---
Yes.  We need a local text chat.
---
On Xbox bummer :(
---
I didn't notice , because I was sick of playing this broken game since 5th-6th January.That's why I didn't notice.Fast forward to now and I see a reddit post about this and countless youtube videos.
---
And to think I was so close to wasting 1400 points on the cartoony camouflage paint...
---
obvious you dont play this game, that shit was old news and something that real players don't give a crap about health bonus.
---
The most telling thing is his main account was not flagged for normal ammo. If he acquired it legitimately, his main would have picked it up, then transferred it to his mule.  If the high number on his mule is from transferring it back and forth few times, his main account should have been flagged for a similar, and likely a higher, number.
---
Yeah.  I have used the follow me emote and kept shooting the bag.
---
Can't all options be true ?
---
The best part is that you know it's true and your best response is trying ad hominem, sad.
---
haven't played in a month and a half and still troll this sub?  get a life...
---
The really irritating part is finding the keyword.
---
Given your set of eight letters, you have to consider all anagrams of all "Caesar shifts" of those letters and choose the ones that result in English-language words. There's so much room for error and/or oversight that the human approach isn't just time-consuming and tedious; it seems downright unviable.
---
You could get base game items which also gave the bonus. But of course those you got your info from conveniently left that out...
---
You must be a child. Most of us don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúwork‚Äù in a game after working for 8 hours. Why should I have to work when I‚Äôm the customer? The business I‚Äôm patronizing broke it, but I need to work to fix it? 
---
Picture this, you‚Äôre in McDonald‚Äôs and an employee breaks the only chair left in the dining room. He looks at you and says, ‚ÄúSucks to be you, I guess you could put it together if you want to sit down and eat.‚Äù That is what this is.
---
Rifelman here.  I have 8k 5.56 and 7k 45 ammo on me all the time.   Its the only ammo i use.   
---
I do have a stack of 3k FCells hoping one day energy guns are worth using.  
---
Are you on now by chance? I'd love to come see this for myself 
---
900 hours guy is gonna get his own sub
---
Legitimately is not just "Legitimately crafted"  Bethesda has the the ability to restrict items from being dropped in the world and traded, and restrict character weights and stash weights.  Presumably everyone was free to pickup dropped ammo or purchase it from other players, Bethesda literally build the features that allowed this.  High end characters were using ammo as a currency because it could made almost weightless.  
---
You're amazing.  We should all be lining up to S the D of such a legend.
---
Bump and upvoting.
---
No one tells me where and how to play.!
---
That being said, I‚Äôm not carrying anyone‚Äôs butt either. 
---
In the SBQ, Pull your weight, or imma loot your rotting corpses..
---
I just did some factory raiding pvp and ye, out of 5 raids against lvl 150+ players, all wins, no losses. The one shot is ridiculously broken. The bloodied handmade is one shotting better than the tse before its nerf.
---
But it's very risky, as you want to keep eating to make sure you are not too low or too high.
---
So you don't play. You're not up to date. You don't know what you are talking about except what youtube tells you. But you won some sort of prize today? Good for you. Here is your I watch someone else participate and inferred trophy.
---
I don't think Mothman is either. Most of the stories in real life portray Mothman as relatively harmless, but skittish. He doesn't really do villainous or heroic acts
---
Thank you for the info. I will keep investigating. Does it affect your AA/AP combat sniper riffle or your Instigating Bowie Knife as well?
---
yes
---
Automatic receivers generally reduce damage as well, for those weapons which have the option.  
---
Explosive suffix muddies things a lot, it's really unclear how it interacts with anything.
---
They nerfed stealth? /s
---
But how often do you think you‚Äôll actually come across someone using vicinity chat 
---
Drip feed your way to victory hahahahhaa
---
Stealth Nerf is when todd sneaks up behind you and bops you with a foam baseball bat,
---
He didn't even win anything since the mistress of mysteries outfit is base game.
---
Damn, 1 bottle on Nuka Cherry left... She could have been the record holder, but at least she died doing what she loved. 
---
and you're a neckbeard, basement dwelling nobody...that absolutely nobody would miss if you vanished off the face of the Earth...sad...
---
Lmao I wouldn't go on this sub of filthy casuals for nothing , but now I'm just saying that I predicted it correctly.Bugthestard did pu this off.
---
Yes, it does. My aa combat sniper rifle is at 293. 
---
also *cough*mistressofmysteries*coughcough*
---
TBH it could be always there but just no one found out when it‚Äôs working ‚Äúright‚Äù. And could be even their stealth nerf compound the problem and make it obvious now. 
---
There is a Arch made of rocks overlooking the Bog near the NRARC if that is what you are referring to.  It is located a little south west of it along the cliffs overlooking the Bog.
---
Heh. 
---
That's the challenge with software development, especially in games that are so intensely database-driven. Everything is connected. 
---
I‚Äôve done some calculations and others have basically calculated it at ~5 flux per hour if he was crafting 5mm or .50cal ultracite ammo and we all know that‚Äôs do able. As for the second part, someone should definitely test out the ammo transfer.. just won‚Äôt be me after 400+ hours invested lol
---
I recommended the mothman cap! 
---
Maybe some help, I saw a standard receiver for the .50 cal in the data mined changes for this patch, am going to check shortly if it is automaticaly available or if I need to scrap a few for it.
---
I agree with much of what Tybber42 says however blew it with the edit: "You seem so angry over a video game that it's hilarious".
---
Money spent out and things break or are broken. If it was food, equipment, book, clothing in real life you'd take it back and ask for a refund. As this is a piece of software you can't do that therefore it's frustrating. 
---
Then grind time. Hours of time put into building your character, collecting resources, struggling with bullet-sponge creatures then it gets taken away.
---
Me, a screen freeze up near the TOTW Ski resort but the glowing molerat that was running out of the building at the time of the freeze still killed me on the server - evidenced by having bone worms and a completely empty junk itinerary after having to "quit" the game to clear the freeze and log in again (XB1). I can't then go back and do the same again because the resources aren't there. 6 hours later, I have more or less restocked but that's 6 additional hours of human time wasted because of an issue somewhere. If this were an offline game, you'd reload your save from 20 mins ago and be on your way, no worse for wear but fractionally lighter.
---
Since P6 I get more screen freezes like this than at any time before and it's frustrating - found this post trying to see if another post about freezing already existed.
---
As FnordBear states "This is it's own strange beast" which I agree with, as are many of the Beth games, but over the past too many years you learn how to live with it by using sensible save points (and a pause button) but now it's only online, there has to be a certain expectation from the users that they should expect a good degree of stability and assurance from the outset which sadly is lacking. 
---
Yes, we could all wait for the game to "mature" but there would be no-one to find the issues and B would be cash-strapped! 
---
Survival mode is of no interest whatsoever to me, people can pretend about this now by disciplining themselves to only pick up 1 can of dog meat an hour or only drink dirty water. Having a stash mechanism to hold the same as available in foNV or 4 is what I'd want. however, both are less important than stabilizing the core code and removing the current bugs (and not reintroducing) - and a way to pay off your unintentional wanted status!
---
No idea what they're running but as of now my TSE Gauss is about as effective as a Broadsider and my Anti-Armor Gauss was even less. I just sold off my AAG and kept the TSE as a momento. All while my Lever Action is turning heads into distant plums of brain matter. 
---
People keep saying this. I run a rifle/vats build and I absolutely wreck shit. Maybe you just can't build?
---
You could always grind out Moonshiner's Shack for tick blood if you're hurting for stimpacks. Just make sure you're using Butcher's Bounty.
---
No.  My group and I were at the chemical plant.  We were dealing with the robots when two gulpers came in, and while fighting the bots and them.  They just kept healing.  Robots were dying no problem.  Just these two gulpers would not take or keep damage.
---
My instigating grenade launcher is at 593 which it was normally at 250 something
---
I can see a huge wave of player switching to unyielding bloodied build now. Lmao. This is funny. Thanks for the find. 
---
And now the youtubers are picking up the fucking scam story and running with it as Bethesda punishing their most loyal player.
---
Oh I'm not telling anyone to do anything, I just think there needs to be a level requirement of at least level 50 cause it's the endgame, big boss fight. That being said, I can't tell someone to just leave the fight cause they're not gonna listen lol. Also, I 100% agree with your last statement there
---
Weren‚Äôt people fake outraging about this a lil while ago? 
---
Damnit Bethesda, you're banning the (very) few people who actually care a lot about your game.
---
u are most likely in a popular spot so when u log into that server someone is already there
---
God fucking Damnit. The fun police found out.
---
I agree - "rebuild america" ... with communities ...
---
My anti armor combat rifle jumped from 150 to 260.
---
Where the heck are all the weapon skins? Excluding the garbage candy cane walking stick and croquet mallet, we've only seen four weapon skins, right? Two of which were limited time... A gold skin for a .44 that nobody uses because pistols are underperforming, and an overdone (less is more applies to camouflage too) woodland camo for the hunting rifle. The hunting rifle skin was kinda insulting because nobody owned a legendary hunting rifle at the time as they had only patched them in a couple of days before. 
---
I'm just sad.
---
Actually I have PE degree and work in a gym, you on other hand is butthurt fanboy who try to project yourself on the internet with ad hominem. Try harder, i'll give you another chance.
---
Broadsider are considerd heavy explosive weapons, so no there is no TSE. There is TS versions though. 
---
15 hours
---
Todd???Is that you??
---
Look at the second image, that is in the picture 2 on the edit
---
Nobody is there. I could build again same spot, 12 servers, 12 times. The spot is empty.
---
yeah but yongyea and I think juicehead ran out of clickbait to get there revenue.
---
Plays 900 hours
---
Yea, spending 9 hours a day paying the game EVERY DAY SINCE RELEASE MUST BE REAL FUCKIN BORING
---
Interesting, I have 2 anti-armor melee that showed no change: machete and crossbow, but perhaps it was just the display?
---
Good for you, man!
---
It's happy knowing that people are having fun in the apocalypse!
---
Jim Stirling just picked the story up!
---
https://youtu.be/bT8STHunM8k
---
If you're still playing Fallout76 you're just asking for a ban now.
---
Welcome to the media of today! Where we spew out the first thing that gets clicks and the truth doesn't matter.
---
Yeah, me too. With my axe. üòÇü§£
---
Hey if this guy really did play 900 hours he is your guys biggest fan, restore his account with some special rewards, send him some physical gifts as a thank you as well.
---
&gt; I bet you're real fun at parties... You sound like an opinionated snob.
---
I'm both, to be sure. You have a real nice day now, ya hear?
---
I can prove that I did not kill Kennedy with my birth certificate.
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
Every computer environment has a test environment ... some lucky ones also have a production environment. 
---
I just don't understand why he's not getting any more upvotes. 
---
Some guy who doesn't like the game comes back to whine more about not liking the game, to people who like the game, and his complaint is pretty inconsequential ...  We should all be thanking him. 
---
I played a solid 13 hours yesterday myself. I had one glitch that caused me to log where I couldnt move and one DC. Not bad at all really. 
---
Actually not true, the amount of hours he played he‚Äôd only have to collect ~5 flux per hour and that‚Äôs basically what you get from killing the queen not to mention all the nukes flora around her. You gotta understand a lot of people use heavy guns to kill the queen so 5mm and .50 cal ultracite ammo are the most commonly made and each flux makes 120, with super duper that‚Äôs 240 rounds for every flux.. just thought I should lyk people have different play styles that might be more efficient than yours. 
---
I‚Äôm not gonna do the math again here but basically all you‚Äôd need would be 5 nukes a day and to get 15 flux from each nuke which is incredibly easy, so yeah hope that informs you a little better, have a good day!
---
The solution can be legitimately found with no letters up, its just time consuming to test all the codes. We used to get 10+ people together to solve them legit on stream. Wasnt worth it anymore when people just showed up having cheated the codes.
---
If you want to know more about how it works/how it could be legitimately solved with no letters let me know.
---
One outside the Sutton station. Another in the Watoga Super Duper Marr. 
---
I'm clearly not being clear enough.
---
50 cal machine gun, two shot, with stabilizer perk: 13.98 damage per shot.
---
50 cal machine gun, armor penetrator, with stabilizer perk: 24.799 damage per shot.
---
Everything is exactly the same except the legendary effect and armor piercing is better in this case.
---

---
I had this happen to me. I dont think it has anything to do with damage. I just think the dev's dont know how to fix a game with out help from the modder community. But when the endgame content is broken why play the game anymore? Either way. Bethesda needs to get their crap together and fix the game to a playable state before releasing ANY other content. Atomic shop or otherwise.
---
I thought you owned 3 gyms?
---
In no universe can you honestly believe that Bethesda cannot look at a character and see the ammo counter. 
---
The game has to track ammo to a character. 
---
No way a developer cannot look at a specific character and see what it attributed to them at a given time, both on person and in stash. 
---
I can buy that they cannot track history, that when the game says the character has a TSE shotgun, they don't know where it came from, only that you have it... But I cannot buy that you are telling me they can't see an ammo stack. 
---
This is why Bethesda says they can't recover lost items that bugged out. They can't see if you HAD one, only if you currently have one. 
---
Think about that. 
---
They can, and they did. Dude was sitting on a unreasonably fat stack of ammo. not just ammo passing though his account that all added up. That is just some bullshit ass hail mary the dude concocted. At some point he had a literally ammo count of what Bethesda said. a point in time, not an accumulation of movement. The former is far more likely than the latter. 
---
No, I've been playing a couple hours on days both weekday and weekend, and haven't run into any nuke drops.
---
It's your punishment for having so many icons on your desktop, holy crow! /s
---
Real talk though, that sucks.  I had to do multiple reinstalls during the Beta because of hardware issues on my end, and it takes FOREVER.  Good luck, dude.
---
Console
---
It fixed mine! =)
---
That made me chuckle. Well played.
---
And I work at them ?
---
Play Resident Evil 2, Metro Exodus, Kingdom Come Deliverance, etc. Why waste your time on all the grindy online crap?
---
I got to have that professional drinker perk on all the time. Whiskey is an essential part of my build.
---
Well done mate. Item dense builds ftw 
---
out of those Blocker is the only one I feel doesn't make a difference. you're sturdy enough without it.
---
sentinel armor is essentially emergency protocols, but better.
---
Legendary Jim Stirling posted his WELL RESEARCHED and educated opinion on this TRAGEDY!
---
If you're still playing Fallout 76, you're just asking for a ban!
---
Just hang out, and wait for the flies.
---
The first letter shows up 48 hours after reset. So roughly 4 hours from now.
---
Thanks now I wonder what would be better AA with tank killer or TS with tank killer and peforating mag
---
Adrenaline reaction is working, but instead of being activated by health it is procs on hunger.
---
Hazmats over armor really would be great. 
---
Especially if in this reality we can wear dresses, grognac costumes, military uniforms, and bobbleheads over top of armor. 
---
Agree, that is odd. Not sure whether it means the main account never touched the generic ammo or whether they only did a deeper dive on the secondary account (as they've described their normal scan, it doesn't look for non-rare stuff like generic ammo, even if you have an impossible amount of it).
---
Considering it's considered the endgame, big boss fight, yeah, I'm asking for a level requirement cause low levels (in my opnion) have no place in a SBQ fight. They'll show up anyways, which is really annoying and stupid, which is why I think there needs to be a level requirement
---
The vast majority of players who call out Bethesda on their bullshit are long gone (I only pop here once or twice a week since I‚Äôm subscribed to this subreddit).
---
Three days ago I got into an argument over some guy claiming FO76 has probably been the victim of a coordinated ‚Äúcorporate espionage‚Äù from competitive AAA publishers. It‚Äôs insane (I‚Äôm pretty sure he meant corporate *sabotage* but not expecting much from a guy who believes that TakeTwo Interactive hires trolls so RDR2 could compete unabashed in October 2018).
---
Companies make mistakes all the time. Especially on the IT side. Bethesda has claimed that they have no automated system to catch duper‚Äôs. This recent ban wave was probably done manually by looking at data dumps exported to spreadsheets and looking at accounts on the extreme end of the bell-end curve. The 900 hours guy got flagged and we‚Äôll never know if he duped or not (he had mules and people on this subreddit do equate that to automatic duping).
---
It‚Äôs become crazytown in here. The FO76 is the perfect example of how toxic and damaging fanboyism can be to a community.
---
Nice, now all I need to do is figure out how to stop hoarding so I can wear PA other than Excavator all the time.
---
It's a good article, shows the dangers of being addicted to video games. No one should be playing 900 hours of a single video game in such a short amount of time, what a waste of life
---
I fully expect to see my YouTube feed filled with near-identical videos about the "news". I won't name names, but you all know the YTers who simply read gaming news in a dramatic tone for views every day.
---
I used it, and tested it on a scorthed beast a few minutes ago. 16 shots, a few were sneak attacks, say 20 shots all together, normally this weapon would take 40.
---
Well looks like i gotta be starving all the time then :) 
---
Well I guess I'll stop grinding for that Martial Artist/Gattling Gun build. Which was to replace my grenade/explosive build. :|
---
Uh, you might want to reread the email they sent him. The email does NOT say he has that much ammo, just that in a 30 day span that much ammo went through his inventory. Which is why this is the issue, because the way they are unable to see where it comes from or if it is the same stack of ammo you put on an alt ends up causing to count multiple times towards that 100k limit over a 30 day span.
---
Interesting, I'm thinking we need to kill one of each to get credit then. 
---
Stay hangry!
---
Also 2 in Watoga Municipal Centre. Next to the benches in the room with the large ramp up to the hole in the ceiling.
---
His cap pool is tied to one of the factions. 
---
I gotta be honest, we both only have like 5 hours of gameplay (just started this week) so I hadn‚Äôt even considered that. Thanks for the tip!
---
Soooooo, you're laughing about how the game is getting massively bad press about the wave of bans? 
---
Its a shitshow.  But its still fun if you can figure out all the work arounds and why things sometimes snap and others are randomly intersecting or floating.  Management of mats will be difficult at first but you will figure out how after some frustrating hours.  Hoarding is a thing of the past.
---
&gt; but I am saying that is your Occam's razor answer.
---
Clearly you don't know what that means since taking Bethesda's word at face value instead of misconstruing it to mean the "easier method" ***is*** the "Occam's razor answer."
---
So there are good reasons we should not be able to wear legendary armor under our hazmat suits. 
---
From what I understand, the gamma gun does not care about the -15% damage reduction from Sentinel armor. If people could wear hazmat suits over full Sentinel armor, then only certain builds would actually be able to kill one of these players. You would be forced to use power armor or weapons that stagger. Someone, like myself, who uses automatic pistol criticals would never be able to kill a Sentinel armor user. I carry a gamma gun all times for this reason.
---
Also, all clothing worn over armor is cosmetic. They give no damage resistance. Hazmat suit trades damage and energy resistance for near radiation immunity. If it acted as clothing, there would be no reason to wear anything else.
---
Jim Sterling even released a video where he spends most of it bending over backwards and sucking an exploiters dick, despite having no actual evidence to the contrary of Bethesda's findings except for the banned users testimonial. It's honestly embarrassing.
---
I made my own thread discussing that two shot/anti-armor can be better or worse depending on a number of things:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ast5yf/psa\_antiarmor\_and\_two\_shot\_are\_betterworse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ast5yf/psa_antiarmor_and_two_shot_are_betterworse/)
---
Other than the ones at the agricultural center, are there any other ones easy for sub lvl 10 players to get?
---
AHAHAHAHA! I just came back to a game I totally don't play, just to tell you "I told you so" about something that didn't happen!
---
Suck it noobs!
---
I know it's been a few days but I can say warframe is definitely a game that rewards the type of dedication you seem to put into games. I've put almost 8,000 hours into the game at a similar rate you put into FO76 and the avenue I chose to spend my time is trading and amassing collectibles, connections, and premium currency you can only get trading with other players if you don't want to spend real money. So if you're looking for something where you can go full hog and have your effort actually rewarded, I think Warframe would fit you pretty well.
---
I do truly hope they don‚Äôt just nerf melee but make you need screws and springs for your damn handle on Meelee so you can play the real junk recycling 76 simulator 
---
I don't like PvP interaction due to spawn triggers. Spend 30 mins sniping high level ghouls, mutants, scorched and lazer-faced assaultron only to have them respawn when I'm right in the middle of the location and me running (or trying to whilst over-encumbered) away, then having to trudge back to camp to make more ammo just to do it all over again.
---
The ability to see the other users lets me know the level and therefore the likely respawn level, and areas they are likely to frequent. It's not about the grinding spot approach (BizzyBum) but the desire to be left the heck alone by everyone - I'm happy to be a loner. Only every had a companion in FO4 when it was a quest necessity otherwise I was the lone wanderer!
---
Alright
---
&gt; Money spent out and things break or are broken. 
---
Not all of us think the game is broken or as so often stated, unplayable. I can get on. I play for anywhere from 4-14 hours with friends. Sometimes we have disconnects, maybe 1-3 depending on how long we are playing.
---
We do everything in the game. Build camps, finish quests, do challenges, events and more. 
---
Sometimes we run into glitches or bugs that don't allow us to complete a quest, or loot doesn't appear on a dead mob. Sometimes we get crappy loot. 
---
But the game plays and we have fun. We don't care if we didn't get loot now and then. There will never be an end to loot. We've died because of glitches like you've described. 
---
The thing is. We don't feel a need to rant and rave about this over the internet. 
---
And we paid for this game just like you did. I've reported lots of bugs and glitches. Through the channels they have set up. 
---
See the difference. The game has bugs and glitches. But so far, none of them have stopped me from playing the game, or even been so frustrating I had to step away from the game. Because it's a game. That's all. I paid $60 for it. 
---
&gt; Survival mode is of no interest whatsoever to me,  
---
Everything after this doesn't matter. Because this sets up exactly what you are saying. You only care about that which interests you or matters to you. Everyone else's views don't matter. There are lots of people that want Survival mode. I am not one of them. I have no problem with them putting this out there before stuff I am interested in. 
---
He never possessed that much ammo. The game counted him as having picked up that much ammo from trading a lot less than that back and forth with his mule account. 
---
Hmmm, considering we have one preview image each, and each is a different base armor...I wonder if this will be a single "Pack" of skins with each only applying to the previewed armor.
---
Looking through his twitter he's also an Anti-Vaxxer, so he's comfortable with ignoring the truth.
---
There was also a winter-y flamethrower skin in a bundle if I remember right.
---
Cool, I meant that perhaps my display showing unchanged damage was inaccurate. I did not test them in use.
---
What shows the second ranged weapon Nerf?
---
Get this shit to the front page
---
Can i get this weeks powerball numbers? Maybe try playing again without so much bias, you shouldnt be this worked up over a game. The Bethesda is evil horse is long dead and been beaten into a fly infested meat pile thats disappeared before it could be looted and no amount of complaing or told you so's is going to get us that wood left leg back.
---
I kinda wondered what those were for this whole time.
---
Does not take time.  
---
They accidently removed one keyword, that's all,'they just need to add it back 
---
Oh man, I hadn't thought about that. This place will be *more* insufferable for the next few days between the YT posts, and the "see, I'm vindicated" duper posts.
---
Apologies if this was already mentioned: Before the patch, the floor for effective SPECIAL after debuffs was 1 and now it's 0. For the sake of pure curiosity, is this a bug or a deliberate change?
---
All of these people are shifting the argument with a Red Herring. You are right and I recall countless arguments over this in the past. The game is basically dead now which is why it isn‚Äôt bigger news. Paying for power in games with PVP has always been an issue in the past and it still is an issue in popular games now. Especially if it went directly against what has been stated by the developer and repeated by fans ad nauseam. If there were something similar in Apex Legends tomorrow every gaming news outlet would cover it with negative attitudes. 
---
Wasn't that just the one and all teammates needed to be in different outfits, meaning 3 atom shop purchases were needed for the full possible benefit?
---
I don't see it as OP being wrong, just that OP's point doesn't matter. Sure, it's kinda shitty marketing and technically violates what they said, but there are so many things BGS has fucked up on that this barely deserves a footnote. Much less OP's excited ITOLDUSO!!11eleven
---
When the game was announced I was skeptical. Fallout 4 to me was a huge letdown and when 76 came out, I waited. I kept hoping that all the screw ups on Bethesda's part were honest mistakes and would be isolated. I was wrong. They way that Bethesda have handled this game is pathetic and the game is irredeemable to me. There is absolutely zero chance I will give Bethesda money when they intentionally released a broken product and the slew of negligence with their game. I have completely lost faith in this company. I have no hope in ES6 or Starfield. Bethesda, once one of the titans of the video game industry, has now become nothing more than a rat.
---
God forbid they make it an actual game setting or something
---
Expect to have to spend at least $20 on each lol
---
No one argued against that
---
I wish special mattered more in general. I put 15 into intelligence as soon as I could. It's supposed to help with crafting but I can't craft more items. Just a slight durability bonus.
---
Autism or not a cheat is a cheat and you wish death in them right ? Brun that little demon like his missing genes 
---
Pass the popcorn. This should be good.
---
Step 1: crouch
---
Step 2: headshot
---
You're welcome, grasshopper.
---
I've had something like that before...previous owners generators were still up and running so when I took over it was alot more in caps to claim
---
and this is how they get away with this. 
---
You could maybe get around this with drinks like canned coffee which give you a 200 AP boost but yeah it‚Äôs not really viable
---
Ah sorry man :/
---
Are you trying to sneak past enemies? No killing? You are better off just running away.
---
You use Escape Artist, so there should be no problems getting sneak attacks when detected. Even with this stealth 'bug' people complain about.
---
Jeez, Bethesda. Poor guy was just enjoying himself some Fallout 76.
---
Thanks, let me know what you find out. Much appreciated.
---
The thing is a story about "Guy gets banned for cheating, he denies it but he likely was" isn't that interesting of a story. "Bethesda f%\^ked up again, wrongfully banning one of its most dedicated players" will get that click bait they are after. 
---
Top notch journalism either way &gt;!sarcasm!&lt;
---
If I could get hold of a couple more Bolstering Sentinel pieces, I'd drop Blocker for sure.
---
Had no time to go through the curve tables yet. I will report if I see anything.  
---
On another note, hey /u/Aten_Ra. Nice to see you are still around. Keep it strong.
---
YONG DONG IS WRONG
---
Agreed 100%!
---
Mind me asking how you get to 500RR? Trapper with RR secondary?
---
lol do you like bans ? Only thing you can do better is add ur gamer tags  lol
---
Yes, it's very noticeable, especially with slower guns.
---
Rebuilding my character for the third time isn't interesting.  
---
I had a beauty unarmed build that just fell right off for end game, so I built into another of the offered viable builds.  Then they made that not work.    
---
So I'm stuck either moving back to my melee cards which I just respecced out of, or being gimped.  
---
I would have loved to stick with unarmed, but alas, the game forces PA.
---
Or it could be that their cheat detection is broken. A bit like how every game they've released since Morrowind has been broken.
---
yeah that's worth testing.
---
The wild card is the stagger you get from tank killer.  If you will miss that, then keeping tank killer makes sense regardless of the small damage change.
---
If you used XP glitches, I'm going to hazard a guess.  If it was at Morgantown HS disarming grenades and you did the triple bouquet.  Over several characters, that would get you easily to 100k.  Bear in mind, the email doesn't say total at once.  It's how much of that item passed through your account in a 30 day period.  If you made 5 chars and ground them all to 50 doing this XP glitch, you've easily hit threshold.
---
Wtf did you do for 15 hours ? I‚Äôm highish lvl and can‚Äôt find much to do after 15 mins ...
---
blade of bastet is a weapon. you want weapon's artisan. fix it good is for armor.
---
Yep, agree as an example can‚Äôt remember 100% but think Brotherhood FIELD Scribe Uniform goes over no problem (one with backpack) and the Brotherhood Scribe Outfit (no backpack) unequips any underarmour... Bethesda‚Äôs logic..!
---
It's not a MMO to start with. It's missing the massive part. Also why shouldn't people be level 200 or 1000? It shouldn't be tedious to change your build or level up cards. Making it tedious drives people away. There should be fast and easy ways to get a lot of XP and level up fast.
---
&gt;He could have very easily "tricked" whatever mechanic is keeping track of the number of items obtained by transfering large amounts back and forth between mules.
---
AFAIK this hasn't been confirmed by a reliable source, only people speculating.  To me, it doesn't make sense that they'd be tracking that many transactions for thousands of players. The simplest answer is they ran a scan when they went through to delete duped items, flagged the &lt;1% of accounts that were obviously duping, then banned those accounts.  
---
Again, I think that's people just trying to spread misinformation to confuse the issue here.  The honest truth is this guy got busted with hundreds of thousands of difficult to craft ammunition. Whether he actually duped or not is irrelevant as he was obviously being fed by sources that were cheating.
---
&gt; Especially after they failed to properly merge branches and then pushed a  version of the game that brought back old bugs into production mere  weeks ago. 
---
What does one have to do with the other? The guy stated clearly that he indeed had that much ammo on his character, which was identified correctly by Bethesda. He's been adamant he acquired it all legitimately, not that it wasn't on his two accounts.
---
It does. Legendary effects don't matter.
---
There's a visual bug where once you over-repair something, it won't display the second bar until you look at it again. just scroll to a different weapon and back and it should be there.
---
There's some seriously dark stuff in there too. It's an interesting world!
---
You probably the only other person who will see this post.  ^_^  Not even worried.  ^_^
---
Believe me, in trying to take it up with them as much as I could. I literally only PvP, so me picking up over 100k anything is absurd for me
---
Yer it‚Äôs called to be fixed hahahah , on a side note you could just go meelee ?
---
The numbers are completely feasible, it will be interesting if more information is released regarding it.
---
The War Rider skin makes me think of the Bullet Farmer from Fury Road for some reason. *SING BROTHERS, SING! SIIIIING!*
---
Were the others wanted?
---
I'm no programmer either, so I'm not sure how that would effect overall stability.
---
I know they're worried about the increase to even 800, so I think any other additions to the item pool would be more for them to deal with.
---
And the logoff with items in containers others can access is an issue.  That's where duping came from.
---
All inventory is 'stored' on bsg servers.  It has to be or else every time you changed servers you'd lose everything.  Therefore bsg can determine how many of each item you have at any given time (given the time/effort to make it happen; which they did).
---
It sound like a bunch of dupers (or dupees) are trying to sell some bs to get out of a ban.
---
We've done the numbers on another thread, those pro and con.  
---
It's actually about a weeks worth of effort, assuming some of the raw materials are traded for, it's actually quite easy to have those qualities.
---
Plague Marines incoming!

To your posts men!
---
I've seen a major drop off.  I think the TSE nerf started it.  Then the loot tables getting screwed made it not worth the effort.  I need like 10 stable violet flux too.  I have everything but the raw ingredients.  Gonna take me forever at this rate. 
---
It is unless someone lock picks it and steals the contents. They get a bounty of 5 whole caps. 
---
I get your points, but I disagree that they are good reasons.
---
First off, Sentinel is a broken outlier - my opinion only, ofc. That also needs a balance fix, but I do see why you would call it out, and your point is very valid with the current state of the game.
---
To your second point though, about trading DR and ER for radiation protection - no. Power armor has no such trade off. The only downsides of power armor are a UI not everyone likes, slower run speed, and the inability to use unarmed weapons.
---
If I am going to spend hundreds of hours farming and trading for a "perfect" 3* suit (I have no such suit, FYI), then I want to use it and be beating the pants off the power armor guys who put in no such grind. That's kinda the POINT in this stuff being end game.
---
Hope this came across the way I meant it - I am debating, not attacking :)

Turns out websites talk about whatever generates the most clicks, not whether or not they defend cheaters.  All of you going to see what they said are just making them more money.  They see the trend, then write more nonsense just to get clicks.

No, just other low level players. It showed up on his screen as a quest and after he put the supply drop in... he heads that way and goes to drop but nothing was in it.

On the map there were two others heading directly away.

It was just a regular drop the other two players were like levels 3 and 4.

Surprisingly, acid is not the bottleneck one would expect, especially if steel is farmed by scrapping weapons and junk. The acid requirements are only around 250-300 per day, depending on ammo type, to achieve 366071 rounds of Ultracite ammo in 30 days.  
---
You're right that Flux is the hardest component to acquire but it's actually the Hardened &amp; Glowing Masses and High Radiation Fluids that are the bottleneck, not the Raw Violet Flux (especially with Green Thumb). Every time you enter a different server you can re-farm flora. One need only use the chat mod to find queen or Whitespring nukes or simply server hop a few times until you find one that has someone in a silo or an already active nuke site.

---
Uh, you might want to read the email they sent again if you think it said he currently had that much of the ammo. It doesn't, it said that character acquired that much over a 30 day span. Not that he currently has that much. Which doesn't go against what I said above. 
---
The game has been out for only 3 months and people are already high level and have their gear maxed out. 
---
If you can‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs a problem in a game where balance is key (any multiplayer game) then you‚Äôre part of the problem.

Right, but no bounty showed up either. Figured it was a bad loot drop deal...lol

I told him to get use to that now...ha!

Then maybe we will get weapon skin one day ?

In order to renew the 10 years old skin we hardcore fallouters still use in this brand new game ?

Basically what happened, is supply drops can be stolen before you get to it. This is to force players to be raiders and PvP. If I see a supply drop I wait until the owner gets their loot, and if someone unlocks it and becomes "wanted" I kill them before they loot anything out of it.
---
&gt; I cannot think of any reason to have that much ammo. Not one.

To sell to other players on Ebay and such.

This should have been included at launch. Such an important and core feature. Being someone who never ran out of caps and didn't know how to spend all 25k of them, I would love to create dozens of quests in hopes that low level people can undertake them.

Eh, depends on the situation. I spent all night last night with quickbooks support telling them that a specific account was having server side problems, and they kept pushing off escalating the ticket, constantly saying "We'll figure this out!" doing stupid stuff that I knew wasn't going to work, and constantly forgetting what we'd already gone through. I just got high in order to not get too enraged.

Came up regarding the post "[An ammo calculation for duplication](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ascdn9/an_ammo_calculation_for_duplication/)"
---
The Author was off by 60%+ On what fluxes could be collected every day.
---
I've personally made 250+ Violets in a day, with a record of 350, spent doing nothing but server hopping and collecting in the SBQ Area, you can collect 120'ish per hop, and I'm using 2 to 3 accounts, so every 20'ish minutes I was previously collecting between 300 and 360 raw.

As a result I always gave away thousands of rounds away at a time, usually when a new player bought (or was gifted) a weapon, and since "Black Tuesday" I've been dumping tens of thousands of rounds every couple days, so most of these numbers were in the hundreds of thousands previously.
---
It's also doable with a week's worth or insane work to likely craft that amount of 5mm Ultracite ammo, if that was the goal of a hard core player running multiple accounts, so spread out over time is also inside the range of possible.
---
Oh gotcha, so you're saying you do have to literally come up with a potential code based on the nuke code pieces and then just try them until you get one that works. Wow that does seem tedious. I **am** interested in how to decrypt the nuke code pieces (I have all 8 for silo alpha for this week) myself. We could chat via PM or Discord or whatever really.

If we can‚Äôt nuke the starter zone then low level characters shouldn‚Äôt be allowed in the SBQ fight, I‚Äôm glad you haven‚Äôt had the experience of wasting thousands of rounds of ultracite ammo cause low levels don‚Äôt do any damage, but it definitely happens and with the SBQ being one of the only end game contents then I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable for it be lvl 50+
---
Yes it is... AA is better all around than TS.
---
The alternative is to have each world generate its own nuke codes. Can you imagine spending the time to track down all 8 code pieces for a silo all in one session, since there's no way for us to connect to specific worlds? Maybe once they introduce private servers, then they could all have a unique code because you could control which world you connect to.

Tested myself with a furious combat rifle, Watoga robots, pixel-counting screenshots and the assumption that the damage formula has a 1.365 exponent. I'm pretty confident with the 30% max value, although the 5% per shot is less certain.

I did the same test on Perforating magazines and got the correct result (someone data-mined it later), so the method should be good.
---
I have the explosive affect on the flamer, but no two shot...dont think they drop those anymore...read that a while back...anyhow, its a fun weapon, but weak as hell given the cost of ammo.

From the beginning of hearing 900 hours, my brain instantly went to "i bet he was probably automating lots of things to get those hours".

It is not hard at all to setup a simple script to load into a server at a fast travel point, then run to a specific spot that has, for example, an ultracite node to mine. So basically you can have a script to login, run to an ultracite node and mine it, logout, then repeat x100 and let it run hours to stock up on items/mats(which are later duped for more). If you want to make it more advanced, you could have it target legendary mobs only, and if they dont spawn or the char doesnt find them, it just server hops.   
---
This is ALL JUST SOMETHING I MADE UP btw, please nobody spread this as some fact or anything lol, this is just a scenario that could be possible.   
---
Some people dont understand how these things work, so all of this might seem a little ridiculous to them....but when your duping items and selling them for RL currency(and making GREAT money!), its always good to have a variety or things to offer! ;) 
---
That'd be great.
---
I know eventually we will have more variety but right now it's not interesting when you roll up on someone's camp and it looks basically the same as everyone elses.
---
So you haven‚Äôt played for over a month and a half , yet you make a post bashing the game...hmmmm 
---
Yeah, a gift box opening emote would be awesome.

I am willing to argue with Obsidian fanboys about the quality of Fallout 3, and even some of 4, but that doesn't mean I'm joining the Bethesda cult either. This game is bad, and the devs are clearly running around like headless chickens trying to salvage it.

Don't think you know the meaning of the word shill to be honest.
---
&gt;A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, politics, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means.

I think it‚Äôs called car henge or something just a big circle of cars and some skeleton in a chair with beer in the middle

Yes, they immediately become wanted after picklocking. A lot of high level players steal from lower levels because they can't do anything about them stealing. Nothing of real value to high levels in those crates anyways, like seriously.

I see that. I just think That the one time it should be a PvP free zone is in a nuke zone. I'm not knocking PvP. My husband and i have begun to nuke random spots on the map for fun. It is interesting to see the different zones.

They're still actively updating, and there are great things coming. There is a LOT to take in, but some beginner guides can help, and typically if you go on Twitch and hop into a streamer's channel to ask some questions, they're super willing to help out.

---
/u/YaBoiDannyTanner I've confirmed all of this behavior in-game with my Lever Action, so hopefully that works for you. There are some cases where I do think Two Shot may be superior, but it's relegated to rifles or weapon types that have automatic receivers where the gained effective damage from Two Shot is actually higher than 25%. I would need to see a Two Shot Automatic Combat Rifle against a regular Combat Rifle on paperdoll or something similar to know for sure.

Why would his mule character be picking up or crafting ammo? Doesn't it make more sense that it was all acquired on his main, then transfer to his mule, as he stated? If so, the math doesn't add up.  The simpler explanation is that either he or another play duped the massive amount of ammo, then he had his mule character pick it up.  Which is why he has crazy amounts of ammo on his mule, and only slightly less crazy amounts.  
---
His "dropped/picked up" theory also doesn't account for the question of why you would constantly be transferring so much stuff back and forth, back and forth...which again, would've led to a more even distribution between him and his mule, since it's a zero sum. If he crafted 1000 ammo on his main or mule, both go up +1000 during a transfer.  You wouldn't see a gap of hundreds of thousands. You would've also seen the exact same ammo types listed for each character.  
---
So you see how none of that makes sense.  Not to mention the simple fact that Bethesda's servers would have to be storing and tracking EVERY item EVERY time it was moved, and somehow incrementing a counter specific to each character in the ENTIRE game.  That amount of processing would bring the servers to a crashing halt.  
---
The simple answer is the real answer. Bethesda ran a scan of the inventory database during the downtime last week when they eliminated the duped inventories.  This guy was one of the &lt;1% that was busted with huge amounts of duped items, and got banned.  Ockham's Razor is a thing for a reason.  Everyone's ignoring the simple answer in favor of these wildly absurd and crazy theories.  It's also strange that very few, if any people are bringing similar examples that would lend any sort of credence to the "pick up/increment" hypothesis...and of course, the only guy who's presented such a hypothesis is the guilty party.
---
Where did he state he had that much ammo? Everywhere I saw he claimed at max he had 36k ammo at any one time and the email they sent him didn't say he currently had that much ammo, just that that much ammo had been acquired on that character over a 30 day span.

I walked from Watoga to Camp Venture by way of all the fire bases and came across 3. All three attacked me (or fought back after I attacked them).

Thanks, everyone, for the great answers to my Q.  I got a lot of good tips about WS too!

It already makes you immune to "submerged radiation" but not normal radiation so it's not like it made sense to begin with.

So I can make Labrador tea with it? Is that a variety of Mutant Hound?

Pretty sure I've seen Radium Rifle very often at Watoga/BOS/Harper's Ferry (one of the three).  I keep wondering if I should buy it every time I see it.  Never bothered though.

Duh but oh well.

That is ridiculous. There has to be 'win' in p2w. What do you win in a week with, say, even +60 HP? That's like saying murder and trespassing are the same category of crime.

What they figured was that much ultracite ammo means that he duped a lot of flux, because there is no way a human could get that much otherwise. 
---
Not impossible, check the comment above, and remember transferring between mules would count against the total, so if he moved it from one to another..

Don't spend IRL$ on Ebay or Amazon for something hyped AND dont Bounty Hunt when you dont understand the game mechanics.

Same thought. It did get me a little hopeful on what they have planned on the game. It looked pretty cool on the inside. The videos on YouTube did not do the area justice.

"Come here' has failed more than it's worked for me.

 That skittishness you're referring to.  The last one jumped servers!  
---
No, p2w means that you can pay for a advantage...

Do you hear yourself? 
---
Jesus, splitting his time between 3 characters makes it even more impossible that he farmed enough items to make that much ultracite ammo.
---
I'd say he got a little bit ahead of himself.
---
This just makes me grip my AA Exploding lever action rifle even tighter after I found it sold off by some schmuck to some vendor because it wasn't TSE.
---
&gt;Actually not true, the amount of hours he played he‚Äôd only have to collect \~5 flux per hour
---
Sure, as long as you ignore the time required to gather the materials for the other 650,000 rounds of conventional ammo....and all his other gear...
---
Again, the claim is utterly laughable, and we don't even have the backend data Bethesda does.
---
Could they be wrong?  Sure.  But his story is repeated over and over again by cheaters in every online game.
---
It sucks the Bethesda changed a game mechanic that makes Perk Loadout Manager no longer functional. The Mod author is trying to put something together but hasn't yet. :(

If a player below 5 gets wanted does pacifist mode turn off? Like can they be killed?

Say I give you $1 a day for 30 days. At the end of 30 days, I would say you acquired $30 of the course of 30 days.  That's what Bethesda email said. He's twisting the words around into some absurd theory that Bethesda was somehow tracking every single item that was picked up or dropped over the last 30 days, which is nuts.  Bethesda also said themselves that they were running scans, looking for unusually high item counts...And this is exactly what happened.
---
&gt;though I just considered it interesting that a so-called "journalism" website would get drawn in by something as silly as Reddit drama.

Ghouls are my main glitch Everytime a workshop has ghouls to kill they're just floating diamonds and u take ghost damage from these diamonds....

I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. Those effects modify different things and you have to calculate the damage all out for each effect separately, which it appears OP did in his post. Can you explain this with math of your own?
---
If Beteshda was a company that released decent content it wouldn't get so much shit.

Bitches be [thirsty](https://i.imgur.com/otTY9QW.gif) for damage...

Most of the ban replies I have seen have always cited ultracite ammo and always involve trading for 0 caps or picking from a bag rather than crafting. As mentioned they might have done it and don't remember but they did do it. Beth has started doing temp bans as they realized that too many are getting caught up in the bans
---
Another post also did the numbers breakdown, ignoring the vanilla ammo because it's completely trival, I've had close to a million rounds myself, if the base ammo type was 5mm it's actually completely doable, in fact not that hard for a multi-account player, assuming Bethesda is double counting the ammo (OP claimed it was a transfer)
---
i like all these ideas, but what i really want is a bigger CAMP budget. maybe 25% extra would be perfect.
---
Definitely agree. I‚Äôm all for supporting them, but those prices could use a 50% cut at least. I‚Äôve been banking atoms and haven‚Äôt spent them for fear that a limited time item is going to pop up and I‚Äôm not going to have the balance to acquire.

I do have the healing mutation but that only works when not in combat.

Tried to reenter PA, reloading etc.., there is also a bug when reentering your Excavator PA the carry weight drops 100 pounds (Excavator has 100 extra carry weight and with 2 calibrated shocks even 200 pounds).

If you get any bonus for giving extra money to a game it is pay to win. Sorry man i love fallout too but a broken promise is a broken promise. We need to stop it here in its infancy so later they wont give any bigger bonuses later like more game breaking ones.

Boohoo someone has no life and plays more than me and they know the game better than me and are higher level and have better items. Strawman fallacy based on some hypothetical about killing the SBQ in 3 shots. By the way someone was able to do kill the SBQ fast solo without any duped weapon. Wasn't even legendary. They didn't use any exploits. They just understood the game better than you. They had a good build. 
---
I can have the most powerful build in the game at around level 50 if I plan it carefully. I can buy any weapon from the marketplace, duped or not with the caps I acquire in that time. I can make that time as fast or slow as I feel like. I don't care about your sense of balance. People who put the time into the game are more powerful than people who don't. That is the case in just about every MMO that ever existed.

Dave Ramsey would be so proud of this comment! Seriously though, bank that shit.

I did some of my own research calculations and my conclusion is that anti-armor is generally better than two shot but not always. Sometimes the difference is negligible (if there even is one). Given that two shot also adds recoil and spread I think that makes the weapon slightly worse. Long explanation below but short version:
---
‚Ä¢	Both bullets of two-shot need to hit to get the damage boost but the two-shot prefix increases recoil and spread so there's a chance you don't get this damage, in which case anti-armor is better
---
‚Ä¢	If you compare two exact weapons that have no damage increasing mods then two shot (assuming you can hit with both bullets) will edge out anti-armor pretty much every time... probably 100% of the time.
---
‚Ä¢	If you put a mod on your weapon that increases the damage substantially, there's a pretty good chance that anti-armor will beat two shot, depending how much damage you're adding
---
‚Ä¢	Smaller bullet damages seems to do better with anti-armor than with two shot
---
‚Ä¢	Larger bullet damages seem to do better with two-shot (except when they don't because of mods and stuff)
---
Maybe someone wants to run a wider array of bullet numbers against DR than me... I think the answer is varied depending on the numbers you use but I agree that anti-armor is generally better:
---
Explanation:
---
" +1 projectile. +150% spread. +100% recoil. "
---
"...The two-shot variant of the weapon takes the base weapon damage with mods, and adds the base damage without mods in the paper damage (listed damage). When firing, this damage value is halved, and each projectile deals half of the total damage. If both bullets hit one target, it only uses damage reduction once - treating both projectiles as a single shot..."
---
Important factors:
---
- The second shot is %25 modless base damage
---
- In order to get maximum damage, both projectiles need to hit their target (they are then treated as one)
---
Math experiments (calculating the damage coefficient and then multiplying it by the gun's paper damage):
---
Weapon with base damage 100 and 50% armor reduction against 185 DR (SBQ):
---
.5[(100/92.5)^.3653] = .51x100 = The bullet does 51 damage
---
Two shot weapon with base damage 100+25 for Two shot (where both projectiles hit) and 0% armor reduction:
---
.5[(125/185)^.3653] = .43x125 = The bullet does 53.75 (the game would round up to 54)
---
Two shot seems the clear winner in this case... but let's look at some other scenarios. Let's say the weapon is modded to give it an additional 25 damage.
---
Weapon with base damage 100+25 from a mod and 50% armor reduction against 185 DR:
---
.5[(125/92.5)^.3653] = .56x125 = The bullet does 70 damage
---
Two shot weapon with base damage 100+25 from a mod+25 from Two shot (where both projectiles hit) and 0% armor reduction:
---
.5[(150/185)^.3653] = .46x150 = The bullet does 53.75 (the game would round up to 54)
---
Oh snap... now anti-armor is better!
---
For fun let's run some other numbers... let's use the same modded weapon and calculate DR at 400 and DR at 50:
---
Weapon with base damage 100+25 from a mod and 50% armor reduction against 400 DR:
---
.5[(125/200)^.3653] = .42x125 = The bullet does 52.5 damage
---
Two shot weapon with base damage 100+25 from a mod+25 from Two shot (where both projectiles hit) and 0% armor reduction against 400 DR:
---
.5[(150/400)^.3653] = .35x150 = The bullet does 52.5 damage
---
Wow, what the fuck is that shit? They both do the same damage???? How am I supposed to pick a side if they both give the same number... some mathematical BULLSHIT... what about 50 DR?
---
Weapon with base damage 100+25 from a mod and 50% armor reduction against 50 DR:
---
.5[(125/25)^.3653] = .90x125 = The bullet does 112.5 damage
---
.5[(150/50)^.3653] = .75x150 = The bullet does 112.5 damage
---
The same number again? Stupid bullshit
---
Maybe the problem here is we're using conveniently large numbers... what about smaller arms? Let's look at a weapon that does 20 bullet damage:
---
Weapon with base damage 20 and 50% armor reduction against 185 DR:
---
.5[(20/92.5)^.3653] = .57x20 = The bullet does 11.4 damage (we'll say 11)
---
Two shot weapon with base damage 20+5 against 185 DR:
---
.5[(25/185)^.3653] = .24x25 = The bullet does 6 damage
---
Wow, two shot sucking balls up in here, what the fuck. I won't even bother calculating mod damage here. This DR is ridiculous though maybe, let's try at 50 DR?
---
Weapon with base damage 20 and 50% armor reduction against 50 DR:
---
.5[(20/25)^.3653] = .46x20 = The bullet does 9.2 damage (9 really)
---
Two shot weapon with base damage 20+5 against 50 DR:
---
.5[(25/50)^.3653] = .39x25 = The bullet does 9.75 damage (10 basically)
---
Damn, now two shot is better again... fuck this shit.
---
Conclusion:
---
Math is fucking lame but based on my limited results I think we can ascertain the following: Two-shot is better than anti-armor except when it's not and anti-armor is always good, except sometimes it's not as good as two shot. 
---
Not true, some bulk weighs the same, some less.

Also queation how do i get a title like you with the brotherhood?
---
That's your made up definition. Refer to my other comments on this thread.
---
I hope they are not limited time. I travel a lot and would hate to miss them.  
---
My point tho is that you can collect close to 30 if not more stable flux in an hour which leaves lots of time to gather/trade for those other mats. And I consistently gather 8k+ normal rounds of ammo in a day and I don‚Äôt play nearly as much as the 900 hours guy. Just a little disingenuous to say it‚Äôs impossible when things like trading exist aswell. Anyways not really trying to argue just inform that it‚Äôs more than do able and actually makes sense profit wise. 
---
Edit: I always drop excess ammo at peoples bases and he was real involved with the community so I wouldn‚Äôt doubt if others did the same at his base. 
---
Cant confirm but mine breaks way too quickly and while using weapon artisan on it, it just disappears from from workbench menu...
---
What? You keep getting stuck on this idea that he actually has that much ammo, he doesn't. That is the point. He wouldn't have to farm that much ultracite because the way BSG is counting the ammo coming into your inventory when you use alts it gets counted multiple times.
---
Do you hear yourself? You are so stuck on this idea that he is for sure guilty you are ignoring every bit of evidence that goes against it. Many people have already explained to you multiple times how the email says he just had that much ammo go through his inventory over a 30 day span, NOT THAT HE CURRENTLY HAS THAT MUCH AMMO. 
---
So defaulting back to "well you couldn't farm that much ultracite to make that in that time" doesn't work because he never had that much. 
---
I am sorry that you seem to not understand how the same ammo could be counted multiple times even after modders of this games engine has explained it multiple times. 
---
He didn't have to farm that much because he didn't have that much ammo.
---
It defaults to the opposite way you want it, yes. It was meant to be like an indoor checkpoint to your private room or a section of your house visitors are to be kept out of. With some finagling you can get the door to face keypad side out (technically backwards). Basically the way I got it to snap in was to go inside the house and attach it as if I'm leaving, tricking the game into thinking I'm making it an interior room. 
---
Not only is it pretty cool looking, unlike regular front doors you can break into them, you have to knock the whole thing down. Much greater cap bounty for someone determined to break in. 
---
And this is why I've given up... All the crap you gotta wade through just to get to the enjoyment of the game... and they do crap like this to make it worse...
---
Friends were the thing keeping me going in this game... I met some really great people and had a great time.  But EVERY single patch drove more and more away because they'd fix a couple of things and totally fubar more than they fixed.  This has been happening far too regularly to be anything but utter incompetence on their development team.

First off, that definition is not off wikipedia, and also that's not entirely what p2w means. LISTEN TO ME, if you can spend money for a advantage that is p2w. Yes, you can get it for free, but you also have the option to pay for it if you dont want to get the atoms yourself, or get the mystery dress. I don't care if it isn't significant, its still a advantage you can pay for, that simple.

There is 5 ish parts, the robot waves become larger + more intense the longer you take in the silo, so try not to loiter.
---
The first section you need to make and program a keycard to allow you through a laser grid.
---
The second part is destroying servers or going through a lvl 3 lockpicking door to bypass some more laser grid doorways.
---
The third part you gotta fix some pipes, kinda like the powering up a powerplant event, that shuts down another laser grid door you to go through. Use your PA for this part as you will take rad damage.
---
The fourth part you have to remove and repair a bunch of servers (repair on a tinker bench) or you can also find a few in the silo, to repair a door control and open said door to get into the launch room.
---
The last part you have to protect some bots that are doing all the launch calculations and such, from other bots. One of your bots getting destroyed isnt the end of the world, as it will just slow the launch process til a new one replaces it.
---
Set aside 60 ish minutes your first run, I can usually solo it in 30-40 mins if I dont get lost. Bring lotsa ammo / perk for armor pierce against the bots.
---
Always bring 2-3 cards with you too, entering a wrong code or taking too long to enter a code will eat your card, so always bring a spare or two.

I'm quite enjoying this sub's conniption fit over this. Despite the fact that Bethesda has mismanaged virtually every aspect of this game, the white knighting here has been ridiculous since beta. 
---
So the way that daily works is that you‚Äôre sent off to hunt and kill three random types of creatures. After you kill them and complete the quest, you‚Äôre given a buff that lasts one hour that gives a slight damage boost to the types of enemy you killed for the quest

Poor guy. It doesnt matter if you win by an inch or a mile winning is winning. 60HP can do a lot if used right. The cosmetic items sold did give a stat bonus. If you added that 60 with adrenal or any bloody weapon then thats more damage from that bonus hp. Use your head op. 
---
Lmaoooooooo
---
Well my understanding of your OP was that higher lvl characters shouldn‚Äôt farm in areas like whitesprings because we are somehow hurting lower lvl characters experience. My point was that it‚Äôs a shared world and no one has the right to tell others where or how they play. And to be frank the sooner people like you realize it‚Äôs a shared world the better off it will be imo, lower levels do not own the rights to these areas, they are shared.
---
I really appreciate the back-and-forth and theorycrafting here! Following some testing and conferring with other folks on their testing, I actually just updated the OP with my most recent findings. AA is still better than TS (or I would've struck out the OP, actually), but not by as wide a margin as I originally purported.
---
The most important factor here is that Two Shot is consistently using the unmodified base damage for its +25%, which comes out on average for bigger guns to around ~19% bonus damage. This results in AA still being consistently stronger, especially considering the behavior that TS experiences with its increased recoil and spread.
---
There's only one case where I think Two Shot might actually be better, and it's for rifles that have Prime Automatic Receivers. Basically, I think Two Shot will actually do &gt;25% damage in that case, but I would need to see the paper doll values for a TS Prime Automatic Handmade against a regular Prime Automatic Handmade.
---
I don't see why not
---
If you have a fist weapon equipped before getting in PA, itll break alt weapon switching too. (Been that way at least since patch 3).
---
After you get in, fist will unequip like its supposed to. After You can manually select two different weapons in PA, but it wont remember the new choices, D left will switch once, then the 2nd D left will tell you you cant have this equipped in PA. 
---
"I just had this equipped you F***ing idiot!!"
---
Don't encourage him!
---
He needs a long break, not being sucked in again.
---
lmao!
---
it's not remotely possible to ONLY farm the things needed for Ultracite, the requirements to drop the nukes are so time intensive that he'd need an entire crew feeding him nuke drops so he could do it.  Also, super duper only triggers about 1 in 3 crafts.  Not only that, the articles about it state he had more then 300,000 ultracite ammo in total.  
---
Dude is full of shit.  He cheated and got burned for doing it.

I‚Äôll definitely keep this in mind. Thank you.

Based Bethesda banning players having fun with the game instead of actually fixing the problems. I STILL have consistent crashes and horrific frame rate issues on my PS4. Is Bethesda ever gonna fix those issues? Probably not, it's easier to just continually gut your playerbase instead.

Might be a tie in to the Horsemen themed stuff. Babylon personified was the Great Whore and Mother of Abominations in Revelation.

Yes. I have a couple of times got stuck in a bad game state, where the game is still playable but there are no active quests shown in the pip boy data tab, and no quests on the screen. Not sure about cause, but at least once it correlated with also getting stuck in power armor temporarily, and the player model getting bugged out. (basically had a "hollow" power armor model where all the armor pieces showed but the chassis itself was gone.) I think I needed to restart the game to fix this.  
---
Should note this was 2 or 3 patches ago, haven't seen this for a while.

cool math... that doesnt make a weapon spawn anymore or less in my game. 
---
 I think that was patch 1. I could be wrong too.
---
Power armor costs fusion cores to use. Hazmut suit has no cost to use. Power armor breaks certain perks that require no power armor to use, like Ironclad for example. They are two radically different options for radiation resistance.
---
Sentinel is not broken as long as you have a gamma gun. Any player, regardless of build can counter sentinel armor simply because you cannot wear a hazmat suit over it. If you could, then it would be broken.
---
Also, power armor has way more weakness than that. They are loud as hell, easy to hear coming, a huge target, and are stunned for three seconds if they fall 5 feet. They have terrible mobility and a huge cost in materials and perks in order to use effectively.
---
If you want to not die in a hazmat suit, use blocker, Suppressor, lone wanderer, serendipity, dodgy, and/or cola nut for a 600 HP fast heal.
---
Have to read my testing... I had numbers all over the place. Though I think anti-armor is probably better than two shot 7 times out of 10.
---
ive been playing with this build right after the tse nerf. I used to get hungry loads of times. This never happened before. 
---
That math shows it's literally impossible in all scenarios except being fed resources and playing non-stop for 12 hours per day with no breaks and no downtime.
---
Wah.  Don't buy it.  Leave the rest of us alone.
---
Has anyone proven that it won't?
---
Yeah. When you hear raider and think ‚ÄúTheir camp must be SO badass‚Äù but its really a house with no threatening feeling. (Unless you have a deathclaw or some other pet)
---
Hey, atleast we got a crayon kindergarten skin
---
Yeah I think it's just one. Just killed a Mirelurk Queen today, didn't register :\
---
"Through Magic and summing of the PC Master Race God, Gabe Newell. ***NOTE: NOT CONFIRMED".*** 
---
That makes 3! Half-Life 3 is confirmed!
---
I have no under armor...
---
Can you add base prices to those weapon locations as well. It would be really helpful to know how much they cost.
---
The way I understood it is that they have different classifications of junk.
---
Originally there was normal junk (that can be manually scrapped, caught by scrap-all, and auto-scrapped when crafting/building), and protected junk (can be manually scrapped or auto-scrapped when crafting/building). Mods, and bulk junk were originally considered protected junk. Their fix to protect mods from being scrapped when crafting/building involved making it so protected junk couldn't be auto-scrapped when crafting/building. They also added hardened mass to this category. Bulk junk was left in, which is why we had a period where bulk junk could only be manually scrapped. The hotfix for that was to put bulk junk in the normal junk category. That gets us to where we are now where mods are still protected, but bulk junk in your inventory gets caught by scrapping all junk. To fix that and keep mods protected, they need a new category that acts how protected junk used to, where it was auto-scrapped but not caught by scrapping all junk. If they just add the keyword back, it either won't auto-scrap or mods will auto-scrap again.
---
It sounds like a particularly easy fix to make, but they've got lots of different things they're working on and this isn't anywhere near game-breaking so it's not a high priority. It'll be gotten to, but it's not like it's particularly bad to deal with. Just keep your bulk junk in your stash and it'll be fine.
---
I was curious about the healing mutation, a few people, myself included are having issues with something (the mothman?!?) Keeping you in a caution state, which means less healing effect.
---
The excavator bug has been that way from awhile now, if you log in while wearing it you get an extra 100lbs carry weight, once you get out and back in you loose that extra 100 til you log back in wearing the suit.
---
Im not sure what else it could be, ill pop back to this comment if I find anything out.
---
Well thats your opinion. I and many others enjoy it
---
I‚Äôm still hoping for Responder signage for my safehouse C.A.M.P.!
---
I've had that too. Sometimes I like to go see who's at "my" spot when I login. Most of the time it's no one. And no one in the area üòí
---
Yep, Mine's in the same location currently, though I built next to it instead of around it.
---
Don't miss out on the 2 ballistic fiber items next to the creek.  Added bonus (assuming you'e always as short on that as I am).
---
&gt;That math shows it's literally impossible in all scenarios except being fed resources and playing non-stop for 12 hours per day with no breaks and no downtime.
---
Interesting - that's how you interpreted it?
---
So, just an observation, I dont think it was a nerf so much as correcting what looks like it had been a cut'n'paste between 10 and 20%...the curve is just that now, a curve and not a cliff. And yes, I do have/use adrenal reaction 
---
Don't BS me. You mean to say murder and trespassing are the same crime and should be equally punishable? And 60 HP can do a lot? A lot of what? And 99.99% PvP happens in Power Armor, which would override your outfit, removing your Pay to WIN 60HP HUGE STAT BONUS.
---
No mods, put custom ini in anyway, still doesn't display atomic shop items. Im just Uninstall/Reinstalling at this point.
---
Guys a pos
---
Fireproof is a PvP nerf to explosive(non-legendary, non-TSE) weapons. Which then got nerfed again with Demo Expert changes.
---
Sometimes a buff is a nerf as well. Not saying you are wrong, just that you also aren‚Äôt 100% correct.
---
Yep. I have killed a SB and done Queen of the Hunt, no joy.
---
Yes it‚Äôs all about sensation and clicks. Math is boring and too complicated for the masses they are not gonna bother verifying anything. 
---
Step 1: Equip highest damage silenced weapon you have; Step 2: Modify your weapon for Improved Critical or ideally Superior Critical, not increased Damage or Superior Damage; Step 3: Crouch; Step 4: Headshot.
---
Have they fixed the bug yet!
---
I'm the fucking snowflake? You're shitposting about being sick of reading complaints, by people who are sick of bethesda doing things that make the game less fun, in various ways. 
---
Your post is the problem. Your point of view is the problem. Criticism is not acceptable, and criticism by people who are emotionally invested is even fucking worse. 
---
Your post is pretty fucking clear, dude. 
---
Yup - this is a reoccurring theme for me. Literally chase folks down through Flatwods trying to give them stuff...every now and again someone will have mic enabled and I can talk to them and explain why I'm following/stalking them.
---
have you tried shooting at Banfunsda yet... they are a pretty big something or other lol jk  
---
its bugged, sigh.. I'm in the same boat...
---
I'm kinda bummed that they didn't put anything Parkersburg related in the game, considering it's one of the bigger cities. There was a pre-release map put out online with points of speculation, and the blogger apparently thought Fort Boreman was happening, but it ended up being something else. Point Pleasant is about the closest to home for me in the game.
---
Calibrated shocks
---
This nerf seriously hurts melee characters who use it.  It may hurt melee more than ranged, tbh.
---
No, it wasnt, look at the "curve" they were correcting what looks like what was a cut and error between last couple rows..
---
&gt;Say I give you $1 a day for 30 days. At the end of 30 days, I would say you acquired $30 over the course of 30 days. 
---
That is one way it could happen yes, as is the way I stated. We will use your money analogy as well.
---
Say you give me 1$ a day for 10 days and I save that all up and then have 10$, I then take that 10$ and put it in the bank and then later I pull 10$ out of the bank to buy something, but I decide I don't actually want it so I put the 10$ back in the bank. Now with the way the email is worded 20$ has gone through my pocket over that 30 days, even though I only ever had 10$ max.  Now say that I pulled it out a couple more times and put it back, that 10$ now looks like 40$ by the way BSG is counting it up.
---
I don't know what you mean about him twisting their words around, I'm not going off what he said, I'm going off what BSG's email they sent him said.
---
As for them checking what items you pick up? YES of course they do, otherwise the items wouldn't be saved to your inventory on log out. They absolutely keep track of what you have picked up and such. BSG has even said as much in the Inside the vault where they talked about being unable to tell which items were dupes and which weren't.
---
BSG is able to see what items you've picked up, what they are unable to see is if the item is unique, where you picked the item up from and if the item is or isn't duped(this is all info directly from bethesda themselves).
---
If you read the email it states specifically that "This character was found to have acquired over 100k of an item over a 30 day span." It does NOT say that they currently have that many of said item, just that that many of that item was picked up by that character. Which means that if you have say 30k ammo and you drop it and pick it up with an alt and then the alt drops it and you pick it back up with the character that dropped it first that character will show 60k ammo and the alt will show 30k ammo for each of those characters in that 30 days, now if you do that 5 times, that means the main character will show 150k ammo over 30 days being acquired , and the alt will show 120k ammo over that 30 day span being acquired. 
---
All this info I am using is coming directly from bethesda themselves, either through the email they sent out to him and inside the vault posts they have posted in the past.
---
yep. killed a scorchbeast, deathclaw and grafton monster (like 5 of them) and nothing.
---
It also took WAY more than 5 building materials to complete that quest.
---
there were no Nerfs to PA in code, look for yourself [here](https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/v1.0.6.0.html)
---
Honestly didnt even realize we didn't have this.
---
I totally agree with this now!!
---
Everybody has a testing environment. Some people are lucky enough enough  to have a totally separate environment to run production in. 
---
&gt;Dev Note:  
---
&gt; The ability to contest a claimed Workshop is intended and encouraged behavior as part of Workshop design. This change should prevent situations where a Workshop owner could prevent others from attempting to contest it without becoming Wanted by destroying something or picking a lock to reach the Workshop.
---
Am I missing something or did they fix the exact behavior your are talking about in this patch? (Not that having them display as red still wouldn't be a nice change)
---
Wow, why are you wasting all dem comedian skills here when you could be making millions on the stand-up circuit.
---
All weapons are affected.
---
you wouldn't laugh if you worked in IT and realized this happens more than you think, unless youre amazon
---
I am also 3hrs away and had never even heard of the Green Briar. I wish they would have included Huntington in the game. I wanted it to be littered with psycho and other drug paraphernalia, haha.
---
I'm okay with just Camden Park and Hillfolk (Hillbilly) Hot Dogs though. :)
---
For me pure OCD and masochism kept me going.
---
I have to have all the crafting unlocked - one plan and 10 mods on the radium rifle short. Otherwise I won't feel sweet sweet closure.
---
The fact that they put the plans on the bots containers out of the blue almost broke me... hundreds of hours and thousands of motion-assisted servos for nothing... but I keep going.
---
Barbed Walking Cane I will find you dammit! I will!
---
Once I do I will just quietly retire until that time when private servers are a thing and I don't have the Zenimax overlords breathing down my neck telling me how much ammo is OK to have or how do I have to play and what shit from other people I have to put up with.
---
Did you kill a Mirelurk Queen last week? I am thinking it is the animal that wasn't killed last week. 
---
Are there any areas where a Queen consistently spawns that is easy to get to or a low level Queen if one exists .. ? That is one I didn't kill last week, so I am hoping if I kill one it will register.
---
I‚Äôm taking a break and getting lost in Subnautica 
---
Ok as requested going to point out a couple data points that are important.  
---
-The "900 hours guy" multi-accounts like I do, which means more possible storage.  
---
-Before the "Black Tuesday" total carry weight Nerf many of us stockpiled resources, for example I had close to if not in excess of 1,000 bulk lead, hardened masses, several hundred thousand steel and cloth etc.    
---
-Multi-Accounting means double, or in my case TRIPLE the loot when farming one location continuously.  
---
-When Farming WhiteSprings post nuke, properly done for 9 hours I personally **using three accounts** would gather in excess of 20,000 pounds in a single run, and have in excess of 250 of the Hardened Masses, Glowing Masses and High Radiation fluid.   
---
Post weight Nerf I did a Nuked WhiteSprings and hit the weight cap no less than (4) times in 2 hours, and the next day when I scrapped down I had more than 10,000 steel, 6,000 cloth, and that's from Glowing Ones that drop very little non-Legendary equipment.  
---
OP did SuperMutants more than nuked WS's, using the same logic he would likely have a minimum of**FOUR Times as much**, and as much as 10 times as much, while also gathering gunpowder.  
---
-When mining or harvesting **DOUBLE** at the very least the calculations of what can be gathered, because he has (2) accounts.   
---
I've personally gathered up to 120 raw Violet (x3 to account for all characters) in about 20 to 30 minutes and then server hopped to gather more for an entire day and made 250 to 350 Stable Violet's in a single day.  
---
This can't be done in the same way now due to the weight cap, but was previously vey easy.  
---
-Completely remove the "Vanilla" ammo from the equation.  
---
Not only is ammo commonly used as a currency when trading items... 
---
I've had close to a million rounds of a single type of ammo in the past, I play a melee character and for about 6 weeks, before I quit bothering collected every round and dropped them off.  
---
Even with commonly giving out a few thousand (up to 20,000 5mm to a single guy once this is what I have left on one mule.
---
Since "Black Tuesday" I've been dumping tens of thousands of rounds every couple days, so most of these numbers were in the hundreds of thousands previously.
---
Ok, firstly, people can say whatever shit they want, there's no legal consequences, and your angry vitirol is just fucking moronic.
---
There's no feasible way to have the amount of ammo he did.  The entire fucking game playing community would need to feed him a string of nuke zones to make it work, he'd have to constantly server hop to get back into nuke zones, and there's simply too much demand on the plethora of materials required for ultracite ammo.  This is ignoring the fact that the articles state (granted as an offhand comment from him) that he had multiple types, meaning it wasn't all .50 or 5mm which produces in big stacks.  The people suggestings it's possible consistently miss parts of it, like super duper only trigger at 30% rate, the needed time to drop a nuke, the need for basic ultracite as well as all the shit to make flux stable, the fact that farming flux takes you away from the farming of the other things, there's a shitload of data that tells whatever theoretical maximum is suggested as being possible is not actually in any way feasible through play.  I have to guess that if a whole community was feeding him his nuke drops that we'd already have heard from them.
---
I don‚Äôt think you take into account thinks like workshops not to mention the role playing dynamics of this game. Some people are traders and thus have access to mass quantities of these items with little to no effort. Also clans and discord groups play a big part in reducing the hours spent grinding these materials. Just think it‚Äôs a little disingenuous for you to look at it so linearly. 
---
I can repost the math I‚Äôve done in other posts but you can just find them if you want, crafting that much ultracite ammo and looting the regular is easily do able and I‚Äôm sorry if your playstyle doesn‚Äôt back those facts up but its true. 
---
I‚Äôm not claiming he didn‚Äôt cheat btw because I don‚Äôt know all the facts, just like you even tho you see to want to pretend you do. I‚Äôm just responding to the bogus claims that he couldn‚Äôt have all this ammo without duping, because those aren‚Äôt supported by the data but hey if I need to do the math for you I won‚Äôt because I‚Äôm hungry. Peace!
---
I've been struggling with this every time -_-
---
Well its the stealth nerfs that are causing the bugs
---
It's not multiplying twice.
---
The equation is used to find a multiplier. The equation requires base damage. The answer will be a multiplier. The multiplier is then applied to base damage.
---
You can look up the formula if you don't believe me.
---
So, you finished everything and uninstalled after 1 month, meaning you uninstalled back in December.
---
And yet you make posts this month, last month, about in game issues you had.
---
So can you honestly answer me a question?  Did you really uninstall the game?
---
I had a melee and rifle set as my weapons. D left from rifle to another rifle..wtf...D left again and I'm punching things. Glad to know it's not just me
---
Technically you are correct, it isn't a fix. It is a temporary workaround until they fix the actual bug at a future date.
---
I am in the Enterprise Software Services business and temporary workarounds are managed as a BAU (Business As Usual) activity by the BAU teams or even Business themselves, depending on the nature of the workaround.
---
The problem Bethesda is facing is that instead of releasing a game that works in the majority of cases they released a game like other companies release enterprise software and now they have to take the whole world on the treacherous journey of managing software post go-live.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the Product or Delivery Executive on this product came from an enterprise background since all the stuff they do aligns with how enterprise software is managed.
---
Again not defending FO76 and personally I think they have their work cut out for them since this is a game and not an enterprise piece of software where you as a user of the software is paid a wage to use it.
---
Bitch flies away from me before I can pose with him.
---
*You take a swig from your Vault 13 Canteen, your stats and S.P.E.C.I.A.L have now been reset*
---
Haha it‚Äôs all good, no fucks given, they‚Äôll learn eventually 
---
Pacifist mode simply protects you from initiating PVP and you're hard to kill outside of PVP.  Becoming wanted puts you into PVP on your end so you can be hurt but still not hurt others.
---
Same .. I am wondering if it is the creature that didn't get killed last week. When I loaded in today, I saw ticks next to all the creatures I killed last week except one.
---
Yeah, you are living in fantasy land.  Everyone I've seen doing math on it ignores 2/3rds of the requirements.  IT's not feasible, and the fact you think it could be tells me you don't know the game very well.
---
I have just hit 30 too. It's be great to team up sometime and wander the wastes together.
---
That‚Äôs disappointing. I‚Äôve never completed that quest
---
Literally none of the mods you mentioned would work on a server-based game, because you're only modding your client and in the case of 76 the server controls camp placement/resources/budget. If and when Bethesda allows private servers that might be an option, but while they own the servers you're limited to mods that impact client behavior.
---

---
Looks like a stealth nerf
---
my first battle with SBQ was the most intense battle ive had in the game
---
My suggestion does not involve increased Stash size, or placing Items in world containers, if each player was limited to 20 For Sale Items, there would never be more than 240 player items available to purchase even if every player on a full server was at their limit.
---
Negative news is clickbait for revenue.
---
This is what the internet has come to, only thing we can do is find out where they live murder them, i mean inform others about the faux news &amp; dislike their videos.
---
If you did any as a team or didn't get the killing blow on any, do that one again.  Go to the challenge, then to the right of it you'll see the list of ones that counted for you.  Pick one that didn't and do it again by yourself to be certain.  This challenge is not bugged and worked for everyone I know, after we realized we couldn't do it together.
---
Why Bethesda needs to break something in every patch?
---
I like to compare Deathclaw Island to Blennerhasset Island, minus the big house that's actually there. Location wise, it checks out.
---
Ahh... someone who relies on personal attacks because they lack a logical argument. 
---
I often forget that attempts to engage online gamers in intelligent discussion is involving them in a batt6for which they're wholly unequipped. 
---
I agree that he likely never had that much ammo at any one point. However he did acquire that much ammo over a 30 day period.
---
He is guilty. No doubt about it.
---
He was injured off work 
---
Yeah, you seem to be right. And Pale doesn't really have a Pestilence OR Famine feel, so it must be Conquest. Fallout 76 seems to be going for it's own unique mix of four.
---
OF COURSE IF FAMINE ISN'T USED ON THESE, THEY SHOULD USE IT FOR EXCAVATOR, RAIDER, OR ULTRACITE ARMOR.
---
You don't even have to complete it, just go to abbie's bunker in the mire and there will be a password for Raleigh's Bunker, enter his bunker and the schematics will be on a counter in his workshop. Super easy stuff man!
---
&gt; I've completely all of the quests, pretty much done everything in about a month of playing
---
&gt; LOSING ALL HOPE COMPLETELY!
---
These two things kind of contradict each other. I mean if you finished everything the game had to offer at this point, i'd say you got your moneys worth. And getting your moneys worth really doesn't fit in with "LOSING ALL HOPE!"
---
I mean I could understand if you said, I finished everything and now I'm disappointed there's still nothing new months later, that would make sense.
---
I mean it sounds like you enjoyed the game by finishing it all so why the dyer "I'M LOSING ALL HOPE?" It really comes off like you're just wanting to join the hate train instead of wanting more of what you enjoyed.
---
I thought doing one hit kill damage to anyone required that person to be shooting back...
---
Obviously people should be cool when doing the nuke zones, but online games attract asshats and that's just the way the internet is.  I expect it to happen, but have been pleasantly surprised that it has not been.
---
 This is a question of numbers. These numbers are affecting the game. Thats all it has to do. You are calling it murder. Bethesda said they wouldnt apply ANY kind of p2w and this is a kind of p2w. I dont care how you play or what you wanna call it. Black and white. They lied. 
---
I came across the Wise Mothman near my camp, I thought because he was level one I was going to get some easy ballistic fiber but i was wrong!
---
YES but "76" this time \^.\^
---
Wooow, I knew it.
---
These community managers of Bethesda don‚Äôt know shit, thank you. 
---
For those who don't know this is a quest line in Fallout Shelter.
---
It's so nice that the game isn't built for twats like you.  Go play the latest shooter dipshit.
---
Hold my beer.
---
Yeah that especially applies to PC Gamer nowadays. I've been a reader of theirs since the 90's when I would regularly get their magazine. Now I refuse to visit their site since it's almost entirely garbage clickbait shit and their reviews seem to have made a direct turn towards the angry joe youtuber style of review where they just shit on any game that's an easy target. They read like reviews written by someone that hates video games. 
---
No one is running a modless gun against the SBQ, they're running with at least a Hardened or Prime receivers or something similar, both of which make the Two Shot damage gain closer to 19%.
---
Like, for instance, in your example where a gun hypothetically deals 20 with a receiver to 50 DR, you omitted the receiver component. One important note here is that **Two Shot is always as good or better than AA if you don't mod your gun**. Since basically anyone that cares this much about the game's math mods their guns, I don't really think that's useful.
---
Will do my friend
---
I thought the same thing. I was engaged with my immediate enemies and didn't even pay attention to the 12 other people around me. 
---
I just got the excavator limbs, not looking forward to the flux grind
---
There, it is, thanks!
---
One was giving me evils outside just outside Clarksburg earlier.
---
The base damage of a single projectile here is 100.  The gun's base damage is 125, but that is 1.25 shots at 100 each.  The base damage for the multiplier is the total damage/the number of projectiles  125/1.25 = 100.  Otherwise you are multiplying in the 1.25 twice.  If this were true before the nerf, the number would be 200, so 200\*200 = 400% damage and we all know that it was 200% damage, not 400.  It was 200\*((100/300).366).5. Now its just 150\*((100/300).366).5
---
Yeah so do I? I'm not shitting on it lol
---
Na man, gotta hop on that karma train CHOO CHOO
---
Long as it's not SBQ go for it.  That is the only nuke zone fight folks care about low levels on.  
---
Thank you, this is great info. Many people struggle with the idea that other gamers can be operating at an entirely different level than what they are familiar with, and this helps to demonstrate that.  
---
My calculations here are (obviously) very conservative. If you take the area under the curve between my calculations where someone such as yourself operates, it's straightforward to see that a nonzero number of people could be legitimately exceeding the 100,000 "rare item" limit with ammunition, even the Ultracite variety.
---
No I just think your playstyle is inefficient and that you don‚Äôt socialize on the game enough if you think collecting that amount of mats is a fantasy. But hey we‚Äôve all got our opinions, note that you haven‚Äôt actually shown me any math to disprove my claims, I haven‚Äôt shown you any to prove mine mainly because I can‚Äôt be bothered to write it out again here but also because I dont think you actually want to have a good faith discussion.  I think I know the game pretty well having played it for close to 500 hours but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve resorted to personal attacks definitely strengthens your argument a lot. Have a good day!
---
Faction-specific decorations of all kinds would be great additions! I play my main character as post-scorched-plague Responder, so having their signage to make my C.A.M.P. an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù safehouse would be really great.
---
Dont force yourself to play it or ask someone to give you reason to continue playing. Its just not your game. I stopped playing Battlefield 5 . Haven‚Äôt looked back. 
---
In a normal scenario with a reliable company I would agree, but your first 3 words says it all....you assume blank is logged.  That's an assumption that would usually be a logical assumption,  but Bethesda has done very few logical things with this game up to this point.
---
To name a few to illustrate my point, Bethesda wanted people to write essays about why such and such was wrong,  thought it was hilarious it was absolutely asinine, Ban those people and move on.
---
Bethesda has released a game that is still unstable after months with no proper Beta cycle where the game was fixed and delayed until fixed.
---
Bethesda released a glass rum bottle inside a plastic bottle at 150 dollars looking to capitalize with horrible products.
---
Bethesda did the same with numerous IRL products including the collectors edition items which were cheap and overpriced.
---
Bethesda said they would ban people with 100,000 or more of rare items such as bobble heads, this high number was to ensure it was beyond anything possibly obtainable without duplicating the items to make sure they did not mistakenly ban people.  They then turned around and banned someone (the 900 hour guys email shows this) for ammo, something that is obtained in 30-180x the rate of items like bobbleheads, and while ultracite ammo is inherently rare,  the number of it that predicates someone should be banned should have been high enough that it could not possibly be obtained in that time.
---
The reality is the ammo should have never been Included in the rare list or if it was should have been done so in significantly higher numbers to balance it to the bannable numbers of items such as nuka colas.
---
Last, Bethesdas replies to anyone that has been banned states they have "aquired" over 100,000 of said items "over" 30 days.  It does not in any way nor does it even imply that they currently have that number of said items.  This implementation of item tracking is Inherently flawed in that it does not account for movement of items (if you saw a bag and hit collect all and that bag had 100,000 quantum nuka colas you would be banned as well).  Even if you noticed that you accidentally hit collect all on the bag and collected items that you only knew were duped once you saw them in your Inventory, you would be banned for having acquired over 100,000 of said item over the 30 day period, even if you immediately dropped those items.  If you never used a single one of those duped items you accidentally collected it wouldnt matter, the game has now logged that you had acquired that amount and you would be banned.
---
Then you would be on here complaining that you were wrongfully banned.  And everyone attacking you would be wrongfully doing so.
---
While I think most of the people claiming their innocence are just lying because they are mad they got caught.  I strongly believe that the method Bethesda has chosen to find and ban exploiters was flawed in its implementation,  and because of this they should evaluate each claim of a wrongful ban.
---
If you missed the point its simple,  they created a net that may or may not also ban innocent people, that is unacceptable period.  The people who do not see that here are unwilling to view this issue without bias and are not capable of logical debate and understanding of the issue at hand.
---
I can't even fathom having 20+ of any food item without expecting half of it to rot.

Which with the way BSG counts ammo the ammo could have been the same stack of 25k ammo muled back and forth a handful of times, which isn't against any rules and not proof of duping.
---
Look at it like this, say you give me 10$ and I put it in a bank and then later pull it out of the bank to buy something but decide not to buy it so I put it back in the bank. I do that 4 or 5 times, then by the way BSG is calculating "acquiring" things I had acquired 50 or 60$ in a 30 day span even though I only ever actually had 10$ I just put away multiple times so technically I "acquired" that 10$ 5 or 6 times. Thus causing me in their eyes to have acquired 60$ even though I never had more than 10$.
---
No one cares what you think moron.
---
That's literally what they said they've done, and why they now go to escalation. Customer service really depends on the specific thing you're working and who's calling. If I'm calling Comcast for an issue, I usually know exactly what the problem is and want to report something on their end, so I don't want to deal with first tier people who are reading a script that includes basic troubleshooting that I've already done, because I've already done it and figured out their DNS is bonked or something.
---
So something really odd happened just today, me and a friend were playing and I turned invisible for him, but before I relogged to fix it we noticed that we were both seeing DIFFERENT MOBS, like we were in a group on the same server but in a different phase from each other
---
What the heck is this?
---
Shitty journalism in general for maximum clicks. Sounds like the verge...
---
Make one in your camp?
---
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself
---
You aren't invested enough. No, don't nerf melee. Buff ranged. Nerf damage resistance. 
---
We're not arguing different things here.
---
No damage perks affects the chainsaw, sorry.
---
It just doesn't have the necessary keywords.
---
Only the repair/scrap/durability perks - both temporary from magazines and permanent from cards - affect it and just because it has the 'ObjectTypeWeapon' keyword.
---
There's been like a dozen. The woodland camo for the hunting rifle is just fine, not "overdone" at all. I use the gold .44 all the time, it's still one of the best non-single-shot pistols.  I use the fatman and minigun skins as well (I've got an instigating fatman, and an explosive minigun) on my heavy weapon build.  
---
Just because you don't like something doesn't mean others share the same opinion or that "nobody uses" it. 
---
1. 12 players (Max) with a 20 item "For Sale" limit, they could also separate it by Player, so that only one person could have access to a particular players inventory at once.
---
2. Player selling the Item sets the price, listing shows player ID, you could message them in game to negotiate.
---
3.Not affected by Perks or SPECIALs
---
4. No machines in CAMP, just designate Items in your STASH BOX for sale.
---
Yeah, don't do this. Just let the person know exactly what happened. If they say they can't assist you, ask them if a Senior Agent can.
---
When I am leveling a new character I use chainsaws from 20-50ish.  I usually go through about a chainsaw an hour or so of regular combat.  When a chainsaw gets to about the 130-140% mark for durability I scrap it and equip the next.  When I go through two chainsaws (around two hours), I server hop, make the four location hop around usually getting 2-4 additional chainsaws and keep going.  If I am having a hard time hopping by just dropping to main menu and back on (more common since they did something to start making you jump back onto servers you left) then I jump to someone on my friendslists world or switching to another character for 5 minutes, take a bathroom break, get a drink, or whatever and then try again and this usually gives me a new world to look through.

That Black Rider kinda reminds me of a Chaplain from Warhammer 40k Space Marines faction.

Hey I'm on ps4. Could I buy that off of you?

&gt;If you get any bonus for giving extra money to a game it is pay to win.
---
IIRC there was (at least) one outfit already in the game (free) that provided the same bonus as the the paid superhero outfits.
---
&gt; Power armor costs fusion cores to use. Hazmut suit has no cost to use. 
---
Not a factor. They're ridiculously easy to farm. So much so that I keep Batteries Included slotted because they're heavy.
---
&gt; Power armor breaks certain perks that require no power armor to use, like Ironclad for example. They are two radically different options for radiation resistance.
---
That's not broken, they're working as intended. You just don't need them with PA. Ironclad is not a radiation perk, but I do get what you mean here. They're just not needed in power armor.
---
&gt; Sentinel is not broken as long as you have a gamma gun. Any player, regardless of build can counter sentinel armor simply because you cannot wear a hazmat suit over it. If you could, then it would be broken.
---
Man, cmon. I am assuming you have full sentinel? It could be argued that all of the prefixes are unbalanced and broken, but whatever. I agree that Hazmat over sentinel would be an issue for BOTH dedicated pvpers that play.
---
&gt; Also, power armor has way more weakness than that. They are loud as hell, easy to hear coming, a huge target, and are stunned for three seconds if they fall 5 feet. They have terrible mobility and a huge cost in materials and perks in order to use effectively.
---
Loud? Who cares? Size of the target doesn't matter to a VATS user, so I assume you're thinking PVP again. The stun can be cancelled if you know how, and it's 0.5 seconds, not 5. The material cost is MUCH lower than normal armor if you swap in the right perks. Mobility is absolutely a non-issue. Sure, a non-PA will move a bit faster, but it's negligible. Unless PVP. Can I ask....is this all of a sudden a PVP thread?
---
&gt; If you want to not die in a hazmat suit, use blocker, Suppressor, lone wanderer, serendipity, dodgy, and/or cola nut for a 600 HP fast heal.
---
Yes I know this stuff. That's not the point. Here it is, just in case it was missed:
---
Players who have spent time building a non-PA legendary suit should not be forced to remove their bonuses because resistances are broken. Fix the resistances, or allow hazmats over legendary armor.
---
Simples.
---
Yeh prices are a bit steep.

Mods take a long time to get sometimes with items that only have a couple or just a couple left.  You can learn the flamer mod, I have it on the two characters I still fiddle around with chainsaws on now, but it took over 90 scrap attempts on my first character to get all three mods.
---
are u ps4? my alt is level 25..ive played and traded with a bunch of redditors on here
---
Ok so makeshift warrior will make it last longer then right? 
---
I got killed even though I had passive mode on! Haxxors!!1!
---
I should have scrolled to see if there were any other 40k comments. I'll repeat myself though, Black Rider has a very Chaplain feel to it. 
---
What you're saying doesn't make anything sense though. Why would I want to go through the effort of tracking every single time an item is picked up and put down, then increment it.  That's a huge waste of computing power.  It's much simpler to just look at on-hand inventories.  In fact, if you wanted to be clever about it, and do it with minimal checking, you would take two snapshots.
---
One at day one.  Then another at day 30. If people have "acquired" ridiculous amounts of an item in between those 30 days, it's easy to track, with only having to look at two data points.  
---
Don't you see how that makes sense, and is far, far less complicated than this convoluted "pick up/put down" nonsense that this guy is trying to sell the world on?  
---
&gt;BSG is able to see what items you've picked up, what they are unable to see is if the item is unique, where you picked the item up from and if the item is or isn't duped(this is all info directly from bethesda themselves).
---
Incorrect. They can see what you have in inventory. They have no way of actually telling if it's duped or not, but they can make reasonable guesses as to what a duped inventory would look like. By their standards, based on what they see across every player's inventory, someone with hundreds of thousands of ultracite ammo is an extremely outlier, most likely caused by exploiting. 
---
Look, this really isn't that hard to grasp.
---
Metal or stone?
---
Stone steps trap mobs like no ones business.
---
I actually don't PVP. But I'm not a crying cunt about it either. 
---
If nobody plays the content, then there's nobody to play through the "very hard challenges that require actual teamwork". So you're defeating your own argument here.   
---
Bethesda will suspend your account temporarily if your account has a ridiculous amount of ammo , say 100,000 ultracite ammo.
---
This is because having this much ammo even with perks is almost impossible to acquire without some level of exploiting, in this case in the video Idk what ammo or how much the person had , however Bethesda don‚Äôt manually go through inventories therefore this person must‚Äôve set off a red flag within the Anticheat.
---
&gt;there‚Äôs always more to a story.
---
I wouldn't doubt that is also the case.  I really enjoy this game, but I've reached a point where I don't have much to do.  I log on once a day to just wander around for a bit.
---
...Okay, for help? HOW! LITERALLY! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE! THAT IS 9.7 HOURS PER DAY!
---
I think they should be allowed to enter, but i think the creatures that spawn with the sbq agro them instead of the one participating in the sbq event. Also if theyre under level 50 they should buff the sbq resistances. 
---
Or lower level characters are not allowed to join the event and get the rewards and show up as hostile lmao. 
---
THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT.theres literally ZERO point in me playing this shy until they get thier shit together.one step forward 5 steps back.i mean my whole fuckin build is dependent on adrenal reaction working.i can‚Äôt do shit for damage right now and I‚Äôm about to throw the fucking game out the window

No its uaully mutants or bloodied or zealots
---
According to Wikipedia:  
---
 "the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are respectively; the Conqueror on a white horse, War on a red horse, Famine on a black horse, and Death on a pale horse."  
---
Two tips:
---
  Melee trumps all, I killed level 50's in my 20's without much trouble.  Also, enforcer plus any shotgun is a game changer.
---
  If your drastically under level, swap servers.   Cells tend to spawn at level of who entered them first.  I explored the east side in the 20's with no issue doing this.  
---
  For meeting folks just keep a mic around.  If the seem OK folks plug in and give them a shout.  It's not very uncommon for ps4 folks to go on mic for meaningful conversation and comments.
---
Or could also help cut down on the other type of incorrect bug list.
---
I can't stand the threads people create that say my list of bugs are:
---
Not enough stash space.
---
Fast travel costs to much.
---
Ya just want to yell "Things you want added or feel missing are NOT bugs damnit"
---
From the calculations I read it did add up.  The guy was on medical leave from work, in bed.  All he did was play FO76 Vs a company that has messed up over and over again in their "fixes".  It seems likely that this is another mistake on their end.  I don't know how many posts I have read that people still don't understand the count for ammo they gave was total that passed through him.  Not how much he had on him at one time.  I think just the thought of cheating makes you guys illogical.
---
Yeah, we know you‚Äôre not kidding. He even posted it here. Screw your clickbaity crap.
---
I'm on PS4. I hit exactly the same snag at 26. My friends were running me through places, I was useless, xp was slow. It was boring. Every enemy was a bullet sponge.. 
---
..UNTIL..
---
I switched to melee! Mainly two-handed perk setup (super sledge/all rise) but one-handed (blade of bastet) as backup.
---
Got the excavator armour and BOOM!
---
By level 30 I was one-shotting everything! (And having far more fun) as I started raking in lots of XP, loot and flying through quests.
---
Todd Howard himself banned you for surpassing his ammo count.
---
I dont wish death on them but i appreciate your attempt at hunor. Kinda missed the mark tho with the death thing included imo
---
co\_mod\_50CalMachineGun\_Receiver \[COBJ:003F348A\] - Looks like they added a normal receiver for the 50 cal so you can finally get rid of the prime one if you added it!  
---
"Savvy"? What are you, Jack fucking Sparrow?
---
I agree with ya. Too many people hoppin aboard outrage journalism for views. I used to like YouTube, but now it's just a circle jerk for any opportunist with a mic
---
If you really could make that much ammo without duping it, I'd ask why? Why? Because ultracite ammo is only good for one thing, killing scorched creatures. Plus the 900hr guy said he has almost never shot rounds out of a minigun, so the idea he has thousands of rounds of ammo of a type he doesn't use sounds a lot like he duped or found a duper who dropped it on the floor. Now maybe, just maybe you and the 900 guy are telling the truth. Now I'm sure you both play a lot because in my career of the game I can only achieve 300-400 steel a day picking everything up. It's also hard to believe your argument when you need to farm stuff for a whole day. What's a day? 12 hours? 24 hours? 5 hours? of steel farming alone. it makes no sense. Even if the non-average hardcore Joe could indeed get 140,000+ ammo in 30 days it makes others like myself who play a little over average amount of times haven't heard of the ammo crafting meta. What is so amazing about ultracite ammo that you need over 100,000 of it? But what do I know? I'm just a man looking at numbers.
---
I definitely will thanks! 
---
&gt; EDIT: a couple comments have come up to the effect of "do we KNOW he had  that much ammo on him? or only that much ammo passed through is  account..." I think the answer is most likely yes. It is yes, because  Bethesda told everybody the de-dupe effort was based on finding  abnormally large stacks of things and deleting them. Of course Bethesda  could see a large stack of ammo in his inventory.... Practically  speaking, this is way easier to do than tracking the amount of ammo that  cycled through his account. I find the latter more difficult than the  former. There was a point in time his character was looked at, and at  that point in time he had an ammo count of X." I am not saying that is  the cold hard facts, but I am saying that is your Occam's razor answer. 
---
This is the part that's the most mindboggling here. The simple answer is Bethesda checked his inventory (as they said they did when they eliminated duped items).  They saw impossibly high numbers of ammo, marked it as an extreme outlier, and banned the guy.  Now we have people making up new ways of fake math showing as a way to show the word "acquired" really means that they were tracking every single item picked up and put down between every single character in the entire game over the last 30 days.  It's ridiculous the lengths people will go to bash on Bethesda...
---
Occam's Razor indeed.  The simple answer is people are so desperate to spit in Bethesda's face that they'll latch onto any thing they can, no matter how convoluted or ridiculous the claim.
---
Why a cover? 
---
One of two things. It's either super backlogged (may have got escalated to a different team and that team may be super backlogged also) or it's lost in the void (sometimes tickets get assigned incorrectly or doesn't get marked with a correct tag).
---
I would create an entirely new ticket just in case.
---
WOAH BOY 15 WHOLE HP GUYS I CAN FINALLY WIN THE GAME
---
The EULA for online services like FO76 typically state something to the effect of: "This is just a licence, access to the licence has no monetary value, we can ban you for any or no reason at any time, we can shut down the service for any or no reason at any time"
---
If you *really* want to talk about what Bethesda is allowed to do in the ToS, they could ban everyone or shut down the whole thing right now.
---
With EULAs that broad the discussion shouldn't be whether the ban was allowed per the ToS, because according to the EULA the answer is always 100% yes. The discussion should be whether the ban was deserved/reasonable.
---
Ok so let me start by saying I have a mid-range understand of the game, check out some of my previous posts, I'm one of the insane bug post/report guys.  
---
Not claiming I know everything, just understand how easy some of the fixes are.  
---
-The Miscmods should not scrap for anything to begin with, the simplest fix would have been spending about 5 hours removing the scrap components from the entire miscmod list, or at the very least doing it to the high tier items.  
---
-Miscmods now use a different keyword 
---
-There are several flags and keywords they could have used, similar to what's used for quest items, to lock the miscmods from being scrap able in the first place.  
---
-The only change to the Bulks is the removal of one keyword.  
---
-Adding back the "NoAutoScrapJunk" keyword   Won't effect the MiscMods scrapping, because they are not using the "NoAutoScrapJunk" keyword.  
---
They use the "ObjectTypeLooseMod" keyword.
---
Since they are no longer autoscrapping it means they must have changed how the engine handles "Miscmods" via that keyword.
---
-If they accidentally changed how the engine handles both the "NoAutoScrapJunk" keyword along with "ObjectTypeLooseMod" then they just need to remove the "NoAutoscrap" portion of the change and recompile 
---
Warframe devs have they don't plan to sell the game until it's up to their standards.
---
Loved warframe for the time that I played it, which says a lot for a free game. Spent $15 guilt free on in game currency because I wanted to support the devs.
---
Probably why Warframe has a permenant home on my desktop while 76 has been uninstalled for a lil bit.
---
Hopeful that Beth Austin gets it together... I did the same thing with NMS.
---
I wonder....would you still be banned prior to the announcement that Bethesda were going to be banning people who accessed the Dev Room?
---
I have calibrated shocks on everything including the Excavator.  (except X-01 because I can't find them).
---
So I'm still +100 lbs on the Excavator and I can't de-clutter enough to make wearing other PA feasible. 
---
Combined with Marsupial?  Yes if they are using "Strange in Numbers" and are on a team with other mutated players.  You know Charleston train station?  There is a rock cliff just up the tracks by the bridge.  I hopped up that in about 4 jumps. 
---
Heck, without Strange in Numbers, you can hop up onto the roof of the train station from the tracks while in a crouched position.  With Strange in Numbers, you can leap all the way over the building.
---
Being a shared world means that it's finer fo   OP to build turrets outside the club at white springs.  
---
I just hop out of the water for a second and continue in the water.
---
As someone who has never played F76 before and just came to this subreddit because of this story, your reply (and its upvotes) are mind-blowing to me.
---
Bethesda has provided evidence that there was an exploit in their game. The burden shifts to the now banned account to prove their innocence? You're saying "if you didn't stream your gameplay, stay banned." There is no other way to prove you didn't use any exploit. The step you're skipping is where Bethesda provides evidence (or even says) he used any exploit.
---
Glad to see another join our ranks. Ad victorium
---
Can ypu link the thread?
---
So basically you got banned because BETHESDA can't even believe anyone would play this game that much...
---
I joined a trader group
---
Lvl 46 btw 
---
The clickbaity graphics that youtubers so painstakingly craft annoy the shit out of me
---
I replied below to the person who feels Bethesda did this properly, I strongly agree that this ban was done wrong and ammo should not have been considered in the same numbers as fusion cores or nuka colas.
---
Bethesda also should have not created a monitoring system that bans people who may have accidentally picked up a stack of items from a bag then promptly dropped those items when they realized what they picked up.  Bethesda screwed this up and very likely based on the multitude of evidence has banned at least some people unjustly. 
---
I have not seen any evidence of that occurring and to be fair, I have not been looking. Unfortunately, without evidence I cannot agree OR disagree with what you are saying. My opinion can only be hypothetical. 
---
&lt;i&gt;IF&lt;/i&gt; there exists a group of accounts who have been banned after reporting bugs &lt;i&gt;which they did not exploit before reporting&lt;/i&gt; (ie: reporting exploits only after the BethSoft/ZeniMax announcement) and those affected provide evidence of such incidents &lt;i&gt;THEN&lt;/i&gt; I would be inclined to agree with you. 
---
All that being said; the quote I posted is only a very small fraction of the full Terms of Service. I encourage anyone who has an interest to take a look at the full document (which you have legally already agreed to if you have a Bethesda.net account) 
---
All those words you typed falsely assumed Bethesda was looking at incremental inventory changes, and not the total inventory, which is completely absurd.  Bethesda said they were looking at inventories for unusually high amounts of hard to obtain items, north of 100,000...which is the exact bullseye they hit with this guy.  There's no evidence beyond a flimsy theory this cheater put out that lends any credence to the "acquired incrementally" hypothesis.

/…ôÀàkwƒ´(…ô)r/*verb*past tense: **acquired**; past participle: **acquired**
---
1. 1. buy or obtain (an asset or object) for oneself.
---
Haha.  Sounds like you are a bit salty.  Did you get banned for duping?  My son did not dupe and was banned for having too many colas pass tgrough his account.
---
Right it isn't that hard to grasp, and NOWHERE in the email does it say he currently has that much ammo. That is the point, Bethesda themselves have confirmed it is what you acquired over a 30 day span, not what you currently have on you, which is why they are able to ban people who duped months ago but then got rid of the items, because they keep a tally of what you picked up.
---
I mean dupers that were banned in this wave have already confirmed this, that they had characters banned that had nothing on them because they at one time had over 100k of an item go through their inventory.
---
I am not sure why that is so hard for you to understand and I wish I could explain it to you in a way you could understand, but it seems I can't or you are just choosing to ignore what I am saying because you already have your mind made up no matter what the evidence actually says.
---
&gt;Don't you see how that makes sense, and is far, far less complicated than this convoluted "pick up/put down" nonsense that this guy is trying to sell the world on? 
---
It isn't the guy who is "trying to sell the world" it is coming from modders who know the back end of this game and the game engine probably as well as BSG does. They are the ones that are pointing out that the way the inventory works in this game is abysmal. If you want proof of how bad it is just go take any lengdary item you have and put it in your stash and close the stash then reopen the stash and pull the legendary back out into your inventory, you'll get the pop up like it was a brand new find, THAT is how bad the inventory system is in this game.
---
It's still broken after Patch 6. It looks fine on other people's screens but twisted on your own screen, in third person. Quite broken.

Someone sound butt-hurt.

More then likely but just with how this place is lol

You guys dont want a test client. Then you wouldn't be able to bitch about something Bethesda did followed by thanking them for fixing what they fucked up. Followed by another bug. Which you all complain about some more. But then they fix those bugs with the next patch. And then more "Yay Good Job Bethesda!" Until you realize there are more bugs, some bugs from previous patches! So you complain. But only until Bethesda releases another patch. And then more "Hurray Bethesda!" Followed by.........

You get the picture.

&gt;Let's get this straight. It has no been confirmed he   
---
&gt;has  
---
&gt; that much ammo in his account, only that that amount has passed his inventory over 30 days.
---
But it has been confirmed. The email posted by Bethesda said he had acquired 260k units of ultracite ammo. No where in that email did it say that they tracked 600k worth of ammo "passing back and forth" in his inventory over the past 30 days.  
---
The definition of the word "acquired" is to "buy or obtain (an asset or object) for oneself."

Wow almost didn't catch the "lies" written in the back. Soooo creative /s

I get your reasoning though, especially given how weird the foundations and terrain interact. Even moving a camp a half inch in any direction can render half of it "item needs support" or " interacts with another object" etc. Worst part is, even if you put it EXACTLY in the same place, it STILL wont work. 
---
But yeah, I get it. Tbh, im about to move my camp and rebuild elsewhere anyway. As you figured it out, you'd know that spot is out of the main actions zones. Paying caps to travel is get expensive lol
---
Is there an update on this after the patch from a month ago?
---
Bloody mess affects it
---
If his that big of a celebrity get him to go buy a account and go back playing / duping again 
---
Hey, can you take this post down now? It's been proven that TS counts as a single hit while ADS by you and others, as I originally told you.
---
What math are you doing that shows TS being inferior?
---
Someone else recommended this. But I‚Äôve taken to throwing useful stuff in the ice chest to the left of the front door at the golf club in whitesprings. Seems like players just run away.

You are my favorite tech support person. My calls usually go "I can't access domain names, I can access things by IP address and changing DNS servers fixes it, please escalate this ticket because your DNS is bonked." Nothing infuriates more than when they then start reading from a script.

** Loads tape **

*A High pitched adolescent voice begins speaking*
---
"Hello, if you've found this holo tape, I need to to bring TSE weapons to ... "
---
*A muffled adult voice in the background can be heard, but its exact words are garbled*
---
"Mom, stop bugging me, I'm making my holo tape!  I'll walk the dog later, I'm trying to play!  God!  Anyway, for 250 caps and 1,000 XP per TSE, you can ... "
---
*The adult voice is heard again.  The speaker appears to rip off their headphones and walk away to address the speaker.  You cannot hear the exact words that are being used, but you guess that many of them are 4 letters long.  The exchange between the two heats up as you hear the younger voice start to cry and move out of earshot from the microphone.  You hear footsteps, then the sound of a console being turned off.  Then, silence.*

The dude admits to swapping lots of ammo to and from a mule account and the suspensions are reportedly given when the total amount of rare items accumulated in 30 days exceeds 100k (over 300k of ultracite ammo in this case between the two accounts).
---
Silly maybe, but still an exploit.
---
Hey thats pretty cool. Is that the astroturf from the atomic shop that you have as the flooring? 
---
With some rough / quick and dirty calculations, assuming  WhiteSprings runs were included, and the Legendaries obtained were sold for either caps later turned into raw materials, or traded straight for raw materials, 300,000 Ultracite bullets would take about a weeks worth of work.  
---
Spread that week over 3+ months, and it becomes **Trivial**.  
---
For example every few days I burn off extra Lead/Acid/Cloth/GunPowder and craft 5mm and .556 ammo, often producing around 10,000 rounds from casual collection (not farming for gun powder or lead).  
---
I usually find someone I randomly group with and hand over the ammo or just drop it off at the WhiteSprings station.  
---
Due to the "Black Tuesday" weight Nerf, much of this is going to be curtailed, as today I was forced to loose 20,000 pounds of bulked Junk, and I can no longer Slow walk with 10,000 pounds of junk from a few days farming..  But I'm sure I'll still make ammo to donate from time to time.
---
Because that‚Äôs not sharing man, it only benefits one person to have those turrets up so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best way to share the world. But even then they weren‚Äôt saying that we should ban certain lvls from certain areas just because like you were. That was my biggest qualm with you is trying to tell me where I can or can‚Äôt go, now if you have a problem with me 1shotting every creature before you can get a hit in then I would understand that, and that‚Äôs why people are mad at the turret bases because they can‚Äôt get any hits in and don‚Äôt get loot. 
---
I think the way you worded your original argument left it open to critique imo and I tried to do nicely. Now if you would‚Äôve said I hate when higher lvls come in and one shot everything I‚Äôd get that but you called for a ban from those areas so that‚Äôs where my argument was.
---
it has 6Gb

if @1080p just put it at ultra I guess, should work fine
---
if you want to improve visuals, get rid of anti-aliasing, depth of field, motion blur, and bloom... though afaik no one has been able to disable bloom
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
Is just another thing to add to the unfinished list - along with the Enclave weapons and armour just to mention some.
---
To be fair to release it in such a sorry state - it can only be lvl20, cannot be legendary, cannot be crafted and lacks all the keywords that would make it viable - may as well release it as a static object instead that you can at least use as decoration in your CAMP.
---
I like having the option of moving a S.P.E.C.I.A.L point around, but I would much prefer a paid-for total re-spec.  I would pay as much as 1000 caps to do it, maybe more.  I would be fine if it was a one time thing once you hit level 50 or if they limited it to once a week or even once a month.  
---
It sucks that I have to go up 10 levels to respec the way I want, instead of leveling perk cards, because I had no idea what I was doing or how I was going to build my character in the beginning. I have played FO3, FO NV, &amp; FO4, but the builds on 76 are definitely different than the previous games.  A little latitude for the learning curve would be much appreciated. I can't imagine what it was like for people who had never played a FO game before now.    
---
I‚Äôve seen many 900 hour guy memes tbh , very underrated 
---
Adrenaline dose too ? Nerf rage ? 
---
Where are you seeing that they'll have this in March?  Just wondering, haven't seen anything other than speculation and a late-summer, early-fall timeline.
---
Yes. Rather than doing double damage power, it now does 2.8x damage power.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, they said what?
---
I read all of their updates, but must have missed what they‚Äôve said about not being able to bring your character ‚Äúback‚Äù. 
---
Can you link to a source please?
---
My understanding was that they were encouraging, but not forcing, you to start a new character for ‚ÄòSurvival Mode‚Äô.
---
I also thought you could jump between the modes as often as you like with your character, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anything to the contrary.
---
Silly me! I‚Äôll look into it, bloom is annoying :‚Äô( thank you!!
---
I commented above a little while ago with a breakdown of the difficulty, examples of what I have, and a link to the thread.
---
sorry, ran out of fucks to give.  
---
It does?
---
Fixed bad internet connection 
---
It has been proven that no matter what mods are applied, it will do full 125% if both hit.
---
I‚Äôve also heard if you repair the chainsaw to 200% it‚Äôs damage raises significanrly
---
Too complicated. Who can follow all that!?!
---
I don't think the idea is that it is impossible, just  unlikely.
---
They can see everything you are doing, and I'm sure that if you gave them a good excuse why you were dropping and picking up ammo a huge sum of ammo 50 times they would unban your account.
---
Nothing is perfect and any number they chose would either ban some legit players or leave dupers in the game.
---
I'd much rather they walked the other end of the line and banned a very small number of legit players that could then get their accounts unlocked.
---
That's just my opinion though.
---
You can but that's irrelevant.   The other 300k ammo you can simply pick up off of mobs.
---
Also it doesn't say he has that much ammo only that that much ammo has been acquired, that may or may not include any of that ammo he set down and picked back up or moved to his alts.
---
By his own admission he doesnt have more then 32k of any ammo and would like Bethesda to look at his inventory and show him where he has that amount of ammo.  Based on Bethesdas horrible implementation of everything they have done so far in this game, I'm more inclined to believe the guy with the ammo until Bethesda can show a photo of his current inventory.
---
So......Activision......EA............rockstar....................................... And what is the purpose of this post? You know F76 is a Bethesda game right?
---
Fashion is the true end game
---
I'd really like a sorry or oops emote. There have been quite a few times where I'm doing events or scavenging in hostile areas that are really dark and bump into another player that I accidentally melee or gun bash on reflex.  I back away slowly and use the scared emote but it isnt right.
---
Yeah, pretty sure it applies the same durability damage *per shot (in this case, per bullet)* to all weapons. Or rather, it could be different for each weapon, but for the rapid-fire ones, it's still applying per-bullet and isn't adjusted to a value that makes sense for that.
---
Thats an emote, if you payed 20$ for that dumbass christmas emote bundle 
---
You can also farm toxic Larry's for acid from snallygasters, relog and repeat.
---
I highly recommend Warframe if you've got that kind of time - really fun game.
---
That assumes for those 900 hours all he was doing was acquiring flux, which he wasn't. First, getting to level 450 would require a lot of fighting, and second, in his "What I did for 900 hours", he talks extensively about all the areas where he farmed for experience, items, and junk...there wasn't any mention about grinding flux like a madman.  Not to mention:
---
&gt; My loadout is 3 different explosive shotguns and a vampires combat rifle 
---
In the email from Bethesda, no where is mentioned shotgun ammo. You would've thought that if he was acquiring legits amount of ammo, tons of shotgun ammo would've been on the list. It wasn't. 
---
Second
---
&gt; I spend all my time farming. I have 3 alts with full stashes of junk.  The only things I loot anymore are caps, ammo, legendaries and specific  junk 
---
He mentions looting ammo. No mention of crafting ammo or farming flux.
---
Not a single mention of best places to farm flux, or any of the other materials needed to craft thousands of units of ultracite armor.

Well, "Plague Rider" kind throws that version out the window, no?
---
Strange... It appears we have stumbled upon a murder mystery quest here. The vault dweller named DigBick69 has been MIA since this odd recording was made. We must search out this person. It seems the TSE we had for him is too late.
---
I'd be down with that idea. 
---
Yes to all of this! I like this idea.
---
Gunpowder is a misc item and can't be scrapped...
---
Need something similar for us pleebs. Just change the color and reissue it.
---
I am glad that you are enjoying it. To an extent I do too, although is mostly OCD now.
---
Said that considering this game anything other than feeble and poorly executed attempt to jump in the 'Games as a Service' bandwagon before the cash cow dries up and the shareholders at Zenimax do not get a slice of the pie Ubisoft, Activision nee Blizzard and EA are chomping at would be disingenuous.
---
Fun is subjective and is to be found in a miriad of activities, including but not only kicking a rock down a steep hill - bonus points for ruining the neighbour's roof in the process - but from a technical standpoint this game is a trainwreck and as far as design goes an unmitigated disaster.
---
Or maybe just maybe they counted ammo that was dropped and picked up or was passed to your alts and back to your main.
---
Maybe just maybe Bethesda screwed up like they have done so so many times already with this game.  I can list plenty of examples if you dont actually know them, theres tons.
---
I only repaired my chainsaw twice... the original repair, and then 2 months later.  For some reason "tool" weapons have exceptionally long lasting durability.  My chainsaw was my go to weapon when with others as I'd one shot just about everything with gun or axe...  So I used this to tag enemies.  At 190% durability which lasted me weeks though, it was still capable of dropping a super mutant in a couple of seconds.  
---
In short, it doesn't need durability perks.
---
There is no dammed  way somebody legitimately got 18,000 nuke cherry's or 50,000 rounds of 308
---
they got banned for cheating  straight and simple 
---
If the weapon is unmodded yes.

I would use that every day!

Oh, btw there is a couple places for the Ultracite scrap, and I've collected as much as 60 in 10 minutes using 3 accounts.

Confirmed superior? Thats not what the thread says lol, at the top, it still says the original title of this thread is still true
---
Take screenshots of your charisma and send it to players before talking to them. Don't forget there are wedding rings in game
---
I dunno, the same amount as now? These questions don't make any sense. lol
---
Activision and ea was to show how it isnt just limited to one game. R\* was to show how the p2w hate train is ignored when they like the game.
---
The internet is determined to hate FO76 and is not happy with it unless they can complain about something.
---
Zenimax is not Bethesda
---
You don't know the middle bits of the story because you just casually stroll by the sub while lapping up the shit thrown down by YongYea and company. Bethesda can view the inventory of every person and has provided the list of suspicious items obtained in the last 30 days. u/Glorf12 has 100k+ of *Ultracite Ammo*: the rarest ammo in the game that can only be crafted by the rarest components obtained from Nuke zones. 900 hours or not, it is nearly impossible that a person has gathered that much of UA by legitimate means within 30 days. Hence, this guy needs to prove that he *did* craft that much ammo in 30 days. Apart from ultracite, he also had 100k+ of nuka cola and other stuff: stuff that he has either created himself or obtained from some other duper. Either way, it's ban-worthy.
---
A 100 damage weapon, with 25 from a mod, is only doing 25 on the second bullet, for a total of 150.
---
Woah, getting a strong Warhammer 40K vibe.  That black armor almost looks pulled off the cover of one of the books.  Way better then just the pallet swaps.  
---
But the "canvas" bags (that I didn't order) and the shitty plastic rum bottle holder (that mom wouldn't order for me)..... Checkmate you silly Bethesda apologist!!!!!
---
(tongue planted FIRMLY in cheek and a very big /s)
---
All I know is that I'm having fun playing it and that's all that matters to me. 
---
Got griefed, did ya?
---
You‚Äôre right, I just read through the update again. My mistake on that part. 
---
But there was quite a bit of community backlash stating that they should force everyone to reroll on new toons. But I don‚Äôt have the time (at work) to go back and find those threads. 
---
I said this at that start. What if you craft 50k ammo. Drop it and pick it back up. Does the game register that as you accumulating 100k ammo? What if it was dropped and picked up or transferred between accounts a few times? Do you really trust some heuristic ban script not to fuck up spectacularly like they usually do in banwaves? 
---
Counting that 3 black kids were killed for one of them supposedly rapeing a white girl or something along those lines and had a cross burned out infront of one of their houses.... it's a different world.
---
Also the government is almost completely corrupt along with the cops and its not if your guilty or not its who you know or how much money you have. All of the states supreme cort judges were accused and some even arrested for embezzlement ect just a year or so agao. 
---
I now live out of state and the places I've been to do not compare to what I thought of as normal living in wv.
---
I‚Äôm just curious as to the extent.  Respect all special stats? Reset all cards, or reset all card picks or all the above?   I just wonder at what level people would be happy.   Would a price of say a new serum cost be ok, or just way to much?   I‚Äôm not saying turn it into a recraftable serum just if that 19-21k a pop is too much.  
---
Thanks. 
---
Okay, did a big update of the OP with the results of my tests melded with talking to you and a few other folks and their tests. Hopefully this improves the presentation! My goal is for this to be as universally correct a statement as possible. If TS ended up universally superior I would've struck out the entire OP because I don't want to spread misinformation. That said, it's not the case.
---
Some important takeaways from testing:
---
* **Two Shot adds 25% of the _unmodified_ damage of the gun to the paper doll damage.**
---
For guns like the Lever Action and Handmade, this brings Two Shot's damage bonus to ~19%. This is going to be true for any weapon that gains a decent amount of damage from its receiver, including the Gauss Rifle and things like it. **In these cases, AA is superior by a few percent in damage.**
---
* **Two Shot is better than or equal to AA if you never mod your gun.**
---
This is what the math in your thread shows, and I've verified it in-game and it's correct. Great job on that!
---
* **Two Shot has a bunch of weird behaviors that aren't documented in-game that folks should consider when deciding to use it.**
---
This list includes +100% recoil, +150% spread when not aiming, and heightened durability reduction per shot. If you use VATS or hip-fire your gun, Two Shot feels terrible.
---
* **There are some cases where I do think Two Shot may be mathematically superior, but I'd need data from other folks to know.**
---
Basically this _might_ be the case for rifles or weapon types that have automatic receivers where the gained effective damage from Two Shot is potentially higher than 25%. I would need to see a Two Shot Automatic Combat Rifle against a regular identically-modded Combat Rifle (or something similar) on the paper doll to know for sure.
---
Either way, thanks a lot for contributing to the discussion. My goal is for the OP to be as accurate a final representation of this discussion as possible.
---
So, um... I know people are all "these are 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse themed", but all I'm seeing is Nurgle, Khorne, Slaanesh, and Tzeentch.
---
I understand the argument perfectly. It's how the cheaters want people to think it works, but not how it actually works. They can tell when things are duped due to them having the same ref id. They can't tell which item is the dupe and which is the original at this point, but they can tell it was duped. That's why they took everyone's duped items down to one in the first wave. What we're seeing now is a ban wave of people who were egregious dupers. It's why you'll see posts from people admitting they duped but crowing about how they weren't banned, they didn't dupe enough to get picked up.
---
What is save my stuff? I don‚Äôt see a description 
---
Whether this ban was a false positive or not, I think it was a good thing. If he was a duper, then great, we have one less guy bogging down servers and fucking with the in game economy. If he wasn't a duper and did spend 12 hours a day, every day, for an entire month doing nothing but grinding, then I'd say bethesda has done this man a favor. He clearly had a gaming addiction and was wasting his life gathering high end ammo for an endgame that doesn't exist. I mean honestly, what could he possibly be saving that ammo for when my mate with vanilla 50 cal can take down the hardest enemy in the game with less than 2k rounds?
---
I drop thousands of rounds all the time,  these rounds arent even crafted they are found on mobs often ghouls at white springs.  In 3 hours I can get 10k rounds from ghouls at whitesprings.
---
how you have that many objects placed without hitting the limit
---
Huh?
---
Yeah, I'll bet. 
---
Holy shit, now this is something I'd  spend money for.
---
I only have one turrett!
---
TS ADS, with the exception of certain guns like shotguns, is counted as a single 125% projectile.
---
Journalism in general these days is mostly a joke. I took journalism in high school and wrote on both my college and high school newspaper - even entertained going into it in college, but ultimately decided to go with the "safer" route of IT. The first thing that was drilled into our heads was to always be objective. Fair and objective reporting. Don't insert your personal feelings into it. Don't try to be sensational. Report the facts as you have them. Show every conceivable side of the story. Give everyone involved an opportunity to voice their side.   
---
Today, we have journalists that just take information from a Reddit post and claim it's a news article. Same thing happens on YouTube, and I say this as a gaming YouTuber with 15K subs, so I'm literally talking about some of my peers. I will say that some of the channels I follow are doing a better job than they used to at getting all the facts and being more objective in their reporting, but many do not. Instead, they paint the picture that the internet wants to see. Instead of objective reporting, we get 1,000 word / 10 minute circle jerks that serve as little more than group therapy for people that need to have their opinions validated. It's mental masturbation. Even OPINION pieces (you know, editorials?) have their basis in facts and try to show both sides of the story. 
---
Think about it for a minute, would Bethesda intentionally get rid of a paying customer?  Maybe it would be better to word it as forcefully rather than intentionally :P
---
Except for the fact dupers that got hit confirmed they had characters banned that had nothing on them. So they were not looking for totals currently on the characters, but amounts of things that went through the account over a 30 day period.
---
He was supposedly the one who warned everybody of the bridge collapse or something like that
---
Right, which is why my idea would probably have to be an entirely separated game mode, or perhaps like I said they might do this for the PvP servers coming up next month, who knows.
---
Selling your scrap is actually worth a lot of caps. I always feel better emptying my stash and getting caps. It's like converting rather than just trashing it. 
---
I just gave away like 40lb of plans to new players. It adds up quick.
---
Can you show me what numbers you used in the equations for each?
---
I just want split servers already.  Pvp and pve. I don't want to fight other players.  I have no interest in that.  If I want to play against other people I'll go back to Battlefield.
---
I just want to roam the wasteland with my homies fighting deathclaws and shit. Being part of a group doing missions is awesome! 
---
I do understand that some people like pvp, it's just not my cup of tea. 
---
Most of the common misconceptions could be easily avoided if Bethesda provided any sort of FRIGGIN STARTUP GUIDE, TUTORIAL, FAQ, OR WIKI to provide any information for game and player interaction mechanics.
---
Or, do what they do, and leave most players in the f'ing dark without even a modicum of support.
---
It‚Äôs just handy fuel right? Been awhile. 
---
Thats subjective. For raw damage, TS is objectively better.
---
PvP was created on the *on and off* switch foundation. I understanf the approach they were trying to take here. By adding *slap damage* they were able to rule out the old school way of opening a player tab or profile menu to send a duel request that may or may not be answered, accepted or refused. Their innovative thinking brought a new concept to pvp initiation but in the long run it wasn't fully thought out. 
---
My opinion is you shouldn't be able to damage players period if they are in pacifist mode. And under the same rule you should not be able to damage players using slap damage. When they attack you both parties should receive 0 damage until both sides have attacked 1 time. As it stands right now the person who is being attacked has the advantage because they know before their opponent does when and where they will shoot. But eh. I am sure they will keep tinkering with the game making it better making it worse. I know they won't release modders on it like they did in F04 because that isn't cost effective, profitable or logical from a business stand point.
---
Not everyone agrees with you and I. It got downvoted lolz
---
I get 1k steel in an hour by collecting and scrapping weapons from harpers ferry super mutants.  10 steel on average per weapon x easy 30 weapons per run through town.  That's 300 steel in minutes.  It's hard to believe because you dont know how to do it,  that doesnt make it hard to believe it makes it hard to understand for a casual gamer who doesnt min max
---
Jim Sterling just did a video about it. It seemed he'd cherry picked the info he liked and ignored the discussion around duping items.
---
Used to be a big fan of his. Now, it's easy to predict what he will say. 
---
Thank you.
---
&gt;Not fun at parties.
---
You don't fucking say.
---
Use T-60 for your legs, that's all I'm saying. Costs like 1 aluminum to repair. No springs required.
---
Seriously,  not enough context to assist with what may have happened to you.
---
From my experience with posts like these, there is a game mechanic you're either unaware of or just ignored.
---
The multiplier is *not* a consistent +28%.  Damage modifier from resistance is capped at .99 meaning as soon as the damage to resistance ratio is above `(.99*(1/.5))^(1/.366) = ~6.46` any additional penetration is useless.
---
....aaaaaand your point is? Lmao I know not everyone agrees with me, I don't give a fuck. Weird that you do, though
---
True, the government here is corrupt and terrible. I hate the things they decide to vote on and I feel like I live in an oligarchy rather than a democracy
---
Indeed. In my experience, by just visiting the nearby fissure sites after a SBQ nuke, between the SBs that spawn and the Ultracite Ore you pickup around them there's usually enough Ultracite coming in to maintain very aggressive Ultracite ammo production.
---
I remember months ago my post would get downvoted into oblivion for simply stating the fact RDR Online didn't have pay to win. I played it. There was no pay to win element. Guns were bought with dollars that you acquire in game as the currency for selling stuff you hunt and fish and gather or from missions. Gold the premium currency that is also awarded by in game missions was spent on stuff like clothes and horses. But yeah GTA Online was totally pay to win. I never bought one shark card for that game though. I just did mission grinding and got stuff I wanted in time. I played RDR Online for a little while but found its online to be pretty boring grind for money, same as GTA Online, except GTA Online had a lot more stuff to do. So yeah there were people who knew nothing about RDR Online doing the same thing here calling it pay to win, when it wasn't.
---
Regarding the 900 hour guy, He says he didnt dupe any items and never has.  I have also never duplicated crap, I'm not banned but am still defending those who may have been wrongfully.
---
I see ninjas, bottom feeders for events that loot corpses and are there for the XPS.
---
Won‚Äôt fight, just lurk.
---
"Did you own a workshop? 
---
.... yeah
---
"....."
---
Yes I am talking PVP because it is a part of the game even if people want to stick their heads in the ground and try to ignore it.
---
I do not use sentinel. One character has most assassin's stuff while the other has all weightless. There is nothing wrong with sentinels because it can be beaten. You just adapt and compensate if you run into those players. You don't demand nerds because you don't understand how to deal with it.
---
For the no power armor specific perks, you have misunderstood me. I meant exactly as you explained it. They turn off in power armor. I would not want to use power armor if I use perks that require me to be in normal armor.
---
Power armor being loud is important for PVP. If I am taking a workshop and have no clue where the owner will spawn in at and suddenly I hear stomping from one direction, I now have the advantage. I feel if you must be one of those pve only people. If you embraced PVP as being a part of the game, you would have a better understanding of how certain things are the way they are and why you should not be able to wear legendary armor underneath a hazmat suit.
---
The last couple levels of under armor along with high end PA mods need flux.  Basically critters drop several nuke zone mats (that dont expire) that are combined with plants (which expire quick).  The raw flux (plants) also sell for 11ish caps each so it's quick money as well.
---
I'd rather it be 100%, but maybe it's quest related, and each role out it grows 10%.

Investigate WHAT? You have ONE fucking player that loves your abortion of a game and you BANNEd him. Case closed, investigate what???

Also hilarious how this was fucking FINAL until you got negative attention. We all know you will lift the ban, that's all and you will fucking never make up for it and admit to how SHIT you are.
---
Fucking idiots!

Full trapper with lead mod and rad resist perk. Also tried max rank of ghoulish.... So pretty annoyed. Cant go in a radzone without a hazmat or a PA.
---
There's no "test" to be done, besides verification that TS ADS is considered a single projectile, which you verified.
---
Can you please show me the math where an AA version of an identical weapon does more damage against the same enemy?
---
Slap damage is capped at 5HP and is unaffected by Bobbleheads etc.
---
these are the skins I've been saving my atoms for since release. The meshes and textures have been in the game files since beta.
---
What is your username? On PS4?
---
Ok well I‚Äôll try it then. I don‚Äôt need to constantly grab at strings trying to change your mind, that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôm thinking, also what is the true point of making ultra cite ammo? I‚Äôm sorry but even I a person who doesn‚Äôt play as intense as you doesn‚Äôt need ultracite ammo to kill the queen. And making it just to make it seems foolish to do and a waste of farming potential. 
---
You can say the ban was worthy but you cannot say he needs to prove anything, as that is impossible for him to do. That is the part that makes me wonder if this is fanboy shit. You must understand that only a streamer has the luxury of having proof they didn't hack or use any exploits as you not only cannot prove a negative, you don't have access to the account.
---
Nah it goes against my build of always having max health, so bloodied is pretty much worthless to be
---
&gt;No one is running a modless gun against the SBQ, they're running with at least a Hardened or Prime receivers or something similar, both of which make the Two Shot damage gain closer to 19%. 
---
It would be disingenuous to rule out whether the weapon is modded or not and whether someone even has the mods unlocked yet. I only picked the SBQ as an arbitrary damage target. My gatling gun presently doesn't have any damage boosting receiver but it is my go-to gun for the SBQ.  
---
These calculations also don't include some other important factors, such as perk damage (which does affect two shot). A rate of fire receiver for instance could end up being better for a two shot than a damage mod.
---
Ah ill look for it when i get off work, thanks bud

Bethesda has stated in their emails that the suspensions are due to the player acquiring over 100,000 of one, or more, rare in game items within 30 days of game play. Based on that, a player could theoretically drop, and then pick up a rare tse shotgun 100,000 times, as long as they had initially acquired the shotgun 31 days of game play ago, and they did not acquire any other "rare" items during that 30 days. But, it they dropped it and picked it up one more time, they would trigger Bethesda's algorithm, and get a (suspension). Also, based on Bethesda's statement, a player could craft 50,000 pieces of ultracite ammo, drop it, then pick it back up, and they would not trigger Bethesda's algorithm, as long as they did not acquire any other rare items during that 30 days of game play. But, if that player crafted, dropped, then picked up 50,000 pieces of ultracite ammo, and then got a rare tse shotgun as a drop from a legendary mob, that should theoretically trigger Bethesda's algorithm, and they would get smacked with the ban hammer. The scenerios I described are based on Bethesda's use of the word "acquire" in their email, and their description of "over one hundred thousand of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of game play. I am taking "acquire" to imply crafted, bought, looted, or picked up from a bag or container. I am also making an assumption based on my understanding of their game engine, along with statements they have made regarding lost inventory items, that they cannot uniquely track each rare items on an individual basis, which makes me assume their algorithm is only capturing how many times any "rare" item enters a players inventory. One of the biggest problems in understanding if you are at risk for a ban, stems from the fact that I have no idea what they consider a "rare" item. But, it would appear that ultracite ammo and fluxes are considered rare items. It is also possible that fluxes and orbital strike beacons are both considered rare, and that the algorithm is counting both the rare materials used to craft a rare item, as well as the rare item itself. I've only seen one example of a letter from Bethesda, stating to a player, what items served as a trigger for a suspension, and since there is no way to know what items were actually in the player's account, their is no way to work backwards and determine how Bethesda's algorithm actually works. Additionally, the letter that I saw gave me the impression that certain types of ammo were the trigger, however, it seemed very odd that someone who was dupping massive amounts of rare ammo didn't seem to have any other rare items in their inventory. Without knowing what all you have done in the past thirty days, it's impossible to know if you are at risk or not, but you are probably safe. Based on how well things have been going with all of Bethesda's patches and "hot fixes", I am sure their algorithm works correctly, and accounts different legimate play styles. You'll be fine.
---
What did I miss, who's the Nuka cola shit head?
---
It's already ingame.  We call it crouching.
---
Can't be seen on the map while crouching unless you're flagged for a bounty.
---
I did. I'm the OP of the post his referring to. Check my post.
---
Again you still don‚Äôt take into account trading and the community as a whole. You want to act like he had to farm all those mats himself but he didn‚Äôt he could easily trade a god roll item for 50k plus of any kind of ammo. And farming flux with a group that doesn‚Äôt need specific types and gives them to you is very common ime. That‚Äôs my biggest qualm with your argument tbh you don‚Äôt seem to want to include trading and clans in your responses but hey I appreciate the time it took you to craft that response and hopefully Bethesda can clear up the concerns, they probably won‚Äôt do to privacy concerns even tho OP said he doesn‚Äôt care. 
---
I'm using i9 9900k, 1080ti and still lag as fuck.
---
And you you really expect people who were legitimately suspended/banned not to say they are innocent?
---
They only thing we can do is push for actual information and a time frame for those suspended. We do not know how the algorithm works nor how they are actually handling those accounts that were flagged and suspended. though since some have gotten a permaban follow up, I would not be surprised if they have actual humans working through the list of suspended accounts. but that is just my speculation.
---
I'll update my OP but basically it makes it so if you favorite a item, you can't drop it or sell it until you unfavorite it. Very simple. Very important.
---
My argument, if you read my post, is that the Bethesda system is incorrect. I may have picked up 600+ ammo, but it was all the same ammo being repeatedly dropped and picked up moving it between accounts. 
---
They've yet to show more than just a totals tally. I've heard nothing back from them in over a day.
---
Please don‚Äôt. I have no interest in people raging about untrue rumours.
---
I only replied to your post because it sounded like you had official info that I had missed, so it‚Äôs all good! üëçüèº
---
Its pay to play and honestly it's gotten somewhat better recently but it's still worse than most of this country.

What other serums do you have?  I would buy marsupial and several others if they are available.  I could pay in caps or in combo of caps and steel.

To be honest it's a shame. I'd love to use that jacket with other under armors.

I‚Äôm in the same boat. Just brushed off F04 myself. If the updates don‚Äôt start to go in a more attractive direction, I‚Äôm probably going to have a bunch of space suddenly open up on my hard drive.

Exactly.

I mentioned waiting until a shareholder meeting before and got told quite clearly that zenimax is not a publicly traded company.
---
"Allow for one or two stray shots at a passive player, but limit the amount of slap damage that is done, regardless of how many perks and bobbleheads the griefer has enabled."
---
How about capping the amount of slap damage that is done?  Obviously Bethesda didn't expect people to be able to deal 3000 damage with one hit and the percentage of slap damage is significant.
---
If you really want to talk about what Bethesda is allowed to do in the ToS, they could ban everyone or shut down the whole thing right now.
---
Killed one last night. Doesnt drop much good. Mothman Wing pretty useless.
---
No, when a TS is ADS, it's counted as a single 125% projectile.
---
When hipfired, it's counted as two 62.5% projectiles.
---
Is the antler hat in second picture an Atom shop item or craft-able?
---
Occam's razor: Simplest explanation is the correct answer.
---
In this case, people are saying this guy played 10+ hours a day with the sole purpose of crafting ammo. Like insane amounts of work would go into crafting that much ammo. You can find some walls of text laying out the method.
---
Or he duped it.
---
Occam's razor says he duped it.
---
Without sounding rude, what's the charm in the cap ?
---
Nice one OP, well written. Also camps cannot be damaged by a player
---
Well he didn't warn the 40 or so people who died in that bridge (the Silver Bridge) collapse

I‚Äôd like to craft the barn quilts we see around. We could pick the colours. I want the doilies too, but that‚Äôs just cause I tat in real life.

Yes, comrade tell the dirty pig dogs that their propaganda isn't working and ours is. 
---
Lolz, no. I Didn‚Äôt get banned. I‚Äôm Still playing actually.
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of duping, and folks involved, the supply chain and the demand that created it. 
---
I will admit though I can see the appeal.
---
I burn through 5.56 and .45 ammo easily and if I was easily coerced I consider it.
---
Good luck.
---
He deleted his topic but was telling everyone to join his lawsuit because bethesda banned him for no reason. Look through his post history and it months of him selling thousands and thousands of nuka colas to people.

I love it.

But explain why it‚Äôs called that

People, even half a city away can trigger it!

Watago is one of the best locations to see it in action, if person A is at the train Station, Person B is heading to the SuperDuper Mart and Person C is shopping with Vendor Phoenix Person A will often get the targetting effect, it seems to bounce off both players and NPC's.  
---
I can't effectively test the total radius inside FO76, besides antidotally trying to test the boundaries using 2 accounts, but due to the number of crashes I was getting I gave up.  
---
It's worth noting that if your grouped with someone with a Targetting HUD  there is NO range limit, one person can be doing "One Violent Night" and gain the HUD effect from his teammate in Watago
---
Good Lord. I might just buy them!

Oh wow, like a lock setting. Great mod!

I think of it as rare custom Raider skins developed by the factions using the still-somewhat functional pre-war tech to customize their boss-gear and left behind as they died off.

That said I'm getting some serious 40K Chaos Marine vibes from these and I'm totally fine with that. 
---
Almost all tick melee damage weapons do!
---
No... This is not true at all. I did all my testing with Hardened Receivers. Where's your source?
---
Need Ark survival mind wipe lol
---
Of course he doesn't *have* to prove anything. So he should quietly wait out the review process like everyone else who are "innocent", instead of trying to gain sympathy points from everyone in the sub. There is also something called circumstantial evidence: dude has 300k+ ultracite ammo and you want me to believe it was legit just because he says so? If you suddenly had 100 billion dollars in your account tomorrow and the IRS froze your assets,would your word of mouth be enough to convince them?
---
Affects all of your family.
---
Bump.
---
I suggest that guy check his router or firewall, or if he paid his bill. Lolz
---
&gt;I understand the argument perfectly. It's how the cheaters want people to think it works, but not how it actually works. 
---
No, it is literally from Inside the vault post from a few months back. When they talked about the duped items. It is the same reason why if you have a legendary item and put it in your stash and close the stash and then take the item back out of the stash you will get the pop up again like it is a brand new item, because BSG can't tell if an item you pick up is one you already had at one point or not. Just like how they can't tell if the ammo you moved to an alt and then back is the same ammo, thus it counts multiple times toward the 100k cap.
---
I do apologise, I often use 'shareholder' as a placeholder of sorts for any person or entity that puts x amount into something expecting exponential returns may it be achievable or not by any means necessary.
---
Which is false. I asked him to provide the math to prove it, and he won't. The math in his OP has already been proven wrong by multiple people.
---
Circle jerk much? 
---
From what I have heard the only real change they made to the p2w side of RDR2 was you cannot bypass the lvl cap for guns.
---
You can still buy everything with gold, gold is still a chore to get if you dont pay, you can still by pass the lvl caps for outfits and such with gold, but not bypass lvl cap for guns.
---
You can get tesla off robobrains and at random from some level 3 safes, if you want the plan for free.
---
NP, if your using app just sort by comment, I was one of the newer ones.
---
Have you ever had your antivirus tell you that something is malicious when it really isn't? Or to your knowledge really shouldn't be. There are websites filled with lists of certain antivirus false positives. Sure some people will lie, but I don't believe for 1 second that everyone banned did something wrong.
---
Correct, having a bounty prevents you from losing more caps than you would without a bounty.
---
Pvp an die without bounty will cost you the equivalent caps to your level.

A level 45 50 cal machine gun has a base damage of 36 (source: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/50_cal_machine_gun)
---
Suppose the player shoots the scorchbeast queen (300 ballistic damage resistance) once. How much damage does this gun do?
---
With no modifiers at all it is (36/300)^0.366*0.5*36 = 8.28.
---
With stablizer level 3, granting 45% armor penetration (36/(300*(1-0.45)))^0.366*0.5*36 = 10.31:
---
With stabilizer level 3 and two shot: ((36*1.25)/(300*(1-0.45)))^0.366*0.5*(36*1.25) = 13.98
---
With stabilizer level 3 and armor penetrating: (36/(300*(1-0.45-0.5)))^0.366*0.5*36 = 24.799
---
Now, I'm not 100% sure in these calculations, because I'm not sure if two shot does indeed give a flat +25% to damage, not am I confident that armor penetration stacks additively. For instance, if it stacks multiplicatively it becomes:
---
With stabilizer level 3 and armor penetrating: (36/(300*(1-0.45)(1-0.5)))^0.366*0.5*36 = 13.29
---
which is not as good as two shot (assuming two shot is basically just a flat +25% damage boost).
---
I'd love that. And once they introduced player shops it'd really help with the decor. Even if I just wanna display a whole bunch of toilet paper I have so it looks like I'm selling it.
---
A display case/shelf where you can display anything. Guns, junk, ammo, bears, bobbleheads.
---
I'll make sure to tell everyone on the server to crouch 24/7 next time I play, then.

Check your carry weight. Check your weapons and ammo, and see if a whatever associated perk card got

Occam was some philosopher and he would shave away assumptions (with a figurative razor) until he had the simplest answer.
---
I know that feel.
---
They already said people can port over existing characters, so not likely. 
---
And the best gun for pvp in the game was a Varmint Rifle which cost very little and was available pretty much right off the bat. I don't know if they have changed stuff, nerfed it or what, but that was the fact when I played it.
---
Yeah, the acid isn't the hard part, well none of it's actually hard really. Is that why I'm getting down voted? Because ammo is much easier to craft than these people think, hence why they think some dude must have duped it?
---
Probably, I've heard of Agile (I know what it is), but I'm not in any IT relate field.  But I've worked with enough of them to know how they operate, in a general sense, and I've been involved in more than a few projects where I worked with those people closely.
---
Not a lot of people understand how that all works, it's a ton more complicated than anyone really understands (even me).
---
I don't know, but people who think were not legitimately suspended have taken it - albeit with a clear sense of foreboding - with the only people that can do something about it if they feel like it maybe: Bethesda themselves.
---
Is a long shot but is the only shot available.
---
You do realize this is because roughly half of their player base is suspended. Right? The server is dealing with an astoundingly less amount of people. 
---
Not really. Increased stash again and just more bugs than the dirt in a cemetery.
---
&gt; I may have picked up 600+ ammo, but it was all the same ammo being repeatedly dropped and picked up moving it between accounts.
---
And I have to believe this utter nonsense of a sentence?
---
If I had coins I‚Äôd give you silver, thanks mate!

Damn I wish I was that lucky. Grats 
---
I only spoke with 1 publisher and it was Eurogamer. 
---
My argument now and forever will be that I have never had those amounts of ammo in totals. I listed in extreme detail my process for shifting items and what I think has occurred. 
---
At this point I honestly don't care what happens, I just want to play fallout 76. My life is fucking shit right now and this game for whatever reason clicked really well with me.
---
I enjoy the terminal and holotapes of the quests. Finding the hidden connections between a holotape and terminal entry and something that I noticed in the world. The story isn't completely linear, and you'll spot hidden easter eggs that you didn't notice the first time around. Spoilers: I'm looking forward to seeing what happened to the spoiled brat Freddie who went to the vaults when they open and what happened to the Overseer. I enjoyed the voicework of the Freestates questline, and learning about Modus. Bottom line, if you enjoy discovering a story on your own and piecing it together I think you'll like it, if you enjoy interacting with NPCs, who you can respond in several different ways with, you won't enjoy the quests. 
---
I'm almost 200 hours so I play somewhat sparely compared to before. I'll usually do a vendor run and the daily challenges for atoms(15mins). If someone launched a nuke at the scorch queen I'll do that. If the ingame friends I've made are on I'll play with them. If not, I'll log off. I'm excited for new content in March.

But it's so much better than a ripper =[ when double replaired it eats stuff fast. Rippers double repaired are meh. Then need to make it craftable and maybe add to the legendary tables.

&gt; Because that‚Äôs not sharing man, it only benefits one person to have those turrets up so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best way to share the world.

And one shot killing everything before anyone else can tag it  at Uranium fever is? 
---
The internet is determined to hate on everything these days, or so it may seem. 
---
Not sure about that. Out of 4 discord groups I‚Äôm part of I have not heard of anyone that has been suspended.
---
That‚Äôs over 400 players. So not sure how prevalent this suspension is. 
---
Yeah, pretty much this. I ran my X01 armour for over a month straight, I maybe *maybe* repaired each part once.
---
I haven't even repaired my T51 beyond my initial repairs from pulling it off whatever frame I found it.
---
Neither do I but unlike the files on my computer I cannot get all the information regarding the bans. And without that information you really are not in a position to judge if a file should be let through.
---
Sorta like how people were talking about a new "bug" that the patch brought in when it turns out 3rd part mods were the problem. They were defaulting to blaming bethesda when it was not their doing.
---
I tried nuking for pvp on my first nuke and never did it again. What a waste for everyone involved. 
---
Was the guy who killed you named "tehsandman"?
---
I'm on Xbox. Kami Seb.

Jesus Christ, the level of stupidity some people have are insane. I wonder if he was on Xbox, they could sue him from breaking terms of service.
---
One of the main issues is that your Workshop doesn't defend itself against players...  Well, at least not when they are claiming your Workshop.
---
I, as a test, claimed a Workshop.  I setup defenses for the Resource Extractors and some Overwatch Missile Turrets.  I then had a friend who wasn't teamed Claim the Workshop.  My turrets ignored him.  Then, when the claim is done, the Turrets turn on me and kill me.  We repeat this 3 more times to see if it is consistent, it is.
---
This is why I Hate this change...   Unless you can cause the other player to enter PVP with you, though Bounty, they claim the Workshop without worry of being attacked, while the old owner now has to fight their own defenses to even get near...
---
Yeah i keep on sun kissed so i dont have radiation damage and regenerating armour so my health is always maxxed
---
Upvoting because I‚Äôd never seen that before
---
That should prove my point.  I say that the multiplier is the same for a single 125% projectile as it is for the two 62.5% projectiles and you say it is not.  Test it.
---
125\*(((125/300).366).5)    (156%)
---
 vs
---
2 \* 62.5\*(((62.5/300).366).5). (2\*50% = 100%)
---
You should see an enormous difference, vs what I'm saying which is:
---
125\*(((100/300).366).5)    (125%)
---
2 \* 62.5\*(((100/300).366).5). (2\*62.50% = 125%)
---
I would just like to be able to disable trading in general.  Twice now this week, a random has invited me to trade.  Twice now, I declined the request.  Twice after, said randoms tried to kill me (they failed).
---
Which is exactly what I didn't want. I just want to play 76. This shit got far too much attention.
---
Nice work i found a tse combat shotgun with 50 DMG resist when aiming from watoga station for 480 caps.
---
Just gotta be right place right time good luck with it lever action I've had one for a while is my Goto weapon
---
I tested with *pure* Hardened Receivers on TS and regular Handmade, Combat, and Lever. They all did 125%, while TS ADS of the the damage while regular ADS.
---
It *does not* do unmodded damage. If that were then case, then TS pre-nerf wouldn't have done straight double damage with improved receivers, which they did.
---
Correct. It was exposed by Washington Post. 
---
Apparently they name drop the reporter on tours in the bunker and he‚Äôs not portrayed in the best light.

And they literally didn‚Äôt test it

Isn't it ironic that Bethesda is now banning the only people who genuinely enjoyed and care about this dumpster fire of a game?
---
Decorating packs like pans for stoves, plates and cutlery for tables, books and clutter for shelves, faction flags, curtains on curtain poles, water features with fountains and koi fish swimming around in there, clean bath, toilet and showers with flush on toilet, running water in shower, greenhouses for crops, and most of all TV‚Äôs that play the vault Tec videos called ‚Äúyou will emerge‚Äù from before launch or at the very least the colour ‚Äúplease stand by‚Äù image maybe

I see what you mean but what is the level requirement to join the enclave and be able to launch nukes? I didnt think there was one so if a low level can launch the nuke they should be able to join

How weird. I've logged off and on, turned my device off, the lot, and every time I log back on, no matter how many hops, they are never there. It always takes days for the chainsaws to repopulate for me.

Obviously not that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do it but thats more on toxic players than higher lvls in general. I‚Äôve been at UF with 3 lvl 130+ people who I didn‚Äôt know and we somehow all shared the kill. It‚Äôs not hard to just tag the supervisors but some toxic people choose to 1 shot them(btw I could 1 shot them by lvl 40 so the higher lvl argument is mute imo)
---
It wouldn't hurt them, might actually prevent an unwanted pvp encounter, or encourage one depending on what side of the fence you land.

Aren't those based on the 4 horsemen as well though?

IT's this month's "Rad Worms" Feature-Not-A-Bug incident! :D

Now you literally see the little icon everywhere the player is involved

Look up the formula. It says that you plug in the damage that the weapon does in that fraction. You also use that same number in the end for the multiplier.

He was not duping.  He bought colas with in game currency.

No, something strange. I think it was sin or something spelled out with symbols. I'm on Xbox so clearly PS had a fun night too. 
---
I mean did you read my original post? It goes into extreme detail the exact way I think their system is broken. 
---
This shit is news worthy, because they ARE banning legitimate players. Why the fuck is everyone suddenly on Bethesda's side? Because my post got traction?
---
I wish the raider had some unique...qualities.  
---
I'm a PA Completionist, I want a full suit of each type, each one I have a "plan" for.

T51 is my generic combat armour, my X01 has jet backs, so it's just for getting to strange places. The only thing I have planned for my Raider suit is to give it rusty knuckles.  It should get an innate bonus to melee.

It really seems like there are two groups of players. One groups main appeal to the game is leveling up, getting powerful, and doing endgame. Like other mmo style games. That is fine, and a lot of people are going to be attracted to that. Like you. But I think the problem is that a lot of the game is meant for the other group. The group of players that likes to explore slowly and take in the lore and the world. The endgame is not the destination. The journey is. The game tried to do both and is failing. 
---
As someone who can't have large amounts of sugar, if the bombs fell, I would want an ice cold fountain Coke, or a nice southern style sweet iced tea. Then I'd just sip it as the blast wave took me away. There are worse ways to go.
---
Only I used the XP glitch on 1 character and I stopped using it once it hit level 50. The rest were grinded to their various levels through monster mash. W/e drops I got from it were discarded and not kept on any of my characters.
---
I could see them bring Blackbird paint before they release these to try and deplete peoples "Free" Atoms so they have to shell out real money for these. The butthurt on here and other sections of reddit would be crazy if they did do that though.
---
how though. READ THE POST I MADE.
---
I feel like this is all im commenting today. I literally went into extreme detail explaining everything I did step by step.
---
We don't have all the information yet because Bethesda isn't giving it out.
---
We messaged last night. Still have my mutation, so gonna try it out tonight! Cheers!
---
&gt; The definition of the word "acquired" is to "buy or obtain (an asset or object) for oneself."
---
Yes, as in it's not the same as "currently holding". You just proved the point you're trying to argue against.
---
Intelligent.
---
Rule of thumb: throw away things you are not using, no matter how rare you think they are.
---
I could see them being applicable to all the usual sets. Plus, you can bet your ass I won't get any of them if they arent. I want that pale rider paint for my T-60

TSE?
---
I forgot i was on the Fallout 76 Reddit and Beteshda could literally sell you a beating and you will say you love it.
---
Please drive to BGS and explain this to them. You have cut to the chase of the problem with 76.
---
Second group, checking in
---
Does that formula specifically say that it is calculated that way for the 2 shot?  Of course not.  Test it.  Seriously.  It should be easy to tell the difference between a single shot weapon and a 2 shot that's hip-fired.  Because you're saying the damage goes DOWN if you're using VATS and you know that is not true.
---
You're going to have to link that, because it's counter to everything I know and have heard about ref ids.
---
Was gonna say.. had a guy who I saw absolutely destroy the SBQ shooting me and was doing like zero damage... I think it's already in place. Seriously if it's that bad just go to a new server.
---
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. NO. What the FUCK?   
---
HOW would these exist? HOW would these have been produced, even pre-war? 
---
Not sure what platform you're on, but roughly of servers down 30% of players I heard. Ps4 and xbox, down a little more than 50. Ps4 severs reportedly only have like 4 people in them at best now. Can't speak for xbox.
---
But let's be fair about this. We can't really say the servers are doing great until all the suspended players are back, when the numbers are at their highest is when we should judge the performance and sustainability
---
I posted all of mine... you are claiming the second shot in two shot is getting 25% of the base weapon damage+weapon mod damage?
---
Gonna let you in on something... Wanted or unwanted pvp encounters do not equate to griefing.  
---
It's just perspective an opinion. Thank you for sharing yours, and with that I don't agree with any of what you posted.
---
Safe travels in the Wasteland!
---
&gt; You have banned the only legitimate player base left playing your game. 
---
That is,indeed,true.
---
You're mistaking the word concept with implementation.  
---
The idea of being able to drop a nuke and make that area a raid area (like the OP posted) is a good idea.
---
I don‚Äôt see how you couldn‚Äôt get that much ammo with 900 fucking hours. Do you know how long 900 hours is? I‚Äôve spent that time on Gmod over the past year. 
---
Lets imagine that this guy was actually just really enjoying the game a lot and found a lot of ammo. If that is the case then well. You guys and Bethesda are all assholes. Doesn‚Äôt get much easier to explain then that.
---
sorry people are having fun with a game, it must be so difficult for you
---
Correct and where in that definition does it state "currently has". If they were going after people with that much CURRENTLY on the characters they would word it like this "Character was banned for being in possession of over 100k of such and such". Not "character acquired over 100k of such and such over a 30 day period. Not even stating "the last 30 days" which would also be stated if they were talking about currently having that amount of items.
---
I reapplied mine and it definitely worked. Shows up properly in the effects tab, and I can also watch my damage numbers decrease in real time when I use a stimpack. 
---
yea it doesnt trigger walking in there anymore it's random like the other events now
---
I literally just tested it and my Hardened AA Lever Action does 93 while my Hardened TS Lever Action does 111 with no perks. I don't know what to tell you, it was definitely not up to 25%.
---
Do you know that you can play a game for 900 hours over the course of more than 30 days?
---
Fo76 friends and I jumped on The Forest. It's a $20 game. It was refreshing to have a game that free roamed and didnt push you in a certain direction but did have an end game once you decided to pursue it. 
---
True you didn‚Äôt use the word ban so I apologize for putting words in your mouth, however the implication was that you think it‚Äôs ridiculous for it to happen and would prefer higher lvls not to be there so call it what you will.
---
This is VERY helpful!! I will let my team know so we can prepare. We play on PC but I appreciate the offer! 
---
A lot of people get confused when they buy timed items and they stay in the selection menu even after it expires. Seen it over and over again here on reddit
---
My friend apparently got a sex change during load screens. She loaded in with a mans head and woman's body.
---
That really suck but thanks!
---
Dont events randomly trigger once someone walks nearby tho 
---
i was same with ffxi (played it for 12 years, had same idea as you did with wow).  
---
i played diablo 2 for 8 years, when diablo 3 was coming out i got really excited about it.. when it released i was on a lay off from work. i played that from the time i woke up until the time i passed out at the controls. i would go lay down or wife would wake me up to go lay down. i would hit the bed sleep an hourish and something would wake me up saying i neeeeeeeed to go do or try this.. then back at it..   
---
was like that the first 2 weeks of diablo 3, roughly 20 hours sleep in 2 weeks, unknowingly at the time i ended up losing feeling in both pinkys due to evidently carpal tunnel kicking in from playing.. unhealthy? oh yeah.. dangerous? obviously.. signs of addiction? yeah definately.. but i was having a blast. i was making the most out of the real money in game auction house and broke 1000$ selling stuff i was finding (remember i was on a lay off, soo making money playing).  
---
fo76.. i goto work, get home eat dinner jump on game play til 3am, go to bed, up at 9pm and off to work, wife knows im addicted to games but would rather have me home instead of in a bar or casino (course she also knows if she were to walk in eyesight naked. game would get paused for awhile) and if needed will go do things she wants to do.
---
tl/dr: its easy to get sucked into games for some of us.  
---
That's not common or inexpensive gear either. It's why I posted tbh :/
---
Mister PvP is leading the downvotes, though, so I expect this thread to go nowhere (read up).
---
I killed 4 scorchbeasts the queen a deathclaw, a mirelurk queen,2 sloths and a hermit crab in the span of 30 minutes. Also nothing. But i did kill a stingwing and got that one! But i think that was a daily.
---
Almost but there for the same reason! Ended up going down the road a little towards the lookout tower, spot with the stone arch
---
I mean I‚Äôve played Gmod for 800 hours but that was over the span of a year.
---
Good point.
---
Agile from what I understand was developed decades ago but tuned and delivered successfully by Toyota. It is widely used in software development houses requiring fast time to market and constant feedback loops to improve product
---
Well i mean, your claims arent entirely perfect either, you said that there is zero spread but from what i have been seeing people say, and from my personal experience, there is some amount of spread between the bullets, ads just reduces the spread, it does not matter if the two shots are being treated into one damage calculation, there is still spread between the bullets, and you have claimed that two shot is better on the basis that it provides higher damage, what about recoil? Doesnt two shot increase recoil? Not sure if i missed it but i did not see you acknowledge recoil in your thread
---
Cant wait to get that Deadric looking  Power Armor
---
not all events some just spawn on the map this used to be one you triggered when you were in the school but they changed that
---
I agree. OP is level 55 and feels done with the game. I am level 67 and I still have about 40% of the map to explore. 
---
Agreed. I wish they would make so it can have lvl 20/30/40/50 variants and the relevant keywords at least.
---
For me it doesn't need to be 'meta', just viable. I have a ton of fun with a quad harpoon with flechettes. Is not optimal, is not op, but man is it fun.
---
 I live in the Mire. There water everywhere and knee deep is not at all unusual.  Its like you did not even read what I said.
---
No but apparently you have already all judged those banned as guilty and liars because the "computer" says so. Do you think innocent people dying as collateral damage from military actions is acceptable? Do you think a justice system can be called a justice system if one innocent person is behind bars?

---
Caveat emptor..let the buyer beware.
---
Who, uh owns the responsibility of doing their research, BEFORE buying anything?
---
Uh. You.
---
Who owns the risk of buyers remorse for an ill advised, purchase?
---
Uh you.
---
Was there an offer of 100% satisfaction guaranteed at the time of purchase?
---
See a pattern forming? 
---
If $80 was of significant amount for you to invest in a game, 
---
Maybe you should‚Äôve spent more time researching,  before buying the game.
---
You might want to turn off V-Sync and then use limit your framerate (I use NVIDIA Inspector and limit to around 75 I believe). For me, this made aiming much smoother. I had to do the same for Fallout 76.
---
The biggest noticeable difference in fighting in Fallout 76 is the netcode and the fact that you can experience lag. It's not uncommon to attack an enemy, have them die, and then take damage from an attack they did before the server acknowledged they died, or before you received that they attacked you again. Otherwise, it's mostly as smooth as in Fallout 4. 
---
In general, Fallout 76 on all high settings runs at a higher framerate more consistently for me than Fallout 4 does 
---
I've replied to a lot of posts so if you haven't blamed anyone I apologize for that.
---
All I am saying is the criteria they used to ban those accounts was to lose and had a high potential to catch innocent players as well and shouldn't have.
---
Players who accidentally hit collect all on a brown bag to then find out they accidentally collected 100,000 bobbleheads, who then dropped those bobble heads, would be banned for the action.  These individuals would be innocent but caught in the ban net because the ban includes all rare items of a type you collected over 30 days.
---
The problem isnt that everyone proclaiming their innocence was wrongfully accused, its that Bethesda has done the ban horribly.
---
Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but umm... No, you can't play for 900 in the spam of a month... Unless you know how to access 156 additional hours in a month.
---
I think there‚Äôs something wrong, it seems like sometimes the paper bag may not even be showing up in their game right away. I know I don‚Äôt have problems if I‚Äôm teamed up, but there‚Äôs been times where it‚Äôs like they just don‚Äôt see it, full on confused emote going on after I made a big deal over my drop for a couple minutes
---
I got an Instigating one from Wallace. ;)
---
Serves you right for getting to stand there and do nothing and just kill everything
---
I‚Äôm on PC and most servers were close to full yesterday. The one that was almost empty was because we had stayed on it for a number of hours and people had left. Leaving our group on it‚Äôs own. 
---
The discord groups I‚Äôm part of include players from both consoles and PC.
---
This type of report is not being experienced by any of them and we have over 6 main time zones covered between the groups. 
---
Basically the servers are still populated with active players according to what people are experiencing in the discord groups. 
---
I toss all ammo for guns I'm not currently using. I keep about 3 fusion cores on me and 3 or 4 in stash.
---
Junk I bulk everything I possibly can. My camp is fully built how I want it to be so my needs for materials are low. 
---
I dont limit how many bulk lead, steel, acid or adhesive I have as I use those the most. I probably have about 50 bulk lead and steel now. I keep at most 2 of all other types of bulk. I sell off the rest. The items that dont bulk I keep about 25 to 40 of for things like leather, cloth, wood, circuits. Maybe 15 or less for gold and fiberglass and silver. I keep about 50 ballistic fiber since it's hard to get and about 100 screws. 
---
Make note of the items you use most for repairing your guns and armor and discard most of the rest. It's easy to obtain in a day of grinding and you dont need to use stash space for it. 
---
I keep back up stimpacks, radaway, the occasional magazine or  bobblehead stored if I come across ones I may want to use for a SBQ or nuke zone. 
---
I keep a full back up set of armor in my stash, and all my cosmetic outfits. 
---
And I keep about 15 weapons of various kinds if i feel they're something i may want to play around with later but they dont fit my build. 
---
I'm constantly at capacity tho but i also stash all back up chems and bulk to sell easily at vendors with a stash so i dont have to lug them around on my character. 
---
yea good luck finding much in the way of parts plans those pretty much only come from distant thunder and are hard to come by I've done that event like 200 times or more and have like 3 t60 pieces and 2 t51 pieces
---
It was a two day thing. When it first showed up, the game said you had 1 day left until it is removed from the shop, so people assumed they had 24 hours to come up with 1800 atoms and started panicking. Turns out, it was actually 48 hours thing and that's when people noticed anything between 24\~48 hours show up as 1 day left on the atom shop. I personally paid for atoms to get the paint job. So I'm not gonna lie. if it gets re-released, I'd be a bit disappointed.
---
We're all seeing it now. You're hitting the big time! The one time you didn't want to.
---
Submit a bug ticket to Bethesda.

I'm not sure how many silos you have cleared, but it takes me ~10 minutes to clear one, the only ones that took me an hour were the first few when I kept getting lost and didn't know the shortcuts.

&gt;The popular youtube personalities that like to act like they are the end all of knowledge, really don't know as much as they think they do.
---
May I suggest:
---
&gt;\[people\] ... really don't know as much as they think they do.
---
There are a lot of counter arguments to your statements but I'm not sure you are looking for discussion. For the casual player there are so many cap-sinks in the game that it's not an unhealthy economy. 
---
Link which part? Where if you take a legendary out of your inventory and then pick it back up you get the pop up again like it is a new item even if you have had it for months? Or the inside the vault where they talk about how they can't tell if an item is duped or not because they are unable to tell where the item was gotten from?
---
I see what you mean, and despite for the defense I have for this game, I do not think bethesda (or any company) has the customers in mind outside of how much will they pay.
---
That said I would say the PR for the game is a train wreck, but I never got that feel from the game itself. Problems sure, but hardly a train wreck.
---
Hooray! I didn't disconnect!!!
---
So one day the whole sub is screeching about how much they hate the atom store, and the next people are drooling over future content. Interesting
---
I don't know what servers you get on but I have never seen one with less than 15 players in it - on PS4.
---
Where are you pulling these "reportedly" stats from? Who is reporting these stats?
---
I hope we get excavator paint. As much as i love looking like a watogan school bus im ready to not be yellow. Off topic what was the item plan that got removed?

I‚Äôm level 76. I know the only region that I‚Äôve discovered all the locations in is the forest. I‚Äôve only launched one nuke, and it was at 74. Strangely enough, somebody else launched their own nuke at the queen within a second of mine. So I got to watch two bombs fall. 
---
He's running a plague walker build
---
They keep saying they're listening, taking in feedback, and keep nerfing stuff no one asked for.
---
Well, I can't really argue against it, so I guess you can.
---
If by "killed" you mean the largest selling game of the franchise, then okay.
---
[It ought to look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/xZRUq.png) With the pose angles slightly down to better draw attention to the small paper bag holding fifty rockets, a full set of composite armor, three miniguns and some drugs.

 I kind of felt the same after far too much farming on 2 now 50+ chars.
---
 I quit fast traveling. Works great. I walk from my place in the Mire to The Whitespring every day looking for a Jet Pack, then I just wing it and wander, hunt Scorchbeasts and I think I've found all the Fissures. ;)
---
Your commitment to dying on this hill is just bizarre. Why do you care so much, bending over backwards to defend obvious cheaters?
---
You literally make up all these imaginary scenarios to try to defend a guy who just duped, that's it. Why are you doing that?
---
2. So mid-battle I am going to receive messages from someone who wants my items for less? I am suspecting a lot of /r/ChoosingBeggars will be present
---
3. Ok, so would the list of items be universal across all med supplies or unique to whichever I choose? Will I have to travel across the map to try and find what I need? Will med supplies show on the map? 
---
As I said, I think we need to have a way of setting up a shop, whilst I am not against your idea, there is a lot of things which would need to be considered.
---
I'm not sure what the best solution is, but it would be nice if there was something that didn't just allow us to make things available in a box somewhere but allowed us to advertise our shop/items. 
---
I had two guys drop me some gear and it was great. I then disconnected and felt like a total prick. Game just drops me at times and it just so happened it took place as people were giving me stuff. Ffs
---
Can confirm, I am that friend :)
---
I love spreading the mutant love‚ù§
---
Some players deliberately stalk other players and use the following tactic:
---
*"Did you just shoot me? (This is quite douchie, but you got to what you got to do):
---
This is pretty simple, once your target is shooting at something. Jump in the way. Now that they attacked you, the advantage is yours."*
---
Saw the tactic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj79bt/the_raiders_guide_to_the_wasteland/
---
I have studded heavy legs and they have better energy resistance and damage Resistances than my heavy BoS combat legs
---
People on this board seems to have an attitude which is, "This is the post-apocalypse. It's every man for himself/ survival of the fittest." That is, until this mindset becomes a inconvenience to them.  Then suddenly they are all about etiquette, and the 'proper' way to live in a shared world. 
---
And I wasn't judging anyone for ruining the game for low level players. 
---
It's a simple fact that none of my best legendary weapons have come from White Springs or Uranium fever.  If  I sound critical of high level players farming there, the simple reason is because I see no real point. 
---
I've been running into you in the wild a lot lately lol
---
I'm not attacking you I'm attacking your argument. You ignore everything that has happen to massively over simplify all the updates and fixes applied to the game into some item and game tweaks.  All while being so generalized with your statements that you don't say anything.  
---
hey would you mind elaborating just trying to wrap my head around this. Are you saying it was an error while coding it and not a nerf? 
---
You do not have to be publicly traded on an exchange in order to sell shares in your company, have investors, or investor meetings commonly termed as shareholder meetings. Privately traded companies usually have a fewer number of large shareholders that finance the companies growth in return for equity. Often these private investors (Private Equity Partners or Venture Capital Firms) hold board seats and the board meeting replaces the need for a wider shareholders meeting because your few large investors all have at least on representative on the board. A large stake of Zenimax is owned by [Providence Equity Partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_Equity_Partners) as well as stakes owned by other investors. They would be considered shareholders in Zenimax who expect a certain return on their investment and likely influence what projects the company works on. Most of the executives also likely hold shares as this is common practice for VP and C level compensation.
---
So yes Zenimax does have shareholders, who meet, and expect a return on their investment.
---
I agree that dupers actually offset some of the game flaws.  
---
The part where Bethesda says that duped items don't have the same ref id as the source item. Or that they can't track items by ref id.
---
I havent judged them guilty, nor have I found them innocent. I don't have the information, and neither do you.
---
And you are getting a bit hyperbolic by comparing suspensions/bans in a video game to the justice system. (a system that in and of itself is broken depending on who you talk to)
---
Bye Felicia.
---
&gt; I cannot think of any reason to have that much ammo.
---
Just to play a little devil's advocate here, the email only said "Ultracite ammo" rather than a specific type. That sounds like it was 140k combined of all types of Ultracite ammo. For reference, there are 16 types of Ultracite ammunition, and that includes calibers you would stock in bulk like 5mm.
---
However, Mr. 900 Hours himself has claimed that he's never had that much Ultracite ammo at any one time.
---
can I have your stuff?
---
This is crazy. I had an extremely similar camp in the same exact train. Right down to the windmill and water purifiers. I ended up moving to a spot for more water. Great job!
---
I'm level 116 or so and I'm still discovering small spots nd unmarked locations I've never found before.
---
Only thing I havent done is launch my own nuke yet. But I have spens the past couple weeks doing the various challenges and it's been really fun. I sont even care much about atom points but it's fun to go for 100% or as close as you can since some are broken. 
---
any of those ultracite? :P
---
I have a hole setup for sale with mods. 3000K if interested 
---
It hurts everyone, but it hurts ranged more. Ranged basically requires bloodied to stay remotely competitive. I play both, and you can easily get your non legendary melee tool tip damaged above 1k without adrenal. This is a lot less common with ranged weapons, which basically requires to bloodied, Instigating, or furious to keep up with even all rise, a guaranteed quest drop. Add in the fact that melee gets boost from strength and the multiple food buffs that increase melee damage only. 
---
In short, someone on the dev team has a huge boner for melee. 
---
I still hope they take that back. A one way transfer is ok. But if you can go back and forth really easy I think it opens up a lot of opportunity for grief. 
---
Accurate.
---
I would like to hear the counter arguments
---
HaHaHa This made me laugh for real. Thank You. 
---
I keep seeing that TS rifles are terrible for VATS. Never tried one, it's the main thing that keeps me with my furious LE. 
---
Would like to find an AA lever action, but I've never seen one; either in game, mentioned anywhere, or for sale/trade.
---
An AA VATS Lever Action is my instagasm unicorn.
---
I guess I'm in the minority here... the second and third look kind of ridiculous, almost a Skyrim/Fallout crossover.
---
\*Greenbrier
---
As someone from the area (about 5-10 minutes away depending on traffic) I feel I should warn you, people here are ***very*** particular about you pronouncing things right
---
They have never stated they are using some kind of black and white 100k item threshold to blind ban accounts, and have in fact stated that once they found a culprit, they performed a more in depth account probe. 
---
In actuality you have no idea of the technical specifics and due diligence applied to the ban procedures and neither do I. You are presenting your anecdote as fact when it is not.
---
I'd say it resets all of your Special stats so you can change build. Because moving 1 point pre level is really annoying because at high level it takes me forever.... I'm Lv 169 and its so lame wanting to edit my build a wee bit. I have to wait like 6 Levels of moving stuff and that also removes getting cards so if I wanted a new card it'd be like 10+ levels. It's just annoying.
---
So all Special stats and it's be much cheaper and easier to get than a serum because it's not changing how you play, it's just letting you redo your special alicantion. If that makes sense. 
---
Heh, I have a Sheetz within walking distance of my house in Virginia....worth it!
---
I second this!
---
Oh yeah, or they call them QoL issues. I just ignore those people
---
True
---
ok I read it, def looks like it could be but im still slightly skeptical/hopeful. 
---
It's boring and handling the outcome expensive. SBQ is a resource sink for 1 legendary and some plans you already have or don't care about. Whitespings is RadAway sink and not much better than non-nuked legendary-wise. I know more spawn but you have more eager people to one-hit them and not share.
---
I like how you have the costume bit wrong, the 4 from the Atom shop count as cosmetics, so, they get placed OVER your armor whereas the outfit you get for free counts as actual armor. So, 4 out of 5 let you keep your armor and they were the ones you bought...
---
&gt; Yes I am talking PVP because it is a part of the game even if people want to stick their heads in the ground and try to ignore it.
---
Heh, it's not a very GOOD part, though, is it? You seriously think that perks and prefixes should be balanced around the tiny minority who PvP?
---
&gt; I do not use sentinel. One character has most assassin's stuff while the other has all weightless. There is nothing wrong with sentinels because it can be beaten. You just adapt and compensate if you run into those players. You don't demand nerfs because you don't understand how to deal with it.
---
I don't see what nerfs I demanded? I suggested that Sentinel is broken, because it is - it's additive, the only bonus in the game that is. That's just stupid. That was absolutely not the point of my post though, you brought it up.
---
&gt; For the no power armor specific perks, you have misunderstood me. I meant exactly as you explained it. They turn off in power armor. I would not want to use power armor if I use perks that require me to be in normal armor.
---
I did NOT misunderstand you. It is written in the description "no power armor" - they don't "turn off", they're simply not meant for players in power armor. And MY point was that you absolutely don't NEED them in power armor. We're talking very different builds, with appropriate perks, you may be sure I get this JUST FINE.
---
&gt; Power armor being loud is important for PVP. If I am taking a workshop and have no clue where the owner will spawn in at and suddenly I hear stomping from one direction, I now have the advantage. I feel you must be one of those pve only people. If you embraced PVP as being a part of the game, you would have a better understanding of how certain things are the way they are and why you should not be able to wear legendary armor underneath a hazmat suit.
---
You fear correctly.
---
There are two reasons why I don't PvP, and here they are:
---
1 - I like to actually have FUN. Without the griefing pitiful arsehole drama that so-called "PvP" players bring to ANY game. Those players are not in it for the challenge, unless the game is built around it. They're in it for the power trip. This game has broken mechanics which allows for a zero-challenge PvP experience, and if you enjoy that it's fine. Seems a bit lame though.
---
2 - This game is not a PvP game. It was tacked on. And it's not even a well balanced PvE game - the prefixes for armor and weapons are ludicrously unbalanced, with the majority being downright useless. Junkies? Cmon. Do you seriously think that PvP is taking place in this game on some kind of balanced level?
---
Look, I get defending your position, but can we not be childishly naive??
---
Looking into whether or not this was an intended change in the patch. Will update once I have more info.
---
Do you have any BE Gauss
---
I'll pray to the mothman for your future success as thanks
---
You‚Äôre literally banned for using a nonexistent glitch lol
---
See, this is the right mindset for the game imo. If any game is open world like this, it‚Äôs meant for you to take time and explore, not do a speed run. 
---
I think he means that the system Bethesda uses is counting the gross sum. It isn't taking into account when he drops ammo or trades it, instead, it just keeps counting up. I.e. if you dropped 600 ammo and picked it up 5 times it would count 3600 instead of just the initial 600.
---
The people that this hurts most is the new player. Good luck getting any upper tier weapon outside of a drop. 
---
There's also For Honor's Warrior's Den to look at.
---
Well I‚Äôve gotten multiple pieces of assasins sentinel and bloodied explosive weapons there so I guess our experiences are just different which is totally ok.  I just pointed out why someone who‚Äôs a higher lvl would want to farm at these places and it spiraled from there. Sounds like you‚Äôve got good intentions and I hope to run into you sometime at whitesprings or UF or SBQ or wherever else you want to play!
---
I keep all ammo and when I have a surplus, I use/craft a gun to match during visits to the Forest for materials.
---
I'll keep a level laser pistol then use up all of my surplus energy ammo, give my .308 rifle a rest.
---
I'd much rather have the respec thing be far far cheaper and easier to get because I'd want far more casual players or people who just don't play often or trade to get them and those people may not have tons of caps. 
---
Great advice. That was my one sad moment last year when touring the state was to leave my digital camera in the car. It was still well worth it to see the GBO up close, but dang I wanted a picture to show just how dang big it is!
---
We need to be able to trade for Atoms. I've said it before: DE (Warframe) show's how it's done. Why does Bethesda have to reinvent the wheel for everything?
---
I'm with you there. That would make it one of the best cosmetics in the game.
---
Wow, great minds think alike! 
---
You still have disconnecting issues? Hells with your game 
---
Any idea if we can get information from those meetings the same way we get it from publicly traded ones?
---
I would be nice to see what their true take is since that have to tell the truth to investors by law, but to those who buy the product they can lie until they are blue in the face. And I am sure a "live service" would come up in an earnings report (or what ever the private side version is).
---
Sounds good.  I will add you later tonight when I get home from work.  I'm rogueraider72.  What times are you usually on?  
---
That is a fantastic suggestion 
---
there's a moron emote?
---
Yeah, I mean they put a help menu in there with a metric shit ton of information... But what good is that!?!?
---
I‚Äôm always on 
---
Gaming journalism stopped being a credible source years ago, if it ever was one. Most of the people have absolutely no clue what they're talking about, usually have never played the game they report on, and sometimes it's just a flat out copy paste or rephrasing of a reddit post (yes, even more lazy than those youtubers we all love to hate). 
---
What really upsets me the most with this state of affairs is that A) people outside of the gaming community who use them as a news source are hilariously misinformed, and B) the one out of a thousand gaming journalists who are competent and do their job properly are lost under the wave of garbage
---
I remember being in my 20s and finding a Max level TS Pump Action at a vendor.  I didn‚Äôt bother selling anything and bought it right away before I could get a CTD. It felt like forever before I reached level 45. 
---
And your bags highlight for everyone to get!
---
Did you restart your game and check cause mine worked great till I logged off the server
---
There are entire threads dedicated to well documented bugs, glitches and oversights that affect core components of the game. I know from a reliable source that none of this is something that is even in their radar yet because they have bigger fish to fry.
---
If the core mechanics of your game are broken and this is not a priority because you have more pressing matters to attend to then the game is a trainwreck.
---
Not the mention the entire Enclave faction that is unfinished, unpolished and in certain aspects broken.
---
The environment - which is largely a straight port from FO4 with a few changes in the way collisions and textures are handled - is fantastic and some of the detail you find in the world shows that at least one person cared about world building, but the choice of making everything about 'go there, kill a thing, read a note, come back' makes for a bland and unengaging experience.
---
Is sad because I keep finding evidence of people I would love to meet and stories I would be elated to flesh out. Alas everyone is dead so everything falls flat.
---
Your idea of journalistic integrity doesn‚Äôt exist, sadly. It would fall on deaf ears.
---
I still have to plug in my head phones to get any damn sound.... and I'm getting disconnected more frequently. Wow. Just wow
---
The "HANGRY" builds....
---
That would be awesome! I‚Äôm on PS4, you?
---
I had that today. I couldn't figure out where I was getting damage from. My friend turned up and said I was being shot by 2 super mutants and eaten by some rad rats. I couldn't see any of them! Grenade spamming the area she said the Super mutants were in got me 2 kills however. 
---
Sooooo much this. I love making psycho and having to dance around auto-scrapping it sucks. 
---
They‚Äôre fine for vats, but you have to wait for them to stabilize before you take the shot. 
---
Yes!! My PSN is iloverotini
---
93 x 1.25 =/= 111
---
That doesn't make any sense because I've shit my TSE, pulled it at the last moment and watched one round nail my friend and the other kill a ghoul to his right with the second bullet. Are you suggesting it did full damage to both? With both bullets dealing the 125% damage?
---
Oh really? I never bought them, still haven't. Just saw post when the even was going on that only the silver shroud actually worked like an outfit.
---
The only one I have is the mistress of mysteries you get from the questline that does replace armor you are wearing.
---
Think I got the Radium rifle plan in a l3 safe on the roof beside the Harper‚Äôs Ferry bot. 
---
I have one 
---
Never looked at it. Maybe they should put a handy guide or tutorial in game directing us to the help menu.
---
take a break , dont grind till you hate the game .  
---
Separation anxiety. 
---
A lot of the issue is brought on by their game design though. You can‚Äôt play in a squad and slowly explore and enjoy and environment, reading as you go. Your friends are talking and just want to move on and shoot stuff. So if you like to do pvp and play in teams, you are likely going to ignore that side of the content and just get to the endgame. 
---
Who said anything about shilling and that it wasn't? The hell are you talking about?
---
I take that heart as fighting words making fun before finishing. 
---
Thank you for the advice!! Just one question, what are cells? Is that how the game generates enemies?
---
and new characters would mean no old dupes would make it into that world, which would make sense since it's pvp
---
It‚Äôs not imaginary my man I‚Äôve traded well over 500k ammo in my playtime, not in a 30 day period but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not an active trader or poster on this subreddit. I‚Äôm simply pointing out that it‚Äôs incredibly possible to acquire this amount of ammo yet you keep telling me it‚Äôs not, looks like we‚Äôre not getting anywhere but I appreciate the passion you have for this game because I share it and do want duper‚Äôs banned permanently, but also I believe a certain amount of skepticism is healthy and that goes both ways my friend. 
---
Obviously you refuse to refute my ideas about trading and clans and that‚Äôs because you know they‚Äôre correct, anyways hope you have a good day!
---
I am so jealous of you right now.
---
Yeah, I realize that, but 111 is the damage my TS Hardened Lever Action was doing.
---
Totally.   I just remember after the TSE nerf lots of people were asking for resets but never mentioned as to the level.  I think then they wanted everything because there was lots of talk about 9 points of this and 5 points of that.   I wonder if I posed my question as an OP what kind of responses I‚Äôd get.  
---
Good hunting.  
---
Gauss is classified as an energy weapon (I guess do to how it it accelerates the projectile) and a ballistic weapon, the projectile is ballistic and it does ballistic damage. 
---
math is hard- 
---
say 100k ammo is the spark of ban but it does not have to be a cumulative in single obtainment. 
---
100k divided by 2000 = 50 
---
2000 ammo placed and removed from one toon to another and back again 50 times. this can be a different player every time ,buying legitimately. 
---
I'd love to have a robot or NPC to harvest my crops.
---
Why not just equip Pastor Vestments or the Clown outfit?
---
Where is everyone finding these plans, I've only ever got the Confederate Dress and I'm at lvl 89.
---
I know, I'd never think to click a "help" button if I need help with anything. I need an adult to show me how to do it first.
---
It's nice to see actual faces and hear developers talking, rather than the ominous looming prescience in the shadows who comes along every once in a while to nerf stuff.
---
Damage doesn't go down in VATS or hipfire; ADS simply guaranteed that every hit will be a single 125% hit.
---
There are a few ways to interpret it. At it's core it is a philosophical logic principal attributed to William of Ockham that succinctly states one should not make more assumptions than necessary... for, well, anything.  
---
That core principle extends to the analysis of situations with multiple explanations. If we follow the guide of not making more assumptions than necessary, we tend to land on the simplest answer. 
---
Often times Occam's razor is somewhat incorrectly defined as "when multiple theories exist to explain something, the one with the fewest variables is correct" or even simpler "the simplest answer is the right answer"
---
That is not, strictly, the razor, but rather a thought arrived upon by using it. 
---
Hmm.  That isn‚Äôt highly polarizing, I don‚Äôt understand.
---
It's good they're being proactive about the incoming scorched virus

" You can only launch each silo once every 3 hours. So you would have to launch each silo 156 times, plus one silo. To do every silo solo every three hours the fastest you can do it would be 471 hours. "
---
if you have a good group of friends you play with often, fast at running silos, and fast at killing queens, 156 times would not be unbelievable in a few days really..  
---
3 people run a silo, stagger nuke drops to spawn back to back queens.. looking at maybe 60-90 minutes work to hit 3 queens.. jump servers to next set of silos hour or so later 3 more queens, jump servers to next set of silos, rinse repeat.  
---
can easily.. easily get 15 queen runs in 3-4 hours a night.. 150 in 10 day without much work.. sell plans, sell gear.. buy what your missing on a trade group, i know several friends who have no use for flux and give it away, run with a group of 4-8 people that dont need flux and pass it off to you since they know you do, can get massive amounts of flux quickly.  
---
i have witnessed groups like this blow through a server, see a nuke drop.. jump down there, by time i get to queen and get a shot or two off shes dead (they were already waiting) soon as shit hits ground nuke warning launches, shes melted in 2 minutes.. soon as shes dead another nuke warning.. finally when she dies the third time they all disappear off server.. 
---
you have hardcore experienced players functioning in a team, with players that can solo a silo in 15 minutes, each doing a seperate silo, then waiting to stagger their nuke drops, you can easily knock out 3 queens in 30 minutes, jump servers for the next set.  
---
260 = 2x 130
---
1.25 x 130 = 162
---
Two shots were nerfed 
---
I run an explosives build, every type of grenade, fatmen, missile launchers and AGLs, when she's in the sky I'm nuking the hell out of all the mobs to keep the gunners alive but once she's on the ground I hit her with my AA AGL and Fatman. Then back to mob clearing while she's in the sky.
---
Hahaha so now we are going to have dark souls-esque glass cannon builds...red tearstone ring, power within, dragon torso stone. You're running around with a sliver of health, looking like an anorexic reindeer on fire, and one-shotting bosses. I can see a similar thing popping up with emergency protocol power armor builds running nerd rage, bloodied, adrenal reaction, etc
---
Which proves my point. 
---
Stairs that don't has to be in the centre of the floor 
---
Your counter arguments don‚Äôt mean shit. Literally listen to this dude. In my 700 hours I have never gotten a god roll. Like do some research. If you a casual gamer then you really don‚Äôt have a problem cause there isn‚Äôt much to get yourself into that you can‚Äôt handle. Now if your end game and more hardcore, you could still be running around with the same stuff as you were lvl 50? Fuck that. That‚Äôs bullshit. All there stupid algorithms and stupid shit that they included for ‚Äúloot‚Äù like gtfo. Literally no longevity to this game since you can‚Äôt even play the end game, that doesn‚Äôt exist. Should be easy enough. You play long enough you should get a better chance of getting god rolls, not more fucking wooden armor. Duper‚Äôs did suck to a point cause some people will always take it too far, but atleast I was able to get a decent weapon from them. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

Kentucky resident. Went to Pittsburgh after Thanksgiving and went through WV. I absolutely loved it

Fusion Generator that can re-charge cores, even if it takes a "game" day cycle....
---
3,000,000 caps! Goodness gracious!
---
Literally anything to bash "Triple AAAaAaAaAaAAAAAaAAaAaAAAAAAAAaaAAA" companies.
---
&gt;Using Strange in Numbers seems to reverse the damage by more than half.  Without it i do 397 with it I do 500 something.
---
I really am not sure what you are saying here.
---
Don‚Äôt bulk anything but lead or aluminum or they weight more.  Keep around 200 screws springs and gears.  I keep 400 steel and don‚Äôt limit my adhesive.  I also keep my aid items to 65 lbs max.  Don‚Äôt store unnecessary ammo types. 
---
Not just what you and others have pointed about but the inconsistency of his story.  
---
1. He did a guide to what and how he did everything to get all that ammo. The thing is his guide was done before the ban wave and after he got banned and he said as much stating he wrote the guide because he had time after getting banned. 
---
2. In his own guide, he stated he used a macro to harvest flux and stuff because it was a way to glitch the amount you get while harvesting. basically, it's a way to dup while harvesting. 
---
3. his 900 hours is irrelevant because he got banned for having something in just 30 to 31 days not the entire 90 days since the game has been out. I mean simple math shows even if he was up for the entire time all  30 to 31 days it's just 720  hours and if its 31 days 744 hours. There is no possible way for that to happen if we are to go by Bethesda's account that this is for 30 days. 
---
4. He came here claiming he was banned in the ban wave by a mistake yet by his own words when talking about his guide he did he admitted he was banned before the ban wave.  (check point 1.)
---
5. There is just way too many inconsistencies with him and his story. 
---
Make them all into .38 Ultracite rounds ~~and then get banned~~.
---
Some better .38 Auto weapons would be nice though. 
---
I agree, but I don‚Äôt like PVP anyway. Past nuke zone trips have been quite cooperative: I was taught to try and at least get my whacks in and don‚Äôt kill anything until people around you get their whacks in too so we all benefit. However I was in a nuke zone yesterday afternoon trying to collect all of the things you want to collect, and trying to be polite and all but watched lots of people shooting each other. No thanks, I‚Äôm just here for the mass and fluids...
---
That's the primary difference between publicly and privately traded. Publicly traded companies must disclose financial information quarterly within specific rules set by the exchange and the government where the stock is being traded. Privately traded companies only need to disclose to their investors as stipulated in the private contract. This is why we know exactly what Bobby Kotick makes but don't know what  Robert Altman  does.
---
Well, it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt see the gravity of how exactly to run an online game multiplayer service. They need a test server because it‚Äôs all I would play. I would live and breathe feedback and testing and hypothetical setups with access to things I don‚Äôt have in the live game, and spend my live game time differently for relaxation. 
---
I would test or program in this game for free because it‚Äôs awesome. That‚Äôs how I played unreal tournament and quake team fortress. 
---
I don‚Äôt know how we can help them realize what is gonna be needed to get the online multiplayer service element up to what the players deserve. 
---
I hate to see the game update struggles that are happening and no clear acknowledgement from them of the biggest areas that need finishing and fixing. 
---
I swear, whoever they had design their launcher is an idiot or saboteur.
---
Yup nicely done .. little weird with the whiteboard, but effective, glad to see the game is getting some positive reviews as well.
---
OP revised his post as a result of my input supporting AA is slightly better.
---
Help sections usually reserved for technical issues, and/or technological problems your grandparents can't figure out. Without looking at them, I'm betting they don't detail player trade interactions/menus, or C.A.M.P. instructions. Stuff you actually need in game as a new player.
---
For the most part, there's a lot of stuff you don't need more than between 75-100 of. Like glass, ceramic and leather. Some of these can be gotten quickly when you need it. 
---
Don't hoard weapons and armor thinking they will be good later. You will be able to make these and probably better than what you find. Scrap for the chance to learn.   
---
Don't hog ammo you aren't using. And don't stress about tossing it away. But it in containers around the world and delight in knowing someone else might have use for it.   
---
That was such a disappointing DLC.  You had iconic buildings on the skyline you couldn't get to, and the only real-world location that was available was the Cathedral of Learning.
---
You‚Äôve been playing since a month after launch?   That‚Äôs two months more or less.   Just say ‚Äòtwo months.‚Äô  And while Bethesda employees do follow reddit, they‚Äôre going to do whatever they feel like doing, which most likely means throwing kerosene on the economy‚Äôs current dumpster fire state.  Your soapboxing would find better footing if you opined to your parents how they SHOULD have given you RDR2 for Christmas.
---
I am glad to see someone say this. I been thinking for a while that duping has been hiding the fact that the economy, and the combat mechanics in this game, are completely broken. To me, it seems like both of these things have been starting to show over the past few weeks. 
---
Sure, we can not be childishly naive if we  can also manage to not label all who enjoy PVP as "griefing pitiful arseholes".
---
The most dangerous enemy in the game are other players. Regular enemies do not kill me, ever. I recall two deaths to standard mobs since I have been playing. One was to a mirelurk queens acid pre-adjusted. The other was when I fell into a fissure. That is it. All enemy AI is easily exploitable. Climb a tree and suddenly 75% of all enemies cannot harm you. I do not find it challenging or fun. You do find them challenging and fun, that's fine. To each their own. Players pose a bigger challenge to me. It's why I like fighting them. I am happy I will be getting a PVP mode because nobody ever joins Hunter/hunted and rarely do high level people take workshops. Only time I get attacked at a workshop is when I am lower level.
---
I admit, I was aware of that one when I posted. Not my thing, but from what I've read the flamethrower is also underperforming. Was that the bundle with the multicoloured fairy lights? I wanted those but wasn't dropping 2000 on them.
---
Now we know why Katnis Everdeen can one shot anything with her arrow. I remember that scene when she one shotted the hovercraft / vertibot.
---
Oh man. I'm on PC.
---
And Better Inventory Mod! 
---
Maybe if it turns into a motorcycle 
---
&gt; which you have legally already agreed to if you have a Bethesda.net account
---
Not been tested in a court of law as yet so not legally binding. More like a statement of intent.

&gt;You read this tweet, and somehow came to the conclusion that he is an Anti-Vaxxer?

You think so? I think this is the tweet he read.

Recent announcement for DLC coming soon. Hang in there :)
---
Bethesda nerfed camps.
---
I‚Äôm being sarcastic for those of you who couldnt tell.
---
The code mutated
---
SAM turret so i can live.in the bog....
---
It looks to me, and yes, I'm a developer, that when originally released it was hurried, (IKR?), and whomever did it was copying rows. The last couple rows were identical except for the health percentage. If you look at it as the buff you get for the lower you health it should be a consistent curve, but the way it was a cliff at 20%, nothing changed at 10%...with the correction it's now appropriately linear. Hope that helps to clarify! 
---
‚ÄúLook up the formula. It says that you plug in the damage that the weapon does in that fraction. You also use that same number in the end for the multiplier.‚Äù
---
And I‚Äôm telling you that that statement doesn‚Äôt apply to 2 shots. For all single shot weapons it applies because the damage of one projectile equals the damage of the gun, but 2 shots are different. The damage of the gun is equal to 1.25 times the damage of one projectile. It used to be 2 times. 
---
In math, you normalize your multipliers (I have a math degree). What‚Äôs wrong is the wording in the instructions you found. 
---
Nowhere do they specifically state anything about refID. For that you'd have to listen to the modders of this game who all agree with what I am saying.(I actually got my info from modders in the first place).
---
I can't wait to destroy the base of a guy with a 1000 cap bounty and then just throw him the sorry emote
---
Yeah I think too that it is doable. I just believe it is an unreasonable amount of time you would spend dedicated to farming and makeing only ammo, disregarding any other aspect of the game. I don't believe that someone would do that for no reason other than to sit on 100s of thousands of rounds of ammo. It sounds more like he found a glitch or a way to duplicate ammo and then make as much as possible before it gets fixed so that he never has to worry about it anymore. Sounds in my opinion much more likely.
---
I have moved the camp machine within the camp green boarder lines many times with no problems in the past. I usually move it onto my camp assembly in a secure area when finished. Also to add, I had moved, rebuilt my camp as it was prior. All my water purifiers were gone, I had to rebuild them. Some things are, were saved, some were not.
---
A sink.  Broken, dirty, clean, I don't care.  I just wanna wash my hands after going to the bathroom. 
---
My wife is from Minnesota 
---
You forgot "yeah no" and "no yeah"
---
Which of course mean the opposite of each other
---
The white board is important because it tells me these people are really hammering away at this in real life. No flashy graphics to distract me from what they're saying or not saying, just real people in a real office working on real problems, AND giving us realistic, and reasonable timelines.
---
Not to mention that game is fun and I've not seen any issues yet. No crashes, no inventory problems, no 'everything that killed Fallout 76 for me'.
---
As much as everyone shits on this game they knocked it out of the part with world design.  I'm from Kentucky and would be over the moon if they chose it as a future expansion.  All of the Free States Lore was especially awesome!
---
Just happened to me today.... Very frustrating indeed.... 
---
Nope, mine worked fine last night. Try taking it off, closing the game, going back in and re-equipping.
---
Yeah same. I picked up about 700 frag grenades and feel stupid that I had gotten so lucky. I still don‚Äôt know what dupe means. 
---
Just wondering if Anti Armor prefix only works for ballistic? What about energy and radiation damage? example : Radium rifle, Plasma, Cyro. These weapons have both balistic and energy/radiation damage.
---
I mainly only keep junk in my stash because that's what you lose. If you want to fast travel you going to have to keep other stuff. Get rid of stuff like bones, corn, cloth etc, all easy to find and only keep bundles of 10. I like to bulk everything as it keeps it neatly organized for me, I just wish everything could be bulked.
---
Get rid of any non star weapons and 1 star weapons, sell them as they mostly useless, keep stuff for challenges. Get the weight perks for food/aid etc.
---
I do
---
But mostly its around my kids and goes something like, "Oh shiii...I mean cripe"
---
Thanks for the advice I‚Äôll give it a try!
---
So according to your formula, the damage should be 1.56 times as much sighted as it is through vats. It‚Äôs not. That‚Äôs how we know that it‚Äôs the per projectile damage that‚Äôs used in the multiplier. 
---
Tried it and it doesn't work. Scrapping crafted hatchets don't unlock any mods sadly :-(
---
Just an FYI that we're looking into this now and will update when we have more info
---
Lol, you are a salty bastard hey?
---
I've been looking at the files for the Rider armors since the beta. The textures and models have been there this whole time. I'm gonna be grinding atoms and watching very closely for them. Even if I can only get one, I'm getting Black Rider.
---
There is nice stuff in the Atomshop! You might want to visit that....Did I mention the Atomshop yet? /s
---
Today,After attempting 4 times, no camp, I rebuild my camp as it was, the way I like it at the moment. All my water purifiers were gone. I had to rebuild them. As well as a few other misc. stuff. Is this a new thing?
---
Sorry you're dealing with this shit, man. The fanboys on this sub are frothing at the mouth and doing all kinds of mental gymnastics to convince themselves that bethesda can do no wrong, despite their history of fucking up at basically every turn with this game.
---
Aw well you got my upvote.

If it was like an instanced PvP battle that others could watch, maybe inside a Vault with robot vendors where you can place bets on participants? Might actually reinstall for that...
---
Lol no
---
Ever heard of an un-nerf in video games? Nah me neither
---
Haha yeah... I get it. I dont agree with a lot of what they do. I just think he gets blinded by his own bias. 
---
I remember seeing some strange light in the distance. Decided to shoot it for the hell of it, and suddenly a level 30 mothman teleports behind me. It was personal though :(
---
I hate to say it but..
---
I think each time 900 guy is referenced in social media, to include Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, it‚Äôs just fanning the flames of his ego, and giving him the attention  he needs to sway his position against Bethesda.
---
There maybe algorithms right now trending this to see if it all this negativity is enough to push his agenda, and get him back his access.
---
This will be my last post responding to, about the guy and will begin hiding or blocking related content on my feed.
---
Good luck.  
---
Just happened to me I had to turn fallout off and watch some Netflix to cool off lol
---
The game has had problems, but like I said personally I never saw it as a train wreck. most of the glitches and bugs either I never ran into or were graphical and didnt really affect anything. I think I ran into invisible enemies twice since playing and an unkillable mole rat once. have people hit glitches and bugs more often? sure, and maybe even enough for them to view it as a train wreck. I havent.
---
I ran into invisible enemies in world of warcraft (phasing issue. not sure what the hell was going on) once as well. should I start yelling that game is a train wreck too?
---
Frankly the NPC's have never been a big draw for me. I enjoyed the exploration and discovery side of fallout. sure they. can make the world feel "alive" but this world is dead. the raiders and responders fought to the point the raiders blew up the dam, free states were thinned out but scorched raids and the brotherhood recuriting then the brotherhood nukes fissure prime and a swarm wipes out whoever is still living at that time. as far as I veiw NPC's they are just walking holotapes that say hello. they dont make a game good anymore then not having them makes a game bad.
---
whoa whoa activision... i don't know which is worse. activision murdered blizzard
---
The thing is, he DID in some ways cheat. You or those youtubers or journalists wouldn't know but anyone who actually play the game would immediately come to a conclusion that 400k ultracite ammo is a near impossible amount and there's no way that OP obtained said ammo legitimately, even with 900 hours of playtime. Anyone defending this guy and talking shit about Bethesda for this is coming from reading an internet article or some youtube videos and it's kinda pissing actual players off. This subreddit is already plagued with these cheaters crying innocence and this much attention and support on a thread like this is a real letdown
---
if you can handle westtek i usually walk out of there with about 600 steel, and can clear the place in about 20 min, server jump and repeat, hit 2000 steel in roughly an hour.. put scrapper on before you scrap anything and most weapons give 12 steel. (also most have gunpowder on em, i very seldom ever have to craft powder).  
---
lead go to lucky hole mine in excavator armor, 1 ore = 5 lead scrap, i have pulled 387 ore out of one trip in there. usually average 250ish since im not scouring it completely. usually takes about 20-30min to run lucky hole, lil longer if youre wanting to find every single node..   
---
acid is about only thing that slows me down but in off times i go for anything with acid and usually dont have too much issue keeping myself crafting ammo.
---
The 1001 Glitches video by Joseph Anderson is a good analysis of the technical issues in the game by someone who played 100 hours. It's 3 hours long but it's a fair analysis of the technical state of this game by someone who is a Fallout fan. It's easy to see as the issues stack up why people have strong feelings about this game. It really is a title where the more hours you play and the more hours you play in a row the technical issues wear you down like the rubber on a racing tire. The issues add up and compound the more time you spend so that even the small problems when taken as a whole leave the impression of a game released a year too early.
---
lol a basic headlamp the same as our original stock headlamp.....
---
I think the devs just need to take out the any stat bonuses whenever they release some outfits etc; that will solve the problem.  And I bought the inspector outfit because it looks nice, not because of the bonus stat that will expire in few weeks.
---
Not even legendary...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I third this!
---
Because we are in r/fo76
---
Well there goes that pipe dream then. Thanks for giving more info!
---
I‚Äôve been wondering about this. I have a model of a Mr. Handy and a Protectron, and I‚Äôd like to display them and my multitude of bobble heads in my camp.
---
I understand but don't buy it. In their dupe purge post they clearly stated that they are flagging accounts with 100000+ of a given item at a given time. Otherwise the number would have far exceeded for most players for most kind of ammo. It doesn't make sense. Hell, in one post he said that Bethesda probably counts XP as items, wth 1 pt = 1 item. That it clearly not the case, and at this point, looks like a desperate attempt to prove his innocence. While you can be innocent until proven guilty, once proven, remain so till you can prove otherwise. 
---
Trade ? 
---
I would say it was recent with the people who jumped at the opportunity to try and  and very face after they got banned for duping. Coming up with the most outlandish excuses and when people start digging into their claims and profiles they go silent.
---
What I like is how the CM's response about how (s)he's going to check if this was intended with the patch kind of implies that they found out the nerf to adrenal reaction totally was intended. 
---
My understanding is that cells are location based zones of various sizes.  For example when you walk upto a location it populates critters/enemies for you to encounter there.  This is going off early comments from folks that modded fo4, fits what I've seem at least.
---
Ever since that monster mask showed up in my inventory, it never pops for me.  Not sure when or why I got it.  I can't put it in my stash either.
---
&gt;You must be a child. Most of us don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúwork‚Äù in a game after working for 8 hours. Why should I have to work when I‚Äôm the customer?
---
So playing the game is now considered work? That is an interesting view to have. It is particularly laughable because there are many games that require much more work then FO76 does.  
---
&gt; The business I‚Äôm patronizing broke it, but I need to work to fix it? 
---
And they presented a fix but you have been unwilling to participate in it. 
---
&gt; Picture this, you‚Äôre in McDonald‚Äôs and an employee breaks the only chair  left in the dining room. He looks at you and says, ‚ÄúSucks to be you, I  guess you could put it together if you want to sit down and eat.‚Äù That  is what this is. 
---
More accurate example the chair breaks and you fall back spilling food all over the floor. They offer to make room at another table by asking a person/people who are already done eating to hurry make space. Asking you to go up to the register and collect replacement for your food. You instead demand the seat you were in is fixed right away because you will not accept sitting anywhere else. You also declare getting more food to be far to much work and demand all the food that was split all over the floor be made edible for you right away. 
---
I only do get the daily caps and atoms, and then play different games, or do something else.  Don't expect too much for new content till mid-later this year... but if you are a fan of pvp content, come back on March.
---
Nice, I consider crackdown to be one of my favourite first games I ever played, I just can't bite the bullet as the graphics look incredibly dated for 2019. I loved it when I played 1 &amp; 2. I was blown away when they made 2 because I never thought it would happen, but I am just not sold on 3 yet. I might do the trial for the game pass and give it a try before I buy. Not sure it is my style of game any more as well, my tastes have changed, but you right, real people working out real problems and more importantly communicating back to the player base.
---
Never actually seen them used outside of early games of tag with folks.
---
This is the one thing I would actually buy Atom Shop points for. It‚Äôs a shame it was a temporary paint.
---
Big help too!
---
No. The person actually typed it in a message to my gamertag.
---
If your on PC, always looking for shotgun shells  :-)
---
If she floats, she's a witch. If she drowns, well then she wasn't a witch.
---
That makes sense then, I totally missed the comment about XP. That sounds like a wild claim.
---
Woah, might have to us PA for the first tine! These are real creative 
---
You are the gaming equivalent of an anti-vaxxer
---
Hello, I'd run from both....
---
You have to scrap the ad hoc blueprint in the stored tab in order to free the individual components that make it up. Once you do that, you won't consume resources rebuilding when you are placing your bare-bones blueprint instead.
---
Lmao what even is the point of this post. The game was a shit show at launch, followed by stupid decisions from bethesda and again followed by more stupid decisions. It Just keeps on giving more controversial drama, which viewers gobble up hence youtubers make videos about fo76. 
---
And yes activision and ea didn't meet the expectancy for some games but this isnt the main reason for their stock decline. No their stock decline was in-line with the entirety of NASDAQ.

I use the Tesla or exploding a lot for tagging at nuke sites. Sometimes  I hit the same person repeatedly. I have only been killed once as revenge. Don't clear loot until the fight stops, so if you die it's no big deal.
---
More architectural plans
---
- bay windows
---
- ability to do floor bump-outs to break up the exterior facade
---
- more roof sections (glass, smaller sections to create an eve)
---
- a wall section with floor to ceiling windows
---
Methods to display magazines, bobble heads, and other collectibles like a display case for armor, weapons (like in Skyrim)
---
More budget would be wonderful as well.
---
Nailed it. 
---
it wasn't a lie but they were late to the party lol
---
I gave this response earlier to someone who was worried about being banned. "Bethesda has stated in their emails that the suspensions are due to the player acquiring over 100,000 of one, or more, rare in game items within 30 days of game play. Based on that, a player could theoretically drop, and then pick up a rare tse shotgun 100,000 times, as long as they had initially acquired the shotgun 31 days of game play ago, and they did not acquire any other "rare" items during that 30 days. But, it they dropped it and picked it up one more time, they would trigger Bethesda's algorithm, and get a (suspension). Also, based on Bethesda's statement, a player could craft 50,000 pieces of ultracite ammo, drop it, then pick it back up, and they would not trigger Bethesda's algorithm, as long as they did not acquire any other rare items during that 30 days of game play. But, if that player crafted, dropped, then picked up 50,000 pieces of ultracite ammo, and then got a rare tse shotgun as a drop from a legendary mob, that should theoretically trigger Bethesda's algorithm, and they would get smacked with the ban hammer. The scenerios I described are based on Bethesda's use of the word "acquire" in their email, and their description of "over one hundred thousand of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of game play. I am taking "acquire" to imply crafted, bought, looted, or picked up from a bag or container. I am also making an assumption based on my understanding of their game engine, along with statements they have made regarding lost inventory items, that they cannot uniquely track each rare items on an individual basis, which makes me assume their algorithm is only capturing how many times any "rare" item enters a players inventory. One of the biggest problems in understanding if you are at risk for a ban, stems from the fact that I have no idea what they consider a "rare" item. But, it would appear that ultracite ammo and fluxes are considered rare items. It is also possible that fluxes and orbital strike beacons are both considered rare, and that the algorithm is counting both the rare materials used to craft a rare item, as well as the rare item itself. I've only seen one example of a letter from Bethesda, stating to a player, what items served as a trigger for a suspension, and since there is no way to know what items were actually in the player's account, their is no way to work backwards and determine how Bethesda's algorithm actually works. Additionally, the letter that I saw gave me the impression that certain types of ammo were the trigger, however, it seemed very odd that someone who was dupping massive amounts of rare ammo didn't seem to have any other rare items in their inventory."
---
yeah, i found a thread exposing him too
---
The first sentence of the video is "Bethesda is selling non-cosmetic items in their shop". That's not a lie?
---
It was definitely in one of the more ridiculous bundles, yeah.
---
Have you SEEN the plan for the PvP mode??
---
Dear god man, how blind can one person make themselves to issues?
---
Look, you go enjoy it. I'm happy enough as "a lesser skilled player" (until you meet me, then there'll be fun) and you do your thing. All four of you.
---
I would try torso as well. Head shots are weird.
---
heh, thanks :)
---
Why would I have faith in any announcement from Bethesda? They have proven countIess times that their promises regarding Fallout 76 mean nothing. Therefore I am not in the least interested in reading what they ‚Äúplan‚Äú to do with FO76. I ought to believe improvements, if/when it actually happens, not a second earlier.
---
Negativity generates clicks, unfortunately.
---
There are SO MANY games out today and coming out, it's telling when people would rather rail on Fallout than just play something else.  I saw Yong Yea talking about the +15 hp thing and rolled my eyes.  I generally like his reporting but was perplexed by how this was such a big deal.  Especially since it ended already.
---
I think this error happens when you place your camp machine into a spot that had been bulldozed by the build function. When the game loads, it loads the map and then tries to place your camp. If the machine is at a spot taken by a rock or log, or whatever, it can't place. If I get time tonight to play I will test it out.

Reading between the lines and doing some analysis of the HP levels, roughly, perhaps the new values were being applied, WITH an additional effect multiplier when hungry/staving? (Perhaps due to additional HP loss due to the Starvation effect enhancing the Buff effect?)
---
K. You‚Äôre right, everyone‚Äôs innocent, no one dupped fuck Bethesda. 
---
Occam's Razor. I don't believe the guy crafted 100,000+ ultracite ammo. he must have duped or bought from a duper
---
once an item has been given a in-game boost its no longer just a cosmetic.
---
Two shot and Explosive were nerfed a while back, if this is in regards to it being even lower, try un-equiping and re-equiping your perks something to do with logging and power armor.
---
Thanks for the info but it still doesn't answer my main question. Why do you need to make ultracite ammo and even better, why do you need so much? Is there a secret meta I'm not understanding?
---
Me and my family often like camping, but we live in Canada. I think we want to start going camping in some places down in the states so I told them we gotta try out WV.
---
I‚Äôm still a teen so I can‚Äôt go there myself but I‚Äôve recommended the state to my parents.
---
This is all fascinating math but picking up a bag of duped items is far much easier and realistic solution than this
---
You are the one who said it‚Äôs work, I‚Äôm just agreeing with you. A workaround and a fix isn‚Äôt the same thing. The workaround isn‚Äôt even working for everyone. Your analogy makes no sense at all. I paid for a product, I just want it to work right. 
---
Reset all special and break apart stacked cards.
---
It should be tested on players and enemies, because we don't know for sure if armor and resistance calculations are consistent between the two.
---
Do you have Grounded mutation now? Gauss rifle is considered an energy gun
---
Wonder if "900 hour guy" is just a character they created on their own account and had their staff play? 
---
They need to make a side quest for collecting one of each type of bobblehead and upon completion you get rewarded with a static bobblehead display case. One item, nothing removable from it but just to showcase that you collected them all. 
---
I'd also love something similar for magazines and most of all.
---
I desperately want the mounted monster heads as rewards for killing boss monsters in each region. Kill a crowned giant Sloth, receive a mounted Sloth head plaque for your camp. Same with deathclaw, mirelurk queens etc. All these models already exist in game now in a cabin in the toxic valley. They need to be rewards. It would be so cool to look in others camps and see what creatures they've defeated so far. 
---
I'm glad I got to see this.
---
What exactly is your issue from patch 6, apart from Adrenal Reaction breaking? 
---
I knew I was saving my caps for something!
---
I was exaggerating when I said nobody. I don't believe I should have to state that, but here we are.
---
Yes, two skins I didn't mention were indeed the chrome Fatman and minigun. I've got nothing against either, same goes for the 44. I don't use pistols, but as I said they appear to be underperforming. I'm glad some people are enjoying the weapon skins.
---
The woodland camo is certainly overdone, though. I can't speak for the hunting rifle, but I've seen enough people in PA wearing it to know that it doesn't work. The scale of the pattern is wrong, the camouflage ought to disrupt the edges, instead it highlights them. From what I saw in the preview for the hunting rifle, it was similar.
---
I don't get it, apply what multipliers?  Obviously TS has higher base damage... that's all it does.
---
I never said you had too. 
---
You believe what you want. You see things the way you want.
---
You be as upset over a game as much as you want. Don‚Äôt read anything and keep complaining and being you.
---
was going to a friends, no buses today thanx to the weather.  HA!
---
I like to think that Raiders would have PA made out of the remains of cars. I want to see Corvega power armour.
---
I have been killed and lost caps while in passive mode. And, no, I did not fight back; nor was I in a workshop setting. I was at my camp minding my own business. 
---
The current construct is not working for those of us who do not wish to participate in PVP play.
---
I can‚Äôt do the event Battle Bots without getting multiple hundreds of Flamer fuel. Check it out and see if it tops you off
---
There IS a stealth nerf for Adrenal Reaction in this patch, [https://despotak.github.io/fallout\_76\_patch\_notes/v1.0.6.0.html](https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/v1.0.6.0.html) has details, but it  was messed up, and apparantly hunger / starvation enhances the nerfed buffs. 
---
Were you fighting with a group by that little shack??
---
Or go all out and get Four Horsemen by Metallica... 
---
The event ended, and it was 5 hp per person. It was an event. Please don‚Äôt have a stroke
---
I think that'd be cool. I just don't think the current armors are out of place either I guess is all.
---
OP, it's ok that you're a simpleton moron.  I don't judge you for it (much).
---
The item itself has NO BOOST. You can fo wear the Grognak costume now and it dies nothing in the game. It was a one week promo!
---
The week after, having more party members gave you more health. That also was a boost. The week before, carrying toys gave you health. The week before, your health regened at night. These are in game events and have nothing to do with the items themselves. Stop regurgitating what you learnt from YouTube. 
---
Details pls 
---
Still later in the day? I live closer to New Castle but work in Butler. Roads were absolute shit this morning but fine on my way home.
---
Just do line in the sand event for ScorchBeasts 
---
Game Pass is pretty rad.
---
I didn't play the first two. I was literally just looking for a game that two friends and I could play coop and not hate. We tinkered with Strange Brigade, which is pretty fun and totally underrated. Then I downloaded Crackdown 3 to test out. It reminds me of 'Infamous', but it has so much personality. Even just running around the city collecting the orbs is fun. I've only played a little bit, but we were talking about it at lunch and I want to play more, so that's something.
---
The only one I can see as being out of place is the "toys" one or the Santa Claus one.

Welcome to News From Weeks Ago!, brought to you by Fake Outrage, the number one sponsor of YouTube videos. 
---
For more videos like this, be sure to subscribe to r/fo76 where this video was posted a dozen times today alone!
---
&gt;  The simple answer is Bethesda checked his inventory (as they said they did when they eliminated duped items)
---
Alright, let's go over this one again. No "fake math", no convoluted reasoning, just basic reading comprehension.
---
First, for reference, here's the follow up email Mr. 900 Hours received: https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz
---
Now the quote you want to pay attention to is:
---
&gt; We have determined that this account has acquired over 100,000 (one hundred thousand) of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of game play.
---
Look at the mention of days: "within 30 days of game play." Not "the last 30 days", as in a date range, but indicating a duration. Why would you need a duration if it was as simple as checking player inventory and seeing that they currently had 100k+ of a rare item? Answer: you wouldn't. Duration isn't needed if you're just checking an instantaneous total.
---
OP claims they got it from scrapping though?
---
I like the soups that refill both hunger and thirst, I am not sure if the spoil timer is different for soups but I rarely have them go bad.  
---
I think that's an oversimplification. 
---
Have a good time now!
---
I think you're freaking out a lil bit here lol
---
They released these unstoppables cosmetics, and for the following week or so, youd get a really small hp boost for everyone in your party with one on. The ho boost event is over, has been for a couple of weeks, but the cosmetics are still there, and offer no special bonuses
---
Radio
---
time frame is no matter no different than buying an xp potion in some other game. its gone in a short time.
---
 Babies. The good stuff should be very rare and it is. Now the dupe thing is mostly fixed we can get on with the game.
---
 Nearly all the Legendaries in Fallout 4 were garbage, I only used one in 800+ hours, because it was funny. The .45 kneecapper pipe gun I turned into a .38 full auto one. The cheapest most common ammo in the game and I could hose down any damn thing and stick it to the ground.
---
 i have an Instigating Lever Action I got off Wallace, a low level Combat Shotgun with a double mag and the explosive effect. A OSE. ;) I and found a Furious Cyrolator  on a Scroched. I'm on my third char with maybe 140 levels among them. Seems about right
---
Fallout 76 finds the one fan they have with 900+ hours, Bethesda cannot believe that and a ban hammer ensues.  **Funny as fuck that even Bethesda doesn't believe they have a dedicated player base anymore.**
---
I hate to burst your bubble, but this is not Bethesda listening to what players want, this is not them ditching the kiddie/silly aesthetic that most of their cosmetics have, these suits have been in the game files for a long time now.
---
I just thought they buffed the gats firing rate last patch, didn't know it was a bug :(
---
have you read some of his posts in this topic?  He's going a little too hard.
---
Check Youtube for someone parroting the rest of the haters and suggesting they go here.  I've seen quite a few of these low effort posts, mostly posting that same video.
---
Maybe he's hurting on views and is trying to drum up more business?
---
huh?  i got three of them, all are 20%.  so looks like i get rid of 2 of them.  bummer.
---
I have not watched the video, but that is old news. You can get one costume from playing the game for free, it was a short event (that is over now) and the buffs were very minor in the grand scheme of things. Now, is this a step in the wrong direction...? Probably. But if this is as bad is it gets for being "pay to win", it isn't something that bothers me personally.
---
Well it‚Äôs ammo is really heavy so I‚Äôm not surprised if you‚Äôve passed it up but you can actually fire it in the air for an actual flare which other people will see and most likely come over to see what‚Äôs up. It also attracts NPCs and lights up dark caves which can be useful. 
---
Yeah.  Plague is better than Conquest though I think as far as how it presents to the player, and it riffs off Nurgle so that's cool.   
---
I just basically think of the Johnny Cash song every time I hear pale horse, pale rider.
---
Am I missing something?

That pic depicts a doctor punching her patient for NOT vaccinating her kid?

Yong must be out of material, making outrage videos about stuff that ended weeks ago.

What console are you on?

If it‚Äôs xbox I can make you free serums

I don‚Äôt play anymore, have abundance of flux and shit on hand though

&gt; He's using macros. That's why it's more or less incomprehensible for a console player to be able to do what he does. You can't use scripts in console gaming.

My thinking would be he makes more than he uses, makes to keep friends supplied so less down time due to them farming needed mats to craft their own, also its better than caps.. caps cap @ 25k.. ammo doesnt.. wants to buy a good armor peice offer up 30 to 50k ammo to someone that uses that ammo they dont hit the cap limit and have something they can use.. 
---
Meta in this game is gonna turn into ammo dealers and ammo as the main form of currency as people acquire all their plans and have nuttin to spend it one other than fast travel and their caps hit limit.. 
---
Ive made tons of 5.56 ammo and until recently i never carried a handmade.. i have more playtime than my friends so i farm and craft while waiting for them, then if they run out mid scorchqueen fight "i got ya heres 2k 5.56"
---
It's one if the materials that the dupers and cheaters amassed fraudulently, with their OP weapons and armor, which in turn enabled them to craft mass amounts if the best ammo, serums, etc. Then they sold these for caps to fraudulently obtain the best plans.
---
Of course the temp account suspensions fixed that, right? The playing field is level, right? 
---
To be fair, no one is saying that the Unstoppables event was in any way a huge step toward p2w, but it is something. Before the game launched, Bethesda promised cosmetic only micro transactions. While these items went back to only cosmetic after the week long event, during that time you had to pay real world money for an in game buff. This may not be straight up p2w but it does prove Bethesda lies about the atom shop. There have already been files data-mined showing the lunchboxes coded for atom shop releases, why take the chance? These are shown to include in game buffs that could mean the difference in a full team pvp scenario.
---
Gamers have made a lot of progress in showing companies like EA that we don‚Äôt want to be their personal piggy bank. Why is a large portion of this community fighting that change? What has Bethesda ever done to earn your unquestionable loyalty? They are a commercial business and will exploit you for every dime they think they can. You attacking others for trying to speak out against what they see as dishonest and unsatisfactory additions to a game only proves that Bethesda can exploit there customers for greed.
---
Level 450?? meanwhile the last time i stopped playing was when i was sub 20. never gonna get that level 50 achievement
---
*per se
---
No one is saying? Literally all of YouTube is saying. Look at Yongyea and his pals.
---
This game imo suffered from two fatal flaws. 
---
It wasnt just that it wasnt beta tested long enough, but they dont have a beta/testing server before they go live with fixes. Every time we get hyped for a fix it inevitably breaks things and people get more and more frustrated with it and understandably so  
---
But most of all this game should have had two modes from the very beginning. Had the game started with a pve only story mode and then a pvp mode I think it could have been much more successful. Pvp mode would have had much more limited resources so you had to fight others to build up your camp, maybe arena style battles you could pay caps to join in (think like the Pitt in fallout 3) and youd grind your way up playing for good gear and weapons to fight in the arena for prizes and a leader board. Pvp servers could have had factions and events specifically tailored to that style of game play.
---
This way the pve players explore the map and story unbothered and the pvp players get to roleplay raiders and beat the piss out of eachother in a completely different style game mode using the same assets and map. 
---
Ugh I was just there and the ghouls were disappearing as soon as they hit the ground so I couldn‚Äôt loot them üò≠
---
Ref Data on Adrenal Reaction changes:  
---
I dunno, I like this kind of stuff too. I have a discord with other people who use their characters as test dummies for simple mechanics like this. 
---
Give someone on here your Stuff if your Quiting share the love man!
---
Yes, it's a poor development decision to put apples into the menu AFTER the apple-loving playerbase has already left the game. That's pretty basic common sense.
---
&gt;This is online game and people who play online game like challenging content, not some bullsh#t SBQ.
---
I can't roll my eyes hard enough.
---
Likely. I agree with you completely. It was supposed to be a fun little thing and now everyone is crying THEYVE GONE P2W!!!! Dhiandbsjssnfhjwjsjf nooooooooooooo
---
Seriously. It‚Äôs a damn costume
---
Journalists just want to have something bad to say about 76, just like they have from release.
---
They don‚Äôt care that BGS is banning actual dupers and cheaters to make the game better, they just want to rag on the game to get more clicks, even if it means not researching the topic or being ignorant to certain things. 
---
That‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs a graveyard smash
---
I'm on XBox but there was a change in the code to the Adrenal Mutation itself and I don't think a new Serum works? All info is conflicting but if you're willing I'll give it a go
---
But what if after all this time since the beta, all you haven't said is "fuck Bethesda". What if we've tried to be productive, defended against unfair criticism, tried to be productive..
---
"Fuck Bethesda" is a clear message from those who have stuck it out longer than most, but feel completely hopeless about the future of this game.
---
Also, when they ban users, but in the same stroke they tell users "we don't care" when it comes to wanting an explanation.
---
They've completely destroyed this community, the majority of the player base has jumped ship.. they should have seen and responded to the discontent long before anyone had to say "fuck Bethesda".
---
Sounds like reason to avoid the game!
---
That and a hundred thousand other reasons.
---
I made this in paint XD i was trying to do the interactive map in java script or html but that isnt my strong suit
---
&gt;If you‚Äôre still playing Fallout 76, you‚Äôre just asking for a ban!
---
Ok mongoloid.
---
Yeah - I'm feeling  the same. I've stuck with it to level 76 but just about had it. I think Bethseda should keep their day jobs at Mc Donalds.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have bought merman
---
Matter of fact right now i have 28k 5mm in stash and no one i run with uses minigun anymore since nerf..
---
But even before nerf i was .50 cal sniper/shotty.. carried usually 10k 5.56 just for helping friends out.. go below 10k id start makin more so i had em covered.. benefit was theyd go outta their way to get me plastic and give me any shells they found since they didnt use shotties.
---
imo I really like the mothman one.
---
Sorry this happened to you man. Don‚Äôt let the mob get you down.
---
Most people can‚Äôt get it into their heads that the ammo amounts the email listed weren‚Äôt actually in your stash or in your characters‚Äô inventories. 
---
I think that‚Äôs the fundamental misunderstanding that‚Äôs turned some people against you, but I for one think something else is going on here, and support your journey to get this clarified by Beth.
---
no they pulled that then put it in the shop for a few weeks, like the "50% off" stuff that was never the "full price"
---
I really hope it gets sorted glorf. It all really blew up so fast and shit got nasty. 
---
If it doesn't work out, I'll miss ya, and hopefully you'll find another game to sink hours into and pass the time while you're injured. Save your sanity of boredom. Try gw2, hella fun.
---
My friend and I were in the process of claiming the Poseidon power plant. Were were like 99% done. All was left to do was power it up on the outside I think. I say I think because it was our first time doing it. We were confused as hell throughout the whole process and what was where.  I noticed another player pop up in the map at the same location. The guy ends up doing the last step. 
---
My friend wanted to claim it back and kill him but we noticed we were able to take fusion cores without getting wanted. Dude locked it also. He ends up going to the east side of the map. We stayed and kept taking cores and expected the guy to come back and pvp but he never did. Dude was an a-hole for taking it after we did all the work but in the end, he didn‚Äôt care or notice. 
---
We already have the object, but I wish we could actually play pool on the pool table. 
---
I'd also love to be able to cook and place down a big food item, then consume parts of it (similar to cakes from Minecraft)
---
Did that ghoul happen to kill you any before you killed it?
---
See, I agree with you here, but I think the week promo w/Unstoppables is still worth some skepticism.  
---
It could be them first testing the waters on non-cosmetic benefits to Atomic Shop items. It could be the whole "frog in boiling water" scenario where they start with a few small things, and it grows over time.  
---
Not trying to get all tinfoil hat over here, I do think the outrage at the time was overblown, but I think it's something we should keep in the back of our mind in case these "limited" promotions keep growing in size.  
---
Well thought out post. Solid math and explanation of reasoning. 10/10 quality post. Have saved and upvoted. 
---
I thought about building there too and incorporating the flag pole - glad to see someone did it!  Looks awesome!
---
So do they no longer provide the bonus?
---
It'll probably have to be tomorrow, I have it off work
---
Unless you're online in 7-8hrs
---
I have no idea of the issues myself, still subbed here awaiting better days... They don't look like they're coming any time soon though D=
---
I‚Äôll fourth this, later bro.
---
You can keep buying XP boosts. You can't use this boost anymore. That's the difference. 
---
The game has barely been out 3 months, and 220k ultracite is extremely fishy. That‚Äôs one of the hardest ammo types to get in the game. 
---
Not me.  The last time anyone tried to grief me was shortly after the game went live. 
---
 Just tired of listening to the complaints online and the imbeciles who are incapable of a semblance of self-reflection. These griefers tend to be cowards in that there seems to be a consistent theme of them targeting low level players, people who are building camps or working on workbenches (so not having perk cards equipped for combat) and people who are set passive. 
---
Since they seem incapable of regulating their own behavior, Bethesda should help them. 
---
I accidentally threw a grenade that blew up a car and killed a guy. He respawned and ran back over.
---
Then I did it again &gt;:)
---
:(
---
Thanks for the response. I guess I‚Äôm back to crouching up and down like a madman. 
---
I don't disagree that it shows Beth's going back on their word (and if you buy into the 'slippery slope' argument, there's that too), but this was such a non-issue that I couldn't even bother to care, and I *despise* P2W bullshit with a passion.
---
It's definitely about YT views at this point, not any serious issue.
---
So do you no longer get the buff for buying costumes?
---
Yeah it's a terrible system. On one of my low level characters I wanted to get a certain clothing item, so I server hopping and invited people to a team who were close to it. As appreciation to the one person in a bunch of server hops who accepted my invite and let me fast travel to the high level area, that I would no doubt have died many times and took a long time getting to, I picked up and gave the item to the person, thinking  will just get another one since I have the fast travel point now. I tried a few times and it won't respawn. FUN! 
---
So anyway. There is maybe one work around but I don't know. I can't be sure how it works exactly or what items share the same "pool". But basically there's a number like 60 and 180. For containers and world spawns. There's some list that keeps track of the items. When you load into an area if those items are still on that list of 60 or 180 and haven't been pushed off by you looting more stuff, then they won't load in. So perhaps, it is just a theory, but perhaps you can speed it up by looting more stuff and server hopping and trying again. I haven't confirmed this theory yet.
---
Nope. It was just for that week. Like the Mothman thing now making Mothman more common in the world
---
Nope. Not at all. 
---
Skepticism and this dirty politics that we are seeing regarding 76 are not the same thing.
---
lol so if they never do it again EVER
---
"I ate too much now I gotta put on stretchy pants to fast travel!"
---
:D
---
Players are so creative its remarkable (This thread itself is evidence). Like the dude who built the Round castle at Whitesprings and so many other things people have built. if we had player created quests there would be some amazing ones out there, of that i have no doubt.  Yes there would be bad, low life quests and other maggot stuff but a net gain.
---
I like the idea of being high level or perhaps the person who creates the quest could set the quest level equal or less than their own. The higher your level the more elaborate the quest you can make.  
---
That's likely the case.  I'm pissed that in the two days I had some family obligations that kept me away from the game they released and took away the Blackbird paint.  I'd have paid full cash price if I had to in order to get that one, one day sales are extremely bad business practices.
---
So what are these Faction Points good for, besides ranking up in an imaginary group?  
---
And I think my questions comes off as a bit dickish, but it's not my intent. Truly curious as to the system you guys have going to keep you involved in the game.  
---
^ this man here has the gist of it.
---
None of this works!!! :(
---
hi
---
I don't think Bethesda every wanted it to be a caps economy, they want people to barter with stuff. That's why the venders have very little caps, mobs drop very little caps, cap stashes have very little caps, bounties are low and there is a 25k limit on caps. 
---
I agree with you on the drop rate need to be increased or at least hard to fight creatures need loot that makes you want to fight them (Scorched Beast, Mirelurk Queen, etc), but I don't think your argument is going to win Bethesda over as they are making caps hard to come by on purpose.
---
Understood. Note that this post is not trying to argue otherwise. The point was to explore if it's possible for a solo player to collect a specific amount of resources in a specific amount of time. During the course of writing it, it became clear that a dedicated group of people could do this rather easily.  
---
We've also seen how solo players using multi-boxing can readily farm this amount of ammo in 30 days.  
---
I think these are important things to know when making one's personal decision as to whether any particular player is using duplication exploits or not, particularly with respect to acquiring ammunition.
---
So basically your argument is that Bethesda *may* do something bad in the future, so let's keep the hate train ready to run.
---
How in the world would this be intended? If so, why was this a thing that needed to be changed?
---
Bethesda has tried it with atom shop - but almost all color schemes and clothes are atrocious and the hair styles should GIVE you atom for using them 
---
20 people posting on a subreddit that represents only a minor fraction of the actual player base = roughly half.  
---
Lol c'mon, nobody is going to take you seriously with that kind of hyperbole. 
---
no this only applies to the one time ever theory.
---
Very very unlikely, but not impossible as claimed above.
---
I'm glad that you had a relatively smooth experience but subjective experience and reframing the argument do not counter hard evidence of widespread defects.
---
Moreover in the case of this game verifying most of the evidence provided does not require anything other than a freely available tool - xEdit - and the time to actually do it by oneself.
---
Again happy that you don't miss meaningful NPC/story interaction or world defining choices and consequences however this does not mean that their absence doesn't reek of poor design and lazy approach to storytelling.
---
You do not, clickbait video is clickbait
---
Is this what this sub has come to? 
---
Protecting Bethesda by falsely claiming someone else is anti-vax?
---
This sub is fucking weird.
---
Getting banned from a subreddit with Casual literally in the title, lmao. Easily one of the nicest and most lenient communities I‚Äôve seen, getting banned from there just makes you look kind of silly. And given you went to another sub to complain about it afterwards.... sheeesh....
---
so you are okay with being able to buy stat increases. Guess youre not as anti-p2w as you thought. While it was just for the even, that is still a bad business practice and hurts the consumer
---
Been around for a while, I like the look of them but just can't wear my rags for combat situations
---
You're a genius.
---
I've heard people claim that, but also hear people claim to have been one-shotted while in passive mode. 
---
&gt; but roughly pc servers down 30% of players I heard. Ps4 and xbox, down a little more than 50. 
---
Where are you "hearing" these stats from? More reddit posts? lol  
---
I actually sorted my stash last night with the extra weight, moved the keeper amounts into the stash and everything on me (with the exception of the really common stuff) is going to get sold.  But I also have a ton of BF.
---
I don't really need 5-600 black titanium, same for screws/springs I'm sure.  The ultracite is a little harder to parse but I'm in the 600+ range on that too.  But mining nodes are pretty common.
---
Come to Morgantown, with the university, Mylan, and the hospital, you hear at least 3 different languages every day. But yeah every other place is what you‚Äôd think of the typical West Virginian. 
---
Considering it has been stated multiple times by Bethesda that the amount of weight on players that exceed what the restrictions are causes problems with server stability and optimization of the game then it's not silly as you violated the rules and cause server issues for everyone else. There was also an exploited that allowed you to have unlimited items and not consequences with weight as well. 
---
I don't care how much you play the game there's no way the 225,000 rounds of ultracite ammo is legit.  Plus the 100's of thousands of other ammo types. Just admi6it dude you duped/used exploit. Man up to it.
---
No, it has been proven by even this OP that TS ADS is counted as 1 projectile.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
There's a perfectly good arena in Pleasant Valley Ski Resort that at the very least they could use for a Versus Event (like the Prickett's Fort battle).
---
Lmao. 
---
Except he doesn't live on the planet Endor, he fought one battle there. Also, Ewoks were originally Wookiees...
---
Also, no need to woooosh me, I know he's quoting South Park. 
---
They aren‚Äôt saying this is game changing. Just that it allows players a significant in game buff. This is about looking ahead, not the one week event. Do you want Bethesda to think the player base is okay with purchasable buffs from the atomic shop, even if they are small like these were? Where do you draw the line between small advantages and p2w exactly? 
---
If me and three friends all bought the game at $60 and another team of four bought the game at $60, but then spent $25 dollars on in game items, why should they have 45 more health than my team? If you can answer this question with anything mother than ‚Äúthey shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù then you are exactly the person who will allow Bethesda to weasel p2w into this game.  Bethesda wanted pvp to play a part in the game, they should have known what that would entail.
---
There is a water fountain on the inside wall of the gazebo, nearish to the firehouse. Drinking from that will cure (looks like all) disease. 
---
You can play for 900 hours over the course of more than 30 days.
---
Did you not read his first post? He is stuck in his house due to an injury and is unable to work or leave his house, he said he was using FO76 to take his mind off how sucky it was to be stuck at home all day when he was used to working.
---
So no if BSG banned him and he was a legit player they didn't do him a favor, they did him a MAJOR disservice.
---
So I switch from a TSE to a bloodied build and then they stealth nerf that as well.
---
They're both 1 star, right? What are both of their damages with standard receivers?
---
It doesn't. And nobody has ever said that it did, because that's not what people were banned for. Take your lazy strawman the fuck out of here. 
---
It's not a bad idea take an upvote, and I hope they do test servers.
---
well not entirely as they did sell a stat increase. It's over but is still should never have been done in the first place. It doesn't matter how minor
---
Fuck the 900 hours guy. He‚Äôs a cheat. He just wants pity. 
---
It's obvious but it's popular for movie, games, and media websites to steal "theories", "stories", and "content" from Reddit and weekly cite it to pass it off as their own.
---
Proudly so :-). Joe Strummer is my favorite philosopher 
---
If you are constantly at your limit of stash and carry weight like me, here are some tips:
---
1. Store all the junk you can't afford to lose when you die. Drop ammo types you don't use. Especially missiles and nukes. Grenades and mines are heavy too if you don't use them.
---
2. Only store stuff that weighs the same in the stash as they do when you carry. So if you have perks that lower the weight of junk, chems, food, armor, and ammo, then stash your extra weapons, gun powder, magazines, bobbleheads, explosives etc. Your storage will be most optimized like that. If you don't have the energy ammo reducing perk, then store your extra fusion cores in your stash. Otherwise, carry them. Basically, you store things where they weigh the least (junk being the exception since you can lose it, you can't lose the rest)
---
3. My junk strategy: Keep all the Black Titanium, Ultracite, Hardened Mass, Stable Flux, Nuclear Material, Fiber Optics, and Ballistic Fiber you get your hands on. It's hard to come by. That said, don't go out of your way to farm/mine those things if you don't have a use for it the moment. For example, don't take the gorge junkyard and extract black titanium for hours if you don't have a pressing need to use it for crafting. But every bit of black titanium scrap you pick up in the world, hang onto, because you will accumulate it so slowly that you won't have a ton of excess when you do finally have a need to use it. Make sense?
---
4. I hang onto about 700 each of screws, gears, and springs. They are used in so many things and can be sold for lots of caps if needed. I always have them tagged to pick up.
---
5. I keep about 100 lead, plastic, steel and wood in my stash. The rest I carry. That way I'm never wiped completely out if I lose my bag. I only carry about 100 more wood and 300 steel, but I carry all the lead and plastic I can find and make ammo every time I see a tinker's workbench until I run out of something. I always try to keep at least 100 plastic in case I need to bulk and sell.
---
6. I keep about 50-100 of everything else except bone, cloth, antiseptic, silver, gold, and other things that don't have much use. I keep a close eye on my scrap usage and when I find myself getting low, I make a mental note and pick up stuff that has it in it. Like yesterday I realized I was getting low on copper so I've been picking up light bulbs and fuses when I see them and I normally don't. 
---
7. Your material needs will change as you level. I hoarded adhesive until I got my adhesive farm up and running. Now I keep less than 100 because I can make it so easily. I don't have a need for antiseptic because I don't craft stimpacks since I find so many and don't use them often. I primarily use food for healing.
---
8. Just keep an eye on what you craft and only collect what you use with a little reserve of everything else.
---
If I give you a dollar and then you give me that dollar back and we do this every day for 30 days, how many dollars have you acquired in that time span?
---
My answer is zero dollars..  What leads you to believe that the answer is 30 dollars apart from a guy (who's probably lying) backpedaling in excuses that vaguely fit new information as to how Bethesda got it wrong?
---
Yeah and lets not forget the fact that Todd and Pete were invading peoples homes and literally forcing them to buy the game which is antykonsoomer and literally robbery of the 76th degree. Plus they literally promised a perfect game without bugs  (I chose not to remember the letter to the fans, or the state of the beta which we all bitched about not being a beta but just early access which was a perfectly clear indicator of what the game was going to be like) so we were all expecting a perfectly polished game day 1. *Especially* following a game like fallout 4 which was universally praised and loved by the hardcore fallout fans on reddit. 
---
And no, we the people who knowingly chose to buy the game despite these things are in no way at fault for buying into hype and fomo and buying the game despite all of the glaringly obvious indicators we were relentlessly bitching about prior to the games release. How the fuck were we supposed to know it wasn't fallout new vegas 2? After 200 hours of pure agony and suffering I DEMAND A REFUND!
---
a) Blatant lie. 1000s of evidence + code shows that slap damage is 5HP only.
---
b) Pacifist mode DOES NOT MAKE YOU IMMUNE TO PVP. You can still be in PvP when in pacifist mode. Pacifist mode means YOU DO NO DAMAGE to anyone. These people claimed a workshop, which flagged them for PvP, and then got hit and took full damage.
---
You will still visually see a stray bullet, but all hits ADS do 125%.
---
My post is purely speaking damage.
---
I got rad worms. *trombone*
---
I did restart the game, yes
---
Thats my exact argument. I can't really defend them anymore. Mistake after mistake. Look at this weeks patch, Adrenal Reaction got nerfed without them telling us. They also told us they will inform us of changes and not "stealth nerf" things. I don't know what the hell happened over at Bethesda but it feels like someone is trying purposely to fail. You can't make this many errors for this long.
---
This is a random event just like One Deadly Night and Lode Bearing with a area notification, with one deadly night you will get a Sons of dane signal found message when it starts if your within range. For Lode Bearing the ground shakes in the ash heap to let you know its going on. For Watoga its the school PA system and its local to Watoga it will mention candy after that you can walk in and trigger the event there is a cooldown for this event as well much like Uranium Fever.
---
When I equip the perk card Strange in Numbers my damage decreases instead of increasing like it should.
---
Work-Around:   
---
Lave all BULK Stacks in your stash and then they will not be affected by Scrap All
---
I super dig the pale rider T-51 that's pretty sick.
---
Okay sure for someone who plays with friends I can see having extra, but the 900 hour guy is solo and 140,000 rounds of ammo is not required to give some ammo to friends. Also ammo is craftible and worth less than a cap in some cases. Also it seems like a waste to make ultracite ammo, of all the ammo you can make, why a one trick pony ammo type and gun. You'd think for people who spend ungodly amounts of time on fallout 76 would use weapons that are good all round. Also Having ammo for a type of ammo you never use seems useless, even if you're on a team being a ammo dealer to your friends 24/7 isn't the best way a fallout 76 major grinder could use his time. But that's just me, a person who sees the potential but reads what people say and think why?
---
I agree that jumping to a new server is sort of a solution, but why should anyone have to do that?  What if someone is about to join a team on that server to go do something?  The people being attacked by the idiots (aka pvp griefers) aren't going anything wrong. 
---
If the griefers want to bully low level players or just bother pacifist players, then let them actually experience some consequences that they don't like.  Bone worms for a day is much better than giving them a bounty that a friend can collect. 
---
It's only a single projectile if it's ADS, and excluding the weapons mentioned in my post.
---
Which is why I said the outrage was overblown.  
---
Oh, nothing has changed in two months?
---
Beth' just open your game up to the modders and let them actually do, for free, what you clearly can't, just do it, cut your fucking loses and move onto your next big embarrassment.
---
I'll be over here playing absolutely anything else, that actually works.
---
I already replied to this through another comment, but can you also provide screenshots?
---
By the way Bethesda counts it? over that 30 day period I would have acquired 30$ in that span, nowhere does the email state they currently have that many items.
---
As for why I know it is like that? Because numerous dupers have come out and said they had characters that literally had nothing left on them banned. So it isn't based on the items they currently have in their inventory, but based on the amount of items they picked up in a 30 day period.
---
Intended! In-flipping-tended!
---
Persecute? Speaking out against a company‚Äôs business practices isn‚Äôt persecution. That‚Äôs called protecting consumers and their money.
---
But it clearly does. I don't get what you think you are seeing
---
No, it is not. His argument is based solely on the fact that mods cannot increase TS damage, which is false.
---
Yup they tried, and F'd it, because something is seriously buffing the new nerfed stats (See OP's screen shots).
---
Plenty of people would love to play on test servers, even without the Atom incentive, simply to add to the stability of the live game.  
---
The problem isn't recruiting people to sign up, it's BGS unwillingness to provide such an environment to begin with.  
---
I'm all for that. Cap the damage inflicted by the griefer, but give them digital herpes if they persist in annoying the other player. 
---
Maybe play Destiny 2 if you need that level of polish. I'm fine with what the game is, and I've actually made friends in this game.
---
Thanks, theres so many games I could play, but only really one that I want to. I'm passing my time playing hearthstone. I guess I just enjoy bashing my head against a wall?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
They actually have stated the 100k number, not just in the above reply to someone but also in reply to others.
---
Additionally, and if I dig I could locate it I'm sure, Bethesda stated in a previous post (I think patch 5 notes?) that they would be looking to ban individuals who have been exploiting, and would do so by looking at how many items those people have and would be banning those who had an impossible to obtain number such as 100k of a rare item.
---
However despite stating they would ban those with that amount of a rare item, they did not say that ammo would somehow make that list.   The person in the thread I linked has stated (read his original post as it was edited day ago) that he has never had that much ammo and believes they were counting the times he has moved the ammo to his mules ect to get to those numbers.
---
Based on the wording in their email response in that thread, evidence is clearly indicative that they are counting all "AQUIRED" rare items of whatever specific type over the past 30 days, then using that number and if it exceeds 100k are issuing bans.
---
I'm not posting based on no evidence, I am posting based on the currently existing evidence.
---
So based on the evidence, Bethesda has more then likely banned Individuals who may have not deserved the ban, despite their intention to not do so.  The reason for defending these people is simple, If Bethesda has in fact banned people who should have not been banned then anyone (including you if you still play) could end up unjustly banned in a future ban wave.  I enjoy the game and would rather Bethesda not outright kill it by banning people who don't deserve it and removing those people from the list of players in the game.
---
So.....based on all of the above, They should at a minimum clarify the bans and be willing to have the bans appealed, looking at the appeals in each specific case to verify the evidence on a case by case basis.
---
LegacykillaHD, juicehead, yongyea. 
---
The unholy trinity.
---
Great idea
---
When in ADS, the TS is treated as a single projectile 125%. I keep telling you this; there is no second shot.
---
That's kind of what I'm wondering. 
---
Feel free to. 
---
It‚Äôs all good. The points are just that for ranking up in the group. They don‚Äôt go towards anything else in game or outside the discord.
---
It‚Äôs a RP BoS discord group. We have three paths for people to choose from.
---
Knights, Lancers and Scribes.
---
Each have different roles in group battles and different rank structures.

But that doesn‚Äôt stop you from playing your own style. There aren‚Äôt any restrictions on gear other than raider and enclave PA is a no no. 
---
In saying that we do have from time to time infiltration missions where we fight all the robots in the Congressional Bunker whilst wearing Enclave gear.
---
They aren‚Äôt easy as the spawn rate for robots is very fast. You eventually get swarmed and have to tactically disengage.
---
But it looks crazy and when other players come into the bunker they freak out with all the chaos going on!  
---
I've been toying with the idea of getting Game Pass, but I have so many games in my backlog as it is. Knowing Crackdown 3 would be / is in GP has kept it in the forefront of my mind for months now. I had so much fun with Crackdown 1, 2 was ok, 3 looks like a (larger / more ridiculous) re-envisioning of 1.
---
Thanks for specifying that you're an old lady, the abundance of caps didn't make it clear enough.
---
Thinking about it- since the Pale Horseman represents death- I think the T-51 skin is supposed to be representing a nuclear bomb in theme; I am become Death.
---
You know that players standing on roof tops and elevated platforms causes her to land a lot less right? And that if she doesn't land often, it's almost impossible to kill her?   
---
I lost my last SBQ fight not because of low-level players, but because of high level dickheads with marsupial mutation spending almost the whole mission on top of one of the sheds out there. Hell, at least those low level guys hiding in the shadows aren't causing her to stay airborne almost the entire time. 
---
No. You never multiply twice. The first time you use damage in the formula, your result is always a decimal. The second time is to apply that decimal.
---
**Use the formula yourself!**
---
Your title simply says that two shot is always better than anti-armor, it says nothing about damage in the title, if your speaking solely on damage then your title is a bit misleading, dont you agree?
---
If it's intended, then someone needs to be fired from writing the patch notes because this was left out.
---
So when a large majority of the player base is using a specific perk, mutation, weapon, etc.. there's a balance issue that needs to be addressed.
---
In this case, Bloodied builds are popular because of the amount of things that will stack for a damage boost. It's necessary because how bullet spongy mobs are. Good Devs would reduce the damage reduction and HP of boss mobs, or increase damage output across the board, and then nerf the *stacking* of certain effects so that previous top end builds still perform the same, but other builds perform more competitively (but still probably not quite as good because of the disadvantage that comes with low HP).
---
*These* Devs, however, just see popular perks/mutations/etc. as a game of whack-a-mole that needs to be smacked down. Probably as a knee-jerk reaction to how quickly so many people hit the end game content. 
---
This is why extensive betas are necessary, so you can identify these kind of issues and nerf them *before* players get used to them. Doing it this way just feels like you're slowly taking away everything fun from the game.
---
Broken 
---
If you'd like to come up with a name of a new disease, just for griefers, which combines all the effects of the other diseases, feel free to take some liberties and add that. :-)
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
I‚Äôm telling you that by your math, vats and non vats have different damage. Clearly they do not, so your formula is wrong
---
Yes, I didn't intend for that. Most people simply say that AA is more powerful than TS, which is what I disproved.
---
That's a REALLY nice setup!!!
---
OK. Thanks for sharing your opinion. 
---
Idk this forum is going see well
---
Um... why would believe dupers claims in the first place? would you believe if they said they was innocent and was wrongfully banned? Dupers would do anything to cause mass confusion among innocent players. 
---
I never played For Honor, so I didn't follow the devs. I did play The Division, and Sea of Thieves, and I followed those developer updates pretty closely. This simply video was better than just about any of the 2 years of "The Division's" 'state of the game' streams...
---
Surely it all depends on the enemy at the time and your build? I've personally found anti armor rifles to be far superior to TS on my rifle build.
---
Protecting from what? A phantom menace? 
---
OK, so looks like Adrenal Reaction was stealth nerfed this patch... but there's a unintended buff on the effects when starving / hungry, so take that for what it's worth. 
---
This is going to force Bethesda to reveal more about his play activities, and he's going to end up looking like a complete jackass and deleting his entire reddit account when it's all said and done.
---
More than a few users of this sub will also join in him jackassery.
---
That it does no more 8 free stimpaks
---
Yes, they have different damages...
---
I've been saying that only in ADS is it considered 1 projectile, while everywhere else is 2. At that point you use 62.5% per projectile.
---
I did. And using your formula, vats shots would only do 2/3 the damage of non vats. You agree this isn‚Äôt true, ergo your formula is wrong
---
I‚Äôve had the opposite experience. I mean I‚Äôve only ever played with two other people at once, but when we‚Äôre doing quests together we just say that we‚Äôre gonna listen to a holotape or read a note and so far, the others have shut up until we were done. 
---
[Heres the patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asat8r/fallout_76_patch_notes_february_19_2019/?utm_source=reddit-android) for you to look through.
---
This absolutely deserves my upvote. I've played since the beta nothing really bothered me ever since except maybe a few bugs. Give Bethesda a chance. I mean they never worked on an online game before and now that they've tried it for the first time people are going to shit on it? Of course it's not perfect but is there any game that is? The game is worth every penny i've spent on it and no dumb ass youtuber is ever gonna change my mind whatsoever.
---
I did some digging back in December and the nifs are there. Problem is they're the new type of nif and I don't know how to view them. I was able to see the textures though, and it looks like they may have gotten improvements since then. https://gyazo.com/f074f405bf2f98694ccb708f90387f7b my evidence.
---
False, i rebuild my mutaci√≥ns and not work
---
15 HP is significant? The buff you got for carrying toys or the health regen at night were way more significant than this.
---
I just replied to you on another comment, read that onez
---
No they don‚Äôt. If I take my 2 shot handmade and compare its killing force in vats vs sighted, it‚Äôs about the same. 
---
It was 400 before the nerf. Sunday it was 260. 
---
 I doubt your ability to script using their engine will help them much. ;)
---
Nice. Love the train use. I've been

I am literally still laughing five minutes later. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yea had same issue, unequip everything and just server hop
---
Maybe something that affects energy weapons?
---
I can't refute either side. There's a player in this thread who swears he was killed in his camp. I've heard other stories that seem to be too straightforward to be made up. 
---
I mean even then the santa clause one can be probably lore explained. Since we know power armor was used as a promotional tool
---
At his rate it's, on average, 16k ammo a day. Or 20 bucks on ebay. 
---
Yeah I got the temporary suspension for this also. Oh well on to bigger and better games
---
Ah seems i have some digging to do didn't see these last time i dumped textures.
---
Believe what you will, but the truth is slap damage is capped. But I repeat, Pacifist mode does not give you PvP immunity, as some people mistakenly think.
---
yeah.  was suppose to go to my friends place today.  was cooking dinner, but like i said,no buses.  it is only a 20 minute walk to get there, but not in this weather!
---
if i may ask, where in butler you work?  i am retired military / otr truck driver.  i live over by the monroe hotel, if you know the place.
---
I'm not sure why people are so confused about this, go read anywhere else in this subreddit. Everyone else agrees after looking into it and talking to the CM's this wasn't about how many items someone CURRENTLY had, because it would make no sense to ban people for their current item numbers right after deleting a crap ton of duped items. That would basically mean the dupe wipe would SAVE dupers. BSG isn't THAT stupid, that is how we know that this isn't some "This is the current amount of such and such in your inventory".
---
So please tell me why you and like 2 other people still believe that the email said "You were suspended for currently having over 100k of this item", when the email actually said "you were suspended for acquiring over 100k of an item over a 30 day period."
---
Why would they even mention a 30 day period if it was just based on having more than 100k of a rare thing?
---
What is needed is a Caps sink get them out of the economy.  The high priced Plans/Recipes that were made available should soak up some, but still needs more.
---
I did and I use my 2 shot weapons both vats and sighted. As long as I‚Äôm close enough to hit the target, it‚Äôs about the same. It‚Äôs not 1/1.5
---
I do but I have all three points into the class act card. Which according to the description should only be -12% to energy guns.
---
Aye. No one wants to watch you balls jiggle while you drum, mate.
---
Well, maybe not no one. But most people, at least.
---
Bonus effect. Dense mod makes you pretty much immune to scorch beast screams. Still lose AP, but it doesn't hurt you. Not just for explosives! 
---
Start the worlds largest water farm by the moth man museum 
---
That means both projectiles hit in that particular VATS shot.
---
Slap damage is 5 HP capped. There's percentage slap damage.

Not to put too fine a point on it but Sentinel description includes the word 'standing' and Cavalier 'sprinting' neither of which is possible while sneaking...

Or someone in the group wasn‚Äôt on pacifist... and tagged that guy
---
Perhaps this is phase 3 of the duper/cheat purge.
---
1. Temp suspensions
---
2. Delete mass amountsbig duped items (100k)
---
3. Delete derivative items (break the mutations), including items obtained from the duped items. For example, the serums and mods crafted from duped flux.
---
4. Move cheaters to a cheater server before survivor mode/PvP.
---
The point is the game is enjoyable, particularly with friends, and I'd like to engage in discussion of it without a bunch of mouth breathers screeching the same tired complaints.
---
I'm not a youtube fan, at least not for these guys putting out weekly game videos, and it boggles me that people are so willing to accept their opinions.  There's absolutely zero doubt that it's contributed the bandwagon bullshit you see on other social media.
---
&gt;We are about a month away from caps being completely useless.  
---
Caps have pretty much been useless since the game was released. Need chems? You don't buy them, you come across too many in the world. Buy ammo? Same story. Buy a weapon? Unless it's a legendary that someone else vendor'ed, you're likely going to craft your own or use a drop.  
---
Sure, if you're a completionist then there are plenty of CAMP plans and weapon/armor plans to buy, but if you're a casual player then there isn't a lot of incentive to try to buy them all.  
---
If anything, duping actually *created* an economy from a system where there wasn't one to begin with.  
---
I know the 1400 cap/day limit is something pretty much everyone complains about, but I think it's intentional simply for the fact that without it people would quickly realize how useless caps are.  
---
I actually wondered why dupers bothered with cap shops to begin with. The ones who were ebaying their items, sure making real money makes sense. But why bother selling for caps at all? They've got 5 characters maxed at 25k caps but have nothing to spend them on.  
---
i don't know if it's been around since day 1, but it's been an issue since i got the game a month or so ago, at least 
---
Yes, but by your math each projectile is 1/3 of the sighted projectile, so it can‚Äôt be right. I‚Äôm not hitting it with three projectiles
---
You are the IRL equivalent of a dumbass.
---
Not in my experience, I've seen my TS Lever actions second bullet hit multiple targets in ADS before 
---
Pacifist mode DOES NOT GIVE YOU PVP IMMUNITY. It only prevents YOU from accidentally attacking others. You can still be attacked when in pacifist mode. It even says so in the settings menu.
---
Ive seen loot change (since patch 4) from the second I kill the enemy, and when he settles on the ground. 
---
Its always too fast to actually read what was there before the loot gets rerolled upon death
---
This sounds amazing, what sort of missions do you do?

---
Everyone keeps talking about "popular YouTube personalities."

It seems like a huge bubble and echo chamber that I have no knowledge of the aside from people complaining about it here. I truly could not care less about them and could go the rest of my life without hearing about popular YouTube personalities.

I'll need you to go to Elwynn Forest and kill 9000 boars. And bring me their ears for a necklace.

Had a bounty when Tse was way overpowered and engaged in pvp for the first time with my tse pump. Got 30 pounds of junk from someone.

That defeats the purpose of CAMPs.
---
If level 150 players can go to uranium fever and 1 shot kill everything, then level 11 players can go hide at the scorch beast queen fight.  High- level players can't be allowed a monopoly on fucking up other peoples' game play. So.. .not level requirement for SBQ fight. 
---
Right... but we aren't talking about whether it's one projectile, I even posted as much. When both bullets hit the damage is calculated as if it were a single bullet. How much damage is what we're talking about... and two shot does not calculate mod damage on the second shot.  
---
A base weapon with 100 damage and two shot... the second shot does 25 damage. If both bullets hit the damage is considered to be 125 for one bullet.  
---
A base weapon with 100 damage and a mod that adds 25 damage and has two shot... the second shot still only does 25. It is not doing 25% of 125 damage. It is doing 25% of 100. If both bullets hit the total damage used for calculation is going to be 150. It's not going to be 156.
---
okay thanks

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Here is Bethesdas post from after patch 5, stating the method they were using to ban (picking up items).  In this case they had banned people with over 500k And other over 100k.  This post clearly illustrates that they are in fact counting the total amount of items you have picked up, IE aquired, over a 30 day period and not based on the items you have on you. 
---
Basically if you or I drop 5k rounds of an ultracite ammo and pick that ammo back up 20 times we would then be banned for having "ACQUIRED" 100K ultracite ammo despite the fact we were just moving the ammo to our mule and back to our main during SBQ fights for example. 
---
If you seriously want more evidence I can provide it, just because they are confident they are not banning people unfairly doesn't mean the are accounting for the min/max players with multiple accounts.  Everything I have provided you shows that based on their ban criteria there is a chance multiple people who were guilty of nothing were banned unjustly.
---
FYI they have been duped to shit idk what crack you‚Äôre smoking ir if you just have some your trying to sell for a ridiculous price but they‚Äôre all over eBay and I myself use both of those markets as well and people have them on there ALL THE TIME same with Facebook, they are literally all over the place and literally got mine for free as a bonus for another trade I completed. Just FYI üòÇ
---
I consider most of this speculative bullshit.
---
Just because 100,000 items is a factor they look at doesn't mean it is the only factor.
---
You wouldn't be satisfied until they personally hand delivered a list of accounts and exact items and reasons for the ban.
---
Which is fucking ridiculous. 
---
You are holding up Mr. 900 hours who has been proven a liar as your primary source.
---
BRING BACK BLACKBIRD!!!! 
---
Srsly kicking myself I didn't get it... 
---
What? Why are you so hell bent on giving diseases to griefers? Also, how do you distinguish legit PvP from griefing?
---
That's visually. TS ADS will always have 1 projectile, with the exception of weapons I listed. This has been proven.
---
Lol exaaaactly.
---
yeah they're in weird places I think. I checked both the armor and the power armor section of the ATX bsa if I remember correctly
---
OMG, Sympathies and laughter! :( :)
---
While I couldn‚Äôt get starvation to directly boost my damage, losing heath because of starvation will eventually drop you into higher tiers of boosted damage. Namely, falling below 10% health gives a +300% damage boost from adrenal reaction now. That is, once you remove pre patch adrenal reaction and successfully get a new mutation.
---
Glad you figured it out! That's weird though
---
When it's everyone but you, it's probably actually you that's the problem. I've disagreed with everything you've had to say, even with how you respond to people.
---
See, people like you are the problem, people that blame everyone except the people who are actually responsible. The *only* people responsible for the state of the game is Bethesda. No player here can be rightfully blamed for having realistic expectations, and I think most have been far too forgiving.
---
So you need to learn a few things. We are entitled to a working game. We are entitled to enough content at launch or shortly thereafter that it can be called a complete game.
---
Bethesda has been too busy nerfing things in the game, too busy banning people(too late), and very likely the wrong people at that.
---
They have zero excuses for anything that's happened, and I think the player base that's still left has been far more understanding than they should have been. Who's left isn't entitled, you're just blind.
---
I would say keep this quiet. That sounds like a good bug. Knowing beth, they will act quick to stamp out any good bugs, but will drag their feet to address anything that pisses all the players off daily
---
Then they should cap the per minute damage as well. 
---
I'm not level 30 yet, so no starched genes, and they I guess "fixed" the death cure, which sucks...I guess they don't want low level players to have mutations? Anyway, can anybody confirm the original question? Cuz I got mad Nuka Grape but I'm not using it til I'm sure. Thx
---
Where'd you get 1/3 from?
---
Dude, it's simply to calculate.
---
If you landed both projectiles, plug in the damage value that's on your pipboy.
---
If you landed one projectile, plug in half the damage value that's on your pipboy.
---
Dude, it's simple to calculate.
---
I run an explosive shotgun, so getting up and away from the horde is pretty much the only way not to blow myself up 50 times during the event. I can easily pick off the horde from up there so that's what I do, focusing on players on the ground getting attacked. Sorry you're butthurt that not everyone plays the way you want them to.

That being said try to understand that for someone like me that doesn't cheat or dupe or glitch that I don't have OP weapons and armor - what I do have I have grrrrrrrrriiinded for including purchasing Serums. My Build right now is so frigged up I don't know what's a Bug a Patch a Feature or something else entirely. I'm an average gamer just trying to play and the small edge I had to prepare to launch a nuke by myself is now gone.
---
The same people so quick to turn on Bethesda with the "do we *know* he did this?" are the same ones that refuse to think "do we know you didn't do this" on the sob story posts.
---
I've spend nearly $300 on this game buying the PAE for myself and the SE for a friend and experience the same glitches as everyone else *on top of* the whole bag situation. I don't approve with the game's release being so early and the bag being falsely advertised, but I know how the world turns.
---
Bethesda (the publisher) forced Bethesda (the developer) to release an unfinished game and allowed the bag to be falsely advertised; shitty.
---
Normal ass people are able to lie quite easily for media attention to cause uproar; shitty.
---
The world is shitty. Causing double standards only make things worse.
---
I did plug it in. Try it and see
---
I love t but it has setbacks many glitches such as pulling out your pip boy before the game fully loading will cause you to be stuck at a black screened pop boy stuck until you reset and other things but I love it I would suggest playing it if you don‚Äôt mind glitches 
---
Vault 94 in March

For me, it's stuck on Super Mutant Behemoth.  Killed one this morning, no credit for it.

I'd love to, but I don't know that I have much worth trading.

I just do my part and downvote every video I see like that on Youtube, don't watch the video so they get no ad revenue, and tell them they suck in the comments.  :)
---
I did plug it in. Try it and see. I‚Äôm only talking about shots that land both projectiles
---
Once again, this is not true.
---
Compare AA and TS, hardened and regular receivers. Look at the pipboy damage. You will see thay better receivers always give a flat percentage boost for every legendary effect; mods do not effect TS.
---
Found the 900 hours guy 
---
Ah, gotcha. It being an RP group makes a lot of sense.  
---
I actually wish I had joined one before I burnt out on the game. It was actually the main reason I bought the game. I just wanted to make funny RP videos with my friends, but most of them thought the idea was 'dumb.' okay.jpg  
---
I'd actually say that your group is the kind of group this game is really made for, people making their own content.

I ahve used scrounger for ages and it works fine.

If it lands both projectiles, you always use the number that's on the pipboy.
---
Only 1 cloth?  I was checking the datafile and the references to the Confederate hats all show 2 cloth.  Is there a perk that reduces the materials required for an outfit?
---
It's an established fact that the more people who are not on the ground, the less she lands,  
---
I have explored. Thats all I have really done. I don't team up and rush through the game. But I have been to every region now and have explored a huge chunk of each. The world felt huge when I first started but it feels like theres not many surprises left at this point. I just dont get how people can play until level 200. Idk. I just wish there was more to do at my level then wander aimlessly and fight the SBQ over and over. Some kind of fun activity area would be cool, like an arena were you can find and go in by yourself or with a team and press a button that makes a siren go off attracting hordes of enemies and you see how long you can last.
---
Just stop playing till private servers are a thing. No reason to keep playing while Bethesda continues to shit all over the place.
---
Wipes had nothing to do with ammos tho. It concerned stacked amount of tses aaes bes and other extremely rare items. Not ammos or most consumables
---
That's absolutely not the case. TOS have been held to be legally binding for upwards of 20 years now. 
---
Almost burned out pre-level 30 and it's your favorite Fallout world yet? Have you even finished the main quest? 
---
I bought my Serum from MODUS
---
That's why I'm saying, you NEVER use 2 x 62.5. That is simply calculated as 125, ALWAYS.
---
It's either 1 x 125 for both, or 1 x 62.5 for one.
---
Between levels 50 and 150, I've got several explosive guns. They are still pretty good. Many TS which aren't quite enough to me anymore, but we great between 40-100. One I stopped using only around level 160, it was a mere level 25 TS handmade. I kinda stopped because stock max level would have been better, but didn't want to go and craft one.
---
I've not seen god rolls either. Should one see, in about 3 months of gameplay?
---
The cap/vendor mechanic makes caps less and less valuable, as people accumulate enough.

It's not even 1% üòÇ

So you fix your mod problem yet?  LOL
---
As I was also having 'issues' with AR today I tested the OP's theory. Hunger and thirst had zero affect on my build, Tried with Anti Armour, Vampyre, frenzied and instigating weapons. Not to say OP is wrong it just had no impact on my character. What I did notice was AR was taking my 100% health as being my health minus any rad damage. So if I was 50% health due to 50% rad damage my base weapon damage was normal. If I was 50% health due to combat/weapon damage my weapon showed a significant uptick in damage.
---
100% health with AP lvl50 .50 cal HMG base damage= 71  
---
above weapon at 80% health and no rad damage = 75  
---
above weapon at 30% health and no rad damage= 107  
---
above weapon as 60% health with 40% rad damage, base damage =71  
---
my mutation list is , marsupial, birdbones, electrically charged and Adrenal. I stripped adrenal off before testing , logged off and on, reapplied serum, logged off and back on again. Tests were run during the 1 hour honeymoon period.
---
server hop naked in PA, should fix it I only had to do it once.
---
Yeah, but not everybody uses Reddit. Plus that way, people could see that I‚Äôm offering to craft calibrated shocks and jet packs without me having to make a post every time I get online. 
---
&gt; You are the one who said it‚Äôs work, I‚Äôm just agreeing with you.

Ah so you take things in the most literal way possible all the time?  Or only when it is convient for you? Or are you like Amelia Bedelia?

---
&gt; The workaround isn‚Äôt even working for everyone. 
---
You sure? Because every reply I've seen is like yours they do not want to remove mutations. 
---
&gt; Your analogy makes no sense at all.  
---
Neither does yours. They didn't break shit and they have worked out a work around to fix it. So they didn't just stand around telling you tough shit. 
---
I ended up doing it all the time after this post
---
I figured I'd see more noise here about it if it was broken for everybody, but definitely my lack of success with it is statistically implausible.
---
Why so much ammo? And why ultracite of all things?
---
I think my best source of good gear has been Watoga vendor.   Just picked up a chameleon, agi, weapon weight combat left leg.  The other day I saw a bloodied Minigun with damage while aiming and was short caps Bc of maxing out under armies.  Was gone when I came back.

That is one mans trash is another‚Äôs treasure and most of my mob drops are trash.  I think you are spot on in your assessment OP.
---
Why are you talking in circles?  I‚Äôm showing you why AA is slightly more damage than 2 shot
---
If you're on PC would group with you anytime.
---
Can you please also check if the Adrenal Reaction bonus damage curve change was an intended nerf, too?
---
That's just how probabilities work though. So maybe it's just a run of bad luck.
---
Lmao and all these people downvoting are just pissed that I‚Äôm right, sorry to ruin your sales! üòÇ
---
I have a couple lower levels I play with (I'm over 200) and I give them props, they've gone to do the Queen with me and get all up in there. I used to agree with you but honestly have no issue with low levels as long as they're putting in the work or at least *trying*. Even if the best they can do is run around as bait to get hordes to chase them and the Queen to land, at least they're contributing something to the fight.
---
The issue is the community. Maybe we should start picking off the moochers who hide in the shed, that'll discourage them from that behavior. 
---
Get that tantrum out. Maybe once you do, you might be able to actually read and understand what is said.
---
Because all of that is nothing but a bunch of selfish dribble. 
---
&gt; mods do not effect TS 
---
Man I don't even know what you're arguing now because I am trying to explain that mods do not effect Two-shot but now you're saying the same thing. The second bullet doesn't get additional damage from the mods applied to the gun.
---
Hot tub yeaaaahhhh
---
This is why I use ublock :)  
---
Also, never dislike/comment them. You may think that disliking someone somehow hurts the video, but it isn't. Both likes and dislikes are equal for increasing videos engagement score.   
---
And also get a "youtube video blocker", if you want to hide super annoying channels. 
---
Look man, I'm done talking to you.
---
I've checked your post history and you apparently think it is a player's duty to exploit games wherever possible.
---
Weight glitching, saved data manipulation in Monster Hunter. You even admit you run with the worst crowd when it comes to cheating. 
---
I have no interest in what you have to say on the matter at this point.
---
I agree to this level requirement! I'm almost level 50 and don't wanta be in the shed while the fight is on. For me I want to be able to fight and be apart of it. The shed peeps are for leveling quickly and getting the legendary drops. I'm building my character so I can take on the SBQ and be apart of the fight. I see on the map how the low levels congregate near the blast zone lol 
---
Alright, sorry for the delay I had to commute home from work.  I'll preface that I am also on xbox, so I suffer from the same player pool as yourself.  I feel like your "month away from being useless" is really just an arbitrary statement unless you have some sort of data projection or something you're basing a trend on.   Next I have to agree with you on the drop rate of valuable items being quite low. I'm still on the fence on whether it is where it should be or not.  My two main weapons were self-found and roll pretty good through the game content and end game.   On to the next point though where you say dupers kept the economy alive.  This is technically false, as they changed the economy into one of endless supply. Devaluing both the barter economy AND the cap economy.  Additionally it created an overabundance cap-sink items of high value (PA plans, serum recipes) for bottom tier prices.  1k for serum recipes anyone?  Normal cap gain from sellers is capped at 1400 a day.  Total cost of the cap sink plans is in the 100's of thousands.  Now I'm not trying to gloss over the "old" cost of the PA plans, but if you're sitting there with "all" of them learned, then I'm confident that you've benefit from some duped plans along the way.  The added "benefit" of the flood of top tier items in the game also changed what players like yourself would deem as serviceable for your gameplay.  I mean why not?  that's not your fault.  if you can score that sweet sweet TSE combat shotty for 5k on the trades, why would you use the two-shot reduced-AP cost pump that just dropped?   (or the instigating golf club 1\*)   Loot aside, I don't think the large majority of folks playing are in the same situation as you with the ability to scoop up 25K of caps in a couple days. I have seen what you talk about with the "specific for specific" trades becoming more prevalent in the xbox trades list.  any way, this is TLDR and as Jrobb below stated my arguments don't mean shit anyway right?
---
That‚Äôs fair, but I am level 67 and I am still finding many unexplored locations, and haven‚Äôt even really started the quest to kill the queen yet. 
---
I mean, the Axtinguisher in TF2 got unnerfed. 
---
Read my additional response to your prior.
---
I don't want any account pictures, I just want Bethesda to look into the claims that some people were not fairly banned properly.
---
I never said 100k was the only number they are using, in the case with the 900 hour guy that was their number.  Which btw unless you can show me any evidence he was lying about not being wrongfully banned I will just ignore.
---
I have no idea if he duplicated the items or not, only that it is absolutely plausible based on the evidence he could have been banned wrongfully.  I could use other people as examples but it's far more logical to use an example which has more views so I have more potential evidence.
---
Bethesda should not be banning accounts with any amount of ammo as the reason, the fact it can be crafted in high numbers makes it substantially different then fusion cores or Nuka colas.  And while they have stated it's a tally of picked up rare items, that fact aside it is actually very plausible that with 900h play time you could craft a half a million ultracite ammo.
---
Aside the one mentioned above which was part of the weekly campaign.
---
There was also other missions relating to Whitespring.
---
1. Recon the general area noting anything that would assist in the upcoming battle.
---
2. Ghoulmegadon, clear the outplaying buildings of as many ferals and ghouls. Collect 250 pds of scrapped junk and ammo.
---
3. Infiltrate and recon interior. Collect two tech docs and hand them in at camp venture.
---
4. Clear the perimeter of all robots and main entrance to Whitespring.
---
5. Breach and clear. Invade bunker and cause as much damage before tactically withdrawing.
---
6. As Victoriam. Launch Nuke from any solo at Whitespring, finish off the Enclave threat.
---
These missions are intended for high level groups.
---
We also have missions for solo low level players like take over the munitions Factory, retake Wade Airport and make it operational and power up Thunder Mountain.
---
Each week is different and you also get FP for certain enemies that you kill if you have photo to prove it.
---
It‚Äôs a Role Play group and we have loads of fun chatting and gearing up for the next missions. 
---
ROFL'd at this description!
---
No. When landing both projectiles (125%), my math clearly shows that TS always wins.
---
Pacifist mode can stop that from happening üòÄ, it only takes a few seconds to turn it back off if you're PvPing.
---
&gt; but is all this aggro really necessary?
---
You admittedly cheated -- knowingly using an exploit to stack duped bobbleheads -- because you got owned in the game, and you think everyone else is to blame? Dude.... you knew what you were doing.  You even admit you don't disagree with it. Nobody was under any obligation to explain to you exactly how you got caught cheating (and once again: you admitted already that you \*knew\* what you did, so it's not a realistic argument that you needed the community to "gather all the info and tell you what was going on" or that you would be "left in the dark".  
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. It's not hard to figure out.  But don't blame everyone else for being "aggro" for your own mistakes.
---
Yeah I think it is reaching mass-hysteria levels, it has gotten to the point that certain people need to try to bring others down for possible wrong assumptions to make themselves feel better about their viewpoint.
---
It's weird what will trigger people in this forum to be for, or against a given current wrong of Bethesda's.  I think duping or cheating is definitely one of those that rial people up!   One thing that is clear he duped, because I know, and like I said it is clear. ;)  And Bethesda got this 100% correct because their track record is impeccable as we all know. 
---
I use a deathclaw gauntlet, I doubt it has a sneak-breaking mechanic. Maybe having too much AGI breaks stealth?
---
IDK.   
---
I have thousands of boiled water and thousands of glowing meat steaks because on days where I'm on a call and can't do something more complicated I purposely do background activities like that so I don't have to do it later.  
---
If I was a ranged build, I'd likely do the same 
---
When you learn something from the experience. Doesn't sound like that's happened yet.
---
I'm sorry, bad wording.
---
I'm saying the amount of mods, and hence damage increase, don't affect how much TS adds. Check yourself with the weapons and receivers I mentioned; you'll see it's always a flat increase, meaning TS is always given a straight 25% boost, regardless of mods.
---
I just want filter options.  Build a container, while in the CAMP build menu you can enable filters on the container.  Make one container meds and aid only, one container weapons, one container armor and Power Armor frames etc.  They are all still attached to the full stash, but display just the types of stuff you want to display to make dealing with inventory faster.
---
You just found a paper bag with 100 flux randomly lying around?  
---
Yeah, OK. 
---
I had a guy show up at my camp, pissed off I stole his spot. I noticed he was wanted, with a huge reward, so I punched him. He proceeded to kill me, and rain down artillery fire on my camp. That day I learned how artillery is
---
The OP stated you need to be Starving (maximum hunger) for the damage buff to proc. The once proc it stays and scales with hunger level. 
---
A full team all wearing the costume get 60 hp. You can only find one in world, which means a team of four had to pay $30 (rounding up atom packs) to get 45 hp. That‚Äôs the equivalent of 9 points to endurance. I would say that is considerable, especially when there is a special point cap in the game.
---
Where did you get the idea that not wearing power armor was a disadvantage? There‚Äôs a reason full sets of sentinel armor will sell for more than the max account of caps allowed per character. Stealth is a major part of combat in fo76, no power armor can offer the same stealth as regular armor. Don‚Äôt try to pull that excuse when it only applies to maybe heavy gun builds.
---
And this is about protecting customers from being Bethesda‚Äôs expendable source of income. I‚Äôll ask again and **please answer**, why should a team of four have extra hp just because they spent money in the atomic shop if me and my friends all bought the game at the same price?
---
It's currently trapped in an unstable equilibrium between different types of unbalanced.
---
By that logic nothing can be considerred a buff cause its a nerf to a different playstyle.
---
Wait what's the dragon nerf?
---
Dude, you seriously need to delete this post. The misinformation is getting bad. I believe that you don't have bad intentions, but your claims are simply not true. Mods do not affect the boost a TS gets; it's always 25%, regardless of post-mod damage.
---
Lol, check my history all you want, I have never been banned from a single game in my life.  Using my saved game to look ahead in a list to get decorations is the same as logging back out of fo76 and in again to farm whitesprings again.
---
People shouldnt exploit a game in a way that negatively affects the playerbase nor do I think they should.
---
You are ignorant to think they are one and the same, good luck out there in the wasteland, hopefully you catch a wrongful ban at some point, you would be most deserving of the negative karma based on your negative mindset.
---
Yes, faction related stuff, BUT don't give it to us YET.  I want to see a faction system in game that you have to earn faction ratings to be able to get access to the faction related stuff.
---
You need to hit Starvation (max hunger) first, then damage buff supposedly procs, and scales with hunger level. 
---
You ever see the you tube video where 2 guys made a boxing ring out of foundations and fences? Funny as hell , fists only no armor , had to strip down to their undies...
---
I‚Äôm not going to bother explaining something that You could simply have read in OP‚Äôs post above, if you‚Äôre unable to do that, or can‚Äôt follow the equation properly then you‚Äôre not even worth trying to convince, go around telling people TSE still outperforms AAE, it‚Äôs fine by me ;) I‚Äôll still be melting people with my AAE.
---
I've only found it tedious to trade. 
---
Plenty of things to buy. Browsing for anything takes time, since a lot of trades are WTB posts about stuff that's pretty darn rare. (this might be quite different on PC where there's lots of more players)
---
Another is selling, you have to price pretty low any fairly ordinary legendaries you might find, if you actually want to sell.
---
Lots and lots of people want to be crafter. Thing is you can't craft if everyone is doing it. If you want to stick to that, you got to adapt.
---
 You don't use anything that's dropped because you want the better stuff that was duped into oblivion. I mean how else could you and anyone else, have the bying power for it?
---
I feel ya. All this garbage makes me wish I did cheat in the beginning. Then I would have done it all by now and just happily accepted the ban and moved on. 
---
I while I realize I havent explored every single building, the most satisfying part of exploration for me was finding a new spot and having a new quests related to that area that that I didnt know about pop up on my pipboy. I feel like I've found all the quests now. I do enjoy the lore and I read every terminal and note and listen to every holotape I can get my hands on, I just wish there were more quests to keep me occupied. I feel like the questlines are designed to take you to the soft cap, at least the way I played, which I though was pretty slowly, I spent most of my time exploring and searching for new quests and activities. I think I might just take a break until some or all of wild appalachia drops and then make a new character, since I just kind of picked whatever sounded cool for my perks I am not optimized at all, I am more of a jack of all trades without being great at anything since I have a few points in melee perks a few in rifles a few in shotguns ect.
---
&gt;Pestilence
---
The white horse of legend is actually more closely attributed to "Conquest" or "Victory", Pestilence is largely a modern pop-culture interpretation, that plus it's easier to relate to pestilence than conquest in this day and age where people usually frown on conquest.
---
There is nothing about getting huge amount in short time that was registered in logs in the system, they just saw the inventory and said "whoa, that's a lot of ammo, he probably cheating, let's ban him".
---
The planters that are already in game.
---
Tell your friends who can't play anymore I said "Hi."
---
They could make it easier to procure sudafed with all the outdoors to enjoy, though. I went camping up there and went to 7 pharmacies before one finally sold us sudafed. So protip: Bring sudafed with you to W.Va if nature wants to kill you.
---
Not really disproved that ts is more powerful because recoil is an important factor when it comes to dishing out damage, if my gun kicks up more, i could be missing shots or not hitting the weak points im intending to hit, what is extra damage if my bullets arent hitting or hitting where i want them to
---
did you really reply to yourself?
---
I was more hopeful than actually thinking it was likely. There are a few weird card descriptions/effects out there so figured it wasn‚Äôt crazy... although most of those are being patched anyway. 
---
Follow up question for you. Does that mean that cavalier only triggers literally while you are sprinting? So not just moving. I guess that‚Äôs right..
---
will give it a shot and see what I get :)
---
So now this alleged non-cheater, in order to actually be legitimate, has to in fact be a full four-man group, running multiple hours a night, every night, doing nothing but nukes? Leaving them zero time left to do any of the other grinding for the other, allegedly legitimately acquired, items \*not\* found there?   
---
Does that seem even remotely plausible to you? Cause it doesn't seem remotely plausible to me. 
---
Fake and gay
---
I will try it again and hope for the best, thank you for your help :) and now a mole rat is eating my CAMP... let's see if i can kill it ..
---
Not all flux is equally rare. 
---
Let me get this straight. Someone is actually playing fallout 76, and they love it enough to do 900 hours of gameplay, but Bethesda bans them. Man, they really do not want people to enjoy fallout.
---
Thanks for helping test this! I'm at work or I'd be testing :(
---
You trying to sell all of your old TSE‚Äôs and nobody wants them or something? Lol I can‚Äôt think of any reason besides stupidity that you‚Äôd be trying to convince people of this nonsense, I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt.
---
They sync to the app nicely too if you post on reddit from your phone and if you recorded from the Xbox 
---
None of my friends were banned.....good try tho troll.
---
Yup. Why didn't he trade it? Why bother picking it up at all? Why waste all this effort to hoard massive amounts of ammo and waste the weight spent better elsewhere?  
---
99% chance it's duped. 
---
Lmao okay dad
---
I say all the map except for workshop zones/areas should be barred from PvP on the adventure servers.  Make the PvP people play Survival mode instead.  So the majority of the map becomes non-PvP, including CAMPs, etc...  and only workshop areas have PvP if someone tries to take over an owned workshop.  Leave the workshop area and PvP is automatically disabled.  No slap system, no PvP elsewhere on the adventure servers.
---
Thanks for the resource. Going to put on my walking shoes and check out the forest locations
---
If you're doing Harper's Ferry runs to kill mutants, (and it's not mutants every time), you're not gathering the flux needed to get the ultracite ammo that prompted the ban we're talking about. So what you're describing is literally irrelevant to the problem.
---
We're about to get to choose between Adventure and Survival modes, why not add a 3rd mode of BETA.
---
BETA-Has latest server active. Adds a reporting feature while in game. Standard gameplay, has passive mode.
---
Adventure-Has latest update that has been tested for at least 2 weeks in BETA mode. Standard gameplay, has passive mode.
---
Survival-Has latest tested update. No passive mode. No wanted mode. No Legendary weapons or armor.
---
Actually, that is a point of contention by the people saying he is innocent because they say Bethesda won;t tell them what  registers as illegal and no one knows if its for total amount that just went through his account in 1 month or if it was for total amount on him at 1 time. 
---
Their point is that we don;t know what they use to issue a ban. It's also from the email posted what ever happened in a 1 month time frame. 
---
It could be fun but I see it being easily exploitable.  1000 XP for porting to vault 76, picking up an item right next to the posting, etc.
---
For those who don‚Äôt want this vague bullshit - This means it‚Äôll be changed to no longer benefit from it immediately, regardless of whether it was intended or not. 
---
Just another secret nerf in the next update that only dataminers will reveal.
---
The same thing happened when the game came out and the gaming press just ran poorly researched hit jobs on the game because it was easy karma from their readers. (Hur durr bad game.)
---
Don't kid yourself, the gaming journalism industry is shallow as fuck and extremely lazy for karma whoring readers. Always. The only difference is this sub agreed with the anti-76 articles being spammed because anything new in fallout is bad. Nothing changed. 
---
And before you fuckers jump on me, yes 76 has some objectively bad game designs and was rushed, but it's not anywhere near as bad as the gaming smear articles would have you believe. 
---
mmmnnn the tears are so tasty... so salty, yet so sweet.
---
But those TSE and other items were the items that were mass duped, ammo wasn't. So it literally makes no sense to delete those items before you plan to ban people for having too many of rare items. 
---
By removing those rare items all that does is help dupers not get caught by removing the huge stacks of those items from their inventories. 
---
That is why it is obvious that what I said previously is how they are doing it and why everyone aside from you and jstengah realize that this banwave wasn't from currently having a huge stack of items, but from "acquiring" over 100k items over a 30 day period.
---
You also didn't answer my question, if all they were looking for was current number f items someone had why did they mention 30 day period?
---
Same but this is the first time i got the loot x9 instead of it settling on just 1 thing. 
---
Wow radium rifles arent at watoga station anymore? They were there like 75% of the time I serverhopped pre patch 5 (and many times the only thing there).
---
The MG42 is so far from reality.  The real deal can fire those 60 rounds in 2 seconds, the one in game is so nerfed it's amazing they bothered to call it a real gun name at all.
---
I'm literally the OP of the post he is referring to. Check my post, you'll see the math there...
---
We have the right equation, he simply forgot the last step, which is to apply the multiplier to base damage.
---
Maybe be a better parent and don't let your son obviously cheat with huge stacks of nuka-cola's he couldn't have legitimately earned. 
---
Well yes, but we're talking about damage here.
---
For 40? Yeah probably, it has improved.
---
This is a great idea‚Äîeven if fallout doesn‚Äôt use this, having an MMO with community quests and independent payment is really cool. Are there other games that do this? 
---
Honestly from the broken as fuck release, which is still inexcusable no matter how people here spin it, to the canvas bag bullshit, and then the leaking of people's details, and then the utter onslaught of dupe glitches that appeared one after the other... What a fucking rollercoaster. And then there's fans shit talking news sites that ''bash'' Bethesda. I get the issue with this specific story given that nothing about it has been factually confirmed, but pretty much everything else... God forbid those news outlets make sure people know 76 was a gigantic dumpster fire from the moment it released so Bethesda might learn and not pull this shit on its fanbase again. It's been enough with this ''games as a service'' bullshit, and hopefully this'll be a lasting big fat stain on their already shaky reputation
---
The game is a good game if you have a friend to play it with and dont mind grinding for a while. The game lost charm for me after the end game of launching a nuke. Worth to me though, tbh.
---
Because that is the end game ammo and the end game is fighting scorched, and will most likely have more scorched endgame in future content.
---
Fallout has always been a game for hoarders, some people just like to collect as much of whatever just incase they need it later.
---
Like I said, check the math. You'll see he missed the last step of the equation.
---
I don't get why you're so insecure that you come in, insults blazing, without anything of substance to say.
---
I met some random dude at a workshop one day that killed me and then invited me to a team. He invited me to his discord channel that he set up and he seemed nice enough. A few days later he writes to me and tells me he found a TSE gatling plasma and I was like "congrats" and he was like "yeah now i just need a few thousand bobbleheads so i can kill everyone at SBQ" and I was like "uuuh why?" and he was like "EH it's just for fun! Plus they should expect to die at SBQ and its not my fault if someone takes their loot". So I tell him that's kind of a dickhead thing to do and he calls me a judgemental asshole then removes me from the discord channel and fallout. He was trying to get my approval on doing it so he could feel less bad about doing it probably, because deep down i think he knows it's a dickhead thing to do, he's just trying to justify it.  
---
So yes I strongly agree with you that the one place you shouldn't be able to get backstabbed is at the SBQ fight when you want your back free to DPS the queen. She would never die if all the people there were too paranoid of other players to shoot at her.
---
Perhaps, if you're not spending \*any ammo\* during that time, or participating in \*any other\* game play during that time. But that's not the behavior observed by the people who are crying "false ban".    
---
Put another way: even if it's possible to legitimately acquire that amount of ammo by poopsocking, we know these players weren't poopsocking (from their histories, and often from their own admission). 
---
Ive seen that or something similar happen before (pre patch5) with some quest item I think, where It had like 15 holotapes 
---
I have no friends 
---
Im just sayin what hes done is not out of the realm of possibility.. he stated he was out of work due to an injury and spent all his time in the game since he had nothing to do.
---
I play 6 hours a night and have several people that come find me to go do stuff with very seldom am i alone in the evenings but on my days off when on im game at 9 or 10 am i am solo until 6 or 7 pm when those getting off work start coming in.  Then for the next 4 or 5 hours since they go to bed before i do we are running nukes and so on.. im not 900 hours or lvl 455 like him but i am over 600 hours and lvl 211.  Does that make me a cheater as well? Only reason im not a higher level is i dont grind because when alone im just wandering around the country side.
---
Jim Sterling covered this as as usual he danced around the facts, didn't put in any research and and click bait titled his video to the effect of "Bethesda bans 900 hour player for having too much ammo". 
---
Iam amazed in how much trust you put into a company that not only has lie over and over again to your face they are incompetent they cant patch shit mods patched, their updates bring back bugs already patched and now you expected me to belive the shit they are saying? lol
---
Lol I've got about 20k left but using them for "currency" ATM.  
---
Going to sound weird, but shotgun shells are more of a pain for me than most Ultracite ammo.  
---
I usually have a few extra fluxes, a couple thousand Ultracite, but I'm always short on plastic 
---
&gt;So basically IMHO a 900 hour player could have millions of rounds, or 10 million rounds (I've likely given away a few million rounds of ammo) of Vanilla Ammo, and it's within the range of what is doable.
---
So I could have half a million. I don't think I even got 100k in total. I do probably have more than average, as I use a lot of .44 I can buy from others, and with the lead I get, I craft 5.56 and shotgun shells, which I don't use all. Sure I could have a lot more,  if I were into farming it.
---
&gt;So basically IMHO a 900 hour player could have millions of rounds, or 10 million rounds (I've likely given away a few million rounds of 
---
Well, lets wait for that person to show up? Someone playing 900 hours of this game, ain't no snowlake in Sahara.
---
Yes, the condition 'IsSpriting' has to be 1 (True) for the damage mitigation to apply.
---
At this point I am unsure however whether the VATS melee 'sprint' satisfies that condition too. 
---
&gt; You still have disconnecting issues? Hells with *your* ~~game~~ internet.  
---
Much appreciated!
---
I had a 1000% stored camp budget a few weeks ago after moving my camp, you literally have to manually scrap everything, I had like 200+ walls, foundations and ceilings it was tedious. But before that I made the biggest base I could it was pretty cool
---
He's not denying any facts. You're the only one selectively acknowledging shit here, scrub.
---
That‚Äôs really good info. Thanks. 
---
Nope, but I drop tons of flux and hardened mass
---
Ahhh, that makes more sense thank you 
---
Drop them boy. Find another game company thats worth your time
---
 Mules are against the TOS? Gimme a line # or something, that's some stupid stuff which is ignored by like everyone they aren't going to ban for that.
---
Even PUBG, a game that only has ONE server for all of north america, somehow has a test server to let community volunteers vet changes before they go live untested.
---
Nope. Serious dupers that had more than 1000 of each tses were banned long before the wipe happened. And bethesda decided to control lesser hoarders with wipes. Why didn't they just plain ban them? Bethesda did mention that they are aware of the fact that duped weapons made up about 80% of trades and didn't want to ban innocent players holding small collection of tses
---
Or I know this might be hard to believe because it requires some nuance, but maybe BSG hit a few innocent people too. You know outliers like people who spend crazy amounts of time on the game that is outside the norm for most players. I mean the people in this subreddit has since done the math and if he was multiboxing he easily could have reached the amount of ultracite ammo he did in a week of hard grinding. Source:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aset43/ammo_crafting_math_re_is_it_possible_to_craft/egwlui5/
---
That is from Aten_ra a very well known and trusted member of this community.
---
Now, why is it you think that out of everything BSG has done with this game this would be the first time they didn't mess something up? Because literally every single patch they have put out since this game released has created a new bug. So why is it so hard for you to believe that they possibly could have made a mistake on some people in this ban wave as well?
---
Can you **prove** someone has been banned for merely picking up a stack of flux?  I'll wait.

ok, sure but like i've said a thousand times why 140,000? And why ultracite yes you fight scorched but as a play myself I like to find the best way to make one thing powerful and then do it. So I see no reason in constantly farming for items that arn't even that good that are used for one thing and can't be cashed out very easy.
---
If you mean back in the shredder then Yes, do that.or you can sift through the Patch Notes, nuclear dumpster fire threads/posts and play with your broken gear &amp; builds; maybe tears will put out the fire /shrug
---
In a PvE setting, does it matter that much? I still maintain that PvP would still be not that u balanced because you can't wear armor over the Mistress costume, which itself offers small protection. This essentially gives the non paying team a one man advantage.
---
You question can also apply to othe ridiculous situations. Suppose the toy event is going on whee toy cars give you health. Suppose you are at carry cap so have no toys. I have a few toys on me that give me +50 hp. Why should I have more health for having better inventory management skills?
---
They paid money for the costume, not the boost. The boost was to simply incentivize the purchase of the set. By your logic, no one would ever want to buy cosmetics. 
---
But now your argument can be flipped. Suppose my team does not pay a single cent. We play more and earn more atoms till we can buy the set, while you don't. Why *shouldn't* we be rewarded for playing the game more and better than your team did? Your argument would hold if the game never gave us Atoms in game. On the contrary, almost any action grants a few atoms in game.
---
So ignore the 30 day question I asked again...
---
It is a good game, especially at $40. You an enjoy it solo or with teammates
---
That's exactly why, they all assume because they cant make that much no one could have.  Just like the same group of trolls assumes if you had a TSE gun you must have duped it or bought a duped one because they never had one drop for them.
---
Wow 80/100 Bethesda.  X01 could have been better
---
Mayne you should eat a Snickers. 
---
username checks out
---
Bethesda has lost everything with that game and things they do around it.
---
This is brilliant.
---
I didn't want anything when I was a low level because (a) I didn't know if other players were trying to fuck with me and (b) I just wanted to play the game organically and not feel like I took a shortcut somehow.  If you want to help new players just put modest amounts in containers around Flatwoods and the Overseer's camp.
---
Does that make me a super because I have what I have? A few thousand 1* items...
---
Close to a thousand 2* and 3* items and a good amount of ammo and bulk?  
---
The Occam's Razor defense only works when there are not viable alternatives...   
---
I can't say whether or not "900 hours guy" duped or not, but I can say, contrary to popular opinion, before the "Black Tuesday" patch making insane amounts of X,'if you were also an insane hoarder, was not only possible, but arguably "easy". 
---
fast travel mat
---
If he played 8 hours a day every day, it would be 112.5 days of playing. That is over three months of playing every single day. 
---
Lots of players got stuck in a false sense of security. Whoever gave you the ultracite was probably being helpful, too. People.dont deserve bans like this. 
---
The game works fine fir me on ps4
---
Dude 3 post before you some one did the math and even posted screen shots so yea is more than doable. 
---
I've posted this before, but by Bethesdas own admission they are counting picked up totals not totals the person has.  He may have only had 5k ultracite ammo that hes moved 28 times (I drop stuff at my camp when overburdened so I can run while out of armor and building stuff).  He also has 3 Mules, so moving stuff that often would be anything but unreasonable.
---
Xactly....
---
Okay, I LOL'd. Thank you.
---
That, and doctors out there seem to love writing prescriptions for Subutex instead of Suboxone.
---
Concrete building set.
---
I think you can still have fun in the game without friends. At least through the quest line. All the grinding in higher levels and after you complete the main quests, that is a bit boring without another person, but hell, $40 for the Tricentennial version is definitely worth it, regardless if you have anyone to play with imo. Just don't do what I did when I was solo, and burn through the main quests in under 2 weeks, because like I stated above, after the main quests, it's a bit sluggish for solo gameplay, to which you almost need a 2nd person to play with, maybe a full group of 4 even. But yeah, overall, to your main question, I'd say go for it and get it 
---
Your example is biased as hell if you're going to assume he was working with .50 ammo.  It's one of only what, two types of ammo that craft in bulks of 100?  Even just dropping down to the next lowest tier of ammo that crafts in bulks of 20 your numbers have to adjust by multiples that push it beyond belief.
---
Then you've accounted for the raw flux but there's more to crafting ultracite ammo.  You'd have to be nuking Whitesprings over SBQ enough so that you're gathering enough Hardened Mass/Glowing Mass/High Radiation Fluid, and even if you're gathering more flux from Whitesprings than from SBQ you'd need to gather even more of the others or the excess flux will all just go to rot.
---
Then beyond the flux you have to account for the ultracite itself.  Going off of your example of 2250 flux that means 2250 ultracite.  Maybe my luck sucks but when I bother to kill a scorchbeast I usually at best get a single wing or bone so that's like 75 SB kills a day which can't be efficient with all the ammo used.  So if instead you go with gathering ore it's still going to be 5 ore per 2 scrap and even with SD you're looking at  something around 5000 ore, which then need the same amount of acid.
---
So that means hitting 5+ nuke zones a day, taking the time to gather all the flux possible, gathering enough Bloated Glowing One drops to match all of that flux, and then gathering all of the necessary ultracite AND the acid, steel lead and gunpowder?
---
&gt; Therefore bsg can determine how many of each item you have at any given time (given the time/effort to make it happen; which they did).
---
But not all the time. Nothing has the capacity to do that.
---
Everything is better than 1.25 shot. Don't say that they'll Nerf it to. 
---
You can see the identical mod loadouts [here](https://imgur.com/a/um7QRu7) with the Hardened Receiver. The AA is three stars, but the other two stars don't affect damage at all. Both are max level, and as ranged weapons are unaffected by durability. I had someone else in this thread verify my numbers themselves and they confirmed. Someone also did the same with Handmade Rifles, which came out to a 19.2% damage gain with TS, not 25%.
---
I‚Äôm sorry dude this sucks ass. I hope your injury heals fast. 
---
Come join us on ESO. No one will blink an eye at insane farming and you‚Äôll make lots of friends fast. 
---
Not necessarily, what you‚Äôre saying is a different flavor of a similar statement. Fireproof directly reduces one build‚Äôs damage, buffing day, auto receivers makes them better vs. all other weapons, without reducing effectiveness or usability of them. The first is a nerf, second is a buff.
---
That's the thing, the ammo isn't worth the trouble to eBay, I mean I could be wrong, but based on experience with other MMO's the nickel and dime of "consumables" isn't worth it unless your moving large volumes.  
---
He'd make a better return farming other things, or if he was a duper, duping more profitable items.
---
Sure lest trust bethestha they have never lie or screw over customers........... fucking idiots 
---
can i have some water
---
Ultracite ammo crafts more than regular ammo by default. For example 1 craft of 5.56 ammo with Ammosmith = 36 bullets. 1 craft of ultracite 5.56 ammo with Ammosmith = 72 bullets.
---
Given that I wanted to be farming nuked zones anyway for exp/leggos I would always be farming nuked zones anyway, this essentially tripled down on reasons why I kept farming nuke zones.
---
Yeah.... I had a popular suggestion a while back that pretty much stated they need to buff the underpowered stuff so it can compete with the overpowered stuff, instead of just blindly nerfing everything into the ground.
---
Yes, and damage is heavily tied to dps, dps is just as important as talking about damage numbers when it comes to a lot of different weapons, recoil affects dps and therefore recoil is relevant to determining whether something is more powerful or not
---
u can eat and boost your hunger once this procs. So you can keep this damage boost even above 10%, u gotta keep ur food at 20% though.
---
I did record it on xbox and found how to save it to my phone but the subreddit doesn't let you post videos
---
If a guy obtains 100k tses and sells them on e-bay over a 30 day period and has nothing left now, should bethesda ban him or not? 
---
No
---
I enjoy games that feature banwaves and watching everyone get upset they got caught red handed taking advantage of the sytem. Just like in real life, you get caught, you get fucked, and people enjoy watching it (like me).
---
A long time ago they said (and it was seen in the patch notes) that they are working on these areas for the new pvp patch. 
---
&gt; it's telling when people would rather rail on Fallout than just play something else. 
---
It inspires anger to see a beloved property devalued and abused.
---
&gt; you literally have to manually scrap everything,
---
Do I have to break down my entire Camp?
---
I literally just got the anti-radiation shower the last time I played months ago I won't let Bethesda take it from me !
---
lmao! Too good! Lmao!!!
---
That would be a cool temporary thing for Christmas. Little presents instead of brown bags.
---
Well, as far as the BBPR, that drops in damage most likely due to your armor resistances. If I'm not mistaken, berserker's does more damage the lower your resistances, so take off all your armor, if you haven't already, and you'll be doing above the 335 damage that is says. As for the other weapons, I don't know what that's about. Maybe it's some visual bug due to the berserker's effect being active, but I assume it fixes itself after you un-equip the BBPR, correct?
---
My normal "I have stuff for you" emote is spamming a couple different ones.
---
So far I haven't had anyone shoot or run away when I come sprinting out of the forest with the sacrificial mask, clown outfit, and machete, spamming heart, heart, heart, trade, finger guns, then drop a pile of ammo. 
---
&gt;  I've been playing FO4 since patch 4 kept disconnecting me from the server
---
so this was 3 years ago?
---
That's a theory made by a reddit user with an idea, plus if you have to transfer ultracite ammo 28 times between accounts you need to re-think how you manage time, and the why? Why would you move it so many times? I have a mule and once the items are on my mule they only leave when I need them.
---
You didn't answer my question. Does it sound remotely plausible to you?   
---
Do you think it's realistic to expect that all of the people who were falsely banned -- or even most of them -- were in fact, really playing the game as essentially a full-time job doing nothing but grinding ammo or colas, and launching nukes to get flux,  in full 4 man groups at all times for a full month?   
---
Or is it more likely that the overwhelming majority of those bans are legitimate, and players are grasping at straws to try and weasel out of getting caught red-handed?   
---
In a previous job, it was not uncommon for us to catch someone red handed shoplifting, on video, and watching them spin elaborate lies about how they couldn't possibly have done it, literally while we're showing them the video proof of them doing it.  People lie when they get caught doing something they know was wrong. That's basic human behavior. 
---
Because they are........... iam started to think they are paying you guys, i refuse to belive human beings can be this stupid.
---
Yes, and that is the point, what you are claiming where they only look at how much they currently have that person WOULDN'T get banned. That is why your idea where "oh they were just looking for total amounts currently on the characters" doesn't work, because most of them would be gone from either being sold or deleted from the mass deletion.
---
Thanks, homie.
---
I can say I've found a handful of good stuff. Okayish heavy combat armor that I use BOS on and a GREAT fireax and two shot Lever action with +1 agility and 33% chance to hit in vats. I will say that those are about the only nice things I've gotten though 
---
The fireax is truly incredible though, +1 strength, 50% armor pen and 40% power attack damage 
---
From r/all as well and I reckon they've done you a favour mate. I had a look at when this game launched and it appears you've spent around 38% of all available time playing this game (over 50% if you account for 7 hours sleep per 24 hours), that's incredibly unhealthy.
---
Maybe you should take this one on the chin, turn off your computer, and do something else...
---
I think his argument was that he was currently on workman‚Äôs comp or disability or something. 
---
Take it with a grain of salt of course. 
---
I killed one and made a post about 2 minutes before yours, I got 3 legendaries off it but it also killed me several times before I managed to kill it
---
Hell yeah. 10/10 would hop in and test stuff up
---
Actually this line of thinking is the problem. Its not like they earned those level 200 by playing the game. They used exploits to level that fast. 
---
You do realize that the number in the pip boy is not the base damage, don‚Äôt you?  It‚Äôs your effective damage. 
---
The base damage for a 1s gun and a2s gun are the same, but there is a 1.25 (or .625 * 2) multiplier applied to the 2s. There are other multipliers applied based on your perks. Take off rifleman and the number changes. Why?  The gun didn‚Äôt change, your multipliers did. 
---
I‚Äôm telling you that the base damage is used for the armor calculation and the 1.25 multiplier is applied separately. They are multipliers. They multiply together. 
---
But the real base damage is used to calculate the damage multiplier and that is the same for a 2s and a 1s and an AA. In an AA, the target armor is altered, but the base damage is still calculated at 1x
---
THEN the 1.25 or 0.625 is applied. 
---
I'd have those numbers in total had I not both giving out since the beta and since "Black Tuesday" shedding ammo I don't need and isn't sought after.  
---
And since another person, a "Market 76" trader got banned for having too much ammo, I'm willing to bet others are also ditching overstock ammo to avoid a ban (unwarranted or otherwise)...  
---
All that aside, id be shocked if someone did step forward, more than a couple people have claimed to have "reported me for duping" when they see thousands of 1* (no, not 2*'s or TSE's) on one of my mules...  
---
Think of the fallout (no pun) if someone did show 1,000,000 rounds?
---
I don't use scrounger a whole lot, because I don't really have a hard time getting ammo to begin with, but if it is glitched for you, then damn, that sucks. Otherwise, if it's just a string of bad luck, then damn, that still sucks lol. Hopefully it starts to work for you, because it is a nice perk to use if you're low on ammo
---
It's like they've never seen an online game before.
---
&gt;Why add push-to-talk, when we can force everyone's mic open by default? Oh, but let's add the option to turn it off. Because forcing open mics will encourage interaction and no-one will turn it off at the earliest possible moment.
---
Got any treasure maps? ;)
---
Yes, but your math is wrong. Sorry. 
---
ok, so did you actually have 140,000 ultracite ammo or did you swap it one too many times? Or is it because you know the mechanics too well? And I;m also curious what your build is. If that isn't too much to ask?
---
Don't go into the buses.
---
Yeah, I can see that perspective.  Even spin off games in other series I loved annoyed me, but only for a minute then I forgot about them.  People shit on Fallout 76 because they can, not because they care ( for the most part ).
---
They wanted the ATOM shop to be pay-to-win, but they saw the shitshow that was Battlefront 2 and decided to remove it, but it was too late to re-jig the drop rates.
---
Ah, kind of like chunks in Minecraft lol. That‚Äôs interesting info, thank you. :-)
---
Doesn't matter it does more damage if not as many shots hit.
---
Me too!! Like the blackbird paint I almost passed on it !! But it‚Äôs my fav so far !! I also forgot to mention with all the bad press and game issues you would think Bethesda would of offered skins or faction armor /Power armor paints ,anything !!! to keep the faith and goodwill flowing with us diehards that are still playing -but again that incredible greed that‚Äôs taking over the game industry festers and keeps souring fan opinion of Bethesda!! It‚Äôs incredible these items don‚Äôt have any major development cost, almost all of them assets from FO4 yet they want to keep gouging the players for more!!!just wait hot rod red , pink,shark and atom kats will pop up next in the AS as vintage limited time items!!! It‚Äôs sad man totally sad!! 
---
Probably 5-10 last time I looked, watcha thinking??
---
Yes, but your math is wrong. Sorry. Why not test it for # of shots to kill? They‚Äôre about the same
---
Thank you! Melee seems like the go-to here. I loved melee in FO4 because of the perk where u could basically teleport in VATS. I‚Äôll give it a try :)
---
I was a newbie at the overseers outside camp for the first time. I hear someone running up on me coming down from the mountain. I look and it's this hot chick with a super sledge with a misty spell around it, I was like whoa. She then proceeded to slam me with it lol She killed me and it pissed me off. I re-spawned back in and she was standing there looking at her Pip-girl. I snuck up behind her with the rifle barrel to the back of her head and shot her. No damage and she let me have it again lol. I went to another server.. She was smokin hot though (: 
---
Kill those moles! :D
---
I gave one example of one item.
---
I've posted this before, nothing says he had 140k ultracite ammo, he could have just as likely moved 5k ammo 28 times (something very plausible with 2 accounts and numerous mules).  They are banning based on the amount of items you have picked up regardless if you just dropped those items.
---
For example you could drop and pick up the same stack of ammo for 1 day and would get banned based on the method they are using to ban people.
---
They should ban exploiters,  but they should also do so in a way that doesn't ban min/max players playing with friends or a second account. 
---
I'm in the same boat as you OP.  I've pretty much told myself i'm not coming back until we get some kind of category sort on the virtual stash bucket depending on what storage you access from.    
---
IE Accessing from a trashcan shows junk items.  Accessing from a dresser -apparel/armor.  Accessing from a safe -weapons/ammo.  Accessing from Fridge -Food/Water etc. etc.  
---
~~Vault-tec~~ Bethesda thanks you for your patience. 
---
It can go either way.. but were talking ammo here and the assumption that passin or making ammo back and forth (as some have claimed) gets flagged as well.. 
---
I feel some of these could be legitimate false bans, i also feel there could be warranted bans for duping but how does anyone pick an choose who was legit and who wasnt?
---
Do i beleive him? I honestly dont know. I havent dug into his posting history to get a feel for him. Do i beleive a serious player could do what he did? Yes without a doubt.
---
I like the idea that someone had a few days back that a random mob in a non-fissure prime nuke zone becomes a 50 foot tall three star legendary that had to be taken down by half the server like the queen. Skipping through the gilliflowers is nice and all but nukes should really be more eventful than making a nice arrangement.
---
